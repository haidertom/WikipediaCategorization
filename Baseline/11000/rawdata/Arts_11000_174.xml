'''Bobby Baker''' (born 1950, Kent) is a multi-disciplinary [[artist]] and [[activist]] working across performance, drawing and [[Multi-media artist|multi-media]]. Baker is the artistic director of the arts organisation Daily Life Ltd.

==Information==
Baker lives in [[London]], England. She studied [[Painting|painting]] at [[St. Martins School of Art]] (now Central Saint Martins) between 1968 and 1972. She was awarded an [[Honorary Doctorate]] by [[Queen Mary University]] London in 2011. In a career spanning over four decades she has, among other things, danced with [[meringue]] ladies; made a life-sized edible version of her family; and driven around the streets of [[Haarlem]], Holland strapped to the back of a truck yelling at passers by through a [[megaphone]] to ''Pull Yourselves Together''.

Daily Life Ltd is an arts organisation that produces the work of Baker and others. Together they create powerful art that investigates and questions the way people think about [[feminism]], [[daily life]] and [[mental health]]. These artworks cross many disciplines and provide unique, high quality artistic experiences for a wide range of audiences both nationally and internationally. They seek to challenge the [[stigmatisation]] and discrimination of people with experience of [[mental distress]] and raise public awareness of this vital sector. In March 2011 Daily Life Ltd became part of [[Arts Council England]]’s National Portfolio.

==Activism==
Baker's 2009 [[Wellcome Trust]] Diary Drawing [https://wellcomecollection.org/exhibitions/bobby-bakers-diary-drawings] exhibition about her experience of mental illness and recovery launched her onto a worldwide platform of mental health and arts campaigners, connecting her with a growing network of organisations and practitioners. Since then, she has aimed to use her position to help promote and foster opportunities for diverse marginalised artists. Her work focuses on undervalued and stigmatised aspects of everyday life and human behaviour, expressly undertaking to foreground the lives of women in the mainstream and bring status to so-called ‘humble’ daily activity.

As an internationally acclaimed female artist with personal experience of mental illness and physical disability, Baker offers an authentic figure of recovery and leadership through creativity. She is uniquely positioned with the experience, insight, talent and extensive cross-disciplinary network to investigate and celebrate creative ways people manage difficulties and disenfranchisement.

[[Image:100 views edo 010.jpg|thumb|In this print, [[Hiroshige]] used bokashi in the foreground, at the horizon, in the sky, on the priest's robes, and in the square cartouche]]

'''''Bokashi''''' (Japanese: ぼかし) is a technique used in [[Woodblock printing in Japan|Japanese woodblock printmaking]].  It achieves a variation in lightness and darkness ([[Lightness (color)|value]]) of a single color or multiple colors by hand applying a gradation of ink to a moistened wooden printing block, rather than inking the block uniformly.  This hand-application had to be repeated for each sheet of paper that was printed.

The best-known examples of bokashi are in the 19th-century ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' works of [[Hokusai]] and [[Hiroshige]], in which the fading of [[Prussian blue]] dyes in skies and water create an illusion of depth.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=102}} In later work by [[Hiroshige]], for example the series ''[[One Hundred Famous Views of Edo]]'', most prints originally featured bokashi such as red-to-yellow-to-blue color sunrises.

==Techniques==

Gradations can be created on the blocks themselves using the ''{{transl|ja|itobokashi}}'' technique, or brushed on by hand using ''{{transl|ja|fukibokashi}}''.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=102}}  They can also be done freehand directly onto a print, without using a printing block.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=106}}

===''Fukibokashi''===

''{{transl|ja|Fukibokashi}}'' requires gradations of ink to be applied to the printing block.  This is not a precise technique; its results are inconsisistent from print to print.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=102}}

The technique ''{{transl|ja|ichimoji bokashi}}'' ({{lang|ja|一文字ぼかし}}, "straight-line bokashi") is the one associated with the works of Hokusai and Hiroshige.  Ink is applied only to one end of the brush's bristles, and the brush is drawn across the desired portion of the printing block; this area is first wetted with a ''{{transl|ja|zōkin}}'' cloth, so that the ink bleeds somewhat across the wet area.  This creates a gradation at the width of the brush.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=103}}

[[File:Red Fuji southern wind clear morning.jpg|thumb|alt=|The darkened peak of Mount Fuji is an example of ''{{transl|ja|hakkake bokashi}}''.&lt;br /&gt;''[[Fine Wind, Clear Morning]]'', [[Hokusai]], {{circa|1830}}]]

In ''{{transl|ja|futa-iro bokashi}}'' ({{lang|ja|二色ぼかし}}) two colours are worked toward each other, achieved by applying two inks to opposite edges of the brush.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=106}}  In ''{{transl|ja|hakkake bokashi}}'' a flat colour is printed, and then the same printing block is washed and re-brushed with a ''{{transl|ja|bokashi}}'' effect to overprint over the first; this technique is seen on the dark peak of Mount Fuji in Hokusai's ''[[Fine Wind, Clear Morning]]''.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=106}}

===''Itabokashi''===
''Itabokashi'', or 'block shading,' is a technique used to produce ruffled edges on areas of color. It is produced by first cutting an area slightly larger than needed for a color, then abrading the edges of that area to make the transition from that color less sharp. This is commonly used in clouds and shading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/i/itabokashi.htm|title=JAANUS / itabokashi  板ぼかし|last=System|first=Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users|website=www.aisf.or.jp|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Freehand techniques===

Some techniques are performed freehand, without using a printing block, and results can vary considerably from print to print.  ''{{transl|ja|Kumadori bokashi}}'' is used for finer details, such as around eyes, and requires the artist to draw with a brush loaded with ink on a wetted area; as with ''{{transl|ja|ichimonji bokashi}}'', the bleeding of the ink into the water creates gradations.  ''{{transl|ja|Atenashi bokashi}}'' is similar, requiring the wetting of areas to be inked, and is used for details such as clouds.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=106}}

The '''Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier''' (in [[French language|French]]: ''Tombe du Soldat Inconnu'') is located before the [[National War Memorial (Canada)|National War Memorial]] in [[Confederation Square]], [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]]. The culmination of a project begun by the [[Royal Canadian Legion]], the tomb was added to the war memorial in 2000 and holds the remains of an unidentified Canadian soldier who died in France during [[World War I]]. The soldier was selected from a cemetery in the vicinity of [[Vimy Ridge]], the site of a famous Canadian battle.

The remains of the soldier buried there were exhumed on the morning of May 16, 2000, and the coffin was flown in a [[Canadian Forces]] aircraft to Ottawa on May 25, accompanied by a 45-person [[guard of honour]], a chaplain, Royal Canadian Legion veterans, and two representatives of Canadian youth.&lt;ref name=DVATomb /&gt; In Ottawa, the unknown soldier [[Lying in state|lay in state]] for three days in the Hall of Honour in the [[Centre Block]] on [[Parliament Hill]].&lt;ref name=DVATomb /&gt;

On the afternoon of May 28, the body of the unknown soldier was transported to the National War Memorial on a horse-drawn [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) gun carriage. [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]], [[John Ralston Saul|her husband]], and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]], as well as veterans, Canadian Forces personnel, and members of the RCMP were in the funeral cortege. Then, with [[Military funeral#Canada|full military honours]] before a crowd of 20,000,&lt;ref name=Legion /&gt; the body, in a [[silver maple]] casket,&lt;ref name=Legion /&gt; was re-interred in a sarcophagus in front of the war memorial.&lt;ref name=DVATomb /&gt; Legionnaires placed a handful of soil from each of Canada's provinces and territories, as well as from the soldier's former grave site, on the casket before the tomb was sealed.&lt;ref name=Legion /&gt;

==Tomb==
[[Image:Unknown Soldier.jpg|thumb|right|The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier seen from above, the steps of the war memorial behind]]
The tomb is intended to honour the approximately 116,000 Canadians who died in combat, as well as all members of the [[Canadian Forces|Canadian Armed Forces]]—in all branches—who died or may die in all conflicts, past, present, and future.&lt;ref name=DVAIntro /&gt; It is 3.5 metres (12&amp;nbsp;ft) long, 2.5 metres (8&amp;nbsp;ft) wide, and 1 metre (3&amp;nbsp;ft) high and built of Caledonia granite, originally quarried in [[Rivière-à-Pierre, Quebec]], with a bronze relief sculpture and four bronze corner pieces.&lt;ref name=DVADesign&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/memorials/canada/tomb-unknown-soldier/thetomb/tombconstruct| author=Department of Veterans Affairs| title=Design and Constructing| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=November 6, 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107020749/http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/memorials/canada/tomb-unknown-soldier/thetomb/tombconstruct#| archive-date=2014-11-07| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The granite was selected for its colour—matching that of the war memorial. The bronze work—showing a medieval sword, a First World War helmet, and branches of maple and laurel leaves (symbolising both victory and death)&lt;ref name=DVADesign /&gt;—was designed by Canadian artist [[Mary-Ann Liu]] and cast in [[Roberts Creek, British Columbia]]. Three of the corner pieces show the different variants of the [[Memorial Cross]] during the reigns of three [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarchs]] since the cross' inception—[[George V]], [[George VI]], and [[Elizabeth II]]—while the fourth is a [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]].&lt;ref name=DVADesign /&gt; The design, chosen by committee from six submissions by Canadian artists, reflects some of the themes and style of the [[Canadian National Vimy Memorial|Vimy Memorial]],&lt;ref name=DVADesign /&gt; designed by [[Walter Seymour Allward]]. The site is maintained by [[Public Works and Government Services Canada]].&lt;ref name=DVADesign /&gt;
[[Image:Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with poppies.jpg|thumb|left|Poppies placed on the tomb on [[Remembrance Day#Canada|Remembrance Day]]]]

The tomb has become a focal point at all commemorative events at the National War Memorial.&lt;ref name=DVATomb /&gt; At the first [[Remembrance Day#Canada|Remembrance Day]] following the tomb's installation, what became a tradition started spontaneously as attendees placed their [[corn poppy|poppies]] on the tomb. This act expanded to include the leaving of cut flowers, photographs, or letters to the deceased. The spontaneous display of respect has also carried over to [[Canada Day]], when the public leaves small, paper [[Flag of Canada|national flags]] on the tomb.

The [[Royal Canadian Legion]] commissioned in 2001 a small work of art on the theme of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier by [[André Gauthier (sculptor)|André Gauthier]].

==Sentries==
[[Image:War Memorial Guard Ottawa.jpg|thumb|right|Ceremonial guard marches by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]]
Since 2007, a pair of sentries from the [[Ceremonial Guard]], in full dress uniform and with unloaded weapons, have been stationed at the tomb, on rotation from 9 am to 5 pm. Originally, the programme ran only through July and August. This was expanded in 2014 to run from April 9 (the date of the start of the Battle of Vimy Ridge) to November 10, as well as during significant military anniversaries throughout the rest of the year.&lt;ref name=SentryProg&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do;jsessionid=850afb86ac4271793be9399cd247e9031cd426b6dcb7cf3529bc6b64269c6481.e38RbhaLb3qNe38Lb3v0?mthd=tp&amp;crtr.page=98&amp;nid=872749&amp;crtr.tp1D=1| author=Government of Canada| title=National Sentry Program launched at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each morning, the first sentries are marched out with a duty [[Bagpipes|piper]] and, upon taking their posts, are read their orders by the posting non-commissioned member: both are ordered arms and to stand at ease, weapon thrust out to the full extent of the right arm, head up, and feet 30 inches apart.&lt;ref name=RCR&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.royalmontrealregiment.com/rmr-soldiers-help-guard-ottawas-tomb-of-the-unknown-soldier/| last=Bourdon| first=Buzz| title=RMR Soldiers Help Guard Ottawa's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier| publisher=Royal Montreal Regiment| accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sentries hold their post for one hour before being replaced, though, a sentry may stand for two shifts in a day. Sentries on duty may march their [[Patrol|beat]], which consists of the senior sentry giving a sharp tap on the ground with his or her rifle butt, then acknowledged by the other sentry with a tap of his or her own rifle. A two-three pause between each movement, both sentries then come to attention, take a pace forward, shoulder their rifles, turn outwards, and start marching their beat of nine paces. At the ninth pace, both execute an about-turn and return to their original position, if a halt is signalled. Marching the beat can continue for the full hour, if desired. Sentries may not interact with the public.&lt;ref name=RCR /&gt;

As the Ceremonial Guard is drawn from all branches of the Canadian Forces (the units chosen via an established rotation&lt;ref name=Gazette&gt;{{cite news| url=http://montrealgazette.com/news/national/1025-city-military| last=Muise| first=Monique| title=Serving as War Memorial sentry in Ottawa 'such an honour'| date=October 24, 2014| newspaper=Montreal Gazette| accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the sentries, too, can be members of the [[Canadian Army]], [[Royal Canadian Navy]], or [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], as well as the [[Canadian Special Operations Forces Command|Special Operations Command]].&lt;ref name=SentryProg /&gt; The commanding officer of each unit decides who will be sent to Ottawa.&lt;ref name=Gazette /&gt; Occasionally, members of a police force will act as sentries at the tomb, such as when officers from the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] did so on July 5, 2013, to honour Sergeant [[Arthur Herbert Lindsay Richardson|Arthur Richardson]], a member of the North-West Mounted Police, who earned the [[Victoria Cross]] serving with Lord Strathcona's Horse during the [[Second Boer War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/news-nouvelles/2013/07-04-tomb-eng.htm| author=Royal Canadian Mounted Police| title=Ceremonial Guard of the Canadian Armed Forces Invite RCMP to Stand Sentry at Tomb of the Unknown Soldier| date=July 4, 2013| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
{{Main|2014 shootings at Parliament Hill, Ottawa}}
The Royal Canadian Legion leadership opined that the tomb deserved a military or police guard as a symbol of respect and to protect it from vandalism and desecration. These demands were brought into focus on the night of July 1, 2006, when Dr. Michael Pilon, a retired Canadian Forces major, photographed three young men urinating on the war memorial shortly after the annual Canada Day fireworks show over nearby Parliament Hill. In the summer of 2007, the sentry programme was instituted.

On October 22, 2014, a gunman armed with a rifle shot at the sentries on duty at the tomb, fatally wounding Corporal [[2014 shootings at Parliament Hill, Ottawa#Casualties|Nathan Cirillo]] of [[The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)]], before proceeding across the street and into the [[Centre Block]] on nearby [[Parliament Hill]]. There, the gunman was killed in a firefight by then Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Commons, [[Kevin Vickers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/gunman-in-ottawa-attack-identified-as-michael-zehaf-bibeau-1.2065443| last=Puzic| first=Sonja| title='Canada will never be intimidated,' Harper says after shootings in Ottawwa| date=October 22, 2014| publisher=CTV News| accessdate=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Centenary Theatre Company''' is a [[theatre company]] based in [[Warrington]], [[Cheshire]]. They are one of the longest established theatre companies in North West of England. The name of the Company has changed several times over the years, with the original company being established in 1901.

Centenary perform four productions each performance season including [[Musical theatre|musicals]] and [[play (theatre)|plays]]. The company also performs concerts in aid of local charities.

Centenary Theatre Company is a [[registered charity]] in the U.K.

Membership to the company is not based on artistic ability. Only if members wish to perform in productions is any [[audition]] required. Centenary is also affiliated to the [[National Operatic and Dramatic Association]] (NODA). The group performs at [[The Brindley]] in [[Runcorn]].

==History of Centenary==

The origins of the Company can be traced back to 1901 and the forming of a ladies' choral society, which was augmented by a drama group in 1904.  By 1907 the Operatic and Dramatic Society took the form seen today, with the Crosfield family taking a very active part.  The Society’s first full-scale musical was in 1907 with the presentation of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Trial by Jury]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Western,'' A Brief History of Centenary''&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier choral and dramatic productions were performed in the then newly built Crosfield Assembly Hall, which now forms part of the ground floor of the Crosfield General Office Building. In later years, musical shows were transferred to the [[Parr Hall]], and then on to the Royal Court Theatre, now lost with its site being occupied today by the Warrington Information Offices.  Crosfields celebrated their 100 years of [[soap]] making (1815–1915), and marked this several years later by building the Centenary Theatre.  The Society’s first production, in the main body of the hall (the stage had not been built yet!), was ''[[The Princess of Kensington]]''.  One year later in 1925, came the first full stage production in the theatre, ''The Geisha Girl''.

The Company's activities were suspended for World War II, as indeed it had been for World War I.  Prior to 1940 the musical productions had consisted primarily of one, two or three main scenes incorporating a large chorus that remained on stage for up to 75% of the time.  In the late 1940s a change came about with the arrival of bigger, more glamorous, and ever costlier shows – demanding more efficient detail and stage effects.

One such show was ''[[The Desert Song]]'', performed by the Society in 1947, which proved to be one of the group's greater successes, particularly in terms of attendance figures, playing to full houses – including the Saturday afternoon matinée.

During this period [[amateur theatre]] in general was booming and continued to do so for many years.  The Company flourished and was able to support various charities with donations amounting to many thousands of pounds.

The company has now completed in excess of 130 musical shows since the first one back in those early days of 1907 – with two shows every year from 1961 onwards.  They also produce two plays each year and these have included a wide variety of plays including classic drama; [[farce]]; [[comedy]] and ‘[[whodunit]]s’.

In 1984 the Society changed its name from 'Crosfields' to 'Centenary Operatic and Dramatic Society' – named after the theatre where all productions were then staged.  The Centenary Theatre closed in 1991.  The last musical there was ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' and the last play was ''[[Hindle Wakes (play)|Hindle Wakes]]''.  Later on that year the group returned to the Parr Hall – after decades away – with ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]''.

In 2005 Centenary moved again to a new purpose built theatre - Runcorn's Brindley Theatre.  To coincide with the move to a professional venue, Centenary Operatic and Dramatic Society changed its name to Centenary Theatre Company.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The '''Chase Vault''' is a [[burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]] in the cemetery of the [[Christ Church Parish Church]] in [[Oistins]], [[Christ Church Parish, Barbados|Christ Church]], [[Barbados]], best known for a widespread legend of "mysterious moving [[coffin]]s". According to the story, each time the heavily sealed vault was opened in the early 19th century for burial of a family member, all of the lead coffins had changed position. The facts of the story are unverified, and skeptics call the tale "historically dubious".&lt;ref name=Skeptoid&gt;{{Skeptoid | id=4399 | number= 399| title=The Moving Coffins of Barbados|date=2014-01-28|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The story==
The first published version of the story appeared in 1833 in [[James Edward Alexander]]'s ''Transatlantic Sketches''. According to Alexander, a Mrs. Goddard was buried in the vault in 1807, followed in 1808 by Ann Maria Chase, and in 1812 by Dorcas Chase. When the vault was opened in late 1812 for the burial of Thomas Chase, the caskets of the Chase girls were said to be found "in a confused state, having been apparently tossed from their places." Alexander wrote that when the vault was later opened "to receive the body of another infant, the four coffins, all of lead, all very heavy, were much disturbed" and that similar disturbances were found when opening the vault for burials in 1816 and 1819:&lt;ref name="Alexander1833"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir James Edward Alexander|title=Transatlantic sketches, comprising visits to the most interesting scenes in North and South America, and the West Indies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t74NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA162|accessdate=24 July 2012|year=1833|publisher=R. Bentley|pages=162–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Each time that the vault was opened the coffins were replaced in their proper situations, that is, three on the ground side by side, and the others laid on them. The vault was then regularly closed; the door (a massive stone which required six or seven men to move) was cemented by masons; and though the floor was of sand there were no marks of footsteps or water. The last time the vault was opened was in 1819. [[Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere|Lord Combermere]] was then present, and the coffins were found confusedly thrown about the vault, some with their heads down and others up. What could have occasioned this phenomenon? In no other vault in the island has this ever occurred. Was it an earthquake which occasioned it, or the effects of an inundation in the vault?}}

Different versions of the story appeared over the years, with other accounts published in 1844 and 1860.&lt;ref name="Clark1999" /&gt;

==The origins==
According to author [[Jerome Clark]], the story of the Chase Vault appears to originate from anecdotes told by Thomas H. Orderson, Rector of Christ Church during the 1800s. Orderson gave "conflicting accounts" of the tale, each containing variations. Clark says the story was subsequently repeated in Alexander's 1833 ''Transatlantic Sketches,'' and further repeated the same year in the "Anecdote Gallery" section of [[Reuben Percy]]'s ''The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.''&lt;ref name="Percy1833"&gt;{{cite book|author=Reuben Percy|title=The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7boRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA51|accessdate=14 May 2012|year=1833|publisher=J. Limbird|pages=51–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark1999"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark says that most stories that proliferated about the Chase Vault referred back to sources that could be traced to one of Orderson's accounts, and that folklorist [[Andrew Lang]] identified the differing versions told by Orderson in a December 1907 article published in ''[[The Folklore Society#Publications|Folk-Lore Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TkgKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP15&amp;dq=December+1907+issue+of+Folklore&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W1DZUtiBDcWTyQHJiIGwDA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=December%201907%20issue%20of%20Folklore&amp;f=false A Lang "Death's Deeds A bi-located Story" Folk Lore December 1907 pp. 376–90]]&lt;/ref&gt; After combing through existing documentation to determine the veracity of the Chase Vault stories, Lang reported that he could find nothing to substantiate them, either in the burial register of Christ Church or in contemporary [[List of newspapers in Barbados|newspapers]] on Barbados, aside from an "unpublished firsthand account" by a Nathan Lucas, who claimed to be present at the opening of the vault in April 1820.&lt;ref name="Clark1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerome Clark|title=Unexplained!: Strange Sightings, Incredible Occurrences &amp; Puzzling Physical Phenomena|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szFLs6pQmsQC&amp;pg=PA573|accessdate=14 May 2012|year=1999|publisher=Visible Ink Press|isbn=978-1-57859-070-4|pages=573–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Masonic allegory==
[[Skepticism|Skeptical]] investigator [[Joe Nickell]] said that stories about the Chase Vault were often repeated, but he called them "historically dubious."&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, Joe; 1982. "Barbados' restless coffins laid to rest." ''[[Fate Magazine|Fate]],'' Part I, 35.4 (April): 50–56; Part II, 35.5 (May): 79–86&lt;/ref&gt; Nickell, who had investigated an earlier alleged Masonic hoax involving a tale of buried treasure at [[Oak Island]], contended that the Barbados story was fashioned around the Masonic allegory of a "secret vault" which, according to a Masonic text, "was ... in the ancient mysteries, symbolic of death, where alone Divine Truth is to be found." Nickell wrote that two of the men named in the Chase Vault story were [[Freemasonry|members of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons]], and that a similar tale of "restless coffins" was circulated in 1943 that specifically included a party of Freemasons and a vault containing the founder of Freemasonry in Barbados.&lt;ref name="Nickell2001"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Nickell noted that Chase Vault stories were loaded with symbols and phrases which [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] would have recognized.&lt;ref name="Nickell2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joe Nickell|title=Real-Life X-Files: Investigating the Paranormal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Bm-EjjG3AwC|accessdate=14 May 2012|date=24 October 2001|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-2210-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Der_junge_Richard_Strauss.JPG|thumb|Richard Strauss in 1888]]
'''''Death and Transfiguration''''' ('''''{{Lang|de|Tod und Verklärung}}'''''), [[Opus number|Op.]] 24, is a [[tone poem]] for large orchestra by [[Richard Strauss]]. Strauss began composition in the late summer of 1888 and completed the work on 18 November 1889. The work is dedicated to the composer's friend Friedrich Rosch.

The music depicts the death of an artist. At Strauss's request, this was described in a poem by the composer's friend [[Alexander Ritter]] as an interpretation of Death and Transfiguration, after it was composed.&lt;ref&gt;Gilliam, ''Grove''&lt;/ref&gt; As the man lies dying, thoughts of his life pass through his head: his childhood innocence, the struggles of his manhood, the attainment of his worldly goals; and at the end, he receives the longed-for transfiguration "from the infinite reaches of heaven".

==Performance history==
Strauss conducted the premiere on 21 June 1890 at the [[Eisenach]] Festival (on the same program with the premiere of his ''[[Burleske|Burleske in D minor]]'' for piano and orchestra). He also conducted this work for his first appearance in England, at the Wagner Concert with the Philharmonic Society on 15 June 1897 at the [[Queen's Hall]] in London.

==Critical reaction==
English music critic [[Ernest Newman]] described this as music to which one would not want to die or awaken. "It is too spectacular, too brilliantly lit, too full of pageantry of a crowd; whereas this is a journey one must make very quietly, and alone".

French critic [[Romain Rolland]] in his ''Musiciens d'aujourd'hui'' (1908) called the piece "one of the most moving works of Strauss, and that which is constructed with the noblest utility".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Mason, Daniel Gregory (1918), ''Contemporary Composers'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
There are four parts (with Ritter's poetic thoughts condensed):

{{ordered list|type=upper-roman
| Largo (The sick man, near death)
| Allegro molto agitato (The battle between life and death offers no respite to the man)
| Meno mosso (The dying man's life passes before him)
| Moderato (The sought-after transfiguration)
}}
A typical performance lasts about 25 minutes.

&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; \relative c { \clef bass \key ees \major \time 4/4 r4^"Transfiguration theme" f,-. bes( c | d d' c2) } &lt;/score&gt;

== Instrumentation ==
The work is scored for a large orchestra: 3 [[western concert flute|flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]], 2 [[clarinet]]s in [[soprano clarinet|B-flat]], [[bass clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horn]]s in F, 3 [[trumpet]]s in F and C, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[tam-tam]], and [[string section|strings]]: 2 [[harp]]s, [[violin]]s i, ii, [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s, [[double bass]]es.

==Quoted==
In one of Strauss's last compositions, "Im Abendrot" from the ''[[Four Last Songs]]'', Strauss poignantly quotes the "transfiguration theme" from his tone poem of 60 years earlier, during and after the soprano's final line, "Ist dies etwa der Tod?" (Is this perhaps death?).
&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; { \new PianoStaff &lt;&lt; \new Staff \relative c { \clef bass \key ees \major \time 4/4 \partial 2*1 s2 | r4 a( d2~ | d4 e fis fis') | s1 | s1 | s1 | s1 } \new Staff \relative c' { \clef treble \key ees \major \time 4/4 fis2 | fis r | r a | a r | r bes | ces1~ | ces2 } \addlyrics { ist dies et- wa der Tod? } &gt;&gt; } &lt;/score&gt;
Just before his own death, he remarked that his music was absolutely correct; his feelings mirrored those of the artist depicted within; Strauss said to his daughter-in-law as he lay on his deathbed in 1949: "It's a funny thing, Alice, dying is just the way I composed it in ''Tod und Verklärung''."&lt;ref&gt;Derrick Puffett's comments on DG disc 447 762-2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''En Garde Arts''' is a New York City-based theatre company, and a pioneer in the field of [[immersive theater]].  

Founded in 1985 by [[Anne Hamburger]], the company was New York’s first exclusively site-specific theatre, leading audiences to unexpected locations across the city for innovative, contemporary, highly visual new work.  En Garde’s productions earned 6 [[OBIEs]], 2 [[Drama Desk Awards]] and the Special [[Outer Critics Circle Award]].  The company ceased operations in 1999 when Hamburger relocated to the West Coast, first as Artistic Director of the [[La Jolla Playhouse]], and later to run a global division for the [[Walt Disney Company]].   She returned to the east coast, reformed the company, and re-launched En Garde in the fall of 2014.

==En Garde Arts in the 80s and 90s==
From 1985-1999, Hamburger commissioned playwrights, directors and composers to create theatrical pieces for architectural sites and neighborhoods. The roster of En Garde’s alumni artists includes playwrights [[Charles L. Mee]], [[Mac Wellman]], [[Maria Irene Fornes]]; composers [[David Van Tieghem]], [[Jonathan Larson]]; directors [[Michael Engler]], [[Tina Landau]], [[Anne Bogart]], [[Reza Abdoh]], [[Jim Simpson (director)|Jim Simpson]] and [[Bill Rauch]]; and actors [[Carl Hancock Rux]], [[Fiona Shaw]], [[Fisher Stevens]], Tyne Daly and [[Jefferson Mays]]. Intrepid audiences followed their work to a variety of locations, including [[Central Park]], the [[Meatpacking District]],  [[Penn Yards]], [[East River Park]], Pier 25, the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]], the Victory Theater ([[New Victory Theatre]], and the intersection of Wall and Broad Streets in Lower Manhattan.

In 1989, En Garde produced a series of three plays at the Dairy, [[Belvedere Castle]] and [[Bow Bridge(Central Park)]] in Central Park to great critical acclaim.  OBIE Awards for Best New American Play and Best Director were given to BAD PENNY playwright [[Mac Wellman]] and director [[Jim Simpson (director)|Jim Simpson]] .  ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, “Moving environmentally through the streets and buildings of Manhattan, En Garde Arts is an invigorating urban presence.”  The following year, Wellman’s play CROWBAR became the first legitimate theatrical production to be held in 42nd Street’s Victory Theatre for 60 years.  Designed and built for [[Oscar Hammerstein I|Oscar Hammerstein]] in 1900, the theatre’s elaborately decorated interior remained intact despite decades of neglect, including 20 years as porn theatre.  CROWBAR was produced before 42nd Street’s redevelopment, and En Garde Arts could not find a cleaning company willing to take on the job, so a group of volunteers cleaned the interior to make way for Mac Wellman’s new play.  Directed by Richard Caliban with music by David Van Tieghem, CROWBAR won OBIEs for En Garde Arts and actor [[Elzbieta Czyzewska]], and was granted a Special Award by the Outer Critics Circle.

Now firmly in league with New York’s most influential and innovative theatre companies, En Garde continued to produce iconoclastic, critically acclaimed, award-winning work throughout the 1990s.  Reza Abdoh &amp; Mira-Lani Oglesby’s spectacular, AIDS era cri de coeur, FATHER WAS A PECULIAR MAN took place over 9 distinct locations through the Meatpacking District, long before its gentrification.   [[File:Wall street (4).jpg|thumb|J.P. Morgan Saves the Nation 1995]]  In an abandoned Victorian hospital on West 106th Street, Charles L. Mee’s ANOTHER PERSON IS A FOREIGN COUNTRY confronted the social marginalization of unconventional people; in fact, it was a celebration of difference, played like a beautiful human symphony under a blanket of stars. Director Anne Bogart’s cast included a blind choir with seeing-eye dogs, a group of emotionally disturbed rock musicians, and a man and woman, both 3’ tall, all staged against the gothic, empty Towers Nursing Home([[New York Cancer Hospital]]).  The evening ended with a stunning waterfall cascading down the building’s stone facade.

En Garde would win further OBIE Awards for Tina Landau &amp; Charles L. Mee’s  ORESTES in the Penn Yards, and Trojan Women in East River Park Amphitheatre. Deborah Warner’s adaptation of The Wasteland with Fiona Shaw earned two Drama Desk Awards.  Hamburger used the [[New York Stock Exchange]] as a backdrop for JP MORGAN SAVES THE NATION by composer [[Jonathan Larson]].  On opening night, he slipped her a cassette tape of the work he was just developing; it would become the musical phenomenon [[RENT]]. Hamburger was recognized with the Edwin Booth and Lee Reynolds Awards for the impressive body of her work.  In 1999, she was offered and accepted the post of Artistic Director with the La Jolla Playhouse.  Within six months of moving to California, she received an offer to establish a new creative division for the Walt Disney Company, where she remained until returning to New York.

==Re-launch==
Hamburger re-launched En Garde Arts in 2014 with [[BASETRACK Live]], a gripping, multimedia fusion of music, film, photojournalism and performance, that explores the impact of war on veterans and their families.   The show was developed in collaboration with the corpsmen and families of the 1st Battalion 8th Marines. BASETRACK Live, created by Edward Bilous, music direction by Michelle DiBucci, directed by Seth Bockley, co-adapted by Jason Grote with Seth Bockley and Anne Hamburger.  Music Co-Composed by Edward Bilous, Michelle DiBucci and Greg Kalember. Anne Hamburger, Executive Producer,  Portia Kamons, Producer  (Inspired by the website One-Eight Basetrack, a citizen journalism project featuring the work of Teru Kuwayama, Balazs Gardi and Tivadar Domaniczky). The production premiered in Austin, TX in September 2014, and is touring to over 40 cities nationally with a New York premiere at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] on [[Veterans Day]] 2014.  BASETRACK Live was invited to Fort Hood at the invitation of the Commanding General to encourage active duty soldiers to avail themselves of mental health services.   Six months of research by the Intrepid Behavioral Health Center determined that 36% of the soldiers that came to the show sought out help for the first time.

==BOSSS==
En Garde Arts continued to grow, creating the highly anticipated Emerging Arts Festival BOSSS (Big Outdoor Site Specific Stuff) in the fall of 2015. Beginning in early 2015, Hamburger gathered multiple artists together once a week to brainstorm ideas. Hamburger mentored the artists as pieces began to take shape, working with the Hudson River Park as a performance space. Completely free to the public, the festival featured 9 site-specific shows, including a feminist march through the park, to a first date with Bina48, the most advanced artificial intelligence-enabled robot in the world. After complications due to tropical storm Joaquin, the festival was moved from its original dates in early October to the weekend of October 23rd.
En Garde Arts plans to make BOSSS an annual event.

The '''Flag of the [[United States of the Ionian Islands]]''' was used between 1815 and 1864. The flag consisted of a British [[blue ensign]] with the coat of arms of the predecessor state, the [[Septinsular Republic]] on it with a red border.

== History ==
The United States of the Ionian Islands were created as a result of the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1815 at the [[Congress of Vienna]] as an [[Protectorate#Amical protection|amical protectorate]] under the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdlm.revues.org/6770 |title=Shipping and Trade in a British semi-colony : the Case of the United States of the Ionian Islands (1815–1864) |publisher=Cdlm.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In article 1 of section VI in the treaty, it stated that the new United States of the Ionian Islands' national flag would be the flag of the Septinsular Republic, a [[Lion of Saint Mark]] holding a Bible on a blue background, with a [[Union Jack]] in [[Canton (heraldry)|the upper corner closest to the flagstaff]] to symbolise the British protectorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Robert Montgomery | last =Martin |title =Statistics of the Colonies of the British Empire: From the Official Records of the Colonial Office| publisher = W.H. Allen &amp; Co. | edition =   | year = 1839 | isbn = |page=269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maritime usage ==

During shipping in the [[Black Sea]] and the Eastern [[Mediterranean]], the flag of the United States of the Ionian Islands would often be used as a [[flag of convenience]] by Greek ships to purport that they enjoyed the protection of the [[British Empire]]. The British ambassador to the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Percy Smythe, 6th Viscount Strangford]], was annoyed by this and  wrote to his opposite number stating that "The subjects of the Ionian States must be taught that their flag is too respectable to be converted into a mere matter of occasional convenience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Gerlina | last =Harlaftis |title =A History of Greek-Owned Shipping: The Making of an International Tramp Fleet, 1830 to the Present Day| publisher = Routledge | edition =   | year = 2005 | isbn =113499012X |page=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Crimean War]], ships flying the Ionian Islands flag were presumed to not be allowed to trade with Russia. However the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] from the [[Admiralty court]] in 1855 held that as [[Queen Victoria]] had negotiated treaties with other nations specifically including the United States of the Ionian Islands separately, instead of the implied inclusion with the [[Crown Colonies]] through mentioning just the United Kingdom alone, the Ionian Islands were not technically at war with the [[Russian Empire]] as the United Kingdom had not separately declared war on their behalf by mentioning them in the original declaration. However the judgement also stated that ships flying the Ionian flag were not British and that the citizens were not [[British subject]]s as the United States of the Ionian Islands were a protectorate and not a colony. Therefore, Ionian flagged ships were entitled to trade with Russia during the Crimean War, while British ships were not, but they did not enjoy the rights and protection of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Thomas | last =Spinks |title =Reports of Cases Decided During the Present War in the Admiralty Prize Court and the Court of Appeal, Volumes 1–2| publisher = Oxford University | edition =   | year = 1856 | isbn = |pages=193–208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disestablishment ==

In 1864, pursuant to the [[Treaty of London (1864)|Treaty of London]] the United Kingdom ceded the United States of the Ionian Islands to the [[Kingdom of Greece]] as a gesture of goodwill following [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred]] declining to accept the Greek throne despite [[Greek head of state referendum, 1862|Greek popular request]]. Upon the annexation of the Ionian Islands, the flag of the United States ceased to have official status and was replaced by the [[flag of Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Stefanos | last =Xenos |title =East and West, a Diplomatic History of the Annexation of the Ionian Islands to the Kingdom of Greece| publisher = Trübner &amp; Company | edition =   | year = 1865 | isbn = |pages=40–41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Antoine Watteau - L'imbarco per Citera.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Antoine Watteau, ''[[Embarkation for Cythera]]'', 1717]]
'''''Fête galante''''' ({{IPA-fr|fɛːt ɡalɑ̃t}}) (courtship party) is a term referring to a category of painting specially created by the French Academy in 1717 to describe [[Antoine Watteau|Antoine Watteau's]] (1684–1721) variations on the theme of the [[fête champêtre]] which featured figures in ball dress or masquerade costumes disporting themselves amorously in parkland settings. When Watteau applied to join the French academy in 1717, there was no suitable category for his works, so the academy simply created one rather than reject his application.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Fred, S. (Ed.) (2011) ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages: A global history''.  Enhanced 13th edn. Boston: Wadsworth, p. 755. {{ISBN|978-0-495-79986-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oxf&gt;Clarke, M. &amp; D. (2010) "fête galante" in ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms''. oxfordreference.com, [[Oxford University Press]]. Retrieved 8 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/fte-galante Fête Galante] ''Glossary'', [[National Gallery]], 2013. Retrieved 8 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation by Watteau==
Watteau specifically created the ''fête galante'' painting style as a compromise between two drives.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}  On the one hand, most of his funding came from private individuals, rather than from the government.  On the other hand, Watteau wanted recognition from the government-appointed [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]]. The Académie ranked scenes of everyday life and portraits, the paintings most desired by private patrons, as lower than morally educational paintings illustrating history and [[mythology]]. By portraying his patrons in scenes reminiscent of the mythologized land of [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]], where humans had supposedly lived in leisurely harmony with nature, Watteau was able to get his paintings the highest ranking at the Académie and still flatter his buyers.{{citation required|date=November 2013}}&lt;!--this menial motivation of Watteau's art seems like original research.--&gt; 

==Wider context==
After the death of [[Louis XIV]] in 1715, the aristocrats of the French court abandoned the grandeur of Versailles for the more intimate townhouses of Paris where, elegantly attired, they could play and flirt and put on scenes from the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]].{{citation required|date=November 2013}}

''Fête galante'' paintings are an important part of the [[rococo]] period of art, which saw the focus of European arts move away from the hierarchical, standardized grandeur of the church and [[royal court]] and toward an appreciation for intimacy and personal pleasures.  Nonetheless, the lush, outdoor settings of fête galante paintings were often mined from earlier paintings, especially from Venetian paintings of the 16th century and Dutch paintings of the 17th century.

==Examples==
* ''[[L'Accord Parfait]]'' - painted by Watteau between 1717 and 1718.  A lovely young woman holds music for a homely old man playing a [[flute]].
* ''[[Le Collation]]'' - by Pater.  Gentry flirt and pick flowers before a female nude reclining on a mound shaped like a sea shell.  The nude probably represents the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].
* ''[[Danse dans le Parc]]'' - by Lancret.  Lavishly dressed courtiers dance before the statue of an heroic male nude. Male nudes were a favorite subject of history paintings, so this statue clearly is meant to elevate the dancers to "historical" status.
* ''[[Declaration of Love]]'' - painted by de Troy in 1731.  De Troy's style is much more realistic than most. This painting was purchased by [[Frederick II of Prussia]] and hung in the [[Sanssouci|Sans Souci]] palace.
* ''[[Les Deux Cousines]]'' - painted by Watteau between 1717 and 1718.  Two women in white [[satin]] gowns are offered a red cape by a gallant young man. As in other fête galante paintings, Greco-Roman statues along the lake help elevate this genre scene to [[history painting]] status.
* ''[[Gardens of the Villa d'Este at Tivoli]]'' - painted by Fragonard.  [[Classical architecture]] provides the backdrop for an outdoor meal and games.
* ''[[A Lady in a Garden Taking Coffee With Some Children]]'' - painted by Lancret about 1742. A woman seated next to a fountain in a lavish garden spoons some exotic coffee over to her children while two men- probably a husband and a servant- look on.
* ''[[Mezzetino (painting)|Mezzetino]]'' - painted by Watteau between 1718 and 1720. Not technically a fête galante, this painting shows a pathetic figure from the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]] serenading a statue.
* ''A [[Pilgrimage to Cythera]]'' - painted by Watteau in 1717. Beautifully dressed aristocrats, attended by cherubs, visit an island supposedly dedicated to the ancient love goddess [[Aphrodite|Cythera]]. This painting is often held up as the prototype of the fête galante.
* ''The Shepherds'' - painted by Watteau about 1716. This painting plays on a long tradition of aristocrats pretending to be rural shepherds, a tradition which flourished in the 18th century, most famously at the mock hamlet of [[Marie Antoinette]].
* ''[[Venetian Pleasures]]'' - painted by Watteau between 1718 and 1719.  Two dancers (the man in Arabian costume) perform for a crowd of onlookers in front of a statue of Venus. The bagpiper may be a [[self-portrait]].

'''George Wilkins''' (died 1618)&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=29418|title=Wilkins, George|last=Parr|first=Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an English [[dramatist]] and [[pamphlet]]eer best known for his probable collaboration with [[William Shakespeare]] on the play ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]''. By  profession he was an inn-keeper, but he was also apparently involved in criminal activities.

==Life==
Wilkins was an inn-keeper in Cow-Cross, London, an area that was "notorious as a haunt of whores and thieves".&lt;ref name = "wilk"&gt;Roger Warren, Gary Taylor, [[MacDonald P. Jackson|MacDonald Pairman Jackson]], ''A reconstructed text of Pericles, Prince of Tyre'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp.6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Most biographical information about him derives from his regular appearance in criminal court records for thievery and acts of violence. Many of the charges against him involved violence against women, including kicking a pregnant woman in the belly, and knocking down and stomping another woman. The latter appears in other records as a known "bawd", or keeper of prostitutes. These facts have led to the suggestion that his inn functioned as a brothel and that Wilkins was a procurer, or pimp.&lt;ref name = "wilk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Charles Nicholl, 'The gent upstairs', ''Guardian'' 20-10-2007, and his book ''The Lodger'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilkins was associated with the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], and their chief playwright [[William Shakespeare]], during the latter's last working years as a dramatist. Shakespeare and Wilkins were both witnesses in the case of ''[[Bellott v Mountjoy]]'' in 1612; in his deposition he described himself as a "victualler."

==Works==

He is first heard of as the author of a [[pamphlet]] on the ''Three Miseries of [[Barbary]]'', which dates from 1606.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, Robert (1961). “Manuscript Evidence for dates of two Short Title Catalogue books: George Wilkins’s ‘Three Miseries of Barbary’ and the third edition of Elizabeth Grymeston’s ‘Miscelanea’.” ''The Library'' s5-XVI(2):141-142&lt;/ref&gt; He then collaborated in 1607 with [[William Rowley]] and [[John Day (dramatist)|John Day]] in ''[[The Travels of the Three English Brothers]]'', a dramatisation of the real-life adventures of the [[Robert Sherley|Sherley brothers]].

In the same year Wilkins wrote ''[[The Miseries of Enforced Marriage]]''. This play is based on the story of [[Walter Calverley]], whose identity is thinly disguised under the name of "Scarborough." This man had killed his two children and had attempted to murder his wife. The play originally had a tragic ending, but as played in 1607, ended in comedy and the story stopped short before the catastrophe, perhaps because of objections raised by Mrs. Calverley's family, the Cobhams.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The crime itself is dealt with in a short play, ''[[A Yorkshire Tragedy]]'' of uncertain authorship.

==''Pericles''==
A number of studies have attributed to Wilkins a share in Shakespeare's ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'' (which does not appear in Shakespeare's ''[[First Folio]]'', but was published only in a textually corrupt [[quarto]]). This may have been collaboration, or perhaps Wilkins was the original author of ''Pericles'' and Shakespeare remodelled it, or vice versa. However it may be, Wilkins published in 1608 a novel entitled ''The Painful Adventures of Pericles, Prynce of Tyre'', described as "the true history of Pericles as it was lately presented by ... [[John Gower]]" (who serves as narrator in the play). This follows the play very closely. The editors of the 1986 Oxford Edition of Shakespeare make the assumption that Wilkins was the co-author of ''Pericles'' and draw heavily upon ''The Painful Adventures'' in their controversial reconstructed text of the play. Wilkins is thought to have contributed most of the first two acts of the play, while Shakespeare wrote the last three.

A '''grave''' is a location where a [[cadaver|dead body]] (typically that of a human, although sometimes that of an animal) is [[burial|buried]]. Graves are usually located in special areas set aside for the purpose of burial, such as graveyards or [[cemetery|cemeteries]].&lt;ref name="Tütüncüetal.2015"&gt;{{cite book |title=Hajj: Global Interactions through Pilgrimage |first=Mehmet |last=Tütüncü |editor-first1=Marjo |editor-last1=Buitelaar |editor-first2=Luitgard |editor-last2=Mols |chapter=The Uppsala Mecca Painting: A New Source for the Cultural Topography and Historiography for Mecca |pp=137–163 |isbn=978-90-8890-285-7 |location=Leiden |publisher=Sidestone Press |year=2015 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LGTTBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain details of a grave, such as the state of the body found within it and any objects found with the body, may provide information for [[archaeology|archaeologists]] about how the body may have lived before its death, including the time period in which it lived and the [[culture]] that it had been a part of.

In some [[religion]]s, it is believed that the body must be burned for the [[soul]] to survive; in others, the complete decomposition of the body is considered to be important for the rest of the soul (see [[Grief|bereavement]]).

== Description ==
The formal use of a grave involves several steps with associated terminology.
;Grave cut
The excavation that formed the grave.&lt;ref name="cul"&gt;Ghamidi (2001), [http://www.renaissance.com.pk/janisla2y2.html Customs and Behavioral Laws] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923142412/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/janisla2y2.html |date=2013-09-23 |accessdate=2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations vary from a shallow scraping, to removal of topsoil to a depth of 6 feet (1.8 metres), or more where a vault or burial chamber is to be constructed. However, most modern graves in the United States are only 4 feet deep as the casket is placed into a concrete box which prevents a sinkhole, is strong enough to be driven over, and will not float in a flood.

;Excavated soil
The material dug up when the grave is excavated. It is often piled up close to the grave for backfilling and then returned to the grave to cover it. As soil decompresses when excavated and space is occupied by the burial not all the volume of soil fits back in the hole, so often evidence is found of remaining soil.  In cemeteries this may end up as a thick layer of soil overlying the original ground surface.

;Burial or interment
The body may be placed in a coffin or other container, in a wide range of positions, by itself or in a multiple burial, with or without personal possessions of the deceased.

;[[Burial vault (tomb)|Burial vault]]
A vault is a structure built within the grave to receive the body.  It may be used to prevent crushing of the remains, allow for multiple burials such as a family vault, retrieval of remains for transfer to an [[ossuary]], or because it forms a monument.

;Grave backfill
The soil returned to the grave cut following burial.  This material may contain artifacts derived from the original excavation and prior site use, deliberately placed goods or artifacts or later material. The fill may be left level with the ground or mounded.

;Monument or marker
[[Headstone]]s are best known, but they can be supplemented by decorative edging, foot stones, posts to support items, a solid covering or other options.

== Graveyard and cemeteries ==

[[File:Mausoleum of Moses Sofer.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Interior of the Jewish memorial in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]] (with the grave of the rabbi [[Chatam Sofer]] at the left).]]
Graveyards were usually established at the same time as the building of the relevant place of worship (which can date back to the 8th to 14th centuries) and were often used by those families who could not afford to be buried inside or beneath the place of worship itself. In most cultures those who were vastly rich, had important professions, were part of the [[nobility]] or were of any other high social status were usually buried in individual crypts inside or beneath the relevant place of worship with an indication of the name of the deceased, date of death and other biographical data. In Europe this was often accompanied with a depiction of their family [[coat of arms]].

Later graveyards have been replaced by [[Cemetery|cemeteries]].

'''Josef Winterhalder''' the Younger (25 January 1743, [[Vöhrenbach]] - 17 January 1807, [[Znojmo]]) was a [[Sudeten Germans|German-Bohemian]] painter belonging to the fourth generation of painters and sculptors in the Winterhalder family. He worked in [[Bohemia]], [[Lower Austria]] and Hungary.

== Life ==
He was one of six children born to the sculptor {{ill|Johann Michael Winterhalder|de}}. After his mother's death in 1753, he and two of his siblings were sent to live in [[Olmütz]] with their uncle, Josef (now referred to as {{ill|Josef Winterhalder the Elder|de|Josef Winterhalder der Ältere}})&lt;ref name="H"&gt;[http://www.mng.hu/kiallitasok/idoszaki/barokk_eng_winter Brief biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210022340/http://www.mng.hu/kiallitasok/idoszaki/barokk_eng_winter |date=2015-02-10 }} @ the [[Hungarian National Gallery]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; who formally adopted them. He introduced his nephew to his colleagues, [[Paul Troger]] and [[Franz Anton Maulbertsch]] and he was an assistant in the latter's workhop from 1763 to 1768.&lt;ref name="H" /&gt; His first mature work in his own style is an [[apotheosis]] of [[Pope Clement I|Saint Clement]] at the parish church in [[Horní Břečkov|Oberfröschau]], completed c.1770.

After marrying and settling in Znojmo, he worked prolifically throughout the area until the early 1780s, when Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] suppressed the monasteries and ordered a reduction in the ornamentation of churches; part of a general program of religious modernization.

These actions had a serious effect on Winterhalder's livelihood, but he was able to find patronage from the [[Moravia]]n nobility, decorating several of their mansions with [[trompe l'oeil]] ornaments and the like.&lt;ref name="H" /&gt; This period includes his only portrait. In 1796, {{ill|János Szily|hu|Szily János (püspök)}}, the Bishop of [[Szombathely]], wanted murals for his cathedral. Maulbertsch was the Bishop's first choice, but he was ill (terminally so, as it turned out), so the commission went to Winterhalder.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/8362499/Znojmo_and_Its_Surroundings_Local_Center_Periphery_or_Something_Completely_Different_in_Ond%C5%99ej_Jakubec_ed._Parallel_inquiries_Art_and_visual_culture_in_early-modern_Central_Europe_Brno_2013 "Znojmo and Its Surroundings"] by Tomáš Valeš @ Academia.&lt;/ref&gt; This restored his career, to some extent. The murals were lost during World War II.

Around 1800, he wrote ''Moravian artists in Znojmo and the surroundings'', a compendium of artworks and artists (with critical commentary and biographies). He also listed his own works in the order of their importance (rating those from the period of suppression at the bottom), and mused about the course of his life.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; His last known works were in 1805, at a library belonging to the [[Premonstratensian]] Order in [[Geras, Austria|Geras]].

In 1926, while in Paris at the art gallery of [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen|Joseph Duveen]], she fell in love with the painting by [[Francisco Goya]], ''[[Manuel Osorio Manrique de Zuñiga]]'', commonly known as the "Red Boy".

==Marriage==
On July 16, 1927, she married [[Gilbert Miller]], a theatrical producer, in Paris, France. Her father had been initially against the marriage, but then changed his mind. He helped the guests celebrate with a wedding breakfast at his Paris apartment, which held his vast collection of antiques and art works.&lt;ref name=wedding/&gt; Her apartment at 550 [[Park Avenue]] in New York City was decorated by [[Billy Baldwin (decorator)|Billy Baldwin]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/social-diary/2016/hello-kitty&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
On 17 April 1980 her estate was sold at auction by [[Christie's]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eaJ0MwAACAAJ The Estate of Kathryn Bache Miller]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 the Italian Baroque painting of [[c:File:Mattia Preti - San Giovanni Battista Predicazione.jpg|''St John the Baptist Preaching'']] by [[Mattia Preti]] was purchased partially with funds from the ''Kathryn Bache Miller Fund'' for the [[Legion of Honor (museum)|Legion of Honor]] museum in California.&lt;ref name=nash&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nash|first1=Steven A.|last2=Orr|first2=Lynn Federle|title=Masterworks of European Painting in the California Palace of the Legion of Honor|date=1999|publisher=[[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]]|location=New York|isbn=1-55595-182-1|pages=58–59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9Et3Te5KqgC&amp;pg=PA58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Landscape with the Good Samaritan''''' is a [[1638 in art|1638]] oil on oak panel painting by [[Rembrandt]]. It is one of only six oil landscapes by the artist and with ''[[The Girl in a Picture Frame]]'' and ''[[The Scholar at the Lectern]]'', it is also one of only three Rembrandt paintings in Polish collections. It shows the parable of the [[Good Samaritan]] from the [[Gospel of Luke]].

It was bought at a [[Paris]] auction by [[Jean-Pierre Norblin de La Gourdaine]] and therefore passed into the Polish noblewoman [[Izabela Czartoryska]]'s collection at the [[Dom Gotycki (Puławy)|Dom Gotycki]] at [[Puławy]]. That collection was later moved to [[Krakow]] and so it was one of several painting looted by the Germans in 1939. After World War Two, thanks to research by the art historian [[Karol Estreicher (junior)|Karol Estreicher]], it was returned to Krakow and is now in the city's [[Czartoryski Museum]]. That museum and its whole collection (including ''Landscape'') were sold to the Polish state for 100 million Euros in December 2016.

[[File:Leechwell, Totnes.jpg|thumb|The Leechwell, showing its position in Leechwell Lane]]
The '''Leechwell''' is a set of three [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]s in [[Totnes]], [[Devon]], [[England]]. It was known in historical times for its supposed healing properties; this tradition continues among the town's large [[New Age]] community. The name is also applied to Leechwell Lane, which leads to the spring from three directions.

==History==

===Early history===
Towards the end of the twelfth century, a [[leper]] hospital was established on the outskirts of Totnes. It is a popular belief in the town that lepers would walk up the high-walled Leechwell Lane to St Mary's church. However this belief cannot be traced back beyond the nineteenth century, and seems unlikely as lepers were ostracised, and the hospital was Church-run and would have had its own services. One branch of the lane leads to Maudlin (derived from Magdalen) Road, the site of the hospital, which is no longer extant after closing in about 1660.

===Springs used for healing===
[[Image:Leechwell.jpg|thumb|right|Close-up of the well, showing the springs (L-R) ''Toad'', ''Long Crippler'' and ''Snake'' open at the base of the far wall, filling the three rectangular basins in the floor.]]
The springs were used by the townspeople for healing purposes, most probably for skin and eye conditions, and the troughs into which the outlets poured gained the names ''Toad'', ''Long Crippler'' and ''Snake'' (long crippler being a local word for the [[slowworm]]). Their use became so popular that the Leechwell was included in a list of sites to be minded by two town wardens in 1444.

===Modern times===
In 2003 it was discovered that an overgrown and forgotten pool behind one of the walls was in fact a rare triangular immersion pool fed by the Leechwell's waters.  This meant that the Leechwell complex was a trinity of trinities — the triple spring, the three-pronged path and triangular pool emphasising the importance of the number three in both [[Christianity]] and [[superstition]].

The triangular immersion pool, which like the Leechwell is listed, will actually become a key feature of the Leechwell Garden, a new public open space. Work on the garden will start when the current building work is completed and the set of portacabins is removed. The design and implementation of the garden will be a joint collaboration between South Hams District Council and the [http://www.leechwellgarden.org.uk Leechwell Garden Association].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisissouthdevon.co.uk/news/Public-open-space-town-century/article-1560482-detail/article.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120919075133/http://www.thisissouthdevon.co.uk/news/Public-open-space-town-century/article-1560482-detail/article.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 September 2012|title=Public open space is first in town for more than century|accessdate=30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Leechwell today==
Although the Leechwell and its walls still stand, they have no formal protection, and the walls have twice been damaged in the name of improvement - by road building in the 1960s and again during work on a car park in 2006, which reduced that part of the wall by several feet. However, the site has many vocal defenders, especially the group Design Our Space, which did much to prevent inappropriate development of that area in the mid-2000s.

The Leechwell is used as a place of worship by the local New Age community, who often decorate it with ribbons and trinkets, but without causing damage to the stonework.

In recent years it appears that the right hand spring has moved its outlet point so that it no longer pours into the trough built for it. This might be due to the new houses built on the slopes above the area.

'''''Letters of Ayn Rand''''' is a book derived from the letters of novelist and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]], and published in 1995, 13 years after her death. It was edited by Michael Berliner with the approval of Rand's estate.

==Background==
When Rand died in 1982, the materials in her estate included copies of over 2000 letters written by her between 1926 and 1981. Berliner selected "approximately 35 to 40 percent of the total" for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1995|p=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also edited the letters to remove "less interesting material", such as opening and closing statements or apologies by Rand for not writing someone sooner after they had written her.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1995|pp=xvi–xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing the letters in the context of a later controversy over the editing of Rand's published [[Journals of Ayn Rand|journals]], historian Jennifer Burns affirmed that Berliner had only omitted material rather than changed the content.&lt;ref name="burns"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right]] |last=Burns |first=Jennifer |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-532487-7 |oclc=313665028 |page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hardcover edition of ''Letters of Ayn Rand'' was published by [[E. P. Dutton|Dutton]] in 1995. A paperback edition was published by [[Plume (publishing)|Plume]] in 1997.

==Contents==
The organization of the letters is largely chronological, but specific sections are dedicated to Rand's correspondence with [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Isabel Paterson]] and [[John Hospers]]. An appendix provides a form letter that Rand sent to many fans of ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' who had written her. Rand's heir, [[Leonard Peikoff]], provides an introduction.

==Reception==
At the time of its release, about a dozen publications reviewed ''Letters of Ayn Rand'', according to the [[Ayn Rand Institute]]. The reviews were mixed.&lt;ref name="annual"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berliner |first=Michael S. |title=Ayn Rand in Review |work=Archives Annual |volume=3 |year=2000 |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/DocServer/volume3.pdf |page=23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622052015/http://www.aynrand.org/site/DocServer/volume3.pdf |archivedate=June 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', [[Christopher Cox]], then a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]], gave the book a positive review. He said Rand's letters were "an important part of Ayn Rand's intellectual contribution" that are "filled with flashes of emotional insight, surprising facts and unintended humor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cox |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Cox |title=Behind The Fountainhead |work=[[The New York Times Book Review]] |date=August 6, 1995 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first positive review of one of Rand's books in ''The New York Times Book Review'' since 1943.&lt;ref name="annual"/&gt;

Another positive review came from Rand scholar [[Chris Matthew Sciabarra]]. Writing in ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine, he predicted that Rand's letters would "delight and sometimes shock readers", and said "what is most startling about the collection is how well it humanizes Ayn Rand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sciabarra |first=Chris Matthew |authorlink=Chris Matthew Sciabarra |url=http://reason.com/archives/1995/11/01/rand-the-living |title=Rand the Living |work=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |volume=27 |issue=6 |date=November 1995 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Liberty (1987)|Liberty]]'' magazine editor [[R.W. Bradford]] found the book interesting and said it "allows the reader to see glimpses of the real woman and her development as a thinker and writer."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bradford|1995|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he described Berliner's editing as "inept"&lt;ref name="bradford54"&gt;{{harvnb|Bradford|1995|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Peikoff's introduction as "uninformative".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bradford|1995|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said Rand wrote relatively few letters for a significant literary figure, and suggested Berliner held back potentially interesting letters for fear of upsetting Rand's "self-made myth," which Bradford considered "inexcusable".&lt;ref name="bradford54"/&gt;

In ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Jeffrey Frank]] described the book as "ultimately tedious". He said her earlier letters are "considerably more interesting than the later ones", which include "an endless amount of whining about various publishers, her detailed responses to editors' suggestions, her hectoring assertions of her beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeffrey A. |last=Frank |authorlink=Jeffrey Frank |title=The Virtues of Selfishness |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=July 9, 1995 |page=WBK4 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/6855809.html?FMT=ABS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[National Review]]'', [[Florence King]] said the "book reeks of the sycophancy that Miss Rand always inspired" and noted several letters attacking the ''National Review'' itself, "the magazine she loved to hate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Florence |last=King |authorlink=Florence King |title=Scud Missives |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/king/king200405280928.asp |work=[[National Review]] |date=October 9, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] magazines praised the book, with one saying, "in her letters we learn more of the style of her soul",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Donald |last=Heath |title=Correspondence to Reality |url=http://www.objectivistcenter.org/showcontent.aspx?ct=36 |work=IOS Journal |date=September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another called the book "the next best thing" to knowing Rand personally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garmong |first=Dina |title=An Intimate View of a Titan |journal=[[The Intellectual Activist]] |date=September 1995 |volume=9 |issue=5 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review for the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', Scott Holleran called the book "a treasure chest" in which "Rand emerges as a passionate thinker".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Holleran |title=Rand's Letters Offer Glimpse of Greatness |work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |date=December 17, 1995 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-25030258.html}}{{Subscription required|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reviews included a review by [[Claudia Roth Pierpont]] in ''[[The New Yorker]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Claudia Roth |last=Pierpont |authorlink=Claudia Roth Pierpont |title=Twilight of the Goddess |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=July 24, 1995 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1995/07/24/1995_07_24_070_TNY_CARDS_000370859}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reviews in ''[[Booklist]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Winters |first=Dennis |title=Review |work=Booklist |volume=91 |date=June 1, 1995 |page=1720 |url=http://booklistonline.com/ProductInfo.aspx?pid=982841}}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Overmyer |first=J. |title=Review |work=[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]] |volume=33 |date=February 1996 |page=952}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jere |last=Real |title=Ayn Rand Stood by Principles |work=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]] |date=August 6, 1995 |page=F4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand scholars writing about the book some years later also expressed mixed opinions. [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] complimented the "uncommon variety of letters" included, saying it "allows the reader access to the many facets of Rand's private and public personae."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she noted a mistake regarding Rand's birthday at the beginning of the book, and included it among several posthumous books approved by Rand's estate that "have not always exhibited a confidence-inspiring level of academic rigor."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer Burns said scholars can use the material in the book, but indicated the material omitted by Berliner includes items "of high interest to the historian" so that "important insights can be gleaned only from the originals."&lt;ref name="burns"/&gt;

Margit Tevan was a 20th century Hungarian goldsmith. She was born on 18 January 1901 into a Jewish family and died on 3 November 1978. 

== Studies and training ==
Margit Tevan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Margit Tevan |url=http://clara.nmwa.org/index.php?g=entity_detail_print&amp;entity_id=8115 |website=http://archive.wikiwix.com |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302143305/http://clara.nmwa.org/index.php?g=entity_detail_print&amp;entity_id=8115 |archivedate=2012-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was born on 18 January 1901 in Békéscsaba (Hungary) into a Jewish family whose father was running an important editing house. She started her artistic studies at the Academy of Applied Arts in Budapest and after one year specialized with some of the most famous goldsmiths of the time: Richard Zutt and Ferenc (Francis) Kiss. Not being interested in making jewels, she later joined Arpád Vértes' workshop which was better known under the name of "Stúdió" (1927-1928). In 1927 she married the chemical engineer Miklós Engel and moved to Budapest. By creating boxes and plates, she innovates the goldsmith tradition which at the time was more interested in making vases and bowls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kenyeres|first1=Ágnes|title=Magyar életrajzi lexikon II. (L–Z)|date=1969|publisher=Akadémiai kiadó|location=Budapest|isbn=9789630524971|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/00300/00355/html/ABC15363/15653.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence and creations ==
The influence of the Bauhaus school is evident in her early work. She then continued her artistic development towards an archaic romanticism, influenced by Romanesque art and the simplicity of the motifs which she used, especially in her friezes which decorate her boxes and plates. Her many objects which she produced during her whole life are mainly hand hammered silver-leafed copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TEVAN_catalog_1981|url=https://get.google.com/albumarchive/100615662422121274676/album/AF1QipMpZV7sY9HDYWoDINEhwHV8rlVktxxyujbNEFK2?source=pwa&amp;authKey=CP3-0biL8sz9mQE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

One can find traces of references to both Jewish and Christian culture in her work. She continued her production during Communism where she kept her poetic register with smaller works that are sometimes offered as presents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jewish Budapest. Monuments, Rites, History|date=1999|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=9639116378|location=Budapest|page=179|last1=Frojimovics|first1=Kinga}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== War and persecution ==
Between 1944 and 1945, she was forced to live in the international ghetto of Budapest and obtained a safe conduct passport from the Swedish authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tevan|first1=Margit|title=Minden ház ellenségesen áll - Tevan Margit 1944/45-ös feljegyzése|date=2015|publisher=Tevan Alapítvány|location=Budapest|isbn=9789638972668|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acknowledgements and prizes ==
She participated in numerous exhibitions and received a Diplôme d'honneur for her work during the Paris World Exhibition in 1937. She also obtained a similar diploma during the 1939 New York World Fair. Finally, she won the silver medal at the VII Milan Triennale of 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.oszk.hu/02500/02510/00046/pdf/EPA02510_corvina_1940_05_340-348.pdf|title=L'Ungheria alla VII Triennale di Milano|website=epa.oszk.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Triennale di Milano|url=http://old.triennale.org/it/archivio-fotografico/esposizione/23381-viitrn?filter_catphoto=23430&amp;cat=23430&amp;filter_type=image|website=http://old.triennale.org/it}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, she won the Munkácsy Prize, the highest artistic recognition in Hungary, as well as numerous other prizes between 1971 and 1976. She died in Budapest on 3 November 1978.

== Descendants ==
Her son, Engel Tevan István, was born in 1936, worked as a well-known book illustrator, and passed away in 1996.

Ideas from '''[[Mathematics]]''' have been used as inspiration for '''[[fiber art]]s''' including [[quilt]] [[quilting|making]], [[knitting]], [[cross-stitch]], [[crochet]], [[embroidery]] and [[weaving]]. A wide range of mathematical concepts have been used as inspiration including [[topology]], [[graph theory]], [[number theory]] and [[algebra]]. Some techniques such as [[counted-thread embroidery]] are naturally [[geometry|geometrical]]; other kinds of [[textile]] provide a ready means for the colorful [[mathematics and art|physical expression of mathematical concepts]].

==Quilting==
{{main|quilt}}

The [[IEEE Spectrum]] has organized a number of competitions on [[quilt block]] design, and several books have been published on the subject. Notable quiltmakers include Diana Venters and Elaine Ellison, who have written a book on the subject ''Mathematical Quilts: No Sewing Required''. Examples of mathematical ideas used in the book as the basis of a quilt include the [[golden rectangle]], [[conic section]]s, [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s Claw, the [[Koch curve]], the [[Clifford torus]], [[San Gaku]], [[Lorenzo Mascheroni|Mascheroni]]'s [[cardioid]], [[Pythagorean triple]]s, [[spidron]]s, and the six [[trigonometric functions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Ellison | first1=Elaine | last2=Venters | first2=Diana | isbn=1-55953-317-X | publisher=Key Curriculum | title=Mathematical Quilts: No Sewing Required | year=1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knitting and crochet==
[[Image:Cross stitch embroidery.jpg|thumb|[[Cross-stitch]] [[counted-thread embroidery]]]]

Knitted mathematical objects include the [[Platonic solid]]s, [[Klein bottle]]s and [[Boy's surface]].
The [[Lorenz attractor|Lorenz manifold]] and the [[Hyperbolic manifold|hyperbolic plane]] have been crafted using crochet.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Henderson | first1 = David | last2 = Taimina | first2 = Daina | author2-link = Daina Taimina | doi = 10.1007/BF03026623 | issue = 2 | journal = [[Mathematical Intelligencer]]

==Embroidery==

[[File:Florentin.png|thumb|upright|Two [[Bargello (needlework)|Bargello patterns]]]]

Embroidery techniques such as [[counted-thread embroidery]]&lt;ref&gt;Gillow, John, and Bryan Sentance. ''World Textiles'', Little, Brown, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[cross-stitch]] and some [[canvas work]] methods such as [[Bargello (needlework)]] make use of the natural [[pixel]]s of the weave, lending themselves to geometric designs.&lt;ref&gt;Snook, Barbara. ''Florentine Embroidery''. Scribner, Second edition 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Elsa S. ''Bargello: Florentine Canvas Work''. Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weaving==

[[Ada Dietz]] (1882 &amp;ndash; 1950) was an American [[weaving|weaver]] best known for her 1949 monograph ''Algebraic Expressions in Handwoven Textiles'', which defines weaving patterns based on the expansion of multivariate [[polynomial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Dietz | first = Ada K. | location = Louisville, Kentucky
 | publisher = The Little Loomhouse | title = Algebraic Expressions in Handwoven Textiles | url = http://www.cs.arizona.edu/patterns/weaving/monographs/dak_alge.pdf | year = 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvs|first=J. C. P.|last=Miller|authorlink=J. C. P.

==Spinning==

[[Margaret Greig]] was a mathematician who articulated the mathematics of [[worsted spinning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=International Women in Science |author=Catharine M. C. Haines |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2001 |isbn=9781576070901 |page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion design==

The silk scarves from DMCK Designs' 2013 collection are all based on Douglas McKenna's [[space-filling curve]] patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space-Filling Curves|url=https://dmck.us/the-company/space-filling-curves/|publisher=DMCK|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designs are either generalized Peano curves, or based on a new space-filling construction technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=McKenna, Douglas |title=The 7 Curve, Carpets, Quilts, and Other Asymmetric, Square-Filling, Threaded Tile Designs |work=Bridges Donostia: Mathematics, Music, Art, Architecture, Culture |url=http://www.bridgesmathart.org/2007/2007-program.html |publisher=The Bridges Organization | date=24 July 2007 |accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McKenna |first1=Douglas |title=Designing Symmetric Peano Curve Tiling Patterns with Escher-esque Foreground/Background Ambiguity |work=Bridges Leeuwarden: Mathematics, Music, Art, Architecture, Culture |url=http://www.bridgesmathart.org/2008/Schedule_V9-1.pdf |publisher=The Bridges Organization |accessdate=15 May 2015|date=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Issey Miyake]] Fall-Winter 2010–2011 ready-to-wear collection featured designs from a collaboration between fashion designer Dai Fujiwara and mathematician [[William Thurston]]. The designs were inspired by Thurston's [[geometrization conjecture]], the statement that every [[3-manifold]] can be decomposed into pieces with one of eight different uniform geometries, a proof of which had been sketched in 2003 by [[Grigori Perelman]] as part of his proof of the [[Poincaré conjecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | last = Barchfield | first = Jenny | date = March 5, 2010 | publisher = [[ABC News]] | title = Fashion and Advanced Mathematics Meet at Miyake | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=10017982}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mir Ali Tabrizi''' ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|میرعلی  تبریزی}}}}) was a distinguished Iranian [[calligraphy|calligrapher]] of the 14th century, to whom the invention of  [[Nastaʿlīq script|Nas-Taliq]] calligraphy style is attributed.&lt;ref&gt;S. Brent Plate, "Religion, art, and visual culture: a cross-cultural reader", Palgrave Macmillan, 2002.  pg 93:"precision of tradition still allows for creativity, and there is a telling story of a famous Persian calligrapher, Mir Ali Tabrizi (died c. 1420 CE),"&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Soucek|1985|page=881}}

==Early life==
He lived in the 14th century.{{sfn|Soucek|1985|page=881}} Historians have not been able to unveil details of Mir Ali's life yet. It is known that he lived in [[Tabriz]] and was a poet as well as an adept calligrapher (see [[Dehkhoda Dictionary|Dehkhoda dictionary]]).

==Nas-Taliq calligraphy==
He is known as father of Nas-Taliq, the most popular style of [[Persian calligraphy]]. He was thus titled "Qodwat al-Kottab" (literally 'the chief of the scribes'). He invented this beautiful calligraphy style by means of combining two older styles together (Naskh and Taliq).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HISTORIC PERSIAN CALLIGRAPHY ARTISTS|url=http://www.persiancalligraphy.org/Famous-Calligraphers.html|work=PersianCalligraphy.org|accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nas-Taliq is a light and elegant cursive script as other types of [[Islamic calligraphy]]. In contrast to other Islamic scripts, the Nas-Taliq has characters that appear to swing from the upper right to the lower left of each word as if suspended by an imaginary line. It featured elongated horizontal strokes and exaggerated rounded forms with no serifs. The diacritical marks were casually placed, and the lines were flowing rather than straight. There is a popular myth that Mir Ali [[Mirza Jafar Tabrizi]], another well-known Persian calligrapher, was Mir Ali's pupil. Later, Mirza Jafar's students followed Mir Ali's style in Herat, where his scripts were frequently copied and highly praised.{{sfn|Soucek|1985|page=881}}

'''''Moon Museum''''' is a small [[ceramic]] [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]] three-quarters of an inch by half an inch in size,&lt;ref name="History"&gt; [https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/diyinv/2010/06/diy-moon-museum.html Who is John F.?], ''[[History Detectives]]'', [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], Season 8, Episode 1, June 7, 2010. Accessed July 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; containing artworks by six prominent artists from the late 1960s. The artists with works in the "museum" are [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[:de:David_Novros|David Novros]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Forrest Myers]] and [[Andy Warhol]].&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; 

This wafer was supposedly covertly attached to a leg of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module ''Intrepid'']], and subsequently left on the Moon during [[Apollo 12]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cory |first1=Doctorow |title=Secret museum on the moon's surface / Boing Boing |url=https://boingboing.net/2008/02/29/secret-museum-on-the.html |website=boingboing.net |accessdate=21 June 2018 |date=29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Moon Museum'' is considered the first Space Art object.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.tampamuseum.org/exhibitions/current The Moon Museum: First Space Art Object Lands at Tampa Museum of Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714020938/http://www.tampamuseum.org/exhibitions/current |date=2011-07-14 }}. [[Tampa Museum of Art]] June 18 - August 1, 2010. Accessed July 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is impossible to tell if ''Moon Museum'' is actually on the Moon without sending another mission to look, technicians have admitted to placing personal effects onto the Apollo landers, hidden in the layers of gold blankets that wrapped parts of the spacecraft which remained on the Moon after the astronauts departed.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

==History==
The concept for ''Moon Museum'' was brainstormed by Forrest "Frosty" Myers. He stated that "My idea was to get six great artists together and make a tiny little museum that would be on the moon."&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Myers attempted several times to get his project sanctioned by [[NASA]]. He claims the agency gave him the runaround and, Myers states, "They never said no, I just could not get them to say anything."&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Instead of going through the official channels, he was forced to take the back route and try to smuggle it on board.
[[File:Moon museum nyt.jpg|thumb|left|Image of the Moon Museum from the original ''New York Times'' article. The thumb obscures Warhol's drawing.]]

Myers contacted [[Experiments in Art and Technology]] (E.A.T.), a non-profit group that was linking artists with engineers to create new works. Through E.A.T., Myers was introduced to some scientists from [[Bell Laboratories]], specifically [[Fred Waldhauer]]. Using techniques normally used to produce telephone circuits, the scientists etched the drawings Myers had gathered onto small ceramic wafers. Either 16 or 20 of these wafers were created,&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; with one going on the lunar lander and the rest, copies of the original, handed out to the artists and others involved in the project.&lt;ref name="AOL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aolnews.com/weird-news/article/tiny-art-museum-hidden-aboard-apollo-12-for-its-moon-landing/19516542 |title=Warhol in Space: Apollo 12 Secretly Carried Art to the Moon |last1=Moye |first1=David |last2= |first2= |date=17 June 2010 |website=Aol News |publisher= |access-date=14 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618232925/http://www.aolnews.com/weird-news/article/tiny-art-museum-hidden-aboard-apollo-12-for-its-moon-landing/19516542|archivedate=18 June 2010|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When NASA dithered whether the wafer would be allowed onto the module, Waldhauer devised another plan. Waldhauer knew a [[Grumman Aircraft]] engineer who was working on the Apollo 12 lander module, and he proved willing to place the wafer on it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/aboutpbs/news/20100607_historydetectivesandywarholartonmoon.html PBS' HISTORY DETECTIVES PUTS A QUESTION TO THE NATION: IS ANDY WARHOL’S ART ON THE MOON?]. PBS. June 7, 2010. Accessed July 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Myers asked Waldhauer how he would know if the art actually made it onto the lander, and was told that the person who worked for Grumman would send him a [[telegram]] when the wafer was in place. At 3:35 p.m. on November 12, 1969, less than two days before Apollo 12 took off, Myers received a telegram at his house from [[Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]] stating "YOUR ON' A.O.K. ALL SYSTEMS GO," and signed "JOHN F."&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

The existence of the work was not revealed until Myers informed ''[[The New York Times]]'' which ran an article on the story two days after Apollo 12 left the Moon and two days before they splashed down in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name="greg"&gt;[http://greg.org/archive/2008/02/28/the_moon_museum.html Holy ^%$&amp;! Man Smuggles Art To The &amp;%#$ing Moon!] Greg.com. February 8, 2008. Accessed July 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six artworks located on the ceramic tile, each one in black and white. Starting in the top center is a single line by [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. To its right is a black square with thin white lines intersecting, resembling a piece of circuitry, by David Novros. Below it is  [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]]'s contribution, a template pattern which also resembles circuitry. In the lower middle is a geometric variation on [[Mickey Mouse]], by [[Claes Oldenburg]], a popular motif for the artist at that time. [[Forrest Myers]]  created the work in the lower left, a computer-generated drawing of a "linked symbol" called "Interconnection". Finally, the last drawing in the upper left is by [[Andy Warhol]]. He created a stylized version of his initials which, when viewed at certain angles, can appear as a [[rocket ship]] or a [[penis]].&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="5 July 2015"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stinson |first1=Elizabeth |title=We Sent a Dick Pic to the Moon—And We're Doing It Again |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/05/we-sent-a-dick-pic-to-the-moon/ |website=WIRED |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moma"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.moma.org/collection/works/62272 | title =The Moon Museum | publisher =[[Museum of Modern Art]] | access-date =April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "He was being the terrible bad boy," said Forrest Myers in an interview.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Warhol's work is covered by a thumb in the image often associated with ''Moon Museum'', but other images with the drawing visible can be found.&lt;ref name= "greg" /&gt;

'''''October Sky ''''' (the title on the mass market movie tie-in version of the best-selling '''''The Rocket Boys''''') is the first [[memoir]] in a series of four, by [[Homer Hickam|Homer Hickam Jr.]] It is a story of growing up in a mining town, and a boy's pursuit of [[amateur rocketry]] in a coal mining town. It won the W.D. Weatherford Award in 1998, the year of its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.berea.edu/appalachiancenter/weatherford/pastwinners.asp | title = Weatherford Award | accessdate = August 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is one of the most often picked community/library reads in the United States. It is also studied in many school systems around the world. ''October Sky'' was followed by ''[[The Coalwood Way]]'' (2000), ''[[Sky of Stone]]'' (2002), and ''[[Carrying Albert Home]]'' (2015).

''Rocket Boys'' was made into a film in 1999, titled ''[[October Sky]]'' (an [[anagram]] of "Rocket Boys"). The book was then re-published as ''October Sky'' shortly afterwards.

== Plot summary ==
Homer "Sonny" Hickam Jr. lives in a small coal mining town in [[West Virginia]] named [[Coalwood, West Virginia|Coalwood]]. Sonny, after seeing the Russian satellite [[Sputnik]], decides to join the American team of rocket engineers called the Missile Agency when he graduates from school. (Note: In the book ''Rocket Boys'', the main character is always called Sonny. In the movie ''October Sky'', he is called Homer.) Sonny's older brother, Jim Hickam, excels at football and expects to get a college football scholarship. Sonny, however, is terrible at sports and has no special skill that would get him "out of Coalwood". Sonny's mother is afraid that he will have to work in the mines after high school.	
Sonny's first attempt at rocketry (which occurred when he was 14) consists of a flashlight tube and model airplane body as a casing.  It is fueled by flash powder from old cherry bombs. It explodes violently, destroying his mother's fence. After that, Sonny enlists the help of [[Quentin Wilson (engineer)|Quentin Wilson]], [[Roy Lee Cooke]], Sherman Siers, Jimmy "O'Dell" Carroll, and Billy Rose to help build rockets while forming the BCMA ([[Big Creek Missile Agency]]). Their first real rocket, powered by [[black powder]], is named Auk 1. This an allusion to the [[great auk]], which is a flightless seabird that became [[extinction|extinct]] in the mid-19th century. Auk 1 flies six feet before the solder melts, and the nozzle, a washer, separates from the casement. They call themselves "Rocket Boys" and call the place where they are launching their rockets "Cape Coalwood", in honor of [[Cape Canaveral]].	
The Rocket Boys enjoy mixed success during their three-year rocket launching campaign (1957 to 1960). They employ several fuel mixtures including [[rocket candy]] and a mixture called "zincoshine", which is composed of zinc dust and sulfur, along with alcohol from [[moonshine]], supplied by a local [[Rum-running|bootlegger]], as a binder for the mixture. They launch a total of 35 rockets, all sequentially numbered Auk I–XXXI. (There are five different Auk XXIIs.) 	
They also win a [[Science fair|National Science Fair]] gold medal for their rockets, for their project titled "A Study of Amateur Rocketry Techniques."

== Characters ==

* '''[[Homer Hickam|Homer "Sonny" Hickam Jr.]]''' is the author and narrator of the memoir. He is 8 years old at the beginning of the story but is in high school for most of the book, and he serves as the leader of the Rocket Boys. He is nearsighted and wears glasses, and he plays in the school band.	
* '''Elsie Hickam''' is Homer Hickam's wife and the mother of Jim and "Sonny" Hickam. She has a tense relationship with her husband through most of the story. She is supportive of Sonny's rocket building, and often finds herself at odds with her husband, Homer Sr., about the rocket building. She often tells Sonny, "Don't blow yourself up." She works on a mural of [[Myrtle Beach]] throughout the memoir.	
* '''Homer Hickam Sr.''' is Elsie Hickam's husband and the father of Jim and "Sonny" Hickam. He is the hard-headed mine foreman in Coalwood. He takes his job very seriously, going out of his way to help miners in distress. He is almost always at odds with the union leader, John Dubonnet, who dated Elsie when they were all in high school together. Homer Sr. seems to not care about Sonny's affairs as much as he does Jim's; Sonny points this out in the book much to Homer Sr.'s chagrin. He has a spot on his lung that is the common miner's disease, black lung ([[Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis]]), but refuses to quit work, although most men who are discovered to have this illness are forced into retirement, but allowed to stay in Coalwood.	
* '''Jim Hickam''' is Homer Hickam Jr.'s older brother and the son of Elsie and Homer Hickam. He is a star athlete, which leads to him having several conflicts with "Sonny" over how Homer seems to favor Jim over "Sonny". He dates the girl Sonny is in love with, Dorothy Plunk, but later dumps her like he does with many of his girlfriends.	
* '''[[Quentin Wilson (engineer)|Quentin Wilson]]''' is one of the more intelligent members of the Rocket Boys, the one who does the most math. Quentin carries a suitcase stuffed with books wherever he goes and finds excuses to get out of gym class. He is excitable and often confounds the other members and townspeople with his advanced vocabulary.	
* '''Jimmy "O'Dell" Carroll''' is small and excitable, the most emotional member of the group. His father drives the town garbage truck, allowing O'Dell access to many useful items, frequently scrounged to further the group's efforts. He is always scheming of ways of making money, from the failed iron scrap attempt—which took an entire summer, yielded a net loss of one dollar, not counting the destruction of borrowed equipment and almost killing Sonny—to the profitable harvesting of [[ginseng]].	
* '''Sherman Siers''' has a weakened left leg as a result of polio, but does not let it slow him down. He is also the most observant and practical member of the team. At the age of twenty-six, Sherman died unexpectedly of a heart attack.	
* '''[[Roy Lee Cooke]]''' is Sonny's best friend. He teaches Sonny something about girls. In the follow-up memoir titled ''The Coalwood Way'', it is revealed that he is known as The Big Creek Lovemaster. Roy Lee also knows the moonshiner in town, John Eye, who provides the boys with the alcohol needed for their special propellant they call Zincoshine. On page 302, Roy Lee states that if they were successful in flying the rocket, "She wouldn't be able to get out of her panties fast enough," (referring to a cheerleader)
* '''Willie "Billy" Rose''' is a member of the Rocket Boys who joins the group about a year after it is founded. He has excellent eyesight and can find rockets very well. He is the best runner in the group.	
* '''[[Freida J. Riley|Miss Riley]]''' is a chemistry and physics teacher at Big Creek High School who inspires the Rocket Boys to compete in the National Science Fair. She gives Sonny a book called ''[[Principles of Guided Missile Design]]'' that is extremely useful to the Rocket Boys in the future. She also orchestrates the Rocket Boys' entry into the National Science Fair. She is diagnosed with [[Hodgkin's Lymphoma]] shortly before Sonny leaves for the science fair. At first her affliction goes into remission, but later she dies of her disease.	
* '''Jake Mosby''' is a womanizing alcoholic who helps the BCMA in paying off debts. Jake is a mining engineer. He also introduces them to a writer of a small newspaper, Basil Oglethorpe. He later settles down a bit and starts dating Miss Riley for a period of time, trying to be dependable for her. He is a veteran of the [[Korean War]], and compares the BCMA's rocket launches to his war experiences.	
* '''Basil Oglethorpe''' is the writer of a small newspaper called the ''[[McDowell County Banner]]''. He is in charge of the BCMA's publicity.	
* '''Mr. Ferro''' is in charge of a group of company machinists who help the BCMA build their rockets.	
* '''Mr. Caton''' is a machinist in Mr. Ferro's team. He is the main builder of the BCMA's rockets.	
* '''Dorothy Plunk''' is Sonny's dream girl; he even describes her as "God's Perfection" at one point in the memoir. While Sonny spends most of his time infatuated with her, although she still spends time with him, Dorothy only wants a friend relationship and goes out with other boys. For a large section of the book, Sonny ignores her, because she started a relationship with his brother Jim. She was also the valedictorian of Sonny's graduating high school class and got the spot Sonny wanted in a calculus class because her grades were higher.
* '''Valentine Carmina''' is an older girl who likes Sonny. Ultimately, it is implied she has sex with him in the backseat of a car on the same night Dorothy breaks his heart.  Homer later describes the event as her pity to him.	
* '''Mr. Isaac Bykovski''' is a worker in the mine who helps Sonny with his first rockets. Homer Sr. makes him work in the mine as punishment for helping Sonny. Later, Homer Sr. offers him his job back in the machine shop, but Bykovski does not accept the offer because he made more money in the mine. He is later killed in a mine collapse while operating a loader.	
* '''Geneva Eggers''' is a middle-aged woman who was rescued as a baby by Homer Hickam Sr. when her house was on fire. The rest of her family was still in the house when it went up in flames but she was the only one whom Homer Sr. saw. Everyone else in her family perished. It is implied that after the fire, she turned to prostitution in order to support herself. During the novel, she invites Sonny into her home when he almost freezes to death on a December night and gives him a new set of clothes. Sonny feels uncomfortable changing in front of her and, sensing the hesitation, she replies, "Oh, come on. You ain't gonna show me nothin' I ain't already seen too many times."
* '''Buchanan "Buck" Trant ''' is a football player who hates Sonny. He insults Sonny and even starts to tear down "[[Cape Coalwood]]."

[[File:pibiones.jpg|thumb|Pibiones fabric]]
[[File:Tessitura di Ulassai.jpg|thumb|Sardinian craftswoman]]
The '''grain''' or '''pibiones''' [[Weaving|weaving technique]] is most commonly found in the central and eastern areas of [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]]. This is a particular type of stitched relief, created from the countless grains that make up the design. These are made by twisting the [[yarn]] around a [[Sewing needle|needle]] which is arranged in a horizontal position on the [[loom]]; the needle is then pulled away, thereby creating a raised effect (grains).

These '''grains''' are fastened by the weft threads and are fixed in position by one or more strokes of the beater. ''Operated entirely by hand'', including the slay mechanism, i.e. the working phase effected by a complicated mechanism moved by the hands and feet which tightens the weft yarns one against the other once they have passed over the [[pin]].

The Pibiones technique was used in antiquity only for the best hand-woven bed covers “sa faona” and for household articles such as [[curtain]]s, [[fabrics]], cushions and tablecloths.

'''Quirky''' is an invention platform that connects inventors with companies that specialized in a specific product category.&lt;ref name="Quirky"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.quirky.com/about | work=Quirky | title=About | date=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Quirky was founded in 2009 by Ben Kaufman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/quirky-telling-world-just-how-unimportant-its-ceo-158032|title=Quirky Is Telling the World Just How Unimportant Its CEO Is|date=2014-05-30|website=AdWeek|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Quirky received $6.5 million in Series A [[venture capital]] funding, led by RRE Ventures.&lt;ref name="supply chain"&gt;[https://venturebeat.com/2010/04/27/quirky-ben-kaufman/ Quirky's 23-year-old CEO finds love with the supply chain], Paul Boutin, ''VentureBeat'', April 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The company later received a $16 million Series B round in August 2011 led by [[Norwest Venture Partners]], and a $68 million Series C round in September 2012 led by [[Andreessen Horowitz]] and [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/09/07/quirky-gets-backing-from-andreessen-horowitz-and-kleiner-perkins/ | title=Quirky Gets Backing From Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins | accessdate=October 17, 2012 | last=Fenn | first=Donna | publisher=New York Times | date=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in November 2013, Quirky raised $79 million in Series D funding from GE as well as its venture investors Andreessen Horowitz, Norwest Venture Partners, RRE, and Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://allthingsd.com/20131113/quirky-funding/|title = Quirky Raises $79M, Including $30M From GE to Make Connected-Home Gadgets|date = November 13, 2013|accessdate = |website = All Things Digital|publisher = |last = Gannes|first = Liz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the deal included a $30 million investment from [[General Electric|GE]], as well as a partnership to build 30 connected-home gadgets together in the next five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.wired.com/2013/11/how-ge-and-quirky-want-to-smarten-up-your-home/|title = Quirky and GE Partner to Conquer the Internet of Things|date = November 19, 2013|accessdate = |website = Wired|publisher = |last = Stinson|first = Liz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3211">'''The Seven and Five Society''' was an [[art group]] of seven painters and five sculptors created in 1919 and based in London.

The group was originally intended to encompass traditional, conservative artistic sensibilities. The first exhibition catalogue said, "[we] feel that there has of late been too much pioneering along too many lines in altogether too much of a hurry." Abstract artist [[Ben Nicholson]] joined in 1924, followed by others such as [[Henry Moore]] and [[Barbara Hepworth]], and changed the society into a [[modernist]]ic one and expelled the non-modernist artists. In 1935, the group was renamed the Seven and Five Abstract Group. At the [[Desmond Zwemmer|Zwemmer Gallery]] in [[Charing Cross Road]], London, they staged the first exhibition of entirely abstract works in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/s/the-seven-and-five-society "Seven and Five Society"], ''Tate''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11940">[[File:Transasia trade routes 1stC CE gr2.png|thumbnail|300px|1st century CE Map of Silk Road]]
[[File:ChineseJadePlaques.JPG|thumb|250px|Chinese [[jade]] and [[steatite]] plaques, in the [[Scythian]]-style animal art of the steppes. 4th-3rd century BCE. [[British Museum]].]]
Many artistic influences transited along the [[Silk Road]], especially through the [[Central Asia]], where [[Hellenistic]], [[Iran]]ian, [[India]]n and [[China|Chinese]] influence were able to interact. In particular [[Greco-Buddhist art]] represent one of the most vivid examples of this interaction.
As shown on the 1st century CE Silk Road map, there is no single road but a whole network of long-distance routes: mainly two land routes and one sea route.

==Scythian art==
Following contacts of metropolitan China with nomadic western and northwestern border territories in the 8th century BCE, [[gold]] was introduced from [[Central Asia]],  and Chinese [[jade]] carvers began to make imitation designs of the [[steppe]]s, adopting the [[Scythian]]-style animal art of the steppes (descriptions of animals locked in combat). This style is particularly reflected in the rectangular belt plaques made of [[gold]] and [[bronze]] with alternate versions in [[jade]] and [[steatite]].&lt;ref&gt;''"There is evidence of gold belt-plaques with "Scythian" "animal style" art, greaves, barrows and other indications of the penetration of steppe cultures south of the Yangzi before the Han period"'' (Mallory and Mair "The Tarim Mummies", p.329)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}
Even though that happened, the correspondence between the "Scythians" as an ethnic group and their material culture is still subject to discussion and research. The subject is  part of the broader "nomadic" and "sedentary"  debate.

==Hellenistic art==
[[File:ZhouVase.JPG|thumb|180px|left|Western-influenced [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] vase with glass inlays, 4th-3rd century BCE, [[British Museum]].]]
[[File:WhiteHanBronzeMirror.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]]/[[Han dynasty|Han]] bronze mirror with glass inlays, perhaps incorporated Greco-Roman artistic patterns (rosette flowers, geometric lines, and glass inlays). [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].]]
Following the expansion of the [[Greco-Bactrian]]s into Central Asia, Greek influences on Han art have often been suggested ([[Hirth]], [[Rostovtzeff]]). Designs with [[Rosette (design)|rosette]] flowers, geometric lines, and glass inlays, suggestive of Hellenistic influences, can be found on some early [[Han dynasty]] bronze mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou bowl: ''"RED EARTHENWARE BOWL, DECORATED WITH A SLIP AND INLAID WITH GLASS PASTE. Eastern Zhou period, 4th-3rd century BC. This bowl was probably intended to copy a more precious and possibly foreign vessel in bronze or even silver. Glass was little used in China. Its popularity at the end of the Eastern Zhou period was probably due to foreign influence."'' British Museum notice to the bowl (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"The things which China received from the Graeco-Iranian world- the pomegranate and other "Chang-Kien" plants, the heavy equipment of the cataphract, the traces of Greeks influence on Han art (such as) the famous white bronze mirror of the Han period with Graeco-Bactrian designs (...) in the Victoria and Albert Museum"'' (W. W. Tarn, ''The Greeks in Bactria and India'', 1980, pp. 363-364)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greco-Buddhist art==

===Buddha===
[[File:BuddhaEvolution.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Iconographic evolution of the Buddha. '''Left:''' A buddha in the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], 3rd century CE. '''Right:''' A Buddha in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], [[Japan]] (1252).]]

[[File:Seokguram Buddha.JPG|thumb|250px|A Buddha in [[Seokguram]], South Korea. It was influenced by [[Gandhara]] art.]]

The image of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], originating during the 1st century CE in northern India (areas of [[Gandhara]] and [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]]) was transmitted progressively through Central Asia and then China until it reached Japan in the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;''"Needless to say, the influence of Greek art on Japanese Buddhist art, via the Buddhist art of Gandhara and India, was already partly known in, for example, the comparison of the wavy drapery of the Buddha images, in what was, originally, a typical Greek style"'' (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p19)&lt;/ref&gt;

To this day however the transmission of many iconographical details is still visible, such as the [[Hercules]] inspiration behind the [[Nio]] guardian deities in front of [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Japanese Buddhist temples]], or representations of the Buddha reminiscent of Greek art such as the Buddha in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]].

==Eastern iconography in the West==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:KanishkaBuddha2.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The Buddha (with the legend "BODDO" in Greek script) with an aureole envelopping the whole body, on a coin of the [[Kushan]] king [[Kanishka]], 2nd century AD.]] --&gt;
Some elements of western iconography were adopted from the East along the Silk Road. The [[aureole]] in Christian art first appeared in the 5th century, but practically the same device was known several centuries earlier, in non-Christian [[art]]. It is found in some [[Persian people|Persian]] representations of kings and Gods, and appears on coins of the [[Kushan]] kings [[Kanishka]], [[Huvishka]] and [[Vasudeva]], as well as on most representations of the Buddha in [[Greco-Buddhist art]] from the 1st century CE.
Another image which appears to have transferred from China via the Silk Road is the symbol of the [[Three hares]], showing three animals running in a circle. It has been traced back to the [[Sui dynasty]] in China, and is still to be found in sacred sites in many parts of Western Europe, and especially in churches in [[Dartmoor]], [[Devon]].

===Shukongoshin===

[[File:Heracles-Shukongoshin.JPG|thumb|280px|Iconographical evolution from the Greek god [[Herakles]] to the Japanese god [[Shukong&amp;#333;shin]]. From left to right: '''1)''' [[Herakles]] (Louvre Museum). '''2)''' [[Herakles]] on coin of [[Greco-Bactrian]] king [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius I]]. '''3)''' [[Vajrapani]], the protector of the Buddha, depicted as Herakles in the Greco-Buddhist art of [[Gandhara]]. '''4)''' Shukongōshin, manifestation of [[Vajrapani]], as protector deity of [[Buddhist temples in Japan]].]]Another Buddhist deity, named [[Shukongoshin]], one of the wrath-filled protector deities of Buddhist temples in Japan, is also an interesting case of transmission of the image of the famous Greek god [[Herakles]] to the Far-East along the Silk Road. [[Herakles]] was used in Greco-Buddhist art to represent [[Vajrapani]], the protector of the Buddha, and his representation was then used in China and Japan to depict the protector gods of Buddhist temples.&lt;ref&gt;''"The origin of the image of Vajrapani should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modelled after that of Hercules. (...) The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterwards transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardina Deities (Nio)."'' (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p23)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WindGods.JPG|thumb|280px|Iconographical evolution of the Wind God. '''Left:''' Greek Wind God from [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], 2nd century. '''Middle:''' Wind God from (Kızıl), [[Tarim Basin]], 7th century. '''Right:''' Japanese Wind God [[Fūjin]], 17th century.]]Various other artistic influences from the Silk Road can be found in Asia, one of the most striking being that of the Greek Wind God [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]], transiting through Central Asia and China to become the Japanese [[Shinto]] wind god [[Fūjin]].&lt;ref&gt;''"The Japanese wind god images do not belong to a separate tradition apart from that of their Western counter-parts but share the same origins. (...) One of the characteristics of these Far Eastern wind god images is the wind bag held by this god with both hands, the origin of which can be traced back to the shawl or mantle worn by Boreas/ Oado."'' (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p21)&lt;/ref&gt;

In consistency with Greek iconography for Boreas, the Japanese wind god holds above his head with his two hands a draping or "wind bag" in the same general attitude. The abundance of hair have been kept in the Japanese rendering, as well as exaggerated facial features.

===Floral scroll pattern===

'''Middle right:''' Japanese temple tile, 7th century, [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. '''Bottom:''' Tile detail from a Japanese contemporary house, [[Tokyo]], 2005.]]Finally, the Greek artistic motif of the floral scroll was transmitted from the Hellenistic world to the area of the [[Tarim Basin]] around the 2nd century CE, as seen in [[Serindian art]] and wooden architectural remains. It then was adopted by China between the 4th and 6th century, where it is found on tiles and ceramics, and was then transmitted to Japan where it is found quite literally in the decoration of the roof tiles of Japanese Buddhist temples from around the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;The transmission of the floral scroll pattern from West to East is presented in the regular exhibition of Ancient Japanese Art, at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The clearest one are from the 7th century [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] temple building tiles, some of them exactly depicting vines and grapes. These motifs have evolved towards more symbolic representations, but essentially remain to this day in the roof tile decorations of many Japanese traditional-style buildings.

'''Spray-on hair''' or '''hair in a can''' is a [[hairstyling product]] consisting of an [[aerosol spray]] applied to [[balding]] areas of the [[scalp]] to create artificial [[hair]] covering that area. Spray-on hair generally works in one of two ways. Either it directly colors the scalp and enhances whatever hair is in the area by thickening it, or it generates hair-like filaments that cling to the scalp and existing hair.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Rassman, Robert M. Bernstein, ''Hair Loss and Replacement For Dummies'' (2008), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spray-on hair was one of the products pioneered by [[Ronco]] in the 1980s, under the name "GLH-9" (Great Looking Hair Formula #9).&lt;ref&gt;Gersh Kuntzman, ''Hair!: Mankind's Historic Quest to End Baldness'' (2001), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The product "was popular in the 1990s with 30-minute infomercials for the product on late-night cable TV",&lt;ref name="Segreve"&gt;Kerry Segrave, ''Baldness: A Social History'' (1996), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ronco version sold over a half million cans.&lt;ref name="Segreve"/&gt;

In the [[documentary TV series]] ''[[Bald!]]'', spray-on hair is one of the products tried by a participant on the show, with poor results.

She lived and worked in [[Leningrad]], was a member of the ''[[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists]]'' (before 1992 - the ''[[Leningrad branch of Union of Artists of Russian Federation]]''),&lt;ref&gt;''Directory of Members of the Union of Artists of USSR. Vol.1.'' Moscow, Soviet artist, 1979. P.71.&lt;/ref&gt; and is regarded as one of the brightest representatives of the ''[[Leningrad School of Painting|Leningrad school of painting]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.'' Saint Petersburg, NP-Print Edition, 2007. P.9, 20, 21, 356, 387, 388, 390, 392-395, 398, 400, 404, 405.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Afonina was born on May 13, 1913, in the city ''[[Nikolayev (Ukraine)|Nikolaev]]'', in the ''[[Kherson Governorate]]'' of the ''[[Russian Empire]]'' (present-day [[Ukraine]]), in the family of master Shipyard "Navel" (after [[October Revolution]] Shipyard named Marty).

[[Image:Still life with Pussy-Willows.jpg|thumb|280px|left|[[Still Life with Pussy-Willows]]. 1964]]

In 1931 Taisia Afonina graduated from nine-year school in city ''[[Taganrog]]'', and came to ''[[Leningrad]]'' to obtain an art education. In 1932-1936 she engaged first in the evening classes for working youth, then in the preparatory classes at the ''[[Russian Academy of Arts]]''.

In 1936, after preparatory classes, Afonina was adopted at the first course of Painting Department of the ''[[Repin Institute of Arts|Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]]'', where she studied of [[Mikhail Bernshtein]], [[Victor Oreshnikov]], Pavel Naumov.

In 1941, after the beginning the [[Great Patriotic war]], Taisia Afonina, with her young son and mother, evacuated first to ''[[Ostashkov]]'', then ''[[Vyshny Volochyok]]'', then ''[[Lugansk]]'', Ukraine. In 1943, after the liberation of the German fascists [[Lugansk]], Taisia Afonina was involved in rebuilding the city, teaching drawing and painting in Lugansk Art school. In autumn 1943, with a group of artists she went to the city of [[Krasnodon]] to draw local club before awarding medals to parents of deceased members of the underground anti-fascist [[Komsomol]] organization, ″[[Young Guard (Soviet resistance)|Young Guard]]″. They fought against the Nazis in the occupied city [[Krasnodon]] (in the [[Ukrainian SSR]]), and became known to the whole country.

In 1946, in the May edition of the newspaper of the Academy of Fine Arts ''"For the Socialist Realism"'', Taisa Afonina wrote: ″I saw the pit where they were dumped, the remnants of their bloody clothes, the prison where they were tortured. I talked to their mothers and girlfriends. I wanted to tell, to write about all this, of all their short heroic life″.&lt;ref&gt;''"For the Socialist Realism".'' Leningrad, Newspaper of the Academy of Arts, 1946, May Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Afonina graduated from the ''[[Repin Institute of Arts]]'' in [[Igor Grabar]] personal Art Studio of monumental painting. Her graduate work was a historical painting named ''"Girls of [[Donbass]]"'', dedicated to the memory and heroism members of the Anti-Fascist underground.&lt;ref&gt;''Anniversary Directory graduates of Saint Petersburg State Academic Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture named after Ilya Repin, Russian Academy of Arts. 1915 - 2005''. Saint Petersburg, Pervotsvet Publishing House, 2007. P.56.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation Afonina continued to work in [[Lugansk]] and returned to [[Leningrad]] in 1952. The Lugansk Museum named ''[[Kliment Voroshilov]]'' acquired as early as 1943 the first three paintings by Taisia Afonina: ''"The Germans came"'', ''"Stealing in Germany"'', and ''"Meeting"''. Her paintings were later purchased by the art museums of ''[[Leningrad]]'', ''[[Kostroma]]'', ''[[Krasnodon]]'', ''[[Staraya Ladoga]]'', and the ''[[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris|Museum of Modern Art]]'' in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socrealizm.com.ua/gallery/artist/afonina-tk-1913|title=Ленинградский художник Афонина Таисия Кирилловна (artist Afonina Taisiya Kirillovna)|last=|first=|date=|website=Socialist Realism. Kiev club of collectors|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first participation in an art exhibition was in 1940. Since the beginning of the 1950s, she was constantly involved in art exhibitions of Leningrad artists. She painted landscapes, still-lifes, portraits, and genre compositions. She worked in oil painting and watercolors and was most famous as a master of landscape and still-life painting. In 1946 Taisia Afonina was admitted to the ''[[Leningrad Union of Artists|Leningrad Union of Soviet Artists]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Directory of members of the Leningrad branch of Union of Artists of Russian Federation''. Leningrad, Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1987. P.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first years after graduation Taisia Afonin attracted military subjects and pathos revival. Later she worked more in the genres of portrait and lyrical landscape. In the 1950s she visited [[Ukraine]], [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Carpathians]], Meshchersky locations, where she painted a lot of studies from the life. For her works typical method of tonal painting, the interest to transfer effect of lights and plain air, and subtle coloristic relations. Among her works are such paintings as ''Foundry Conveyor'' (1947), ''Portrait of Kizilshtein-Mikhailova'' (1955), ''Windy Day''&lt;ref&gt;[[Autumn exhibition (Leningrad, 1956)|''Осенняя выставка произведений ленинградских художников 1956 года.

The '''Tapestry of Creation''' or '''Girona Tapestry''' is a [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] panel of [[needlework]]  from the 11th century, housed in the Museum of the [[Cathedral of Girona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Measuring  3.65 x 4.70 m, it originally may have served as baldachin for the Altar of the Holy Cross in the church's entrance. Some believe that it was used as a curtain or even a carpet. It depicts a series of [[theology|theological scenes]] related with the Christian [[creation myth]]s.

The "[[tapestry]]" is actually a panel of [[Couching|couched needlework]] laid down on the surface of the ground fabric, a terracotta wool intertwined with  different colors (red, green, yellow, dark and light blue, gray) wool and white linen threads. The border is formed by a frame, rather deteriorated, containing small square pictures which, according to some scholars, could have been added later to the central sector, due to their different, [[Byzantine art|Byzantine-like]] style and themes.

The tapestry, of which only the upper part remains, is divided into three cycles:
*the [[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis]], presided over by the [[Christ Pantocrator]]
*the cosmic elements
*the Stories of the Holy Cross

The Christ Pantocrator, depicted as a beardless young man, occupies a circle in the center of the tapestry. He is surrounded by a circle whose sectors, aside from the upper one with a dove, symbol of God, show the seven days of the creation, until the creation of [[Adam and Eve]]. The two circles include quotes from the Genesis.

The remaining space in the rectangle including the central disk, houses at the corner four representation of Winds, depicted by four young winged men in Roman-like dresses, driving vessels and blowing air into horns. The central upper square is an old man representing the Year, with the [[Wheel of Time]], while at the upper corners are the personifications of the Rivers of Paradise. The other six upper squares depict the Four Seasons, as well as [[Samson]] and [[Abel]] (or [[Cain]]).

The two lower corners show the personifications of the Sun (left, symbolizing Sunday) and the Moon (right, much deteriorated, symbolizing Monday), while the  side outer squares represent the months (only eight of which survive). At the bottom are incomplete scenes of the discovery of Holy Cross.

[[File:Chardin_attributs_musique_militaire.jpg|thumb|''The Attributes of Military Music'']]
'''''The Attributes of Civilian Music''''' and '''''The Attributes of Military Music''''' are a pair of paintings by [[Jean Siméon Chardin]], commissioned in 1766 by [[Charles-Nicolas Cochin]] for the pediments above the doors to the music room in his Château de Bellevue at [[Meudon]] (Hauts-de-Seine). They were exhibited at the Salon in 1767 and installed in the Château the following year. The Château's goods were later confiscated by the state and the paintings were sold at auction. They were acquired by the portrait painter [[Jean-Sébastien Rouillard]], then by François Marcille and his son [[Eudoxe Marcille|Eudoxe]]. Via a gift from Eudoxe's descendents and from the Société des amis du Louvre, the [[Louvre Museum]] was able to purchase them in 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10521">'''The Painters’ Club of Los Angeles''' was a short-lived arts organization that existed from 1906-1909, and allowed only men as members. When the group disbanded a number of artists who had been members reorganized themselves as the [[California Art Club]], including [[Charles Percy Austin]] (1883-1948), [[Franz Bischoff]] (1864-1929), [[Carl Oscar Borg]] (1879-1947), [[Benjamin Brown (artist)|Benjamin Brown]] (1865-1942), [[Hanson Puthuff]] (1875-1972), [[Jack Wilkinson Smith]] (1873-1949), and [[William Wendt]] (1845-1946). Beginning with its founding in December 1909, the new [[California Art Club]] widened its membership guidelines to include female painters and sculptors of any gender.

==Before The Painters' Club==
Four artists in Indiana, [[Albert Clinton Conner]] (1848-1929), his brother [[Charles Conner]] (1857-1905), [[Frank J. Girardin]] (1856-1945), and [[Micajah Thomas Nordyke]] (1847-1919) were responsible for founding the Rambler’s Sketch Club (c.1881); they soon added [[John Elwood Bundy]] (1853–1933) to their small art group. The Rambler’s Sketch Club became the [[Richmond Art Association]] (founded 1898), which eventually became the [[Richmond Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Antony, The Painter From Indiana, Los Angeles Times, May 7, 1911; pg. III22&lt;/ref&gt; One of these artists, Albert Clinton Conner, moved to California sometime around 1902 and settled in Manhattan Beach.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Edan Milton, Artists in California 1786-1940&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
On March 10, 1906, several Los Angeles area painters got together with the idea of forming a club. Many of them had met each other casually at exhibition openings, but they wanted to create a more formal association. A week later, on March 17, eleven of the group, including [[Albert Clinton Conner]] met at the Los Angeles studio of artist [[William Swift Daniell]] (1865-1933),&lt;ref&gt;Minutes of the Painters' Club, California Art Club Archives&lt;/ref&gt; where The Painters’ Club of Los Angeles was officially created. The intended mission of the club was "to meet in the spirit of comradeship and good temper for mutual criticism and suggestion on one another’s recent work." [[Albert Clinton Conner]] was elected President and [[Antony Anderson]], the Los Angeles Times' first art critic, was chosen to be the first Secretary and Treasurer. Membership was limited to male painters; no women were allowed to join, nor were sculptors of either gender. "It may be that women painters will be admitted later on, but at present they are not eligible."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Antony, Los Angeles Times, April 22, 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

The eleven founding members of The Painters’ Club of Los Angeles present that evening include: [[Antony E. Anderson]] (1863-1939), [[Carl Oscar Borg]] (1879-1947), [[William Henry Cole]] (1870-1955),  [[Albert Clinton Conner]] (1848-1929), [[Frank C. Conner]], [[David H. Dunn]], [[William Swift Daniell]] (1865-1933), [[Frank Elwin Evans]], [[Frank Rensselear Liddell]] (1864-1923), [[Hanson Puthuff]] (1875-1972), and [[George Thomas Winterburn]] (1865-1953).&lt;ref&gt;Minutes of The Painters' Club of Los Angeles, March 17, 1906, California Art Club Archives&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Antony, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, March 25, 1906; 6,2,5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meetings==
Club meetings were held in various member's studios or at art organizations around Los Angeles, often at the Art Students’ League.&lt;ref&gt;April 28, 1906 meeting; Anderson, Antony, Los Angeles Times, Apr. 22, 1906; Apr. 29, 1906&lt;/ref&gt; Members brought their sketches and paintings to be discussed at each meeting: "So far, nobody’s feelings have been hurt, though all have been criticised unmercifully. The work brought in each week shows splendid results from this raking fire of criticism." &lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Antony, Los Angeles Times, April 22, 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Soon after its formation, The Painters' Club was given a small gallery in the art store of Ford, Smith, &amp; Little Co., located at No. 313 Broadway, Los Angeles, for its exclusive use in presenting exhibitions. "Members' pictures will hang there...to see and to buy...there will be no dearth of new pictures from the facile brushes of our own home painters. Drawings in black and white will also be shown, and everything, it is promised, will be of the best." &lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Antony, Los Angeles Times, November 11, 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

The Club presented four or five exhibitions at Ford Smith &amp; Little's, starting in December 1906 and continuing with new exhibitions monthly through January, February, March, and April 1907.

*Ford Smith &amp; Little’s, Dec. 1–31, 1906 &lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Antony, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, December 2, 1906&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ford Smith &amp; Little’s, Jan. 1-31, 1907 &lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Antony, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, January 6, 1907 6,2 3-5&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ford Smith &amp; Little’s, Feb. 1-28, 1907 &lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Antony, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, February 10, 1907; Feb.17, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ford Smith &amp; Little’s, March 1–31, 1907 (Not known if this was a separate exhibit or a continuation of the February exhibit)
*Ford Smith &amp; Little’s, April 1–30, 1907 &lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Antony, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, April 7, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;

The Club later held two large annual exhibitions at the Blanchard Art Gallery in Los Angeles. The First Annual Exhibition was held October 7 – 22, 1908 and showcased eighty-eight pieces of artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Antony, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, October 11, 1908, III2; October 18, 1908, III2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Antony, Los Angeles Times, Oct. 25, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;

The Second Annual Exhibition was held November 1 – 13, 1909. It included "...almost 100 pictures in oil and watercolor, the work of 20 painters." The work included was not juried, as members could choose what work they wanted to exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Antony, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, November 7, 1909, III2 and November 14, 1909, III15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
During the course of its 3-year existence, The Painters' Club of Los Angeles had around 53 members. A number of them went on to become major artists in [[California Impressionism]] as well as significant members of the [[California Art Club]], including its first three Presidents. A membership card was designed by [[Martin Jacob Jackson]]. Some of the more prominent members are listed below.

*AUSTIN, Charles Percy (1883-1948), Active Member
*BISCHOFF, Franz (1864-1929), Active Member
*BORG, Carl Oscar (1879-1947), Charter Member
*BROWN, Benjamin Chambers (1865-1942), Active Member
*CONNER, Albert Clinton ("Pops") (1848-1929), Charter Member
*DANIELL, William Swift (1865-1933), Charter Member
*JACKSON, Martin Jacob (1871-1955), Active Member
*KILPATRICK, Aaron Edward (1872-1953), Active Member
*LIDDELL, Frank Rennsselear (1864-1923), Charter Member
*PUTHUFF, Hanson Duvall (1875-1972), Charter Member
*SMITH, Jack W. (1873-1949), Active Member
*WENDT, William (1845-1946), Active Member

==Disbanding==
In December 1909 the Los Angeles Times announced that The Painters’ Club was disbanding; in the next paragraph a new organization is announced: "...to be called the [[California Art Club]]." &lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Antony, Los Angeles Times, December 12, 1909, III17&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this seemingly sudden breakup, which happened soon after their second Annual Exhibition, there might be some clues. On at least two instances - August 24 and December 12, 1908 - members of the male-only Painters’ Club visited the studios of [[William Wendt]] and [[Julia Bracken Wendt]]. William Wendt had been elected as a member just weeks before their visit on August 4, 1908,&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Antony, Los Angeles Times, August 9, 1908&lt;/ref&gt; but due to club rules regarding women artists, Julia Wendt was never a member, despite the fact that she was a successful sculptress who was exhibiting and working on commissions on a national level. During their first visit the men viewed new paintings by Mr. Wendt and "recent bits of modeling" by Mrs. Wendt, before members of the club were treated to lunch.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Antony, Los Angeles Times, August 30, 1908, III2&lt;/ref&gt; On the second occasion, the club threw the Wendts a surprise party.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Antony, Los Angeles Times, December 13, 1908, III2&lt;/ref&gt;

Tucked in with the announcements of the ending of one art club and the start of another, Antony Anderson casually dropped a snide comment about the new club's decision to allow women artists to join, as if to say we may as well allow them to join because they would find a way to get in anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Antony, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, December 12, 1909&lt;/ref&gt;  Two swift responses to it were printed as Open Letters in the Times: the first by J. B. Wendt in January 1910 and the second by one L. Pinkham, February 1910.

Along with these rebukes, another successful female artist was exhibiting at Blanchard Art Gallery, though not of course with The Painters' Club. [[Helma Heynsen Jahn]] (1874-1925), later a member of the California Art Club, participated in another exhibition that followed just on the heels of the Second Annual Exhibition. Referred to only as "...the second annual exhibition of works by representational oil painters of Southern California...," it ran from November 16 – December 4, 1909, and though "...only 15 painters in oils have contributed to this exhibition...", that included work by major artists [[Franz Bischoff]], [[Carl Oscar Borg]], [[Hanson Puthuff]], and [[William Wendt]]. Perhaps The Painters' Club felt it would ultimately be better to allow women to join and unify the strongest artists, regardless of gender, into one group.

'''Thomas Richard Paxton''' (born October 31, 1937) is an [[United States|American]] [[folk music|folk]] [[singer-songwriter]] who has had a music career spanning more than fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tom-paxton-mn0000934721/biography|title=All Music Bio|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Paxton received a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].&lt;ref name="TPaxGrammyClip"&gt;{{YouTube|Ivh6Y0NrIWA|Tom Paxton Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award Announcement (brief video clip from the 51st Annual Grammy Awards telecast)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WashPostFeb2009"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/06/AR2009020603708.html?referrer=emailarticle Power Of Just Plain Folk, Tom Paxton Humbly Garners Life Grammy], J. Freedom du Lac, ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', February 7, 2009, p. C01&lt;/ref&gt; He is noteworthy as a music educator as well as an advocate for folk singers to combine traditional songs with new compositions.

Paxton's songs have been widely covered, including modern standards such as "[[The Last Thing on My Mind]]", "[[Bottle of Wine]]", "Whose Garden Was This", "The Marvelous Toy", and "Ramblin' Boy".  Paxton's songs have been recorded by [[Pete Seeger]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[The Weavers]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Sandy Denny]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Doc Watson]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], [[The Seekers]], [[Marianne Faithfull]], [[The Kingston Trio]], the [[Chad Mitchell Trio]], [[John Denver]], [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Porter Wagoner]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Flatt &amp; Scruggs]], [[The Move]], [[The Fireballs]], and many others ([[List of works by Tom Paxton#Covers|see covers]]).  He has performed thousands of concerts around the world.{{citation needed|date=May 2016|reason=Source required for information clarification}}

==Early life==
Paxton was born on October 31, 1937, in [[Chicago, Illinois]], to Burt and Esther Paxton. His father was "a chemist, mostly self-educated",&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and as his health began to fail him, the family moved to [[Wickenburg, Arizona]].  It was here that young Paxton began riding horses at the numerous [[Guest ranch|dude ranches]] in the area.  It was also here that he was first introduced to folk music, discovering the music of [[Burl Ives]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, the family moved to [[Bristow, Oklahoma]], which Paxton considers to be his hometown.  Soon after, his father died from a stroke.  Paxton was about fifteen when he received his first stringed instrument, a ukulele.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was given a guitar by his aunt when he was sixteen, and he soon began to immerse himself in the music of Burl Ives and [[Harry Belafonte]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Paxton enrolled at the [[University of Oklahoma]], where he studied in the drama school.  It was here that he first found other enthusiasts of folk music and discovered the music of [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[The Weavers]].  Paxton would later note, "Woody was fearless; he'd take on any issue that got him stirred up&amp;nbsp;... and he became one of my greatest influences."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In college, he was in a group known as the Travellers, and they sang in an off-campus coffeehouse.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
Upon graduating in 1959 with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree, Paxton acted in [[summer stock theatre]] and briefly tried graduate school before joining the [[United States Army|Army]].  While attending the Clerk Typist School in [[Fort Dix]], [[New Jersey]], he began writing songs on his typewriter and spent almost every weekend visiting [[Greenwich Village]] in [[New York City]] during the emerging early 1960s [[American folk music revival|folk revival]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his [[honorable discharge]] from the Army, Paxton auditioned for the Chad Mitchell Trio via publisher [[Milt Okun]] in 1960.  He initially received the part, but his voice did not blend well enough with those of the group members. However, after singing his song "The Marvelous Toy" for Okun, he became the first writer signed to Milt's music publishing company, Cherry Lane Music Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

Paxton soon began performing at [[The Gaslight Cafe]] in Greenwich Village, where he became a mainstay.  In 1962, he recorded a privately produced live album at the Gaslight entitled, ''I'm the Man That Built the Bridges''.  During his stay in Greenwich Village, Paxton published some of his songs in the folk magazines ''[[Broadside Magazine|Broadside]]'' and ''[[Sing Out!]]'', and performed alongside such folksingers as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[Eric Andersen]], [[Dave Van Ronk]], and [[Mississippi John Hurt]].  Paxton met his future wife, Margaret Ann Cummings (known as "Midge"), at the Gaslight one night in January 1963 after being introduced to her by [[David Blue (musician)|David Blue]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pete Seeger]] picked up on a few of Tom Paxton's songs in 1963, including "Ramblin' Boy" (which Seeger performed at [[The Weavers]] reunion concert at [[Carnegie Hall]]) and "What Did You Learn in School Today?" Paxton increased his profile as a performer, appearing at the 1963 [[Newport Folk Festival]], which was recorded by [[Vanguard Records]]. A month after Newport in 1963, Paxton married Midge.  He began traveling the country on the coffeehouse and small-venue circuit before returning to New York.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) pp. 26-29&lt;/ref&gt;  Paxton became involved with causes that promoted [[human rights]], [[civil rights]] and [[labor rights]]. In 1963, Paxton and a group of other folk musicians performed and offered [[moral support]] to [[Strike action|striking]] [[Coal mining|coal miners]] in [[Hazard, Kentucky]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

After returning to New York, Paxton signed with [[Elektra Records]] in 1964, a label which at that time featured a distinguished roster of folk musicians.  He would go on to record seven albums for Elektra.  As the folk revival hit its peak, Paxton began getting more work outside of New York City, including benefit concerts and college campus visits.  In 1964, he took part in the [[Freedom Summer]] and visited the [[Deep South]], with other folk musicians, to perform at [[voter registration drive]]s and civil rights [[Demonstration (people)|rallies]].  His civil rights song "Beau John" was written after attending a Freedom Song Workshop in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and the song "Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney" was written about the murders of three civil rights [[Activism|activists]] ([[Andrew Goodman]], [[Michael Schwerner]] and [[James Chaney]]) in the summer of 1964 by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] near [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]]. Paxton's own compositions began to be increasingly recognized within folk music circles, and in other genres.

Of the songwriters on the Greenwich Village scene of the 1960s, [[Dave Van Ronk]] said, "Dylan is usually cited as the founder of the new song movement, and he certainly became its most visible standard-bearer, but the person who started the whole thing was Tom Paxton&amp;nbsp;... he tested his songs in the crucible of live performance, he found that his own stuff was getting more attention than when he was singing traditional songs or stuff by other people ... he set himself a training regimen of deliberately writing one song every day.  Dylan had not yet showed up when this was happening, and by the time Bobby came on the set, with at most two or three songs he had written, Tom was already singing at least 50 percent his own material.  That said, it was Bobby's success that really got the ball rolling.  Prior to that, the folk community was very much tied to traditional songs, so much so that songwriters would sometimes palm their own stuff off as traditional."&lt;ref&gt;Dave Van Ronk, ''The Mayor of MacDougal Street'' (2006) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Paxton made his first tour of the [[United Kingdom]]. The tour was the beginning of a still-thriving professional relationship that has included yearly performances there. He met [[Bruce Woodley]], one of the founding members of the Australian folk group [[The Seekers]] and they collaborated on the song "Angeline (Is Always Friday)" which The Seekers recorded and featured in their concerts, TV shows and a DVD. In 1967, the rock group [[Clear Light]] recorded a menacing and lengthy psychedelic version of Paxton's song "Mr. Blue" on their only album ''[[Clear Light (album)|Clear Light]]''.  [[Porter Wagoner]] and [[Dolly Parton]]'s recording of "[[The Last Thing on My Mind]]" reached the top ten on the U.S. country singles charts in December 1967.  Then in 1968, Paxton scored a Top 10 radio hit when [[The Fireballs]] recorded his song "[[Bottle of Wine]]".  In the 1960s, Paxton licensed one of his songs, "My Dog's Bigger than Your Dog", for use in a [[Ken-L Ration]] dog food commercial.  Not too fazed by the success of some of his songs, Paxton continued writing and performing. He was not interested in jumping on the [[folk rock]] (or, as he once joked, "folk rot"&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, "Folk Rot", ''[[Sing Out!]]'' (Autumn 1965)&lt;/ref&gt;) bandwagon though, and continued his folk singer-songwriter style on albums like ''Outward Bound'' (1966) and ''Morning Again'' (1968).  On January 20, 1968, three months after the death of Woody Guthrie, Paxton and a number of other prominent folk musicians performed at the [[Harold Leventhal]] produced "A Tribute to Woody Guthrie" concert at New York City's Carnegie Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodyguthrie.org/events/harold.htm|title=Harold Leventhal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paxton decided to try some more elaborate recording techniques, including neo-chamber music with string sections, flutes, horns, piano, various session musicians, as well as his acoustic guitar and vocals, similar to what his labelmate [[Judy Collins]] and his friend [[Phil Ochs]] were experimenting with around this time.  Paxton finally broke into the album pop charts with ''The Things I Notice Now'' in the summer of 1969, and also charted with ''Tom Paxton 6'' in the spring of the following year.  His song "Whose Garden Was This", an [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]] anthem written for the first [[Earth Day]], was later recorded by [[John Denver]] and became the title track of [[Whose Garden Was This|Denver's 1970 album]].  The diverse "Baroque Folk" experimentation on Paxton's recordings was basically short-lived though, and he tended to think that the music was becoming too overproduced and away from the more natural acoustic roots that he loved best.  Regarding this time, he said, "the acoustic guitar has always been what I loved the most&amp;nbsp;... I ''know'' I didn't have that rock mentality or anything.  I was still a kid from a small town in Oklahoma.  And I just wanted to hear folk songs."&lt;ref name="RUnterberger"&gt;Richie Unterberger Interview (2000) http://www.richieunterberger.com/paxton.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Paxton continued to sing and perform his songs on acoustic guitar at his live performances, and it wasn't too long before his albums would once again generally reflect his original traditional-sounding style.

===Middle career===
Paxton, his wife and their two daughters lived in [[Holland Park|Holland Park, London]], for about four years in the early 1970s.  After a stay in England due to professional success and love of the country, Paxton and Midge went on a tour of [[New Zealand]] and [[China]] and even appeared on a Chinese talk show.  Paxton released ''How Come the Sun'' in 1971. The album gave him his highest chart ranking in the U.S. but it only reached number 120 and his next album, ''Peace Will Come'' (1972), barely even reached the charts.  He soon returned to [[New York City]] and the [[Long Island]] town of [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]] before moving to the [[Washington, D.C.]] area around 1977.  After recording three albums for [[Reprise Records]] and a few for "an English label that didn't pan out well",&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Paxton signed with [[Vanguard Records]], with whom he recorded a live album with [[Steve Goodman]], ''New Songs From the Briarpatch'' (1977), which contained some of Paxton's [[topical song]]s of the 1970s, including "Talking Watergate" and "White Bones of Allende" as well as a song dedicated to [[Mississippi John Hurt]] entitled "Did You Hear John Hurt?" In 1978, Paxton released his album ''Heroes'', which contained a song, "Phil", about his friend [[Phil Ochs]], who had taken his own life in 1976.  The album also includes the song "The Death of Stephen Biko", which details the brutal killing of anti-[[History of South Africa in the Apartheid era|apartheid]] activist [[Stephen Biko]] in [[South Africa]]. 
Paxton's 1979 album, ''Up and Up'', contains the song "Let the Sunshine", which addresses issues concerning [[environmentalism]] and [[solar energy]].  Paxton has also performed at the [[Clearwater Festival]], an annual event, started by [[Pete Seeger]], dedicated to environmentalism and cleaning up the [[Hudson River]].  His 1983 album ''Bulletin'' includes a song about [[Woody Guthrie]] entitled "They Couldn't Take the Music."&lt;ref&gt;[[ArtistDirect]], [http://artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,144530,00.html Tom Paxton: ''Bulletin''.] Retrieved November 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

After recording for labels such as Mountain Railroad and Flying Fish in the 1980s, Paxton started his own label, Pax Records, in 1987. It was during this time that Paxton continued to suffer from an undiagnosed and deepening depression that affected his work.  With some advice from Midge, he began to look for a solution and was eventually diagnosed with [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|Attention Deficit Disorder]], for which he received ongoing treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent career===
As the 1990s rolled around, Paxton began delving deeply into [[children's music]], recording nine children's albums during the decade.  In July 1994, Paxton was invited to perform at a folk festival in [[Israel]], "Jacob's Ladder", and he played there and a series of concerts around Israel accompanied by folk guitarist and harmonica player Shay Tochner.  Paxton recorded a live album in 1996 with his good friend Jim Rooney, and it contained some new comical songs about current events.  [[Eric Weissberg]], [[John Gorka]], [[Robin and Linda Williams]], among others, also performed; and the album was titled ''Live: For the Record''.  In the mid-1990s, Paxton also began to give more workshops in songwriting. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In 2000, Paxton once again began to write more of the [[topical song]]s that had been prominent during his early career.  In 2001, he released an album with Anne Hills entitled ''Under American Skies'', and in 2002, he released an album of all new songs entitled ''Looking for the Moon'' (Appleseed Recordings).  At the time of its release, Paxton was quoted saying that it might be his best album so far.&lt;ref&gt;Behind the Beat audio interview (2002) {{cite web |url=http://www.behindthebeat.net/artist.asp?sid=1&amp;ar=320&amp;al=315 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609050609/http://www.behindthebeat.net/artist.asp?sid=1&amp;ar=320&amp;al=315 |archivedate=2007-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Looking for the Moon'' contains the song "The Bravest", which is about the firefighters who gave their lives while trying to save others in New York City on September 11, 2001. Around this time, Paxton began writing and releasing his "Short Shelf Life Songs" about current events for free download on his website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tompaxton.com/download.html Short Shelf Life Songs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703054937/http://tompaxton.com/download.html |date=2007-07-03 }}; accessed June 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Paxton wrote a number of [[Topical song|topical]] [[protest song]]s that were critical of the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration's]] actions. In 2007, he rewrote a song of his from 1965 entitled "Lyndon Johnson Told The Nation", about the [[Vietnam War#Escalation and ground war|escalation of the war in Vietnam]], and transformed it into "George W. Told The Nation", about the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge in the Iraq war]]. In 2007, Tom Paxton  became one of the founding members of the [[Copyright Alliance]], whose purpose is to promote the cultural and economic benefits of copyrights. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In 2008, Paxton rewrote his song "I'm Changing My Name to Chrysler", about the federal [[History of Chrysler#1980s and the Government loan guarantees|loan guarantee to Chrysler in 1979]], as "I Am Changing My Name to Fannie Mae", about the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|700 billion dollar "bailout of the U.S. financial system"]]. He continues to perform yearly tours of the United States and UK. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In March 2015, Paxton released the studio album ''[[Redemption Road (album)|Redemption Road]]''.&lt;ref name="Kickstarter Tom Paxton Redemption Road"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1971199080/tom-paxtons-new-recording-redemption-road |title=Tom Paxton's New Recording-Redemption Road |date= 28 September 2014 |website=[[Kickstarter]] |accessdate= 22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, Paxton released ''Boat In The Water'', his sixty-third album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Tom Paxton Album "Boat In The Water" Out NOW|url=http://www.tompaxton.com/new-tom-paxton-album-boat-in-the-water-out-january-27-2017/|website=tompaxton.com|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paxton is now in "semi-retirement," though he still performs occasional shows and did a 10 venue UK tour in 2017.

==Personal life and family==
Paxton married his wife, Midge, in 1963. They have two daughters, Jennifer and Kate, and three grandsons. Jennifer is a history professor who has published courses for [[The Teaching Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tompaxton.com/jennifer-paxton-and-the-teaching-company/ |title=Jennifer Paxton and The Teaching Company |publisher=Tom Paxton website |author=Tom Paxton |date=March 8, 2010 |accessdate=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has described his [[Politics|political]] [[Ideology|views]] in the following way:  "My own politics more or less resembled [[Will Rogers]]'s politics. He had said that he belonged to no organized political party&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; he was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]&amp;nbsp;... being young and impassioned almost automatically put me over on the radical side of most issues. Being older, I find myself still more or less there, somewhat to my surprise."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000),  p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Midge Paxton died in 2014 after a long illness.

==Awards, honors, and nominations==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12963">[[Image:UniversalWarCover.jpg|thumb|320px|''Universal War'', by Aleksei Kruchenykh, 1916]]
'''''Universal War''''' (ВсеЛенская Война Ъ) is an [[artist's book]] by [[Aleksei Kruchenykh]]&lt;ref&gt;also known as Aleksey Kruchonykh&lt;/ref&gt; published in [[Petrograd]] at the beginning of 1916. Despite being produced in an edition of 100 of which only 12 are known to survive,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A3263&amp;page_number=2&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 MOMA online; Universal War]&lt;/ref&gt; the book has become one of the most famous examples of [[Russian Futurism|Russian Futurist]] book production, and is considered a seminal example of [[avant-garde]] art from the beginning of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stbride.org/friends/conference/hiddentypography/letterassuch.html The Letter as such: Aleksei Kruchenykh as closet typographer, Ash]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Published at the height of Russian involvement in [[World War I]] (see [[Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive]]), the book attempts to echo the chaos and destruction of the war with the chaos and disruption of collage techniques new to the Russian Avant-Garde at the time, and opens with the bleak prophecy "Universal War will take place in 1985". Shortly after the book was published, Kruchenykh left Petrograd to live in a hut in the Caucausus to avoid the draft.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"One of the most outstanding merits of the album- a dadaist work in the fullest sense- is its successful realization of Kruchenykh's concept of collage as an artistic method transcending mere technique and capable of metaphorically expressing the 'discordant concordance' of the age." &lt;ref&gt;Exploring Colour; OLga Rozanova and the early Russian Avant-Garde 1910-1918, Gunanova, p98&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The book is an early attempt to link [[zaum]] poetry (often translated as 'transrational' or 'beyonsense' poetry) with 'zaum' images. In the foreword, Kruchenykh refers to the book as 'Poetic zaum shaking the hand of the pictorial zaum'.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Exploring Colour; Olga Rozanova and the early Russian Avant-Garde 1910-1918, Gunanova, p99&lt;/ref&gt;

''Universal War'' is often erroneously credited as a collaboration between Kruchenykh and his wife, the artist [[Olga Rozanova]]. Whilst the pair often collaborated on artist's books-including ''A Game In Hell'' (1914) and ''Transrational Boog'' (1915)- most authorities now consider the work to be by Kruchenykh alone.&lt;ref&gt;see "In Universal War there is little true creativity because it is the first experiment in (what was for me) a new style." Kruchenykh quoted in 'Exploring Colour: Olga Rozanova and the early Russian Avant-Garde, Nina Gunanova, G+B Arts International, 2000 p 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A3263&amp;page_number=2&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 MOMA online; Universal War]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Russian Avant-Garde Book, Rowell &amp; Wye, MOMA, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; A series of similar collages - also credited to Kruchenykh - in the book ''1918'' was published in [[Tiflis]] (Tbilisi) in January or February 1917,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&amp;d/kruch/lkrucht1.htm Zaum, The Transrational Poetry of Russian Futurism, Janecek]&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Rozanova was still in [[Moscow]] and the [[Verbovka Village Folk Centre]] working for Malevich and, later, [[Narkompros|Izo Narkompros]].&lt;ref&gt;I can't find any reference to Rozanova joining Kruchenykh in the Caucausus or Tiflis; if anyone can provide proof either way, please do&lt;/ref&gt;

==The emergence of Russian futurist books==
[[Image:DestructionOfGardens.jpg|thumb|left|320px|''Destruction Of Gardens'', Collage #6 of ''Universal War'', 1916]]
Kruchenykh had been a member of the [[Gileia]] group in Moscow that had published ''A Slap In the Face of Public Taste'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.391.org/manifestos/futurists_slapintheface.htm ''A Slap In The Face of Public Taste'', 1912, Burliuk, Kruchenykh, Mayakovsky, Khlevnikov, taken from the book of the same name&lt;/ref&gt; a manifesto/provocation, an early [[Succès de scandale]] that helped to establish [[Futurism]] in Russia. He left Gileia in 1912 to join the rival [[Donkey's Tail]] group. Each of the members would collaborate with Kruchenykh on his next three artist's books; ''A Game In Hell'', ''Worldbackwards'' and ''Old-Time Love''. These three publications set the tone for a radical deconstruction of the book format:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"If Kruchenykh had consciously set out to dismantle (nowadays we might say "deconstruct") the legacy of Johannes Gutenberg, it is unlikely that he could have done it more completely....In a series of remarkable book works of 1912 to 1920, Kruchenykh and his collaborators challenged this legacy in an unprecedentedly complete way, step-by-step departing from our European expectations about what a twentieth century book should be," Gerald Janecek&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Janecek quoted in The Russian Avant-Garde Book, 1910-1934, MOMA, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''Universal War'' in Russian literature==
''Universal War'' was an atypical book for Kruchenykh, since despite training as an artist, he usually only supplied the poetry for his books. This allowed collaborating artists such as [[Natalia Goncharova|Natalya Goncharova]], [[Kazimir Malevich]] and Rozanova unusual levels of freedom to integrate their pictures with his hand-written words.&lt;ref&gt;"One can see a new approach to illustration which consists in the fact that the artist has ceased to retell the text by means of drawing. The illustrations are not merely tied to the text-they develop and complete the poetic images or contrast with them. Therefore there is no illustrator in the usual sense in these collections: the artist has become the coauthor of the poet or proasist." Russkaia Futurististicheskaia kniga, Kovtun, quoted in The Russian Avant-Garde Book, Rowell &amp; Wye, MOMA, 2002p45&lt;/ref&gt; ''Universal War'' featured his own collages, in an abstract style Kruchenykh referred to as 'Non-Objective'. The series of collages run parallel to the poetry printed on the first two sheets. Germany is depicted as a belligerent spiky helmet with its shadow, a black panther, fighting Russia.

The book starts with two pages of poems, under the headline "Universal War will take place in 1985"&lt;ref&gt;Translated in Russian Futurism: a History, Markov, MacGibbon &amp; Kee, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; with page references to associate them with specific images. These poems are followed by 12 related collages, consisting of coloured sheets of card-mostly dark blue, but interspersed with grey, white and pink sheets- with various other papers and fabrics stuck to the sheets. Whilst the copies are similar, they show subtle differences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aworldtowin.net/reviews/futurism.html See the Costakis version of Explosion in a Trunk]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poetic and pictorial Zaum===
[[Image:ExplosionOfATrunk.jpg|thumb|320px|''Explosion of a Trunk'', Collage #3 of Universal War, 1916, from the edition in MOMA NY]]
[[Image:UniversalWar.jpg|thumb|320px|Alternative copy of ''Explosion of a Trunk'', from the Costakis Collection]]
Zaum poetry attempted to “…lead the artist far beyond the restraints of socially sanctioned patterns and the vice of national vocabularies"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/~jimlee/AaronYontzFuturism.htm Kruchenykh, quoted in Futurism, Futurist Practices And Modern Futurism, Yontz] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706224133/http://www.unc.edu/~jimlee/AaronYontzFuturism.htm |date=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, whilst similar to [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Marinetti's]] insistence on the [[Concrete poetry|concrete]] nature of words, Kruchenykh insisted that Zaum was a liberation from meaning as well as form.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Kruchenykh] described the new logic of zaum as ‘broader than sense’, a logic that liberated words, letters and sounds from their ‘submission to meaning’ as defined by conventional three-dimensional logic.&lt;ref&gt;Kruchenykh, essay by Humphreys, Grove Art Online&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The poems are short, and are filled with onomatopeiac syllables;

&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In the preface Kruchenykh claimed that the collages were born of the same source as transrational language- 'the liberation of creation from unnecessary conveniences (through non-objectiveness)'.&lt;ref&gt;Kruchenykh, Universal War preface quoted in Exploring Colour; Olga Rozanova and the early Russian Avant-Garde 1910-1918, Gunanova, p99&lt;/ref&gt; He cited the style as originating with Rozanova, and taken up by Malevich under 'the rather uninformative name' of [[Suprematism]]. In fact, the Russian avant-garde were well aware of [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky's]] experiments with [[Abstract art]]. Kandinsky, a Russian living in Munich, regularly returned to Russia, and had contributed to ''A Slap In The Face Of Public Taste'' with a poem from ''Klänge'', an artist's book of sound poetry placed in tandem with abstract woodcuts, published in Munich, 1912. Another seminal artist's book, ''[[La prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France]]'' by [[Blaise Cendrars]] and another Russian, [[Sonia Delaunay]], had been exhibited in Russia in late 1913, and similarly linked colourful abstract images with concrete poetry.

The work pre-dates [[Hans Arp|Hans Arp's]] similar experiments with abstract collages done for the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], an early [[Dada]] venue,&lt;ref&gt;Dada, Dickerman, National Gallery of Art Washington, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; although it's not known if the two men were aware of each other's works.

Unlike the Italian futurists, the attitude of the Russian futurists to the [[First World War|war]] and the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] were at best ambiguous- Kruchenykh, like [[Vasily Kamensky|Kamensky]], dodged the draft by retiring to a wooden hut in the Caucausus sometime in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Russian Futurism: a History, Markov, MacGibbon &amp; Kee, 1969, p336&lt;/ref&gt; By 1917, he had moved to the newly independent (if short-lived), [[menshevik]]-controlled [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]], and became a member with [[Ilia Zdanevich]] and Igor' Terent'ev of the [[avant-garde]] group 41°, centered at the Fantastic Cavern, an underground cabaret in downtown [[Tbilisi|Tiflis]]. The scattering of artists during the revolution effectively brought [[Cubo-Futurism]] to an end, to be replaced by [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]].

There are copies of ''Universal War'' in [[MOMA]], New York, and in the [[George Costakis|Costakis collection]].

'''Wolf ticket''' is a literal translation of the [[Russian language]] phrase {{lang|ru|волчий билет}} (volchiy bilyet), a colloquial expression to denote a version of a document with restrictive clauses in comparison to the full document. Figuratively, the phrase remains in use in many of the countries of the former [[communist bloc]], usually to denote any kind of document that negatively affects one's career.

Originally the phrase was used in [[Imperial Russia]] to denote a document issued in lieu of the [[internal passport]] to persons who were given a half-year postponement of [[katorga]] or [[exile]] for settling personal affairs. Later, it denoted a limited certificate for completion of studies. Unlike a regular diploma, it merely stated that the studies were completed, but the student was not allowed to take exams for reasons of poor study or improper behavior.

A wolf ticket was a serious impediment to one's career. Still later this phrase was applied to a document issued in place of an [[internal passport]] to persons released from imprisonment ("certificate of release"). Usually this kind of document restricted the rights of a citizen in terms of place of residence (the [[101st kilometre]] rule), occupation, and so on.
