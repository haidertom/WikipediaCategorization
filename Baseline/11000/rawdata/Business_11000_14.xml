      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17818">'''Accounting networks and associations''' are [[professional services networks]] whose principal purpose is to provide members resources to assist the clients around the world and hence reduce the uncertainty by bringing together a greater number of resources to work on a problem. The networks and associations operate independently of the independent members. The largest accounting networks are known as the [[Big Four (audit firms)|Big Four]].
==The Big Four==
The '''Big Four''' are the four largest international [[professional services networks]], offering [[audit]], [[Assurance services|assurance]], [[tax]], consulting, advisory, actuarial, [[corporate finance]], and [[legal services]]. They handle the vast majority of [[Financial audit|audits]] for [[Public company|publicly traded companies]] as well as many [[Private company|private companies]], creating an [[oligopoly]] in auditing large companies. It is reported that the Big Four audit 99% of the companies in the [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE 100]], and 96% of the companies in the [[FTSE 250 Index]], an [[Stock market index|index]] of the leading [[Market capitalization|mid-cap]] listing companies.&lt;ref name="FTSE"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703806304576232231353594682 |title=U.K. Auditors Criticized on Bank Crisis |date=2011-03-30 |author=Mario Christodoulou |publisher=Wall Street Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Big Four firms are shown below, with their latest publicly available data. None of the Big Four firms is a single firm; rather, they are [[professional services networks]]. Each is a network of firms, owned and managed independently, which have entered into agreements with other member firms in the network to share a common name, [[brand]] and quality standards. Each network has established an entity to co-ordinate the activities of the network. In one case (KPMG), the co-ordinating entity is Swiss, and in three cases (Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst &amp; Young) the co-ordinating entity is a [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[limited company]]. Those entities do not themselves perform external [[professional services]], and do not own or control the member firms. They are similar to [[law firm network]]s found in the [[legal profession]]. In many cases each member firm practises in a single country, and is structured to comply with the regulatory environment in that country. In 2007 KPMG announced a merger of four member firms (in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]]) to form a single firm. Ernst &amp; Young also includes separate legal entities which manage three of its four areas: Americas, EMEIA ([[Europe]], The [[Middle East]], [[India]] and [[Africa]]), and [[Asia-Pacific]]. (Note: the [[Japan]] area does not have a separate area management entity).  These firms coordinate services performed by local firms within their respective areas but do not perform services or hold ownership in the local entities.&lt;ref name=E&amp;Y&gt;{{cite web|work=Ernst &amp; Young|title=Legal statement|url=http://www.ey.com/GL/EN/home/legal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group was once known as the "Big Eight", and was reduced to the "Big Six" and then "Big Five" by a series of [[merger]]s. The Big Five became the Big Four after the demise of [[Arthur Andersen]] in 2002, following its involvement in the [[Enron scandal]].

== History of accounting networks and associations ==

=== Foundations ===
Accounting networks were created to meet a specific need. “The accounting profession in the U.S. was built upon a state-established monopoly for audits of financial statements.”&lt;ref&gt;Olson, W. E., [http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/1999/0799/features/F28799.HTM “The Accounting Profession in the 20th Century”], The CPA Journal, (July 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Accounting networks arose out of the necessity for public American companies to have audited [[financial statements]] for the [[Securities Exchange Commission]] (SEC).&lt;ref&gt;For the history of accounting networks see: Stevens, The Big Six (1991); Zeff, S. A, [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sazeff/PDF/Horizons,%20Part%20I%20(print).pdf “How the U.S. Accounting Profession Got Where  jkui iujiui nit is today: Part 1”] Accounting Horizons Volume 17, 189–205 (September 2003). Zeff, S. A, [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sazeff/PDF/Horizons,%20Part%20II%20(print).pdf “How the U.S. Accounting Profession Got Where it is today: Part II”]  Accounting Horizons (September 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  For over 70 years, the SEC has continually sought for greater coordination and consistent quality in audits everywhere in the world. Networks were the logical model to address these requirements.  They expanded outside of the United States since financial results had to be audited wherever a company conducted business. In the US, the [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]]'s (PCAOB) regulations provide for inspection of non-United States firms. Without a network with [[common standards]] and internal means of communications, conducting the required audits would not be possible.

There were other profession-based factors which favored the growth of accounting networks. As a result of competition for the audit work, consolidation was inevitable. These include the fact that a network can establish a [[brand]]. A brand establishes the credibility of the network and allows the individual members to charge more. Creating a brand is very difficult when all of the members of a network are providing essentially the same services.

Being a network member establishes that the firm is part of a large group. Additionally, the larger the firm, the more likely it will be invited to render auditing engagements.  A large organized network allows for spreading the costs to price competitively. Ultimately, size is the only real means of differentiation that is readily available on accounting firms to assure clients that they can do international work.&lt;ref&gt;Baskerville, Hat, [http://hdl.handle.net/10036/29637/ Globalization of professional accounting: The Big 8 entering New Zealand] (June 2007) citing Greenwood, Cooper, Hinings, and Brown, “Biggest is best? Strategic assumptions and actions in the Canadian audit industry” Revue Canadienne des Sciences de l’Administration 10(4) 308–322 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Networks also reflect the clients’ needs for seamless worldwide services because they are more efficient and cost-effective.,&lt;ref&gt;Freidheim, Cyrus, The Trillion Dollar Corporation (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of the accounting firm, a global regulated organization with consistently applied standards significantly reduced the risk. However, increasing the size of the networks can enhance [[legal liability]] risks and [[quality control]] issues that have not been resolved.

With these factors in play, some networks continued to grow; others remained in a stasis position. Individual members of networks began to offer other services related to accounting. These services included [[forensic accounting]], business appraisals, [[employee benefits]] planning, [[strategic planning]], and almost anything associated with financial parts of the client’s business. The network’s structure easily accommodated these services and their geographical expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Aharoni “Internationalization of Professional Services: Implications for the Accounting Profession” in Brock, Powell and Hindings, Restructuring the Professional Organization (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Big Four (audit firms)|Big 8 consolidated to become Big 6, the Big 5 and then the Big 4]], new networks naturally developed to emulate them. [[BDO International|BDO]] and [[Grant Thornton]] were the earliest followers. Networks were then developed to serve mid-market companies and private businesses. New networks also sprang up as an extension of a single accounting firm in the same way the Big 8 were formed. New structures were created to further extend the networks.

The largest accounting networks adopted trade names that each member used. The names of the original firms that became part of the networks were lost and replaced with trade names. For example, PriceWaterhouseCoopers became [[PWC]].  The perception was created that these networks were more than networks, but single entities rather than completely independent firms. This was never the case.  The result was that the Big 8 concept was established which separated the eight firms from all other accounting firms.

Another factor in the development of networks in accounting was the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants| American Institute of Certified Public Accountants(AICPA)]]’s prohibition of advertising. While the largest firms indirectly advertised their services, the small firms complied with the rules and believed advertising to be unprofessional. Additionally, midsize firms were de facto restricted from advertising simply because of limited budgets. They could not create a brand that was able to compete with the one established by the Big 8. The advertising restriction was lifted in the 1970s by the [[Federal Trade Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;American Inst. of [[Certified Public Accountant]]s, 113 F.T.C. 698 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multidisciplinary expansion ===

In the 1990s, the large accounting firms reached another ceiling in the services they made available to their clients. Having reached their natural limit on growth with more than 90% of auditing for public companies, the Big 6 branched out to become [[multidisciplinary]] in [[legal]], [[technology]], and [[employment]] services. Since the essential infrastructure was in place, it was thought to be relatively simple to incorporate other services into the existing network. As a network, it was natural to create independent entities in these other [[professions]] which themselves could be part of the network. The method and structures varied from firm to firm.

When the Big 6 began its expansion to the legal profession, it was met with fierce opposition from [[Law firm|law firms]] and bar associations. Commissions, panels and committees were established by legal and accounting firms to argue their positions. [[Government agency|Government agencies]] were enlisted. For more than five years the debate escalated.  This movement ended abruptly with the fall of [[Arthur Andersen]] as a result of its association with [[Enron]]. [[Sarbanes Oxley]] followed, which effectively ended this trend.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Some international associations of independent firms, such as [[Alliott Group]], now include law firms within the membership.

== Vicarious liability ==

Accounting networks are now facing a new challenge that go to the heart of the image that the firms wish to project to clients. The perception has been that the Big 4, Grant Thornton and BDO are single entities that perform services around the world for clients of this single entity. As a result of court cases this has introduced significant [[vicarious liability]] issues requiring the networks to distance themselves from the perception of being a single entity. The [[Parmalat]] case is the best illustration of the issues.

While the firms have lost a number of cases, the facts and circumstance, or procedural elements have reduced their actual liability.

== Networks versus associations ==

The [[vicarious liability]] issues carry over into operations. Regulations in the EU have been imposed that require the “networks” to define whether they are "associations" of independent firm or are more integrated networks operationally and financially.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/print_artice/aa/feature/1748284/networks-survey-global-risk/   Networks Survey: global risk, Accountancy Age] Smith, Phil November, 2008 Code of Ethics 290 revised the determination. It should be “made in light of whether a reasonable and informed third party would be likely to conclude that a network exists. A referral network is not a network by this definition. The shared costs must be significant. Common quality system and [[Strategic management|business strategies]] are important considerations.”&lt;/ref&gt; Additional standards have been passed by IFAC, an independent associations of accountants, on distinguishing networks from associations.  The objectives of each are to provide the clients a level of understanding about the degree of integration with each other.  Examples of [[international]] associations of accounting firms include Alliott Group, Geneva Group International and Leading Edge Alliance.

== Conflicts of interest ==

Self-definition as a network or associations may determine if there is a  [[conflict of interest]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/26/9/2495220.pdf OECD Report: [[Conflict of interest|Conflicts of Interest]] in Accounting and Auditing]&lt;/ref&gt;  If the group is perceived as a network, it may be foreclosed from representation of clients because they cannot represent a competitor. Association members would not be foreclosed from representation because the firms are perceived as independent by clients.

== Big 4 dominance of public company audits ==

Accounting scandals have again focused on the fact that the Big 4 has a near [[monopoly]] on audits of public companies.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Kroll, [http://www.cfoworld.com/accounting/2490/get-accounting-firms-are-backing-more-regulation Get This: Accounting Firms are backing more regulation], CFO World Newsletter February 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Networks are demanding regulations on auditing to require that auditors rotate and include the smaller networks in this rotation.&lt;ref&gt;Plans Grow for European Audit Cop, Wall Street Journal October 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The demands also request that mid-market firms be able to participate to break up the [[monopoly]] of the Big 4.

The '''Association of Professional Financial Advisers''' or '''APFA''' is a [[trade association]] made up of [[financial adviser]]s across the [[United Kingdom]].  It is currently chaired by [[Lord Deben]].

== History ==

APFA formed in 1999 as the Association of Independent Financial Advisers or AIFA. They formed under the basis from a proposal that there would be a single [[trade association]] to represent independent [[financial adviser]]s. [[Lord Hunt of Wirral]] was at the chair of the body until his resignation in 2002. He was replaced in 2003 by [[Lord Deben|John Gummer MP]], who was awarded a peerage in the [[2010 Dissolution Honours List]].&lt;ref name="eadt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gummer's pride at peerage|url=http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/politics/gummer_s_pride_at_peerage_1_380434|publisher=Ken McErlain|accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, the association changed its name from Association of Independent Financial Advisers to Association of Professional Financial Advisers.&lt;ref name="apfa"&gt;{{cite web|title=AIFA rebrands as Association of Professional Financial Advisers|url=http://www.apfa.net/news/press.php?id=322|publisher=APFA|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change was ratified following a vote at the organisation’s annual general meeting, and meant that APFA from then on would represent [[financial adviser]]s who are independent or restricted. The decision was taken so it would enable APFA to continue representing members affected by the rule changes in the [[Retail Distribution Review]].&lt;ref name="fca"&gt;{{cite web|title=Retail Distribution Review (RDR) |url=http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/firm-types/sole-advisers/rdr |publisher=FCA |accessdate=1 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405031222/http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/firm-types/sole-advisers/rdr |archivedate=2013-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

APFA has a membership of [[financial adviser]]s for whom they represent. Members are also invited to join the APFA Council. The APFA Council discusses policy issues and acts as a platform of discussion between the organisation and its membership.

In 2003 the Association of Mortgage Intermediaries or AMI was formed as a subsidiary company of the then AIFA. There was a subsequent split in 2012 whereby they both became individual entities.&lt;ref name="moneymarketing"&gt;{{cite web|title=AMI and AIFA to split|url=http://www.moneymarketing.co.uk/mortgages/ami-and-aifa-to-split/1045919.article|publisher=Nicole Blackmore|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

The Association of Professional Financial Advisers specialises in the [[financial services]] sector. It represents the collective interests of its membership. The association campaigns in the interest of the financial adviser community and lobbies regulators and the [[government]] both at a [[nation]]al and a [[Europe]]an level.

Based in [[Glen Osmond, South Australia|Glen Osmond]], [[South Australia]], the '''Australian Society of Viticulture and Oenology''' (ASVO) is a non-political organization that was founded in 1980 to serve the interests of practicing winemakers and viticulturists by encouraging the exchange of technical information.  It publishes the ''Australian Journal of [[Grape]] and [[Wine]] Research'' and has over 1,300 individual and corporate members.

==Objectives==
The organization's major objectives are:

'''Business process outsourcing to India''' refers to the [[business process outsourcing]] services in the outsourcing industry in India, catering mainly to Western operations of [[multinational corporation]]s (MNCs).

As of 2012, around 2.8 million people work in outsourcing sector.&lt;ref name="feout"/&gt; Annual revenues are around $11 billion,&lt;ref name="feout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/indias-outsourcing-revenue-to-hit-50-bn/266661/|title=India's outsourcing revenue to hit $50 bn|publisher=Financial Express|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; around 1% of GDP. Around 2.5 million people graduate in India every year. Wages are rising by 10–15 percent as a result of skill shortage.&lt;ref name="feout"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Gurgoan5.JPG|thumb|right|A BPO hub in DLF Cyber City in [[Gurgaon]], India.]]

===Amex===
In the second half of the 1980s, [[American Express]] consolidated its JAPAC (Japan and Asia Pacific) [[back office]] operations into [[Gurgaon]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanexpress.com/india/customerservice/contactamex_phone.shtml Amex Phone and Address listings]&lt;/ref&gt; This centre (called the Financial Resource Centre East or FRC-E)was headed by an Expat Harry Robertson, a veteran American Express employee with Raman Roy reporting to him, Raman Roy later on quit Amex to join GE and later on started his own enterprise called Spectramind which got later on merged with Wipro and then later on started [[Quatrro]] BPO.

===General Electric===
In the 1990s [[Jack Welch]] was influenced by [[K.P. Singh]], (a Delhi-based realtor) to look at [[Gurgaon]] in the NCR region as a base for back office operations. [[Pramod Bhasin]], the India head of G.E. hired Raman Roy and several of his management from American Express to start this enterprise called [[GECIS]] (GE Capital International Services). Raman for the first time tried out voice operations out of India. The operations in India were the Beta site for the GE [[Six sigma]] enterprise, as well. The results made GE ramp up their Indian presence and look at other locations. In 2004 GECIS was spun off as a separate legal entity by GE, called [[Genpact]]. GE has retained a 40% stake and sold a 60% stake for $500 million to two equity companies, [[Oak Hill Capital Partners]] and [[General Atlantic Partners]]..
[[File:Infosys India.JPG|thumb|250px|'''IT:''' The headquarters of [[Infosys]], India's third largest IT company, is located in Bengaluru]]

===Third party BPOs===
Until G.E. most of the work was being done by "captives"- a term used for in house work being done for the parent organisation. In 2000 Raman Roy and some team members from GECIS quit, and with VC funding from Chrysalis Capital, started Spectramind. At the same time, an organisation called Efunds started in Mumbai and Gurgaon, vCustomer in New Delhi and Daksh in Gurgaon. One of the current big BPO firms, EXL Services, started in April 1999, and in 2012 hit $442.9 million in revenues.

However, recently, most of the Indian BPOs, even smaller and mid-sized ones, are setting up their onshore presence in the markets they serve. Most of the large players are improving the outsourced business processes by leveraging on their years of experience, and now some are offering more than just plain vanilla BPO processes. KPO, transformation and Consulting opportunities are gaining favour among large third party BPO providers like Genpact, Infosys BPM, WNS and EXL Services.

===Future of outsourcing services to India===
Analysts believe that India remains a vital destination for outsourcing and expect its annual GDP to grow at 8–10% for the next decade. In addition, outsourcing efforts to India are held up as an effective remedy for concerns about both Chinese government policy and labour force issues, such as increasing costs and shortages.

==Size of the industry ==

The industry has been growing rapidly. It grew at a rate of 38% over 2005.  For the FY06 financial year the projections is of US$7.2 billion worth of services provided by this industry. The base in terms of headcount being roughly 400,000 people directly employed in this Industry.  The global BPO Industry is estimated to be worth 120–150 billion dollars, of this the offshore BPO is estimated to be some US$11.4 billion. India thus has some 5–6% share of the total Industry, but a commanding 63% share of the offshore component.  The U.S $7.2 billion also represents some 20% of the IT and BPO Industry which is in total expected to have revenues worth US$36 billion for 2006. The headcount at 400,000 is some 40% of the approximate one million workers estimated to be directly employed in the IT and BPO Sector.

The related Industry dependent on this are Catering, BPO training and recruitment, transport vendors (home pick up and drops for night shifts being the norm in the industry), security agencies, facilities management companies.

== Registration of BPO as OSP ==
BPO/KPO/Domestic &amp; International Call Centres/NOC etc. are covered under the 'Other Service Provider' (OSP) Category by the Department of Telecommunications.

The companies who are providing the 'Applications Services' means providing services like tele-banking, tele-medicine, tele-education, tele-trading, e-commerce, call centre, network operation centre and other IT Enabled Services, by using Telecom Resources provided by
Authorised Telecom Service Providers. The 'Telecom Resource' means Telecom facilities used by the OSP including, but not limited to Public Switched Telecom Network (PSTN), Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN), Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and /or the telecom bandwidth provided by authorized telecom service provider having valid licence under Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.
The 'Company' means a company registered under Indian Companies Act including foreign companies permitted by RBI under Foreign Exchange Management Regulations and registered under Part-XI(Section 591 to 608) of the Companies Act, 1956 for setting up a place of business in India.
'Domestic OSP' are the OSP providing the Application Services within national
boundaries. 'International OSP' are the OSP providing the Application Services beyond
national boundaries.

=== General conditions of OSP registration ===

(1) Registration may be granted to any company to provide Application Services. These service providers will not infringe on the jurisdiction of other Authorised Telecom Service Providers and they will not provide switched telephony.
(2) The entities entitled for OSP registration must be a company registered under
Indian Companies Act,1956.
(3) A Company may apply for registration to the Authority in the proforma prescribed by the Authority from time to time.

=== Online system for OSP registration ===

It is mandatory to get new Registration Number allotted by the Online OSP Registration system for the existing OSP Registrations. In case you have existing registered OSP sites for which you would like to get the new Registration Number from the system please contact Assistant Director General (ADG) of the concerned Telecom Enforcement, Resource and Monitoring Cell (TERM Cell)&lt;ref&gt;[http://dot.gov.in/vtm/vtm.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915140722/http://dot.gov.in/vtm/vtm.htm|date=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; preferably before applying for the login-id from the system.

Terms and conditions of the OSP registration are available on the DOT website

[[Bangalore]], [[Chennai]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Gurgaon]], [[National Capital Region (India)|NCR]], [[Ahmedabad]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Pune]] are Tier I cities that are leading IT cities in India.

With rising infrastructure costs in these cities, many BPO's are shifting operations to Tier II cities like [[Nashik]], [[Sangli]], [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] (Maharashtra), [[Mangalore]], [[Mysore]], [[Hubli-Dharwad]], [[Belgaum]], [[Coimbatore]], [[Nagpur]], [[Trichy]], [[Kochi, India|Kochi]], [[Trivandrum]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Mohali]], [[Panchkula]], [[Bhubaneshwar]], [[Jaipur]], [[Visakhapatnam]], [[Raipur]] and [[Lucknow]].

Tier II cities offer lower [[business process overhead]] compared to Tier I cities, but have a less reliable infrastructure system which may hamper dedicated operations. The [[Government of India]] in partnership with private infrastructure corporations is working on bringing all around development and providing robust infrastructure all over the nation.

==Criticisms==

The BPO industry in India has attracted criticism from some observers.

* Shehzad Nadeem, of the Sociology Department at Lehman College, City University of New York, reports that Indian call-centre employees, to confirm to expectations of the US consumers who they support long-distance, are expected to imitate the Western employees they have replaced in terms of the use of US vernacular, even temporarily adopting an Anglo name during the call. While this is true, Nadeem claims further that this temporary switch to an American-like identity inflicts psychological distress, and has led to the adoption of Western-style-consumer lifestyles by the employees, who earn far more than their compatriots.&lt;ref&gt;Nadeem, Shehzad (2011). ''Dead Ringers:How Outsourcing is Changing the Way Indians Understand Themselves'', Princeton University Press, New Jersey. {{ISBN|0691147876}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jyoti Saraswati of the Stern School of Business, New York University, claims that the outsourcing industry's political influence far exceeds the industry's economic contribution, and has allowed the industry to secure the support and resources of the Indian state ahead of other sectors of the national economy where the developmental returns would be far greater.&lt;ref&gt;Saraswati, Jyoti (2012). ''Dot.compradors: Power and Policy in the Development of the Indian Software Industry'', Pluto Press, London. {{ISBN|9780745332659}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another point that should be considered while outsourcing, not only to India but any other region, is Intellectual Property Protection. When companies outsource their work, they have to dilute their core knowledge related to process before transferring the diluted knowledge to the outsourcee. If they fail to do this, the outsourcee can learn enough about the outsourcing organization's business to compete with them later by offering similar services in their own country or even multi-nationally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18113">The '''capitalist peace''', or '''capitalist peace theory''', posits that according to a given criterion for economic development ([[capitalism]]), developed economies have not engaged in war with each other, and rarely enter into low-level disputes. These theories have been proposed as an explanation for the [[democratic peace theory]] by accounting for both democracy and the peace among democratic nations. The exact nature of the causality depends upon both the proposed variable and the measure of the indicator for the concept used.

==History==
The philosophical roots of capitalist peace can be traced back to [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Norman Angell]], and [[Classical liberalism|classical economic theory]]. In his 1795 essay Perpetual Peace, Immanuel Kant argued, among other things, that "the spirit of commerce . . . sooner or later takes hold of every nation, and is incompatible with war."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1939 [1795]. Perpetual Peace. Translated and Edited by Nicholas Murray Butler. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early twentieth century Norman Angell reasoned that trade interdependence in modern economies makes war unprofitable.&lt;ref&gt;Angell, Norman. 1913 [1911]. The Great Illusion: A Study of the Relation of Military Power to National Advantage. G.P. Putnam's Sons: London.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Joseph Schumpeter offered the observation that with the advancement of capitalism people form "an unwarlike disposition."&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter, Joseph. 1955. Imperialism ; Social Classes : Two Essays. Translated by Heinz Norden. New York : Meridian Books. Pp. 66-68&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern capitalist peace emerged with the democratic peace. In one of the earliest systematic confirmations of the democratic peace,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart A. Bremer, "Dangerous Dyads: Conditions Affecting the Likelihood of Interstate War, 1816-1965," ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'', 36:309-41 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart Bremer also examined the relationship between capitalism and war. He found capitalism to be a more powerful force for peace than democracy, yet the democratic peace accrued much more attention in the academic and policy literature. Today at least four theories of capitalist peace can be identified, with some of these theories claiming that a capitalist peace may subsume the democratic one, given that capitalism may be the cause of both democracy and peace.

==Definitions==
A key to explaining the capitalist peace rests on the indicative measures for capitalism. There are at least four different definitions of capitalism currently being employed. {{Citation Needed|reason=There's just so many claims here without any citation at all|date=June 2018}}

===Capitalism&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;===
A number of models of the capitalist peace equate free markets with capitalism. In this usage, free markets and trade cause economic development, which in turn accounts for the peace among nations with advanced economies.

===Capitalism&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
A second understanding of capitalism is one that is conceptualized based on the intensity of market contracting in a society, where a capitalist economy is defined as one where most actors in the economy are integrated by contracting in the market. By definition contracts must be voluntary and undertaken without coercion.

===Capitalism&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;===
In the third measure for capitalism  inter-state trade is seen as an indicator for a developed, hence a capitalist economy. The level of trade interdependence, therefore, is the operationalized measure of this third type of capitalism.

===Capitalism&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;===
The final way that capitalism has been measured is with the size of government. States that have limited governments, hence large private sectors, are supposed to be capitalist economies. The size of government is used as an indicator for the level of capitalism a state has achieved.

==Explanations==
There are five primary theories that have attempted to explain the capitalist peace, each of which has used one of the above definitions of capitalism. Each theory has achieved varying levels of success and empirical corroboration, although they all rely on capitalism as the main explanatory variable for peace.

===Trade interdependence===
The interdependent trade explanation for the capitalist peace is built on the foundations of classical economic theory. This idea, which can be traced back to Kant, became the original theoretical explanation for the capitalist peace. In 1996, Erich Weede tied trade and free markets to development and peace, proposing that trade interdependence caused peace between nations.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Weede, Economic Development, Social Order, and World Politics. Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Weede followed this up with what he called the "capitalist peace".&lt;ref&gt;Erich Weede, Balance of Power, Globalization and the Capitalist Peace, Potsdam: Liberal Verlag (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the empirical findings of the link between trade and development have been drawn into question, as one study found that the proportion of GDP to foreign trade is only 0.08, measured by logged GDP per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/03050621003785074 | first = Michael | last = Mousseau | year = 2010 | title = Coming to Terms with the Capitalist Peace | url = | journal = International Interactions | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 185–192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic norms theory===
Economic norms theory links the economic conditions of [[clientelism]], which prevail in many lower income societies, and a contract-intensive economy, which prevails in many higher income societies, with divergent political interests and habits.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mousseau, "The Social Market Roots of Democratic Peace," ''International Security'', Vol. 33, No. 4 (Spring 2009), 52-86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mousseau, "Market Civilization and its Clash with Terror," ''International Security'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Winter 2002-2003), 5-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic norms theory arose as an alternative explanation to the democratic peace, because it identified the causal relationship between democracy and peace as spurious. [[Michael Mousseau]] identified contract-intensive economies as a possible cause of both democracy and peace. The explanation is based on two aspects widely accepted in social science: (1) [[bounded rationality]]; and (2) divergent hierarchies between clientelism and contract-intensive economies. In contract-intensive societies, individuals have a loyalty towards the state that enforces the contracts between strangers. As a consequence, individuals in these societies expect that their states enforce contracts reliably and impartially, protect individual rights, and make efforts to enhance the general welfare. Moreover, with the assumption of bounded rationality, individuals routinely dependent on trusting strangers in contracts will develop the habits of trusting strangers and preferring universal rights, impartial law, and liberal democratic government. In contrast, individuals in contract-poor societies will develop the habits of abiding by the commands of group leaders, and distrusting those from out-groups.

According to economic norms theory, the people in contract-rich nations enjoy a permanent and positive peace. As long as their states accede to popular demands and remain reliably impartial, individuals in nations with contract intensive economies have an interest in everyone’s rights and material welfare, within and outside the nation. Consequently, contract-intensive nations not only avoid war with each other but engage in intense levels of mutual cooperation specifically aimed at promoting each other's material welfare. Leaders of nations with contract-poor economies, in contrast, pursue the interests of their dominant groups and have no interest in the security or welfare of members of out-groups, whether they are internal or external to the nation.

===Free capital markets/capital openness===
This theory, originally introduced by [[EriK Gartzke]], [[Quan Li (academic)|Quan Li]], and [[Charles Boehmer]],  argues that nations with a high level of capital openness are able to avoid conflict with each other and maintain a lasting peace. In particular, nations with freer capital markets are more dependent on international investors, because the investors are likely to withdraw if the country is engaged in a war or inter-state conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke, "The Capitalist Peace," ''American Journal of Political Science'', 51:166-191 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke and J. Joseph Hewitt, "International Crises and the Capitalist Peace," ''International Interactions'', 2010 (forthcoming)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, leaders of states give greater credibility to threats made by countries with higher levels of capital openness, causing the aforementioned countries to be more peaceful than others by avoiding the possibility of misrepresentation of information. One particular advantage of this theory is that it has been formalized, which helps ensure its internal consistency. The 2007 study performed by Gartzke claimed to make the democratic peace variable insignificant when capital openness was controlled for, but a later re-examination found this study to have several design errors.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Dafoe, "Democracy Still Matters: The Risks of Sample Censoring and Cross-Sectional and Temporal Controls," (2009). Available at www.allandafoe.com/research.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Using measured logged GDP per capita, development correlates with openness to foreign capital at 0.14, slightly higher than trade.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke, et al., "Investing in the Peace: Economic Interdependence and International Conflict," ''International Organization'', 55:391-438 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the most recent study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/03050621003784846 | author = Erik Gartzke and J. Joseph Hewitt | year = 2010 | title = International Crises and the Capitalist Peace | url = | journal = International Interactions | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 115–145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; failed to control for the variables of economic norms theory and the size of government explanation.

===Size of government===
The size of government explanation for the capitalist peace relies on the fourth definition of capitalism.  Introduced by [[Patrick J. McDonald]],&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. McDonald, "The Purse Strings of Peace," ''American Journal of Political Science'', 51:569-582 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/03050621003784911 | author = Patrick J. McDonald | year = 2010 | title = Capitalism, Commitment, and Peace | url = | journal = International Interactions | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 146–168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea is that smaller governments are more dependent than larger or socialist governments on raising taxes for fighting wars. This makes the commitments of nations with smaller governments more credible than those with larger ones, allowing for nations with smaller governments, and thus "capitalist" economies, to be better positioned for avoiding conflicts.

===Ruling others by force===
This theory, adduces that if men want to oppose war, it is [[statism]] that they must oppose. So long as they hold the tribal notion that the individual is sacrificial fodder for the collective, that some men have the right to rule others by force, and that some (any) alleged "good" can justify it—there can be no peace within a nation and no peace among nations.&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand (1966). "The Roots of War," [[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]].&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
==Golden arches theory==

In [[Thomas L. Friedman]]'s 1999 book ''[[The Lexus and the Olive Tree]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas. (2000) ''The Lexus and the Olive Tree''. New York: Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt; the following observation was presented: "No two countries that both had McDonald's had fought a war against each other since each got its McDonald's". He supported that observation, as a theory, by stating that when a country has reached an [[economic development]] where it has a [[middle class]] strong enough to support a McDonald's network, it would become a "McDonald's country", and will not be interested in fighting wars anymore.

Shortly after the book was published, [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombed Yugoslavia]]. On the first day of the bombing, McDonald's restaurants in [[Belgrade]] were demolished by angry protesters and were rebuilt only after the bombing ended. In the 2000 edition of the book, Friedman argued that this exception proved the rule: the war ended quickly, he argued, partly because the Serbian population did not want to lose their place in a global system "symbolised by McDonald's" (Friedman 2000: 252&amp;ndash;253).

Critics have pointed to two other conflicts fought before 2000 as counterexamples, depending on what one considers "a war":

* The 1989 [[United States invasion of Panama]]
* In 1999, India and Pakistan fought a war over [[Kashmir]], known as the [[Kargil War]]. Both countries had (and continue to have) McDonald's restaurants. Although the war was not fought in all possible theatres (such as Rajasthan and Punjab borders), both countries mobilised their military all along their common borders and both countries made threats involving their nuclear capabilities.

In 2005, Friedman said that he framed this theory in terms of McDonald's [[Golden Arches]] "with [[tongue in cheek|tongue slightly in cheek]]".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas. (2005) [[The Guardian]], 21 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2005 book ''[[The World is Flat]]'' he offered an updated theory he labelled the [[Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention]].

Since 2005, there have been three more conflicts cited as counterexamples:

* The 2006 war between [[Israel]] and [[Lebanon]], following hostilities ongoing since 1973, with [[South Lebanon]] occupied until May 2000. (McDonald's franchises were established in Israel and Lebanon in 1993 and 1998, respectively.) However, the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] were not a party to the fighting, the Israel Defense Forces action being taken instead against the paramilitary group [[Hezbollah]].
* The [[2008 South Ossetia war]] between [[Russia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Both countries had McDonald's at the time (restaurants began in the two countries in 1990 and 1999, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2008/08/russia-georgia-and-ir-theory-part-i.html Russia, Georgia, and IR Theory: Part 1], ''Lawyers, Guns, and Money'' (featuring photos of McDonald's in both countries)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[2014 Crimean crisis]] between Russia and [[Ukraine]]. Both countries had McDonald's at the time.

Friedman's point is that due to [[globalization]], countries that have made strong economic ties with one another have too much to lose to ever go to war with one another. Regardless of whether the statement is true, the conclusions to be drawn are unclear. The global expansion of McDonald's restaurants is a relatively recent phenomenon when put into the context of the [[history of warfare]], and, with a few notable exceptions, has proceeded into relatively stable markets.

==Dell theory==

The '''Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention''', also known as simply the '''Dell Theory''', has been presented by [[Thomas Friedman]] in his book ''[[The World Is Flat]]''. This theory is an updated version of his previous "[[Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention]]".

:"The Dell Theory stipulates: No two countries that are both part of a major global supply chain, like [[Dell]]’s, will ever fight a war against each other as long as they are both part of the same global supply chain."&lt;ref name="Friedman, 421"&gt;''The World is Flat'' ({{ISBN|1-59397-668-2}}), Thomas L. Friedman, pg 421&lt;/ref&gt;

That is, as long as corporations have major [[supply chain]] operations in countries other than that corporation's home country, those countries will never engage in armed conflicts.  This is due to the economic interdependence between nations that arises from a large corporation (such as [[Dell]]) having supply chain operations in multiple global locations and the reluctance of developing nations (in which supply chain operations commonly take place) to give up their newfound wealth.

In his previous book ''[[The Lexus and the Olive Tree]]'', Friedman argued that no two nations with a [[McDonald's]] franchise had ever gone to war with one another: this was known as the [[Golden Arches theory]].  Later, Friedman upgraded that theory into the "Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention" by saying that people or nations don't just want to have a better standard of living as symbolized by McDonald's franchise in their downtown, but want to have the lump of the labour sector that is created by [[globalization]]. That is, developing nations do not want to risk the trust of the multi-national companies who venture into their markets and include them in the global supply chain.

[[Thomas Friedman]] also warns in his book ''[[The World Is Flat]]'' that the Dell Theory should not be interpreted as a guarantee that nations who are deeply involved in global supply chains will not go to war with each other. It rather means that the governments of these nations and their citizens will have very heavy economic costs to consider as they contemplate the possibility of war. These costs include the long-term loss of the country's profitable participation in the global supply chain.

This theory relates with how conflict prevention occurred between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in their [[2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff|2001 - 2002 nuclear standoff]], where India was at risk of losing its global partners. The relationship between the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] was also cited as an example of this theory - they both have strong supply relations with each other and a war between the two seems very unlikely today.

== History ==

In August 2010 when DigitalMR was established, founder, Michalis Michael, had been MD for Western Europe at Masmi, and prior to that, head of the global online division at [[Synovate]], a multinational in market research ranking number 6 globally at the time. Masmi - a current partner to DigitalMR - has supported the company from the start, in fact DigitalMR was incubated from within Masmi in London. The bond between the two companies remains strong with Masmi CEO Dr.Nicos Rossides becoming both a shareholder and chairman of the advisory board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Verrinder |first=James |title=Masmi backs MD Michalis Michael in DigitalMR agency launch |url=http://www.research-live.com/news/news-headlines/masmi-backs-md-michalis-michael-in-digitalmr-agency-launch/4003355 |publisher=Research-live.com }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The first advisory board was made up of the following individuals: Dr.Nicos Rossides; CEO at Masmi, Steve Alexander; president at Symmetrics, Stavros Hadjiyiangou; Managing Partner at A.T.A Associates LLP, Simon Preston; CEO at risebeyond.org and former [[Young Presidents' Organization]] international chairman, Peter Nathanial; partner at Impala partners and former Group Chief Risk Officer for RBS, and Neil Everitt; investor and entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;Verrinder, James. [http://www.research-live.com/news/people/digitalmr-announces-advisory-board/4003873.article "DigitalMR announces advisory board"]"Research-live.com. October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 2011, Michalis Michael participated in an online debate on research and privacy in relation to social media, hosted by GreenBook blog.&lt;ref&gt;Tarran, Brian. [http://www.research-live.com/genning-up-on-the-big-data-privacy-debate/4005855.blog "Genning up on the big data privacy debate"] Research-live.com. August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Michael supported that if the new [[ESOMAR]] and MRS guidelines on privacy, anonymity, and consent were to be implemented, software development companies would probably prevail in the sector. He was the first one to respond in this discussion through a blog post, questioning the Market Research Society's position on the subject,&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Leonard. [http://www.greenbookblog.org/2011/08/07/the-data-privacy-debate-defining-the-future-of-an-industry/ "The Data Privacy Debate:Defining the Future of an Industry"] GreenBookBlog.org. August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that people posting online actually want to be heard, and are aware of the potential consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Bain, Robert. [http://www.research-live.com/features/time-to-rewrite-the-rules-of-research?/4005880.article "Time to rewrite the rules of research?"] Research-live.com. August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2012, the company headquarters moved from their previous location to a larger space at Westminster Business Square in Vauxhall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Office for Expanding DigitalMR|url=http://www.mrweb.com/drno/news16271.htm|publisher=MrWeb.com}} October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

He is an MSc in Maths from [[Annamalai University]] and holds a PhD from [[Indian Institute of Technology, Madras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dpe.nic.in/newsite/biodata/Professors/N.%20Ravichandran0001.pdf |accessdate=12 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111120253/http://dpe.nic.in/newsite/biodata/Professors/N.%20Ravichandran0001.pdf |archivedate=11 November 2011|title=N. Ravichandaran}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently a professor at [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad|IIM Ahmedabad]] in the area of [[Operations Management]] and Quantitative Techniques. He started the five-year Integrated Management Programme at [[Indian Institute of Management Indore|IIM Indore]] and increased the batch size of the flagship PGP programme from 240 to 450.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessworld.in/businessworld/businessworld/content/No-Frills-Professor.html |title=A No Frills Professor &amp;#124; Businessworld |publisher=Businessworld.in |date= |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also credited with rapid creation of world-class infrastructure at IIM Indore. In his tenure, infrastructure was not only envisioned but also implemented in record time. He has also introduced the PGP at RAK in UAE and PGP at Mumbai programmes. The idea behind the PGP at RAK is to meet the demand for skilled managers in the Gulf region. The motive to start PGP at Mumbai is to help IIM Indore connect with the Finance and the Consulting industries. On the burning issue of high EMIs and the restriction on graduates to be able to take risks, he believes that it was a real problem and that steps need to be taken to simplify this situation. He shares his point of view on placements and career opportunities and believes that IIM Indore will be at its peak by 2015. He also says that while he hopes that students at IIM Indore get the best possible career opportunities, the institution is in the business of imparting education and not in the business of being a placement agency. According to him, the best schools in the world do not have a placement process and Indian schools need to rethink the concept of a formal placement process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="When you make good kachoris, people will buy them.

The '''Epica Awards''' are an annual series of communication awards, created in 1987 and based in [[Paris]], France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.adforum.com/award-organization/6650180/epica Epica Awards]. ''Adforum''.&lt;/ref&gt; Having originally focused on the [[Europe, Middle East and Africa]] region exclusively, the awards became global in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epica-awards.com/about-us/history History]. Epica Awards.&lt;/ref&gt; 585 agencies in total submitted to work to the Epica Awards in 2015, representing 75 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winners.epica-awards.com/ Epica 2015 results]. Epica Awards.&lt;/ref&gt;

Epica’s aim is to reward outstanding creativity and help [[Advertising agency|communication agencies]], [[film production]] companies, media consultancies, [[photographer]]s and [[graphic design|design]] studios to develop their reputations beyond their national borders.
The awards are judged during the third week of November by journalists representing the trade press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epica-awards.com/jury.html Jury]. Epica Awards.&lt;/ref&gt; This jury aims to achieve objectivity and widespread coverage of the results. The best work is also published in the annual ''Epica Book'' and shown in the Epica on Tour showcase.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/epica-book-29-9781474261623/ Epica Book 29]''. Bloomsbury.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==

The awards encompass all main communication disciplines: TV, Press, Outdoor, Digital, Mobile, Social, Radio, Promotions, [[Direct marketing|Direct]] &amp; [[Engagement marketing|Experiential]] Marketing, Media, [[Business-to-business|Business-to-Business]], [[Public relations|Public Relations]], Branded Entertainment, Design, [[Packaging]], Integrated Campaigns, Film Craft, Photography and Print Craft. Complete results of the annual awards are announced in the press and confirmed on the Epica website during the last week of November every year. Category winners (gold, silver and bronze) receive an Epica crystal pyramid. Gold, silver and bronze winners also receive certificates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winners.epica-awards.com/2015 Epica Awards 2015 Winners]. Epica Awards.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Epica Awards are open to all communication agencies, film production companies, media consultancies, digital agencies, PR specialists, photographers and design studios worldwide. Only work that has been approved by clients and used, published or broadcast since 1 July of the previous year is eligible to enter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epica-awards.com/awards/rules Rules]. Epica Awards.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jury and judging criteria ===
The Epica jury consists of editors and senior reporters from marketing magazines and websites; as of 2014, it included journalists from 42 different countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/epica-seeks-higher-profile-awards-show-circuit-166753 Epica Seeks Higher Profile on Awards-Show Circuit Revamps prize categories, welcomes new judges]. ''Adweek''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Epica Awards are the only industry awards to be judged solely by journalists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2014/november/epica-awards-2014-the-winners/ Epica Awards 2014]. ''Creative Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Epica entries are judged on the basis of two criteria only: the originality of the creative idea and the quality of its execution (except in the Craft &amp; Imagery categories where only quality of execution is taken into consideration).

The Epica results are determined by category. The highest scoring entry in each category wins gold, on condition that the work surpasses a minimum score that qualifies it as a category winner. Other entries in each category that achieve this score win silver or bronze. When no entry meets the standard there are no winners in the category. Four Grand Prix are awarded to the best overall film, press, outdoor and digital entries. These are selected from all the category winners. The agency and network with the most awards are given the Agency of the Year and Network of the Year trophies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epica-awards.com/awards/rules Rules]. Epica Awards.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Epica Book'' and Epica on Tour===
All the winners and a selection of other high-scoring entries are published in the annual ''Epica Book'', which they receive a free copy of. The book showcases more than 800 TV commercials, posters, press ads, radio spots, PR projects, promotions, internet sites, graphic design projects, integrated campaigns, direct marketing, branded content and innovative media entries honoured in the previous year's awards.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.epica-awards.com/epica-book.html Epica Book].''

The '''Financial Stability Board''' ('''FSB''') is an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the [[global financial system]]. It was established after the [[2009 G20 London summit|G20 London summit]] in April 2009 as a successor to the [[Financial Stability Forum]] (FSF). The Board includes all [[G20 major economies]], FSF members, and the [[European Commission]]. Hosted and funded by the [[Bank for International Settlements]], the board is based in [[Basel, Switzerland|Basel]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsb.org/contact/|title=Contact|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Financial Stability Forum ===
{{Main|Financial Stability Forum}}

The FSB's predecessor organization, the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), had emerged from a group of [[finance ministry|finance ministries]], [[central bank]]ers, and international financial bodies, which had been founded in 1999 to promote international financial stability by the finance ministers and central bank governors of [[G7]] countries.&lt;ref name="Founding"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Genesis of the FSF | url = http://www.fsforum.org/about/genesis_of_the_fsf.html| work = | publisher = Financial Stability Forum| archive-date = 14 June 2008| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614141837/http://www.fsforum.org/about/genesis_of_the_fsf.html | format = | doi = | accessdate = 30 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSF facilitated discussion and cooperation on supervision and surveillance of financial institutions, transactions, and events. FSF was managed by a small secretariat housed at the [[Bank for International Settlements]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="FSF home"&gt;{{cite web | title = Home/News| work = | publisher = Financial Stability Forum| date = | url = http://www.fsforum.org| archive-date = 12 May 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090512222115/http://www.fsforum.org/ | format = | doi = | accessdate = 30 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSF membership included about a dozen nations who participate through their central banks, financial ministries and departments, and securities regulators, including: the [[United States]], [[Japan]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]] and several other industrialized economies as well as several international economic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Who we are | url = http://www.fsforum.org/about/who_we_are.html| work = | publisher = Financial Stability Forum| archive-date = 14 June 2008| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614141842/http://www.fsforum.org/about/who_we_are.html| format = | doi = | accessdate = 30 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the G20 summit on 15 November 2008, it was agreed that the membership of the FSF will be expanded to include emerging economies, such as China. The [[2009 G20 London summit]] decided to establish a successor to the FSF, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to include members of the G20 who had not been FSF members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Financial Stability Forum decides to broaden its membership |work= |publisher=Financial Stability Forum |date=12 March 2009 |url=http://www.fsforum.org/press/pr_090312b.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411064057/http://www.fsforum.org/press/pr_090312b.pdf |archive-date=11 April 2009 |format= |doi= |accessdate=30 April 2016 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding ===
The Financial Stability Forum met in [[Rome]] on 28–29 March 2008 in connection with the [[Bank for International Settlements]]. Members discussed current challenges in financial markets, and various policy options to address them from this point forward.&lt;ref name="BIS 0308"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bis.org/press/p080329.htm |title=Press release: Financial Stability Forum meets in Rome|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this meeting, the FSF discussed a report to be delivered to [[G7]] Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in April 2008. The report identifies key weaknesses underlying current financial turmoil, and recommends actions to improve market and institutional resilience. The FSF discussed work underway at the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] with regard to [[sovereign wealth fund]]s. The International Monetary Fund is working closely with sovereign wealth funds to identify a set of voluntary best practice guidelines, and is focusing on the governance, institutional arrangements and transparency of sovereign wealth funds.&lt;ref name="BIS 0308"/&gt; On 12 April 2008, the FSF delivered a report to the G7 Finance Ministers detailing its recommendations:&lt;ref name="FSFReport"&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the Financial Stability Forum on Enhancing Market and Institutional Resilience|date=7 April 2008|publisher=Financial Stability Forum|url=http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_0804.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/press/p080412.htm|title=Press release: Financial Stability Forum Recommends Actions to Enhance Market and Institutional Resilience|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Strengthen prudential oversight of capital, liquidity, and risk management
* Enhance transparency and valuation
* Change the role and uses of [[credit rating]]s
* Strengthen the authorities' responsiveness to risks
* Make robust arrangements for dealing with stress in the financial system

=== 2012 reforms ===
The High-Level Panel on the Governance of the FSB was an independent initiative coordinated by [[Domenico Lombardi]] of the [[Brookings Institution]]  and funded by the [[The Connect U.S. Fund|Connect U.S. Fund]]. It assembled a high-level panel of experts, including [[Uganda]]'s former [[Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (Uganda)|Finance Minister]] and [[Governor of the Bank of Uganda|Central Bank Governor]] of Uganda [[Ezra Suruma]], former [[Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan|Prime Minister]] of [[Kyrgyzstan]] [[Djoomart Otorbaev]], former [[Minister of Finance and Public Credit of Colombia|Finance Minister]] of [[Colombia]] [[José Antonio Ocampo]], and [[Jacques Mistral]], a former member of [[France]]'s Council of Economic Analysis.&lt;ref name="newrules"&gt;{{cite web|title=What We Do: High-Level Panel on the Governance of the Financial Stability Board|url=http://www.new-rules.org/what-we-do/fsb-unlocking-the-black-box/hlp-on-fsb-governance|website=New Rules for Global Finance|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lombardi published the panel's final report in September 2011 as a Brookings Issue Paper, concluding that the FSB's governance had not evolved as quickly as its prominence. It made several recommendations:&lt;ref name="brookings"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Domenico Lombardi|authorlink1=Domenico Lombardi|title=The Governance of the Financial Stability Board|date=September 2011|publisher=Brookings Institution|location=Washington, DC|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FSB_Issues_Paper_Lombardi.pdf|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2011 G20 Cannes summit]], the G20 called for a strengthening of the FSB's capacity resources and governance by establishing the FSB "on an enduring organizational basis".&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.fsb.org/about/history/|website=Financial Stability Board|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2012 report to the [[2012 G20 Los Cabos summit|G20 Los Cabos summit]], the FSB set out concrete steps to strengthen the organization's capacity, resources, and governance as well as establish it on an enduring organizational footing. The G20 endorsed the FSB's restated and amended charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report to the G20 Los Cabos Summit on Strengthening FSB Capacity, Resources and Governance|date=12 June 2012|publisher=Financial Stability Board|url=http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_120619c.pdf|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, the FSB became a separate legal entity in the form of an association or "Verein" under Swiss law, when its Articles of Association were adopted by the FSB Plenary.&lt;ref name="ar4"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Financial Stability Board|title=4th Annual Report|date=December 2017|publisher=Financial Stability Board|location=Basel|url=http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P160118.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSB is hosted and funded by the Bank for International Settlements under a five-year agreement executed between the two in January 2013. The bank bears the majority of the FSB's operating expenses, and the FSB does not have any assets, liabilities, or revenue.&lt;ref name="ar4"/&gt;

=== 2016 reforms===

In late July 2016, after the world markets had faced a number of crises, including terrorism and the UK's [[Brexit|decision to leave]] the [[European Union]], Carney sent a letter to Finance Ministers attending the G20 Summit and to Central Bank Governors outlining the reforms the FSB had made&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theasianbanker.com/press-releases/fsb-chair-updates-g20-finance-ministers-and-central-bank-governors-on-progress-in-advancing-the-fsb%E2%80%99s-2016-priorities |title=FSB Chair updates G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on progress in advancing the FSB’s 2016 priorities |author= |date=24 July 2016 |website=The Asian Banker |access-date=25 July 2016 |quote=The letter outlines the progress the FSB is making in advancing its priorities for 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that the global economy and financial system had "continued to function effectively" and had "weathered" the "spikes in uncertainty and risk aversion", confirming that "this resilience in the face of stress demonstrates the enduring benefits of G20 post-crisis reforms". He emphasized the value of specific reforms that had been implemented by the Financial Stability Board stating that these had "dampened aftershocks from [global financial crises] rather than amplifying them". He expressed confidence in the FSB's strategies, stating that "resilience in the face of stress demonstrates the enduring benefits of G20 post-crisis reforms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Szu |first=Ping Chan |date=24 July 2016 |title=G20: Chancellor eyes clarity on Brexit deal 'later this year' as vote raises global risks |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/07/24/g20-chancellor-eyes-clarity-on-brexit-deal-later-this-year-as-vo |work=The Telegraph |location=London, UK |access-date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSB published the pre-G20 summit letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsb.org/2016/07/fsb-chair-updates-g20-finance-ministers-and-central-bank-governors-on-progress-in-advancing-the-fsbs-2016-priorities/ |title=FSB Chair updates G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on progress in advancing the FSB’s 2016 priorities |author=|date=24 July 2016 |website=FSB |publisher=FSB |access-date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in light of the "two spikes in uncertainty and risk aversion" weathered by the global economy and financial system as of late July 2016, which outlined its priorities for 2016:
* Promote a coordinated program of reforms to deliver resilient sources of market-based finance, including addressing structural vulnerabilities associated with [[asset management]]
* Develop robust financial market infrastructure, including assessing policies on central counterparty resilience, recovery, and resolvability, and recommending any necessary improvements
* Support effective [[Macroprudential regulation|macroprudential]] arrangements by drawing lessons from countries that have applied macroprudential policy frameworks and tools, working in partnership with the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[Bank for International Settlements]]

In addition to the priorities listed above, the FSB also sought to:
* Pursue the full and consistent implementation of post-crisis reforms, while addressing material unintended consequences
* Address new and emerging vulnerabilities in the financial system, including those associated with conduct, correspondent banking and climate change
* Monitor the potentially systemic implications of [[Financial technology|financial technology]] [[Financial innovation|innovations]], and the systemic risks arising from operational disruptions

In November 2016, the FSB and the board of the Bank for International Settlements agreed to a further five-year extension of the agreement from January 2018 to 2023.&lt;ref name="ar4"/&gt;

== Overview ==
The FSB represented the G20 leaders' first major international institutional innovation. [[U.S. Treasury]] [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary]] [[Tim Geithner]] has described it as "in effect, a fourth pillar" of the architecture of global economic governance. The FSB has been assigned a number of important tasks, working alongside the International Monetary Fund, [[World Bank]], and the [[World Trade Organization]]. Chairman of the board is the Canadian [[Mark Carney]], [[Governor of the Bank of England|Governor]] of the [[Bank of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mark Carney gets chance to reshape Bank of England after departure of deputy governor|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2013/06/14/mark-carney-gets-chance-to-reshape-bank-of-england-as-deputy-governor-departs |accessdate=20 June 2013|work=[[Financial Post]]|date=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most multilateral financial institutions, the FSB lacks a legal form and any formal power, given that its charter is an informal and nonbinding memorandum of understanding for cooperation adopted by its members.&lt;ref name="brookings"/&gt;

=== Membership ===
The FSB has 68 member institutions, comprising ministries of finance, central banks, and supervisory and regulatory authorities from 25 jurisdictions as well as 10 international organizations and [[Standards organization|standard-setting bodies]], and 6 Regional Consultative Groups reaching out to 65 other jurisdictions around the world.&lt;ref name="ar4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Members"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/members/links.htm |title=Links to FSB members |publisher=Financial Stability Board |accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a 2011 [[Brookings Institution]] report noted, there are no set rules for how the FSB chair is selected, reflecting the FSB's newness as well as the "central banking culture of discretion and informality that permeates the institution".&lt;ref name = "brookings"/&gt;

* [[Mario Draghi]] (2009–2011), current [[President of the European Central Bank|President]] of the [[European Central Bank]] and former Governor of the [[Banca d'Italia|Bank of Italy]]

The '''history of nicotine marketing''' stretches back centuries. [[Nicotine marketing]] has continually developed new techniques in response to historical circumstances, societal and technological change, and regulation. Countermarketing has also changed, in both message and commoness, over the decades, often in response to pro-nicotine marketing.

==Pre-1800==

The coughing, throat irritation, and shortness of breath caused by smoking are obvious, and tobacco was criticized as unhealthy long before the invention of the [[clinical study]]. In the 1604 [[A Counterblaste to Tobacco]], [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland and I of England]] described smoking as "A custome lothsome to the eye, hatefull to the Nose, harmefull to the braine, dangerous to the Lungs, and in the blacke stinking fume thereof, neerest resembling the horrible [[Styx (mythology)|Stigian]] smoke of the pit that is bottomelesse", and urged his subjects not to use tobacco.&lt;ref name=counterblaste&gt;[http://www.laits.utexas.edu/poltheory/james/blaste/ ''A Counterblaste to Tobacco'' (retrieved February 22, 2008)] Quote: A custome lothsome to the eye, hatefull to the Nose, harmefull to the braine, dangerous to the Lungs, and in the blacke stinking fume thereof, neerest resembling the horrible [[Styx (mythology)|Stigian]] smoke of the pit that is bottomelesse.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1600s, many countries banned its use.&lt;ref name="Alston_2002"&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 39| issue = 4| pages = 425–445| last1 = Alston| first1 = Lee J.| last2 = Dupré| first2 = Ruth| last3 = Nonnenmacher| first3 = Tomas| title = Social reformers and regulation: the prohibition of cigarettes in the United States and Canada| journal = Explorations in Economic History| date = 2002|url=https://www.colorado.edu/ibs/es/alston/econ8534/SectionIX/Alston,_Dupre_and_Nonnenmacher,_Social_Reformers_and_Regulation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope]] [[Urban VIII]] issued a 1624 papal bull condemning tobacco and making its use in holy places punishable by excommunication;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Tobacco: A Cultural History of How an Exotic Plant Seduced Civilization| first=Iain| last=Gately| year=2001| publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| isbn=978-0-8021-3960-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Benedict XIII]] repealed the ban one hundred years later.&lt;ref&gt;Cutler, Abigail. "The Ashtray of History", ''The Atlantic Monthly'', January/February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1800–1880==

[[File:Sputt ikkje på golvet.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|right|A sign asks readers (likely tobacco chewers) not to spit on the floor. Part of an anti-[[tuberculosis]] campaign by the [[Norwegian Women's Public Health Association]].]]
The first known nicotine advertisement in the United States was for the snuff and tobacco products and was placed in the New York daily paper in 1789. At the time, American tobacco markets were local. Consumers would generally request tobacco by quality, not brand name, until after the 1840s.&lt;ref name="scriptorke.edu"&gt;[http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/eaa/tobacco.html More About Tobacco Advertising and the Tobacco Collections]. Scriptorium.lib.duke.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many European tobacco bans were repealed during the [[Revolutions of 1848]].

Cigarettes were first made in [[Seville]], from cigar scraps. British soldiers took up the habit during the [[Crimean War]] (1853–1856).&lt;ref name="Alston_2002"/&gt; The [[American Civil War]] in the early 1860s also led to increased demand for tobacco from American soldiers, and in non-tobacco-growing regions.&lt;ref name="Alston_2002"/&gt;

Public health measures against chewing tobacco (spitting, especially other than in a [[spitoon]], spread diseases such as [[influenza|flu]] and [[tuberculosis]]) increased cigarette consumption.&lt;ref name="Alston_2002"/&gt;

After the development of color [[lithography]] in the late 1870s, collectible picture series were printed onto [[cigarette card]]s, previously only used to stiffen the packaging.&lt;ref name="scriptorke.edu"/&gt;

In 1913, a cigarette brand was advertised nationally for the first time in the US. [[RJ Reynolds]] advertised it as milder than competing cigarettes.&lt;ref name=filters_dangerous&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/tc.11.suppl_1.i40 |pmid=11893814 |pmc=1766061 |title=Cigarette filter ventilation is a defective design because of misleading taste, bigger puffs, and blocked vents |journal=Tobacco Control |volume=11 |pages=I40–50 |year=2002 |last1=Kozlowski |first1=L T |last2=O'Connor |first2=R J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher production and cheaper cigarettes gave companies an incentive to increase consumption. By the last quarter of the 19th century, magazines carried advertisements for different brands of cigarettes, snuff, and pipe tobacco.&lt;ref name=time_advertising/&gt; Demand for cigarettes rose exponentially, ~doubling every five years in Canada and the US (until demand began to rise even faster, ~tripling during the four years of [[World War I]]).&lt;ref name="Alston_2002"/&gt;{{rp|429, Fig.1}}

===Anti-tobacco movements===
{{main|Tobacco control}}

[[File:Smoking Dangers - 1905 new.png|thumb|right|"The Deadly Cigarette"; a 1905 cartoon celebrates bans on the sale and possession of tobacco in three U.S. States, and calls on other states follow their lead.]]
In the late 1800s, the [[temperance movement]] was strongly involved in anti-tobacco compaigns, and particularly with the prevention of youth smoking. They argued that smoking was addictive, unhealthy, stunted the growth of children, and, in women, was harmful during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=australian_temperance&gt;{{Cite web| title = The anti-tobacco reform and the temperance movement in Australia: connections and differences. - Free Online Library| accessdate = 2018-05-19| url = https://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+anti-tobacco+reform+and+the+temperance+movement+in+Australia%3a...-a021231027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1890, 26 American states had banned sales to minors. Over the next decade, further restrictions were legislated, including prohibitions on sale; measures were widely circumvented, for instance by selling expensive matches and giving away cigarettes with them, so there were further bans on giving out free samples of cigarettes.&lt;ref name="Alston_2002"/&gt;

After women won the vote in the early 1900s, temperance groups successfully campaigned for [[Juvenile Smoking Law]]s throughout Australia. At this time, most adults there smoked pipes, and cigarettes were used only by juveniles.&lt;ref name=australian_temperance/&gt;

=== World War I ===
[[File:Down with Germany - Welcome to the Boys.jpg|thumb|World War I, circa 1915. A tobacco concession stand, with ads, at [[CFB Valcartier|Valcartier military base]] near [[Quebec City]]]]

Free or subsidized branded cigarettes were distributed to troops during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=time_advertising/&gt; Demand for cigarettes in North America, which had been ~doubling every five years, began to rise even faster, ~tripling during the four years of war.&lt;ref name="Alston_2002"/&gt;{{rp|429, Fig.1}}

In the face of imminent violent death, the health harms of cigarettes became less of a concern, and there was public support for drives to get cigarettes to the front lines.&lt;ref name=australian_temperance/&gt; Billions of cigarettes were distributed to soldiers in Europe by national governments, the [[YMCA]], the [[Salvation Army]], and the [[Red Cross]]. Private individuals also donated money to send cigarettes to the front, even from jurisdictions where the sale of cigarettes was illegal. Not giving soldiers cigarettes was seen as unpatriotic.&lt;ref name="Alston_2002"/&gt;

=== Interwar ===
By the time the war was over, a generation had grown up, and a large proportion of adults smoked, making anti-smoking campaigns substantially more difficult.&lt;ref name=australian_temperance/&gt; Returning soldiers continued to smoke, making smoking more socially acceptable. Temperance groups began to concentrate their efforts on alcohol.&lt;ref name=australian_temperance/&gt; By 1927, American states had repealed all their anti-smoking laws, except those on minors.&lt;ref name="Alston_2002"/&gt;

Modern advertising was created with the innovative techniques used in tobacco advertising beginning in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Gifford2010p15"&gt;Donald G. Gifford (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6UYzFt5Qgk4C&amp;pg=PA15 ''Suing the Tobacco and Lead Pigment Industries''], p.15 quotation: {{quotation|...during the early twentieth century, tobacco manufacturers virtually created the modern advertising and marketing industry as it is known today.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GlantzModernAds"&gt;Stanton Glantz in ''[[Mad Men]] Season 3 Extra – Clearing the Air – The History of Cigarette Advertising'', part 1, min 3:38 quotation: {{quotation|...development of modern advertising. And it was really the tobacco industry, from the beginning, that was at the forefront of the development of modern, innovative, advertising techniques.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising in the interwar period consisted primarily of full page, color magazine and newspaper advertisements. Many companies created slogans for their brand and used [[celebrity endorsements]] from famous men and women. Some advertisements contained fictional doctors reassuring customers that their specific brand was good for health.&lt;ref name=NYT_deadly&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/health/20essay.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Howard | last1=Markel | title=Tracing the Cigarette's Path From Sexy to Deadly | date=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smoking was also widely seen in [[films]], possibly due to paid [[product placement]].{{see below|Films}}

In 1924, menthol cigarettes were invented,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pages/US1555580.png|title=Process of Treating Cigarette Tobacco|publisher=United States Patent Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they were not initially popular, remaining at a few percent of market share until marketing in the fifties.&lt;ref name=FDA_review/&gt;{{rp|35–37}}

In the 1920s, tobacco companies continued to target women, aiming to increase the number of smokers.&lt;ref name="tobaccofreekids1"&gt;[http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/Script/DisplayPressRelease.php3?Display=348 Statement: Surgeon General's Report on Women and Tobacco Underscores Need for Congress to Grant FDA Authority Over Tobacco (Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids)]. Tobaccofreekids.org.&lt;/ref&gt; At first, in light of the threat of tobacco prohibition from temperance unions, marketing was subtle; it indirectly and deniably suggested that women smoked. Testimonials from smoking female celebrities were used. Ads were designed to "prey on female insecurities about weight and diet", encouraging smoking as a healthy alternative to eating sweets.&lt;ref name=women_mass&gt;{{Cite web| title = Targeting women: Mass marketing begins, Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising| accessdate = 2018-05-19| url = http://tobacco.stanford.edu/tobacco_main/images.php?token2=fm_st024.php&amp;token1=fm_img0516.php&amp;theme_file=fm_mt012.php&amp;theme_name=Targeting%20Women&amp;subtheme_name=Mass%20Marketing%20Begins |quote=As the threat of tobacco prohibition from temperance unions settled down in the late 1920s, tobacco companies became bolder with their approach to targeting women through advertisements, openly targeting women in an attempt to broaden their market and increase sales. The late 1920s saw the beginnings of major mass marketing campaigns designed specifically to target women. Cigarette manufacturers have for a long time subtly suggested in some of their advertising that women smoked, a New York Times article from 1927 reveals. But Chesterfield s 1927 Blow some my way campaign was transparent to the public even at the time of printing, and soon after, the campaigns became less and less subtle. In 1928, Lucky Strike introduced its Cream of the Crop campaign, featuring celebrity testimonials from female smokers, and then followed with Reach for a Lucky Instead of a Sweet in 1929, designed to prey on female insecurities about weight and diet. As the decade turned, many cigarette brands came out of the woodwork and joined in on unabashedly targeting women by illustrating women smoking, rather than hinting at it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campaigns used the traditional association that smoking was improper for women to advantage. They marketed cigarettes as "[[Torches of Freedom]]", and made a dependence-inducing drug a symbol of women's independence. Lung cancer rates in women rose sharply.&lt;ref name=lets_smoke_girls&gt;{{Cite web| title = Targeting women:Let's Smoke Girls, Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising| accessdate = 2018-05-19| url = http://tobacco.stanford.edu/tobacco_main/images.php?token2=fm_st025.php&amp;token1=fm_img0541.php&amp;theme_file=fm_mt012.php&amp;theme_name=Targeting%20Women&amp;subtheme_name=Let%27s%20Smoke%20Girls |quote=Before the First World War, smoking was associated with the loose morals of prostitutes and wayward women. Clever marketers managed to turn this around in the 1920s and 1930s, latching onto women s liberation movements and transforming cigarettes into symbols of women's independence. In 1929, as part of this effort, the American Tobacco Company organized marches of women carrying Torches of Freedom (i.e., cigarettes) down New York s 5th Avenue to emphasize their emancipation. The tobacco industry also sponsored training sessions to teach women how to smoke, and competitions for most delicate smoker. Many of the advertisements targeting women throughout the decades have concentrated on women s empowerment. Early examples include I wish I were a man so I could smoke (Velvet, 1912), while later examples like You ve come a long way baby (Virginia Slims) were more clearly exploitive of the Women s Liberation Movement. It is interesting to note that the Marlboro brand, famous for its macho Marlboro Man, was for decades a woman s cigarette (Mild as May with Ivory tips to protect the lips) before it underwent an abrupt sex change in 1954. Only 5 percent of American women smoked in 1923 versus 12 percent in 1932 and 33 percent in 1965 (the peak year). Lung cancer was still a rare disease for women in the 1950s, though by the year 2000 it was killing nearly 70,000 women per year. Cancer of the lung surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer death among women in 1987.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 [[Edward Bernays]], commissioned by the [[American Tobacco Company]] to get more women smoking, decided to hire women to smoke their "torches of freedom" as they walked in the [[Easter Sunday Parade]] in New York. He was very careful when picking women to march because "while they should be good looking, they should not look too model-y" and he hired his own photographers to make sure that good pictures were taken and then published around the world.&lt;ref name=Brandt2007-84-85&gt;Brandt, Allan M. (2007). ''The Cigarette Century''. New York: Basic Books, pp. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, the [[Sturmabteilung]], the paramilitary wing of the [[Nazi Party]], founded a cigarette company as a way to raise funds and make itself less financially dependent on the party leadership. SA members were expected to smoke only [[Sturm-Zigaretten|SA brands]].&lt;ref name="Proctor"&gt;Robert N. Proctor, ''The Nazi War on Cancer'', pp. 234–237.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that coercion was used to promote the sale of these cigarettes. Through this scheme, a typical SA unit earned hundreds of [[Reichsmarks]] each month.&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;Thomas D. Grant, ''Stormtroopers and Crisis in the Nazi Movement'', p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The brand also promoted political ideas, with sets of [[cigarette cards]] showing historical army uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Goodman and Jane Martin, ''Gender, Colonialism and Education'', p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical concerns ===
{{quotebox|align=left|width=35%|title=Old joke|quote =Of course it is perfectly easy to give up smoking.

Skyrocketing European lung cancer rates drew attention from doctors in the twenties and thirties.&lt;ref name=1932_habit&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1932.tb04849.x |oclc=79886767 |title=The Cigarette Habit |journal=Addiction |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=1–27 |year=1932 |last1=Rolleston |first1=J. D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lung cancer had been a vanishingly rare disease. Before 1900, there were only 140 documented cases worldwide.&lt;ref name=nazi_policy/&gt; Then, suddenly, lung cancer became a leading cause of death in many countries (a status it retains to this day).&lt;ref name=nazi_policy/&gt;&lt;ref name=media_role/&gt;{{rp|4}}{{better citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Initially, suspicion was cast on causes including road tar, car exhaust, the [[1918 flu pandemic]], racial mixing, and the use of [[chemical weapons in World War I]]. However, in 1929, a statistical analysis strongly linking lung cancer to smoking was published by [[Fritz Lickint]] of [[Dresden]]. He did a [[retrospective cohort study]] showing that those with lung cancer were, disproportionately, smokers. He also found that men got lung cancer at several times the rate of women, and that, in countries where more women smoked, the difference was much smaller.&lt;ref name=nazi_policy/&gt; In 1932, a study in [[Poland]] came to the same conclusion, pointing out that the geographic and gender patterns of Polish lung cancer deaths matched those of smoking, but no other suggested cause, such as industry or cars (rare in Poland at the time).&lt;ref name=nazi_policy/&gt;

The medical community was criticized for [[health effects of tobacco#history|its slow response]] to these findings. One 1932 paper attributed the slow response to smoking being common among doctors, as well as the general population.&lt;ref name=1932_habit/&gt; Some temperance activists had continued to attack tobacco as expensive, addictive, and leading to petty theft. In the thirties, they also began to publicize the medical findings.&lt;ref name=australian_temperance/&gt; There was popular awareness these dangers of smoking (see accompanying quote).

=== World War II ===

Cigarettes were included in American soldiers' [[C-rations]], since many tobacco companies sent the soldiers cigarettes for free. Cigarette sales reached an all-time high at this point, as cigarette companies were not only able to get soldiers addicted, but specific brands also found a new loyal group of customers as soldiers who smoked their cigarettes returned from the war.&lt;ref name=Randall_history&gt;{{cite web|author=Vernellia R.

A faction of the [[Nazi Party]] [[Anti-tobacco movement in Nazi Germany|opposed tobacco use]].&lt;ref name=not_simple/&gt; The ''Institute for Tobacco Hazards Research'' was founded.

== 1950–70 ==
Until the 1970s, most tobacco advertising was legal in the United States and most European nations. In the 1940s and 50s, tobacco was a major radio sponsor; in the 1950s and 60s, they became predominantly involved in television.&lt;ref name=media_role/&gt;{{rp|100}} In the United States, in the 1950s and 1960s, cigarette brands frequently sponsored television shows—notably ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' and ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''. Brand jingles were commonly used on radio and television. Major cigarette companies would advertise their brands in popular TV shows such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', which were watched by many children and teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/tc.3.2.134 |jstor=20207023 |pmc=1759332 |title=Promises, promises: Self-regulation of US cigarette broadcast advertising in the 1960s |journal=Tobacco Control |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=134–44 |year=1994 |last1=Pollay |first1=Richard W }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, after facing much pressure from the public, The Cigarette Advertising Code was created by the tobacco companies, which prohibited advertising directed to youth.&lt;ref name="John W.

Advertising continued to use celebrities and famous athletes. Popular comedian [[Bob Hope]] was used to advertise for cigarette companies.&lt;ref name="John W.

Racial marketing strategies changed during the fifties, with more attention paid to racial [[market segmentation]]. The [[civil rights movement]] lead to the rise of African-American publications, such as ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]''. This helped tobacco companies to target separate marketing messages by race.&lt;ref name=media_role&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute| pages = 684| last1 = Davis| first1 = Ronald M.| last2 = Gilpin| first2 = Elizabeth A.| last3 = Loken| first3 = Barbara| last4 = Viswanath| first4 = K.| last5 = Wakefield| first5 = Melanie A.| title = The role of the media in promoting and reducing tobacco use| series = National Cancer Institute tobacco control monograph series| date = 2008 |url=https://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps119239/m19_complete.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|57}} Tobacco companies supported civil rights organizations, and advertised their support heavily. Industry motives were, according to their public statements, to support civil rights causes; according to an independent review of internal tobacco industry documents, they were "to increase African American tobacco use, to use African Americans as a frontline force to defend industry policy positions, and to defuse tobacco control efforts". There had been internal resistance to tobacco sponsorship, and some organizations are now rejecting nicotine funding as a matter of policy.&lt;ref name=leadership_sponsorship&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/tc.11.4.336 |pmid=12432159 |pmc=1747674 |title=African American leadership groups: Smoking with the enemy |journal=Tobacco Control |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=336–45 |year=2002 |last1=Yerger |first1=V B |last2=Malone |first2=R.

Tobacco companies supported civil rights organizations, and advertised their support heavily. They also hired key figures in the civil rights movement. Industry motives were, according to their public statements, to support civil rights causes; according to an independent review of internal tobacco industry documents, they were "to increase African American tobacco use, to use African Americans as a frontline force to defend industry policy positions, and to defuse tobacco control efforts". Defenses of the industry mounted with the help of vulnerable groups include "our critics are elitist and racist". Some organizations are now rejecting nicotine funding as a matter of policy.&lt;ref name=leadership_sponsorship/&gt;

[[File:A Frank Statement.png|thumb|''A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers'' ([[:Wikisource:A Frank Statement|fulltext on Wikisource]]) denied health effects]]
In 1954, tobacco companies ran the ad "[[A Frank Statement]]." The ad was the first in a [[disinformation]] campaign, disputing reports that smoking cigarettes could cause lung cancer and had other dangerous health effects.&lt;ref name=frank_statement&gt;[http://www.tobacco.org/Documents/dd/ddfrankstatement.html Daily Doc: TI, Jan 4, 1954: The 'Frank Statement' of 1954]. Tobacco.org. 30 September 2000. Retrieved 17 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It also referred to "research of recent years",&lt;ref name=frank_statement/&gt; although solid statistical evidence of a link between smoking and lung cancer had first been published 25 years earlier.&lt;ref name=nazi_policy/&gt;

Prior to 1964, many of the cigarette companies advertised their brand by claiming that their product did not have serious health risks. A couple of examples would be "Play safe with Philip Morris" and "More doctors smoke Camels". Such claims were made both to increase the sales of their product and to combat the increasing public knowledge of smoking's negative health effects.&lt;ref name="John W. Richards 1996 pp. 297"&gt;John W. Richards, Jr., Joe B. Tye and Paul M. Fischer, "The Tobacco Industry's Code of Advertising in the United States: Myth and Reality", ''Tobacco Control'', Vol. 5, (Winter 1996), pp. 297&lt;/ref&gt; A 1953 industry document claims that the survey brand preference among doctors was done on doctors entering a conference, and asked (among a great many camouflage questions) what brand they had on them; marketers had previously placed packs of their Camels in doctors' hotel rooms before the doctors arrived,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tobacco.stanford.edu/tobacco_main/images_body.php?token1=fm_img18905.php|title=Untitled Document|website=tobacco.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; which probably biassed the results.

In 1964, ''[[Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the United States]]'' was published. It was based on over 7,000 scientific articles that linked tobacco use with cancer and other diseases. This report led to laws requiring warning labels on tobacco products and to restrictions on tobacco advertisements. As these began to come into force, tobacco marketing became more subtle (for instance, the [[Joe Camel]] campaign resulted in increased awareness and uptake of smoking among children).&lt;ref name=While_1995&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=While D, Kelly S, Huang W, Charlton A |title=Cigarette advertising and onset of smoking in children: questionnaire survey |journal=BMJ |volume=313 |issue=7054 |pages=398–9 |date=17 August 1996|pmid=8761227 |pmc=2351819 |doi=10.1136/bmj.313.7054.398}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, restrictions did have an effect on adult quit rates, with its use declining to the point that by 2004, nearly half of all Americans who had ever smoked had quit.&lt;ref name=CDC_decline_2005&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cigarette smoking among adults—United States, 2004 |journal=MMWR Morb.

The period after nicotine advertising restrictions were brought in is characterised by ingenious circumvention of progressively stricter regulations. The industry continued to dispute medical research: denying, for instance, that nicotine was addictive, while deliberately spiking their cigarettes with additional nicotine to make them more addictive.&lt;ref name=NYT_deadly/&gt;

Advertising restrictions typically shift advertising spending to unrestricted media. Banned on television, ads move to print; banned in all conventional media, ads shift to sponsorships; banned as in-store advertising and packaging, advertising shifts to [[shill]] (undisclosed) marketing reps, sponsored online content, [[viral marketing]], and other [[stealth marketing]] techniques.&lt;ref name=media_role/&gt;{{rp|272–280}}

Another method of evading restrictions is to sell less-regulated nicotine products instead of the ones for which advertising is more regulated. For instance, while TV ads of cigarettes are banned in the United States, similar TV ads of e-cigarettes are not.&lt;ref name=exposure_rising&gt;{{Cite web| last = Reuters| title = More U.S. teens seeing e-cigarette ads| website = Business Insider| accessdate = 2018-05-18| url = http://www.businessinsider.com/r-more-us-teens-seeing-e-cigarette-ads-2018-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most effective media are usually banned first, meaning advertisers need to spend more money to addict the same number of people.&lt;ref name=media_role/&gt;{{rp|272}} Comprehensive bans can make it impossible to effectively substitute other forms of advertising, leading to actual falls in consumption.&lt;ref name=media_role/&gt;{{rp|272–280}} However, skillful use of allowed media can increase advertising exposure; the exposure of U.S. children to nicotine advertising is increasing as of 2018.&lt;ref name="exposure_rising"/&gt;

[[File:VeteransStadium1986.jpg|thumb|[[Veterans Stadium]], [[Philadelphia]] in 1986; a ban on TV and radio ads meant more reliance on ads at sports venues, which would appear on television]]
In the US, sport and event sponsorships and billboards became important in the 1970s and 80s, due to TV and radio advertising bans. Sponsors benefit from placing their advertising at sporting events, naming events after themselves, and recruiting political support from sporting agencies. In the 1980s and 90s, these sponsorships were banned in the US and many other countries. Spending has since shifted to point-of-sale advertising and promotional allowances (where legal), direct mail advertising, and Internet advertising. [[Stealth marketing]] is also becoming more common,&lt;ref name=media_role/&gt;{{rp|100}} partly to offset mistrust of the tobacco industry.&lt;ref name=media_role/&gt;{{rp|Ch.6&amp;7}}

Nicotine use is frequently shown in movies. While academics had long speculated that there was paid [[product placement]], it was not until internal industry documents were released that there was hard evidence of such practices.&lt;ref name=media_role/&gt;{{rp|363–364}} The documents show that in the 1980s and 1990s, cigarettes were shown in return for ≤six-figure (US$) sponsorship deals. More money was paid for a star actor to be shown using nicotine. While this sponsorship is now banned in some countries, it is unclear whether the bans are effective, as such deals are generally not publicized or investigated.&lt;ref name=media_role/&gt;{{rp|401}}

Smokers in movies are generally healthier, more successful, and more racially privileged than actual smokers. Health effects, including coughing and addiction, are shown or mentioned in only a few percent of cases, and are less likely to be mentioned in films targeted at younger viewers.&lt;ref name=media_role/&gt;{{rp|372–374}}

In the nineties, internet access expanded in many countries; the web is a major medium for nicotine advertising.

Both [[Google]] and [[Microsoft]] have policies that prohibit the promotion of tobacco products on their advertising networks.&lt;ref name=microsoft&gt;[http://advertising.microsoft.com/learning-center/best-practices/ad-content-guidelines/#alcohol_tobacco Advertising.microsoft.com].

Adwords.google.com.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some tobacco retailers are able to circumvent these policies. On Facebook, unpaid content, created and sponsored by tobacco companies, is widely used to advertise nicotine-containing products, with photos of the products, "buy now" buttons and a lack of age restrictions, in contravention of ineffectively enforced Facebook policies.&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"&gt;{{Cite web| last1 = April 5| first1 = Ashley Welch CBS News| last2 = 2018| last3 = Pm| first3 = 5:02| title = Facebook is used to promote tobacco, despite policies against it, study finds| accessdate = 2018-05-18| url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-tobacco-products-promotion-sales-study/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Affairs"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Affairs| first = By Amy Jeter Hansen Amy Jeter Hansen is a digital media specialist for the medical school's Office of Communication &amp; Public| title = Tobacco products promoted on Facebook despite policies| website = News Center| accessdate = 2018-05-18| url = http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2018/04/tobacco-products-promoted-on-facebook-despite-policies.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Hansen| first = Author Amy Jeter| title = Despite policies, tobacco products marketed on Facebook, Stanford researchers find| website = Scope| accessdate = 2018-05-18| date = 2018-04-05| url = https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2018/04/05/despite-policies-tobacco-products-marketed-on-facebook/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}}

==Controversies==

'''Accusation of visa fraud'''&lt;br&gt;
In 2011, Infosys was accused of committing [[visa fraud]] by using [[B visa|B-1]] (visitor) visas for work requiring [[H-1B]] (work) visas. The allegations were initially made by an American employee of Infosys in an internal complaint. He subsequently sued the company, claiming that he was harassed and sidelined after speaking out. Although that case was dismissed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/us/alabama-judge-dismisses-infosys-whistle-blower-suit.html |title=Judge dismisses Infosys suit |work=The New York Times |date=20 August 2012 |accessdate=29 October 2012 |first=Julia |last=Preston}}&lt;/ref&gt; it along with another similar case,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443537404577578653130863044 "Former Employee Sues Infosys"], 9 August 2012, ''The Wall Street Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/content/271636/infosys-slashed-80-my-portfolio.html "‘Infosys slashed 80% of my portfolio’"], Shayan Ghosh, 14 August 2012, ''Deccan Herald''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/infosys-says-settles-whistleblower-satya-dev-tripuraneni-visa-fraud-lawsuit/1045403 "Infosys says settles whistleblower..."], 14 Dec 2012, ''The Indian Express''&lt;/ref&gt; brought the allegations to the notice of the US authorities&amp;nbsp;— and the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] and a [[federal grand jury]] started investigating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Thibodeau |first=Patrick |title=Whistleblower to continue helping U.S. Infosys probe |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9230419/Whistleblower_to_continue_helping_U.S._Infosys_probe |work=Computerworld|accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, Infosys agreed to settle the civil suit with US authorities by paying US$34 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-10-31/software-services/43558764_1_b-1-visas-bangalore-based-infosys-infosys-statement |title=Infosys to pay $34m fine within 10 days. settlement not to affect future visas |newspaper=The Times of India |date=31 October 2013 |accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infosys refused to admit guilt and stressed that it only agreed to pay the fine to avoid the nuisance of 'prolonged litigation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.firstpost.com/business/infosys-doesnt-admit-to-guilt-but-will-pay-34-mn-us-visa-fine-1203579.html |title=Infosys doesn’t admit to guilt, but will pay $34 mn US visa fine |newspaper=First Post |date=31 October 2013 |accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its statement the company said "As reflected in the settlement, Infosys denies and disputes any claims of systemic visa fraud, misuse of visas for competitive advantage, or immigration abuse. Those claims are assertions that remain unproven".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-10-30/software-services/43526427_1_infosys-visa-programmes-immigration-abuse |title=Infosys settles visa fraud investigation, pays $34m |newspaper=The Times of India |date=30 October 2013 |accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Displacement of American workers at Southern California Edison and Disney'''&lt;br&gt;
In 2015, the [[United States Department of Labor]] began an investigation of Infosys after claims were made that the company used workers with H-1B visas to replace workers at [[Disney]] and [[Southern California Edison]].  Florida Sen. [[Bill Nelson]] also asked the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] to investigate reports of layoffs at Disney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department Of Labor Launches Investigation Into H-1B Visa Program | url=http://dailycaller.com/2015/06/11/department-of-labor-launches-investigation-into-h-1b-visa-program/#ixzz41VXLB9M2||work=Daily Caller|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation did not find any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lynch|first1=Sarah|title=Infosys says cleared in U.S. visa probe by Labor Department|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/infosys-h1b-probes-idUSL1N11A0TQ20150908|website=Reuters|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Interim Management''' ('''IIM''') is a [[United Kingdom|UK]] based [[professional body]] for those working in [[Interim Management]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and internationally.

== History ==
The '''Institute of Interim Management''' was formed and launched in April 2001, with the encouragement and support of the Interim Management Association (IMA) and the [[Chartered Management Institute]] (CMI).&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Dennis; Daniell, Ian; (2005), ''Interim Management,'' pp. 148-149, {{ISBN|0-9549742-1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until August 2002, the '''IIM''' operated as a Special Interest Group through the [[Chartered Management Institute|CMI]] infrastructure. Given the '''IIM'''’s growing need for greater emphasis on its own specialist area of management, and to facilitate a higher profile for [[Interim Management]] within industry and commerce, in August 2002, by mutual agreement with the [[Chartered Management Institute|CMI]], the '''IIM''' pursued an independent status.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Dennis; Daniell, Ian; (2005), ''Interim Management,'' pp. 148-149, {{ISBN|0-9549742-1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Interim Management, History of the Institute of Interim Management (2012). http://www.iim.org.uk/about/history-of-the-iim 1/1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2522">An '''interconnect agreement''' is a business [[contract]] between telecommunications organizations for the purpose of interconnecting their networks and exchanging telecommunications traffic. Interconnect agreements are found both in the [[public switched telephone network]] and the [[Internet]].

In the public switched telephone network, an interconnect agreement invariably involves settlement fees based on [[Calling party|call source]] and [[Called party|destination]], connection times and duration, when these fees do not cancel out between operators. 

On the Internet, where the concept of a "[[telephone call|call]]" is generally hard to define, settlement-free [[peering]] and [[Internet transit]] are common forms of interconnection. A contract for interconnection within the Internet is usually called a [[peering agreement]].

Interconnect agreements are typically complex [[contractual agreement]]s involving payment schemes and schedules, coordination of [[Policy-based routing|routing policies]], [[acceptable use policy|acceptable use policies]], traffic balancing requirements, technical standards, coordination of network operations, dispute resolution, etc. Legal and regulatory requirements are often an issue. For example, network operators may be forced by law to interconnect with their competitors. In the United States, the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] mandated methods of interconnection and the compensation models for doing so.

The '''Lavin Entrepreneurship Center''' is housed within the [[San Diego State University College of Business Administration|College of Business Administration]] at [[San Diego State University]] (SDSU) and offers a blend of university curriculum and experiential learning opportunities to students across the SDSU campus. The Center provides academic curriculum through both a major and minor in entrepreneurship and hands-on learning opportunities through various co-curricular programs. The Lavin Center is a resource for SDSU students that provides an entrepreneurial foundation and encourages innovation.&lt;ref name="aboutthelavinentrepreneurshipcenter"&gt;[http://lavincenter.sdsu.edu/about/ "About the Lavin Entrepreneurship Center"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission of the Lavin Entrepreneurship Center is "to inspire entrepreneurship campus-wide and enable students to develop the entrepreneurial competencies necessary to compete in the global economy."&lt;ref&gt;http://lavincenter.sdsu.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
San Diego State University management professor emeritus, Dr. Daryl Mitton, formed the University’s original Entrepreneurial Management Center (EMC) in 1980. In 1986, the EMC received its first funding and the program has been dedicated to entrepreneurial research and development since.&lt;ref name="emccelebrates25years"&gt;[http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~cba/news-online/11-July/f.html "EMC Celebrates 25 Years"] College of Business Administration News. Retrieved November 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Entrepreneurial Management Center was renamed to honor [[Leonard H. Lavin|Dr. Leonard H. Lavin]], founder of the [[Alberto-Culver]] company and a longtime supporter of the Center. Dr. Lavin has been actively involved with the Center as a guest lecturer and mentor since 2005.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurialmanagementcenternamed"&gt;[http://newscenter.sdsu.edu/sdsu_newscenter/news.aspx?s=73955 "Entrepreneurial Management Center Named"] Business Administration Story. Retrieved November 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Entrepreneurship Curriculum ==
The SDSU College of Business Administration works closely with the Lavin Entrepreneurship Center to offer a curriculum designed to meet the needs of students with an interest in entrepreneurship. The blend of academic and experiential learning is geared to provide students with a theoretical foundation as well as build and reinforce lifelong skills necessary to succeed as an entrepreneur.&lt;ref name="lavincurriculum"&gt;[http://lavincenter.sdsu.edu/curriculum/ "Lavin Curriculum"] Retrieved November 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Undergraduate Program ===

The Undergraduate Entrepreneurship curriculum is designed so that students who wish to have deep immersion in entrepreneurship can do so through the specialization, while students – from both a business and non-business background – seeking some exposure to the entrepreneurial mindset can do so through the minor.

* '''Specialization in Entrepreneurship:''' The Specialization in Entrepreneurship is crafted specifically for Management majors in the College of Business Administration. This specialization complements the managing theories and strategies in the core classes with an innovational and an entrepreneurial mindset. In this specialization, students have the opportunity to explore the ins-and-outs of family business, franchising, international and social ventures, as well as creativity and innovation.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurshipspecialization"&gt;[http://lavincenter.sdsu.edu/curriculum/management_specialization.php "Entrepreneurship Specialization"] Retrieved November 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Minor in Entrepreneurship:''' The Entrepreneurship Minor is open to all students enrolled at SDSU, regardless of academic major. Through the entrepreneurship minor, both business and non-business students have the opportunity to learn how to take an idea, evaluate it, and potentially turn it into a real business.

=== Graduate Program ===

The Lavin Entrepreneurship Center supports the SDSU graduate program in entrepreneurship and acts as a physical hub on campus as well as a virtual web community that allows entrepreneurs, investors, and service providers to partner with one another and provide resources for start-up companies.

The case study lead curriculum is taught in an environment where students work in teams. Students are encouraged to think strategically, learn how to assess ideas and solutions, build appropriate financial and business models, and develop the right management and marketing strategies. The faculty in the program are a blend of tenured professors and industry experienced lecturers to provide a balance of theory and application.&lt;ref name="lavingraduateprogram"&gt;[http://lavincenter.sdsu.edu/curriculum/grad.php "Lavin Graduate Program"] Retrieved November 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5422">In the United Kingdom, a limited '''partnership''' consists of:

*one or more persons called [[general partner]]s, who are liable for all debts and obligations of the firm; and
*one or more persons called limited partners, who contribute a sum/sums of money as capital, or property valued at a stated amount. Limited partners are not liable for the debts and obligations of the firm beyond the amount contributed.

Limited partners may not:
*draw out or receive back any part of their contributions to the partnership during its lifetime; or
*take part in the management of the business or have power to bind the firm.

If they do, they become liable for all the debts and obligations of the firm up to the amount drawn out or received back or incurred while taking part in the management, as the case may be.

Generally speaking, an individual or a legal body such as a company may be a partner in a limited partnership, either as a general or as a limited partner. A person cannot be both a general and a limited partner at the same time. 

==Registration process==

A ''limited partnership'' must be registered under the [[Limited Partnership Act 1907]]. To register, you must deliver a statement (Form LP5), signed by all the partners, to the [[Registrar of Companies]]. Partnerships whose principal place of business is situated [or proposed to be situated] in England and Wales should send their forms to the Cardiff office; those whose principal place of business is situated or proposed to be situated in Scotland to the Edinburgh office; and those whose principal place of business is situated or proposed to be situated in Northern Ireland to the Belfast office. 

The information supplied on the form must include the following:

#the firm's name;
#the general nature of the business;
#the address of the principal place of business;
#the full name of each partner, listing general and limited partners separately;
#the term (if any) for which the partnership is entered into;
#the date of its commencement;
#a statement that the partnership is limited and the description of every partner as such; and
#the sum contributed by each limited partner, and whether it is paid in cash or otherwise.

If all these particulars are in order, the Registrar will issue a certificate of registration, subject to the acceptability of the name. The Registrar will advise against the use of any name which is the 'same as' the name of a limited company, other legal body, or another limited partnership already on the register. In addition, the names of limited partnerships are controlled by the [[Business Names Act 1985]].

The general partners are responsible for the delivery of Forms LP5 and LP6 whether or not the preparation of the documents was delegated to accountants or to anyone else. 

The Limited Partnership Act 1907 provides for the imposition of penalties for various defaults in carrying out the requirements of the Acts and for failing to send to the Registrar the required forms. 

Notice of any arrangement or transaction under which a general partner will become a limited partner in the firm must be advertised in the [[London Gazette|London]], [[Edinburgh Gazette|Edinburgh]] or [[Belfast Gazette|Belfast]] Gazette, as the case may be. Notice must also be advertised in the Gazette of any arrangement or transaction under which a limited partner's share in the firm will be assigned to somebody else. Until this is done these arrangements or transactions have no effect.

==Limit on the number of partners==

A limited partnership may not normally consist of more than 20 [[person]]s. However, under section 717 of the [[Companies Act 1985]] there are a number of exceptions to this rule, including:

*a partnership carrying on practice as solicitors and consisting of persons each of whom is a solicitor;
*a partnership carrying on practice as accountants where the partnership is eligible for appointment as a company auditor;
*a partnership carrying on business as members of a recognised stock exchange and consisting of persons each of whom is a member of that exchange;
*a partnership carrying on business as surveyors, auctioneers, valuers, estate agents, land agents, or estate managers and consisting of persons of whom at least three-quarters are members of the [[Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors]] and of whom not more than one-quarter are limited partners;
*a partnership carrying on business as insurance brokers and consisting of persons each of whom is a registered insurance broker or an enrolled body corporate. (For the meaning of 'registered insurance broker' and 'enrolled body corporate' see section 29(1) of the [[Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977]].);and
*a partnership which is a [[collective investment scheme]] the operator of which, or the manager of the investments of which, is an authorised person under Part IV of the [[Financial Services and Markets Act 2000]] or a [[European Economic Area]] firm or a Treaty firm with permission under the Act to operate the scheme or manage the investments.

According to Indian Partnership Act of 1932, Section 4, "  Partnership is defined as the relation between two or more persons who have agreed to share the profits of business run by all or any one of them acting for all ".

[[Image:Mario Pergolini Chevening TALKS 2013.jpg|250px|thumb|Mario Daniel Pergolini]]
'''Mario Daniel Pergolini''' (born July 3, 1964, in [[Rojas, Buenos Aires]]) is an [[Argentine]] journalist, media producer and businessman, best known as the former main host of the [[television]] show ''[[Caiga Quien Caiga]]'' (''CQC'') broadcast on Argentina's [[Telefe]].

He started working at the Rock &amp; Pop radio of Buenos Aires. He moved to TV as a secondary figure at [[Pepe Eliaschev]]'s ''Cable a tierra'' and then [[Juan Alberto Badía]]'s ''Badía y Compañía''. In 1989 he hosted ''Rock and pop TV'' together with other radio figures. Probably his first successful TV shows were the teenager-rebel program ''La TV ataca'' (1991&amp;ndash;1993) and ''Hacelo por mí'' (1992), but it was CQC (first aired in 1995) the most successful of them all.

Pergolini is the Argentine TV host seen introducing the [[Ramones]] in the [[documentary film]] ''[[End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones]]'' (2003).

In 1994 he created, together with partner Diego Guebel, the ''[[Cuatro Cabezas]]'' (or ''4K'') TV production company, which is now one of the three most important media holdings in Argentina. He still hosts CQC and his radio show ''Cuál es?'' at [[Rock &amp; Pop (Chilean radio)|Rock &amp; Pop]].

The CQC format has been sold to several countries (Chile, Brazil, Mexico, France, Italy, Spain, and Israel). The [[Israel]] TV version (anchored by [[Avri Gilad]]) did not catch with Israeli audiences and was discontinued after half a season.

Pergolini retired from ''CQC'' (and, as he said, from television) on 15 December 2008. His last episode did not include any special retrospective, but Pergolini criticized Telefe's management on the air (arguing that they cannot threaten him now) and joked with his colleagues Eduardo de la Puente (also retiring) and Juan Di Natale, who was still hosting ''CQC'' in 2009. [http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1081326&amp;pid=5534733&amp;toi=6266]

At late 2011, the rumors about the end of Pergolini's position at "Cual Es?", the radio show that he hosted since 1989, and his leaving the Rock &amp; Pop radio (where he was the main figure) got strong presence in the media and was encouraged by his co workers at the radio. [http://teleshow.infobae.com/notas/614109-El-nuevo-proyecto-laboral-de-Mario-Pergolini.html]

Finally he left both positions (the show and the radio) and started up a new project: Vorterix, the continuation of the website of his radio show "cual es?" which already had the url vorterix.com since early 2011. Pergolini is leading this project which is integrated by a radio station (Vorterix Rock 103.1 FM), a Concert hall placed in the old "Teatro de Colegiales" and a website where the shows of the radio and the stage streams online in audio and video in HD quality. 

The radio/show venue/website was officially launched at May 25, 2012 with a big event with live shows inside and outside the new "Vorterix Theater". But the transmissions really began at December 2011, and so did the new Pergolini's Show at Vorterix Rock, which started airing on February 1st 2012.

'''''Multipliers: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter''''' is a business book by [[Liz Wiseman]] and [[Greg McKeown (author)|Greg McKeown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Logan|first=Dave|title=How to Make Your Employees Smarter|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-40142066/how-to-make-your-employees-smarter/|accessdate=1 July 2013|newspaper=CBS News|date=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published on June 15, 2010 through [[Harper Collins]] and looks into different forms of leadership and how they can either help or hinder the people they are managing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coach: Good Managers Appreciate Others' Genius|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128401148|publisher=NPR|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
In the book Wiseman and McKeown look at various types of leaders and identify two different types of leaders, Diminishers and Multipliers. Multipliers are leaders who encourage growth and creativity from their workers, while Diminishers are those who hinder and otherwise keep their employees' productivity at a minimum. The authors give what they consider to be solutions and guidance to the issues they bring up in the book.

==Reception==
Critical reception was mostly positive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: Multipliers: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter|url=http://www.booklistonline.com/Multipliers-How-the-Best-Leaders-Make-Everyone-Smarter-Liz-Wiseman/pid=4143857|publisher=Booklist|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McDonough-Taub|first=Gloria|title=Top Books: Multipliers|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/38662075|accessdate=1 July 2013|newspaper=CNBC|date=19 Aug 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Gulf News]] commenting that it would help "usher in a decade focused less on stuff and more on people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harnish|first=Verne|title=What kind of a leader are you?|url=http://gulfnews.com/business/opinion/what-kind-of-a-leader-are-you-1.641615|publisher=Gulf News|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Publishers Weekly]] gave a mixed review, stating that the "breadth of the material is better suited for a lengthy article than a full business book, and the effort to stretch it into a longer work diminishes the meaningful research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-fiction Review: Multipliers: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-196439-8|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40334">{{Contract law}}

In [[contract]] [[law]], a '''non-compete clause''' (often '''NCC'''), or '''covenant not to compete''' ('''CNC'''), is a clause under which one party (usually an employee) agrees not to enter into or start a similar profession or trade in competition against another party (usually the employer). Some courts refer to these as "restrictive covenants." As a contract provision, a CNC is bound by traditional contract requirements including the [[consideration]] doctrine.

The use of such clauses is premised on the possibility that upon their termination or resignation, an employee might begin working for a competitor or starting a business, and gain competitive advantage by exploiting [[Confidentiality|confidential information]] about their former employer's operations or [[trade secret]]s, or sensitive information such as customer/client lists, business practices, upcoming products, and [[marketing]] plans.

However, an over-broad CNC may prevent an employee from working elsewhere at all. [[English law#Common law|English common law]] originally held any such constraint to be unenforceable under the [[public policy doctrine]].&lt;ref name="Alger52"&gt;''Alger'', 36 Mass. at 52 (1837).&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary case law permits exceptions, but generally will only enforce CNCs to the extent necessary to protect the employer. Most [[jurisdiction]]s in which such contracts have been examined by the [[court]]s have deemed CNCs to be legally binding so long as the clause contains reasonable limitations as to the geographical area and time period in which an employee of a company may not compete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oblon|first1=David|title=Maryland Federal Court Voids Non-Compete Even After "Blue Penciling" It. (2012)|url=http://www.albo-oblon.com/2012/12/05/maryland-federal-court-voids-non-compete-even-after-blue-penciling-it/|website=albo-oblon.com|publisher=Albo-Oblon L.L.P.|accessdate=7 July 2014|ref=MarylandBluePencil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent to which non-compete clauses are legally allowed varies per jurisdiction. For example, the state of [[California]] in the [[United States]] invalidates non-compete-clauses for all but equity stakeholders in the sale of business interests.&lt;ref name="CalBPC16600-1"&gt;Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code §§ 16600, 16601&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As far back as ''[[Dyer's Case]]'' in 1414, English [[common law]] chose not to enforce non-compete agreements because of their nature as [[Restraint of trade|restraints on trade]].{{sfnp|Blake|1960|p=625}} That ban remained unchanged until 1621, when a restriction that was limited to a specific geographic location was found to be an enforceable exception to the previously absolute rule. Almost a hundred years later, the exception became the rule with the 1711 watershed case of ''[[Mitchel v Reynolds]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mitchel v. Reynolds]]'', 24 Eng. Rep. 347 (Q.B. 1711)&lt;/ref&gt; which established the modern framework for the analysis of the enforceability of non-compete agreements.&lt;ref&gt;C. L. Fisk, [[Working Knowledge: Trade Secrets, Restrictive Covenants in Employment, and the Rise of Corporate Intellectual Property]], 1800-1920, 52 Hastings Law Journal no. 2, 453-54 (2001); ''see also'' ''Alger'', 36 Mass. at 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
The majority of U.S. states recognize and enforce various forms of non-compete agreements. A few states, such as California, [[Montana]], [[North Dakota]], and [[Oklahoma]], totally ban non-compete agreements for employees, or prohibit all non-compete agreements except in limited circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How do Non-Compete Agreements Work|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/employment-and-labor-law/how-do-non-compete-agreements-work|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, non-compete agreements have been popular among companies with employees working in states where they are allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study Finds Many Companies Require Non-Compete Clauses For Low-Wage Workers|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/11/07/501053238/study-finds-many-companies-require-non-compete-clauses-for-low-wage-workers|website=All Things Considered|publisher=Michigan Radio|accessdate=11 June 2017|date=7 November 2016}} (Approximately 18 percent of the U.S. workforce is bound by a non-compete agreement.)&lt;/ref&gt; They are very common among commercial [[radio station]]s and [[television station]]s, especially for [[Radio personality|radio personalities]] and [[Celebrity|television personalities]] working for [[media conglomerate]]s. For example, if a radio or television personality quits, is laid off or fired from one station in the [[media market]] they work in, they cannot work for another competing station in the same market until their contract expires with their former employing station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tompkins|first1=Al|title=New York Limits ‘Non-Compete’ Contracts for Broadcasters|url=https://www.poynter.org/2008/new-york-limits-non-compete-contracts-for-broadcasters/90527/|accessdate=11 June 2017|agency=Poynter|date=7 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, non-compete clauses cover 18 percent of United States workers, and this is down from 38 percent of workers. While more prevalent among higher-wage workers, non-competes covered 14 percent of workers without college degrees in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Brien |first=Matt |url=https://www.washingtonposthttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/18/even-janitors-have-noncompetes-now-nobody-is-safe/ |title=Even janitors have noncompetes now. Nobody is safe. |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2018-10-18 |accessdate=2018-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===
Non-compete agreements are automatically void as a matter of law in [[California]], except for a small set of specific situations expressly authorized by statute.&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code § 16600 (“Except as provided in this chapter, every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void.”); see ''e.g.'' ''Edwards v. [[Arthur Andersen LLP]]'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/44C4t937.htm 44 Cal. 4th 937] (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; They were outlawed by the original [[California Civil Code]] in 1872 (Civ. Code, former § 1673).&lt;ref name=kaifulee/&gt;

==== Out of state agreements are not enforceable ====
A leading court decision discussing the conflict between California law and the laws of other states is the 1998 decision ''Application Group, Inc. v. Hunter Group, Inc.''&lt;ref name=hunter&gt;[http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA4/61CA4t881.htm 61 Cal. App. 4th 881] (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Hunter'', a [[Maryland]] company required that its Maryland-based employee agree to a one-year non-compete agreement. The contract stated that it was governed by and to be construed according to Maryland law. A Maryland employee then left to work for a competitor in California. When the new California employer sued in California state court to invalidate the covenant not to compete, the California court agreed and ruled that the non-compete provision was invalid and not enforceable in California. Business and Professions Code Section 16600 reflects a “strong public policy of the State of California” and the state has a strong interest in applying its law and protecting its businesses so that they can hire the employees of their choosing. California law is thus applicable to non-California employees seeking employment in California.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

Whether California courts are required by the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]] to enforce equitable judgments from courts of other states, having [[personal jurisdiction]] over the defendant, that enjoin competition or are contrary to important public interests in California is an issue that has not yet been decided.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''EMC Corp. v. Donatelli'', Suffolk Superior Court, Civil Action 09-1727-BLS2 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exceptions — valid non-compete agreements in California====
There are limited situations where a reasonable non-compete agreement may be valid in California.
# Where the owner of a business is selling the entire business, or is selling the [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] in the business, the seller may be bound by a non-compete clause.&lt;ref name="CalBPC16601"&gt;Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code § 16601.&lt;/ref&gt;
# When there is a dissolution or disassociation of a [[partnership]].&lt;ref name="CalBPC16602"&gt;Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code § 16602.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Where there is a dissolution of a [[limited liability company]].&lt;ref name="CalBPC16602.5"&gt;Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code § 16602.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florida===
The enforceability of non-compete agreements in the state of [[Florida]] is quite common. Some law firms build their law practice around these agreements and represent employees, employers and potential new employers of an employee currently bound by a non-compete agreement. The agreement is not allowed to be overly broad and generally difficult to enforce if it is for more than two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=State of Florida|title=542.335 - Valid Restraints of Trade|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0500-0599/0542/Sections/0542.335.html|website=Online Sunshine|publisher=State of Florida|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Florida courts will rarely refuse to enforce a non-compete agreement due to its length or geographic scope. Instead, under Florida law, courts are required to "[[Blue pencil doctrine|blue pencil]]" an impermissibly broad or lengthy non-compete agreement to make it reasonable within the limits of Fla. Stat. § 542.335.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vanko|first1=Kenneth|title=A Quick State-By-State Guide on the Blue-Pencil Rule|url=http://www.non-competes.com/2009/01/quick-state-by-state-guide-on-blue.html|website=Legal Developments In Non-Competition Agreements|publisher=Kenneth Vanko|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also if the agreement is part of a general employment contract then there is the possibility of a prior breach by an employer. This may cause the non-compete clause of the contract to become unenforceable. However, recent case law from Florida's appellate courts has eroded the utility of the prior breach defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollard|first1=Jonathan|title=Recent Florida Non-Compete Cases: A Decision from the 3rd DCA on Independent Clauses|url=http://www.pollardllc.com/recent-florida-non-compete-cases-decision-3rd-dca-independent-clauses/|website=Jonathan Pollard LLC|publisher=Jonathan Pollard LLC|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hawaii===
A new law bars high-tech companies, but only such companies, in Hawaii from requiring their employees to enter into “non-compete” and “non-solicit” agreements as a condition of employment. The new law, Act 158, went into effect on July 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://casetext.com/posts/hawaii-bans-non-compete-and-non-solicit-clauses-in-high-tech-employment|title=Casetext|author=|date=|website=casetext.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illinois===
Noncompete agreements will be enforced in [[Illinois]] if the agreement is ancillary to a valid relationship (employment, sale of a business, etc.) and (1) must be no greater in scope than is required to protect a legitimate business interest of the employer, (2) must not impose an undue hardship on the employee, and (3) cannot be injurious to the public.&lt;ref name="Reliable Fire"&gt;Reliable Fire Equipment Co. v. Arredondo, 2011 IL 111871 [http://sherinianlaw.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Reliable-Fire1.pdf] (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; While reasonable geographic and temporal limitations on the noncompete agreement are not expressly required by governing law, they tend to be examined as a measure of whether the scope of the noncompete is greater than is required to protect a legitimate business interest of the employer.&lt;ref name="Bires"&gt;Bires v. Waltom, Case No. 8-4680 [http://sherinianlaw.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1291.pdf] (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other jurisdictions, which follow the general rule that consideration is only important as to whether it exists and not as to whether it is adequate, Illinois will inquire into the adequacy of consideration.&lt;ref name="Fifield"&gt;Fifield v. Premier Dealer Services, 993 N.E.2d 938, 942 (Ill. App. Ct. 1st Dist. 2013)[http://sherinianlaw.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1120327.pdf] (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of courts will require at least two years of continued at-will employment to support a noncompete agreement (or any other type of restrictive covenant). However, in certain cases involving particularly sharp conduct by an employee, courts have required less.

While Illinois courts state the rule above, logically the analytical steps should be in reverse order—because inadequate consideration is fatal to the claim. Thus, under ''McInnis v. OAG Motorcycle Ventures, Inc.''&lt;ref name="McInnis"&gt;McInnis v. OAG Motorcycle Ventures, Inc. [http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Opinions/AppellateCourt/2015/1stDistrict/1142644.pdf 2015 IL App (1st) 130097 (June 25, 2015)]&lt;/ref&gt; there are three requirements in order for a post employment restrictive covenant limiting a former employee’s right to work for a competitor to be enforceable under Illinois law:
(1) it must be ancillary to a valid contract;
(2) it must be supported by adequate consideration; and
(3) it must be reasonable, considering whether it: (a) is no greater than is required for the protection of a legitimate business interest of the employer, (b) does not impose undue hardship on the employee, and (c) is not injurious to the public.
The ''McInnis'' decision interpreted the ''Fifield'' decision, above, to mandate two years’ employment in order for consideration to be adequate.

Starting in 2017, Illinois banned noncompete clauses against employees earning less than $13 per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Channick |first1=Robert |title=Illinois sues payday lender over low-wage workers forced to sign noncompete agreements |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-illinois-payday-lender-noncompete-lawsuit-20171026-story.html |accessdate=11 August 2018 |agency=Chicago Tribune |date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Non-Compete Agreements - Frequently Asked Questions |url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/577e9d93b3db2b9290cd7005/t/5a5d310853450ac1205e382d/1516056841326/Illinois+outreach+materials+on+Non_Compete_Agreements.pdf |website=Office of the Attorney General |publisher=State of Illinois |accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical context====
By 1837, Massachusetts had indisputably adopted the analysis established in ''Mitchel''.&lt;ref name="Alger53"&gt;''Alger'', 36 Mass. at 53 (1837).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, the Supreme Judicial Court eliminated any doubt that restrictive covenants in the employment context would be enforced when reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''Sherman v. Pfefferkorn'', [http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/241/241mass468.html 241 Mass. 468] (1922).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Current law====
The basic proposition enunciated long ago continues to apply: “A covenant not to compete is enforceable only if it is necessary to protect a legitimate business interest, reasonably limited in time and space, and consonant with the public interest.” &lt;ref&gt;''Lunt v. Campbell'', No. 07-3845-BLS, *5 (Super. Ct Sept. 2007), ''quoting'' ''Boulanger v. Dunkin' Donuts Inc.'', [http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/442/442mass635.html 442 Mass. 635], 639 (2004), ''citing'' ''Marine Contrs. Co. v. Hurley'', [http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/365/365mass280.html 365 Mass. 280], 287-88, 289 (1974) and ''All Stainless, Inc. v. Colby'', [http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/364/364mass773.html 364 Mass. 773], 778 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Reasonableness=====
Reasonableness is the touchstone of the analysis and is highly fact-dependent.&lt;ref&gt;''Edwards v. Athena Capital Advisors'', Civil Action No. 07-2418-E (Super. Ct. Aug. 7, 2007) (“Covenants not to compete are valid if they are reasonable in view of all the facts in a particular case.”), ''citing Marine Contractors. Co. v. Hurley'', [http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/365/365mass280.html 365 Mass. 280], 287-288 (1974); ''All Stainless, Inc. v. Colby'', [http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/364/364mass773.html 364 Mass. 773], 778 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; The context in which the CNC arises (such as employment relationship, contractual relationship) is a critical factor in the analysis.&lt;ref&gt;''Sentry Ins. v. Firnstein'', [http://masscases.com/cases/app/14/14massappct706.html 14 Mass. App. Ct. 706], 707 (1982) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 188 comment g (1981)); ''Zabota Community Center, Inc. v. Frolova'', No. 061909BLS1, *2 (May 18, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; A CNC that is unreasonable because it is too broad, will be scaled back if it is in fact capable of being narrowed.&lt;ref&gt;''See Edwards v. Athena Capital Advisors, Inc.'', C.A. No. 07-2418-E, 2007 Mass. Super. LEXIS 378 (Super. Ct., Aug. 7, 2007), ''quoting All Stainless, Inc. v. Colby'', [http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/364/364mass773.html 364 Mass. 773], 778 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when a CNC is limited in duration, geographic reach, and scope, it will be enforced “only to the extent . . . necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the employer.” &lt;ref&gt;''EMC Corp. v. Gresham'', No. 01-2084-BLS (Super. Ct. Nov. 2001), ''citing Novelty Bias Binding Co. v. Shevrin'', [http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/342/342mass714.html 342 Mass. 714], 716 (1961); ''Marine Contractors Co., Inc. v. Hurley'', [http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/365/365mass280.html 365 Mass. 280], 287 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; Recognized legitimate business interests are generally identified as the protection of trade secrets, confidential information, and goodwill.&lt;ref&gt;''Marine Contractors Co., Inc. v.

=====Consideration=====
An otherwise valid CNC must still, like other contracts, be supported by consideration. Accordingly, the Supreme Judicial Court has held that a CNC must be “ancillary . . . to an existing employment or contract of employment” or some other “permissible transaction . . . .” &lt;ref&gt;''Novelty Bias Binding Co., v. Shevrin'', [http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/342/342mass714.html 342 Mass. 714], 716-17 (1961).&lt;/ref&gt; However, consideration can exist regardless of whether the CNC is entered into at the beginning of the employment relationship, during the term of employment, or even at the end of an employment relationship.&lt;ref&gt;''See Marine Contractors Co., Inc. v. Hurley'', [http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/365/365mass280.html 365 Mass. 280], 288 (1974) (“Marine's interest in protecting its accrued good will from possible incursions by Hurley is not weakened by the fact that it negotiated the agreement not to compete at the end of Hurley's employment rather than at some earlier time.”); ''Novelty Bias Binding Co., v. Shevrin'', [http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/342/342mass714.html 342 Mass. 714] (1961); ''Richmond Bros. Inc. v. Westinghouse Bdcst. Co. Inc.'', [http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/357/357mass106.html 357 Mass. 106] (1970). ''But see Zabota Community Center, Inc. v. Frolova'', No. 061909BLS1, *2 n.3 (Super. Ct. May 2006) (Although the plaintiff cited its mid-employment threat of termination as proof of consideration for the CNC, the court “exercising its equitable powers, sees it rather differently.”).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texas===
Under [[Texas]] [[Law of Texas|law]] "a covenant not to compete is enforceable if it is ancillary to or part of an otherwise enforceable agreement at the time the agreement is made to the extent that it contains limitations as to time, geographical area, and scope of activity to be restrained that are reasonable and do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interest of the promisee."&lt;ref&gt;Texas Business and Commerce Code, Section 15.50a.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific rules apply to physicians, notably that a physician cannot be prohibited "from providing continuing care and treatment to a specific patient or patients during the course of an acute illness even after the contract or employment has been terminated."&lt;ref&gt;Texas Business and Commerce Code, Section 15.50b.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Texas courts will not enforce a covenant not to compete if the court determines that such a covenant "is against public policy and therefore substantively unconscionable."&lt;ref&gt;Sec. Serv. Fed. Credit Union v. Sanders, 264 S.W.3d 292, 297 (Tex. App.–San Antonio 2008, orig. proceeding)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utah===
CNCs are enforceable, but any CNC entered into after May 10, 2016 may not extend for a period of more than one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865649717/Utah-lawmakers-pass-controversial-bill-on-noncompete-contracts.html|title=Utah lawmakers pass controversial bill on noncompete contracts|last=Romboy|first=Dennis|date=2016-03-09|work=DeseretNews.com|access-date=2017-03-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bfvlaw.com/what-utah-employers-need-to-know-about-h-b-251-post-employment-restrictions-act/|title=What Utah Employers Need to Know About H.B. 251: Post-Employment Restrictions Act {{!}} Berman Fink Van Horn P.C.|date=2016-03-30|work=Berman Fink Van Horn P.C.|access-date=2017-03-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virginia===
In [[Virginia]], the enforceability of covenants not to compete is governed by [[common law]] principles. As restrictions on trade, CNCs are not favored by Virginia courts, which will enforce only narrowly drafted CNCs that do not offend public policy.

In Virginia, a [[plaintiff]] must prove by a [[preponderance of the evidence]] that the covenant is reasonable in the sense that it is: (1) no greater than necessary to protect its legitimate business interests, such as a [[trade secret]]; (2) not unduly harsh or oppressive in restricting the employee's ability to earn a living; and (3) not against public policy. ''Paramount Termite Control Co., Inc v. Rector'', 380 S.E.2d 922, 924 (Va. 1989).

==== Legitimate business interest ====
In Virginia, courts weigh the (1) function, (2) geographic scope and (3) duration of the CNC against the employer's legitimate business interests to determine their reasonableness.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''[[Advanced Marine Enters., Inc. v. PRC Inc.]]'', 501 S.E.2d 148, 155 (Va. 1998); ''[[Simmons v. Miller]]'', 544 S.E.2d 666, 678 (Va. 2001) (stating that the function, geographic scope and duration of the CNC must be considered together to determine the reasonableness of the restriction).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, CNCs are only reasonable if they prevent the employee from entering into direct competition with the employer and must not encompass any activity in which the employer is not engaged.&lt;ref&gt;''See e.g.'' ''[[Omniplex World Servs. Corp. v. US Investigations Servs., Inc.]]'', 618 S.E.2d 340, 342 (Va. 2005) (“covenants not to compete have only been upheld when employees are prohibited from competing directly with the former employer or through employment with a direct competitor.”); ''see also'' ''[[Motion Control Sys. v. East]]'', 546 S.E.2d 424 (Va. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia courts will not generally attempt to revise or enforce a narrower restriction in a non-compete agreement. As a result, a drafting error or unenforceable restriction may render the entire agreement unenforceable in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vaemploymentlawyers.com/2015/06/non-competition-law-trends-in-virginia.html Non-Competition Law Trends in Virginia], Virginia Employment Lawyers Blog, June 5, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reasonable restriction on employee's ability to earn a living====
Second, to enforce the CNC, a plaintiff must show that it is not unduly harsh or oppressive in restricting the employee's ability to earn a living. In Virginia, a CNC is not unduly harsh or oppressive if balancing its function, geographic scope and duration the employee is not precluded from (1) working in a capacity not in competition with the employer within the restricted area or (2) providing similar services outside the restricted area.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''Paramount'', 380 S.E.2d at 925.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public policy====
Third, to enforce a CNC, a plaintiff must show the CNC is reasonable from the standpoint of a sound public policy. Virginia does not favor restrictions on employment and therefore CNCs are generally held against public policy unless they are narrowly drafted as enumerated above. In Virginia, a CNC does not violate public policy if the restrictions it imposes do not create a monopoly for the services offered by the employer or create a shortage of the skills provided by the employee.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''Blue Ridge Anesthesia &amp; Critical Care, Inc. v. Gidick'', 389 S.E.2d 467, 470 (Va. 1990); ''Paramount'', 380 S.E.2d at 925.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Washington===
According to ''Racine v. Bender'', CNCs will be enforced by courts if they are validly formed and reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;''Racine v. Bender'', 141 Wash. 606, 615, 252 P. 115 (1927)&lt;/ref&gt; There are exceptions, like in ''[[Labriola v. Pollard Group, Inc.]]'', where the [[Washington Supreme Court]] invalidated a CNC not supported by independent consideration by strictly enforcing the [[pre-existing duty rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, I., and Speidel, R.E. Studies in Contract Law, Seventh Edition. Foundation Press, New York, NY: 2008, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
[[Canada|Canadian]] courts will enforce non-competition and [[Non-solicitation|non-solicitation agreements]], however, the agreement must be limited in time frame, business scope, and geographic scope to what is reasonably required to protect the company's proprietary rights, such as confidential marketing information or client relations&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cba.org/abc/nouvelles/pdf/ADD-enforceability.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the scope of the agreement must be unambiguously defined. The 2009 [[Supreme Court of Canada]] case ''Shafron v. KRG Insurance Brokers (Western) Inc. 2009 SCC 6,'' held a non-compete agreement to be invalid due to the term "Metropolitan City of Vancouver" not being legally defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The 2000 [[Ontario Court of Appeals]] case ''Lyons v. Multary'' established a general preference towards non-solicitation over non-competition agreements, regarding the latter as "much more drastic weapons" and held a non-competition agreement to be invalid when a non-solicitation agreement would have been sufficient to protect the company's interests.

==Europe==
Generally, CNCs are allowable in [[Europe]] only if the employer can show a reasonable business interest in having a CNC.
* In '''[[Belgium]]''', CNCs are restricted to new employments within Belgium and for no more than one year. The employer must pay financial compensation for the duration of the CNC, amounting at least half of the gross salary for the corresponding period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.droitbelge.be/fiches_detail.asp?idcat=25&amp;id=208 Clause de non-concurrence – conditions de validité]. DroitBelge.net.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''[[France]]''', CNCs must be limited in time to a maximum of two years and to a region where there the employee’s new work can reasonably be seen as competitive. The region can be a city or the whole country, depending on the circumstances. The employer must pay financial compensation, typically 30 percent of the last salary&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F1910 Qu'est-ce qu'une clause de non-concurrence ?]. Service-Public.fr&lt;/ref&gt;. A CNC may not unreasonably limit the possibilities of the employee to find a new employment.
* In '''[[Germany]]''', CNCs are allowed for a term up to two years. The employer must provide financial compensation for the duration of the CNC amounting to at least half the gross salary.&lt;ref&gt;German law, [http://dejure.org/gesetze/HGB/74.html §74 HBS, abs. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Unreasonable clauses – for example, excluding similar jobs throughout the whole of Germany – can be invalidated.
* In '''[[Italy]]''', CNCs are regulated by articles 2125, 2596, and 1751 bis of the civil code.
* In the '''[[Netherlands]]''', non-compete clauses (''non-concurrentiebeding'' or ''concurrentiebeding'') are allowed regarding issues such as moving to a new employer and approaching customers of the old company. Unreasonable clauses can be invalidated in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intermediair.nl/artikel.jsp?id=69683|title=Gebonden aan concurrentiebeding?|publisher=Intermediair|date=2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614192424/http://intermediair.nl/artikel.jsp?id=69683|archive-date=2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''[[Portugal]]''', CNCs are regulated by article 136 of the labor code and restricted to two years extendible to three years in cases of access to particularly sensitive information. The employer must pay financial compensation for the duration of the CNC but the law doesn’t specify anything regarding the amount of the compensation.&lt;ref&gt;Portuguese labour code, [http://www.cite.gov.pt/pt/legis/CodTrab_L1_004.html#L004S9 Article 136]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''[[Romania]]''', CNCs are regulated by articles 21-24 of the labor code and restricted to two years. The employer must pay financial compensation for the duration of the CNC, amounting to at least 50 percent of the last 6 months salary.
* In '''[[Spain]]''', CNCs are regulated by article 21 of the labor law. CNCs are allowed up to two years for technical professions and six months for other professions.
* In the '''[[United Kingdom]]''', CNCs are called [[restraint of trade]] clauses, and may be used only if the employer can prove a legitimate business interest to protect in entering the clause into the contract. Mere competition will not amount to a legitimate business interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303191054/http://www.lawdit.co.uk/reading_room/room/view_article.asp?name=../articles/Restraint+of+Trade.htm|title=Restraint of trade clauses - Commercial Law Articles and News - Lawdit Reading Room|author=|date=3 March 2012|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
Section 27 of the [[Indian Contract Act, 1872|Indian Contract Act]] has a general bar on any agreement that puts a restriction on trade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indiancontractact/indiancontractact.html#27_Agreement_in_restraint_of_trade_void&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, it would appear that all non-compete clauses in India are invalid. However, the Supreme Court of India has clarified that some non-compete clauses may be in interest of trade and commerce, and such clauses are not barred by Section 27 of the Contract Act, and therefore valid in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Non-compete clauses in Employment Agreements: Are they enforceable in India? | url = http://blog.ipleaders.in/non-compete-clauses-in-employment-agreements-are-they-enforceable-in-india | publisher = iPleaders.in | date = 29 May 2014 | accessdate = 31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, only those clauses backed by a clear objective that is considered to be in advantage of trade and commerce survives this test. For instance, a co-founder of a startup who signed a non-compete clause can be held to it,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = CO-FOUNDER’S AGREEMENT: Things you should look out for while entering into a co-founders agreement | url = http://blog.ipleaders.in/co-founders-agreement-things-you-should-look-out-for-while-entering-into-a-co-founders-agreement/ | publisher = iPleaders.in | date = 9 June 2014 | accessdate = 31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but if a junior software developer or a call center employee signs a non-compete clause with the employer, the same may not be enforceable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Is a non compete contract valid in India? If yes, to what level? | url = http://www.quora.com/Is-a-non-compete-contract-valid-in-India-If-yes-to-what-level? | publisher = quora.com | date = 18 August 2012 | accessdate = 31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pakistan==
According to Section 27 of the Contract Act, 1872, any agreement that restrains a person from exercising a lawful profession, trade or business is void.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Labor and Employment Practice Group Non-Competition | url = http://www.lexmundi.com/Document.asp?DocID=1508 | publisher = LexMundi Puplications Ltd. | date = 2010 | accessdate = 24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, courts of Pakistan have made decisions in the past in favour of such restrictive clauses given that the restrictions are "reasonable".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Can I be stopped from undertaking competitive work after resignation from a company? | url = https://lawyereadia.wordpress.com/tag/non-compete-clause/ | date = 13 March 2014 | accessdate = 24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of "reasonable" depends on the time-period, geographical location and the designation of employee. In the case of ''Exide Pakistan Limited vs. Abdul Wadood, 2008 CLD 1258 (Karachi)'', the High Court of Sindh stated that reasonableness of the clause will vary from case to case and depends mainly on duration and extent of geographical territory &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Counsel Pakistan - Corporate Decisions | url = http://www.counselpakistan.com/vol-1/legal-updates/corporate-decision.php}} See Exide Pakistan Ltd. vs. Malik Abdul Wadood 2009 CLD 716 (Division Bench – Karachi)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related restrictive covenants==
While CNCs are one of the most common types of restrictive covenants, there are many others. Each serves a specific purpose and provides specific rights and remedies. The most common types of restrictive covenants are as follows:
* [[Garden leave|Garden-leave clause]]: a type of CNC by which an employee is compensated during the period that the employee is restricted.
* Forfeiture-for-Competition Agreement and Compensation-for-Competition Agreement: an agreement by which an employee either forfeits certain benefits or pays some amount of money to engage in activities that are competitive with his former employer.
* Forfeiture agreement: an agreement by which an employee forfeits benefits when his employment terminates, regardless of whether he engages in competitive activities.
* [[Non-disclosure agreement|Nondisclosure/confidentiality agreement]]: an agreement by which a party agrees not to use or disclose the other party's confidential information.
* [[Non-solicitation|Non-solicitation agreement]]: an agreement by which an employee agrees not to solicit and/or not to accept business from the employer's customers.
* Antipiracy agreement: an agreement by which an employee agrees not to solicit and/or not to hire the employer's employees.
* Invention assignment agreement: an agreement by which an employee assigns to the employer any potential inventions conceived of during employment.

The enforceability of these agreements depends on the law of the particular state. As a general rule, however, with the exception of invention assignment agreements, they are subject to the same analysis as other CNCs.&lt;ref&gt;For more detailed information, see [http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9133835/Beyond_the_noncompete?taxonomyId=10&amp;pageNumber=1 Beyond the noncompete]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases==
* In 2005, [[Microsoft]] and [[Google]] litigated the enforceability of a non-compete clause in [[Kai-Fu Lee|Kai-Fu Lee's]] employment contract with Microsoft. Difference in state laws were highlighted as Google attempted to maneuver the case to California courts, where California law would be more likely to hold the clause unenforceable.&lt;ref name=kaifulee&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Calif.

The case was eventually settled outside of court. |work=[[CNET]] |date=November 8, 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[IBM v.

On October 22, IBM filed suit. |work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |date=November 8, 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operations research''', or '''operational research''' in British usage,  is a discipline that deals with the application of advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informs.org/About-INFORMS/About-Operations-Research |title=About Operations Research |publisher=INFORMS.org |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the term 'operational analysis' is used in the British (and some British Commonwealth) military as an intrinsic part of capability development, management and assurance.  In particular, operational analysis forms part of the Combined Operational Effectiveness and Investment Appraisals (COEIA), which support British defense capability acquisition decision-making.

It is often considered to be a sub-field of [[applied mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathontheweb.org/mathweb/mi-mathbyclass.html |title=Mathematics Subject Classification |publisher=American Mathematical Society |date= 23 May 2011 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The terms [[management science]] and [[decision science]] are sometimes used as synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Systems analysis for computer-based information systems|series=West series in data processing and information systems|first=James C.|last=Wetherbe|publisher=West Pub. Co.|year=1979|isbn=9780829902280|quotation=A systems analyst who contributes in the area of DSS must be skilled in such areas as management science (synonymous with decision science and operation research), modeling, simulation, and advanced statistics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employing techniques from other mathematical sciences, such as [[mathematical model]]ing, [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and [[mathematical optimization]], operations research arrives at optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex decision-making problems. Because of its emphasis on human-technology interaction and because of its focus on practical applications, operations research has overlap with other disciplines, notably [[industrial engineering]] and [[operations management]], and draws on [[psychology]] and [[Organizational studies|organization science]]. Operations research is often concerned with determining the [[Maxima and minima|maximum]] (of profit, performance, or yield) or minimum (of loss, risk, or cost) of some real-world objective. Originating in military efforts before World War II, its techniques have grown to concern problems in a variety of industries.&lt;ref name="hsor.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsor.org/what_is_or.cfm |title=What is OR |publisher=HSOR.org |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--[[File:Operation research study 01.svg|thumb|480px|Model of Operation research study, based on Stafford Beer (1959).&lt;ref&gt;Stafford Beer (1959). ''Cybernetic and Management''. English Universities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;

==Overview==
Operational research (OR) encompasses a wide range of problem-solving techniques and methods applied in the pursuit of improved decision-making and efficiency, such as [[simulation]], [[mathematical optimization]], [[queueing theory]] and other [[Stochastic process|stochastic-process]] models, [[Markov Decision Process|Markov decision processes]], [[Econometrics|econometric methods]], [[data envelopment analysis]], [[neural networks]], [[Expert System|expert systems]], [[decision analysis]], and the [[analytic hierarchy process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos044.htm |title=Operations Research Analysts |publisher=Bls.gov |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all of these techniques involve the construction of mathematical models that attempt to describe the system. Because of the computational and statistical nature of most of these fields, OR also has strong ties to [[computer science]] and [[analytics]]. Operational researchers faced with a new problem must determine which of these techniques are most appropriate given the nature of the system, the goals for improvement, and constraints on time and computing power.

The major sub-disciplines in modern operational research, as identified by the journal ''Operations Research'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.informs.org/site/OperationsResearch/index.php?c=10&amp;kat=Forthcoming+Papers |title=OR / Pubs / IOL Home |publisher=INFORMS.org |date=2 January 2009 |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527093022/http://www.informs.org/site/OperationsResearch/index.php?c=10&amp;kat=Forthcoming+Papers |archivedate=27 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are:
* Computing and information technologies
* [[Financial engineering]]
* [[Manufacturing]], [[service science]]s, and [[supply chain management]]
* Policy modeling and public sector work
* Revenue management
* [[Simulation]]
* [[Stochastics|Stochastic models]]
* Transportation

==History==
In the decades after the two world wars, the tools of operations research were more widely applied to problems in business, industry and society. Since that time, operational research has expanded into a field widely used in industries ranging from petrochemicals to airlines, finance, logistics, and government, moving to a focus on the development of mathematical models that can be used to analyse and optimize complex systems, and has become an area of active academic and industrial research.&lt;ref name="hsor.org"/&gt;

===Historical origins===
In the 17th century, mathematicians like [[Christiaan Huygens]] and [[Blaise Pascal]] ([[problem of points]]) tried to solve problems involving complex decisions with [[probability]]. Others in the 18th and 19th centuries solved these types of problems with [[combinatorics]]. [[Charles Babbage]]'s research into the cost of transportation and sorting of mail led to England's [[Uniform Penny Post|universal "Penny Post"]] in 1840, and studies into the dynamical behaviour of railway vehicles in defence of the [[Great Western Railway|GWR]]'s broad gauge.&lt;ref&gt;M.S. Sodhi, "What about the 'O' in O.R.?" OR/MS Today, December, 2007, p. 12, http://www.lionhrtpub.com/orms/orms-12-07/frqed.html&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 20th century, study of inventory management could be considered the origin of modern operations research with [[Economic order quantity|economic order quantity]] developed by [[Ford W. Harris]] in 1913. Operational research may have originated in the efforts of military planners during World War I (convoy theory and [[Lanchester's laws]]). [[Percy Bridgman]] brought operational research to bear on problems in physics in the 1920s and would later attempt to extend these to the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;P. W. Bridgman, The Logic of Modern Physics, The MacMillan Company, New York, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; 

Modern operational research originated at the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment|Bawdsey Research Station]] in the UK in 1937 and was the result of an initiative of the station's superintendent, [[Albert Percival Rowe|A. P. Rowe]]. Rowe conceived the idea as a means to analyse and improve the working of the UK's [[early warning radar]] system, [[Chain Home]] (CH). Initially, he analysed the operating of the radar equipment and its communication networks, expanding later to include the operating personnel's behaviour. This revealed unappreciated limitations of the CH network and allowed remedial action to be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/682073/operations-research/68171/History#ref22348 |title=operations research (industrial engineering) :: History – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists in the United Kingdom including [[Patrick Maynard Stuart Blackett|Patrick Blackett]] (later Lord Blackett OM PRS), [[Cecil Gordon (scientist)|Cecil Gordon]], [[Solly Zuckerman, Baron Zuckerman|Solly Zuckerman]], (later Baron Zuckerman OM, KCB, FRS), [[Conrad Hal Waddington|C. H. Waddington]], [[Owen Wansbrough-Jones]], [[Frank Yates]], [[Jacob Bronowski]] and [[Freeman Dyson]], and in the United States with [[George Dantzig]] looked for ways to make better decisions in such areas as [[logistics]] and training schedules

===Second World War===

The modern field of operational research arose during World War II. In the World War II era, operational research was defined as "a scientific method of providing executive departments with a quantitative basis for decisions regarding the operations under their control".&lt;ref name=C67-3-4-48-para-1&gt;"Operational Research in the British Army 1939–1945, October 1947, Report C67/3/4/48, UK National Archives file WO291/1301&lt;br /&gt;Quoted on the dust-jacket of: Morse, Philip M, and Kimball, George E, ''Methods of Operation Research'', 1st edition revised, MIT Press &amp; J Wiley, 5th printing, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; Other names for it included operational analysis (UK Ministry of Defence from 1962)&lt;ref name=PROCATWO291&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATID=109&amp;CATLN=2&amp;Highlight=&amp;FullDetails=True UK National Archives Catalogue for WO291] lists a War Office organisation called [[Army Operational Research Group]] (AORG) that existed from 1946 to 1962. "In January 1962 the name was changed to Army Operational Research Establishment (AORE). Following the creation of a unified Ministry of Defence, a tri-service operational research organisation was established: the [[Defence Operational Research Establishment]] (DOAE) which was formed in 1965, and it the Army Operational Research Establishment based at West Byfleet."&lt;/ref&gt; and quantitative management.&lt;ref&gt;http://brochure.unisa.ac.za/myunisa/data/subjects/Quantitative%20Management.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War II|Second World War]] close to 1,000 men and women in Britain were engaged in operational research. About 200 operational research scientists worked for the [[British Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA117 p. 117] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827004623/https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA117 |date=27 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patrick Blackett]] worked for several different organizations during the war. Early in the war while working for the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) he set up a team known as the "Circus" which helped to reduce the number of [[anti-aircraft artillery]] rounds needed to shoot down an enemy aircraft from an average of over 20,000 at the start of the [[Battle of Britain]] to 4,000 in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA94 pp. 91–94] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827041022/https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA94 |date=27 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:B 24 in raf service 23 03 05.jpg|thumb|A [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Liberator]] in standard RAF green/dark earth/black night bomber finish as originally used by Coastal Command]]
In 1941, Blackett moved from the RAE to the Navy, after first working with [[RAF Coastal Command]], in 1941 and then early in 1942 to the [[Admiralty]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA109 p. 96,109] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002032938/https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA109 |date=2 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackett's team at Coastal Command's Operational Research Section (CC-ORS) included two future [[Nobel prize]] winners and many other people who went on to be pre-eminent in their fields.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA96 p. 96] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327234509/https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA96 |date=27 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They undertook a number of crucial analyses that aided the war effort. Britain introduced the [[convoy]] system to reduce shipping losses, but while the principle of using warships to accompany merchant ships was generally accepted, it was unclear whether it was better for convoys to be small or large. Convoys travel at the speed of the slowest member, so small convoys can travel faster. It was also argued that small convoys would be harder for German [[U-boat]]s to detect. On the other hand, large convoys could deploy more warships against an attacker. Blackett's staff showed that the losses suffered by convoys depended largely on the number of escort vessels present, rather than the size of the convoy. Their conclusion was that a few large convoys are more defensible than many small ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familyheritage.ca/Articles/victory1943.html |title="Numbers are Essential": Victory in the North Atlantic Reconsidered, March–May 1943 |publisher=Familyheritage.ca |date=24 May 1943 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While performing an analysis of the methods used by [[RAF Coastal Command]] to hunt and destroy submarines, one of the analysts asked what colour the aircraft were. As most of them were from Bomber Command they were painted black for night-time operations. At the suggestion of CC-ORS a test was run to see if that was the best colour to camouflage the aircraft for daytime operations in the grey North Atlantic skies. Tests showed that aircraft painted white were on average not spotted until they were 20% closer than those painted black. This change indicated that 30% more submarines would be attacked and sunk for the same number of sightings.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA101 p. 101]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these findings Coastal Command changed their aircraft to using white undersurfaces.

Other work by the CC-ORS indicated that on average if the trigger depth of aerial-delivered [[depth charge]]s (DCs) were changed from 100 feet to 25 feet, the kill ratios would go up. The reason was that if a U-boat saw an aircraft only shortly before it arrived over the target then at 100 feet the charges would do no damage (because the U-boat wouldn't have had time to descend as far as 100 feet), and if it saw the aircraft a long way from the target it had time to alter course under water so the chances of it being within the 20-foot kill zone of the charges was small. It was more efficient to attack those submarines close to the surface when the targets' locations were better known than to attempt their destruction at greater depths when their positions could only be guessed. Before the change of settings from 100 feet to 25 feet, 1% of submerged U-boats were sunk and 14% damaged. After the change, 7% were sunk and 11% damaged. (If submarines were caught on the surface, even if attacked shortly after submerging, the numbers rose to 11% sunk and 15% damaged). Blackett observed "there can be few cases where such a great operational gain had been obtained by such a small and simple change of tactics".&lt;ref&gt;(Kirby, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA103 pp. 102,103])&lt;/ref&gt;

Bomber Command's Operational Research Section (BC-ORS), analyzed a report of a survey carried out by [[RAF Bomber Command]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} For the survey, Bomber Command inspected all bombers returning from bombing raids over Germany over a particular period. All damage inflicted by German [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defences]] was noted and the recommendation was given that armour be added in the most heavily damaged areas. This recommendation was not adopted because the fact that the aircraft returned with these areas damaged indicated these areas were not vital, and adding armour to non-vital areas where damage is acceptable negatively affects aircraft performance. Their suggestion to remove some of the crew so that an aircraft loss would result in fewer personnel losses, was also rejected by RAF command. Blackett's team made the logical recommendation that the armour be placed in the areas which were completely untouched by damage in the bombers which returned. They reasoned that the survey was biased, since it only included aircraft that returned to Britain. The untouched areas of returning aircraft were probably vital areas, which, if hit, would result in the loss of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Dirty Little Secrets of the Twentieth Century | publisher=[[Harper Paperbacks]] | author=James F. Dunnigan | year=1999 | pages=215–217}}&lt;/ref&gt; This story has been disputed,&lt;ref&gt;http://lesswrong.com/lw/bbv/examine_your_assumptions/&lt;/ref&gt; with a similar damage assessment study completed in the US by the Statistical Research Group at Columbia University&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1080/01621459.1980.10477469|title = The Statistical Research Group, 1942–1945|journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume = 75|issue = 370|pages = 320–330|year = 1980|last1 = Wallis|first1 = W. Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the result of work done by [[Abraham Wald]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2288257|title = Abraham Wald's Work on Aircraft Survivability|journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume = 79|issue = 386|pages = 259|last1 = Mangel|first1 = Marc|last2 = Samaniego|first2 = Francisco J|doi = 10.2307/2288257|year = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

When Germany organized its air defences into the [[Kammhuber Line]], it was realized by the British that if the RAF bombers were to fly in a [[bomber stream]] they could overwhelm the night fighters who flew in individual cells directed to their targets by ground controllers. It was then a matter of calculating the statistical loss from collisions against the statistical loss from night fighters to calculate how close the bombers should fly to minimize RAF losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/thousands.html |title=RAF History – Bomber Command 60th Anniversary |publisher=Raf.mod.uk |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "exchange rate" ratio of output to input was a characteristic feature of operational research. By comparing the number of flying hours put in by Allied aircraft to the number of U-boat sightings in a given area, it was possible to redistribute aircraft to more productive patrol areas. Comparison of exchange rates established "effectiveness ratios" useful in planning. The ratio of 60 [[Mine (naval)|mines]] laid per ship sunk was common to several campaigns: German mines in British ports, British mines on German routes, and United States mines in Japanese routes.&lt;ref name="Proceedings"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Milkman, Raymond H. |title=Operation Research in World War II |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] Proceedings |date=May 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operational research doubled the on-target bomb rate of [[B-29]]s bombing Japan from the [[Marianas Islands]] by increasing the training ratio from 4 to 10 percent of flying hours; revealed that wolf-packs of three United States submarines were the most effective number to enable all members of the pack to engage targets discovered on their individual patrol stations; revealed that glossy enamel paint was more effective camouflage for night fighters than traditional dull camouflage paint finish, and the smooth paint finish increased airspeed by reducing skin friction.&lt;ref name="Proceedings"/&gt;

On land, the operational research sections of the Army Operational Research Group (AORG) of the [[Ministry of Supply]] (MoS) were landed in [[Operation Overlord|Normandy in 1944]], and they followed British forces in the advance across Europe. They analyzed, among other topics, the effectiveness of artillery, aerial bombing and anti-tank shooting.

===After World War II===
{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}
With expanded techniques and growing awareness of the field at the close of the war, operational research was no longer limited to only operational, but was extended to encompass equipment procurement, training, logistics and infrastructure. Operations Research also grew in many areas other than the military once scientists learned to apply its principles to the civilian sector. With the development of the [[simplex algorithm]] for [[linear programming]] in 1947&lt;ref name="pitt.edu"&gt;{{cite book|title=PRINCIPLES AND APPLICATIONS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH |contribution=1.2 A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~jrclass/or/or-intro.html#history}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the development of computers over the next three decades, Operations Research can now "solve problems with hundreds of thousands of variables and constraints. Moreover, the large volumes of data required for such problems can be stored and manipulated very efficiently."&lt;ref name="pitt.edu"/&gt;

==Problems addressed==

Operational research is also used extensively in government where [[evidence-based policy]] is used.

==Management science==
{{main|Management science}}
In 1967 [[Stafford Beer]] characterized the field of management science as "the business use of operations research".&lt;ref&gt;[[Stafford Beer]] (1967) ''Management Science: The Business Use of Operations Research''&lt;/ref&gt; However, in modern times the term management science may also be used to refer to the separate fields of [[organizational studies]] or [[corporate strategy]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Like operational research itself, management science (MS) is an interdisciplinary branch of applied mathematics devoted to optimal decision planning, with strong links with economics, business, engineering, and other [[science]]s. It uses various [[science|scientific]] [[research]]-based principles, [[Strategy|strategies]], and [[analytical method]]s including [[mathematical model]]ing, statistics and [[numerical algorithm]]s to improve an organization's ability to enact rational and meaningful management decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems. Management scientists help businesses to achieve their goals using the scientific methods of operational research.

The management scientist's mandate is to use rational, systematic, science-based techniques to inform and improve decisions of all kinds. Of course, the techniques of management science are not restricted to business applications but may be applied to military, medical, public administration, charitable groups, political groups or community groups.

Management science is concerned with developing and applying [[scientific modeling|models]] and [[concept]]s that may prove useful in helping to illuminate management issues and solve managerial problems, as well as designing and developing new and better models of organizational excellence.&lt;ref name="LS"&gt;[http://www.lums.lancs.ac.uk/departments/ManSci/DeptProfile/WhatisManSci/ What is Management Science?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914101120/http://www.lums.lancs.ac.uk/departments/ManSci/DeptProfile/WhatisManSci/ |date=14 September 2008 }} Lancaster University, 2008. Retrieved 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of these models within the corporate sector became known as management science.&lt;ref name="UTK"&gt;[http://bus.utk.edu/soms/information/whatis_msci.html What is Management Science?] The University of Tennessee, 2006. Retrieved 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications===
Applications are abundant such as in airlines, manufacturing companies, [[service organization]]s, military branches, and government. The range of problems and issues to which it has contributed insights and solutions is vast. It includes:&lt;ref name="LS"/&gt;
* Scheduling (of airlines, trains, buses etc.)
* Assignment (assigning crew to flights, trains or buses; employees to projects; commitment and dispatch of power generation facilities)
* Facility location (deciding most appropriate location for new facilities such as warehouse; factory or fire station)
* Hydraulics &amp; Piping Engineering (managing flow of water from reservoirs)
* Health Services (information and supply chain management)
* Game Theory (identifying, understanding; developing strategies adopted by companies)
* Urban Design
* Computer Network Engineering (packet routing; timing; analysis)
* Telecom &amp; Data Communication Engineering (packet routing; timing; analysis)

Management is also concerned with so-called 'soft-operational analysis' which concerns methods for [[strategic planning]], strategic [[decision support]], [[problem structuring methods]]. 
In dealing with these sorts of challenges, mathematical [[modeling and simulation]] may not be appropriate or may not suffice. Therefore, during the past 30 years{{vague|date=November 2017}}, a number of non-quantified modeling methods have been developed. These include:{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}
* stakeholder based approaches including [[metagame analysis]] and [[drama theory]]
* [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]] and various forms of [[influence diagram]]s
* cognitive mapping
* strategic choice 
* robustness analysis

He returned to Sweden in 1984 and studied economics at IHM Business School, after which he started the skateboard company Street Style with his brother Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skateboardmuseum.se/streetstyle.html|title=Skateboard Museum Sweden|publisher=Skateboardmuseum.se|accessdate=20 June 2015|language=Swedish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212826/http://www.skateboardmuseum.se/streetstyle.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he founded another skateboard company, Svea, which launched a skateboard brand and a clothing label.&lt;ref name="expressen.se"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/noje/nu-ger-per-holknekt-bort-sin-formogenhet/|title=Nu ger Per Holknekt bort sin förmögenhet|work=Expressen|accessdate=20 June 2015 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/fran-uteliggare-till-innedesigner/|title=Från uteliggare till innedesigner|work=Dagens Nyheter|accessdate=20 June 2015 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holknekt developed a [[drug addiction]], and went through a life crisis in 2000, during which he lost everything, became homeless, and supported himself by selling the Stockholm [[street newspaper]] ''[[Situation Sthlm]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helahalsingland.se/halsingland/soderhamn/om-man-ger-far-man-tillbaka|title=Om man ger får man tillbaka|work=helahalsingland.se|accessdate=20 June 2015 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sought treatment for his addiction and regained sobriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/noje/per-holknekt-lamnade-en-miljon-kr-i-skogen/|title=Per Holknekt lämnade en miljon kr i skogen|work=Expressen|accessdate=20 June 2015 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; After four months of being sober he successfully applied to become a housemate on the first season of the [[Big Brother Sverige|Swedish ''Big Brother'']] series, in which he finished in second place after being voted off in the final on Day 74.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/fran-uteliggare-till-innedesigner?a=|title=Från uteliggare till innedesigner|work=Dagens Nyheter|accessdate=20 June 2015 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was broadcast on [[Kanal 5 (Sweden)|Kanal 5]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwc.aftonbladet.se/noje/0009/03/big.html|title=Nu börjar "Big Brother"  |work=[[Aftonbladet]]|accessdate=20 June 2015 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phonogram Incorporated''' was started in 1970 as a successor to '''Philips Phonographic Industries''', a unit of the Grammophon-Philips Group (GPG), a joint venture of [[Philips]] N.V. of the Netherlands and [[Siemens]] A.G. of Germany. 

Phonogram was the name of a [[parent company]] that owned and or distributed many different [[record labels]]. Phonogram was never a record label as such, but a [[holding company]] for labels which included [[Philips Records|Phillips]], [[Fontana Records|Fontana]], [[Vertigo Records|Vertigo]] and [[Mercury Records|Mercury]].

==History==

In 1972 Grammophon-Philips Group was reorganized as The [[PolyGram]] Group. Following PolyGram's acquisition of [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] in the [[United States]], the corporate name was changed from Mercury Record Productions, Inc., to Phonogram, Inc. In the U.S. Phonogram artists were generally released on [[Mercury Records]], but the label is independent from its U.K. counterpart. By 1982, Mercury and all other PolyGram owned labels including, RSO, Polydor, Total Experience and Casablanca carried the following wording "Manufactured And Marketed by PolyGram Records" with the PolyGram Records logo.

In the [[United Kingdom]], Phonogram was the holding company for [[Philips Records]], which had started in 1953 and had also launched the Fontana label in 1958. As well as producing their own recordings many of which became U.K. hits, Philips/Fontana licensed the rights from [[Columbia Records]] (U.S.) to release and distribute their product from 1953 until the end of 1964. After that time, Columbia U.S. set up their own marketing and production unit in Theobalds Road, London, having acquired [[Oriole Records (UK)|Oriole Records]] and its record-pressing plant that had prospered in manufacturing discs for U.K. budget labels including [[Embassy Records|Embassy]], sold through [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]]. U.S. Columbia was unable to use the "Columbia" trademark outside the United States and [[Canada]] as it had already been copyrighted overseas by [[EMI]]. Therefore U.S. Columbia product was released in most territories on the [[CBS Records International|CBS]] record label. 

Releases in [[Europe]] were issued by Vertigo and Philips and carried the "Marketed by Phonogram" wording with the Phonogram logo. Phonogram also licensed recordings from small U.S. record labels for European release. Among these were [[Avco Records|Avco]], [[Sire Records|Sire]], [[Janus Records|Janus]], [[Westbound Records|Westbound]], [[All Platinum Records|All Platinum]], and [[Chess Records|Chess]].

==De-establishment==

In 1997 all PolyGram units still using the Phonogram name were renamed Mercury Records.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0tz5YpijuksC&amp;pg=PA634&amp;lpg=PA634&amp;dq=phonogram+%2B+mercury+%2B+renamed&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KX4524-NFS&amp;sig=J8yiTnQodWkkYIFlu7CZNptCnpw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GSocS_r3PNKonQehg7DiAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=phonogram%20%2B%20mercury%20%2B%20renamed&amp;f=false Books.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, Mercury had become PolyGram's flagship label. PolyGram continued until 1998, when the company was purchased by [[Seagram]] and merged with [[Universal Music Group]], now owned by [[Vivendi]].

'''Policy monitoring''' comprises a range of activities describing and analyzing the development and implementation of policies, identifying potential gaps in the process, outlining areas for improvement, and holding policy implementers accountable for their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardee|first=Karen|author2=Laili Irani |author3=Ron MacInnis |author4=Matthew Hamilton |title=Linking Health Policy With Health Systems And Health Outcomes|journal=Washington DC: Futures Group, Health Policy Project|year=2012|url=http://www.healthpolicyproject.com/pubs/186_HealthPolicySystemOutcomesConceptualALDec.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Monitoring policy development and implementation is an integral component of the [[policy cycle]] and can be applied in sectors including agriculture, health, education, and finance. Policy monitoring can improve policy information, collaboration among stakeholders, and the use of evaluation techniques to provide feedback to reframe and revise policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Cecilia|author2=Craig Watkins|title=Conceptualizing Spatial Planning Outcomes: Towards an Integrative Measurement Framework|journal=The Town Planning Review|year=2009|volume=80|issue=4/5|url=https://www.questia.com/library/1P3-1899476771/conceptualising-spatial-planning-outcomes-towards}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Waterman and Wood derived policy monitoring from [[agency theory]], describing a process where policymakers monitor the actions of their bureaucratic agents who implement and enforce policies. This monitoring allows policymakers to compensate for their agents’ greater knowledge of the policy process, and enables them to be well-informed decision makers. Thus policy monitoring allows policymakers and interested actors to systematically examine the process of creating a policy, implementing it, and evaluating its effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waterman|first=Richard|author2=Dan Wood|title=Policy Monitoring and Policy Analysis|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|year=1993|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2307/3325346/abstract|doi=10.2307/3325346|volume=12|pages=685}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Policy monitoring activities can be used to collect and analyze data related to the development and implementation of specific policies. It can also help link policies to specific outcomes and  help identify and evaluate policy impacts. Policy impacts can include specific changes in behavior (e.g., increased number of people wearing seatbelts), finances (e.g., increased tax revenue), health status or epidemiology (e.g., reduced number of new HIV infections) or other social indicators (e.g., reduced crime rates, reduced levels of pollution). Data from policy monitoring can be used to support advocacy efforts and guide the development of new, timely, and relevant policies. Policy monitoring should also include the identification of operational policy barriers that can be addressed through policy and program reform, and findings can support improved implementation of existing policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardee|first=Karen|author2=Laili Irani |author3=Ron MacInnis |author4=Matthew Hamilton |title=Linking Health Policy With Health Systems And Health Outcomes|journal=Washington DC: Futures Group, Health Policy Project|year=2012|url=http://www.healthpolicyproject.com/pubs/186_HealthPolicySystemOutcomesConceptualALDec.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Challenges ==
Numerous actors and stakeholders can influence the movement of policy from inception to implementation. Well-maintained documentation and review of all key stakeholders involved in a policy can help advocates for a given policy—such as military reform, water rights, or disability legislation—prepare to address different ideologies, capacities, or interests of key actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Harry|title=A Guide to Monitoring and Evaluating Policy Influence|journal=Overseas Development Institute|date=February 2011|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/6453.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Limiting stakeholder analysis only to government and official policymakers may ignore major groups that can support policy development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardee|first=Karen|author2=Imelda Feranil |author3=Jill Boezwinkle |author4=Benjamin Clark Benjamin |title=The Policy Circle: A Framework For Analyzing the Components of Family Planning, Reproductive Health, Maternal Health, and HIV/AIDS Policies|journal=Washington DC: Futures Group, Policy Project|year=2004|url=http://www.policyproject.com/pubs/workingpapers/wps-11.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy monitoring coalitions should agree on what they are monitoring and be succinct in their recommendations to policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Cecilia|author2=Craig Watkins|title=Conceptualizing Spatial Planning Outcomes: Towards an Integrative Measurement Framework|journal=The Town Planning Review|year=2009|volume=80|issue=4/5|url=https://www.questia.com/library/1P3-1899476771/conceptualising-spatial-planning-outcomes-towards}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Policy initiatives themselves are often controversial, and policy monitoring can be contentious because it shows how well policy implementers and enforcers are doing their jobs. Those conducting policy monitoring should be thorough in their data collection and unbiased in their presentation of facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Dan|title=The Dynamics of Political Control of the Bureaucracy|journal=The American Political Science Review|year=1991|volume=85|issue=3|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1963851?uid=3739584&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102625842527}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Robust trainings on policy monitoring work can help organizations be systematic and effective in their policy monitoring efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Harry|title=A Guide to Monitoring and Evaluating Policy Influence|journal=Overseas Development Institute|date=February 2011|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/6453.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Existing Models and Frameworks for Policy and Advocacy Monitoring ==
=== PEPFAR ===
The [[PEPFAR|United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR)’s Monitoring Policy Reform tool outlines the progression of policy development related to HIV from problem identification to [[Monitoring and Evaluation|monitoring and evaluation]]. The tool supports a relatively simple and uniform monitoring process which can be applied to any policy area. This tool can guide policy monitoring efforts throughout the policy reform process.

 PEPFAR’s six stages of the policy reform process:

:'''Stage 1''': Identify baseline policy issues by conducting situation assessment

:  '''Stage 2''': Engagement of stakeholders in developing common policy agenda

:  '''Stage 3''': Develop policy

:  '''Stage 4''': Official government endorsement of policy

:  '''Stage 5''': Implementation of policy

:  '''Stage 6''': Evaluation of policy implementation (PEPFAR)

=== [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FAPDA|journal=Food and Agriculture Organization|year=2013|url=http://www.fao.org/economic/fapda/en/|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Working Cycle for Country Approach ===
The FAO’s Food and Agriculture Policy Decision Analysis (FAPDA) is a policy monitoring tool that provides a working cycle technique to identify policy problems and improve analysis of policy issues. By incorporating FAPDA outputs, such as a web-based tool, country policy review, and policy analysis report, policy dialogue can be more systematic and encompass different actors interested in FAPDA data.

 The cycle includes:
  Phase 1: Preparatory Phase
  Phase 2: Focal Point Training
  Phase 3: Policy Identification
  Phase 4: Quality Control and Validation
  Phase 5: 1st Discussion Focus of Analysis
  Phase 6: Analysis
  Phase 7: 2nd Discussion on Findings (FAO)

=== World Health Organization ===
The World Health Organization has started to develop dedicated monitoring systems for policy interventions on the social determinants of health that improve health equity, such as social protection and gender equity policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2471/BLT.16.184622 |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/11/16-184622/en/ |title=The need to monitor actions on the social determinants of health |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=95 |issue=11 |pages=784-787 |year=2017 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Valentine |first2=Nicole |last3=Rasanathan |first3=Kumanan |last4=Hosseinpoor |first4=Ahmad Reza |last5=Neira |first5=Maria }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
=== Gender ===
Policy monitoring can be performed through different issue-driven lenses, such as gender sensitivity or gender equality. Gender-sensitive policy monitoring analyzes any gender aspects of a policy or policy issue, and considers the impact of the policy on both men and women, as well as its impact on gender relations. For example, a policy that is shown to have improved the welfare of a household may not necessarily affect all household members positively or equally, and may have even exacerbated gender inequity. Gender-sensitive policy monitoring can help advance gender equity and improve policy implementation. Civil society and other stakeholders can use policy monitoring techniques to systematically gather data on the gender aspects of policies and use these data to influence policymakers to favor  gender-equitable health policies¬¬¬—these processes are essential to facilitating [[gender mainstreaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Mohga Kamal|title=Enhancing Gender Equity in Health Programmes: Monitoring and Evaluation|journal=Gender and Development|year=2001|volume=9|issue=2|jstor=4030592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
A 2012 study analyzed planned policy interventions across the 22 publicly accessible PEPFAR Partnership Frameworks to understand how the interventions are related to PEPFAR and country or regional priorities. The study found that “policy monitoring by donors, partner country governments, and civil society stakeholders can help measure whether policy interventions are occurring as planned in order to further HIV prevention, care, and treatment and health system goals and, if not, can point to needed changes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Judice|first=Nicole|title=Monitoring HIV Policy Interventions in PEPFAR Partnership Frameworks|year=2012|volume=presented at Second Global Symposium on Health Systems Research in Beijing, China|url=http://www.healthpolicyproject.com/pubs/152_HSRPoster.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''President''' is a leader of an organization, company, community, club, trade union, university or other group. The relationship between the president and the [[Chief Executive Officer]] varies, depending on the structure of the specific organization. In a similar vein to the [[Chief Operating Officer]], the title of corporate President as a separate position (as opposed to being combined with a "[[Corporate_title#Senior_management|C-Suite]]" designation, such as "President and Chief Executive Officer" or "President and Chief Operating Officer") is also loosely defined; the President is usually the legally recognized highest rank of corporate officer, ranking above the various [[Vice_president#In_business|Vice Presidents]] (including Senior Vice President and Executive Vice President), but on its own generally considered subordinate, in practice, to the CEO. The powers of the president vary widely across organizations and such powers come from specific authorization in the bylaws (e.g. the president can make an "executive decision" only if the bylaws allow for it).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = [[Robert's Rules of Order]] Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 456|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally, the term "president" was used to designate someone who presided over a meeting, and was used in the same way that "foreman" or "overseer" is used now (the term is still used in that sense today).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='President' Once Meant Little More Than 'Foreman'|author=Guy Raz|date=December 14, 2013|work=npr.org|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=250990126|accessdate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/president?s=t|title = President|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-19|website = |publisher = Dictionary.com|quote = a person who presides.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has now also come to mean "chief officer" in terms of administrative or executive duties.

== Duties at meetings ==
[[File:AGM Annual General Meeting of a typical small (141 member) volunteer organisation.jpg|thumb|President presiding over the AGM of a small volunteer organization. President sitting at the left of table in the background]]
In addition to the administrative or executive duties in organizations, the president has the duties of presiding over meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such duties at meetings include:
* calling the meeting to order
* determining if a [[quorum]] is present
* announcing the items on the [[order of business]] or [[Agenda (meeting)|agenda]] as they come up
* [[Recognition (parliamentary procedure)|recognition]] of members to have the [[Floor (legislative)|floor]]
* enforcing the rules of the group
* putting all questions ([[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]]) to a vote
* adjourning the meeting
While presiding, the president should remain impartial and not interrupt a speaker if the speaker has the floor and is following the rules of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 44}}: "The presiding officer must never interrupt a speaker simply because he knows more about the matter than the speaker does."&lt;/ref&gt; In committees or small boards, the president votes along with the other members. However, in assemblies or larger boards, the president should vote only when it can affect the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#1|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 1)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-19|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a meeting, the president only has one vote (i.e. the president cannot vote twice and cannot override the decision of the group unless the organization has specifically given the president such authority).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Powers and authority ==
The powers of the president vary widely across organizations. In some organizations the president has the authority to hire staff and make financial decisions, while in others the president only makes recommendations to a [[board of directors]], and still others the president has no executive powers and is mainly a [[Spokesperson|spokesman]] for the organization. The amount of power given to the president depends on the type of organization, its structure, and the rules it has created for itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disciplinary procedures ==
If the president exceeds the given authority, engages in misconduct, or fails to perform the duties, the president may face disciplinary procedures. Such procedures may include [[censure]], suspension, or [[Declare the chair vacant|removal from office]]. The rules of the particular organization would provide details on who can perform these disciplinary procedures and the extent that they can be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 20)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-24|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, whoever appointed or elected the president has the power to discipline this officer.

== President-Elect ==
{{See also|-elect}}Some organizations may have a position of President-Elect in addition to the position of President. Generally the membership of the organization elects a President-Elect and when the term of the President-Elect is complete, that person automatically becomes President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immediate Past President ==
Some organizations may have a position of Immediate Past President in addition to the position of President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is the Immediate Past President? - Association of Information Technology Professionals|url = https://www.aitp.org/news/123604/|website = www.aitp.org|access-date = 2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = President-Elect/President/Immediate Past President|url = http://www.asha.org/About/governance/BOD/President/|website = www.asha.org|access-date = 2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = President-elect, President or Immediate Past President Position Description|url = http://www.eatrightpro.org/resource/leadership/nominations-and-elections/national-leadership-positions/president-elect-or-president-position-description|website = www.eatrightpro.org|access-date = 2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those organizations, when the term of the President is complete, that person automatically fills the position of Immediate Past President. The organization can have such a position only if the bylaws provide it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 572}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duties of such a position would also have to be provided in the bylaws.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Known customers (past, present and prospective)==
SA Waste is a registered contractor with Sabai (a [[townhouse]] complex in [[Randburg]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sapropex.com/sabai/our_team.html |title=Sabai – Our Team |publisher=Sabai |accessdate=2007-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305224046/http://www.sapropex.com/sabai/our_team.html |archivedate=5 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear what services they provide to Sabai, as Pikitup is the only company in Johannesburg that is permitted to collect waste form residential buildings.

According to the April/May 2000 issue of ''Vodaworld'' Magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explore-southafrica.co.za/natures_window/vodacom/recycle_email.htm |title=RECYCLING that e-mail you printed! |publisher=Explore South Africa |accessdate=2007-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113112624/http://www.explore-southafrica.co.za//natures_window/vodacom/recycle_email.htm |archivedate=13 November 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vodaworld.co.za/showarticle.asp?id=347|title=RECYCLING that e-mail you printed!|publisher=Vodaworld Online|author=Harding, James|accessdate=2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vodacom]] also counted themselves as a client. SA Waste was responsible for collecting waste from Vodacom's site on a daily basis, and transporting it to their recycling plant, where it would be sorted and sold to external recycling companies.

===Pikitup===
In 2006 to 2007, the company was a registered supplier to Pikitup, where they were awarded [[Call for bids|tender]] number PU 68/2003, providing hire of labour to the parastatal. This contract ended on February 28, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pikitup.co.za/upload/files/ContractsRegister.xls |format=Microsoft Excel |title=http://www.pikitup.co.za/upload/files/ContractsRegister.xls |publisher=Pikitup |accessdate=2007-12-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029184116/http://www.pikitup.co.za/upload/files/ContractsRegister.xls |archivedate=29 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SA Waste is in the process (as of March 2008) of tendering for another contract at Pikitup. This one will involve providing of a total refuse removal service (Including round-collected refuse removal, street cleaning, servicing of garden sites, and servicing [[Shanty town|informal settlements]]) for Johannesburg's [[Ivory Park, Gauteng|Ivory Park]] area. The closing date for bids on this tender was March 7, 2008, at 11:00 [[South African Standard Time|SAST]], and proposals are currently being considered.&lt;ref name=RenoxMolatedi /&gt; More information on this contract can be found at on the Pikitup website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pikitup.co.za/upload/files/Pu185bArea.pdf |title=PU185b/2008: TOTAL REFUSE REMOVAL FOR IVORY PARK AND ITS ENVIRONS |accessdate=2008-02-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227094724/http://www.pikitup.co.za/upload/files/Pu185bArea.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12204">In [[economics]], a firm will choose to implement a '''shutdown''' of production when the revenue received from the sale of the [[goods and services|goods or services]] produced cannot even cover the [[fixed cost]]s of production. In that situation, the firm will experience a higher loss when it produces, compared to not producing at all. 

Technically, shutdown occurs if [[marginal revenue]] is below [[average variable cost]] at the profit-maximizing positive level of output. Producing anything would not generate revenue significant enough to offset the associated variable costs; producing some output would add losses (additional costs in excess of revenues) to the costs inevitably being incurred (the [[fixed cost]]s). By not producing, the firm loses only the fixed costs.

==Explanation==

The goal of a firm is to maximize profits or minimize losses. The firm can achieve this goal by following two rules. First, the firm should operate, if at all, at the level of output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Second, the firm should shut down rather than operate if it can reduce losses by doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Perloff, J. (2009) p.231.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;Lovell (2004) p.243.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The shutdown rule===
Generally, a firm must have revenue &lt;math&gt;R \ge TC&lt;/math&gt;, total costs, in order to avoid losses. However, in the short run, all fixed costs are [[sunk cost]]s. Netting out fixed costs, a firm then faces the requirement that &lt;math&gt;R \ge VC&lt;/math&gt;, variable costs, in order to continue operating. Thus, a firm will find it more profitable to operate so long as the market price ''p ≥ AVC'', average variable cost.&lt;ref&gt;Revenue R = PQ, price times quantity. Average variable cost AVC = VC/Q, variable cost divided by quantity. Thus, ''R ≥ VC'' implies ''p ≥ AVC''.&lt;/ref&gt; Conventionally stated the shutdown rule is: "in the short run a firm should continue to operate if price exceeds average variable costs."&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, W &amp; Marks, S  (2003) p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Restated, the rule is that to produce in the short run a firm must earn sufficient revenue to cover its variable costs.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin &amp; Boyes, (2002) p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for the rule is straightforward. By shutting down a firm avoids all variable costs.&lt;ref&gt;Pindyck, R &amp; Rubinfeld, D:(2001) p.259.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the firm must still pay fixed costs.&lt;ref&gt;Pindyck, R &amp; Rubinfeld, D: (2001) p.259.&lt;/ref&gt; Because fixed cost must be paid regardless of whether a firm operates they should not be considered in deciding whether to produce or shut down.&lt;ref&gt;This version of the rule implicitly assumes that the firm has incurred sunk costs which are being amortized and treated as fixed costs. Or that fixed costs equal sunk costs. This assumption does not always hold. Sunk costs may have been incurred and paid for, or the cost of fixed inputs may be partially recoverable, through sale and salvage. If all fixed costs are recoverable, then the firm should shut down if price drops below average total costs rather than average variable costs. Pindyck, R &amp; Rubinfeld, D: (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus in determining whether to shut down a firm should compare total revenue to total variable costs (VC) rather than total costs (FC (fixed costs) + VC). If the revenue the firm is receiving is greater than its variable cost (R &gt; VC) then the firm is covering all variable cost plus there is additional revenue which partially or entirely offsets fixed costs.&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, W &amp; Marks, S  (2003) p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; (The size of the fixed costs is irrelevant as it is a [[sunk cost]].&lt;ref&gt;Perloff, J. (2009) p.237.&lt;/ref&gt; The same consideration is used whether fixed costs are one dollar or one million dollars.) On the other hand if VC &gt; R then the firm is not even covering its production costs and it should immediately shut down. The rule is conventionally stated in terms of price (average revenue) and average variable costs. The rules are equivalent&amp;mdash;if one divides both sides of inequality TR &gt; VC (total revenue exceeds variable costs) by the output quantity Q one obtains P &gt; AVC (price exceeds average variable cost)). If the firm decides to operate it will produce where marginal revenue equals marginal costs because these conditions insure profit maximization (or equivalently, when profit is negative, loss minimization).&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, W &amp; Marks, S (2006) p.286.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to state the rule is that a firm should compare the profits from operating to those realized if it shut down, and select the option that produces the greater profit (positive or negative).&lt;ref&gt;Png, I: 1999. p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landsburg, S (2002) p.193.&lt;/ref&gt; A firm that is shut down is generating zero revenue and incurring no variable costs. However the firm still incurs fixed cost.&lt;ref&gt;Bade and Parkin, pp. 353-54.&lt;/ref&gt; So the firm’s profit equals the negative of fixed costs or (- FC).&lt;ref&gt;Landsburg, S (2002) p.193&lt;/ref&gt; An operating firm is generating revenue, incurring variable costs and paying fixed costs. The operating firm's profit is R - VC - FC . The firm should continue to operate if R - VC - FC ≥ - FC which simplified is R ≥ VC.&lt;ref&gt;Png, I: (1999) p.102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landsburg, S (2002) p.194&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between revenue, R, and variable costs, VC, is the contribution toward offsetting fixed costs, and any positive contribution is better than none. Thus, if R ≥ VC then the firm should operate. If R &lt; VC the firm should shut down.

===Sunk costs===

An implicit assumption of the above rules is that all fixed costs are sunk costs. When some costs are sunk and some are not sunk,{{clarification needed|reason=explain how fixed costs can be non-sunk|date=September 2013}} total fixed costs (TFC) equal sunk fixed costs (SFC) plus non-sunk fixed costs (NSFC) or TFC = SFC + NSFC. When some fixed costs are non-sunk, the shutdown rule must be modified. As Besanko notes, to illustrate the new rule it is necessary to define a new cost curve, the average non-sunk cost curve, or ANSC. The ANSC equals the average variable costs plus the average non-sunk fixed cost or ANSC = AVC + ANFC.  The new rule then becomes: if the price is greater than the minimum average costs, produce; if the price is between minimum average costs and minimum ANSC produce, and if the price is less than minimum ANSC for all levels of production, shut down.&lt;ref&gt;Besanko and Braeutigam (2002) p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; If all fixed costs are non-sunk, then (a competitive) firm would shut down if the price were below average total costs.&lt;ref&gt;Pindyck, R &amp; Rubinfeld, D (2001) p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short-run shutdown compared to long-run exit==

A decision to shut down means that the firm is temporarily suspending production.&lt;ref&gt;Mnakiw, (2007) 296.&lt;/ref&gt; It does not mean that the firm is going out of business (exiting the industry).&lt;ref&gt;Landsburg, S (2002) p.193.&lt;/ref&gt; If market conditions improve, due to prices increasing or production costs falling, the firm can resume production. Shutting down is a short-run decision.&lt;ref&gt;Landsburg, S 2002.p.193.&lt;/ref&gt; A firm that has shut down is not producing, but it still retains its capital assets; however, the firm cannot leave the industry or avoid its fixed costs in the short run. 

However, a firm will not choose to incur losses indefinitely. In the long run, the firm will have to decide whether to continue in business or to leave the industry and pursue profits elsewhere. Exit is a long-term decision. A firm that has exited an industry has avoided all commitments and freed all capital for use in more profitable enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Landsburg, S (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; A firm that exits an industry earns no revenue but it incurs no costs, fixed or variable.&lt;ref&gt;Mankiw, N Principles of Microeconomics 4th ed. (Thomson 2007) p 298.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The long-run decision is based on the relationship of the price P and long-run average costs LRAC.&lt;ref&gt;In the long run there is no distinction between average variable costs and average costs because all costs are variable. Landsburg, S (2002) p.167&lt;/ref&gt; If P ≥ LRAC then the firm will not exit the industry. If P &lt; LRAC, then the firm will exit the industry. These comparisons will be made after the firm has made the necessary and feasible long-term adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;As Boyes notes the long run options of a firm are not limited to exiting or remaining in the industry - the  firm can " expand, contract, relocate, enter a new business, exit any line of business or quit doing business altogether."Boyes, W. (2004) p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the long run a firm operates where marginal revenue equals long-run marginal costs, but only if it decides to remain in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;Perloff, J:2008 page 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the firm's long-run supply curve is the long run marginal cost curve above the minimum point of the long run average cost curve.&lt;ref&gt;Landsburg, S (2002) p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monopolist Shutdown Rule==

A monopolist should shut down when price (average revenue) is less than average variable cost for every output level;&lt;ref&gt;Frank, R., (2008) Mc-Graw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; in other words, it should shut down if the demand curve is entirely below the average variable cost curve.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, R., (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Under these circumstances, even at the profit-maximizing level of output (where MR = MC, marginal revenue equals marginal cost) average revenue would be lower than average variable costs and the monopolist would be better off shutting down in the short run.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, R., (2008) (Mc-Graw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculating the shutdown point==

The short run shutdown point for a competitive firm is the output level at the minimum of the average variable cost curve. Assume that a firm's total cost function is TC = Q&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; -5Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; +60Q +125. Then its variable cost function is
Q&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; -5Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; +60Q, and its 
average variable cost function is (Q&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; -5Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; +60Q)/Q= Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; -5Q + 60. The slope of the average variable cost curve is the derivative of the latter, namely 2Q - 5. Equating this to zero to find the minimum gives Q = 2.5, at which level of output average variable cost is 53.75. Thus if the market price of the product drops below 53.75, the firm will choose to shut down production.

The long run shutdown point for a competitive firm is the output level at the minimum of the average total cost curve. Assume that a firm's total cost function is the same as above example. To find the shut down point in the long run, first take the derivative of ATC and then set it to zero and solve for Q. After getting Q plug it into the MC to get the price.

'''''Simutrans''''' is a [[cross-platform]] [[simulation game]] in which the player strives to run a successful transport system by constructing and managing transportation systems for passengers, mail and goods by land ([[Rail transport|rail]], [[Road transport|road]], [[tram]], [[monorail]], [[maglev]]), air ([[airplanes]]) and water ([[ship transport|ship]]) between places. Like ''[[OpenTTD]]'', ''Simutrans'' is an [[open-source software|open-source]] transportation game based on the ''[[Transport Tycoon]]'' idea.&lt;ref name="ff"&gt;{{cite web|title=Freeware Friday: Simutrans|url=http://news.bigdownload.com/2008/11/21/freeware-friday-simutrans|work=Big Download |publisher=GameDaily|author=James Murff|date=November 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development history ==
''Simutrans'' was originally written by Hansjörg Malthaner in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A short History of Simutrans Development |url=http://www.funkelwerk.de/site/index.php/projects/simutrans/years-1997-2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031184339/http://www.funkelwerk.de/site/index.php/projects/simutrans/years-1997-2001 |archivedate=October 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2004 he retired from development,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simutrans.com/en/about/ about - History] on simutrans.com&lt;/ref&gt; and an international community of volunteers took over the development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Simutrans Tikiwiki : Thanks|url=http://simutrans-germany.com/wiki/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Thanks|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227123033/http://www.simutrans-germany.com/wiki/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Thanks|archivedate=2011-12-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Simutrans'' was developed internally as a [[closed source]] game until 2007,&lt;ref name="license"&gt;{{cite web|title=Simutrans's Artistic License, SourceForge|url=http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/?&amp;fq&amp;#91;&amp;#93;=trove:17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706053607/http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/#91;&amp;|archivedate=2010-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the software was [[Software relicensing|relicensed]] under the [[Artistic License]].&lt;ref name="license"/&gt;

Simutrans is [[Source port|ported]] to [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], [[BeOS]]/[[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[AmigaOS 4|AmigaOS 4.x]] which make use of several graphics libraries such as [[Graphics Device Interface|GDI]] ([[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] only), [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]] (all versions) or [[Allegro library|Allegro]] (BeOS only). It is portable to any architecture using [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] and one of the aforementioned libraries. ''Simutrans'' has also [[multilingual]] support.

Currently the stable release of ''Simutrans'' is version 120.2.2 as of April 1, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forum.simutrans.com/index.php?topic=16909.0|title=Simutrans 120.2.2 r8163|last=|first=|date=|website=forum.simutrans.com|access-date=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a popular branch of the code called Simutrans-Extended, which aims to extend the basic game.&lt;ref name="experimental"&gt;[http://blog.simutrans.com/?tag=simutrans-experimental Simutrans Experimental]&lt;/ref&gt; Simutrans-Extended was formerly called Simutrans-Experimental, but changed its name to Simutrans-Extended on February 13, 2017 to make clear that it is a distinct [[Fork (software)|fork]] of Simutrans and not a testing branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forum.simutrans.com/index.php?topic=16685|title=Simutrans-Extended is the new name for Simutrans-Experimental|website=forum.simutrans.com|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daily build|Nightly builds]] for ''Simutrans'' and the main PakSets are also released for both standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Simutrans Nightly|url=http://simutrans-germany.com/~nightly/simutrans/index.php|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106124757/http://simutrans-germany.com/~nightly/simutrans/index.php|archivedate=2008-11-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Extended&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bridgewater-brunel.me.uk/downloads/nightly/|title=Index of /downloads/nightly|website=bridgewater-brunel.me.uk|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; versions.

==Overview and features==
[[File:Simutrans_101_map.png|thumb|Map of a Simutrans game world, showing cities and factories]]
The main goal in ''Simutrans'' is to provide an efficient transport system for passengers, mail and goods to be transported to their desired destinations fast and with minimal transfers and at the same time making the company grow avoiding [[bankruptcy]] or [[administration (law)|administration]].

''Simutrans'' has a number of factory chains that are interconnected with other chains, for example, a coal mine produces coal for a coal power plant, and an oil rig produces oil for an oil power plant. The goods produced by these factories may be distributed to smaller factories or shops, such as gasoline to a gas station, coming from a gas storage facility, which retrieves the gas from an oil refinery, and so on.

Supplying a factory with electric power will increase the production and allows for fine-tuning the economy. Passengers and mail are transported between different cities and tourist attractions, and may use several methods of transportation to reach their destinations.

The ''Simutrans'' executable can run many different paksets, which is a package containing files called paks. Paks are files with graphic and data files that Simutrans uses to determine the objects in the game, it determines things like their resolution, appearance and behaviors. Gaming experience is therefore very dependent on the PakSet used.

''Simutrans'' currently features 12 [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] players, and has an online capability similar to ''OpenTTD'' since version 110.0. The terrain in ''Simutrans'' is freely-modifiable, and different layers like tunnels and bridges can be stacked, allowing for subways or highways to be possible. It has a day and night cycle, different [[climate]]s and [[season]]s. Nearly all modes of transportation exist in ''Simutrans''. At least [[bus]]es/[[truck]]s, [[train]]s, and [[ship]]s are always provided. If defined in the PakSet, [[aircraft]], [[monorail]]s and/or [[maglev]]s can also be used.

==Customization==
[[File:Fuzzy bigundergroundhub.jpg|thumb|250px|Underground mode (pak128)]]
The ''Simutrans'' executable must load a PakSet which contains the game's objects. Over the years several PakSets have been created, an overview is given on the official page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PakSets|url=http://www.simutrans.com/paksets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Simutrans'' can easily be expanded or modified. Simple modification can be done via editing the personal config file. Since the objects in the game just consist of a simple image and a short description file, it is very easy to create a house or add a train. Thus many contributed objects for all graphic sizes exist. The user can also add height maps and citylists which add city names into the game. Even deep modifications of the game mechanics are possible via the config file, like a setting to prevent stockpiling at factories or changing the economic model simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Release of Simutrans 120.1.1|url=http://forum.simutrans.com/index.php?topic=14942.0|website=forum.simutrans.com|date=2015-11-20|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[GameDaily]]'s Big Download considered ''Simutrans'' to be one of the best [[freeware]] games, highlighting the logical system of routing passengers and freight to their destinations, decent AI opponents and the support for custom aesthetics or rules-sets. However, the sometimes unreliable vehicle pathfinding was criticized, particularly with respect to alternate routes and switches for train lines. The sound effects were deemed to be unengaging, and new players may be baffled by the range of transportation possibilities.&lt;ref name="ff" /&gt;

Another review from [[Amiga Future]] came to very similar conclusions (apart from the lack of sound support on [[Amiga OS]]). In particular the depth of simulation and the stability were highlighted.&lt;ref name="AF"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Amiga Future review|journal=Amiga Future|date=December 21, 2009|issue=82|pages=20–21|url=http://www.amigafuture.de/album_page.php?pic_id=14785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2007 and June 2017 Simutrans was downloaded from [[Sourceforge]] over 5.6 million times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/projects/simutrans/files/stats/timeline?dates=2001-07-10+to+2017-07-16 Simutrans - stats] on [[sourceforge.net]] (June 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

William E. Smith started the company with nine client organizations—headlined by the Popcorn, Seed Pea and Frozen Potato Products Institutes—and just 22 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ilesop.org/userfiles/file/SmithBucklin%20Company%20of%20the%20Year%20Application%202009.pdf|title=Illinois Chapter of The ESOP Association|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 24, 2004, Smith died at age 90.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2004-09-01|title=Community mourns for SmithBucklin co-founder.(Headlines)(Brief Article)(Obituary)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-122661994.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Dot-com bubble]] of 1997-2001, some of SmithBucklin's client associations encountered "painful" financial cutbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryjosephs/2014/06/11/smithbucklin-solving-the-chicken-and-egg-riddle-of-employee-ownership/#66bd0593c68f|title=SmithBucklin: Solving The Chicken-And-Egg Riddle Of Employee Ownership|last=Josephs|first=Mary|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-12-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2005, the company became employee-owned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.svoco.com/news/SaleofSmithBucklin.html|title=Svoboda, Collins L.L.C.

In 2011, SmithBucklin contracted for 111,081 square feet at Chicago's former IBM Building, 330 N. Wabash Ave., under a 15-year lease that was set to begin in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/realestate/20111229/CRED03/111229829/former-ibm-building-signs-smithbucklin|title=Former IBM Building signs SmithBucklin|website=Crain's Chicago Business|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SolvV''' is short for ''Solvabilitätsverordnung'' which means solvability directive in German, i.e. the [[Primary_and_secondary_legislation|delegated legislation]] of §§ 10 ff of the [[Kreditwesengesetz]] and in effect since 2006. The long name in German is ''Verordnung über die angemessene Eigenmittelausstattung von Instituten, Institutsgruppen und Finanzholding-Gruppen'', literally "directive on the appropriate setting of [[Equity (finance)|equity]] for (financial) institutes, groups of institutes and financial holding groups". There is an analogous directive with the same name in Austria.

'''Theodore Parker Smith''' was a leader at business colleges in the U.S. He ran Smith's Business College in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]]. 

== Early life ==
Smith was a Missouri native,{{cn|date=January 2018}} graduated from [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)]] in 1888&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Usa-_VgFkrgC|page=135}}|title=Nathan B.

== Career ==
An 1899 advertisement in the ''[[Richmond Planet]]'' announced that the school offered courses in “phonographic, penning, commercial, English…”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16497113/advertisement_richmond_planet/|title=[Advertisement] Richmond Planet (Richmond, Virginia) 22 Jul 1899, page 2 - Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1908 publication lauded Smith as “one of the pioneers” in the work of training African Americans in business principles.  

By 1897, he was a professor at a business college in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16496010/freom_lynchburg_richmond_planet/|title=From Lynchburg, Richmond Planet (Richmond, Virginia) 20 Nov 1897, page 4 - Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later served as president and manager of Smith's Business College in Lynchburg where he taught stenography and bookkeeping. In 1910, Smith left that position to join the faculty of the National Religious Training School (a predecessor of [[North Carolina Central University]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16496828/able_addresses_richmond_planet/|title=Able Addresses, Richmond Planet (Richmond, Virginia) 6 Aug 1910, page 5 - Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 1911 they had moved to Durham, North Carolina, where he was the Dean of the Commercial Department at the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16497659/|title=Clipping from The Wilmington Morning Star - Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clara served as the head of the Teacher’s Department.&lt;ref&gt;Begin Second Year of Training School, Winston-Salem Journal (Winston-Salem, North Carolina) 12 Oct 1911, page 7, accessed January 13, 2018 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16497803/&lt;/ref&gt; He taught at the North Carolina State Summer School for Negro Teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16497854/summer_school_at_greensboro_the_new/|title=Summer School at Greensboro, The New York Age (New York, New York) 1 Aug 1912, page 8 - Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tongsun Park''' (born 1935 in [[Sunchon, North Korea|Sunch'ŏn]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]]), also known as '''Pak Dong-seon''', was a [[South Korea]]n [[lobbyist]]. He was involved in two political money-related scandals: [[Koreagate]] in the 1970s, and the [[Oil-for-Food Program]] scandal of the 2000s. Park had a reputation as the "Asian [[Jay Gatsby|Great Gatsby]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan |first=Dan |date=1979 |title=Merchants of Grain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xLszAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Viking Press |page=289 |isbn=978-0670471508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Koreagate==
In 1976, Park was charged with bribing members of the [[U.S. Congress]], using money from the South Korean government, in a successful effort to convince the United States government to keep United States troops in South Korea. In 1977, he was indicted by a U.S. District Court on thirty-six counts, including [[bribery]], illegal campaign contributions, [[mail fraud]], [[racketeering]], and failure to register as an agent of the [[Korean Central Intelligence Agency]]. He avoided a federal trial by testifying to the court in exchange for [[immunity from prosecution|immunity]]. His testimony did not have a major impact, though it led to three members of Congress getting reprimanded, and may have convinced [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Carl Albert]] not to seek re-election.  One of the implicated former representatives, [[Otto Passman]] of [[Louisiana's 5th congressional district]] based about [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], was charged with conspiracy, bribery, acceptance of an illegal gratuity, and [[income tax evasion]]. When his trial was moved from [[Washington, D.C.]], to Monroe, Passman was quickly acquitted.&lt;ref name=oepassman&gt;Billy Hathorn, "Otto Passman, Jerry Huckaby, and Frank Spooner: The Louisiana Fifth Congressional District Campaign of 1976", ''Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association,'' Vol. LIV, No. 3 (Summer 2013), pp. 341-342&lt;/ref&gt;
Explained [[William G. Hundley]], a former organized crime investigator for the U.S. Senate who attended the Passman trial:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I went there for the trial, and I'd go into restaurants with Park, and people would get up and leave. ... I thought the prosecution presented a pretty good case. But when the defense attorney, [[Camille Gravel]], got up to cross-examine Tongsun Park, he carried a big map of Korea. He didn't even tough the merits of the case. He identified South Korea and noted that it's right under North Korea and next to China. Then he pointed out that North Korea and China are [[totalitarian]] communist states. The jury was out less than ninety minutes, and they acquitted Passman on every charge.&lt;ref name=oepassman/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Oil-for-food scandal==
In 1992, Park was approached by [[Samir Vincent]], an [[Iraqi American|Iraqi-born American]] who was lobbying unofficially on behalf of the [[Saddam Hussein]] regime, to try to create a program that would bypass the [[United Nations]]-approved [[Iraq sanctions|economic sanctions of Iraq]] that had started in 1991. Park agreed, requesting a payment of US$10 million for his effort, to which Vincent agreed. Park served as a liaison between Vincent and then-[[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], with whom Park was friendly. In late 1996, partly as a result of Park's lobbying efforts, the U.N. [[Oil-for-Food Program]] began. After 1997, when [[Kofi Annan]] became the new secretary-general, the government of Iraq dropped its ties with Park; by then Park had received about US$2 million in payments.

In 2005 Park was accused of acting as an intermediary with corrupt [[United Nations]] officials in the [[oil-for-food]] conspiracy orchestrated by [[Saddam Hussein]]. His name surfaced as part of investigations into the oil-for-food scandal. In July 2006 he was convicted in a U.S. federal court on [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |date= July 13, 2006| last=Associated Press|title= Korean businessman guilty in oil-for-food case | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13849968/|publisher= MSNBC |accessdate=2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the first person convicted through the oil-for-food investigation.  On February 22, 2007, he was sentenced to five years in prison. He also was fined $15,000 and required to forfeit $1,200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= Lynch| first= Colum| author-link= | date= February 23, 2007| title= Park Sentenced to 5 Years in U.N.

The next day, he left the United States for South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |date=2008-09-15 |publisher=국민일보 코리안 데일리 뉴스 |script-title=ko:코리아 게이트 박동선씨 귀국 |url=http://koreandailynews.net/print_paper.php?number=2097 |language=Korean |accessdate=2010-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320014518/http://koreandailynews.net/print_paper.php?number=2097 |archive-date=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''union shop''', also known as a '''post-entry closed shop''', is a form of a [[union security agreement|union security]] clause. Under this, the employer agrees to either only hire [[trade union|labor union]] members or to require that any new employees who are not already union members become members within a certain amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Jentz, p. 942; Rees, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the union shop varies widely from nation to nation, depending on the level of protection given trade unions in general.

==Canada==
In 1946, Justice [[Ivan Rand]] of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] crafted what became known as the "[[Rand formula]]". Appointed as arbiter to settle the [[Ford Strike of 1945]], Rand concluded that both federal and provincial labor law made strong trade unions national policy. If workers were allowed to opt out of paying union dues, the [[free rider problem]] would undermine this policy. Rand went further to argue that the free rider problem undermines workplace order by causing resentment between union and non-union employees.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, p. 327-328.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand's decision required all workers to pay union dues, but protected the right of workers to not join the union or otherwise participate in sustaining it. In the late 1940s and 1950s, many Canadian provinces incorporated the "Rand formula" into their labor laws. By 1997, the federal government and six provinces ([[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], and [[Saskatchewan]]) imposed the Rand formula on labor relations. Most of the laws provided for a religious exemption that imposed donation to a charity rather than union dues.&lt;ref name="Kaufman328"&gt;Kaufman, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1994, 9 percent of collective bargaining agreements in Canada required the [[closed shop]], while 42.3 percent required the union shop and 39.2 percent used the Rand formula. Just 3 percent used the [[agency shop]], while 6.5 percent had the [[open shop]].&lt;ref name="Kaufman328" /&gt; [[Alberta]] appointed an investigative committee in 1994 to see if adoption of American-style [[Right-to-work law|"right to work" laws]] would benefit the province. The committee strongly rejected the policy after Albertan employers strongly supported the union shop.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, p. 328-330.&lt;/ref&gt; Union shop clauses in Canadian collective bargaining agreements were enforceable.&lt;ref&gt;Western, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The closed shop is legal in all Canadian jurisdictions as of 2006, and unions may (if they wish) negotiate forms of union security agreements that provide less than the union shop.&lt;ref&gt;Morely, Gunnigle, and Collings, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan==
Article 7, Section 1 of the [[Trade Union Act of 1949]] of [[Japan]] specifically permits the negotiation of union shop provisions, provided that the union represents a majority of workers at the worksite. However, Article 28 of the [[Constitution of Japan]] protects freedom of association. Japanese courts have wrestled with the two conflicting legal values, and found that the right to organize is superior to the right to freedom of association.&lt;ref name="Hanami" /&gt; However, court have crafted five conditions for a union shop agreement to be accepted:&lt;ref&gt;Kagawa, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

#Workers must remain free to join a union that does not represent a majority of workers in the plant.
#If a worker withdraws from the majority union to join the minority union, the union shop agreement may no longer cover the withdrawing worker.
#New workers retain the right to join a union that does not represent a majority of workers in the plant, and cannot be forced to join the majority union.
#The union shop agreement is nullified if a union no longer represents a majority of workers at the worksite.
#If a worker withdraws from the majority union to form a new union, the union shop agreement may no longer cover the withdrawing worker.

Article 17 of the Trade Union Act requires that the collective bargaining agreement be extended to all workers of the same type if 75 percent of that class of the employer's workers are already covered by the agreement. Although this may appear to impose the union shop, in practice defining what constitutes a "similar type of worker" has proven too difficult and Section 17 is rarely enforced.&lt;ref name="Nakakubo"&gt;Nakakubo, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, 62.1 percent of all Japanese collective bargaining agreements contained a union shop provision.&lt;ref name="Hanami"&gt;Hanami and Komiya, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1999, 60 percent did so.&lt;ref name="Nakakubo" /&gt; Other forms of union security agreements, such as the closed shop and agency shop, are extremely rare.&lt;ref name="Hanami" /&gt;

Japanese labor law treats large employers differently from small employers, and union shop provisions are much less likely to be negotiated in small workplaces. For example, Chalmers cites 1979 data showing that 50 percent of all workplaces in Japan had a union shop provision. But while 73 percent of employers with more than 1,000 workers had such agreements, just 59 percent of employers with 500 to 999 workers did so. Some agreements are ambiguously worded, making their enforcement problematic. Other union shop provisions are tied to various requirements that the union promote "industrial peace", such as mandatory arbitration for all disputes and a relinquishment of the right to strike.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
The [[Labor Management Relations Act of 1947]] (also known as the Taft-Hartley Act) made the [[closed shop]] illegal in the United States. Subsequently, the Union Shop was also deemed to be illegal.&lt;ref name="Pattern Makers v. NLRB"&gt;{{Cite web  |title = Pattern Makers v. NLRB, 473 U.S. 95, 126 (1985)|url = http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=473&amp;invol=95|publisher = U.S. Supreme Court|date = June 27, 1985|accessdate = 10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court in ''[[Pattern Makers v. NLRB]]'', 473 U.S. 95 (1985), also held that a union member may resign from the union at any time without notice, thereby enabling the worker to work during a strike without being subject to sanctions from the union.&lt;ref name="Pattern Makers v. NLRB" /&gt; Under the [[National Labor Relations Act]] (NLRA), as amended by the Taft-Hartley Act, and held by the Supreme Court in [[Communications Workers of America v. Beck]] that in a union security agreement, unions are authorized by statute to collect from non-members only those fees and dues necessary to perform its duties as a collective bargaining representative known as [[agency fee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | title = COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS v. BECK, 487 U.S. 735 (1988) | url = http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=487&amp;invol=735 | publisher = U.S. Supreme Court | date = June 29, 1988 | accessdate = 10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compelling payment of agency fees from non-union employees in the public sector was held unconstitutional in [[Janus v. AFSCME]], in June 2018. The agency fee is only that portion of union dues that is attributable to the cost of representing employees in collective bargaining and in providing services to all represented employees, but not, with certain exceptions, to the union's political activities or organizing employees of other employers. Additional restrictions apply to unions covered by the [[Railway Labor Act]] (RLA) and unionized governmental employees.

The NLRA requires that employees must be given at least 30 days from the date of hire to join the union before they may be subject to being fired for failure to join the union or pay dues; shorter periods apply in the construction industry. The RLA gives employees 60 days to join the union. The union cannot, however, require that an employee become a member "in good standing" — that is, do more than pay dues or their equivalent. While a union shop agreement that, by its literal terms, requires an employee to become a member in good standing might appear to be unlawful on its face and therefore unenforceable, the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) and the courts have uniformly interpreted such clauses to require no more than what the law permits (such as  payment of dues).

Under [[United States labor law]], a private sector union can expel a member from the union for any number of reasons, so long as it provides the member with the minimum due process required by the [[Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act]] (LMRDA) and does not do so for reasons prohibited by law (such as the member's race or protected political activities within the union). The union cannot, on the other hand, use a union shop agreement to require an employer to discharge a member for failure to maintain membership in good standing unless that member has been expelled from the union for failure to pay uniformly required union dues and fees. If the union expels a member for some reason other than failure to pay dues, it effectively terminates any right it might have had to demand that the employee pay dues thereafter or request that the employee be discharged for failure to do so.

The NLRA imposes additional requirements before a union can invoke a union shop agreement clause to require an employer to fire an employee who has failed to pay dues. While the union does not have to give the individual employee the sort of trial-type hearing required by the LMRDA to expel a union member for other reasons, the union must give the employee a detailed written explanation of the amount of delinquent dues that the employee owes and how those dues were calculated, and allow the employee a reasonable opportunity to pay those delinquent dues and fees before it asks that the employee be fired. In addition, the union must give all employees roughly the same opportunity to cure any delinquencies before requesting discharge; if the union gives one employee two weeks to pay delinquent dues, it must do the same for all others. The union is not, on the other hand, required to withdraw a request that an employee be fired for failure to pay delinquent dues if the employee makes the payment after the deadline but before the employer has effected the discharge. A union may owe back pay to employees who have been fired without these procedural protections; the employer may be liable if it effects the discharge when it knew or should have known that the union had not complied with the minimum requirements of the NLRA.

Under the NLRA, the union may demand payment only of those dues for periods when an employee was covered by a collective bargaining agreement that contained a valid union shop agreement.  A union shop agreement may not be made retroactive to a period prior to the execution of the agreement. The union may not demand that an employee be fired for failure to pay extraordinary assessments that are not part of regularly, uniformly imposed dues. The LMRDA sets standards for the procedures that the union must follow when asking members to approve an increase in dues.

Union-represented employees covered by a union shop agreement may ask the NLRB to hold a "deauthorization election" to allow all bargaining unit employees to vote to determine whether the clause will continue to remain in effect. No such procedure exists under the RLA.

==United Kingdom==
The term "union shop" is not used in the UK but it appears to be equivalent to a post-entry [[closed shop]].

==Holy See==
The lay employees of the Vatican are members of a union shop, the [[Association of Vatican Lay Workers]], making the Vatican the world's most unionized sovereign state.
