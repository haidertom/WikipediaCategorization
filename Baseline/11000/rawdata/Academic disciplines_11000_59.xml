'''Alvéole''' is a French company based in Paris and founded in 2010 by Quattrocento&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usinenouvelle.com/article/quattrocento-leve-5-2-millions-d-euros-pour-developper-des-medtechs.N402482|title=Quattrocento lève 5,2 millions d'euros pour développer des medtechs.|last=Arnaud,|first=Dumas|date=July 16, 2016|work=L'USINE NOUVELLE|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a business accelerator company in the life science field, in collaboration with researchers from the [[French National Center for Scientific Research]] with expertise in [[bioengineering]] and cell imaging.

Alvéole is specialized in the development of devices for controlling microenvironment ''in vitro''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://labiotech.eu/micropatterning-cells/|title=Here’s a Flashy New Technique to Model Disease|last=|first=|date=October 26, 2017|work=Labiotech.eu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Its first product is PRIMO: a contactless and maskless photopatterning device allowing researchers to control the [[topography]] (via [[microfabrication]]) and [[biochemistry]] (via [[micropatterning]]) of cell [[Microenvironment (biology)|microenvironment]].

== Products ==
Alvéole's first product is PRIMO, a photopatterning device which can be docked on standard [[Inverted microscope|inverted microscopes]]. PRIMO photopatterning technique is based on LIMAP technology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strale|first=Pierre-Olivier|last2=Azioune|first2=Ammar|last3=Bugnicourt|first3=Ghislain|last4=Lecomte|first4=Yohan|last5=Chahid|first5=Makhlad|last6=Studer|first6=Vincent|date=2015-12-21|title=Multiprotein Printing by Light-Induced Molecular Adsorption|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.201504154|journal=Advanced Materials|language=en|volume=28|issue=10|pages=2024–2029|doi=10.1002/adma.201504154|issn=0935-9648}}&lt;/ref&gt; and combines a maskless and contactless [[photolithography]] system controlled by a dedicated software (Leonardo) and a specific photo-initiator (PLPP). This system modulate UV-light illumination through an array of micromirrors ([[Digital micromirror device|DMD]]). The UV light is then projected through the objective of the microscope onto the substrate in order to either perform microfabrication or protein micropatterning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pierre-Olivier Strale, Matthieu Opitz, Marie-Charlotte Manus, Grégoire Peyret, Aurélien Duboin, Louise Bonnemay, Josselin Ruaudel|first=|date=May 2018|title=Controlling the topography and biochemistry of cell culture substrates with PRIMO® photopatterning system|url=|journal=Nature Methods|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

- [[Microfabrication]]: The modulated UV light is projected on a photosensitive resist. The cured [[photoresist]] can then be used as a mold to deposit [[Polydimethylsiloxane|PDMS]] and generate microstructured PDMS chips.

- Protein [[micropatterning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nanoscalelabs.com/micropatterning.html|title=Micropatterning|last=|first=|date=2017|website=nanoscaleLABS|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;: The modulated UV light is projected onto a standard cell culture [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] previously coated with an anti-fouling polymer and reacts with the PLPP photo-initiator to locally degrade this coating. [[Adhesion protein]]s can then be adsorbed on the illuminated area only, allowing for the creation of proteins micropatterns on which cells can adhere.

== Applications ==
By [[micropatterning]] [[Adhesion protein|adhesions proteins]] with a sub-cellular resolution, PRIMO enables to control [[Cell adhesion|cell adhesio]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n and isolate single cells under highly reproducible conditions. This allows cell biology researchers from various fields – such as [[mechanobiology]], [[toxicology]], [[immunology]], [[oncology]] or [[neuroscience]]s – to control or study intracellular mechanisms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delépine|first=Chloé|last2=Meziane|first2=Hamid|last3=Nectoux|first3=Juliette|last4=Opitz|first4=Matthieu|last5=Smith|first5=Amos B.|last6=Ballatore|first6=Carlo|last7=Saillour|first7=Yoann|last8=Bennaceur-Griscelli|first8=Annelise|last9=Chang|first9=Qiang|date=2015-11-24|title=Altered microtubule dynamics and vesicular transport in mouse and human MeCP2-deficient astrocytes|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddv464|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=146–157|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddv464|issn=0964-6906|pmc=4690499|pmid=26604147}}&lt;/ref&gt; or screen the effect of molecules on cell functions.

On a larger scale, PRIMO also makes it possible to control complex cellular arrangements, to study [[cell migration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/51002/title/Image-of-the-Day--Cell-Dance-/|title=Image of the Day: Cell Dance|last=|first=|date=November 24, 2017|work=The Scientist|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[axon guidance]].

Furthermore,the micropatterning process with PRIMO can be performed on microstructures' sides, top or bottom, making it possible to confine single cells or multicellular arrangements in three-dimension&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite biorxiv|last=Stoecklin|first=Celine|last2=Yue|first2=Zhang|last3=Chen|first3=Wilhelm W.|last4=Mets|first4=Richard de|last5=Fong|first5=Eileen|last6=Studer|first6=Vincent|last7=Viasnoff|first7=Virgile|date=2018-03-28|title=A new approach to design artificial 3D micro-niches with combined chemical, topographical and rheological cues|biorxiv=291104}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

One last known possible application is the [[photopolymerization]] of photo-sensitive materials, such as resins for microfabrication or photosensitive hydrogel to include [[rheological]] cues in cell microenvironment&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or to create permeable membranes in microfluidic channels&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Decock|first=Jérémy|last2=Schlenk|first2=Mathias|last3=Salmon|first3=Jean-Baptiste|date=2018|title=In situ photo-patterning of pressure-resistant hydrogel membranes with controlled permeabilities in PEGDA microfluidic channels|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C7LC01342F|journal=Lab on a Chip|language=en|volume=18|issue=7|pages=1075–1083|doi=10.1039/c7lc01342f|issn=1473-0197}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3490">'''Biomusicology''' is the study of [[music]] from a [[Biology|biological]] point of view. The term was coined by Nils L. Wallin in 1991 to encompass several branches of [[music psychology]] and [[musicology]], including [[evolutionary musicology]], [[Cognitive neuroscience of music|neuromusicology]], and [[ethnomusicology|comparative musicology]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallin, N. L. (1991): ''Biomusicology: Neurophysiological, Neuropsychological and Evolutionary Perspectives on the Origins and Purposes of Music'', Stuyvesant, NY: Pendragon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary musicology studies the "origins of music, the question of animal song, selection pressures underlying music evolution", and "music evolution and human evolution". Neuromusicology studies the "brain areas involved in music processing, neural and cognitive processes of musical processing", and "ontogeny of musical capacity and musical skill". Comparative musicology studies the "functions and uses of music, advantages and costs of music making", and "universal features of musical systems and musical behavior".&lt;ref name="Brown, Merker, Wallin"&gt;Wallin, Nils L./Björn Merker/Steven Brown (1999): "An Introduction to Evolutionary Musicology." In: Wallin, Nils L./Björn Merker/Steven Brown (Eds., 1999): ''The Origins of Music'', pp. 5–6. {{ISBN|0-262-23206-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied biomusicology "attempts to provide biological insight into such things as the [[Music therapy|therapeutic uses of music]] in medical and psychological treatment; widespread use of music in the audiovisual media such as film and television; the ubiquitous [[Background music|presence of music in public places]] and its role in influencing mass behavior; and the potential use of music to function as a general enhancer of learning."&lt;ref name="Brown, Merker, Wallin"/&gt;

Whereas biomusicology refers to music among humans, [[zoomusicology]] extends the field to other species.

'''Charismatic megafauna''' are [[megafauna|large animal species]] with [[symbol|symbolic value]], widespread popular appeal, and are often used by environmental activists to achieve [[environmentalist]] goals.&lt;ref name="Charisma"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ducarme |first=Frédéric |last2=Luque |first2=Gloria M. |last3=Courchamp |first3=Franck |year=2013 |title=What are "charismatic species" for conservation biologists ? |url=http://biologie.ens-lyon.fr/biologie/ressources/bibliographies/pdf/m1-11-12-biosci-reviews-ducarme-f-2c-m.pdf?lang=en |journal=BioSciences Master Reviews |volume=10 |pages=1–8 |doi= |accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[humpback whale]], [[giant panda]], [[bald eagle]], [[California condor]], [[harp seal]], and [[penguin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kaufman, Donald G. |author2=Franz, Cecilia M. |title=Biosphere 2000: Protecting Our Global Environment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xBG99KR52mgC&amp;pg=PA342 |date=2000 |publisher=Kendall Hunt Publishing Company |isbn=978-0-7872-5713-2 |page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguins in peril |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/1999/mar/27/naturaldisasters.world |website=The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paradoxically, numerous charismatic species are [[Endangered species|endangered]] by [[hunting]] and [[black market]] commerce.&lt;ref name="Courchamp2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Courchamp |first1=F. |last2=Jaric |first2=I. |last3=Albert |first3=C. |last4=Meinard |first4=Y. |last5=Ripple |first5=W. J.|last6=Chapron |first6=G. |date=2018 |title=The paradoxical extinction of the most charismatic animals |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003997 |journal=[[PLOS Biology]] |volume=16 |issue=4 |page=e2003997 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003997 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in conservation ==
Charismatic species are often used as [[flagship species]] in conservation programs, as they are supposed to attract people's feelings more.&lt;ref name="Charisma"/&gt; However, being charismatic does not protect species against [[extinction]]: all of the 10 most charismatic species are currently [[endangered]], and only the giant panda shows a demographic growth from an extremely small population.&lt;ref name=Courchamp2018/&gt;

Beginning early in the 20th century, efforts to reintroduce extirpated charismatic megafauna to ecosystems have been an interest of a number of private and non-government conservation organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Miller |first=C. R.  |author2=Waits, L. P. |author3=Joyce, P. |title = Phylogeography and mitochondrial diversity of extirpated brown bear (''Ursus arctos'') populations in the contiguous United States and Mexico | journal = Molecular Ecology |volume =15 | issue=14  | pages =4477–4485 |date=2006 | doi =10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03097.x | pmid =17107477}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Species have been reintroduced from [[captive breeding]] programs in zoos, such as the European bison to Poland's [[Białowieża Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mysterud | first =A. |author2=Bartoń, K. A. |author3=Jędrzejewska, B. |author4=Krasiński, Z. A. |author5=Niedziałkowska, M. |author6=Kamler, J. F. |author7=Yoccoz, N. G. |author8=Stenseth, N. C. | title=Population ecology and conservation of endangered megafauna: the case of European bison in Białowiez’a Primeval Forest, Poland |journal=Animal Conservation |volume=10 | issue=1| pages=77–87 |year =2007 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-1795.2006.00075.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These and other reintroductions of charismatic megafauna, such as [[Przewalski's horse]] to [[Mongolia]], have been to areas of limited, and often patchy range compared to the historic ranges of the respective species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rugenstein | first =Dustin R. |author2=Rubenstein, Daniel I. |author3=Sherman, Paul W. |author4=Gavin, Thomas A.  |title=Pleistocene Park: Does re-wilding North America represent sound conservation for the 21st century? |journal=Biological Conservation |volume=132 |issue=2 |pages=232–238 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2006.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental activists and proponents of [[ecotourism]] seek to use the leverage provided by charismatic and well-known species to achieve more subtle and far-reaching goals in species and biodiversity conservation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} By directing public attention to the diminishing numbers of giant panda due to [[habitat loss]], for example, conservation groups can raise support for the protection of the panda and for the entire [[ecosystem]] of which it is a part.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} (The giant panda is portrayed in the logo of the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]].)

== Taxonomic bias ==
Charismatic megafauna may be subject to [[taxonomic inflation]], in that taxonomists will declare a [[subspecies]] to be a [[species]] because of the advocacy benefits of a unique species, rather than because of new scientific evidence.&lt;ref name="econ"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9191545 "Species inflation: Hail Linnaeus"], ''[[The Economist]]'', May 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The public's preference to identify with species sold through the [[ecotourism]] industry may be a factor for creating taxonomic inflation.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt; In the public perception, ecotourism may be about seeing species, and the number of unique species increases the perceived [[biodiversity]] and tourism [[Value (economics)|value]] of an area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Higham | first =James | title = Critical Issues in Ecotourism: understanding a complex tourism phenomenon | publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |year =2007 |location = |pages =76–77 | isbn =0-7506-6878-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last =Weaver | first=D. | title=Ecotourism | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons Australia Ltd |year=2002 |isbn =0-471-42230-4 |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; A correlation may exist between the taxonomic bias in biodiversity datasets and the charisma of terrestrial megafauna, with the more charismatic species being largely over-reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 =Monsarrat |last2 =Kerley| first1=S. | first2=G.I.H | title=Charismatic species of the past: Biases in reporting of large mammals in historical written sources| journal= Biological Conservation |year=2018| volume=223 | DOI= 10.1016/j.biocon.2018.04.036 | page=68-75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computational phylogenetics''' is the application of computational [[algorithm]]s, methods, and programs to [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analyses. The goal is to assemble a [[phylogenetic tree]] representing a hypothesis about the evolutionary ancestry of a set of [[gene]]s, [[species]], or other [[taxa]]. For example, these techniques have been used to explore the family tree of [[hominid]] species&lt;ref name="Strait"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Strait | first1 = DS | last2 = Grine | first2 = FE | year = 2004 | title = Inferring hominoid and early hominid phylogeny using craniodental characters: the role of fossil taxa | url = | journal = J Hum Evol | volume = 47 | issue = 6| pages = 399–452 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.08.008 | pmid=15566946}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the relationships between specific genes shared by many types of organisms.&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hodge | first1 = T | last2 = Cope | first2 = MJ | year = 2000 | title = A myosin family tree | url = | journal = J Cell Sci | volume = 113 | issue = | pages = 3353–3354 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional phylogenetics relies on [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] data obtained by measuring and quantifying the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] properties of representative organisms, while the more recent field of molecular phylogenetics uses [[nucleotide]] sequences encoding genes or [[amino acid]] sequences encoding [[protein]]s as the basis for classification. Many forms of molecular phylogenetics are closely related to and make extensive use of [[sequence alignment]] in constructing and refining phylogenetic trees, which are used to classify the evolutionary relationships between homologous [[gene]]s represented in the [[genome]]s of divergent species. The phylogenetic trees constructed by computational methods are unlikely to perfectly reproduce the [[evolutionary tree]] that represents the historical relationships between the species being analyzed. The historical species tree may also differ from the historical tree of an individual homologous gene shared by those species.

==Types of phylogenetic trees and networks==
[[Phylogenetic tree]]s generated by computational phylogenetics can be either ''rooted'' or ''unrooted'' depending on the input data and the algorithm used. A rooted tree is a [[directed graph]] that explicitly identifies a [[most recent common ancestor]] (MRCA), usually an imputed sequence that is not represented in the input. Genetic distance measures can be used to plot a tree with the input sequences as [[leaf node]]s and their distances from the root proportional to their [[genetic distance]] from the hypothesized MRCA. Identification of a root usually requires the inclusion in the input data of at least one "outgroup" known to be only distantly related to the sequences of interest.

By contrast, unrooted trees plot the distances and relationships between input sequences without making assumptions regarding their descent. An unrooted tree can always be produced from a rooted tree, but a root cannot usually be placed on an unrooted tree without additional data on divergence rates, such as the assumption of the [[molecular clock]] hypothesis.&lt;ref name="mount"&gt;Mount DM. (2004). ''Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis'' 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press: Cold Spring Harbor, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The set of all possible phylogenetic trees for a given group of input sequences can be conceptualized as a discretely defined multidimensional "tree space" through which search paths can be traced by [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] algorithms. Although counting the total number of trees for a nontrivial number of input sequences can be complicated by variations in the definition of a tree topology, it is always true that there are more rooted than unrooted trees for a given number of inputs and choice of parameters.&lt;ref name="felsenstein"&gt;Felsenstein J. (2004). ''Inferring Phylogenies'' Sinauer Associates: Sunderland, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees can be further generalized to rooted or unrooted [[phylogenetic network]]s, which allow for the modeling of evolutionary phenomena such as [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridization]] or [[horizontal gene transfer]].

==Coding characters and defining homology==
===Morphological analysis===
The basic problem in morphological phylogenetics is the assembly of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] representing a mapping from each of the taxa being compared to representative measurements for each of the phenotypic characteristics being used as a classifier. The types of phenotypic data used to construct this matrix depend on the taxa being compared; for individual species, they may involve measurements of average body size, lengths or sizes of particular bones or other physical features, or even behavioral manifestations. Of course, since not every possible phenotypic characteristic could be measured and encoded for analysis, the selection of which features to measure is a major inherent obstacle to the method. The decision of which traits to use as a basis for the matrix necessarily represents a hypothesis about which traits of a species or higher taxon are evolutionarily relevant.&lt;ref name="Swiderski"&gt;Swiderski DL, Zelditch ML, Fink WL. (1998). Why morphometrics is not special: coding quantitative data for phylogenetic analysis. 47(3):508-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Morphological studies can be confounded by examples of [[convergent evolution]] of phenotypes.&lt;ref name="Gaubert"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gaubert | first1 = P | last2 = Wozencraft | first2 = WC | last3 = Cordeiro-Estrela | first3 = P | last4 = Veron | first4 = G | year = 2005 | title = Mosaics of convergences and noise in morphological phylogenies: what's in a viverrid-like carnivoran? | url = | journal = Syst Biol | volume = 54 | issue = 6| pages = 865–894 | doi=10.1080/10635150500232769| pmid = 16282167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major challenge in constructing useful classes is the high likelihood of inter-taxon overlap in the distribution of the phenotype's variation. The inclusion of extinct taxa in morphological analysis is often difficult due to absence of or incomplete [[fossil]] records, but has been shown to have a significant effect on the trees produced; in one study only the inclusion of extinct species of [[ape]]s produced a morphologically derived tree that was consistent with that produced from molecular data.&lt;ref name="Strait" /&gt;

Some phenotypic classifications, particularly those used when analyzing very diverse groups of taxa, are discrete and unambiguous; classifying organisms as possessing or lacking a tail, for example, is straightforward in the majority of cases, as is counting features such as eyes or vertebrae. However, the most appropriate representation of continuously varying phenotypic measurements is a controversial problem without a general solution. A common method is simply to sort the measurements of interest into two or more classes, rendering continuous observed variation as discretely classifiable (e.g., all examples with humerus bones longer than a given cutoff are scored as members of one state, and all members whose humerus bones are shorter than the cutoff are scored as members of a second state). This results in an easily manipulated [[data set]] but has been criticized for poor reporting of the basis for the class definitions and for sacrificing information compared to methods that use a continuous weighted distribution of measurements.&lt;ref name="Wiens"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiens | first1 = JJ | year = 2001 | title = Character analysis in morphological phylogenetics: problems and solutions | url = | journal = Syst Biol | volume = 50 | issue = 5| pages = 689–699 | doi=10.1080/106351501753328811| pmid = 12116939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because morphological data is extremely labor-intensive to collect, whether from literature sources or from field observations, reuse of previously compiled data matrices is not uncommon, although this may propagate flaws in the original matrix into multiple derivative analyses.&lt;ref name="Jenner"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jenner | first1 = RA | year = 2001 | title = Bilaterian phylogeny and uncritical recycling of morphological data sets | url = | journal = Syst Biol | volume = 50 | issue = 5| pages = 730–743 | doi=10.1080/106351501753328857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molecular analysis===
The problem of character coding is very different in molecular analyses, as the characters in biological sequence data are immediate and discretely defined - distinct [[nucleotide]]s in [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] sequences and distinct [[amino acid]]s in [[protein]] sequences. However, defining [[homology (biology)|homology]] can be challenging due to the inherent difficulties of [[multiple sequence alignment]]. For a given gapped MSA, several rooted phylogenetic trees can be constructed that vary in their interpretations of which changes are "[[mutation]]s" versus ancestral characters, and which events are [[insertion (genetics)|insertion mutations]] or [[deletion (genetics)|deletion mutations]]. For example, given only a pairwise alignment with a gap region, it is impossible to determine whether one sequence bears an insertion mutation or the other carries a deletion. The problem is magnified in MSAs with unaligned and nonoverlapping gaps. In practice, sizable regions of a calculated alignment may be discounted in phylogenetic tree construction to avoid integrating noisy data into the tree calculation.
&lt;!-- more here on the effects of mutation rates--&gt;

==Distance-matrix methods==
{{Main|Distance matrices in phylogeny}}
Distance-matrix methods of phylogenetic analysis explicitly rely on a measure of "genetic distance" between the sequences being classified, and therefore they require an MSA as an input. Distance is often defined as the fraction of mismatches at aligned positions, with gaps either ignored or counted as mismatches.&lt;ref name="mount" /&gt; Distance methods attempt to construct an all-to-all matrix from the sequence query set describing the distance between each sequence pair. From this is constructed a phylogenetic tree that places closely related sequences under the same [[interior node]] and whose branch lengths closely reproduce the observed distances between sequences. Distance-matrix methods may produce either rooted or unrooted trees, depending on the algorithm used to calculate them. They are frequently used as the basis for progressive and iterative types of [[multiple sequence alignment]]s. The main disadvantage of distance-matrix methods is their inability to efficiently use information about local high-variation regions that appear across multiple subtrees.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;

===UPGMA and WPGMA===
{{Main|UPGMA}}
{{Main|WPGMA}}

The [[UPGMA]] (''Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean'') and [[WPGMA]] (''Weighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean'') methods produce rooted trees and require a constant-rate assumption - that is, it assumes an [[ultrametric]] tree in which the distances from the root to every branch tip are equal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sokal R and Michener C |title=A statistical method for evaluating systematic relationships |journal=University of Kansas Science Bulletin |volume=38 |pages=1409–1438 |year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neighbor-joining===
{{Main|Neighbor joining}}

Neighbor-joining methods apply general [[cluster analysis]] techniques to sequence analysis using genetic distance as a clustering metric. The simple [[neighbor-joining]] method produces unrooted trees, but it does not assume a constant rate of evolution (i.e., a [[molecular clock]]) across lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saitou|first=N.|last2=Nei|first2=M.|date=1987-07-01|title=The neighbor-joining method: a new method for reconstructing phylogenetic trees.|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/4/406|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|language=en|volume=4|issue=4|pages=406–425|issn=0737-4038|pmid=3447015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fitch-Margoliash method===
The [[Distance matrices in phylogeny#Fitch-Margoliash method|Fitch-Margoliash method]] uses a weighted [[least squares]] method for clustering based on genetic distance.&lt;ref name="fitch"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WM | authorlink = Walter M. Fitch | authorlink2 = Emanuel Margoliash | last2 = Margoliash | first2 = E. | year = 1967 | title = Construction of phylogenetic trees | url = | journal = Science | volume = 155 | issue = 3760| pages = 279–284 | doi=10.1126/science.155.3760.279 | pmid=5334057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely related sequences are given more weight in the tree construction process to correct for the increased inaccuracy in measuring distances between distantly related sequences. The distances used as input to the algorithm must be normalized to prevent large artifacts in computing relationships between closely related and distantly related groups. The distances calculated by this method must be [[linear]]; the linearity criterion for distances requires that the [[expected value]]s of the branch lengths for two individual branches must equal the expected value of the sum of the two branch distances - a property that applies to biological sequences only when they have been corrected for the possibility of [[Mutation#By effect on function|back mutation]]s at individual sites. This correction is done through the use of a [[substitution matrix]] such as that derived from the [[Jukes-Cantor model]] of DNA evolution. The distance correction is only necessary in practice when the evolution rates differ among branches.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; Another modification of the algorithm can be helpful, especially in case of concentrated distances (please report to [[concentration of measure]] phenomenon and [[curse of dimensionality]]): that modification, described in,&lt;ref name="Lespinats"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lespinats | first1 = S. | last2 = Grando | first2 = D. | last3 = Maréchal | first3 = E. | last4 = Hakimi | first4 = M.A. | last5 = Tenaillon | first5 = O. | last6 = Bastien | first6 = O. | year = 2011 | title = How Fitch-Margoliash Algorithm can benefit from Multi Dimensional Scaling | url = | journal = [[Evolutionary Bioinformatics]] | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 61–85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been shown to improve the efficiency of the algorithm and its robustness.

The least-squares criterion applied to these distances is more accurate but less efficient than the neighbor-joining methods. An additional improvement that corrects for correlations between distances that arise from many closely related sequences in the data set can also be applied at increased computational cost. Finding the optimal least-squares tree with any correction factor is [[NP-complete]],&lt;ref name="day"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Day | first1 = William HE | year = 1987 | title = Computational complexity of inferring phylogenies from dissimilarity matrices | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092824087800071 | journal = [[Bulletin of Mathematical Biology]] | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 461–467 | doi=10.1016/s0092-8240(87)80007-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; so [[heuristic]] search methods like those used in maximum-parsimony analysis are applied to the search through tree space.

===Using outgroups===
Independent information about the relationship between sequences or groups can be used to help reduce the tree search space and root unrooted trees. Standard usage of distance-matrix methods involves the inclusion of at least one [[Outgroup (cladistics)|outgroup]] sequence known to be only distantly related to the sequences of interest in the query set.&lt;ref name="mount" /&gt; This usage can be seen as a type of [[experimental control]]. If the outgroup has been appropriately chosen, it will have a much greater [[genetic distance]] and thus a longer branch length than any other sequence, and it will appear near the root of a rooted tree. Choosing an appropriate outgroup requires the selection of a sequence that is moderately related to the sequences of interest; too close a relationship defeats the purpose of the outgroup and too distant adds [[signal noise|noise]] to the analysis.&lt;ref name="mount" /&gt; Care should also be taken to avoid situations in which the species from which the sequences were taken are distantly related, but the gene encoded by the sequences is highly [[conservation (genetics)|conserved]] across lineages. [[Horizontal gene transfer]], especially between otherwise divergent [[bacteria]], can also confound outgroup usage.

==Maximum parsimony==
[[Maximum parsimony]] (MP) is a method of identifying the potential phylogenetic tree that requires the smallest total number of [[evolution]]ary events to explain the observed sequence data. Some ways of scoring trees also include a "cost" associated with particular types of evolutionary events and attempt to locate the tree with the smallest total cost. This is a useful approach in cases where not every possible type of event is equally likely - for example, when particular [[nucleotide]]s or [[amino acid]]s are known to be more mutable than others.

The most naive way of identifying the most parsimonious tree is simple enumeration - considering each possible tree in succession and searching for the tree with the smallest score. However, this is only possible for a relatively small number of sequences or species because the problem of identifying the most parsimonious tree is known to be [[NP-hard]];&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; consequently a number of [[heuristic]] search methods for [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] have been developed to locate a highly parsimonious tree, if not the best in the set. Most such methods involve a [[steepest descent]]-style minimization mechanism operating on a [[tree rearrangement]] criterion.

===Branch and bound===
The [[branch and bound]] algorithm is a general method used to increase the efficiency of searches for near-optimal solutions of [[NP-hard]] problems first applied to phylogenetics in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="hendy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hendy | first1 = MD | last2 = Penny | first2 = D | year = 1982 | title = Branch and bound algorithms to determine minimal evolutionary trees | url = | journal = Math Biosci | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 133–142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Branch and bound is particularly well suited to phylogenetic tree construction because it inherently requires dividing a problem into a [[tree structure]] as it subdivides the problem space into smaller regions. As its name implies, it requires as input both a branching rule (in the case of phylogenetics, the addition of the next species or sequence to the tree) and a bound (a rule that excludes certain regions of the search space from consideration, thereby assuming that the optimal solution cannot occupy that region). Identifying a good bound is the most challenging aspect of the algorithm's application to phylogenetics. A simple way of defining the bound is a maximum number of assumed evolutionary changes allowed per tree. A set of criteria known as Zharkikh's rules&lt;ref name="zharkikh"&gt;Ratner VA, Zharkikh AA, Kolchanov N, Rodin S, Solovyov S, Antonov AS. (1995). ''Molecular Evolution'' Biomathematics Series Vol 24. Springer-Verlag: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; severely limit the search space by defining characteristics shared by all candidate "most parsimonious" trees. The two most basic rules require the elimination of all but one redundant sequence (for cases where multiple observations have produced identical data) and the elimination of character sites at which two or more states do not occur in at least two species. Under ideal conditions these rules and their associated algorithm would completely define a tree.

===Sankoff-Morel-Cedergren algorithm===
The Sankoff-Morel-Cedergren algorithm was among the first published methods to simultaneously produce an MSA and a phylogenetic tree for nucleotide sequences.&lt;ref name="sankoff"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sankoff | first1 = D | last2 = Morel | first2 = C | last3 = Cedergren | first3 = RJ | year = 1973 | title = Evolution of 5S RNA and the non-randomness of base replacement | url = | journal = Nature New Biology | volume = 245 | issue = 147| pages = 232–234 | doi=10.1038/newbio245232a0 | pmid=4201431}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method uses a [[maximum parsimony]] calculation in conjunction with a scoring function that penalizes gaps and mismatches, thereby favoring the tree that introduces a minimal number of such events (an alternative view holds that the trees to be favored are those that maximize the amount of sequence similarity that can be interpreted as homology, a point of view that may lead to different optimal trees &lt;ref name="de_laet2005"&gt;De Laet J. (2005). Parsimony and the problem of inapplicables in sequence data. Pp. 81-116 in Albert, V.A. (ed.) ''Parsimony, phylogeny and genomics.'' Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-856493-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The imputed sequences at the [[interior node]]s of the tree are scored and summed over all the nodes in each possible tree. The lowest-scoring tree sum provides both an optimal tree and an optimal MSA given the scoring function. Because the method is highly computationally intensive, an approximate method in which initial guesses for the interior alignments are refined one node at a time. Both the full and the approximate version are in practice calculated by dynamic programming.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;

===MALIGN and POY===
More recent phylogenetic tree/MSA methods use heuristics to isolate high-scoring, but not necessarily optimal, trees. The MALIGN method uses a maximum-parsimony technique to compute a multiple alignment by maximizing a [[cladogram]] score, and its companion POY uses an iterative method that couples the optimization of the phylogenetic tree with improvements in the corresponding MSA.&lt;ref name="wheeler"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wheeler | first1 = WC | last2 = Gladstein | first2 = DG | year = 1994 | title = MALIGN: a multiple nucleic acid sequence alignment program | url = | journal = Journal of Heredity | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 417–418 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a111492}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of these methods in constructing evolutionary hypotheses has been criticized as biased due to the deliberate construction of trees reflecting minimal evolutionary events.&lt;ref name="simmons"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simmons | first1 = MP | year = 2004 | title = Independence of alignment and tree search | url = | journal = Mol Phylogenet Evol | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 874–879 | pmid = 15120385 | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2003.10.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, has been countered by the view that such methods should be seen as heuristic approaches to find the trees that maximize the amount of sequence similarity that can be interpreted as homology.&lt;ref name="de_laet2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="de_laet2015"&gt;
{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/cla.12098 | title = Parsimony analysis of unaligned sequence data: maximization of homology and minimization of homoplasy, not Minimization of operationally defined total cost or minimization of equally weighted transformations | year = 2015 | author = De Laet, Jan | journal = Cladistics | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 550 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maximum likelihood==
The [[maximum likelihood]] method uses standard statistical techniques for inferring [[probability distribution]]s to assign probabilities to particular possible phylogenetic trees. The method requires a [[substitution model]] to assess the probability of particular [[mutation]]s; roughly, a tree that requires more mutations at interior nodes to explain the observed phylogeny will be assessed as having a lower probability. This is broadly similar to the maximum-parsimony method, but maximum likelihood allows additional statistical flexibility by permitting varying rates of evolution across both lineages and sites. In fact, the method requires that evolution at different sites and along different lineages must be [[statistically independent]]. Maximum likelihood is thus well suited to the analysis of distantly related sequences, but it is believed to be computationally intractable to compute due to its NP-hardness.&lt;ref name="chor"&gt;Chor B, Tuller T. (2005). Maximum likelihood of evolutionary trees: hardness and approximation. ''Bioinformatics'' 21.suppl 1:  i97-i106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "pruning" algorithm, a variant of [[dynamic programming]], is often used to reduce the search space by efficiently calculating the likelihood of subtrees.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; The method calculates the likelihood for each site in a "linear" manner, starting at a node whose only descendants are leaves (that is, the tips of the tree) and working backwards toward the "bottom" node in nested sets. However, the trees produced by the method are only rooted if the substitution model is irreversible, which is not generally true of biological systems. The search for the maximum-likelihood tree also includes a branch length optimization component that is difficult to improve upon algorithmically; general [[global optimization]] tools such as the [[Newton-Raphson]] method are often used.

==Bayesian inference==&lt;!--There is at least one wikilink here, so fix if you change the section title--&gt;
{{Main|Bayesian inference in phylogeny}}
[[Bayesian inference]] can be used to produce phylogenetic trees in a manner closely related to the maximum likelihood methods. Bayesian methods assume a prior [[probability distribution]] of the possible trees, which may simply be the probability of any one tree among all the possible trees that could be generated from the data, or may be a more sophisticated estimate derived from the assumption that divergence events such as [[speciation]] occur as [[stochastic process]]es. The choice of prior distribution is a point of contention among users of Bayesian-inference phylogenetics methods.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;

Implementations of Bayesian methods generally use [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] sampling algorithms, although the choice of move set varies; selections used in Bayesian phylogenetics include circularly permuting leaf nodes of a proposed tree at each step&lt;ref name="Mau"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mau | first1 = B | last2 = Newton | first2 = MA | year = 1997 | title = Phylogenetic inference for binary data on dendrograms using Markov chain Monte Carlo | url = | journal = J Comp Graph Stat | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 122–131 | doi=10.2307/1390728| jstor = 1390728 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and swapping descendant subtrees of a random [[internal node]] between two related trees.&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yang | first1 = Z | last2 = Rannala | first2 = B | year = 1997 | title = bayesian phylogenetic inference using DNA sequences: a Markov chain Monte Carlo method | url = | journal = Mol Biol Evol | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 717–724 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025811 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Bayesian methods in phylogenetics has been controversial, largely due to incomplete specification of the choice of move set, acceptance criterion, and prior distribution in published work.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;  Bayesian methods are generally held to be superior to parsimony-based methods; they can be more prone to long-branch attraction than maximum likelihood techniques,&lt;ref name="Kolaczkowski2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kolaczkowski | first1 = B. | last2 = Thornton | first2 = J.

Whereas likelihood methods find the tree that maximizes the probability of the data, a Bayesian approach recovers a tree that represents the most likely clades, by drawing on the posterior distribution.  However, estimates of the posterior probability of clades (measuring their 'support') can be quite wide of the mark, especially in clades that aren't overwhelmingly likely. As such, other methods have been put forwards to estimate posterior probability.&lt;ref name="Larget2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Larget | first1 = B. | title = The Estimation of Tree Posterior Probabilities Using Conditional Clade Probability Distributions | doi = 10.1093/sysbio/syt014 | journal = Systematic Biology | volume = 62 | issue = 4 | pages = 501–511 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23479066| pmc =3676676 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model selection==
Molecular phylogenetics methods rely on a defined [[substitution model]] that encodes a hypothesis about the relative rates of [[mutation]] at various sites along the gene or amino acid sequences being studied. At their simplest, substitution models aim to correct for differences in the rates of [[transition (genetics)|transitions]] and [[transversion]]s in nucleotide sequences. The use of substitution models is necessitated by the fact that the [[genetic distance]] between two sequences increases linearly only for a short time after the two sequences diverge from each other (alternatively, the distance is linear only shortly before [[coalescent theory|coalescence]]). The longer the amount of time after divergence, the more likely it becomes that two mutations occur at the same nucleotide site. Simple genetic distance calculations will thus undercount the number of mutation events that have occurred in evolutionary history. The extent of this undercount increases with increasing time since divergence, which can lead to the phenomenon of [[long branch attraction]], or the misassignment of two distantly related but convergently evolving sequences as closely related.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152633 | title = Model Selection in Phylogenetics | year = 2005 | author = Sullivan, Jack | journal = Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 445–466 | last2 = Joyce | first2 = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum parsimony method is particularly susceptible to this problem due to its explicit search for a tree representing a minimum number of distinct evolutionary events.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;

===Types of models===
{{Main|Substitution model}}

All substitution models assign a set of weights to each possible change of state represented in the sequence. The most common model types are implicitly reversible because they assign the same weight to, for example, a G&gt;C nucleotide mutation as to a C&gt;G mutation. The simplest possible model, the [[Jukes-Cantor model]], assigns an equal probability to every possible change of state for a given nucleotide base. The rate of change between any two distinct nucleotides will be one-third of the overall substitution rate.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; More advanced models distinguish between [[transition (genetics)|transitions]] and [[transversion]]s. The most general possible time-reversible model, called the GTR model, has six mutation rate parameters. An even more generalized model known as the general 12-parameter model breaks time-reversibility, at the cost of much additional complexity in calculating genetic distances that are consistent among multiple lineages.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; One possible variation on this theme adjusts the rates so that overall GC content - an important measure of DNA double helix stability - varies over time.&lt;ref name="Galtier"&gt;Galtier N, Guoy M. (1998.) Inferring pattern and process: maximum-likelihood implementation of a nonhomogeneous model of DNA sequence evolution for phylogenetic analysis. ''Mol. Biol. Evol.'' 15:871–879.&lt;/ref&gt;

Models may also allow for the variation of rates with positions in the input sequence. The most obvious example of such variation follows from the arrangement of nucleotides in protein-coding genes into three-base [[codon]]s. If the location of the [[open reading frame]] (ORF) is known, rates of mutation can be adjusted for position of a given site within a codon, since it is known that [[wobble base pair]]ing can allow for higher mutation rates in the third nucleotide of a given codon without affecting the codon's meaning in the [[genetic code]].&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; A less hypothesis-driven example that does not rely on ORF identification simply assigns to each site a rate randomly drawn from a predetermined distribution, often the [[gamma distribution]] or [[log-normal distribution]].&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; Finally, a more conservative estimate of rate variations known as the [[covarion]] method allows [[autocorrelation|autocorrelated]] variations in rates, so that the mutation rate of a given site is correlated across sites and lineages.&lt;ref name="FitchMarkowitz"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WM | last2 = Markowitz | first2 = E | year = 1970 | title = An improved method for determining codon variability in a gene and its application to the rate of fixation of mutations in evolution | url = | journal = Biochemical Genetics | volume = 4 | issue = 5| pages = 579–593 | doi=10.1007/bf00486096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choosing the best model===
The selection of an appropriate model is critical for the production of good phylogenetic analyses, both because underparameterized or overly restrictive models may produce aberrant behavior when their underlying assumptions are violated, and because overly complex or overparameterized models are computationally expensive and the parameters may be overfit.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; The most common method of model selection is the [[likelihood ratio test]] (LRT), which produces a likelihood estimate that can be interpreted as a measure of "[[goodness of fit]]" between the model and the input data.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; However, care must be taken in using these results, since a more complex model with more parameters will always have a higher likelihood than a simplified version of the same model, which can lead to the naive selection of models that are overly complex.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;  For this reason model selection computer programs will choose the simplest model that is not significantly worse than more complex substitution models. A significant disadvantage of the LRT is the necessity of making a series of pairwise comparisons between models; it has been shown that the order in which the models are compared has a major effect on the one that is eventually selected.&lt;ref name="Pol"&gt;Pol D. (2004.) Empirical problems of the hierarchical likelihood ratio test for model selection. ''Syst Biol'' 53:949–962.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative model selection method is the [[Akaike information criterion]] (AIC), formally an estimate of the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] between the true model and the model being tested. It can be interpreted as a likelihood estimate with a correction factor to penalize overparameterized models.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; The AIC is calculated on an individual model rather than a pair, so it is independent of the order in which models are assessed. A related alternative, the [[Bayesian information criterion]] (BIC), has a similar basic interpretation but penalizes complex models more heavily.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

A comprehensive step-by-step protocol on constructing phylogenetic tree, including DNA/Amino Acid contiguous sequence assembly, multiple sequence alignment, model-test (testing best-fitting substitution models) and phylogeny reconstruction using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference, is available at ''Nature Protocol''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/protex.2013.065 | title=Sequence similarity search, Multiple Sequence Alignment, Model Selection, Distance Matrix and Phylogeny Reconstruction | year=2013 | journal=Protocol Exchange | last1 = Bast | first1 = Felix }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A non traditional way of evaluating the phylogenetic tree is to compare it with clustering result. One can use a Multidimensional Scaling technique, so called Interpolative Joining to do dimensionality reduction to visualize the clustering result for the sequences in 3D, and then map the phylogenetic tree onto the clustering result. A better tree usually has a higher correlation with the clustering result.&lt;ref&gt;Ruan, Yang, et al. "Integration of Clustering and Multidimensional Scaling to Determine Phylogenetic Trees as Spherical Phylograms Visualized in 3 Dimensions." Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGrid), 2014 14th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on. IEEE, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluating tree support==
As with all statistical analysis, the estimation of phylogenies from character data requires an evaluation of confidence. A number of methods exist to test the amount of support for a phylogenetic tree, either by evaluating the support for each sub-tree in the phylogeny (nodal support) or evaluating whether the phylogeny is significantly different from other possible trees (alternative tree hypothesis tests).

===Nodal support===
The most common method for assessing tree support is to evaluate the statistical support for each node on the tree. Typically, a node with very low support is not considered valid in further analysis, and visually may be collapsed into a [[polytomy]] to indicate that relationships within a clade are unresolved.

====Consensus tree====
Many methods for assessing nodal support involve consideration of multiple phylogenies. The consensus tree summarizes the nodes that are shared among a set of trees.&lt;ref name="BaumSmith2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David A. Baum|author2=Stacey D. Smith|title=Tree Thinking: An Introduction to Phylogenetic Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zW_ApwAACAAJ|year=2013|publisher=Roberts|isbn=978-1-936221-16-5|page=442}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a *strict consensus,* only nodes found in every tree are shown, and the rest are collapsed into an unresolved [[polytomy]]. Less conservative methods, such as the *majority-rule consensus* tree, consider nodes that are supported by a given percentage of trees under consideration (such as at least 50%).

For example, in maximum parsimony analysis, there may be many trees with the same parsimony score. A strict consensus tree would show which nodes are found in all equally parsimonious trees, and which nodes differ. Consensus trees are also used to evaluate support on phylogenies reconstructed with Bayesian inference (see below).

====Bootstrapping and jackknifing====
In statistics, the [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]] is a method for inferring the variability of data that has an unknown distribution using pseudoreplications of the original data. For example, given a set of 100 data points, a [[pseudoreplicate]] is a data set of the same size (100 points) randomly sampled from the original data, with replacement. That is, each original data point may be represented more than once in the pseudoreplicate, or not at all. Statistical support involves evaluation of whether the original data has similar properties to a large set of pseudoreplicates.

In phylogenetics, bootstrapping is conducted using the columns of the character matrix. Each pseudoreplicate contains the same number of species (rows) and characters (columns) randomly sampled from the original matrix, with replacement. A phylogeny is reconstructed from each pseudoreplicate, with the same methods used to reconstruct the phylogeny from the original data. For each node on the phylogeny, the nodal support is the percentage of pseudoreplicates containing that node.&lt;ref name="Felsenstein1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Felsenstein|first1=Joseph|title=Confidence Limits on Phylogenies: An Approach Using the Bootstrap|journal=Evolution|volume=39|issue=4|year=1985|pages=783–791|issn=0014-3820|doi=10.2307/2408678|pmid=28561359|jstor=2408678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statistical rigor of the bootstrap test has been empirically evaluated using viral populations with known evolutionary histories,&lt;ref name="HillisBull1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hillis|first1=D. M.|last2=Bull|first2=J. J.|title=An Empirical Test of Bootstrapping as a Method for Assessing Confidence in Phylogenetic Analysis|journal=Systematic Biology|volume=42|issue=2|year=1993|pages=182–192|issn=1063-5157|doi=10.1093/sysbio/42.2.182}}&lt;/ref&gt; finding that 70% bootstrap support corresponds to a 95% probability that the clade exists. However, this was tested under ideal conditions (e.g. no change in evolutionary rates, symmetric phylogenies). In practice, values above 70% are generally supported and left to the researcher or reader to evaluate confidence. Nodes with support lower than 70% are typically considered unresolved.

Jackknifing in phylogenetics is a similar procedure, except the columns of the matrix are sampled without replacement. Pseudoreplicates are generated by randomly subsampling the data—for example, a "10% jackknife" would involve randomly sampling 10% of the matrix many times to evaluate nodal support.

==== Posterior probability ====
Reconstruction of phylogenies using [[Bayesian inference]] generates a posterior distribution of highly probable trees given the data and evolutionary model, rather than a single "best" tree. The trees in the posterior distribution generally have many different topologies. Most Bayesian inference methods utilize a Markov-chain Monte Carlo iteration, and the initial steps of this chain are not considered reliable reconstructions of the phylogeny. Trees generated early in the chain are usually discarded as [[burn-in]]. The most common method of evaluating nodal support in a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis is to calculate the percentage of trees in the posterior distribution (post-burn-in) which contain the node.

The statistical support for a node in Bayesian inference is expected to reflect the probability that a clade really exists given the data and evolutionary model.&lt;ref name="HuelsenbeckRannala2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huelsenbeck|first1=John|last2=Rannala|first2=Bruce|title=Frequentist Properties of Bayesian Posterior Probabilities of Phylogenetic Trees Under Simple and Complex Substitution Models|journal=Systematic Biology|volume=53|issue=6|year=2004|pages=904–913|issn=1063-5157|doi=10.1080/10635150490522629|pmid=15764559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the threshold for accepting a node as supported is generally higher than for bootstrapping.

==== Step counting methods====
[[Bremer support]] counts the number of extra steps needed to contradict a clade.

===Shortcomings ===
These measures each have their weaknesses. For example, smaller or larger clades tend to attract larger support values than mid-sized clades, simply as a result of the number of taxa in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/jzs.12024| title = Evaluating the clade size effect in alternative measures of branch support| journal = Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research| pages = n/a| year = 2013| last1 = Chemisquy | first1 = M. A. A. | last2 = Prevosti | first2 = F. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bootstrap support can provide high estimates of node support as a result of noise in the data rather than the true existence of a clade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msh137| pmid = 15084674| title = Genome-Scale Phylogeny and the Detection of Systematic Biases| journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution| volume = 21| issue = 7| pages = 1455–1458| year = 2004| last1 = Phillips | first1 = M. J.| last2 = Delsuc| first2 = F| last3 = Penny| first3 = D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations and workarounds ==
Ultimately, there is no way to measure whether a particular phylogenetic hypothesis is accurate or not, unless the true relationships among the taxa being examined are already known (which may happen with bacteria or viruses under laboratory conditions). The best result an empirical phylogeneticist can hope to attain is a tree with branches that are well supported by the available evidence. Several potential pitfalls have been identified:

=== Homoplasy ===
{{main|Convergent evolution}}
Certain characters are more likely to [[Convergent evolution|evolve convergently]] than others; logically, such characters should be given less weight in the reconstruction of a tree.&lt;ref name=Goloboff2008&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2008.00209.x |title=Weighting against homoplasy improves phylogenetic analysis of morphological data sets |year=2008 |last1=Goloboff |first1=Pablo A. |last2=Carpenter |first2=James M. |last3=Arias |first3=J. Salvador |last4=Esquivel |first4=Daniel Rafael Miranda |journal=Cladistics |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=758–773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weights in the form of a model of evolution can be inferred from sets of molecular data, so that [[maximum likelihood]] or [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] methods can be used to analyze them. For molecular sequences, this problem is exacerbated when the taxa under study have diverged substantially. As time since the divergence of two taxa increase, so does the probability of multiple substitutions on the same site, or back mutations, all of which result in homoplasies.  For morphological data, unfortunately, the only objective way to determine convergence is by the construction of a tree&amp;nbsp;– a somewhat circular method. Even so, weighting homoplasious characters{{how|date=September 2012}} does indeed lead to better-supported trees.&lt;ref name=Goloboff2008/&gt; Further refinement can be brought by weighting changes in one direction higher than changes in another; for instance, the presence of thoracic wings almost guarantees placement among the pterygote insects because, although wings are often lost secondarily, there is no evidence that they have been gained more than once.&lt;ref name=Goloboff1997&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.1997.tb00317.x |title=Self-Weighted Optimization: Tree Searches and Character State Reconstructions under Implied Transformation Costs |year=1997 |last1=Goloboff |first1=Pablo A. |journal=Cladistics |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=225–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Horizontal gene transfer ===
In general, organisms can inherit genes in two ways: vertical gene transfer and [[horizontal gene transfer]]. Vertical gene transfer is the passage of genes from parent to offspring, and horizontal (also called lateral) gene transfer occurs when genes jump between unrelated organisms, a common phenomenon especially in [[prokaryote]]s; a good example of this is the acquired [[antibiotic resistance]] as a result of gene exchange between various bacteria leading to multi-drug-resistant bacterial species. There have also been well-documented cases of horizontal gene transfer [[Horizontal gene transfer#Eukaryotes|between eukaryotes]].

Horizontal gene transfer has complicated the determination of phylogenies of organisms, and inconsistencies in phylogeny have been reported among specific groups of organisms depending on the genes used to construct evolutionary trees. The only way to determine which genes have been acquired vertically and which horizontally is to [[Occam's razor|parsimoniously]] assume that the largest set of genes that have been inherited together have been inherited vertically; this requires analyzing a large number of genes.

=== Hybrids, speciation, introgressions and incomplete  lineage sorting===
The basic assumption underlying the mathematical model of cladistics is a situation where species split neatly in bifurcating fashion. While such an assumption may hold on a larger scale (bar horizontal gene transfer, see above), [[speciation]] is often much less orderly. Research since the cladistic method was introduced has shown that [[hybrid speciation]], once thought rare, is in fact quite common, particularly in plants.&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=M.L.|title=Natural Hybridization and Evolution|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-509975-1|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendel, J F. &amp; Doyle, J.J. (1998): DNA Sequencing. In ''Molecular Systematics of Plants II''. Editors: D.E. Soltis, [[P.S. Soltis]], J.J. Doyle. Kluwer, Boston, pp. 265–296.&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[paraspecies|paraphyletic speciation]] is common, making the assumption of a bifurcating pattern unsuitable, leading to [[phylogenetic network]]s rather than trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Funk | first1 = D.

Our current knowledge of processes such as hybridization, endosymbiosis and lateral gene transfer makes clear that the evolutionary history of life on Earth cannot accurately be depicted as a single, typological, bifurcating tree.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Introgression]] can also move genes between otherwise distinct species and sometimes even genera, complicating phylogenetic analysis based on genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Qu|first1=Yanhua|last2=Zhang|first2=Ruiying|last3=Quan|first3=Qing|last4=Song|first4=Gang|last5=Li|first5=Shou Hsien|last6=Lei|first6=Fumin|title=Incomplete lineage sorting or secondary admixture: disentangling historical divergence from recent gene flow in the Vinous-throated parrotbill (''Paradoxornis webbianus'')|journal=Molecular Ecology|date=December 2012|volume=21|issue=24|pages=6117–6133|doi=10.1111/mec.12080|pmid=23095021}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 May 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon can contribute to "incomplete lineage sorting" and is thought to be a common phenomenon across a number of groups. In species level analysis this can be dealt with by larger sampling or better whole genome analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollard|first1=Daniel A.|last2=Iyer|first2=Venky N.|last3=Moses|first3=Alan M.|last4=Eisen|first4=Michael B.|title=Widespread Discordance of Gene Trees with Species Tree in Drosophila: Evidence for Incomplete Lineage Sorting|journal=PLoS Genetics|date=2006|volume=2|issue=10|pages=e173|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020173|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020173|pmid=17132051|pmc=1626107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the problem is avoided by restricting the analysis to fewer, not closely related specimens.

=== Taxon sampling ===
Owing to the development of advanced sequencing techniques in [[molecular biology]], it has become feasible to gather large amounts of data (DNA or amino acid sequences) to infer phylogenetic hypotheses. For example, it is not rare to find studies with character matrices based on whole [[mitochondrial]] genomes (~16,000 nucleotides, in many animals). However, simulations have shown that it is more important to increase the number of taxa in the matrix than to increase the number of characters, because the more taxa there are, the more accurate and more robust is the resulting phylogenetic tree.&lt;ref name="Zwickl2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10635150290102339 |title=Increased Taxon Sampling Greatly Reduces Phylogenetic Error |year=2002 |last1=Zwickl |first1=Derrick J. |last2=Hillis |first2=David M. |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=588–598 |pmid=12228001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiens2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2005.04.001 |title=Missing data and the design of phylogenetic analyses |year=2006 |last1=Wiens |first1=John J. |journal=Journal of Biomedical Informatics |volume=39 |pages=34–42 |pmid=15922672 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be partly due to the breaking up of [[long branch attraction|long branches]].

=== Phylogenetic signal ===
Another important factor that affects the accuracy of tree reconstruction is whether the data analyzed actually contain a useful phylogenetic signal, a term that is used generally to denote whether a character evolves slowly enough to have the same state in closely related taxa as opposed to varying randomly. Tests for phylogenetic signal exist.&lt;ref name="Blomberg2003"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12778543 |year=2003 |last1=Blomberg |first1=Simon P. |last2=Garland Jr |first2=Theodore |last3=Ives |first3=Anthony R. |title=Testing for phylogenetic signal in comparative data: Behavioral traits are more labile |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=717–745 |journal=Evolution |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00285.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continuous characters ===
Morphological characters that sample a continuum may contain phylogenetic signal, but are hard to code as discrete characters. Several methods have been used, one of which is gap coding, and there are variations on gap coding.&lt;ref name=Archie1985&gt;{{cite journal|author=Archie, J.W.|year=1985|title=Methods for coding variable morphological features for numerical taxonomic analysis|journal=Systematic Zoology|volume=34|issue=3|pages=326–345|url=http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/3/326.abstract|doi=10.2307/2413151|jstor=2413151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original form of gap coding:&lt;ref name=Archie1985/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;group means for a character are first ordered by size. The pooled within-group standard deviation is calculated ... and differences between adjacent means ... are compared relative to this standard deviation. Any pair of adjacent means is considered different and given different integer scores ... if the means are separated by a "gap" greater than the within-group standard deviation ... times some arbitrary constant.&lt;/blockquote&gt; If more taxa are added to the analysis, the gaps between taxa may become so small that all information is lost. Generalized gap coding works around that problem by comparing individual pairs of taxa rather than considering one set that contains all of the taxa.&lt;ref name=Archie1985/&gt;

=== Missing data ===
In general, the more data that are available when constructing a tree, the more accurate and reliable the resulting tree will be. Missing data are no more detrimental than simply having fewer data, although the impact is greatest when most of the missing data are in a small number of taxa. Concentrating the missing data across a small number of characters produces a more robust tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Prevosti |first1=Francisco J. |last2=Chemisquy |first2=María A. |doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2009.00289.x |title=The impact of missing data on real morphological phylogenies: Influence of the number and distribution of missing entries |year=2009 |journal=Cladistics |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=326–339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The role of fossils ==
Because many characters involve embryological, or soft-tissue or molecular characters that (at best) hardly ever fossilize, and the interpretation of fossils is more ambiguous than that of [[Extant taxon|living taxa]], extinct taxa almost invariably have higher proportions of missing data than living ones. However, despite these limitations, the inclusion of fossils is invaluable, as they can provide information in sparse areas of trees, breaking up long branches and constraining intermediate character states; thus, fossil taxa contribute as much to tree resolution as modern taxa.&lt;ref name=Cobbett2007&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10635150701627296 |title=Fossils Impact as Hard as Living Taxa in Parsimony Analyses of Morphology |year=2007 |last1=Cobbett |first1=Andrea |last2=Wilkinson |first2=Mark |last3=Wills |first3=Matthew |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=753–766 |pmid=17886145}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Fossils can also constrain the age of lineages and thus demonstrate how consistent a tree is with the stratigraphic record;&lt;ref name="Huelsenbeck"&gt;
{{cite journal |first1=John P. |last1=Huelsenbeck |year=1994 |title=Comparing the Stratigraphic Record to Estimates of Phylogeny |journal=Paleobiology |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=470–483 |jstor=2401230 |doi=10.1017/s009483730001294x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[stratocladistics]] incorporates age information into data matrices for phylogenetic analyses.

'''Content Threat Removal''' ('''CTR''') is a [[computer security|cyber security]] technology that defeats the threat posed by handling digital content in cyber space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Simon|last1=Wiseman|date=September 2017|publisher=Elsevier|journal=Computer Fraud and Security|title=Content security through transformation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other defences, including [[anti-virus|antivirus software]] and [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandboxed execution]], it does not rely on being able to detect threats. Similarly to [[Content Disarm &amp; Reconstruction|Content Disarm and Reconstruction]], CTR removes the threat without knowing whether it has done so, and acts without knowing if data contains a threat or not.

Detection strategies work by detecting unsafe content, and then blocking or removing that content. Content that is deemed safe is delivered to its destination. In contrast, Content Threat Removal assumes all data is hostile and delivers none of it to the destination, regardless of whether it is actually hostile. Although no data is delivered, the business information carried by the data is delivered, but using new data created for the purpose.

== Threat ==
Advanced attacks continuously defeat defences that are based on detection. These are often referred to as [[Zero-day (computing)|zero day]] attacks, because as soon as they are discovered attack detection mechanisms must be updated to identify and neutralise the attack, and until they are, all systems are unprotected. These attacks succeed because attackers are skilled in finding new ways of [[Evasion (network security)|evading detection]]. [[Polymorphic code]] can be used to evade the detection of known unsafe data and sandbox detection allows attacks to evade dynamic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/forensics/detecting-malware-sandbox-evasion-techniques-36667|title=Detecting Malware and Sandbox Evasion Techniques|first1=Dilshan|last1=Keragala|date=January 2016|publisher=SANS Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

A Content Threat Removal defence works by intercepting data on its way to its destination. The business information carried by the data is extracted and the data is discarded. Then entirely new, clean and safe data is built to carry the information to its destination.

The effect of building new data to carry the business information is that any unsafe elements of the original data are left behind and discarded. This includes executable data, macros, scripts and malformed data that triggers vulnerabilities in applications.

While CTR is a form of content transformation, not all transformations provide a complete defence against the content threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Simon|last1=Wiseman|title= Content Security through Transformation – Problem Statement|date=May 2017|doi=10.13140/RG.2.2.13179.92969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applicability ==

CTR is applicable to user-to-user traffic, such as email and chat, and machine-to-machine traffic, such as web services. Data transfers can be intercepted by in-line application layer proxies and these can transform the way information content is delivered to remove any threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |invent1=Graham Wyatt|invent2=Timothy Dean|title= Threat mitigation in computer networks|pridate=March 2004|number=EP1721234A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CTR works by extracting business information from data and it is not possible to extract information from executable code. This means CTR is not directly applicable to web browsing, since most web pages are code. It can, however, be applied to content that is downloaded from, and uploaded to, web sites.

Although most web pages cannot be transformed to render them safe, web browsing can be isolated and the remote access protocols used to reach the isolated environment can be subjected to CTR.

CTR provides a solution to the problem of [[Stegware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Simon|last1=Wiseman|title= Stegware – Using Steganography for Malicious Purposes |date=December 2017|doi=10.13140/RG.2.2.15283.53289}}&lt;/ref&gt; It naturally removes detectable steganography and eliminates symbiotic and permutation steganography through normalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Simon|last1=Wiseman|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319943090_Defenders_Guide_to_Steganography|title=Defenders Guide to Steganography|date=September 2017|doi=10.13140/RG.2.2.21608.98561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Availability ==

[[Deep-Secure|Deep Secure]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.deep-secure.com/content-threat-removal-video/|title=Content Threat Removal video}}&lt;/ref&gt; have pioneered the development of CTR.  A number of their products and services incorporate CTR, including [[Proxy server|application layer proxies]] for email and web services and ICAP (the [[Internet Content Adaptation Protocol]]) sidecar servers for uploaded and downloaded content.

Garrison provide a remote Desktop isolation solution where the display content is converted to a video signal that is then recoded as a video stream, using separate hardware chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.garrison.com/technology.php|title= Silicon Assured Video Isolation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process removes any threat from the content of the display content.

'''''De Prospectiva pingendi''''' (On the Perspective of painting) is the earliest and only pre–1500 Renaissance treatise solely devoted to the subject of perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andersen|first=Kirsti|title=The Geometry of Art|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-387-25961-1|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written by the Italian master [[Piero della Francesca]] late in his career but possibly by c. 1474.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kemp|first=Martin|title=The Science of Art|date=1990|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=0-300-05241-3|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Livio|first=Mario|authorlink=Mario Livio|title=The Golden Ratio|publisher=[[Random House|Broadway Books]]|location=New York|year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUARfgWRH14C&amp;pg=PA126|isbn=0-7679-0816-3|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its Latin title, the opus is written in Italian.

==The book==
The subjects covered by Piero della Francesca in these writings include [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]] and innovative work in both [[solid geometry]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]].&lt;ref name=D&gt;[http://www.codicesillustres.com/catalogue/de_prospectiva_pingendi/], Codices Illustres&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=E/&gt;

The script consists of three parts:

* Part One ''Disegno'', describing techniques for painting faces
* Part Two ''Commensurazio'', describing perspectives
* Part Three ''Coloro'', describing techniques for creating perspectives by using colours

==History==
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

''De Prospectiva Pingendi'' was probably created in the years between 1474 until 1482.&lt;ref name=B&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit13/unit13.html#Francesca], Dartmouth College&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=A&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428630/On-Perspective-in-Painting], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=E/&gt;

The writings were inspired by the book ''[[De pictura]]'' by [[Leon Battista Alberti]]&lt;ref name=A/&gt; written in 1435&lt;ref name=B/&gt; but probably also by works by [[Euclid]].&lt;ref name=E&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emsh.calarts.edu/alumni/bkeresey/pier.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329120658/http://emsh.calarts.edu/alumni/bkeresey/pier.html |archivedate=2010-03-29 |df= }}, Computer Animation Lab&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript later came into the possession of the [[Biblioteca Palatina]] in [[Parma]]&lt;ref name=E/&gt; before it was transferred to the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]].

Much of Piero’s work was later absorbed into the writing of others, notably [[Luca Pacioli]]. Piero’s work on solid geometry appears in Pacioli’s ''[[De divina proportione]]'', a work illustrated by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

In 1899 the writings were first published in bookform.&lt;ref name=C&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bnh3FKIKT9AC&amp;pg=PA606&amp;lpg=PA606&amp;dq=De+prospectiva+pingendi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=44K40GH0dO&amp;sig=TW1qcfzitd7mGdpO-mIdCIl3FAw&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=l4DBS43YHOGkOKGZ5JYE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=De%20prospectiva%20pingendi&amp;f=false], Google Books.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental''', '''ecological''' or '''green gentrification''' is a process in which cleaning up pollution or providing green amenities increases local property values and attracts wealthier residents to a previously polluted or disenfranchised neighbourhood.&lt;ref name="Banzhaf&amp;McCormick"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banzhaf |first1=H. Spencer |last2=McCormick |first2=Eleanor |title=Moving beyond cleanup: Identifying the crucibles of environmental gentrification |journal=NCEE Working Paper Series |date=2006 |url=https://www.epa.gov/environmental-economics/working-paper-moving-beyond-cleanup-identifying-crucibles-environmental}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dooling|first=Sarah|date=2009|title=Ecological gentrification: A research agenda exploring justice in the city|url=|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|volume=|pages=621–639|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green amenities include green spaces, [[park]]s [[green roof]]s, [[garden]]s and [[Green building|green and energy efficient building materials]].  These initiatives can heal many environmental ills from industrialization and beautify urban landscapes.  Additionally, greening is imperative for reaching a sustainable future.  However, if accompanied by gentrification, such initiatives can have an ambiguous social impact if the poor (especially renters) are displaced or forced to pay higher housing costs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; First coined by Sieg et al. (2004)&lt;ref name="Sieg_etal"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sieg |first1=Holger |last2=Smith |first2=V. Kerry |last3=Banzhaf |first3=H. Spencer |last4=Walsh |first4=Randall |title=Estimating the general equilibrium benefits of large changes in spatially delineated public goods |journal=International Economic Review |date=2004 |volume=45 |issue=4 |page=1047–77 |doi=10.1111/j.0020-6598.2004.00297.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.462.768 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, environmental gentrification is a relatively new concept, although it can be considered as a new hybrid of the older and wider topics of gentrification and environmental justice.  Various studies have analyzed the social implications of greening projects specifically with regards to housing affordability and displacement of vulnerable citizens.

== Gentrification ==

[[Gentrification]] is a process whereby a neighbourhoods is transformed in order to cater to a wealthier home buyer or investor.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gentrification|last=Lees|first=Loretta|last2=Slater|first2=Tom|last3=Wyly|first3=Evlin K.|publisher=Routledge/Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=2008|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The process often takes place in [[Working class|working-class]] neighbourhoods that are inhabited by low-income residents.  [[Real estate development|Real-estate development]] such as luxury condominiums or the transformation of old factories into trendy lofts, attract wealthier investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=London: aspects of change|author=Ruth Glass|year=1964|publisher=London: MacGibbon &amp; Kee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Loft Living|last=Zukin|first=Sharon|publisher=Rutgers UP|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the process progresses, low-income residents are pushed out or to the outskirts of the neighbourhood as real-estate and rent prices are increased due to demand.  Also, as middle-class residents enter the neighbourhood surrounding businesses transform to accommodate desires.  [[Gentrification]] has often been promoted by local governments through policies that promote ‘[[urban renewal|'urban renewal.']]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Generally, the process is considered to benefit the local economy and improve neighbourhoods.  Three phases of [[gentrification]] are generally recognized:
# 1960's-1970s - an irregular process led by the government which hoped to reinvest capital to the inner-city.  
# 1970s - widespread in big cities and spreading to smaller towns across North America.  Promotion of art communities such as Soho Manhattan to attract residents and investors.
# 1990s - extensive large-scale development increased in scale and complexity through public-private partnerships.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hackworth|first=Jason|last2=Smith|first2=Neil|date=2001|title=The changing state of gentrification|url=|journal=Tijdschrift voor Economische en Sociale|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As wealthier citizens have started to demand green amenities, cities have shifted their focus to marrying urban redevelopment with green initiatives all of which follow a similar process.

== Urban planning and sustainability ==

Cities and individuals are responding the [[ecological crisis]] through [[Environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] planning and actions.  Currently, the [[United Nations]] estimates that approximately 54% of the world's inhabitants are living in cities.  This number is expected to increase to 66% by the year 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nations|first=United|date=2014|title=World urbanization prospects:  the 2014 revision, highlights|url=|journal=Population Division United Nations|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many ways, the city functions like a metabolic organism, extracting, using and disposing of resources across space and time.  Therefore, studying the urban environment can often reveal spatial positions of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heynen|first=Nik|last2=Kaika|first2=Maria|last3=Swyngedouw|first3=Eric|date=|title=Urban political ecology|url=|journal=Urban Political Ecology and the Politics of Urban Metabolism|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in the United States there is a negative correlation between the provision of urban green space and [[African Americans|African-American]] and [[Hispanic]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wen|first=Ming|date=2013|title=Spatial disparities in the distribution of parks and green spaces in the USA|url=|journal=Annals of Behavioral Medicine|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spaces that are provided tend to have a lack in municipal upkeep and policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownlow|first=Alec|date=2006|title=Inherited fragmentations and narratives of environmental control and entrepreneurial Philadelphia|url=|journal=In the Nature of Cities:  Urban Political Ecology and the Politics of Urban Metabolism|volume=|pages=208–225|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, green space in affluent neighbourhoods tend to promote activities for [[wealth]]y citizens which help to maintain a certain social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dooling|first=Sarah|date=2008|title=Ecological gentrification:  re-negotiating justice in the city|url=|journal=Critical Planing|volume=15|pages=40–57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sustainability]] is a tool that has been used by governments and developers to promote green initiatives in cities.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quastel|first=Noah|date=2009|title=Political ecologies of gentrifiction|url=|journal=Urban Geography|volume=7|pages=694–725|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Growing out of the promotion of [[sustainable development]] for [[Developing country|developing countries]], [[sustainability]] emerged as a global proposal at the [[Earth Summit|1992 United Nations Earth Summit]].  In theory, [[sustainability]] is achievable through a balance of three pillars - [[economy]], [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[social equity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=W. M.|date=2009|title=The future of sustainability: re-thinking environment and development in the twenty-first century|url=|journal=Report for the IUCN Renowned Thinkings Meeting|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in practice it still remains a challenge.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Green gentrification:  urban sustainability and the struggle for environmental justice|last=Gould|first=Kenneth A.|last2=Lewis|first2=Tammy L.|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The social equity portion of sustainability is concerned with providing local communities ability to participate in [[decision-making]] as well as benefit from development projects.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; [[Public participation]] aims to ensure that local concerns and needs are met.

In many examples, the redevelopment of brownsites (post-industrial areas) have become foundations for large-scale urban greening redevelopment.  These sites are typical of past industrial landscapes - near the downtown core and waterfront and in need of environmental remediation. Environmental redevelopments often promote sustainability through urban planning mechanisms such as [[New Urbanism|new urbanism]] which promotes that planning that focus on building cities that are [[livable]] and [[Walkability|walkable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Home from nowhere: remaking our everyday world for the twenty-first century|last=Kuntsler|first=James Howard|publisher=A touchstone book|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[File:Diagonal Mar after.jpg|thumb|An image of Diagonal Mar after redevelopment.]]
A 15-year study (1990-2005) examined the social impacts or enhancing urban green spaces across the city of [[Barcelona]].  During the 1990s and 2000s, 18 new urban green parks were added to the city planning agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parcs I|first=Jardins Barcelona|date=2007|title=In Memoria|url=|journal=Barcelona: Ajuntament de Barcelona, Parcs I Jardins|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First and foremost, as Barcelona was awarded the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympic Games]], the city prepared for the event through numerous urban developments which influenced a transformation of [[public space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anguelovski|first=Isabelle|date=2014|title=Neighborhood as a refuge: community reconstruction, place remaking, and environmental justice in the city|url=|journal=MIT Press|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the city had been concerned with providing [[urban park]]s for the purpose of socializing and exercising.  However, as the Olympics were  swiftly approaching, urban planners and city governments took the opportunity to develop green spaces for mega-events.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anguelovski|first=Isabelle|date=2017|title=Assessing green gentrification in historically disenfranchised neighborhoods:  a longitudinal and spatial analysis of Barcelona|url=|journal=Urban Geography|volume=|pages=1–34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These new types of spaces prioritize the aesthetic features of urban green space in an effort to attract tourists and offer memorable landscapes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The legacy of mega-event [[urban park]]s can be observed in three notable parks around the city - Parc del Port Olimpic, Parc del Poblenou and Parc de Diagnol Mar.  All three of these parks have shifted neighborhood demographics towards greater affluence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The city of Barcelona released its plan for [[sustainability]] titled ''Barcelona Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plan 2020.''  This document does not contain plans for housing affordability or social impacts that are a result from large-scale development.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Diagonal Mar project provides an example of the green initiatives being coupled with large-scale [[Urban planning|urban redevelopment]] on a previous brownfield site.  Historically, the area was an industry hub as it is located near the [[Mediterranean Sea]].  The [[Diagonal Mar i el Front Marítim del Poblenou|Diagonal Mar]] project includes luxury condominiums, three hotels, three office buildings, a shopping mall nested within an urban green space.  The project has been criticized for not considering local input into planning as lacking spaces for social interactions for citizens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sauri|first=David|date=2009|title=Changing conceptions of sustainability in Barcelona's public parks|url=|journal=Geographical Review|volume=99.1|pages=23–36|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies suggest that green [[gentrification]] has occurred in correspondence with park development in the [[Sant Martí (district)|Sant Marti]] district.  Using neighbourhood measurements of wealth, the authors suggest that demographic shifts of the neighbourhood have taken place at an alarming rate 1990-2005.  Moreover, areas surrounding parks have experienced clear indicators of these changes as there has been an increase in:  residents with a bachelor's degree,  residents from the global North, household income or home sale and an overall decrease in the population of residents 65 and older living alone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===== The High Line =====
[[File:Highline after.jpg|thumb|An image of the High Line after its redevelopment.]]
The [[High Line]], is a 1.45-mile-long (2.33&amp;nbsp;km) an elevated public park that was constructed on a historic freight line along the west side of [[Manhattan]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921033407/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/new-high-line-section-opens-extending-park-34th-st-article-1.1946927|title=New High Line section opens, extending the park to 34th St|last=Green|first=F|date=September 21, 2014|work=Daily News|access-date=February 23, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous to its [[redevelopment]], the [[High Line]] represented the deterioration of New York’s industry, the neighbourhood of alongside the High Line, Chelsea, had frequent delinquency.  Since the 1980s the city government has attempted to tear down this eyesore.  In response, activists ventured to save this icon of history and instead promoted the idea that the [[High Line]] could be returned to the community as a provision of public good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=High Line:  The inside story of New York city's park in the sky|last=David|first=Joshua|last2=Hammond|first2=Robert|publisher=FSG Originals|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the High Line was acquired by the [[CSX Transportation]] Inc. in 1999, community board meetings provided an avenue for alternative uses to be proposed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loughran|first=Kevin|date=2014|title=Parks for profit:  The high line, growth machines, and uneven development of urban public spaces|url=|journal=City &amp; Community|volume=13.1|pages=49–68|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around the same time, Joshua David and Robert Hammond formed a non-profit they called [[Friends of the High Line]] of which their main goal was to acquire public and private funds to save the bridge from demolition.  Notable celebrities - [[Edward Norton]], [[Martha Stewart]] and [[Kevin Bacon]] provided financial support for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/08/arts/design/how-everyone-jumped-aboard-a-railroad-to-nowhere.html|title=How everyone jumped aboard a railroad to nowhere|last=Demonchaux|first=Thomas|date=May 8, 2005|work=|access-date=February 23, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Friends of the High Line presented a redevelopment strategy to the [[Mayoralty of Michael Bloomberg|Bloomberg administration]], promoting that the bridge could be converted into a public park.  [[High Line|Friends Of the High Line]] suggested that this would provide economic benefits to the surrounding neighborhood and generate substantial tax revenues.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/06/nyregion/with-next-phase-ready-area-around-high-line-is-flourishing.html|title=The High Line isn't just a sight to see; it's also an economic dynamo|last=McGeehan|first=Patrick|date=June 5, 2011|work=New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Mayoralty of Michael Bloomberg|Bloomberg administration]] accepted the initiative.  Mayor Bloomberg provided a statement of support by stating, “The Board’s ruling is a great win for all New Yorkers.  It allows us to implement our plans to preserve this valuable historic resource, create a much needed public open space and strengthen our city’s economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehighline.org/|title=Mayor authorization for High Line project [press release]|last=Friends of the High Line|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence that this project has ignited [[gentrification]] can be observed through the soaring real estate prices as well as types of activities that are being attracted to the [[High Line]] and its surrounding areas.  In just two years, there has been a production of $2 Billion real-estate construction which has contributed an additional $900 million in tax revenues.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Additionally, the relocation of [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] nearby sheds light on the popularity of the park.

The [[High Line]], although presented as a public park, privileges certain users and activities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  [[Friends of the High Line]] allow for only certain types of vendors as well as provides private security guards.  Visitors of the High Line can enjoy artisanal foods, micro-brewed beer and browse up-scaled art merchant booths.  The promotion of economic growth and certain types of consumption coupled with surveillance results in the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberalization]] of this public spaces.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Which is to say, The High Line, although a famous icon for the city, may fall short of providing open spaces and benefits for ''all'' citizens to use and enjoy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Instead it more closely resembles a place of spatial 'privileged'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=PrivilegeL  A Reader|last=Kimmel|first=Michael|publisher=Westview Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=Boulder, CO|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where claims to public space are dominated by upper-class citizens.

Concurrently in 2007, the Bloomberg administration released the ''[[PlaNYC|PlaNYC 2030: A Greater, Greener New York]]'' which aimed to combat climate change through expanding sustainability measured with 132 initiatives.  One goal highlights the social pillar of sustainability by having a goal that every citizen in the city will have a green space within a 10-minute walking distance from their home.

==== Vancouver ====

===== False Creek =====
The traditional urban layout of [[Vancouver]] was reminiscent of a small-town.  Grid-iron patterned streets were lined with single-family dwellings, businesses could be found along main streets and industry was concentrated along shorelines and inlets.  The 1960s ushered in a shift towards higher densities through high rise residential buildings in the downtown core.  In the 1980s, redevelopment of [[Brownfield land|brownsites]] (former industrial areas) for condominium development in the [[False Creek]] region was a result of it being the site for [[Expo 67|Expo 1986]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mills|first=Caroline A.|date=1988|title="Life on the upslope":  the postmodern landscape of gentrification|url=|journal=Society and Space|volume=6 |issue=2|pages=169–190|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously, this area was the heartland of industry and had begun to deteriorate as industry shifted.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  After the [[Expo 67|Expo]] the site was acquired by Hong Kong billionaire [[Li Ka-shing|Li Ka-Shing]] for $320 million and a numerous residential luxury developments followed suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olda|first=K.|date=1998|title=Globalization and urban change: tales from Vancouver via Hong Kong|url=|journal=Urban Geography|volume=19 |issue=4|pages=360–385|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These developments promoted a tone of [[sustainability]] that were supported through planning documents such as Livable Region Strategic Planning (1996).  Urban planning strategies such as [[Smart growth|Smart Growth]] stressed environmental goals could be achieved through the provision of [[Walkability|walkable]] and [[Mixed-use development|mixed-use]] urban areas which would reduce [[urban sprawl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krueger|first=Rob|date=2005|title=Sustainability schizophrenia or "actually existing sustainabilities? toward a broader understanding of politics and promises of local sustainability in the US|url=|journal=Geoforum|volume=|pages=410–417|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critiques of [[Smart growth|Smart Growth]] highlight the often ignored equity aspects of the strategy as they often ignore low-income residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pozdena|first=Randal J.|date=2002|title=Smart growth and its effects on housing markets:  the new segregation|url=|journal=National Center for Public Policy Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Affordable housing in Canada|Housing affordability]] became an issue during 2001-2007 as the price for a typical two-bedroom in the west end of Vancouver shifted from $260,000 to $650,000.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Marc|date=2008|title=Affordable EcoDensity - Making affordable housing a core principle of Vancouver's EcoDensity charter|url=|journal=The Canadian Center for Policy Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, the city council accepted [[EcoDensity]] as a solution to housing affordability which promoted further [[Urban density|densification]] of downtown and surrounding neighbourhoods.  [[EcoDensity]] is the solution to housing affordability rather than provision of social housing.  A number of towers were constructed in the downtown Eastside displaced approximately 4,000 low-income residents from June 2007-January 2008.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Critiques of [[EcoDensity]], suggest that the strategy does not account for enough citizen input in planning measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New growth-management experiments in Canada|last=Robinson|first=Pamela|publisher=Planning for climate change: strategies for mitigation and adaptation for spatial planners|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vancouver]] has become one of the most popular cities in the world to live as it offers breathtaking mountain views and access to numerous beaches.  As Vancouver was awarded the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], which led to the development of “Millenium Water” along the South Eastern portion of [[False Creek]] which became the site for the [[Olympic village 2010|Olympic Athlete Village]].  This project boasted European-styled walkways, [[green roof]]s and [[sustainability]] characteristics.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millenniumwater.com|title=Vancouver's last waterfront community|last=Millenium Water|first=|date=2008|website=|access-date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No low-income housing was provided with this project and one-bedroom condos starting price was $500,000.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  In an effort to reduce [[Environmental issue|ecological impacts]], the project promoted a [[habitat restoration]] project whereby leftover dirt was used to create an island for bird nesting.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  In 2006, water squatters, people living in boats in [[False Creek]] waters, were evicted in an effort to clean up the area.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  The [[False Creek]] redevelopment was advertised as a park-like nature for new residents and tourists and promoted as a space for leisure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The intemperate rainforest: nature, culture and power on Canada's west coast|last=Braun|first=Bruce|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars suggest that there is a disconnect between the promotion of environmental discourses and issues of equity which results in a [[class conflict]] over space in the city.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  Although Vancouver is a highly desirable place to live, the promotion of sustainability through policies ignores provision of much needed affordable housing allocations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6867">'''Feminist bookstores''' are retail bookstores that sell material relating to women's issues, [[Gender identity|gender]], and sexuality. These stores served as some of the earliest open spaces for feminist community building and organizing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-elTAQAAQBAJ|title=Feminist Revolution in Literacy: Women's Bookstores in the United States|last=Onosaka|first=Junko|date=2013-10-14|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135499150|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the spread of feminist bookstores, bookselling was a trade dominated by white men in the United States. There was a lack of awareness and interest within this bookstore leadership to meet the demands for woman-centered literature being raised by feminists at the time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though some bookstores featured small sections of women's literature or feminist books, these were limited and did not provide the range and depth representative of this category, treating topics not centered around men as an extra section of bookshops rather than an integral part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Travis|first=Trysh|date=2008-09-12|title=The Women in Print Movement: History and Implications|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/247789|journal=Book History|volume=11|issue=1|pages=275–300|doi=10.1353/bh.0.0001|issn=1529-1499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Feminist bookstores emerged within this context as spaces not only for buying books, but building communities for women, lesbians, and feminists more broadly as part of the growing feminist movement of the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=99LiyVHh9V4C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=feminist+bookstores#v=onepage&amp;q=feminist%20bookstores&amp;f=false|title=Reading at Feminist Bookstores: Women's Literature, Women's Studies, and the Feminist Bookstore Network|last=Hogan|first=Kristen Amber|date=2006-01-01|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9780542770135|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[independent bookstore]]s formed a network across the United States and abroad during the 1960s as part of the [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feminist Bookstore Movement: Lesbian Antiracism and Feminist Accountability|last=Hogan|first=Kristen|date=2016-04-15|publisher=Duke University Press Books|isbn=9780822361299|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their function as booksellers, feminist bookstores served as places of learning and organizing for social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liddle|first=Kathleen|date=2005-07-12|title=More than a Bookstore|journal=Journal of Lesbian Studies|volume=9|issue=1–2|pages=145–159|doi=10.1300/J155v09n01_14|issn=1089-4160|pmid=19780272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many feminist bookstores were collectively run by boards of women in a non-hierarchical structure. This was an anti-capitalist business model in line with second-wave feminists' belief that system change was needed in order to create meaningful change in women's lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kpNarH7t9CkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=love,+feminists+who+changed+america#v=onepage&amp;q=love,%20feminists%20who%20changed%20america&amp;f=false|title=Feminists Who Changed America, 1963-1975|last=Love|first=Barbara J.|date=2006-09-22|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252031892|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The call for more diverse types of feminist and lesbian spaces took place in-part because [[queer]] businesses and locations for community building were few and far between, with the notable exception of the [[gay bar]] scene{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Even within explicitly [[LGBT|LBGT]] (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans) spaces lesbians were ostracized, in addition to the broader societal discrimination which they faced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdjNDvvlFbEC|title=The World Split Open: How the Modern Women's Movement Changed America|last=Rosen|first=Ruth|date=2013-02-05|publisher=Tantor eBooks|isbn=9781618030986|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist bookstores were created in part to combat this [[homophobia]] and [[lesbophobia]], in response to the lack of safe spaces for lesbians and bisexual women.

==Establishment of Gender and Women's Studies==

Feminist bookstores were essential to the establishment and growth of feminist studies in the [[academy]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By consolidating [[List of feminist literature|feminist literature]] and providing spaces for open discussion of issues relating to women, these bookshops became incubators for feminist intellectuals. [[Critical race theory|Critical race]] and gender theories were produced in part by these intellectuals and activists, and feminist bookstores were key to developing the content necessary for the field to be established in the academy. Because these bookstores were open to the public and provided resources through the products sold as well as the women who ran the shops, people who had never had access to that knowledge before then had access. This enabled a more widespread call for [[Gender studies|gender]] and [[women's studies]] as a department at universities across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mantilla|first=Karla|year=2007|title=Feminist Bookstores: Where Women's Lives Matter|url=|journal=Off Our Backs|volume=37|pages=48–50|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues and Responses to Feminist Bookstores ==
Though many bookstores were intentional about creating a board of owners that was diverse so as to represent diverse experiences of being a woman, [[white feminism]] was a present issue within some leadership. In the case of A Woman's Place Bookstore, this lack of understanding of [[intersectionality]] led to the eventual deterioration of the cooperative board and a high-profile legal debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c83779bq/|title=A Woman's Place Bookstore records|website=www.oac.cdlib.org|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way women of color dealt with this environment was to open businesses run by and centered around their own experiences and made to raise up experiences of other women of color. [[Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press|Kitchen Table Press]] is one such example; this was a publishing company that produced literature exclusively written by women of color from all backgrounds and then sold to the public, often through feminist bookstores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Barbara|date=1989-01-01|title=A Press of Our Own Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press|jstor=3346433|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=10|issue=3|pages=11–13|doi=10.2307/3346433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flexible electronics''', also known as ''flex circuits'', is a [[technology]] for assembling [[electronic circuit]]s by mounting electronic devices on [[Flexibility|flexible]] [[plastic]] [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]]s, such as [[polyimide]], [[PEEK]] or transparent conductive polyester&lt;ref&gt;D. Shavit: The developments of LEDs and SMD Electronics on transparent conductive Polyester film, Vacuum International, 1/2007, S. 35 ff&lt;/ref&gt; film. Additionally, flex circuits can be [[screen printing|screen printed]] silver circuits on [[polyester]]. Flexible electronic assemblies may be manufactured using identical components used for rigid [[printed circuit board]]s, allowing the board to conform to a desired shape, or to flex during its use. An alternative approach to flexible electronics suggests various etching techniques to thin down the traditional silicon substrate to few tens of micrometers to gain reasonable flexibility, referred to as [[flexible silicon]] (~ 5&amp;nbsp;mm bending radius).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghoneim|first1=Mohamed T.|last2=Alfaraj|first2=Nasir|last3=Torres-Sevilla|first3=Galo A.|last4=Fahad|first4=Hossain M.|last5=Hussain|first5=Muhammad M.|title=Out-of-Plane Strain Effects on Physically Flexible FinFET CMOS|journal=IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices|date=July 2016|volume=63|issue=7|pages=2657–2664|doi=10.1109/TED.2016.2561239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alfaraj|first1=Nasir|last2=Hussain|first2=Aftab M.|last3=Torres Sevilla|first3=Galo A.|last4=Ghoneim|first4=Mohamed T.|last5=Rojas|first5=Jhonathan P.|last6=Aljedaani|first6=Abdulrahman B.|last7=Hussain|first7=Muhammad M.|title=Functional integrity of flexible n-channel metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors on a reversibly bistable platform|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=26 October 2015|volume=107|issue=17|pages=174101|doi=10.1063/1.4934355|url=http://repository.kaust.edu.sa/kaust/bitstream/10754/582486/1/1.4934355.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghoneim|first1=Mohamed T.|last2=Zidan|first2=Mohammed A.|last3=Salama|first3=Khaled N.|last4=Hussain|first4=Muhammad M.|title=Towards neuromorphic electronics: Memristors on foldable silicon fabric|journal=Microelectronics Journal|date=November 2014|volume=45|issue=11|pages=1392–1395|doi=10.1016/j.mejo.2014.07.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rojas|first1=Jhonathan Prieto|last2=Ghoneim|first2=Mohamed Tarek|last3=Young|first3=Chadwin D.|last4=Hussain|first4=Muhammad Mustafa|title=Flexible High-&lt;formula formulatype="inline"&gt;&lt;tex Notation="TeX"&gt;$\kappa$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt;/Metal Gate Metal/Insulator/Metal Capacitors on Silicon (100) Fabric|journal=IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices|date=October 2013|volume=60|issue=10|pages=3305–3309|doi=10.1109/TED.2013.2278186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kutbee|first1=Arwa T.|last2=Ghoneim|first2=Mohamed T.|last3=Ahmad|first3=Sally M.|last4=Hussain|first4=Muhammad M.|title=Free-Form Flexible Lithium-Ion Microbattery|journal=IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology|date=May 2016|volume=15|issue=3|pages=402–408|doi=10.1109/TNANO.2016.2537338}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghoneim|first1=Mohamed|last2=Hussain|first2=Muhammad|title=Review on Physically Flexible Nonvolatile Memory for Internet of Everything Electronics|journal=Electronics|date=23 July 2015|volume=4|issue=3|pages=424–479|doi=10.3390/electronics4030424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghoneim|first1=M.

==Manufacturing==
Flexible printed circuits (FPC) are made with a photolithographic technology. An alternative way of making flexible foil circuits or [[flexible flat cable]]s (FFCs) is laminating very thin (0.07&amp;nbsp;mm) copper strips in between two layers of [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]]. These PET layers, typically 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm thick, are coated with an adhesive which is [[thermoset]]ting, and will be activated during the lamination process. FPCs and FFCs have several advantages in many applications:
* Tightly assembled electronic packages, where electrical connections are required in 3 axes, such as [[cameras]] (static application).
* Electrical connections where the assembly is required to flex during its normal use, such as folding [[cell phones]] (dynamic application).
* Electrical connections between sub-assemblies to replace wire harnesses, which are heavier and bulkier, such as in cars, [[rocket]]s and [[satellites]].
* Electrical connections where board thickness or space constraints are driving factors.

===Advantage of FPCs===
* Potential to replace multiple rigid boards or connectors
* Single-sided circuits are ideal for dynamic or high-flex applications
* Stacked FPCs in various configurations

===Disadvantages of FPCs===
* Cost increase over rigid PCBs
* Increased risk of damage during handling or use
* More difficult assembly process
* Repair and rework is difficult or impossible
* Generally worse panel utilization resulting in increased cost

==Applications==
Flex circuits are often used as connectors in various applications where flexibility, space savings, or production constraints limit the serviceability of rigid circuit boards or hand wiring. A common application of flex circuits is in computer keyboards; most keyboards use flex circuits for the [[Keyboard technology#Keyboard switch matrix|switch matrix]].

In [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] fabrication, glass is used as a substrate.  If thin flexible plastic or metal foil is used as the substrate instead, the entire system can be flexible, as the film deposited on top of the substrate is usually very thin, on the order of a few micrometres.

[[Organic light-emitting diode]]s (OLEDs) are normally used instead of a back-light for flexible displays, making a [[flexible organic light-emitting diode]] display.

Most flexible circuits are passive wiring structures that are used to interconnect electronic components such as integrated circuits, resistors, capacitors and the like, however some are used only for making interconnections between other electronic assemblies either directly or by means of connectors.

In the automotive field, flexible circuits are used in instrument panels, under-hood controls, circuits to be concealed within the headliner of the cabin, and in ABS systems. In computer peripherals flexible circuits are used on the moving print head of printers, and to connect signals to the moving arm carrying the read/write heads of disk drives. Consumer electronics devices make use of flexible circuits in cameras, personal entertainment devices, calculators, or exercise monitors.

Flexible circuits are found in industrial and medical devices where many interconnections are required in a compact package. Cellular telephones are another widespread example of flexible circuits.

Flexible [[solar cell]]s have been developed for powering [[satellite]]s.  These cells are lightweight, can be rolled up for launch, and are easily deployable, making them a good match for the application.  They can also be sewn into backpacks or outerwear.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance the [[Scottevest]] solar jacket and the Voltaic [http://www.voltaicsystems.com/offgrid.shtml] and similar solar backpacks.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Patent]]s issued at the turn of the 20th century show that early researchers were envisioning ways of making flat conductors sandwiched between layers of [[Insulator (electrical)|insulating material]] to layout [[electrical circuit]]s to serve in early [[telephony]] switching applications. One of the earliest descriptions of what could be called a flex circuit was unearthed by Dr Ken Gilleo&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.et-trends.com/files/Circuits_100Years.pdf|title=et-trends.com - This website is for sale! - et-trends Resources and Information.|author=|date=|website=www.et-trends.com |deadurl=usurped}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; and disclosed in an English patent by Albert Hansen in 1903 where Hansen described a construction consisting of flat metal conductors on [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]] [[coated paper]]. [[Thomas Edison]]’s lab books from the same period also indicate that he was thinking to coat patterns [[cellulose gum]] applied to linen paper with [[graphite]] powder to create what would have clearly been flexible circuits, though there is no evidence that it was reduced to practice.

In the 1947 publication "Printed Circuit Techniques" by Cledo Brunetti and Roger W. Curtis&lt;ref&gt;"Printed Circuit Techniques" by Cledo Brunetti and Roger w. Curtis (National Bureau of Standards Circular 468 first issued 15 November 1947)&lt;/ref&gt; a brief discussion of creating circuits on what would have been flexible insulating materials (e.g. [[paper]]) indicated that the idea was in place and in the 1950s [[Sanders Associates]]' inventors ([[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua, NH]]) Victor Dahlgren and company founder Royden Sanders made significant strides developing and patenting processes for printing and etching flat conductors on flexible base materials to replace [[wire harness]]es. An advertisement from the 1950 placed by Photocircuits Corporation in New York demonstrated their active interest in flexible circuits also.

Today, flexible circuits which are also variously known around the world variously as ''flexible printed wiring, flex print, flexi circuits,'' are used many products. Large credit is due to the efforts of [[Japan]]ese [[electronics]] packaging engineers who have found countless new ways to employ flexible circuit technology. For the last decade, flexible circuits have remained one of the fastest growing of all interconnection product market segments.  A more recent variation on flexible circuit technology is one called "flexible electronics" which commonly involves the integration of both active and passive functions in the processing.

==Flexible circuit structures==
There are a few basic constructions of flexible circuits but there is significant variation between the different types in terms of their construction. Following is a review of the most common types of flexible circuit constructions

===Single-sided flex circuits===
Single-sided flexible circuits have a single conductor layer made of either a metal or conductive (metal filled) polymer on a flexible [[dielectric]] film. Component termination features are accessible only from one side. Holes may be formed in the base film to allow component leads to pass through for interconnection, normally by [[soldering]]. Single sided flex circuits can be fabricated with or without such protective coatings as cover layers or cover coats, however the use of a [[protective coating]] over circuits is the most common practice. The development of [[Surface-mount technology|surface mounted devices]] on sputtered conductive films has enabled the production of transparent LED Films, which is used in [[Transparent LED embedded glass|LED Glass]] but also in flexible [[LED Headliner|automotive lighting composites]].

===Double access or back bared flex circuits===
Double access flex, also known as back bared flex, are flexible circuits having a single conductor layer but which is processed so as to allow access to selected features of the conductor pattern from both sides. While this type of circuit has certain benefits, the specialized processing requirements for accessing the features limits its use.

===Sculptured flex circuits===
Sculptured flex circuits are a novel subset of normal flexible circuit structures. The [[manufacturing]] process involves a special flex circuit multi-step etching method which yields a flexible circuit having finished [[copper]] conductors wherein the thickness of the conductor differs at various places along their length. (i.e., the conductors are thin in flexible areas and thick at interconnection points.).

===Double-sided flex circuits===
Double-sided flex circuits are flex circuits having two conductor layers. These flex circuits can be fabricated with or without plated [[Through-hole technology|through holes]], though the plated through hole variation is much more common. When constructed without plated through holes and connection features are accessed from one side only, the circuit is defined as a "Type V (5)" according to military specifications. It is not a common practice but it is an option. Because of the plated through hole, terminations for electronic components are provided for on both sides of the circuit, thus allowing components to be placed on either side. Depending on design requirements, double-sided flex circuits can be fabricated with protective coverlayers on one, both or neither side of the completed circuit but are most commonly produced with the protective layer on both sides. One major advantage of this type of substrate is that it allows crossover connections to be made very easy. Many single sided circuits are built on a double sided substrate just because they have one of two crossover connections. An example of this use is the circuit connecting a [[mousepad]] to the motherboard of a laptop. All connections on that circuit are located on only one side of the substrate, except a very small crossover connection which uses the second side of the substrate.

===Multilayer flex circuits===
Flex circuits having three or more layers of conductors are known as multilayer flex circuits. Commonly the layers are interconnected by means of plated through holes, though this is not a requirement of the definition for it is possible to provide openings to access lower circuit level features. The layers of the multilayer flex circuit may or may not be continuously laminated together throughout the construction with the obvious exception of the areas occupied by plated through-holes. The practice of discontinuous lamination is common in cases where maximum flexibility is required. This is accomplished by leaving unbonded the areas where flexing or bending is to occur.

===Rigid-flex circuits===
Rigid-flex circuits are a hybrid construction flex circuit consisting of rigid and flexible substrates which are laminated together into a single structure. Rigid-flex circuits should not be confused with rigidized flex constructions, which are simply flex circuits to which a stiffener is attached to support the weight of the electronic components locally. A rigidized or stiffened flex circuit can have one or more conductor layers. Thus while the two terms may sound similar, they represent products that are quite different.

The layers of a rigid flex are also normally electrically interconnected by means of plated through holes. Over the years, rigid-flex circuits have enjoyed tremendous popularity among military product designer, however the technology has found increased use in commercial products. While often considered a specialty product for low volume applications because of the challenges, an impressive effort to use the technology was made by Compaq computer in the production of boards for a laptop computer in the 1990s. While the computer's main rigid-flex PCBA did not flex during use, subsequent designs by Compaq utilized rigid-flex circuits for the hinged display cable, passing 10s of 1000s of flexures during testing. By 2013, the use of rigid-flex circuits in consumer laptop computers is now common.

Rigid-flex boards are normally multilayer structures; however, two metal layer constructions are sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gcaflex.com/flexible-circuits/rigid-flex-circuits/|title=Rigid Flex Circuits, Flexible Circuits, Flex Circuit Boards, PCB Flex {{!}} GC Aero Flexible Circuitry, Inc.|website=gcaflex.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polymer thick film flex circuits===
Polymer thick film (PTF) flex circuits are true printed circuits in that the conductors are actually printed onto a polymer base film. They are typically single conductor layer structures, however two or more metal layers can be printed sequentially with insulating layers printed between printed conductor layers, or on both sides. While lower in conductor conductivity and thus not suitable for all applications, PTF circuits have successfully served in a wide range of low-power applications at slightly higher voltages. Keyboards are a common application, however, there are a wide range of potential applications for this cost-effective approach to flex circuit manufacture.

==Flexible circuit materials==
Each element of the flex circuit construction must be able to consistently meet the demands placed upon it for the life of the product. In addition, the material must work reliably in concert with the other elements of the flexible circuit construction to assure ease of manufacture and reliability. Following are brief descriptions of the basic elements of flex circuit construction and their functions.

===Base material===
The base material is the flexible polymer film which provides the foundation for the laminate. Under normal circumstances, the flex circuit base material provides most primary physical and electrical properties of the flexible circuit. In the case of adhesiveless circuit constructions, the base material provides all of the characteristic properties.
While a wide range of thickness is possible, most flexible films are provided in a narrow range of relatively thin dimension from 12&amp;nbsp;µm to 125&amp;nbsp;µm (1/2 mil to 5 mils) but thinner and thicker material are possible. Thinner materials are of course more flexible and for most material, stiffness increase is proportional to the cube of thickness. Thus for example, means that if the thickness is doubled, the material becomes eight times stiffer and will only deflect 1/8 as much under the same load.
There are a number of different materials used as base films including: polyester (PET), polyimide (PI), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyetherimide (PEI), along with various fluropolymers (FEP) and copolymers. Polyimide films are most prevalent owing to their blend of advantageous electrical, mechanical, chemical and thermal properties.

===Bonding adhesive===
Adhesives are used as the bonding medium for creating a laminate. When it comes to temperature resistance, the adhesive is typically the performance limiting element of a laminate especially when polyimide is the base material. Because of the earlier difficulties associated with polyimide adhesives, many polyimide flex circuits presently employ adhesive systems of different polymer families. However some newer thermoplastic polyimide adhesives are making important in-roads.
As with the base films, adhesives come in different thickness. Thickness selection is typically a function of the application. For example, different adhesive thickness is commonly used in the creation of cover layers in order to meet the fill demands of different copper foil thickness which may be encountered.

===Metal foil===
A metal foil is most commonly used as the conductive element of a flexible laminate. The metal foil is the material from which the circuit paths are normally etched. A wide variety of metal foils of varying thickness are available from which to choose and create a flex circuit, however copper foils, serve the vast majority of all flexible circuit applications. Copper’s excellent balance of cost and physical and electrical performance attributes make it an excellent choice. There are actually many different types of copper foil. The IPC identifies eight different types of copper foil for printed circuits divided into two much broader categories, electrodeposited and wrought, each having four sub-types.) As a result, there are a number of different types of copper foil available for flex circuit applications to serve the varied purposes of different end products. With most copper foil, a thin surface treatment is commonly applied to one side of the foil to improve its adhesion to the base film. Copper foils are of two basic types: wrought (rolled) and electrodeposited and their properties are quite different. Rolled and annealed foils are the most common choice, however thinner films which are electroplated are becoming increasingly popular.

In certain non standard cases, the circuit manufacturer may be called upon to create a specialty laminate by using a specified alternative metal foil, such as a special copper alloy or other metal foil in the construction. This is accomplished by laminating the foil to a base film with or without an adhesive depending on the nature and properties of the base film.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Flexible circuit industry standards and specifications==
Specifications are developed to provide a common ground of understanding of what a product should look like and how it should perform. Standards are developed directly by manufacturer's associations such as the [[IPC (electronics)|Association Connecting Electronics Industries]] (IPC) and by users of flexible circuits.

In music, a '''''Flute method''''' is a kind of specific [[textbook]] style manual for playing the [[Western concert flute|flute]]. It usually contains [[Fingering (music)|fingering]] charts and/or [[musical scale|scales]] and numerous different [[exercise]]s, sometimes also simple [[etude]]s, in different [[key (music)|key]]s, in ascending order as to difficulty (= in methodical ''progression'') or with a focus on isolated aspects like fluency, [[rhythm]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[articulation (music)|articulation]] and the like. Sometimes there are duets or even [[recital]] pieces, also with accompaniment. Such methods differ from etude books in that they are meant as a linear course for a student to follow, with consistent guidance, whereas volumes of etudes are not as comprehensive.

As typical instrumental methods are meant to function as textbooks supporting an instrumental teacher (rather than to facilitate self-teaching), usually no basic or special playing techniques are covered in any depth. Detailed instructions in this respect are only found in special, [[Autodidacticism|autodidactical]] methods.

Some methods are specially tailored for students on certain [[skill]] levels or [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of psychosocial development]]. In contrast, a 'complete' method (sometimes in multiple volumes) is meant to accompany the student until he or she becomes an advanced player.

Methods of certain authors or editors have achieved the status of standard works (reflecting regional and cultural differences) and are published or reissued by different [[publishing]] companies and often in new layouts or [[arrangement]]s. The [[Suzuki Method]] is one of the most well known examples of this.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21691">'''Functional integration''' is the study of how brain regions try work together to process information and effect responses. Though functional integration frequently relies on anatomic knowledge of the connections between brain areas, the emphasis is on how large clusters of neurons – numbering in the thousands or millions – fire together under various stimuli. The large datasets required for such a whole-scale picture of brain function have motivated the development of several novel and general methods for the statistical analysis of interdependence, such as dynamic causal modelling and statistical linear parametric mapping. These datasets are typically gathered in human subjects by non-invasive methods such as [[Electroencephalography|EEG]]/[[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]], [[fMRI]], or [[Positron emission tomography|PET]]. The results can be of clinical value by helping to identify the regions responsible for psychiatric disorders, as well as to assess how different activities or lifestyles affect the functioning of the brain.

== Imaging techniques ==
{{Main|Neuroimaging}}

A study's choice of imaging modality depends on the desired spatial and temporal resolution. fMRI and PET offer relatively high spatial resolution, with [[voxel]] dimensions on the order of a few millimeters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Luca|first=M. |last2= Beckmann|first2= CF|last3=De Stefano |title=fMRI resting state networks define distinct modes of long-distance interactions in the human brain |url= |journal=NeuroImage |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=1359–67 |doi= 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.08.035 |pmid= 16260155 |first3= N |last4=Matthews |first4= PM |last5=Smith |first5= SM|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but their relatively low sampling rate hinders the observation of rapid and transient interactions between distant regions of the brain. These temporal limitations are overcome by MEG, but at the cost of only detecting signals from much larger clusters of neurons.&lt;ref name = "BB"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hamalainen, M.|title=Magnetoencephalography-theory, instrumentation, and applications to noninvasive studies of the working human brain|journal=Rev. Mod. Phys. |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=413–97 |year=1993 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.65.413 |first2=Riitta |last3=Ilmoniemi|first3=Risto J. |last4=Knuutila|first4=Jukka |last5=Lounasmaa|first5=Olli V.|last2=Hari |bibcode=1993RvMP...65..413H|url=https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi:443/bitstream/123456789/18757/1/A1_h%c3%a4m%c3%a4l%c3%a4inen_matti_1993.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===fMRI===
{{Main|Functional magnetic resonance imaging}}

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a form of MRI that is most frequently used to take advantage of a difference in magnetism between [[Hemoglobin|oxy-]] and [[Hemoglobin|deoxyhemoglobin]] to assess blood flow to different parts of the brain. Typical sampling rates for fMRI images are in the tenths of seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Nikos Logothetis|Logothetis, N. K.]]|title=What we can do and what we cannot do with fMRI|journal=Nature |volume=453 |issue=7197 |pages=869–78 |year=2008 |doi=10.1038/nature06976|url=http://kyb.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/files/publications/attachments/NikosNatureJune2008_%5B0%5D.pdf |pmid=18548064|bibcode = 2008Natur.453..869L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MEG===
{{Main|Magnetoencephalography}}

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is an imaging modality that uses very sensitive magnetometers to measure the magnetic fields resulting from ionic currents flowing through neurons in the brain. High-quality MEG machines allow for sub-millisecond sampling rates.&lt;ref name = "BB" /&gt;

===PET===
{{Main|Positron emission tomography}}

PET works by introducing a radiolabeled biologically active molecule. The choice of molecule dictates what is visualized: by using a radiolabeled analog of glucose, for example, one can obtain an image whose intensity distribution indicates metabolic activity. PET scanners offer sampling rates in the tenths of seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bailey |first=DL |year=2005 |title=Positron Emission Tomography: Basic Sciences |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-1-84628-007-8 |oclc=209853466|doi=10.1007/b136169 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multimodal imaging===
{{Main|History of neuroimaging|l1=Multimodal imaging}}

Multimodal imaging frequently consists of the coupling of an electrophysiologic measurement technique, such as EEG or MEG, with a hemodynamic one such as fMRI or PET. While the intention is to use the strengths and limitations of each to complement the other, current approaches suffer from experimental limitations.&lt;ref name = "CC"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rosa, MJ|title=EEG-fMRI integration: a critical review of biophysical modeling and data analysis approaches|journal=Journal of Integrative Neuroscience |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=453–76 |year=2010 |pmid=21213414 |doi=10.1142/S0219635210002512 |first2=J |last3=Friston|first3=KJ|last2=Daunizeau}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some previous work has focused on attempting to use the high spatial resolution of fMRI to determine the (spatial) origin of EEG/MEG signals, so that in future work this spatial information could be extracted from a unimodal EEG/MEG signal. While some studies have seen success in correlating signal origins between modalities to within a few millimeters, the results have not been uniformly positive. Another current limitation is the actual experimental setup: taking measurements using both modalities at once yields inferior signals, but the alternative of measuring each modality separately is confounded by trial-to-trial variability.&lt;ref name = "CC" /&gt;

== Modes of analysis==
In functional integration, there is a distinction drawn between ''functional'' connectivity, and ''effective'' connectivity. Two brain regions are said to be functionally connected if there is a high correlation between the times that the two are firing, though this does not imply causality. Effective connectivity, on the other hand, is a description of the causal relationship between various brain regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Friston, K. |year=2002 |title=Functional integration and inference in the brain|journal=Progress in Neurobiology |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=113–43 |doi= 10.1016/s0301-0082(02)00076-x|pmid=12450490|citeseerx=10.1.1.318.4536 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While statistical assessment of the functional connectivity of multiple brain regions is non-trivial, determining the causality of which brain regions influence which to fire is much thornier, and requires solutions to ill-posed optimization problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Friston, K. |year=2003 |title=Dynamic causal modelling|journal=NeuroImage   |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=1273–302 |pmid = 12948688 |doi =10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00202-7 |first2 =L |last3=Penny |first3 =W|last2=Harrison }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamic causal modelling===
{{Main|Dynamic causal modelling}}

Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) is a Bayesian method for deducing the structure of a neural system based on the observed hemodynamic (fMRI) or electrophysiologic (EEG/MEG) signal. The first step is to make a prediction as to the relationships between the brain regions of interest, and formulate a system of ordinary differential equations describing the causal relationship between them, although many parameters (and relationships) will be initially unknown. Using previous results on how neural activity is known to translate into fMRI or EEG signals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Buxton, RB |year=1998 |title=Dynamics of blood flow and oxygenation changes during brain activation: the balloon model |journal=Magnetic Resonance in Medicine |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=855–64 |pmid=9621908 |doi =10.1002/mrm.1910390602 |first2 =EC |last3=Frank |first3 =LR |last2=Wong }}&lt;/ref&gt; one can take the measured signal and determine the likelihood that model parameters have particular values. The elucidated model can then be used to predict relationships between the considered brain regions under different conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Stephan, KE |year=2010 |title=Ten simple rules for dynamic causal modeling  |journal=NeuroImage |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=3099–109 |pmid=19914382 |doi =10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.11.015 |first2 =WD |last3=Moran |first3 =RJ |last4=Den Ouden |first4 =HE |last5=Daunizeau |first5 =J |last6=Friston |first6 =KJ |pmc =2825373|last2=Penny }}&lt;/ref&gt; A key factor to consider during the design of neuroimaging experiments involving DCM is the relationship between the timing of tasks or stimuli presented to the subject and the ability of DCM to determine the underlying relationships between brain regions, which is partially determined by the temporal resolution of the imaging modality in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Daunizeau, J. |year=2011 |title=Optimizing experimental design for comparing models of brain function |journal=PLOS Computational Biology |volume=7 |issue=11 |pages= e1002280|pmid=22125485 |doi =10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002280 |first2 =K |last3=Friston |first3 =K |last4=Stephan |first4 =K |pmc =3219623 |editor1-last =Sporns |editor1-first =Olaf |last2=Preuschoff |bibcode = 2011PLSCB...7E2280D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical parametric mapping===
{{Main|Statistical parametric mapping}}

Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a method for determining whether the activation of a particular brain region changes between experimental conditions, stimuli, or over time. The essential idea is simple, and consists of two major steps: first, one performs a univariate statistical test on ''each individual voxel'' between each experimental condition.&lt;ref name = "AA"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Friston, K. |year=1995 |title=Statistical parametric maps in functional imaging: a general linear approach |journal=Human Brain Mapping |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=189–210 |doi=10.1002/hbm.460020402 |url=http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Statistical%20parametric%20maps%20in%20functional%20imaging.pdf |first2 = A. P. |last3=Worsley |first3 = K. J. |last4=Poline |first4 = J.-P. |last5=Frith |first5 = C. D. |last6=Frackowiak |first6 = R. S. J.|last2=Holmes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, one analyzes the clustering of the voxels that show [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] differences, and determines which brain regions exhibit different levels of activation under different experimental conditions.

There is great flexibility in the choice of statistical test (and thus the questions that an experiment can be designed to answer), and common choices include the [[Student's t-test|Student's t test]] or [[linear regression]]. An important consideration with SPM, however, is that the large number of comparisons requires one to control the false positive rate with a more stringent significance threshold. This can be done either by modifying the initial statistical test to decrease the α value so as to make it harder for a particular voxel to exhibit a significant difference, or by modifying the clustering analysis in the second step by only considering a brain region's activation to be significant if it contains a certain number of voxels that exhibit a statistical difference.&lt;ref name = "AA" /&gt;

===Voxel-based morphometry===
{{Main|Voxel-based morphometry}}

Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is a method that allows one to measure brain tissue composition differences between subjects. To do so, one must first register all images to a standard coordinate system, by mapping them to a reference image. This is done by use of an affine transformation that minimizes the sum-of-squares intensity difference between the experimental image and the reference. Once this is done, the proportion of [[Grey matter|grey]] or [[white matter]] in a voxel can be determined by intensity. This allows one to compare the tissue composition of corresponding brain regions between different subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Ashburner, J.|year=2000 |title=Voxel-Based Morphometry-The Methods |journal=NeuroImage |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=805–21 |pmid=10860804 |doi = 10.1006/nimg.2000.0582 |first2 = KJ |last2=Friston |citeseerx=10.1.1.114.9512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The ability to visualize whole-brain activity is frequently used in comparing brain function during various sorts of tasks or tests of skill, as well as in comparing brain structure and function between different groups of people.

===Changes in resting-state brain activation===
Many previous fMRI studies have seen that spontaneous activation of functionally connected brain regions occurs during the resting state, even in the absence of any sort of stimulation or activity. Human subjects presented with a visual learning task exhibit changes in functional connectivity in the resting state for up to 24 hours and [[dynamic functional connectivity]] studies have even shown changes in functional connectivity during a single scan. By taking fMRI scans of subjects before and after the learning task, as well as on the following day, it was shown that the activity had caused a resting-state change in [[Hippocampus|hippocampal]] activity.  Dynamic causal modeling revealed that the hippocampus also exhibited a new level of effective connectivity with the [[striatum]], though there was no learning-related change in any visual area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Urner, M.|year= 2013|title= Early visual learning induces long-lasting connectivity changes during rest in the human brain|journal=NeuroImage |volume=77|pages=148–56 |pmid=23558105 |doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.03.050 |first2 = DS |last3= Friston|first3 = K |last4= Rees|first4 = G |pmc = 3682182 |issue = 100 |last2= Schwarzkopf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining fMRI with DCM on subjects performing a learning task allows one to delineate which brain systems are involved in various sorts of learning, whether implicit or explicit, and document for long these tasks lead to changes in resting-state brain activation.

===IQ estimation===
Voxel-based morphometric measurements of grey matter localization in the brain can be used to predict components of IQ. A set of 35 teenagers were tested for [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] and were fMRI scanned over the course of 3.5 years, and had their IQ predicted by the level of grey matter localization. This study was well-conducted, but studies of this sort frequently suffer from "double-dipping," where a single dataset is used both to identify the brain regions of interest ''and'' to develop a predictive model, which leads to overtraining of the model and an absence of real predictive power.&lt;ref name = "DD"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Price, CJ|year= 2013|title=Predicting IQ change from brain structure: a cross-validation study |journal=Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=5|pages=172–84 |pmid=23567505 |doi = 10.1016/j.dcn.2013.03.001 |first2 = S |last3= Hope|first3 = TM |last4= Friston|first4 = KJ |last5= Seghier|first5 = ML |pmc = 3682176 |issue = 100 |last2= Ramsden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study authors avoided double-dipping by using a "leave-one-out" methodology, that involves building a predictive model for each of the n members of a sample based on data from the other n-1 members. This ensures that the model is independent of the subject whose IQ is being predicted, and resulted in a model capable of explaining 53% of the change in verbal IQ as a function of grey matter density in the left motor cortex. The study also observed the previously-reported phenomenon that a ranking of young subjects by IQ does not stay constant as the subjects age, which confounds any measurement of the efficacy of educational programs.&lt;ref name = "DD" /&gt;

These studies can be cross-validated by attempting to locate and assess patients with lesions or other damage in the identified brain region, and examining whether they exhibit functional deficits relative to the population. This methodology would be hindered by the lack of a "before" baseline measurement, however.

===Phonological loop===
The [[Baddeley's model of working memory|phonological loop]] is a component of working memory that stores a small set of words that can be maintained indefinitely if not distracted. The concept was proposed by the psychologists Alan Baddeley and Graham Hitch to explain how phrases or sentences can be internalized and used to direct action.
By using statistical parametric mapping to assess differences in cerebral blood flow between participants performing two different tasks, Paulescu et al.&lt;ref name="Paulesu 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paulesu E, Frith CD, Frackowiak RS |title=The neural correlates of the verbal component of working memory |journal=Nature |volume=362 |issue=6418 |pages=342–5 |date=March 1993 |pmid=8455719 |doi=10.1038/362342a0 |url=|last2=Frith |last3=Frackowiak |bibcode = 1993Natur.362..342P }}&lt;/ref&gt; were able to identify the storage of the phonological loop as in the [[Supramarginal gyrus|supramarginal gyrii]]. Human subjects were first split into a control and experimental group. The control group was presented with letters in a language they did not understand, and non-linguistic visual diagrams. The experimental group was tasked with two activities: the first activity was to remember a string of letters, and was intended activate all elements of the phonological loop. The second activity asked participants to assess whether given phrases rhymed, and was intended to only activate certain sub-systems involved in vocalization, but specifically not the phonological storage.

By comparing the first experimental task to the second, as well as to the control group, the study authors observed that the brain region most significantly activated by the task requiring phonological storage was the supramarginal gyrii. This result was backed up by previous literature observations of functional deficits in patients with damage in this area.

Though this study was able to precisely localize a specific function anatomically and the methods of functional integration and imaging are of great value in determining the brain regions involved in certain information processing tasks,  the low-level neural circuitry that gives rise to these phenomena remains mysterious.

===Psychiatric disorders===
Although fMRI studies of [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] and [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]] patients have yielded some insight into the changes in effective connectivity caused by these diseases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Calhoun, V.|year= 2011|title=Exploring the psychosis functional connectome: aberrant intrinsic networks in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder |journal=Frontiers in Psychiatry |volume=2 |issue= 75|pmid=22291663 |first2 = J |last3= Kiehl|first3 = K |last4= Turner|first4 = J |last5= Allen|first5 = E |last6= Pearlson|first6 = G |page = 75 |doi = 10.3389/fpsyt.2011.00075 |pmc = 3254121 |last2= Sui}}&lt;/ref&gt; a comprehensive understanding of the functional remodelling that occurs has not yet been achieved.

Montague et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Montague, P.|year= 2012|title= Computational psychiatry|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=72–80 |pmid= 22177032 |doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2011.11.018 |first2 = RJ |last3= Friston|first3 = KJ |last4= Dayan|first4 = P |pmc = 3556822 |last2= Dolan}}&lt;/ref&gt; note that the almost "unreasonable effectiveness of psychotropic medication" has somewhat stymied progress in this field, and advocate for a large-scale "computational phenotyping" of psychiatric patients. Neuroimaging studies of large numbers of these patients could yield brain activation markers for specific psychiatric illnesses, and also aid in the development of therapeutics and animal models. While a true baseline of brain function in psychiatric patients is near-impossible to obtain, reference values can still be measured by comparing images gathered from patients before and after treatment.

[[File:Junges Gras.jpg|thumb|Germinating [[Festuca|fescue grass]] with long, blade-like leaves]]

In [[botany]] and [[ecology]], '''graminoid''' refers to a [[herbaceous plant]] with a grass-like morphology, i.e. elongated [[culm (botany)|culms]] with long, blade-like leaves. They are contrasted to [[forbs]], herbaceous plants without grass-like features.

The plants most often referred to include the families [[Poaceae]] (grasses in the strict sense), [[Cyperaceae]] (sedges), and [[Juncaceae]] (rushes). These are not closely related but belong to different [[clade]]s in the order [[Poales]]. The grasses (Poaceae) are by far the largest family with some 12,000 species.

Besides their similar morphology, graminoids share the widespread occurrence and often dominance in open habitats such as [[grasslands]] or [[marshes]]. They can however also be found in the [[understory]] of forests. Sedges and rushes tend to prefer wetter habitats than grasses.

'''Homeokinetics''' is the study of self-organizing, [[complex systems]].&lt;ref name=homeo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeokinetics.org/pdf%20files/1978%20Physical%20Basis%20-%20Homeokinetics.pdf|title=Homeokinetics: A Physical Science for Complex Systems|author=H.

Homeokinetic physics studies the up-down processes that bind these levels. Tools such as [[mechanics]], [[quantum field theory]], and the laws of [[thermodynamics]] provide the key relationships. The subject, described as the physics and thermodynamics associated with the up down movement between levels of systems, originated in the late 1970s work of American physicists [[Harry Soodak]] and [[Arthur Iberall]]. Complex systems are [[universes]], [[galaxies]], [[social systems]], [[people]], or even those that seem as simple as [[gases]]. The basic premise is that the entire universe consists of atomistic-like units bound in interactive ensembles to form systems, level by level, in a nested hierarchy. Homeokinetics treats all complex systems on an equal footing, animate and inanimate, providing them with a common viewpoint. The complexity in studying how they work is reduced by the emergence of common languages in all complex systems.&lt;ref name=Homeok2016/&gt;

==History==
[[Arthur Iberall]], [[Warren McCulloch]] and [[Harry Soodak]] developed the concept of homeokinetics as a new branch of physics.  It began through Iberall's biophysical research for the NASA [[exobiology]] program into the dynamics of mammalian physiological processes&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A.S. and S.Z. Cardon. Analysis of the dynamic systems response of some internal human systems. Clearinghouse for Federal Scientific and Technical Information; Reports to NASA: CR-129, Oct. 1964; CR-141, Jan. l965; CR-219, May 1965; Interim Report, Dec. 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A.S., M. Ehrenberg and S.Z. Cardon. General-dynamics of the physical-chemical systems in mammals. Contractors Report to NASA, NASW-1066, Aug. 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; They were observing an area that physics has neglected, that of complex systems with their very long internal factory day delays. They were observing systems associated with nested [[hierarchy]] and with an extensive range of time scale processes.&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A.S. and S.Z. Cardon. Hierarchical regulation in the complex biological organism. Record of the IEEE Systems Science and Cybernetics Conference, Phila., October, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A.S. and W.S. McCulloch. The organizing principle of complex living systems. J. Basic Engr., ASME 290-294, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; It was such connections, referred to as both up-down or in-out connections (as nested hierarchy) and side-side or flatland physics among atomistic-like components (as [[heterarchy]]) that became the hallmark of homeokinetic problems. By 1975, they began to put a formal catch-phrase name on those complex problems, associating them with [[nature]], [[life]], [[human]], [[mind]], and [[society]]. The major method of exposition that they began using was a combination of engineering physics and a more academic pure physics. In 1981, Iberall was invited to the Crump Institute for Medical Engineering of [[UCLA]], where he further refined the key concepts of homeokinetics, developing a physical scientific foundation for complex systems.

==Self-organizing Complex Systems==

A system is a collective of interacting ‘atomistic’-like entities.&lt;ref name=Homeok2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=homeo/&gt; The word ‘atomism’ is used to stand both for the entity and the doctrine. As is known from ‘kinetic’ theory, in mobile or simple systems, the atomisms share their ‘energy’ in interactive collisions. That so-called ‘equipartitioning’ process takes place within a few collisions. Physically, if there is little or no interaction, the process is considered to be very weak. Physics deals basically with the forces of interaction—few in number—that influence the interactions. They all tend to emerge with considerable force at high ‘density’ of atomistic interaction. In complex systems, there is also a result of internal processes in the atomisms. They exhibit, in addition to the pair-by-pair interactions, internal actions such as [[vibrations]], [[rotations]], and association. If the energy and time involved internally creates a very large—in time—cycle of performance of their actions compared to their pair interactions, the collective system is complex. If you eat a cookie and you do not see the resulting action for hours, that is complex; if boy meets girl and they become ‘engaged’ for a protracted period, that is complex. What emerges from that physics is a broad host of changes in state and stability transitions in state. Viewing [[Aristotle]] as having defined a general basis for systems in their static-logical states and trying to identify a logic-metalogic for physics, e.g., [[metaphysics]], then homeokinetics is viewed to be an attempt to define the dynamics of all those systems in the universe.

==Flatland physics vs Homeokinetic physics==

Ordinary physics is a flatland physics, a physics at some particular level. Examples include nuclear and atomic physics, biophysics, social physics, and stellar physics. Homeokinetic physics combines flatland physics with the study of the up down processes that binds the levels.&lt;ref name="primer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeokinetics.org/pdf%20files/HomeokineticsPrimer.pdf|title=Primer on Homeokinetics: A Physical Foundation for Complex Systems|author=Arthur Iberall and Harry Soodak|publisher=Cri-de-Coeur Press|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tools, such as mechanics, quantum field theory, and the laws of thermodynamics, provide key relationships for the binding of the levels, how they connect, and how the energy flows up and down. And whether the atomisms are atoms, molecules, cells, people, stars, galaxies, or universes, the same tools can be used to understand them. Homeokinetics treats all complex systems on an equal footing, animate and inanimate, providing them with a common viewpoint. The complexity in studying how they work is reduced by the emergence of common languages in all complex systems.

==Applications==
A homeokinetic approach to complex systems has been applied to ecological psychology,&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A., A physical (homeokinetic) foundation for the Gibsonian theory of perception and action, Ecolog. Psychol. 7(1): 37-68, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; anthropology, geology,

It has also been applied to [[social physics]] where a homeokinetics analysis shows that one must account for flow variables such as the flow of energy, of materials, of action, reproduction rate, and value-in-exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A.S., H.

'''Hotspot Ecosystem Research and Man's Impact On European Seas''' ('''HERMIONE''') is an international multidisciplinary project, started in April 2009, that studies deep-sea [[ecosystems]].&lt;ref name=hermione&gt;[http://www.eu-hermione.net/ '''HERMIONE''' website, http://www.eu-hermione.net/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=weaver1&gt;Weaver et al. (2009). [http://www.eu-hermione.net/images/content/documents/publications/weaver_etal_2009.pdf "The future of integrated deep-sea research in Europe: The HERMIONE project".] ''Oceanography'' 22 (1), March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  HERMIONE scientists study the distribution of [[biodiversity hotspot|hotspot]] ecosystems, how they function and how they interconnect, partially in the context of how these ecosystems are being affected by [[climate change]]&lt;ref name=schloesser1&gt;Schloesser, Manfred (2009). [http://www.innovations-report.de/html/berichte/geowissenschaften/european_deep_sea_research_climate_deep_sea_141988.html European deep-sea research: Climate changes and deep-sea ecosystems in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea.] ''Innovations Report'' (website).&lt;/ref&gt; and impacted by humans through [[overfishing]], resource extraction, seabed installations and [[marine pollution|pollution]].  Major aims of the project are to understand how humans are affecting the deep-sea environment and to provide policy makers with accurate scientific information, enabling effective management strategies to protect deep sea ecosystems.The HERMIONE project is funded by the [[European Commission]]'s [[Seventh Framework Programme]], and is the successor to the [[HERMES project]], which concluded in March 2009.&lt;ref name=hermes&gt;[http://www.eu-hermes.net/ '''HERMES''' website, http://www.eu-hermes.net/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
Europe's deep-ocean margin, from the [[Arctic]] to the [[Iberian Margin]], and across the [[Mediterranean]] to the [[Black Sea]],  spans a distance of over 15,000&amp;nbsp;km and hosts a number of diverse habitats and ecosystems. [[Deep water coral]] reefs, [[undersea mountains]] populated by a multitude of organisms, vast [[submarine canyon]] systems, and [[hydrothermal vent]]s are some of the features contained therein.&lt;ref name=schloesser2&gt;Schloesser, Manfred (2009). [http://www.innovations-report.de/html/berichte/geowissenschaften/ausbrueche_tiefsee_schlammvulkans_haakon_mosby_135655.html Ausbrüche des Tiefsee-Schlammvulkans Haakon Mosby] ("Outbreaks of the Deep Sea Mud Volcano Haakon Mosby"). ''Innovations Report'' (website).&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional view of the deep-sea realm as a hostile and barren place was discredited long ago, and scientists now know that much of Europe's deep sea is rich and diverse.&lt;ref name=marum1&gt;Marum - Zentrum für Marine Umweltwissenschaften an der Universität Bremen (2009). [http://portal.gmx.net/de/themen/wissen/tiere/8563192-Methusalem-Austern-leben-doch-noch.html Erstmals lebende Tiefseeaustern im Mittelmeer entdeckt!] ("For the First Time, Living Deep Sea Oysters Discovered in the Mediterranean!"). ''GMX'' (website).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the deep sea is increasingly threatened by humans: most of this deep-ocean frontier lies within Europe's [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ) and has significant potential for the exploitation of biological, energy, and mineral resources. Research and exploration over the last two decades has shown clear signs of direct and indirect [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic impacts]] in the deep sea, resulting from such activities as [[overfishing]],&lt;ref name=bailey1&gt;Bailey et al. (2009). [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/03/06/rspb.2009.0098.full.pdf "Long-term changes in deep-water fish populations in the northeast Atlantic: a deeper reaching effect of fisheries?".] ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B'' 10.1098/rspb.2009.0098.&lt;/ref&gt; [[marine debris|littering]] and [[marine pollution|pollution]]. This raises concerns because deep-sea processes and ecosystems are not only important for the marine [[food chain|web of life]], but also fundamentally contribute to the global [[biogeochemical cycle]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Continuing with the knowledge obtained by the HERMES project (EC FP6), which contributed significantly to our understanding of deep-sea ecosystems,&lt;ref name=ocean1&gt;See for instance [http://www.tos.org/oceanography/issues/issue_archive/22_1.html the March 2009 issue of ''Oceanography''], dedicated to HERMES, with 16 articles on its contributions. (PDFs viewable at website.)&lt;/ref&gt; the HERMIONE project investigates ecosystems at critical sites on Europe's deep-ocean margin, aiming to make major advances in knowledge of their distribution and functioning, and their contribution to ecosystem goods and services.{{Clarify|date=December 2009}} HERMIONE places special emphasis on human impact on the deep sea and on the translation of scientific information into science policy for the sustainable use of marine resources. To design and implement effective governance strategies and management plans to protect our deep seas for the future, understanding the extent, natural dynamics and interconnection of ocean ecosystems, and integrating socio-economic research with natural science, are important. To achieve this, HERMIONE uses a highly interdisciplinary and integrated approach, engaging experts in [[biology]], [[ecology]], [[biodiversity]], [[oceanography]], [[geology]], [[sedimentology]], [[geophysics]] and [[biogeochemistry]], who will work alongside socio-economists and policy-makers.

== Hotspot research ==
The HERMIONE project focuses on deep-sea "hotspot" ecosystems including [[submarine canyon]]s, open slopes and deep basins, [[chemosynthetic]] environments, deep water coral reefs, and [[seamount]]s.  Hotspot ecosystems support high species diversity, numbers of individuals, or both, and are therefore important in maintaining margin-wide biodiversity and abundance.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  HERMIONE research ranges from investigation of the ecosystems' dimensions, distribution, interconnection and functioning, to understanding the potential impacts of [[climate change]] and anthropogenic disturbance. The ultimate objective is to provide stakeholders and policymakers with the scientific knowledge necessary to support deep-sea governance, sustainable management and conservation of these ecosystems.

To obtain the data needed, HERMIONE scientists are spending over 1000 days at sea, using more than 50 research vessels across Europe.  Sharing vessels and equipment between partners will bring benefits through shared knowledge, expertise and data, and will also maximise the research effort, increasing efficiency and productivity. State-of-the-art technology will be used, with [[remotely operated underwater vehicle|Remotely Operated Vehicles]] (ROVs) one of the critical pieces of equipment being used for a wide range of delicate manoeuvres and high-resolution surveys, from precision sampling of methane gas at [[cold seep]]s to [[bathymetry|microbathymetry]] mapping to examine the structure of the seabed.  Large arrays of [[mooring (oceanography)|instrumented moorings]], shared by different partner institutions, will be deployed in common experimental areas, allowing HERMIONE to develop experimental strategies beyond any national capacity.

=== Study areas ===
[[Image:Map of research areas.jpg|thumb|alt=map of HERMIONE scientific study areas|Map of HERMIONE areas of scientific research]]

The HERMIONE study sites were selected on the following basis:

*The Arctic because of its importance in monitoring climate change;
*Nordic margin with abundant cold-water corals, extensive [[hydrocarbon exploration]] and the Haakon-Mosby mud volcano (HMMV) natural laboratory;
*Celtic margin with a mid-latitude canyon, cold water corals and the long term [[Porcupine Abyssal Plain]] (PAP) monitoring site;
*Portuguese margin with the highly diverse [[Nazaré Canyon|Nazare]] and [[Setubal canyon]]s;
*Seamounts in the Atlantic and western Mediterranean as important biodiversity hotspots potentially under threat;
*[[Mid-Atlantic Ridge|Mid Atlantic Ridge]] (MAR) [[ESONET]] site to link [[cold seep]] to [[hydrothermal vent|hot seep]] chemosynthetic studies;
*Mediterranean cold water cascading sites in the Gulf of Lions and outflows of the Adriatic and Aegean Seas.

The HMMV, PAP, MAR and central Mediterranean sites link to the ESONET long-term monitoring sites and will provide valuable background information.

=== Cold-water coral reefs ===
Deep water coral reefs are found along the northeast Atlantic and central Mediterranean margins, and are important [[biodiversity hotspot]]s.&lt;ref name=oevelen1&gt;van Oevelen et al. (2009).

There are several known coral hotspot areas on Europe's deep-ocean margin, including the Scandinavian, [[Rockall Bank and Trough|Rockall-Porcupine]] and central Mediterranean margins, and there remain many questions about them, such as how each of the sites are connected to one another,&lt;ref name=henry2&gt;Henry et al.

HERMIONE scientists use cutting-edge technology to try to answer these questions.&lt;ref name=weaver1 /&gt;  High-resolution mapping of the seafloor will be carried out to determine the location and distribution of cold-water corals, and photographic observations will be made to assess changes in the status of known reefs over time, such as their response to climatic variation or their recovery from destruction by fishing trawlers.  To assess biodiversity and its relationship with environmental factors such as climate change, [[DNA barcoding]] and other molecular techniques will be used.

=== Submarine canyons ===
Submarine canyons are deep, steep-sided valleys that form on continental margins.  Stretching from the shelf to the deep sea, they dissect much of the European margin.  They are one of the most complex seascapes known to humans; their rugged topography and challenging environmental conditions mean that they are also one of the least explored.  Advances in technology over the last two decades have allowed scientists to uncover some of the mysteries of canyons, the size of which often rival the [[Grand Canyon]],&lt;ref&gt;Tyler et al. (2009). [http://www.tos.org/oceanography/issues/issue_archive/22_1.html "Europe's Grand Canyon"] ''Oceanography'' 22 (1), March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; USA.

One of the most important discoveries is that canyons are major sources and sinks for sediment and organic matter on continental margins.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard et al. (1979). "Currents in submarine canyons and other seavalleys" ''AAPG Studies in Geology'' (8), Tulsa, OK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carson et al.

Particle flux through canyons has been found to be between two and four times greater than on the open slope,&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; though the transfer of particles through canyons is thought to be largely "event-driven",&lt;ref&gt;Palanques et al.

Determining what drives sediment transport and deposition within canyons is one of the major challenges for HERMIONE.

The capacity of canyons to focus and concentrate organic matter can promote high abundances and diversity of fauna.  However, variability in environmental conditions and topography is very high, both within and between canyons, and this is reflected in the variability of the structure and dynamics of the biological communities.&lt;ref&gt;Pattenden (2009) "The influence of submarine canyons on the structure and dynamics of megafauna communities" ''PhD Thesis'', University of Southampton&lt;/ref&gt;  Our understanding of biological processes in canyons has greatly improved with the use of submersibles and ROVs, but this research has also revealed that the relationships between fauna and canyons are more complex than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia et al. (2007).

(in prep.) "Megafauna community composition in two contrasting submarine canyons"&lt;/ref&gt;  The diversity of submarine canyons and their fauna means that it is difficult to make generalisations that can be used to create policies for canyon ecosystem management.  It is important that the role of canyons in maintaining biodiversity, and how potential anthropogenic impacts may affect this,&lt;ref&gt;Richter et al. (2009). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VGB-4TKPVB1-2&amp;_user=126770&amp;_coverDate=02%2F28%2F2009&amp;_rdoc=9&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=doc-info(%23toc%236034%232009%23999439997%23826056%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&amp;_cdi=6034&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_ct=10&amp;_acct=C000010399&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=126770&amp;md5=047059f8e6dd27fc27c3140431ce2510 "Dispersal of natural and anthropogenic lead through submarine canyons at the Portuguese margin"] ''Deep-Sea Research Part I'' 56, February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin et al.

HERMIONE will address this challenge by examining canyon ecosystems from different biogeochemical provinces and topographic settings, in light of the complex interactions among habitat (topography, water masses, currents), mass and energy transfer, and biological communities.

=== Open slopes and deep basins ===
Open slopes and deep basins make up &gt; 90% of the ocean floor and 65% of the Earth's surface, and many of the goods and services provided by the deep sea (e.g., oil, gas, climate regulation and food) are produced and stored by them.  They are intricately involved in global biogeochemical and ecological processes, and so are essential for the functioning of our biosphere and human wellbeing.

Recent research in the HERMES (EC-FP6) project gathered a large body of information on local biodiversity at large scales, different latitudes and in different hotspot ecosystems, but the research also highlighted the high degree of complexity of deep-sea habitats.  This information is fundamental to our understanding of the factors that control biodiversity at much larger scales, from hundreds to thousands of kilometres.  HERMIONE will conduct further studies on the mosaic of habitats found in deep-sea slopes and basins, and will investigate the relationships within and between these habitats, their biodiversity and ecology, and their interconnection with other hotspot ecosystems.

Investigating the impacts of anthropogenic activities and climate change in the deep sea is a theme that runs through all HERMIONE research.  To the biological communities on open slopes and in deep basins, seafloor warming through climate change is a major threat.  Up to 85% of methane reservoirs along the continental margin could be destabilised, which would not only release climate-warming methane gas into the atmosphere, but would also have unknown and potentially devastating consequences on benthic communities.  The role of climatic variation on deep-sea benthos is not well understood, although large-scale changes in the structure of seafloor communities have been observed over the last two decades.  The use of long-term, deep-sea observatories, e.g., the Hausgarten deep-sea observatory in the Arctic and the time-series analysis of the Catalan margin and Southern Adriatic Sea, will help HERMIONE scientists to examine recent changes in benthic communities, and to study decadal variability in physical processes, such as the dense shelf water cascading events in submarine canyons.&lt;ref name="Flushing submarine canyons"/&gt;

HERMIONE aims to provide quantitative estimates of the potential consequences of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning, to examine how deep-sea benthos adapt to large-scale changes, and, for the first time, to create conceptual models integrating deep-sea biodiversity and quantitative analyses of ecosystem functioning and processes.

=== Seamounts ===
Seamounts are underwater mountains that rise from the depths of the ocean, and whose summits can sometimes be found just a few hundred metres below the sea surface.  To be classified as a seamount the summit must be 1000 m higher than the surrounding seafloor,&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, P. (2007) "Seamount characteristics" p. 3-25 in ''Seamounts: Ecology, Fisheries and Conservation.'' T.J. Pitcher, T. Morato, P.J.B. Hart, M.R. Clark, N. Haggan, and R.S. Santos (eds), ''Fish and Aquatic Resource Series'', Blackwell, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; and under this definition there are an estimated 1000–2800 seamounts in the Atlantic Ocean and around 60 in the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Kitchingman, A., Lai, S., Morato, T., and Pauly, D. (2007). "How many seamounts are there and where are they located?" p.26-40 in ''Seamounts: Ecology, Fisheries and Conservation.'' T.J. Pitcher, T. Morato, P.J.B. Hart, M.R. Clark, N. Haggan, and R.S. Santos (eds), ''Fish and Aquatic Resource Series'', Blackwell, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seamounts enhance water flow through localised tides, eddies, and upwelling, and these physical processes may enhance primary production.&lt;ref&gt;White, M., Bashmachnikov, I., Aristegui, H., and Martins, A. (2007). "Physical processes and seamount productivity" p.65-84 in ''Seamounts: Ecology, Fisheries and Conservation.'' T.J. Pitcher, T. Morato, P.J.B. Hart, M.R. Clark, N. Haggan, and R.S. Santos (eds), ''Fish and Aquatic Resource Series'', Blackwell, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;  Seamounts may therefore be considered as hotspots of marine life; fauna benefit from the enhanced hydrodynamics and phytoplankton supply, and thrive on the slopes and summits.  Suspension feeders, such as gorgonian sea fans and the cold-water corals like Lophelia pertusa, often dominate the rich benthic (seafloor-dwelling) communities.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, A., Baco, A., Griffiths, H., Hart, T., and Hall-Spencer, J.M. (2007). "Corals on seamounts" p.141-169 in ''Seamounts: Ecology, Fisheries and Conservation.'' T.J. Pitcher, T. Morato, P.J.B. Hart, M.R. Clark, N. Haggan, and R.S. Santos (eds), ''Fish and Aquatic Resource Series'', Blackwell, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; The enhanced abundance and diversity of fauna is not limited to benthic species, as fish are known to aggregate over seamounts.&lt;ref&gt;Morato, T. and Clark, M.R. (2007). "Seamount fishes: Ecology and life histories" p.170-188 in ''Seamounts: Ecology, Fisheries and Conservation.'' T.J. Pitcher, T. Morato, P.J.B. Hart, M.R. Clark, N. Haggan, and R.S. Santos (eds), ''Fish and Aquatic Resource Series'', Blackwell, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, this knowledge has led to increasing commercial exploitation of seamount fish by the fishing industry, and a number of seamount fish populations have already been depleted.  Part of HERMIONE research will assess the threats and impacts of human activities on seamounts, including comparing data from seamounts in different stages of fisheries exploitation to understand more about the impacts of fishing activities., both on target species and non-target species, and their habitats.

Despite our increasing knowledge on seamounts, there is still very little known about the relationships between their ecosystem functioning and biodiversity, and that of the surrounding areas.  This information is vital in order to improve our understanding of connectivity between seamount hotspots and adjacent areas, and HERMIONE research will aim to discover whether seamounts act as centres of speciation (the evolution of new species), or if they play a role as "stepping stones", allowing fauna to colonise and disperse across the oceans.

=== Chemosynthetic ecosystems ===
Chemosynthetic environments - such as hot vents, cold seeps, mud volcanoes and sulphidic brine pools - show the highest biomass and productivity of all deep-sea ecosystems.  The chemicals found in the fluids, gases and mud that escape from such systems provide an energy source for chemosynthetic bacteria and archaea, which are the primary producers in these systems. A huge variety of fauna profits from the association with chemosynthetic microbes, supporting large communities that can exist independently of sunlight.  Some of these environments, such as methane (cold) seeps, can support up to 50,000 times more biomass than communities that rely on photosynthetic production alone.&lt;ref&gt;Sibuet, M. and Olu-Le Roy, K. (2002)"Cold seep communities on continental margins: Structure and quantitative distribution relative to geological and fluid venting patterns". Pp. 235-251 in ''Ocean Margin Systems'' Wefer, G., Billett, D.S.M., Hebbeln, D., Jorgensen, B.B., Schluter, M. and Van Weering, T.C.M. (eds), Springer Verlag, Berlin&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the extreme gradients and diversity in physical and chemical factors, hydrothermal vents also remain incredibly fascinating ecosystems. HERMIONE researchers aim to illustrate the tight coupling between geosphere and biosphere processes, as well as their immense heterogeneity and interconnectivity, by observing and comparing the spatial and temporal variation of chemosynthetic environments in European Sea’s.

Methane cycling and carbonate formation by microorganisms in chemosynthetic environments have implications for the control of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;Boetius, A. et al. (2007) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v407/n6804/full/407623a0.html "A marine microbial consortium apparently mediating anaerobic oxidation of methane"] ''Nature'' 407, p.623-626, August 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, R.J. et al. (2007) "Biogeochemistry and biodiversity of methane cycling in subsurface marine sediments (Skagerrak, Denmark)" ''Environmental Microbiology'', 9, p.1146-1161&lt;/ref&gt;  Methane can be trapped and stored under the seabed as a gas hydrate, and under different conditions, can either be controlled by microbial consumption, or can escape into the surrounding seawater, and ultimately the atmosphere. Our understanding of the biological controls of methane seepage and feedback mechanisms for global warming is limited. The distribution and structure of cold seep communities can act as an indicator for changes in methane fluxes in the deep sea, e.g. by seafloor warming.&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;Niemann H. et al.(2006) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7113/full/nature05227.html "Novel microbial communities of the Haakon Mosby mud volcano and their role as a methane sink"] ''Nature'' 443, p.854-858, August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Using multibeam echosounder data and 3D seismic data with in situ studies at seep sites, and by investigating the life histories of fauna at such ecosystems, HERMIONE scientists aim to understand more about their interconnectivity and resilience, and the implications for climate change.

The great variety of fauna present in chemosynthetic environments is a real challenge to scientists.  Only a tiny fraction of microorganisms at vents and seeps has been identified, and a huge amount is still to be discovered. Their identification, their association with fauna, and the relationship between their diversity, function and habitat, are vital areas of research as biological communities act as important filters, controlling up to 100% of vent and seep emissions.&lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt;  By using DNA barcoding and genome analysis in addition to traditional methods of identification and experimentation, HERMIONE scientists will study the relationship between community structure and ecosystem functioning at a variety of vents, seeps, brine pools and mud volcanoes.

== Socio-economics, governance and science-policy interfaces ==
With increasing ocean exploration over the last two decades has come the realisation that humans have had an extensive impact on the world’s oceans, not just close to our shores, but also reaching down into the deep sea.  From destructive fishing practices and exploitation of mineral resources to pollution and litter, evidence of human impact can be found in virtually all deep-sea ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, D.M., Collins, M.A., Gordon, J.D.M., Zuur, A.F., and Priede, I.G. (2009) [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1664/1965.full.pdf "Long-term changes in deep-water fish populations in the northeast Atlantic: a deeper reaching effect of fisheries?"]''Proceedings of the Royal Society B'' {{doi|10.1098/rspb.2009.0098}}, March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galil, B.S., Golik, A., and Turkay, M. (1995) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V6N-3YMFRG6-3S&amp;_user=126770&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1158904856&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000010399&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=126770&amp;md5=40971b16522441babb3c3589be3dcb8b "Litter at the bottom of the sea: A sea bed survey in the Eastern Mediterranean"] ''Marine Pollution Bulletin'' 30, p22-24, January 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, the international community has set a series of ambitious goals aimed at protecting the marine environment and its resources for future generations.  Three of these initiatives, decided on by world leaders during the [[Earth Summit 2002|2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (Johannesburg), are to achieve a significant reduction in biodiversity loss by 2010, to introduce an ecosystems approach to marine resource assessment and management by 2010, and to designate a network of [[marine protected area]]s by 2012.  A crucial requirement for implementing these is the availability of high-quality scientific data and knowledge, as well as effective [[science policy|science-policy]] interfaces to ensure the policy relevance of research and to enable the rapid translation of scientific information into science policy.

HERMIONE aims to provide this by filling the knowledge gap about threatened deep-sea ecosystems and their current status with respect to anthropogenic impacts (e.g. litter, chemical contamination).  Socio-economists and natural scientists work together in HERMIONE, researching the socio-economics of anthropogenic impacts, mapping human activities that affect the deep sea, assessing the potential for valuing deep-sea ecosystem goods and services, studying governance options and designing and implementing real-time science-policy interfaces.

HERMIONE natural and social science results will provide national, regional (EU), and global policy-makers and other stakeholders with the information needed to establish policies to ensure the sustainable use of the deep ocean and conservation of deep-sea ecosystems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15683">'''Interactive machine translation''' ('''IMT'''), is a specific sub-field of [[computer-aided translation]]. Under this [[translation]] paradigm, the [[computer software]] that assists the human translator attempts to predict the text the user is going to input by taking into account all the information it has available. Whenever such prediction is wrong and the user provides [[feedback]] to the system, a new prediction is performed considering the new information available. Such process is repeated until the translation provided matches the  user's expectations.

Interactive machine translation is specially interesting when [[translation|translating]] texts in domains where it is not admissible to output a translation containing errors, hence requiring a human user to amend the translations provided by the system.  In such cases, interactive machine translation has been proved to provide benefit to potential users.&lt;ref name="Casacuberta 2009"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, there are few [[commercial software]] that implements interactive machine translation and work done in the field is mostly restrained to [[academic research]].

== History ==

Historically, interactive machine translation is born as an evolution of the [[computer-aided translation]] paradigm, where the human translator and the machine translation system were intended to work as a [[tandem]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Foster |first1=George |last2=Isabelle |first2=Pierre |last3=Plamondon |first3=Pierre
               |year=1997 |title=Target-text mediated interactive machine translation
               |journal=Machine Translation |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=175–194

&lt;/ref&gt;
This first work was extended within the TransType research project, funded by the Canadian government. In this project, the [[Human–computer interaction|human interaction]] was aimed towards producing the target text for the first time by embedding data-driven [[machine translation]] techniques within the interactive translation environment with the goal of achieving the best of both actors: the efficiency of the automatic system and the reliability of human translators.

Later, a larger-scale research project, TransType2,&lt;ref name="Casacuberta 2009" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="Barrachina 2009" /&gt; funded by the [[European Commission]] extended such work by analyzing the incorporation of a complete  [[machine translation system]] into the process, with the goal of producing a complete translation hypothesis, which the human user is allowed to amend or accept. If the user decides to amend the hypothesis, the system then attempts to make the best use of such [[feedback]] in order to produce a new translation hypothesis that takes into account the modifications introduced by the user.

&lt;/ref&gt; also funded by the [[European Commission]], aimed at developing novel types of assistance to human translators and integrated them into a new workbench, consisting of an editor, a server, and analysis and visualisation tools. The workbench was designed in a modular fashion and can be combined with existing computer aided translation tools. Furthermore, the CASMACAT workbench can learn from the interaction with the human translator by updating and adapting its models instantly based on the translation choices of the user.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; revealed the fact that interactive machine translation may even be used by users that do not speak the source language in order to achieve near professional translation quality. Moreover, it also elucidated the fact that an interactive scenario is more beneficial than a classic post-edition scenario.

The previously described approaches rely on a tightly coupled underlying corpus-based machine translation system (usually, a [[Statistical machine translation]] system) that is used as a [[White_box_(software_engineering)|glass box]], therefore inheriting the [[Statistical machine translation#Shortcomings|shortcomings of the translation systems]] and limiting the usage of interactive machine translation for some scenarios. For this reason, an approach that uses any kind of bilingual resource (not limited to machine translation) as a [[black-box]] to provide interactive machine translation was developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W14-0309

      |booktitle=Proceedings of the EACL 2014 Workshop on Humans and Computer-assisted Translation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is not able to extract as much information from the bilingual resources used, due to the black-box nature of the interaction, but can use any resource available to the user. Forecat is a black-box interactive machine translation implementation that is available both as a web application (that includes a webpage and a web services interface) and as a plugin for [[OmegaT]] (Forecat-OmegaT).

== Process ==

The interactive machine translation process starts with the system suggesting a
translation hypothesis to the user. Then, the user may accept the complete
sentence as correct, or may modify it if he considers there is some error.
Typically, when modifying a given word, it is assumed that the prefix until
that word is correct, leading to a left-to-right interaction scheme. Once the
user has changed the word considered incorrect, the system then proposes a new
suffix, i.e. the remainder of the sentence. Such process continues until the
translation provided satisfies the user.

Although explained at the word level, the previous process may also be implemented at the character level, and hence the system provides a suffix whenever the human translator types in a single character. In addition, there is ongoing effort towards changing the typical left-to-right interaction scheme in order to make [[human-machine interaction]] easier.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar approach is used in the [[Caitra]] translation tool.

== Evaluation ==

Evaluation is a difficult issue in interactive machine translation. Ideally,
evaluation should take place in experiments involving human users. However,
given the high monetary cost this would imply, this is seldom the case.
Moreover, even when considering human translators in order to perform a true
evaluation of interactive machine translation techniques, it is not clear what
should be measured in such experiments, since there are many different
variables that should be taken into account and cannot be controlled, as is 
for instance the time the user takes in order to get used to the process.
In the CASMACAT project, some field trials have been carried out to study some of these variables.&lt;ref&gt;

For quick evaluations in laboratory conditions, interactive machine translation is measured by using the ''key stroke ratio'' or the ''word stroke ratio''. Such criteria attempt to measure how many key-strokes  or words did the user need to introduce before producing the final translated  document.&lt;ref name="Barrachina 2009" /&gt;

== Differences with classical computer-aided translation ==
Although interactive machine translation is a sub-field of [[computer-aided translation]], the main attractive of the former with respect to the latter is the interactivity. In classical computer-aided translation, the translation system may suggest one translation hypothesis in the best case, and then the user is required to [[postediting|post-edit]] such hypothesis. In contrast, in interactive machine translation the system produces a new translation hypothesis each time the user interacts with the system, i.e. after each word (or letter) has been introduced.

[[Image:Jog Dial 001.jpg|thumb|Jog Dial by [[Sony Ericsson]]]]

A '''jog dial''', '''jog wheel''', '''shuttle dial''', or '''shuttle wheel''' is a type of knob, ring, wheel, or dial which allows the user to shuttle or jog through [[music|audio]] or [[video]] media.  It is commonly found on models of [[CD player]]s which are made for [[disc jockey]]s, and on professional video equipment such as [[video tape recorder]]s.  More recently, they are found on [[handheld]] [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, and as the [[scroll wheel]] on [[Mouse (computing)|computer mice]].  "Jog" refers to going at a very slow speed, whereas "shuttle" refers to a very fast speed.

There are two basic types of wheels.  One type has no stops and can be spun the entire way around, because it is a relative [[rotary encoder]].  This type depends on tracking the actual motion of the dial: the faster it spins forward or back, the faster it fast-forwards or rewinds.  Once the dial stops moving, the media continues playing or remains paused at that point.   Another type has stops on either side, and often has three or so speeds which depend on how far it is turned.  Once the wheel is released, it [[spring (device)|spring]]s back to the middle position and the media pauses or begins playing again.

If the device is set or designed to pause after the wheel is used, the audio is often [[stutter]]ed, repeating a small section over and over again.  This is usually done on DJ CD players, for the purpose of [[beatmatching]], and is equivalent to an earlier [[turntablist]] DJ moving a [[phonograph]] record back and forth slightly to find the physical location of a starting [[beat (music)|beat]] within the groove.  On video, the pause is a freeze frame of the current [[video frame]].

[[Sony Corporation]] holds a patent for a 5-way version of jog dial. A 5-way jog dial allows up and down scrolling, right and left deflections, and a press-to-click action. Such jog dial was a feature of Sony [[CLIÉ]] [[PDA]] series and [[SonyEricsson]] [[P800]], [[Sony Ericsson P900|P900]] and [[P910]] smartphones. A 5-way jog dial has not been used by Sony or its subsidiaries since 2006.

Dr. Ward joined the cryptologic service during WWII and worked for the Signal Security Agency (the Army's cryptologic organization). She also worked as a librarian and eventually built a collection of classified and unclassified materials for use by analysts. In 1945 she became the deputy chief of the reference section. Within a few years, she turned the section into one that was known as poorly organized, into a section that was widely recognized and highly respected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vFYRDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT430&amp;lpg=PT430&amp;dq=Julia+Ward+NSA&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5XAGS2slBJ&amp;sig=kKUze03HNpORwObn2MZbXMAUbls&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjyxI6w3evcAhWPFXwKHa06BP84ChDoATAEegQIBhAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Julia%20Ward%20&amp;f=false|title=Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II|last=Mundy|first=Liza|date=2017-10-10|publisher=Hachette Books|isbn=9780316352550|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1949, Dr. Ward was named head of the Collateral Branch, thereby becoming the only female branch head in the Office of Operations. 

Later, in 1955 Dr. Ward, was promoted to deputy chief of NSA's Liaison and Foreign Operations Section.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6838">In [[signal processing]], '''Lulu [[smoothing]]''' is a [[nonlinear]] mathematical technique for removing impulsive [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]] from a data sequence such as a [[time series]]. It is a nonlinear equivalent to taking a [[moving average]] (or other smoothing technique) of a time series, and is similar to other [[nonlinear smoothing]] techniques, such as Tukey&lt;ref name="Tukey" /&gt; or [[Median filter|median smoothing]].[[File:LUSmoother width=1.png|thumb|LU smoother of width 1 applied to a noisy sequence]] LULU smoothers are compared in detail to median smoothers by Jankowitz&lt;ref name="jankowitz2007some" /&gt; and found to be superior in some aspects, particularly in mathematical properties like [[idempotence]].

== Properties ==
Lulu operators have a  number of attractive mathematical properties, among them [[idempotence]] – meaning that repeated application of the operator yields the same result as a single application – and co-idempotence. 
An interpretation of idempotence is that: 'Idempotence means that there is no “noise” left in the smoothed data and co-idempotence means that there is no “signal” left in the residual.'&lt;ref name="conradie2006exact" /&gt;

When studying smoothers there are four properties that are useful to optimize:&lt;ref name="rohwer2005nonlinear" /&gt;

# Effectiveness
# Consistency
# Stability
# Efficiency

The operators can also be used to decompose a signal into various subcomponents&lt;ref name="fabris2009lulu" /&gt; similar to wavelet or Fourier decomposition.

== History ==
Lulu smoothers were discovered  by C. H. Rohwer&lt;ref name="Rohwer1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohwer" /&gt; and have been studied for the last 30 years. Their exact and asymptotic distributions have been derived.&lt;ref name="conradie2006exact" /&gt;

== Operation ==
Applying a Lulu smoother consists of repeated applications of the min and max operators over a given subinterval of the data.
As with other smoothers, a width or interval must be specified. The Lulu smoothers are composed of repeated applications of the ''L'' (lower) and ''U'' (Upper) operators, which are defined as follows:

=== L operator ===
For an L operator of width ''n'' over an infinite sequence of ''x''s (..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+1&lt;/sub&gt;,...), the operation on ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is calculated as follows:

# Firstly we create (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) mini-sequences of length (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) each.  Each of these mini-sequences contains the element ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, for width 1, we create 2 mini-sequences of length 2 each. For width 1 these mini sequences are (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+1&lt;/sub&gt;). For width 2, the mini-sequences are (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;), (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+2&lt;/sub&gt;). For width 2, we refer to these mini-sequences as seq&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;, seq&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and seq&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt;
# Then we take the minimum of each of the mini sequences. Again for width 2 this gives: (Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;), Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt;)). This gives us (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) numbers for each point.
# Lastly we take the maximum of (the minimums of the mini sequences), or Max(Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;), Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt;)) and this becomes ''L''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;)

Thus for width 2, the ''L'' operator is:

: ''L''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) =  Max(Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;), Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), Min(seq&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt;))

=== U Operator ===
This is identical to  the L operator, except that the order of Min and Max is reversed, i.e. for width 2:

: ''U''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) =  Min(Max(seq&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;), Max(seq&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), Max(seq&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt;))

=== Examples ===
Examples of the ''U'' and ''L'' operators, as well as combined ''UL'' and ''LU'' operators on a sample data set are shown in the following figures.

[[File:LSmoother width=1.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|L Smoother width 1]]
[[File:USmoother width=1.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|U Smoother width 1]]

It can be seen that the results of the ''UL'' and ''LU'' operators can be different. The combined operators are very effective at removing impulsive noise, the only cases where the noise is not removed effectively is where we get multiple noise signals very close together, in which case the filter 'sees' the multiple noises as part of the signal.

A '''luminous flame''' is a burning [[flame]] which is brightly visible. Much of its output is in the form of [[visible light]], as well as heat or light in the non-visible wavelengths.

An early study of flame luminosity was conducted by [[Michael Faraday]] and became part of his series of [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]], ''[[The Chemical History of a Candle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Luminosity ==
[[File:Fire dancer.JPG|thumb|Circus [[fire art]]s rely on a brightly luminous flame, ideally with minimal heat output]]
In the simplest case, the yellow flame is [[luminosity|luminous]] due to small [[soot]] particles in the flame which are heated to [[incandescence]]. Producing a deliberately luminous flame requires either a shortage of combustion air (as in a [[Bunsen burner]]) or a local excess of fuel (as for a [[kerosene]] torch).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Because of this dependency upon relatively inefficient combustion, luminosity is associated with [[diffusion flame]]s and is lessened with [[premixed flame]]s.

The flame is yellow because of its temperature. To produce enough soot to be luminous, the flame is operated at a lower temperature than its efficient heating flame (see [[#Bunsen burner|Bunsen burner]]). The colour of simple incandescence is due to [[black-body radiation]]. By [[Planck's law]], as the temperature decreases, the peak of the black-body radiation curve moves to longer wavelengths, i.e. from the blue to the yellow. However, the blue light from a gas burner's premixed flame is primarily a product of molecular emission (Swan bands) rather than black-body radiation.

Other factors, particularly the fuel chemistry and its propensity for forming soot, have an influence on luminosity.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The Victorian chemist, [[Edward Frankland#Scientific work|Edward Frankland]], studied luminosity in flames and discovered that their luminosity also increased with [[pressure]].

== Bunsen burner ==
[[File:Bunsen_burner_flame_types.jpg|thumb|A variety of [[Bunsen burner]] flames. Bunsen burners may be adjusted from a highly luminous flame (left) to a hotter 'roaring blue flame' (right)]]
One of the most familiar instances of a luminous flame is produced by a [[Bunsen burner]]. This burner has a controllable air supply and a constant gas jet: when the air supply is reduced, a highly luminous, and thus visible, orange 'safety flame' is produced. For heating work, the air inlet is opened and the burner produces a much hotter blue flame.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Combustion efficiency ==
Efficient combustion relies on the complete combustion of the fuel. Production of [[soot]] represents a waste of fuel (the soot could have been burned further) and may also be a problem for its build-up around jets and burners. Heating burners are thus usually designed to produce a ''non-''luminous flame.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Oil lamps ==
Lamps for illumination rather than heat may use a deliberately luminous flame. A more efficient method overall uses a [[gas mantle|mantle]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/munwai/history.htm A Brief History of the Incandescent Mantle Pressure Lamp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050703081357/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/munwai/history.htm |date=2005-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the incandescent soot in a luminous flame, the mantle is heated and then glows. The flame does not provide much light itself, and so a more heat-efficient non-luminous flame is preferred. Unlike simple soot, a mantle uses [[rare-earth element]]s to provide a bright white glow; the colour of the glow comes from the [[spectral line]]s of these elements, not from simple black-body radiation.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Flame testing ==
When performing a [[flame test]], the colour of a flame is affected by external materials added to it. A non-luminous flame is used, to avoid masking the test colour by the flame's own colour.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

'''Malacidins''' are a class of [[Secondary metabolite|chemicals made by bacteria]] found in soil that can kill [[Gram-positive bacteria]]. Their activity appears to be dependent on [[calcium]]. The discovery of malacidins was published in 2018.&lt;ref name = "Hover_2018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hover BM, Kim SH, Katz M, Charlop-Powers Z, Owen JG, Ternei MA, Maniko J, Estrela AB, Molina H, Park S, Perlin DS, Brady SF | title = Culture-independent discovery of the malacidins as calcium-dependent antibiotics with activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens | journal = Nature Microbiology | volume = 3| issue = 4| pages = 415-422| date = February 2018 | pmid = 29434326 | pmc = 5874163 | doi = 10.1038/s41564-018-0110-1 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The malacidin family were discovered using a new method of soil microbiome screening that does not require cell culturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | volume = 96 | issue = 8 | page = 6 | date = February 19, 2018 | first = Stu | last = Borman | name-list-format = vanc | journal = Chemical &amp; Engineering News | title = Genetic screen of soil microbes uncovers novel antibiotics: Method could help researchers discover new natural products from hard-to-culture microorganisms }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allowed researchers to identify genetic components necessary to produce the chemical.  Malacidin A was shown to kill ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' and other Gram-positive bacteria.

At the time of publication it was not certain if the discovery would lead to any new [[Antibiotics|antibiotic]] drugs, because large investments of time and money are required to determine whether any drug is safe and effective.&lt;ref name="wapost" /&gt;

==Chemical structure==
Malacidins are [[macrocycle]] [[lipopeptide]]s.  The 2018 paper described two chemicals in the malacidin family, differing only by a [[Methylene group|methylene]] at their [[lipid]] tails.&lt;ref name="Hover_2018"/&gt; Their [[peptide]] cores include four [[non-proteinogenic amino acids]].&lt;ref name="Hover_2018"/&gt; The name "malacidin" is derived from the abbreviation of ''metagenomic acidic lipopeptide antibiotic'' and the suffix ''-cidin''.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web | first = Melissa | last = Healy | name-list-format = vanc | url =  http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-new-antibiotic-soil-20180213-story.html | title = In soil-dwelling bacteria, scientists find a new weapon to fight drug-resistant superbugs | date = 13 February 2018 | access-date = 13 February 2018 | website = [[Los Angeles Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
Malacidins appear to take on their active conformation after they bind to calcium; the calcium-bound molecule then appears to bind to [[lipid II]], a bacterial [[cell wall]] precursor molecule, leading to destruction of the cell wall and death of the bacteria.&lt;ref name="Hover_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = King | first1 = Anthony | name-list-format = vanc | title = Soil search unearths new class of antibiotics | url = https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/soil-search-unearths-new-class-of-antibiotics-/3008658.article | work = Chemistry World | date = 14 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, they would be a new member of the class of calcium-dependent antibiotics.&lt;ref name="Hover_2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wapost"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2018/02/13/a-potentially-powerful-new-antibiotic-is-discovered-in-dirt/ | title = A potentially powerful new antibiotic is discovered in dirt | first = Sarah | last = Kaplan | name-list-format = vanc | date = February 13, 2018 | access-date = February 13, 2018 | website = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of malacidins supported the view that the calcium-dependent antibiotics are a larger class than previously thought.&lt;ref name="Hover_2018"/&gt;

==History==
Malacidins were discovered by researchers at [[Rockefeller University]], led by Brad Hover and Sean Brady. The group had been looking into antibiotics related to [[daptomycin]] and their calcium-dependent nature, but determined that it would be impractical to [[Cell culture|culture]] variations in lab conditions.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; Instead, the team used a genetics approach that was more scalable.  They focused on searching for novel biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) – genes that are usually expressed together, that bacteria use to make secondary metabolites. To do this, they extracted DNA from around 2,000 soil samples to build [[metagenomics|metagenomic]] libraries that captured the genetic diversity of the environmental microbiome.  They then designed [[Primer (molecular biology)#Degenerate primers|degenerate primers]] to amplify genes likely to be similar to the BGC that make daptomycin by using a [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) procedure, [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] the amplified genes, and then used [[metagenomics]] to confirm that these genes were indeed likely to be the kind of BGCs they sought. One of the novel BGCs they found was present in around 19% of the screened soil samples but not readily found in cultured microbial collections, so they took that BGC, put it into other host bacteria, and then isolated and analyzed the secondary metabolites.&lt;ref name="Hover_2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; The work was published in ''[[Nature Microbiology]]'' in February 2018.&lt;ref name="Hover_2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/health-43032602 | title = New antibiotic family discovered in dirt | date = 13 February 2018 | access-date = 13 February 2018 | website = [[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research directions==
The approach of screening the soil for useful compounds using genomics has been done by others, and is likely to continue to be pursued as a method to further explore [[primary metabolite]]s and secondary metabolites made by microrganisms.&lt;ref name="wapost"/&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Hotz | first1 = Robert Lee | name-list-format = vanc | title = Scientists Unearth Hope for New Antibiotics | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/genetic-sequencing-unearths-hope-for-new-antibiotics-1518451201 | work=Wall Street Journal | date = 12 February 2018 | access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018|February}}, the malacidins had not been tested on humans. At the time of their discovery it was unknown whether the discovery would lead to any new antibiotic drugs; showing that a potential drug is safe and effective takes years of work and millions of dollars, and the scientists said at the time that they had no plans to try to develop a drug based on the work.&lt;ref name="wapost" /&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt; In the 2018 paper, malacidins were shown to kill only Gram-positive bacteria and not [[Gram-negative bacteria]].&lt;ref name="Hover_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; They were, however, able to kill [[Multiple drug resistance|multidrug-resistant]] pathogens, including bacteria resistant to [[vancomycin]] in the laboratory, and [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) skin infections in an animal wound model.&lt;ref name="Hover_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

Brady, Hover, and two other authors disclosed in the 2018 paper that they had "competing financial interests, as they are employees or consultants of Lodo Therapeutics."&lt;ref name="Hover_2018" /&gt; Lodo was founded in 2016 out of Brady's laboratory, to discover new chemicals in nature as [[Drug_discovery#Nature_as_source|starting points for drug discovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jarvis|first1=Lisa M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Lodo Therapeutics|url=https://cen.acs.org/articles/94/i43/Lodo-Therapeutics.html|work=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mehdi Rajabian''' ({{lang-fa|مهدی رجبیان}}; born October 1989)
is an Iranian composer, musician and the founder of the website [[Barg Music|Barg music]]. He was imprisoned for pursuing illegal musical activities in 2015.

==Personal life==
He learnt the hierarchies of the Iranian music during a few years commencing the learning from the masters of the traditional music and recorded and played several albums, e.g. "[[History of Iran Narrated by Setar|Research Album of the History of Iran narrated by Setar]]" as the sitarist, composer and producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freemuse.org/archives/11823|title=Iran:  Two musicians and a filmmaker sentenced|website=Freemuse|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828030311/https://freemuse.org/archives/11823|archivedate=28 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2015/12/mehdi-rajabian/|title=Underground Music Distributors Await Appeal Decision for Six Years in Prison|website=International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran|language=en-us|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2016/03/iranian-music-distributors-sentenced/|title=Iranian Music Distributors Sentenced to Three Years in Prison|website=International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran|language=en-us|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also worked as the sound recordist and the sound recording director in the several music albums. Rajabian was also a student in relation with his professional music activity; after he was arrested in 2013, he was ceased on continuing education in this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2016/03/iran-tortured-filmmaker-and-musicians-face-imminent-arrest-amid-crackdown-on-artists/|title=Iran: Tortured filmmaker and musicians face imminent arrest amid crackdown on artists|website=www.amnesty.org|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voiceproject.org/takeaction/iran-music-is-not-a-crime/|title=Iran: Music Is Not A Crime – Voice Project|website=Voice Project|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://freerajabian.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities and arrest==
Mehdi Rajabian officially participated and monitored the quality of the publication and the music composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2013/12/bargmusic/|title=IRGC Forces Arrest Music Distributors, Pressure Them to Confess on Television|website=International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran|language=en-us|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested by Iranian security forces on 5 October 2013 in his office and transferred to Ward 2A of [[Evin Prison]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.iranwire.com/features/6959/|title=Artists Sentenced to Prison|website=en.iranwire.com|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2013/12/bargmusic/&lt;/ref&gt; and each one was sentenced more than two months in solitary confinement,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hra-news.org/en/3-artists-sentenced-imprisonment-fine-appeal-court-tehran|title=3 Artists Sentenced to Imprisonment and Fine by the Appeal Court of Tehran|website=Hrana – News Agancy|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2015/12/mehdi-rajabian/&lt;/ref&gt; while this arrest ceased his personal project.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.iranwire.com/features/6959/&lt;/ref&gt; When Mehdi Rajabian was arrested, he was recording "Research Album of History of Iran narrated by Setar", his personal studio, all recordings, hard drives of recorded music were confiscated and the project became silent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/24/filmmaker-two-musicians-three-years-prison-iran|title=Film-maker and two musicians face three years prison in Iran|last=Dehghan|first=Saeed Kamali|date=24 March 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freemuse.org/archives/11823|title=Iran:  Two musicians and a filmmaker sentenced|website=Freemuse|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828030311/https://freemuse.org/archives/11823|archivedate=28 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Imprisonment and Hunger Strike ==
Mehdi Rajabian was imprisoned in the ward 7 of [[Evin Prison]] in [[Tehran]], but after a contentious struggle with the judicial officer of the prison was sent to the ward 8 for punishment. After 10 months of the period of imprisonment, he went on a [[hunger strike]] to protest against the unjust trial, lack of medical facilities in prison, and his transfer to the ward 8 isolating him from his brother. After 14 days of strike, he called off his strike by the interference of the official representative of the prosecutor sent to the prison as an intermediary. However, he published an open letter addressing the judicial authorities of Iran, could attract the supports of the artists of the world by a 30-day hunger strike, and convince the judicial authorities to give him medical leave for the treatment of diseases arising out of hunger strike. Following that, he could return to the ward 7 too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde13/5106/2016/en/|title=Further Information: Jailed Iranian artist brothers on hunger strike: Mehdi Rajabian and Hossein Rajabian|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freemuse.org/archives/13035|title=Artists call for support in letter from prison|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://voiceproject.org/post_news/two-iranian-musicians-on-hunger-strike/|title=Imprisoned Iranian Musicians on Hunger Strike - Voice Project|newspaper=Voice Project|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.amnesty.or.jp/en/get-involved/ua/ua/2016ua041.html|title=JAILED MUSICIAN AND FILMMAKER ON HUNGER STRIKE: AMNESTY JAPAN|newspaper=AMNESTY JAPAN|language=en-us|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.journalismisnotacrime.com/en/news/1567/|title=Punishment for Brothers on Hunger Strike|website=www.journalismisnotacrime.com|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/cinema/2016/11/19/03002-20161119ARTFIG00026-johnny-depp-peter-gabriel-une-pause-contre-la-censure.php|title=Johnny Depp, Peter Gabriel : une pause contre la censure|last=Trigalot|first=Yoko|date=2016-11-19|newspaper=Le Figaro|language=fr-FR|issn=0182-5852|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voiceproject.org/post_news/help-us-defend-freedom-of-expression/|title=Art is not a crime|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pen.org/press-release/2016/10/18/health-jailed-iranian-brothers-worsens-face-mistreatment-and-abuse|title=Health of Jailed Iranian Brothers Worsens in the Face of Mistreatment and Abuse {{!}} PEN America|website=pen.org|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2016/dec/01/iranian-musician-hospitalised-after-one-month-hunger-strike|title=Iranian musician hospitalised after one-month hunger strike|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/get-involved/take-action-now/urgent-action-update-gravely-ill-musician-returned-to-prison-iran-ua-4116|title=Urgent Action Update: Gravely Ill Musician Returned To Prison|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2016/09/mehdi-hossein-rajabian/|title=On Hunger Strike, Imprisoned Music Distributors’ Health Deteriorates|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2016/11/mehdi-hossein-rajabian-2/|title=Ailing Music Distributor Refuses Hospital Treatment, Vows to Hunger Strike Until Demands Met|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2016/10/mehdi-rajabian-and-hossein-rajabian/|title=Tricked Into Ending Hunger Strike, Imprisoned Music Distributors Resume Quest for Justice|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/12/02/a-jailed-iranian-musician-texts-from-his-hospital-bed-dont-forget-me/|title=A jailed Iranian musician texts from his hospital bed: Don’t forget me|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions against arrest==
The arrest of Mehdi Rajabian followed many reactions as Saeid Boumedouha's lecture, the head of Middle East and North Africa [[Amnesty International]] Organization can be noted in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2016/03/iran-tortured-filmmaker-and-musicians-face-imminent-arrest-amid-crackdown-on-artists/|title=Iran: Tortured filmmaker and musicians face imminent arrest amid crackdown on artists|website=www.amnesty.org|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rhetoric}}
'''Memoria''' was the term for aspects involving [[memory]] in Western classical [[rhetoric]]. The word is Latin, and can be translated as "memory".

It was one of five canons in classical rhetoric (the others being [[inventio]], [[dispositio]], [[elocutio]], and [[pronuntiatio]]) concerned with the crafting and delivery of speeches and prose.

The art of rhetoric grew out of [[Public speaking|oratory]], which was the central medium for intellectual and political life in ancient Greece. Legal proceedings, political debates, philosophical inquiry were all conducted through spoken discourse. Many of the great texts from that age were not written texts penned by the authors we associate them with, but were instead orations written down by followers and students. In Roman times, while there was a much greater body of written work, oration was still the medium
for critical debate. Unlike public speakers of today, who use notes or who read their speeches, good orators were expected to deliver their speeches without such aids.

''Memoria'' was the discipline of recalling the arguments of a discourse. It generally received less attention from writers than 
other parts of rhetoric, as there is less to be said about the subject. However, the need to memorize speeches did influence the structure of discourse to some extent. For example, as part of ''dispositio'', some attention was paid to creating structures (such as the ''[[Dispositio|divisio]]'', an outline of the major arguments of a discourse) that would also aid memory. Some writers also discussed the use of various mnemonic devices to assist speakers.

But rhetoricians also viewed ''memoria'' as requiring more than just rote memorization. Rather, the orator also had to have at his command a wide body of knowledge to permit improvisation, to respond to questions, and to refute opposing arguments. Where today's speech-making tends to be a staged, one-way affair, in former times, much oration occurred as part of debates, dialogues, and other settings, in which orators had to react to others. Moreover, rhetoricians also recognized that the credibility of a speaker depended not just on the strength of his prepared arguments, but on the audience's perceptions of the speaker. In Greece, Rome, and the Renaissance, a speaker's familiarity of many areas of learning was seen as a virtue.

==In the Renaissance==
When the Humanists took up the ideas on memory found the writings of Classical authors, memoria played an important role in the pedagogical system. Texts were learned first by rote memorization, then re-read for meaning. Children's ability to memorize was aided by "[[memory table]]s", which were first available in manuscript form, and were, from the 1470s onwards, some of the first products of the printing press. (Source: Paul Gehl, ''A Moral Art: Grammar, Society, and Culture in Trecento Florence'' (1993)

==Memory and Kairos==
Memory, the fourth canon of rhetoric, and invention, the first canon, are connected. The [[Rhetorica ad Herennium|ad Herennium]] states that memory is the “treasury of things invented”, indirectly referring to the custom of accumulating commonplaces. Hence, for a rhetor, memory is as much related to the need to extemporize as to the necessity to memorize a discourse for delivery; in this way it is linked to [[kairos]] and to the ideas of [[Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style|copia]] and amplification (Burton).

Crowley and Hawhee state about memory and kairos, "... kairos and memory were partnered in several ways. First, both require a kind of 'attunement' in that the rhetor who is gathering items for reserve in the memory must be thinking simultaneously about what's available now that might be useful later. Secondly, memory requires an attunement during the moment of speaking or composing, a recognition of the right time for recalling an illustrative example, an argument, and so on" (317).

==Memory Systems==
Ancient peoples used [[Art of memory|elaborate systems]], such as the [[Method of loci|Method of Loci]], to store large amounts of information in their memories. Today, we use literate and electronic memory systems. Literate memory systems include books, periodicals, and libraries. Electronic systems include computers, databases, computer software, the World Wide Web, and other artificial memory devices (Crowley and Hawhee 325-28).

==The Three Elements of the Canon of Memory==
'''Memorizing One's Speech'''
Centuries ago, ancient orators had to memorize and present speeches without the help of note cards or crib sheets. Note taking, as a way to remember certain things, was looked down upon in ancient cultures. In his Phaedrus, Plato has Socrates explaining that relying on writing or taking notes weakened the mind and memory:

''"If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls: they will cease to exercise memory because they rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves"''{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Any Greek in Ancient times who was caught using the note-taking method would be laughed at and deemed "weak-minded".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Nowadays, it is much more common for speakers to use note cards, though speeches are much more impressive without the use of notes.
 
Using memory during a speech can also affect how the orator influences the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alvi|first=Sofia Dildar|author2=Abdul Baseer|title=An Analysis Of Barack Obama's Speech 'Keynote Address At The 2004 Democratic National Convention'.|journal=Language in India|date=2011|volume=11|issue=10|pages=310–335}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the speaker addresses the audiences relying solely on their memory, they build a certain amount of ethos within the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cazacu|first=Aurel M.|title=Seneca - The Rhetor.|journal=Annals of Spiru Haret University, Journalism Studies|date=2011|volume=12|issue=1|pages=85–87|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=e25cba9d-788c-4066-9d30-6cb47a9e44a1%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=10&amp;hid=118|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memoria in relation to ethos during a speech situation can be described as a certain amount trustworthiness felt between the audience, as well as a level of similarity, authority, or expertise that the orator has over the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Ota Thomas|title=American Public Address And The Mass Media.|journal=Western Speech|date=1968|volume=32|issue=1|pages=44–49|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=e25cba9d-788c-4066-9d30-6cb47a9e44a1%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=13&amp;hid=118|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Ancient Greece, in today's society, it is much more acceptable for politicians and for people of authority to use aids when delivering addresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Ota Thomas|title=American Public Address And The Mass Media.|journal=Western Speech|date=1968|volume=32|issue=1|pages=44–49|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=e25cba9d-788c-4066-9d30-6cb47a9e44a1%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=13&amp;hid=118|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it could be viewed as an aid to use notes or teleprompters, greater importance is placed on actually conveying the information to the audience in a clear and concise manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alvi|first=Sofia Dildar|author2=Abdul Baseer|title=An Analysis Of Barack Obama's Speech 'Keynote Address At The 2004 Democratic National Convention'.|journal=Language in India|date=2011|volume=11|issue=10|pages=310–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Making One's Speech Memorable'''
For ancient orators, the excellence of how a speech was presented was more important than the simple delivery of the speech. An important feature of delivering a speech was finding ways to make one's audience remember one's speech topic. One had to be sure to one's audience learned the information or ideas presented to it.

'''Keeping a Treasury of Rhetorical Fodder'''
The third element of memory has to do with using quotes, facts, or anecdotes that could be used in future speeches. A professional orator is known to always have a treasury of rhetorical fodder close at all times.

Timberlake, "Sources and remediation for mercury contamination in aquatic systems—a literature review," Environmental Pollution, vol. 131, no. 2, pp. 323–336, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these methods are expensive, time consuming, and inefficient, hence the need for a nanofiltration technology that overcomes all of these issues.  Nanofiltration technology is very efficient in removal of mercury species due to its characteristics of having high surface area-to-volume and the fact that it's easily chemically functionalized.&lt;ref&gt;Hashim MA, Mukhopadhyay S, Sahu NJ, Sengupta B. Remediation Technologies for Heavy Metal Contaminated Groundwater. Journal of Environmental Management. 2011, June 25; 92(2011): 2355–2388.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Brownian motion of nanomaterials allows them to scan large volume of solvent in short times. There are many copolymer nanoparticles (NPs) that can be used as scavengers to eliminate mercury species via redox reactions such as selenium NPs, manganese dioxide nanowhiskers, carbon nanotube−silverNP composites, silver NPs, silver NP-decorated silicaspheres, gold NP-based materials.  Among these adsorbents, citrate-capped gold NP-based materials have been used intensively to capture mercury species from nature water.

'''Instrumentation'''

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is used to obtain the HRTEM images (FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin working at 200 kV) and double beam UV-visible spectrophotometer is used for the extinction, or removal, of the NPs gold spectra.&lt;ref&gt;Shih YC, Ke CY, Yu CJ, Lu CY, Tseng WL. Combined tween 20-stabilized gold nanoparticles and reduced graphite oxide-Fe3O4 nanoparticle composites for rapid and efficient removal of mercury species from a complex matrix. ACS Applied Mater Interfaces 2014 October 22; 6(20): 17437-17445.&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of scanning electron microscope and an energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDX) for obtaining EDX spectra while sub micrometer particle size analyzer and Delsa nano zeta potential measure the potential of gold NPs. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measures the quantification of mercury species in gold NPs while the linear range of Hg2+ should be between 2.5 and 50 nM. The powder X-ray diffraction is measured using a diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. A superconducting quantum interference device measures the magnetometry while the Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy spectrum is measured by a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer.

'''Removal of mercury species'''
[[File:Mercurynanotrapfigure2.png|thumb|Figure 2: Procedure associated with the removal of Hg2+ by the combination of Tween 20-Au NPs and reduced graphite-Fe3O4 NP composites]]

The application of an external magnetic field helps reduce the Fe3O4 NP compositions and can be used to remove the citrate capped gold NPs or Tween 20- Au NPs. The quantity of the Hg2+ is determined by ICP-MS. Elimination efficiency is calculated as:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;Elimination Efficiency (%) = [(Co – C)/ Co] x 100&lt;/div&gt;

The equilibrium absorption capacity was determined by:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;qe = (Co – Ce) x (V/W)&lt;/div&gt;

where qe is the equilibrium absorption capacity, Ce is the concentration of Hg2+, V is the volume of the solution and W is the weight of Tween 20-Au NPs. Other metals in place of mercury can be used to determine the reusability of the nanofiltration method. A simple nanofiltration process is illustrated in Figure 2.

[[File:Mercurynanotrapfigure3.png|thumb|Figure 3:A highly porous framework such as water is treated with mercury chelating groups, which serve as the "mercury nano trap". These chelating groups hold tightly onto Hg (II) ions, removing it from the water.]]When purifying mercury from sea water, a decrease in the volume to surface area ratio leads to a decline in the efficiency of the elimination.7 Cost efficiency of the nanotrap process is indicated in the fact that the materials can be reused to recycle more water. Tween 20-Au NPs are rapid, efficient and selective in capturing Hg2+ in high salt water concentration when the gold NPs catalyze the citrate ion induced reduction of Hg2+ to Hg0.&lt;ref&gt;F. S. Zhang, J. O. Nriagu, and H. Itoh, "Mercury removal from water using activated carbons derived from organic sewage sludge," Water Research, vol. 39, no. 2–3, pp. 389–395, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; ICP-MS is used to quantify the Hg2+ concentration to determine the level of elimination efficiency. Figure 3 shows an illustration process of the nano trap filtration process.

The use of nanomaterials in removing the mercury from water is advantageous because of the high surface area to volume ratio and the fact that they are easily chemically functionalized. Nanomaterials capture five times more mercury than the maximum mercury captured predicted through the use of previous mercury filtration systems.&lt;ref&gt;Kuriyama M, Haruta K, Dairaku T, Kawamura T, Kikkawa S, Inamoto K, Tsukamoto H, Kondo Y, Torigoe H, Okamoto I, Ono A, Morita EH, Tanaka Y: Hg2+-trapping beads: Hg2+-specific recognition through thymine-Hg(II)-thymine base pairing. Chem Pharm Bull; 2014;62(7):709–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other NP-based methods for Hg2+ removal from high salt matrix, Tween 20-Au NPs is a rapid and selective technique with high efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Ojea-Jiménez, Xicoténcatl López, Jordi Arbiol, and Victor Puntes: Citrate-Coated Gold Nanoparticles As Smart Scavengers for Mercury(II) Removal from Polluted Waters.

'''Miniwaste&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miniwaste.eu/?lang=EN#/ Miniwaste website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acrplus.org/miniwaste/ ACR+ - Miniwaste project presentation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921091134/http://www.acrplus.org/miniwaste |date=2011-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;''' was a European project operated from January 2010 to December 2012, designed to "bring bio-waste back to life". In other words, it was intended to demonstrate that it is possible to significantly reduce the amount of bio-waste at a local level. The project was co-funded by the LIFE+ programme of the European Commission. The project emphasized the efficiency and sustainability of bio-waste reduction actions at source, in particular by organising demonstration actions and trainings for the population, and by offering a better way of evaluating and controlling waste prevention.

==Main goals==

The project endeavors to demonstrate, in accordance with the recent [[Waste Framework Directive]], that it is possible to significantly reduce the amount of organic waste (also called "[[bio-waste]]", covering both food and green waste) at the source in a sustainable way, and to monitor actions for waste reduction in an efficient manner.

The Miniwaste project has four main objectives:
* to gather and share good practices and case studies, which allow to reduce bio-waste and are implemented by European local and regional authorities (for instance, composting);
* to reduce bio-waste in the partner countries (namely France, Portugal and the Czech Republic), by implementing '''demonstration actions''' at different scales;
* to develop and implement monitoring procedures, such as a computerised tool, allowing to assess the quality and the quantity of the compost;
* to disseminate the deliverables and results obtained by the partners, in order to provide guidance for European authorities in terms of bio-waste reduction.

==Partners==

The Miniwaste partners are the local authorities of [[Rennes Métropole]] (project leader, France), [[Brno]] (Czech Republic) and Lipor (urban area of Porto, Portugal), together with [http://www.acrplus.org/ ACR+] (Association of Cities and Regions for Recycling and Sustainable Resource Management) and [[Cemagref]] (a French composting research centre). Within the project, the three local authorities will seek, test and disseminate appropriate tools that will allow implementation and monitoring of actions for organic waste reduction on their territories. The project thus presents a way of integrating demonstrative actions at different scales (from pilot actions to large-scale actions) with different European partners.

==Events==

Apart from setting up a set of communication tools (project website, leaflet, newsletter, final report), two key events will take place in the course of the project:
* A technical workshop, which was held on 12–13 September in Brno (Czech Republic);
* Miniwaste final conference, which will take place on 20–21 November 2012 in Rennes (France).

==Reduction of bio-waste==

[[Bio-waste]] is kitchen waste (raw or cooked food waste) and green waste (garden and park waste). Reducing bio-waste can mainly be obtained by limiting food waste and by practicing collective or individual composting of food and green waste. According to studies, an average European produces between 100&amp;nbsp;kg and 250&amp;nbsp;kg of organic waste per year. 10% of this waste can be avoided by limiting food waste and almost 30 to 70% can be composted, including at source.

'''Natural Resources Engineering,''' the sixth Abet accredited environmental engineering program in the United States,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; is a subset of environmental engineering that applies various branches of science in order to create new technology that aims to protect, maintain, and establish sustainable natural resources. Specifically, natural resources engineers are concerned with applying engineering concepts and solutions to prevalent environmental issues. Common natural resources this disciple of engineering works closely with includes both living resources such as plants and animals as well as non-living resources such as renewable energy, land, soils, and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/study/subjects/natural-resources-engineering/|title=Natural Resources Engineering {{!}} University of Canterbury|website=The University of Canterbury|language=en-nz|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural resource engineering also involves researching and evaluating natural and societal forces. The hydrological cycle is the main component of natural forces and the desires of other people attribute to societal forces.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48241261|title=Natural resources engineering|last=W.|first=Tollner, Ernest|date=2002|publisher=Iowa State University Press|isbn=9780813818474|edition= 1st|location=Ames, Iowa|oclc=48241261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historical examples of applications of natural resources engineering include the Roman aqueducts and the Hoover Dam.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Natural resource engineering degrees require a basic understanding of core engineering classes including calculus, physics, chemistry, and engineering mechanics, as well as additional courses with a stronger focus on applications of natural resources in environmental systems. These specific courses include soil and water engineering, modeling of biological and physical systems, properties of biological materials, and systems optimization.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abe.psu.edu/majors/be/requirements/nre|title=Natural Resource Engineering Option (Biological Engineering Major)|website=Biological Engineering Major (Penn State University)|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall purpose of natural resource engineering is mainly categorized as either resource development, environmental management or both. Natural resource engineers often work in a vast variety of environments ranging from urban to rural.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Most natural resource engineers can be found working for groups who strive to solve current and future environmental issues such as environmental consulting firms and government agencies.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

== History ==
Natural resources engineering has always existed as an extension of biological engineering, but demand for such practices continue to increase along with increasing urbanization.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; The development of basic farming techniques, irrigation, and basic wells where a significant step in natural resources engineering for the Human race.  Important historical examples of natural resources engineering include the Roman aqueducts and the Hoover Dam. Natural resource engineering is of vital importance in developing regions to address issues such as access to clean drinking water as well as sanitation and sustainable food production. In 1981 Environmental Resource Engineering became the 6th Abet Accredited environmental engineering program in the U.S.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Environmental Resources Engineering. (n.d.). Retrieved March 31, 2018, from http://engineering.humboldt.edu/academics/history&lt;/ref&gt;  Natural resources engineering will be an important factor in how the natural environment will respond to rising pressure on environmental and agricultural resources.

== Concepts and areas of research and development ==
The discipline of Natural Resource engineering specifically concentrates on [[natural resource]]s. Natural resources are, "industrial materials and capacities (such as mineral deposits and water power) supplied by nature" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural%20resource|title=Definition of NATURAL RESOURCE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes legally are classified by their ability to be used by humans to meet their demands. Natural resources can be both living and non-living natural elements and include [[fossil fuel]]s, plants, animals, minerals, [[sediment]], and bodies of water.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}  Areas of research and development in natural resources engineering concerning the hydro-logical cycle include: erosion control, flood control, water quality renovation and management, irrigation, drainage, bio-remediation, air quality, watershed-stream assessment, and ecological engineering.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;[[File:Jackson_Guard.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jackson_Guard.jpg|thumb|Members of Jackson Guard’s wildland fire center are responsible for controlling and maintaining Eglin’s natural resources and operations areas through controlled burning of its forest]]

This discipline of engineering also involves investigating different natural and societal forces on the environment. The main natural force researched by natural resources engineers is the [[Water cycle|hydro-logical cycle]]. This cycle is concerned with how water transitions through the environment through the processes of evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and transpiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/hyd/smry.rxml|title=A Summary of the Hydrologic Cycle: bringing all the pieces together|website=ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cycle is a concern when looking at prevalent environmental issues on the earth, and therefore is a major concern for natural resource engineers. The main societal force that concerns natural resource engineers is the exploitation of natural resources by humans. This force concerns natural resource engineers because it threatens to deplete or harm many sources of natural resources.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

With this concentration on natural resources and natural and societal impact, natural resource engineers are constantly searching for ways to apply engineering concepts to create developments that aim to protect, maintain, and establish sustainable sources of natural resources. Some current areas of research and developments include: finding ways to maximize the utilization of natural resources in fuel with minimum waste,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/careers/subjects/natural-resources-engineering/|title=Natural Resources Engineering {{!}} What can I do with a degree from UC {{!}} Careers, Internships &amp; Employment {{!}} University of Canterbury|website=The University of Canterbury|language=en-nz|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; developing infrastructure and equipment with the intent to provide protection for the overall environment and sources of natural resources,&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; finding solutions to current environmental issues that directly impacted sources of natural resources such as soil erosion, sediment loss, flooding, and pollution, seeking efficient ways to manage natural resources so they will not be depleted,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nomajordrama.co.nz/Major/Environmental_and_Natural_Resources_Engineering|title=Environmental &amp; Natural Resources Engineering|website=No Major Drama|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finding ways to conserve and allocate resources efficiently as the population increases dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bae.engineering.ucdavis.edu/research/agricultural-and-natural-resources-engineering/|title=Agricultural and Natural Resources Engineering – Biological and Agricultural Engineering|website=bae.engineering.ucdavis.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Courses ==

Some of these industries include federal, state, and local government agencies(such as the Natural Resource Conservation Service),&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; environmental consulting firms, agricultural and food processing industries, and various other industries and companies that focus on solving environmental issues. In the government sector, natural resource engineers usually find themselves working on projects that work to manage government owned and operated natural resources and help solve environmental issues that impact these resources. Within an environmental consulting firm, a natural resource engineer may find themselves running calculations and making predictions about different ways to utilize natural resources to maximize their efficiency. Within different processing industries, natural resource engineers may find themselves working on waste management efficiency and natural resource processing design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/ABE/academics/undergraduate/enre.html|title=Agricultural Engineering - Emphasis Area: Environmental and Natural Resources Engineering|work=Agricultural &amp; Biological Engineering - Purdue University|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22893">'''Neural tissue engineering''' is a specific sub-field of [[tissue engineering]]. [[Nervous tissue|Neural tissue]] engineering is primarily a search for strategies to eliminate inflammation and fibrosis upon implantation of foreign substances. Often foreign substances in the form of grafts and scaffolds are implanted to promote [[nerve regeneration]] and to repair damage caused to nerves of both the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) and [[peripheral nervous system]] (PNS) by an injury.

==Introduction==
The nervous system is divided into two subsections: the CNS and the PNS. The CNS consists of the brain and the spinal cord, while the PNS consists of nerves that originate from the brain and spinal cord and innervate the rest of the body.&lt;ref name=Schmidt /&gt;

The need for neural [[tissue engineering]] arises from the difficulty of the nerve cells and neural tissues to regenerate on their own after neural damage has occurred. The PNS has some, but limited, regeneration of neural cells. Adult stem cell [[neurogenesis]] in the CNS has been found to occur in the [[hippocampus]], the [[subventricular zone]] (SVZ), and spinal cord.&lt;ref name=Temple&gt;{{cite journal|last=Temple|first=Sally|title=The development of neural stem cells|journal=Nature|date=November 2001|volume=414|issue=6859|pages=112–117|doi=10.1038/35102174}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNS injuries can be caused by [[stroke]], [[neurodegenerative disorder]]s, [[Traumatic brain injury|trauma]], or [[encephalopathy]]. A few methods currently being investigated to treat CNS injuries are: implanting stem cells directly into the injury site, delivering [[morphogen]]s to the injury site, or growing neural tissue ''[[in vitro]]'' with [[neural stem cell|neural stem]] or [[progenitor cell|progenitor]] cells in a [[3D cell culture|3D scaffold]].&lt;ref name=Forraz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forraz|first=N.|author2=Wright, K. E. |author3=Jurga, M. |author4=McGuckin, C. P. |title=Experimental therapies for repair of the central nervous system: stem cells and tissue engineering.|journal=Journal of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine|year=2013|volume=7|pages=523–536|doi=10.1002/term.552}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed use of electrospun polymeric fibrous scaffolds for neural repair substrates dates back to at least 1986 in a NIH SBIR application from Simon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317057270_NIH_SBIR_PHASE_I_GRANT_APPLICATION_FIBROUS_SUBSTRATES_FOR_CELL_CULTURE|title=NIH SBIR PHASE I GRANT APPLICATION: FIBROUS SUBSTRATES FOR CELL CULTURE (PDF Download Available)|last=Simon|first=Eric M.|date=1986|website=ResearchGate|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the PNS, a severed nerve can be reconnected and reinnervated using grafts or guidance of the existing nerve through a channel.&lt;ref name = Schmidt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Christine|author2=Jennie Leach|title=Neural Tissue Engineering: Strategies for Repair and Regeneration|journal=Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering|date=June 2003|volume=5|pages=293–347|doi=10.1146/annurev.bioeng.5.011303.120731|pmid=14527315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research into creating miniature cortexes, known as [[corticopoiesis]], and brain models, known as [[cerebral organoids]], are techniques that could further the field of neural tissue regeneration. The native cortical progenitors in corticopoiesis are neural tissues that could be effectively embedded into the brain.&lt;ref name=Gaspard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaspard|first=N.|author2=Gaillard, A. |author3=Vanderhaegen, P. |title=Making cortex in a dish: In vitro corticopoiesis from embryonic stem cells.|journal=Cell Cycle|date=August 2009|volume=8|issue=16|pages=2491–6|doi=10.4161/cc.8.16.9276|pmid=19597331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cerebral organoids are 3D human pluripotent stem cells developed into sections of the brain cortex, showing that there is a potential to isolate and develop certain neural tissues using neural progenitors.&lt;ref name = Lancaster&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lancaster|first=M.A.|title=Cerebral organoids model human brain development and microcephaly.|journal=Nature|date=August 2013|doi=10.1038/nature12517|display-authors=etal|volume=501|pages=373–379|pmc=3817409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another situation that calls for implanting a foreign tissue is use of recording [[electrode]]s.  [[Chronic Electrode Implants]] are a tool currently used in research applications to record signals from regions of the [[cerebral cortex]].  Research into the innervation of PNS neurons in patients with paralysis and prosthetics could further the knowledge of reinnervation of neural tissue in both the PNS and the CNS.&lt;ref name=Tenore /&gt; This research is capable of making one difficult aspect of neural tissue engineering, functional innervation of neural tissue, more manageable.&lt;ref name=Tenore /&gt;

== CNS ==

=== Causes of CNS injury ===
There are three main causes of CNS injury: [[stroke]], [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI), or developmental complications. [[Stroke]]s are classified as either [[hemorrhagic stroke|hemorrhagic]] (when a vessel is damaged to the point of bleeding into the brain) or [[ischemic stroke|ischemic]] (when a clot blocks the blood flow through the vessel in the brain). When a hemorrhage occurs, blood seeps into the surrounding tissue, resulting in tissue death, while ischemic hemorrhages result in a lack of blood flow to certain tissues. Traumatic brain injury is caused by external forces impacting the cranium or the spinal cord. Problems with CNS development results in abnormal tissue growth during development, thus decreasing the function of the CNS.&lt;ref name=Forraz /&gt;

[[File:Microcephaly.png|thumb|Normal Brain Development (left), Microcephaly, a type of encephalopathy (right)]]

=== Current treatments and research ===

====Implantation of stem cells to the injury site====
One method to treat CNS injury involves culturing stem cells ''[[in vitro]]'' and implanting the non-directed stem cells into the brain injury site. Implanting stem cells directly into the injury site prevents [[glial scar]] formation and promotes [[neurogenesis]] originating from the patient, but also runs the risk of tumor development, [[inflammation]], and migration of the stem cells out of the injury location. [[Tumorigenesis]] can occur due to the uncontrolled nature of the stem cell differentiation, inflammation can occur due to rejection of the implanted cells by the host cells, and the highly migratory nature of stem cells results in the cells moving away from the injury site, thus not having the desired effect on the injury site. Other concerns of neural tissue engineering include establishing safe sources of stem cells and getting reproducible results from treatment to treatment.&lt;ref name=Forraz /&gt;

Alternatively, these stem cells can act as carriers for other therapies, though the positive effects of using stem cells as a delivery mechanism has not been confirmed. Direct stem cell delivery has an increased beneficial effect if they are directed to be neuronal cells ''in vitro''. This way, the risks associated with undirected stem cells are decreased; additionally, injuries that do not have a specific boundary could be treated efficiently.&lt;ref name=Forraz /&gt;

[[File:Human embryonic stem cells.png|thumb|Human embryonic stem colonies (A), axonal outgrowths (B)]]

====Delivery of molecules to the injury site====
Molecules that promote the regeneration of neural tissue, including [[pharmaceutical drugs]], growth factors known as [[morphogen]]s, and [[miRNA]] can also be directly introduced to the injury site of the damaged CNS tissue. [[Neurogenesis]] has been seen in animals that are treated with [[psychotropic drugs]] through the inhibition of [[serotonin]] reuptake and induction of neurogenesis in the brain. When stem cells are differentiating, the cells secrete [[morphogens]] such as growth factors to promote healthy development. These morphogens help maintain [[homeostasis]] and [[signal transduction|neural signaling pathways]], and they can be delivered into the injury site to promote the growth of the injured tissues. Currently, morphogen delivery has minimal benefits because of the interactions the morphogens have with the injured tissue. Morphogens that are not innate in the body have a limited effect on the injured tissue due to the physical size and their limited mobility within CNS tissue. To be an effective treatment, the morphogens must be present at the injury site at a specific and constant concentration. miRNA has also been shown to affect neurogenesis by directing the differentiation of undifferentiated neural cells.&lt;ref name=Forraz /&gt;

====Implantation of neural tissue developed ''in vitro''====
A third method for treating CNS injuries is to artificially create tissue outside of the body to implant into the injury site. This method could treat injuries that consist of large cavities, where larger amounts of neural tissue needs to be replaced and regenerated. Neural tissue is grown ''in vitro'' with neural stem or [[progenitor cell]]s in a [[3D cell culture|3D scaffold]], forming [[embryoid body|embryoid bodies]] (EBs). These EBs consist of a sphere of stem cells, where the inner cells are undifferentiated neural cells, and the surrounding cells are increasingly more differentiated. 3D scaffolds are used to transplant tissue to the injury site and to make the appropriate interface between the artificial and the brain tissue. The scaffolds must be: [[biocompatible]], [[biodegradable]], fit injury site, similar to existing tissue in elasticity and stiffness, and support growing cells and tissues. The combination of using directed stem cells and scaffolds to support the neural cells and tissues increase the survival of the stem cells in the injury site, increasing the efficacy of the treatment.&lt;ref name=Forraz /&gt;

[[File:MESC EBs.jpg|thumb|Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (mESCs) embryoid bodies (EBs)]]

There are 6 different types of scaffolds that are being researched to use in this method for treating neural tissue injury:
*Liquid [[gels|hydrogels]] are [[cross-link]]ed hydrophobic polymer chains, and the neural stem cells are either grown on the surface of the gel or integrated into the gel during cross-linking of the polymer chains. The major drawback of liquid hydrogels is there is limited protection of the cells that are transplanted.
*[[Supportive scaffold]]s are made from solid bead-shaped or [[microporous material|microporous structures]], and can act as carriers for the transplanted cells or for the growth factors that the stem cells secrete when they are differentiating. The cells adhere to the surface of the matrix in 2D layers. The supportive scaffolds are easily transplanted into the brain injury site because of the scaffold size. They provide a matrix promoting cell adhesion and aggregation, thus increasing increased healthy cell culture.
*[[Aligning scaffold]]s can be [[synthetic biology|silk-based]], [[polysaccharide]]-based, or based on other materials such as a collagen-rich hydrogel. These gels are now enhanced with micro-patterns on the surface for the promotion of neuronal outgrowths. These scaffolds are primarily used for regeneration that needs to occur in a specific orientation, such as in spinal cord injuries.
*[[Integrative scaffold]]s are mainly used to protect the transplanted cells from mechanical forces that they are exposed to in the process of implantation into the site of the injury. These scaffolds also decrease the likelihood of having the inflammatory cells located at the site of the injury migrate into the scaffold with the stem cells. Blood vessels have been observed to grow through the scaffold, thus the scaffold and cells are being integrated into the host tissue.
*A combination of engineered scaffolds presents an option for a 3D scaffold that can have both the necessary patterns for cell adhesion and the flexibility to adapt to the ever changing environment at the injury site. [[Decellularization|Decellularized]] ECM scaffolds is an option for scaffolds because they more closely mimc the native tissue, but these scaffolds can only currently be harvested from amputations and cadavers.&lt;ref name=Forraz /&gt;

These 3D scaffolds can be fabricated using [[Solvent casting and particulate leaching|particulate leaching]], [[gas foaming]], [[fiber bonding]], [[Solvent casting and particulate leaching|solvent casting]], or [[electrospinning]] techniques; each technique creates a scaffold with different properties than the other techniques.&lt;ref name=Ko&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ko|first=J|author2=Mohtaram NK |author3=Ahmed F |title=Fabrication of poly (ϵ-caprolactone) microfiber scaffolds with varying topography and mechanical properties for stem cell-based tissue engineering applications.|journal=Journal of Biomaterials Science, Polymer Edition|date=September 2013|doi=10.1080/09205063.2013.830913|display-authors=etal|volume=25|pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incorporation success of 3D scaffolds into the CNS has been shown to depend on the stage at which the cells have differentiated. Later stages provide a more efficient implantation, while earlier staged cells need to be exposed to factors that coerce the cells to differentiate and thus respond appropriately to the signals the cells will receive at the CNS injury site.&lt;ref name=Sheen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheen|first=V. L.|author2=Arnold, M. W.|author3=Wang, Y.|author4= Macklis, J. D.|title=Neural precursor differentiation following transplantation into neocortex is dependent on intrinsic developmental state and receptor competence|journal=Experimental Neurology|date=July 1999|volume=158|issue=1|pages=47–62|doi=10.1006/exnr.1999.7104}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] is a potential co-factor to promote functional activation of ES cell-derived neurons into the CNS injury sites.&lt;ref name=Copi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Copi|first=A|author2=Jungling, K.|author3=Gottmann, K.|title=Activity- and BDNF-induced plasticity of miniature synaptic currents in ES cell-derived neurons integrated in a neocortical network|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=November 2005|volume=94|issue=6|pages=4538–43|doi=10.1152/jn.00155.2005|pmid=16293594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== PNS ==

=== Causes of PNS injury ===
Trauma to the PNS can cause damage as severe as a severance of the nerve, splitting the nerve into a [[proximal]] and [[distal]] section. The distal nerve degenerates over time due to inactivity, while the proximal end swells over time. The distal end does not degenerate right away, and the swelling of the proximal end does not render it nonfunctional, so methods to reestablish the connection between the two ends of the nerve are being investigated.&lt;ref name=Schmidt /&gt;

=== Current treatments and research ===

====Surgical reconnection====
One method to treat PNS injury is surgical reconnection of the severed nerve by taking the two ends of the nerve and suturing them together. When suturing the nerves together, the fascicles of the nerve are each reconnected, bridging the nerve back together. Though this method works for severances that create a small gap between the [[proximal]] and [[distal]] nerve ends, this method does not work over gaps of greater distances due to the tension that must be put on the nerve endings. This tension results in the [[nerve degeneration]], and therefore the nerve cannot regenerate and form a functional neural connection.&lt;ref name=Schmidt /&gt;

====Tissue grafts====
Tissue grafts utilize nerves or other materials to bridge the two ends of the severed nerve. There are three categories of tissue grafts: autologous tissue grafts, nonautologous tissue grafts, and acellular grafts.

[[Autologous tissue grafts]] transplant nerves from a different part of the body of the patient to fill the gap between either end of the injured nerve. These nerves are typically [[cutaneous nerve]]s, but other nerves have been researched as well with encouraging results. These autologous nerve grafts are the current gold standard for PNS nerve grafting because of the highly biocompatible nature of the autologous nerve graft, but there are issues concerning harvesting the nerve from the patients themselves and being able to store a large amount of autologous grafts for future use.

Nonautologous and [[acellular]] grafts (including [[Extracellular matrix|ECM]]-based materials) are tissues that do not come from the patient, but instead can be harvested from cadavers (known as [[allotransplantation|allogenic tissue]]) or animals (known as [[xenotransplantation|xenogeneic tissue]]). While these tissues have an advantage over autologous tissue grafts because the tissue does not need to be taken from the patient, difficulty arises with the potential of [[disease transmission]] and thus [[immunogenicity|immunogenic problems]]. Methods of eliminating the immunogenic cells, thus leaving behind only the ECM-components of the tissue, are currently being investigated to increase the efficacy of nonautologous tissue grafts.&lt;ref name=Schmidt /&gt;

====Guidance====
[[Nerve guidance conduit|Guidance]] methods of PNS regeneration use nerve guide channels to help [[axons]] regrow along the correct path, and may direct growth factors secreted by both ends of the nerve to promote growth and reconnection. Guidance methods reduce [[glial scar|scarring]] of the nerves, increasing the functionality of the nerves to transmit [[action potentials]] after reconnection. Two types of materials are used in guidance methods of PNS regeneration: natural-based materials and synthetic materials.

[[File:Dynamics-of-degeneration-and-regeneration-in-developing-zebrafish-peripheral-axonsreveals-a-1749-8104-7-19-S1.ogv|thumb|center|Regeneration with guidance in zebrafish peripheral axons]]

Natural-based materials are modified scaffolds stemming from [[Extracellular matrix|ECM]] components and [[glycosaminoglycans]]. [[Laminin]], [[collagen]], and [[fibronectin]], which are all [[Extracellular matrix|ECM]] components, guide axonal development and promote neural stimulation and activity. Other molecules that have the potential to promote nerve repair are: [[hyaluronic acid]], [[fibrinogen]], fibrin gels, self-assembling [[peptide]] scaffolds, [[alginate]], [[agarose]], and [[chitosan]].

[[Synthetic materials]] also provide another method for tissue regeneration in which the graft's chemical and physical properties can be controlled. Since the properties of a material may be specified for the situation in which it is being used, synthetic materials are an attractive option for PNS regeneration. The use of synthetic materials come with certain concerns, such as: easy formation of the graft material into the necessary dimensions, biodegradable, sterilizable, tear resistant, easy to operate with, low risk of infection, and low inflammation response due to the material. The material must also maintain the channel during the nerve regeneration. Currently, the materials most commonly researched mainly focus on [[polyesters]], but biodegradable [[polyurethane]], other [[polymers]], and [[biodegradable glass]] are also being investigated. Other possibilities for synthetic materials are conducting polymers and polymers biologically modified to promote cell axon growth and maintain the axon channel.&lt;ref name=Schmidt /&gt;

== Difficulty of research ==
Because there are so many factors that contribute to the success or failure of neural tissue engineering, there are many difficulties that arise in using neural tissue engineering to treat CNS and PNS injuries. First, the therapy needs to be delivered to the site of the injury. This means that the injury site needs to be accessed by surgery or drug delivery. Both of these methods have inherent risks and difficulties in themselves, compounding the problems associated with the treatments. A second concern is keeping the therapy at the site of the injury. Stem cells have a tendency to migrate out of the injury site to other sections of the brain, thus the therapy is not as effective as it could be as when the cells stay at the injury site. Additionally, the delivery of stem cells and other morphogens to the site of injury can cause more harm than good if they induce tumorigenesis, inflammation, or other unforeseen effects. Finally, the findings in laboratories may not translate to practical clinical treatments. Treatments are successful in a lab, or even an animal model of the injury, may not be effective in a human patient.&lt;ref name=LaPlaca&gt;{{cite news|last=LaPlaca|first=Michele|title=Personal Interview|date=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modeling brain tissue development ''in vitro''===
Two models for brain tissue development are [[cerebral organoid]]s and [[corticopoiesis]]. These models provide an "in vitro" model for normal brain development,&lt;ref name=Lancaster /&gt; but they can be manipulated to represent neural defects. Therefore, the mechanisms behind healthy and malfunctioning development can be studied by researchers using these models.&lt;ref name=Lancaster /&gt; These tissues can be made with either mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC)s or human ESCs. Mouse ESCs are cultured in a protein called [[Sonic Hedgehog inhibitor]] to promote the development of dorsal [[forebrain]] and study cortical fate.&lt;ref name=Gaspard /&gt;  This method has been shown to produce axonal layers that mimic a broad range of [[cortical layers]].&lt;ref name=GapardCort&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaspard|first=N|title=An intrinsic mechanism of corticogenesis from embryonic stem cells|journal=Nature|date=September 2008|volume=455|pages=351–357|doi=10.1038/nature07287|display-authors=etal|pmid=18716623}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human ESC-derived tissues use pluripotent stem cells to form tissues on scaffold, forming human EBs. These human ESC-derived tissues are formed by culturing human [[pluripotent stem cell|pluripotent]] EBs in a spinning [[bioreactor]].&lt;ref name=Lancaster /&gt;

===Targeted reinnervation===
[[Targeted reinnervation]] is a method to reinnervate the neural connections in the CNS and PNS, specifically in paralyzed patients and amputees using prosthetic limbs. Currently, devices are being investigated that take in and record the electrical signals that are propagated through neurons in response to a person's intent to move. This research could shed light on how to reinnervate the neural connections between severed PNS nerves and the connections between the transplanted 3D scaffolds into the CNS.&lt;ref name=Tenore&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tenore|first=Francesco|author2=Vogelstein, Jacob|title=Revolutionizing Prothetics: Devices for Neural Integration|journal=Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest|year=2011|volume=30|issue=3|pages=230–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Newbury Principles''' collectively refer to an [[urban planning]] guideline stating that decisions should be made based only on the planning considerations relevant to the current development, even if the consideration of ulterior purposes may lead to a greater public good. In practice, the principles are used as a test to verify the validity of conditions to be imposed by a planning authority. 

Specifically, the decision of the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''Newbury District Council v Secretary of State for the Environment'',&lt;ref&gt;''Newbury District Council v Secretary of State for the Environment'' [1981] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 578.&lt;/ref&gt; contains the following three principles when considering the reasonableness of imposing conditions on consents:

# It must be imposed for a planning purpose.
# It must fairly and reasonably relate to the development for which permission is being given.
# It must be reasonable.

The Newbury principles are applied in [[Australia]], and have been cited by courts in [[New South Wales]] and [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1981+AC+578 LawCite records].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8169">'''Placebo studies''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] academic discipline concerning the study of the [[placebo effect]]. The [[placebo effect]] is commonly characterized when patients are given a [[placebo]] or "fake" treatment and then exhibit  perceived improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson JJ, Ritenbaugh C, Nichter M | title = Reconsidering the placebo response from a broad anthropological perspectives | journal = Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 112–52 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19107582 | pmc = 2730465 | doi = 10.1007/s11013-008-9122-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This discipline was pioneered by [[Ted Kaptchuk]] and colleagues at the [[Program in Placebo Studies]] at [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]] and the [[Harvard Medical School]]. It has been found through clinical [[placebo]] studies that the [[placebo]] effect in fact plays a significant role; one specific case being the clinical trials of [[major depressive disorder]] (MDD).&lt;ref name=brunoni&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunoni AR, Lopes M, Kaptchuk TJ, Fregni F | title = Placebo response of non-pharmacological and pharmacological trials in major depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = PLOS One | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = e4824 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19293925 | pmc = 2653635 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004824 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside major depressive disorder, these placebo experiments have been noted in studies of migranes, irritable bowl syndrome, and even Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Luo|first=Yan|title=Mobile P 2P Databases|date=2017|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-17885-1_795|work=Encyclopedia of GIS|pages=1267–1274|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319178844|access-date=2018-11-23|last2=Wolfson|first2=Ouri}}&lt;/ref&gt; A treatment cannot be proven effective unless it has been properly conducted and investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.winchesterhospital.org/health-library/article?id=21849|title=Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study {{!}} Winchester Hospital|website=www.winchesterhospital.org|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Until 1955, a [[placebo]] treatment was considered a fraudulent substance administered to appease difficult patients.&lt;ref name=kaptchuk&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaptchuk TJ, Kelley JM, Deykin A, Wayne PM, Lasagna LC, Epstein IO, Kirsch I, Wechsler ME | title = Do "placebo responders" exist? | journal = Contemporary Clinical Trials | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 587–95 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18378192 | doi = 10.1016/j.cct.2008.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the defintion for Placeo has changed its connotation over the years, idealy it has come to mean the false effects are belived to be true by one's expectations. Although, it is a false substance used to satisfy one's ilness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.shsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=47b60c2f-3a13-45e2-82eb-fb70092f29f2@sessionmgr4006&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=89408012&amp;db=ers|title=Login - Sam Houston State University|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.shsu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;However, the rise of the placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT), it became widely known throughout the academic community that [[placebo]] effects could in fact result in clinical changes and results.&lt;ref name="kaptchuk"/&gt; However, the ability to distinguish the efficacious ability of placebos over a period of time as well as those who are coined responders has proven difficult for scientists.&lt;ref name="kaptchuk"/&gt;

== Double-blind ==
A [[Double-blind placebo-controlled trial|double-blind placebo]] is called so when neither the researcher nor the patients know who was given which form of treatment.  This is the most used form of the placebo methods. It differs from a single controled [[placebo]], in that the researchers actually know what patients are given which form of therapy.&lt;ref name="Moher-2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Moher D, Hopewell S, Schulz KF, Montori V, Gøtzsche PC, Devereaux PJ, Elbourne D, Egger M, Altman DG | title = CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials | journal = [[Br Med J]] | volume = 340 | pages = c869 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c869 | pmid = 20332511 | pmc = 2844943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The need in this kind of study is to cancel out the power of suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.winchesterhospital.org/health-library/article?id=21849|title=Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study {{!}} Winchester Hospital|website=www.winchesterhospital.org|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Controlled studies ==
Although the double-blind placebo method is the most common, controlled [[placebo]] expierements require a different understanding. A placebo is given to one group of patients, while the treatment being tested is given to another group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicinenet.com/hormone_therapy/article.htm#hormone_therapy_facts|title=Hormone Therapy for Women: Side Effects, Cancer Risks|work=MedicineNet|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the control is in the hands of people conducting the expierements. 

== Initial clinical experiments ==
In 1954, at [[Harvard Medical School]] a team led by [[Louis Lasagna]] lead the first known experiment to detect [[placebo]] responders.&lt;ref name=lasagna&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lasagna L, Mosteller F, Von Felsinger JM, Beecher HK | title = A study of the placebo response | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 770–9 | date = June 1954 | pmid = 13158365 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9343(54)90441-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this experiment approximately 162 postoperative patients were observed for significant pain relief from subcutaneous injections of [[placebo]] and morphine.&lt;ref name="lasagna"/&gt; Differences in response and attitude were exhibited between [[placebo]] respondents and non-placebo respondents.&lt;ref name="lasagna" /&gt; "Using Rorschach tests and qualitative interviews, respondents, compared to non-respondents, were more anxious, self-centered, viewed the hospital care as 'wonderful', had more somatic symptoms, used more cathartics, were 'talkers and were  regular church goers.".&lt;ref name="kaptchuk"/&gt; Overall, this initial study on placebo responders versus non-responders outlined the initial yet undiscovered effects of the placebo within the placebo study.

In 1957, a team led by Wolf at [[Cornell University Medical School]] conducted an experiment to determine the reliability of the placebo response within the placebo study.&lt;ref name=wolf&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolf S, Doering CR, Clark ML, Hagans JA | title = Chance distribution and placebo reactor | journal = The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | pages = 837–41 | date = June 1957 | pmid = 13429202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The conclusion produced the answer to be "the likelihood of predicting placebo responses was not enhanced by increasing the number of placebo tests performed on any individual."&lt;ref name="wolf" /&gt;

A study on double blind [[placebo]] effects from omega 3 fatty acids and their persistant climb was done in 2006. This study concluded that although the results were "too premature to evaluate," they  showed there was a relationship between the efficacy of the antidepressant placebos and the intake of omega threes PUFAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Pao-Yen|last2=Su|first2=Kuan-Pin|date=2007-07-15|title=A Meta-Analytic Review of Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressant Efficacy of Omega-3 Fatty Acids|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4088/jcp.v68n0712|journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|volume=68|issue=07|pages=1056–1061|doi=10.4088/jcp.v68n0712|issn=0160-6689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even your daily diet can trigger aspired results.

[[File:Polytropes.gif|thumb|406x406px|The normalized density as a function of scale length for a wide range of polytropic indices]]
{{see also|Polytropic process}}
In [[astrophysics]], a '''polytrope''' refers to a solution of the [[Lane–Emden equation]] in which the [[pressure]] depends upon the [[density]] in the form

:&lt;math&gt;P = K \rho^{(n+1)/n},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|&lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt;}} is [[pressure]], {{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;rho;&lt;/var&gt;}} is [[density]] and {{math|&lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;}} is a [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]] of proportionality.&lt;ref&gt;Horedt, G.P. (2004). ''Polytropes. Applications in Astrophysics and Related Fields'', Dordrecht : Kluwer. {{ISBN|1-4020-2350-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constant {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} is known as the polytropic index; note however that the [[polytropic index]] has an alternative definition as with ''n'' as the exponent.

This relation need not be interpreted as an [[equation of state]], which states ''P'' as a function of both &amp;rho; and ''T'' (the temperature); however in the particular case described by the polytrope equation there are other additional relations between these three quantities, which together determine the equation. Thus, this is simply a relation that expresses an assumption about the change of pressure with [[radius]] in terms of the change of density with radius, yielding a solution to the Lane–Emden equation.

Sometimes the word ''polytrope'' may be used to refer to an equation of state that looks similar to the [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] relation above, although this is potentially confusing and is to be avoided. It is preferable to refer to the [[fluid]] itself (as opposed to the solution of the Lane–Emden equation) as a [[Polytropic process|polytropic fluid]]. The equation of state of a polytropic fluid is general enough that such idealized fluids find wide use outside of the limited problem of polytropes.

The polytropic exponent (of a polytrope) has been shown to be equivalent to the [[pressure]] derivative of the [[bulk modulus]] &lt;ref name="mnras"&gt;Weppner, S. P., McKelvey, J. P., Thielen, K. D. and Zielinski, A. K., "A variable polytrope index applied to planet and material models", "Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society", Vol. 452, No. 2 (Sept. 2015), pages 1375–1393, Oxford University Press also found at [https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5525 the arXiv]&lt;/ref&gt; where its relation to the [[Murnaghan equation of state]] has also been demonstrated. The polytrope relation is therefore best suited for relatively low-pressure (below 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; pascals) and high-pressure (over 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; pascals) conditions when the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus, which is equivalent to the polytrope index, is near constant.

==Example models by polytropic index==
[[Image:Polytrope3n.svg|thumb|bottom|Density (normalized to average density) versus radius (normalized to external radius) for a polytrope with index n=3.]]

*[[Neutron star]]s are well [[model (abstract)|modeled]] by polytropes with index between {{math|''n'' {{=}} 0.5}} and {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}}.
*A polytrope with index {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 1.5}} is a good model for fully convective star cores&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, S. [ 1939 ] ( 1958 ). ''An Introduction to the Study of Stellar Structure'', New York : Dover. {{ISBN|0-486-60413-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, C.J., Kawaler S.D. &amp; Trimble V. ( 2004 ). ''Stellar Interiors - Physical Principles, Structure, and Evolution'', New York : Springer. {{ISBN|0-387-20089-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;(like those of [[red giant]]s), [[brown dwarf]]s, [[gas giant|giant gaseous planets]] (like [[Jupiter]]). With this index, the polytropic exponent is 5/3, which is the [[heat capacity ratio]] (&amp;gamma;) for monoatomic gas. For the interior of gaseous stars (consisting of either ionized hydrogen or helium), this follows from an [[Adiabatic_process#Ideal_gas_(reversible_process)|ideal gas]] approximation for [[natural convection]] conditions.
*A polytrope with index {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 1.5}} is also a good model for [[White dwarf|white dwarves]] of low mass, according to the [[equation of state]] of non-[[relativistic particle|relativistic]] [[degenerate matter]].&lt;ref name = Sagert2006&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0506417.pdf Sagert, I., Hempel, M., Greiner, C., &amp; Schaffner-Bielich, J. (2006). Compact stars for undergraduates. European journal of physics, 27(3), 577.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*An index {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 1.5}} polytrope is often used to model [[Terrestrial planet|rocky planet]]s as well.{{why|date=October 2018}}
*A polytrope with index {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 3}} is a good model for the cores of [[White dwarf|white dwarves]] of higer masses, according to the [[equation of state]] of [[relativistic particle|relativistic]] [[degenerate matter]].&lt;ref name = Sagert2006/&gt;
*A polytrope with index {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 3}} is usually also used to model [[Main sequence]] [[star]]s like our [[Sun]], at least in the [[radiation zone]], corresponding to the [[Radiation_zone#Eddington_stellar_model|Eddington standard model]] of [[stellar structure]].&lt;ref&gt;O.R. Pols (2011), Stellar Structure and Evolution, Astronomical Institute Utrecht, September 2011, pp. 64-68&lt;/ref&gt; 
*A polytrope with index {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 5}} has an infinite radius. It corresponds to the simplest plausible model of a self-consistent stellar system, first studied by [[Arthur Schuster|A. Schuster]] in 1883, and it has an [[Lane–Emden_equation#For_n_=_5|exact solution]].
*A polytrope with index {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} &amp;infin;}} corresponds to what is called an ''isothermal sphere'', that is an isothermal self-gravitating sphere of gas, whose structure is identical to the structure of a collisionless system of stars like a [[globular cluster]]. This is because for an ideal gas, the temperature is proportional to &amp;rho;&lt;sup&gt;1/n&lt;/sup&gt;, so infinite ''n'' corresponds to a constant temperature.

In general as the polytropic index increases, the density distribution is more heavily weighted toward the center ({{math|&lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 0}}) of the body.

{{Music eras}}
'''''Prehistoric music''''' (previously '''''primitive music''''') is a term in the [[history of music]] for all [[music]] produced in [[literate|preliterate]] cultures ([[prehistory]]), beginning somewhere in very late [[Geological history of the Earth|geological history]]. Prehistoric music is followed by [[ancient music]] in different parts of the world, but still exists in isolated areas. However, it is more common to refer to the "prehistoric" music which still survives as [[folk music|folk]], indigenous or traditional music. Prehistoric music is studied alongside other periods within [[music archaeology]]. 

Findings from [[Paleolithic]] archaeology sites suggest that prehistoric people used carving and piercing tools to create instruments. Archeologists have found [[Paleolithic flutes]] carved from bones in which lateral holes have been pierced. The [[Divje Babe flute]], carved from a [[cave bear]] [[femur]], is thought to be at least 40,000 years old. Instruments such as the seven-holed flute and various types of [[String instrument|stringed instruments]], such as the [[Ravanahatha]], have been recovered from the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] [[archaeology|archaeological]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN8170173329&amp;id=yySNDP9XVggC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=seven+holed+flute+and+various+types+of+stringed+instruments&amp;sig=0baqFLb6KItfPYLoCdFWFTCD8Sk ''The Music of India''] By Reginald MASSEY, Jamila MASSEY.

==Origins==
{{Tone|section|date=August 2013}}

Some cultures have certain instances of their [[Sound mimesis in various cultures|music intending to imitate natural sounds]]. In some instances, this feature is related to [[Imitation of sounds in shamanism|shamanistic beliefs or practice]].&lt;ref name=onom&gt;[http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf Hoppál 2006: 143] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105719/http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soy&gt;Diószegi 1960: 203&lt;/ref&gt; It may also serve entertainment (game)&lt;ref name=natt&gt;Nattiez: 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=desch&gt;[http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/inuit.htm Deschênes 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; or practical functions (for example, luring animals in hunt)&lt;ref name=natt/&gt;.

Another possible origin of music is [[motherese]], the vocal-gestural communication between mothers and infants. This form of communication involves melodic, rhythmic and movement patterns as well as the communication of intention and meaning, and in this sense is similar to music.&lt;ref&gt;Dissanayake, E. (2000). Antecedents of the temporal arts in early mother-infant interaction. In The origins of music. Edited by Nils Wallin, Bjorn Merker and Steven Brown, pp. 389-410. Cambridge, MA: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, pg 389-410&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller suggests musical displays play a role in "demonstrating fitness to mate". Based on the ideas of [[honest signal]] and the [[handicap principle]], Miller suggested that music and dancing, as energetically costly activities, were to demonstrate the physical and psychological fitness of the [[singing]] and [[dancing]] individual to the prospective mates.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G. (2000). Evolution of human music through sexual selection. In The origins of music. Edited by Nils Wallin, Bjorn Merker and Steven Brown, pp. 329-360.

==Prehistoric musical instruments==

It is likely that the first [[musical instrument]] was the [[human voice]] itself, which can make a vast array of sounds, from [[singing]], [[Hum (sound)|hum]]ming and [[whistling]] through to [[Click consonant|click]]ing, [[cough]]ing and [[yawn]]ing. (See Darwin’s ''[[Origin of Species]]'' on music and speech.) The oldest known [[Neanderthal]] [[hyoid]] bone with the modern human form has been dated to be 60,000 years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=B. Arensburg |author2=A. M. Tillier |author3=B.

Most likely the first rhythm instruments or [[percussion instruments]] involved the [[clapping]] of hands, stones hit together, or other things that are useful to create [[rhythm]] and there are examples of musical instruments which date back as far as the [[paleolithic]], although there is some ambiguity &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dar.cam.ac.uk/dcrr/dcrr002.pdf http://www.dar.cam.ac.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705110132/http://www.dar.cam.ac.uk/dcrr/dcrr002.pdf |date=2007-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; over archaeological finds which can be variously interpreted as either musical or non-musical instruments/tools. Examples of paleolithic objects which are considered unambiguously musical are bone flutes or pipes; paleolithic finds which are open to interpretation are pierced [[phalanges]] (usually interpreted as "phalangeal [[whistle]]s"), objects interpreted as [[Bullroarer (music)|bullroarers]], and [[rasp]]s.

Music can be theoretically traced to prior to the [[Paleolithic]] age, the [[anthropological]] and [[archaeological]] designation suggests that music first arose (among humans) when stone tools first began to be used by [[Hominidae|hominid]]s. The [[noise]]s produced by work such as pounding seed and roots into meal is a likely source of rhythm created by early humans.

In 2008, archaeologists discovered a bone flute in the [[Hohle Fels]] cave near [[Ulm]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wilford | first = John N. | title = Flutes Offer Clues to Stone-Age Music | journal = Nature| volume = 459| issue = 7244| pages = 248–52| publisher = The New York Times | location = | date = June 24, 2009 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/science/25flute.html |accessdate=June 29, 2009| doi = 10.1038/nature07995 | id = | pmid = 19444215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epoc.de/artikel/999323&amp;_z=798890&lt;/ref&gt; The five-holed flute has a V-shaped mouthpiece and is made from a vulture wing bone.

The oldest known wooden pipes were discovered in [[Wicklow]], [[Ireland]], in the winter of 2003. A wood-lined pit contained a group of six flutes made from yew wood, between 30 and 50&amp;nbsp;cm long, tapered at one end, but without any finger holes. They may once have been strapped together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://Flutopedia.com/dev_flutes_euroasia.htm#Wicklow_Pipes |title=The Wicklow Pipes / The Development of Flutes in Europe and Asia|author=Clint Goss |year=2012 |work=Flutopedia |accessdate=2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, several [[Gudi (instrument)|gudi]] (literally "bone flutes") were found in [[Jiahu]] in Henan Province, China. They date to about 6000 BCE. They have between 5 and 8 holes each and were made from the hollow bones of a bird, the [[red-crowned crane]]. At the time of the discovery, one was found to be still playable. The bone flute plays both the five- or seven-note scale of [[Xia Zhi]] and six-note scale of [[Qing Shang]] of the ancient [[Chinese musical system]].

==Archaeoacoustic methodology==
The use of the term 'music' is problematic within prehistory. It may be that, as in the traditional music of much of sub-Saharan Africa, the concept of 'music' as we understand it was somewhat different. Many languages traditionally have terms for music that include dance, religion or cult. The context in which prehistoric music took place has also become a subject of much study, as the sound made by music in prehistory would have been somewhat different depending on the acoustics present. The field of [[archaeoacoustics]] uses acoustic techniques to explore prehistoric sounds, soundscapes and instruments, and has included the study of ringing rocks and lithophones, of the acoustics of ritual sites such as chamber tombs and stone circles, and the exploration of prehistoric instruments using acoustic testing. Such work has included acoustic field tests to capture and analyse the impulse response of archaeological sites; acoustic tests of lithophones or 'rock gongs'; and reconstructions of soundscapes as experimental archaeology.

An academic research network, the [http://ambpnetwork.wordpress.com/ Acoustics and Music of British Prehistory Research Network], has explored this field.

==Cycladic culture==

{{Further|Music of ancient Greece|Cycladic culture}}
On the island of [[Keros]] (Κέρος), two marble statues from the late [[Neolithic]] culture called [[Early Cycladic culture]] (2900-2000 BCE) were discovered together in a single grave in the 19th century. They depict a standing [[aulos|double flute]] player and a sitting musician playing a triangular-shaped [[lyre]] or [[harp]]. The harpist is approximately {{convert|23|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} high and dates to around 2700-2500 BCE. He expresses concentration and intense feelings and tilts his head up to the light. The meaning of these and many other figures is not known; perhaps they were used to ward off evil spirits or had religious significance or served as toys or depicted figures from [[mythology]].

==Rationale==

There is a need for a [[computer program]] that is easier to operate and that requires a simpler [[data structure]] then most currently available models. Therefore, the SahysMod program was designed keeping in mind a relative simplicity of operation to facilitate the use by field technicians, engineers and project planners instead of specialized [[geohydrology|geo-hydrologists]].&lt;br&gt;
It aims at using input data that are generally available, or that can be estimated with reasonable accuracy, or that can be measured with relative ease. Although the calculations are done numerically and have to be repeated many times, the final results can be ''checked by hand'' using the formulas in this manual.

SahysMod's [[goal|objective]] is to predict the [[long-term]] hydro-[[salinity]] in terms of general [[Trend estimation|trend]]s, not to arrive at exact predictions of how, for example, the situation would be on the first of April in ten years from now.&lt;br&gt;
Further, SahysMod gives the option of the re-use of drainage and [[Water well|well]] water (e.g. for [[irrigation]]) and it can account for [[farmer]]s' responses to [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]], [[soil salinity]], water scarcity and over-pumping from the [[aquifer]]. Also it offers the possibility to introduce [[subsurface drainage]] systems at varying depths and with varying capacities so that they can be [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimized]].
Other features of SahysMod are found in the next section.

== Methods ==

=== Calculation of aquifer conditions in polygons ===
[[File:Aquifer en.svg|thumb|250px|Example of an aquifer]]

The model calculates the ground water levels and the incoming and outgoing ground water flows between the [[polygon]]s by a numerical solution of the well-known [[Boussinesq approximation (water waves)|Boussinesq equation]]. The levels and flows influence each other mutually.
The ground water situation is further determined by the vertical [[groundwater recharge]] that is calculated from the agronomic [[Hydrology (agriculture)|water balance]]. These depend again on the levels of the [[ground water]].

When semi-confined [[aquifer]]s are present, the resistance to vertical flow in the slowly permeable top-layer and the overpressure in the aquifer, if any, are taken into account.

Hydraulic [[boundary conditions]] are given as [[hydraulic head]]s in the external nodes in combination with the [[hydraulic conductivity]] between internal and external nodes. If one wishes to impose a zero [[flow conditioning|flow condition]] at the external nodes, the conductivity can be set at zero.

Further, [[aquifer]] flow conditions can be given for the internal nodes. These are required when a [[Fault (geology)|geological fault]] is present at the bottom of the aquifer or when flow occurs between the main aquifer and a deeper aquifer separated by a semi-confining layer.

The depth of the [[water table]], the [[rainfall]] and salt concentrations of the deeper layers are assumed to be the same over the whole polygon. Other parameters can very within the polygons according to type of crops and cropping rotation schedule.

=== Seasonal approach ===

The model is based on seasonal input data and returns seasonal outputs. The number of seasons per year can be chosen between a minimum of one and a maximum of four. One can distinguish for example dry, wet, cold, hot, irrigation or [[fallow]] seasons. Reasons of not using smaller input/output periods are:
#short-term (e.g., daily) inputs would require much information, which, in large areas, may not be readily available;
#short-term outputs would lead to immense output files, which would be difficult to manage and interpret;
#this model is especially developed to predict long-term trends, and predictions for the future are more reliably made on a seasonal (long-term) than on a daily (short-term) basis, due to the high variability of short-term data;
#though the precision of the predictions for the future may be limited, a lot is gained when the trend is sufficiently clear. For example, it need not be a major constraint to the design of appropriate [[soil salinity control]] measures when a certain salinity level, predicted by SahysMod to occur after 20 years, will in reality occur after 15 or 25 years.

=== Computational time steps ===

Many [[water balance]] factors depend on the level of the [[water table]], which again depends on some of the water-balance factors. Due to these mutual influences there can be non-linear changes throughout the season. Therefore, the [[computer program]] performs daily calculations. For this purpose, the seasonal water-balance factors given with the inpu] are reduced automatically to daily values. The calculated seasonal water-balance factors, as given in the output, are obtained by summations of the daily calculated values. [[Groundwater]] levels and [[soil salinity]] (the [[state variable]]s) at the end of the season are found by accumulating the daily changes of water and salt storage.

In some cases the program may detect that the time step must be taken less than 1 day for better accuracy. The necessary adjustments are made automatically.

==Data requirements==

=== Polygonal network ===
[[Image:Garmsar.gif|thumb|250px|A polygonal network]]
The model permits a maximum of 240 internal and 120 external [[polygon]]s with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6 sides each. The subdivision of the area into polygons, based on nodal points with known [[coordinates]], should be governed by the characteristics of the distribution of the [[crop]]ping, [[irrigation]], [[drainage]] and [[groundwater]] characteristics over the study area.

The nodes must be numbered, which can be done at will. With an index one indicates whether the node is internal or external. Nodes can be added and removed at will or changed from internal to external or vice versa. Through another index one indicates whether the internal nodes have an unconfined or semi-confined aquifer. This can also be changed at will.

Nodal network relations are to be given indicating the neighboring polygon numbers of each node. The program then calculates the surface area of each polygon, the distance between the nodes and the length of the sides between them using the Thiessen principle.

The [[hydraulic conductivity]] can vary for each side of the polygons.

The depth of the [[water table]], the [[rainfall]] and [[salt]] concentrations of the deeper layers are assumed to be the same over the whole polygon. Other [[parameters]] can very within the polygons according to type of crops and cropping rotation schedule.

=== Hydrological data ===
[[Image:File-Saltmod8 (2).JPG|thumb|SahysMod components]]
The method uses seasonal water balance components as input data. These are related to the surface [[hydrology]] (like rainfall, [[potential evaporation]], [[irrigation]], use of drain and well water for irrigation, [[Surface runoff|runoff]]), and the aquifer hydrology (e.g., pumping from [[Water well|wells]]). The other [[water balance]] components (like actual evaporation, downward [[percolation]], upward [[capillary rise]], [[subsurface drainage]], [[groundwater flow]]) are given as output.

The quantity of drainage water, as output, is determined by two drainage intensity factors for drainage above and below drain level respectively (to be given with the input data) and the height of the water table above the given drain level. This height results from the computed water balance Further, a drainage reduction factor can be applied to simulate a limited operation of the drainage system. Variation of the drainage intensity factors and the drainage reduction factor gives the opportunity to simulate the effect of different drainage options.

To obtain accuracy in the computations of the ground water flow (sect. 2.8), the actual evaporation and the capillary rise, the computer calculations are done on a daily basis. For this purpose, the seasonal hydrological data are divided by the number of days per season to obtain daily values. The daily values are added to yield seasonal values.

=== Cropping patterns/rotations ===

The input data on irrigation, evaporation, and surface runoff are to be specified per season for three kinds of agricultural practices, which can be chosen at the discretion of the user:

:A: irrigated land with crops of group A
:B: irrigated land with crops of group B
:U: non-irrigated land with rain-fed crops or fallow land
[[File:Plain of punjab.jpg|thumb|250px|Irrigated land]]

The groups, expressed in fractions of the total area, may consist of combinations of [[crop]]s or just of a single kind of crop. For example, as the A-type crops one may specify the lightly irrigated cultures, and as the B type the more heavily irrigated ones, such as [[sugarcane]] and [[rice]]. But one can also take A as rice and B as sugar cane, or perhaps [[tree]]s and [[orchard]]s. A, B and/or U crops can be taken differently in different seasons, e.g. A=[[wheat]] plus [[barley]] in winter and A=[[maize]] in summer while B=[[vegetable]]s in winter and B=[[cotton]] in summer. Non-irrigated land can be specified in two ways: (1) as U = 1&amp;minus;A&amp;minus;B and (2) as A and/or B with zero irrigation. A combination can also be made.

Further, a specification must be given of the seasonal [[crop rotation|rotation]] of the different [[land use]]s over the total area, e.g. full rotation, no rotation at all, or incomplete rotation.  This occurs with a rotation index. The rotations are taken over the seasons within the year. To obtain rotations over the years it is advisable to introduce annual input changes as explained

When a fraction A1, B1 and/or U1 differs from the fraction A2, B2 and/or U2 in another season, because the irrigation regime changes in the different seasons, the program will detect that a certain rotation occurs. If one wishes to avoid this, one may specify the same fractions in all seasons (A2=A1, B2=B1, U2=U1) but the crops and irrigation quantities may be different and may need to be proportionally adjusted. One may even specify irrigated land (A or B) with zero irrigation, which is the same as un-irrigated land (U).

[[crop rotation|Cropping rotation]] schedules vary widely in different parts of the world. Creative combinations of area fractions, rotation indexes, irrigation quantities and annual input changes can accommodate many types of agricultural practices.

Variation of the area fractions and/or the rotational schedule gives the opportunity to [[simulate]] the effect of different agricultural practices on the water and salt balance.

=== Soil strata, type of aquifer ===

SahysMod accepts four different reservoirs of which three are in the soil profile:

:s: a surface reservoir,
:r: an upper (shallow) soil reservoir or root zone,
:x: an intermediate soil reservoir or transition zone,
:q: a deep reservoir or main [[aquifer]].

The upper soil reservoir is defined by the soil depth, from which water can evaporate or be taken up by plant roots. It can be taken equal to the root zone. It can be saturated, unsaturated, or partly saturated, depending on the water balance. All water movements in this zone are vertical, either upward or downward, depending on the water balance. (In a future version of Sahysmod, the upper soil reservoir may be divided into two equal parts to detect the trend in the vertical salinity distribution.)

The transition zone can also be saturated, unsaturated or partly saturated. All flows in this zone are horizontal, except the flow to subsurface drains, which is radial.
If a horizontal subsurface drainage system is present, this must be placed in the transition zone, which is then divided into two parts: an upper transition zone (above drain level) and a lower transition zone (below drain level).

If one wishes to distinguish an upper and lower part of the transition zone in the absence of a subsurface drainage system, one may specify in the input data a drainage system with zero intensity.

The aquifer has mainly horizontal flow. Pumped [[Water well|wells]], if present, receive their water from the aquifer only. The flow in the aquifer is determined in dependence of spatially varying depths of the aquifer, levels of the water table, and [[hydraulic conductivity]].

SahysMod permits the introduction of ''phreatic'' ([[unconfined aquifer|unconfined]]) and ''semi-confined'' aquifers. The latter may develop a hydraulic over or under pressure below the slowly permeable top-layer ([[aquitard]]).

=== Agricultural water balances ===
[[File:WatBalan.JPG|thumb|250px|Inflow and outflow factors of water into and out from the soil reservoirs needed to find the waterbalances]]
The agricultural [[water balance]]s are calculated for each soil reservoir separately as shown in the article [[Hydrology (agriculture)]]. The excess water leaving one reservoir is converted into incoming water for the next reservoir. The three soil reservoirs can be assigned different thickness and storage coefficients, to be given as input data. When, in a particular situation the transition zone or the aquifer is not present, they must be given a minimum thickness of 0.1 m.

The depth of the [[water table]] at the end of the previous time step, calculated from the [[water balance]]s, is assumed to be the same within each [[polygon]]. If this assumption is not acceptable, the area must be divided into a larger number of polygons.

Under certain conditions, the height of the water table influences the water-balance components. For example, a rise of the water table towards the soil surface may lead to an increase of capillary rise, actual evaporation, and subsurface drainage, or a decrease of percolation losses. This, in turn, leads to a change of the water-balance, which again influences the height of the water table, etc. This chain of reactions is one of the reasons why Sahysmod has been developed into a [[computer program]], in which the computations are made day by day to account for the chain of reactions with a sufficient degree of [[accuracy]].

=== Drains, wells, and re-use ===
[[File:DrainSection2.png|thumb|250px|Parameters of a horizontal subsurfce drainage system]]
The sub-surface [[Drainage system (agriculture)|drainage]] can be accomplished through drains or pumped wells.

The subsurface drains, if any, are characterized by drain depth and ''drainage capacity''. The drains are located in the transition zone. The subsurface drainage facility can be applied to natural or artificial drainage systems. The functioning of an artificial drainage system can be regulated through a drainage control factor.

By installing a drainage system with zero capacity one obtains the opportunity to have separate water and salt balances in the transition above and below drain level.

The pumped [[Water well|wells]], if any, are located in the aquifer. Their functioning is characterized by the well [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]].

The drain and well water can be used for [[irrigation]] through a ''(re)use factor''. This may affect the water and salt balance and on the irrigation efficiency or sufficiency.

=== Salt balances ===
[[File:Mpbas.gif|thumb|250px|Graphic example of soil salinity trends in the transition zone]]

The [[Soil salinity control|salt balances]] are calculated for each soil reservoir separately. They are based on their [[Hydrology (agriculture)|water balances]], using the salt concentrations of the incoming and outgoing water. Some concentrations must be given as input data, like the initial salt concentrations of the water in the different soil reservoirs, of the irrigation water and of the incoming groundwater in the aquifer. The concentrations are expressed in terms of [[electric conductivity]] (EC in dS/m). When the concentrations are known in terms of g salt/l water, the rule of thumb: 1 g/l -&gt; 1.7 dS/m can be used. Usually, salt concentrations of the soil are expressed in ECe, the electric conductivity of an extract of a saturated soil paste. In Sahysmod, the salt concentration is expressed as the EC of the soil moisture when saturated under field conditions. As a rule, one can use the conversion rate EC : ECe = 2 : 1. The principles used are correspond to those described in the article [[soil salinity control]].

Salt concentrations of outgoing water (either from one reservoir into the other or by subsurface drainage) are computed on the basis of salt balances, using different leaching or salt mixing efficiencies to be given with the input data. The effects of different [[Leaching model (soil)#Leaching efficiency|leaching efficiencies]] can be simulated varying their input value.

If drain or well water is used for irrigation, the method computes the salt concentration of the mixed irrigation water in the course of the time and the subsequent effect on the soil and ground water salinity, which again influences the salt concentration of the drain and well water. By varying the fraction of used drain or well water (through the input), the long-term effect of different fractions can be simulated.

The [[solvation|dissolution]] of solid soil minerals or the [[precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]] of poorly soluble salts is not included in the computation method. However, but to some extent, it can be accounted for through the input data, e.g. increasing or decreasing the salt concentration of the irrigation water or of the incoming water in the [[aquifer]]. In a future version, the precipitation of gypsum may be introduced.

=== Farmers' responses ===

If required, farmers' responses to [[waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]] and [[soil salinity]] can be automatically accounted for. The method can gradually decrease:

# The amount of [[irrigation]] water applied when the water table becomes shallower depending on the kind of crop (paddy rice and non-rice)
# The fraction of irrigated land when the available [[irrigation]] water is scarce;
# The fraction of irrigated land when the [[soil salinity]] increases; for this purpose, the salinity is given a [[stochastic]] interpretation;
# The [[groundwater]] abstraction by pumping from [[Water well|wells]] when the water table drops.

The farmers' responses influence the water and salt balances, which, in turn, slows down the process of water logging and salinization. Ultimately a new equilibrium situation will arise.

The user can also introduce farmers' responses by manually changing the relevant input data. Perhaps it will be useful first to study the automatic farmers' responses and their effect first and thereafter decide what the farmers' responses will be in the view of the user.

=== Annual input changes ===

The program runs either with fixed input data for the number of years determined by the user. This option can be used to predict future developments based on long-term average input values, e.g. rainfall, as it will be difficult to assess the future values of the input data year by year.

The program also offers the possibility to follow historic records with annually changing input values (e.g. rainfall, irrigation, cropping rotations), the calculations must be made year by year. If this possibility is chosen, the program creates a transfer file by which the final conditions of the previous year (e.g. water table and salinity) are automatically used as the initial conditions for the subsequent period. This facility makes it also possible to use various generated rainfall sequences drawn randomly from a known rainfall probability distribution and to obtain a stochastic prediction of the resulting output parameters.

Some input parameters should not be changed, like the nodal network relations, the system [[geometry]], the thickness of the soil layers, and the total [[porosity]], otherwise illogical jumps occur in the water and salt balances. These parameters are also stored in the transfer file, so that any impermissible change is overruled by the transfer data. In some cases of incorrect changes, the program will stop and request the user to adjust the input.

==Output data==
[[Image:GOHANAFREQ.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Cumulative frequency distribution of soil salinity]]
[[Image:GarmsarDWT.png|thumb|right|250px|Example of the polygonal mapping facilities using the depth of the watertable]]
The output is given for each season of any year during any number of years, as specified with the input data. The output data comprise hydrological and salinity aspects.&lt;br&gt;
As the soil salinity is very variable from place to place (figure left) SahysMod includes [[Cumulative frequency analysis|frequency distributions]] in the output. The figure was made with the CumFreq program [http://www.waterlog.info/cumfreq.htm] .&lt;br&gt; 
The output data are filed in the form of tables that can be inspected directly, through the user menu, that calls selected groups of data either for a certain [[polygon]] over time, or for a certain season over the polygons. &lt;br /&gt;
The model includes mapping facilties of output data. Also, the program has the facility to store the selected data in a [[spreadsheet]] format for further analysis and for import into a [[GIS]] program. &lt;br /&gt;
Different users may wish to establish different cause-effect relationships. The program offers only a limited number of standard [[graphics]], as it is not possible to foresee all different uses that may be made. This is the reason why the possibility for further analysis through spreadsheet programs was created.&lt;br&gt;
Although the [[computations]] need many [[iterations]], all the end results can be ''checked by hand'' using the equations presented in the manual.

The '''distinction between sex and gender''' differentiates a person's [[biological sex]] (the anatomy of an individual's [[reproductive system]], and [[secondary sex characteristic]]s) from that person's [[gender]], which can refer to either social roles based on the sex of the person ([[gender role]]) or personal identification of one's own gender based on an internal awareness ([[gender identity]]).&lt;ref name="Virginia"&gt;Prince, Virginia. 2005.

Among scientists, the term ''sex differences'' (as compared to ''gender differences'') is typically applied to [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] traits that are hypothesized to be evolved consequences of [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref name="Mealey, L. 2000"&gt;Mealey, L.

== Sex ==
[[Anisogamy]], or the size differences of [[gamete]]s (sex cells), is the defining feature of the two sexes. By definition, males have small, mobile gametes ([[sperm]]); females have large and generally immobile gametes ([[Egg cell|ova]] or eggs).&lt;ref&gt;Daly, M. &amp; Wilson, M. (1983).

Monterey: Brooks Cole&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, typical male or female [[sexual differentiation]] includes the presence or absence of a [[Y chromosome]], the type of [[gonad]]s ([[ovary]] or [[testes]]), the balance of [[sex hormone]]s ([[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]]), the [[Human reproductive system|internal reproductive anatomy]] (e.g. [[uterus]] or [[prostate gland]]), and the external genitalia (e.g. [[penis]] or [[vulva]]).&lt;ref name="KnoxSchacht2011"&gt;Knox, David; Schacht, Caroline.

=== History ===
Historian [[Thomas W. Laqueur]] suggests that from the Renaissance to the 18th century, there was a prevailing inclination among doctors towards the existence of only one biological sex (the [[one-sex and two-sex theories|one-sex theory]], that women and men had the same fundamental reproductive structure).&lt;ref&gt;Lacqueur, Thomas Walter, ''Making Sex: Body and Gender From the Greeks to Freud'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard Univ. Press, 1st Harvard Univ. Press pbk. ed. [5th printing?] 1992 ({{ISBN|0-674-54355-6}}), © 1990), p.&amp;nbsp;134 (author prof. history Univ. Calif., Berkeley).&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[discourse]]s, this view persisted into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Thomas, ''Making Sex'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;[149] (italics added).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Thomas, ''Making Sex'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;150–151.&lt;/ref&gt; Laqueur asserts that even at its peak, the one-sex model was supported among highly educated Europeans but is not known to have been a popular view nor one entirely agreed upon by doctors who treated the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Thomas, ''Making Sex'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;68 &amp; 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Sex and gender took center stage in America in the time of wars, when women had to work and men were at war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender Roles: A Sociological Perspective|last = Lindsey|first = Linda.

== Gender ==
In the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', ''gender'' is defined as, "[i]n mod[ern] (esp[escially] feminist) use, a euphemism for the sex of a human being, often intended to emphasize the social and cultural, as opposed to the biological, distinctions between the sexes.", with the earliest example cited being from 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50093521?query_type=word&amp;queryword=gender&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=a4MJ-mHKT13-2771&amp;hilite=50093521 ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (2d ed. (online) 1989)], as accessed Aug. 22, 2010, ''gender'', noun, sense 3b.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''American Heritage Dictionary'' (5th edition), in addition to defining gender the same way that it defines biological sex, also states that ''gender'' may be defined by identity as "neither entirely female nor entirely male"; its ''Usage Note'' adds:&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people maintain that the word ''sex'' should be reserved for reference to the biological aspects of being male or female or to sexual activity, and that the word ''gender'' should be used only to refer to sociocultural roles. ... In some situations this distinction avoids ambiguity, as in ''gender research'', which is clear in a way that ''sex research'' is not. The distinction can be problematic, however. Linguistically, there isn't any real difference between ''gender bias'' and ''sex bias'', and it may seem contrived to insist that ''sex'' is incorrect in this instance.&lt;ref name="ahdictionary.com, 5th ed"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A working definition in use by the World Health Organization for its work is that "'[g]ender' refers to the [[social constructionism|socially constructed]] roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women" and that "'masculine' and 'feminine' are gender categories."&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt; The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) used to use ''gender'' instead of ''sex'' when referring to physiological differences between male and female organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/58fr39406.htm|title=Guideline for the Study and Evaluation of Gender Differences in the Clinical Evaluation of Drugs|author=|date=|website=hhs.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170913082514/https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/58fr39406.htm|archivedate=13 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, they reversed their position on this and began using ''sex ''as the biological classification and ''gender'' as "a person's self representation as male or female, or how that person is responded to by social institutions based on the individual's gender presentation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm283453.htm|title = Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff Evaluation of Sex Differences in Medical Device Clinical Studies|date = December 19, 2011|accessdate = August 3, 2014|website = U.S. Food and Drug Administration|publisher = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140809152800/http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm283453.htm|archivedate = August 9, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gender'' is also now commonly used even to refer to the physiology of non-human animals, without any implication of social gender roles.&lt;ref name="haig"/&gt;

[[GLAAD]] (formerly the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) makes a distinction between sex and gender in their most recent Media Reference Guide: Sex is "the classification of people as male or female" at birth, based on bodily characteristics such as chromosomes, hormones, internal reproductive organs, and genitalia. Gender identity is "one's internal, personal sense of being a man or woman (or a boy or a girl)".&lt;ref&gt;Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.

Some [[Feminist philosophy|feminist philosophers]] maintain that gender is totally undetermined by sex. See, for example, ''[[The Dialectic of Sex|The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution]]'', a widely influential feminist text.&lt;ref&gt;Benewick, Robert and Green, Philip, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oWYbQkVyGMcC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Shulamith+Firestone&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=Shulamith%20Firestone&amp;f=false Shulamith Firestone 1945–], ''The Routledge dictionary of twentieth-century political thinkers'' (2nd Edition), Routledge, 1998, pp. 84-86. {{ISBN|0-415-09623-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case of [[David Reimer]], who was, according to studies published by [[John Money]], raised as a girl after a botched circumcision, was described in the book ''As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl''. Reimer was in fact not comfortable as a girl and later changed gender identity back to male when discovered the truth of his surgery. He eventually committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Rosario, Vernon. 2009.

=== History ===
Gender in the sense of social and behavioral distinctions, according to archaeological evidence, arose "at least by some 30,000 years ago".&lt;ref&gt;Adovasio, J. M., Olga Soffer, &amp; Jake Page, ''The Invisible Sex: Uncovering the True Roles of Women in Prehistory'' (Smithsonian Books &amp; Collins (HarperCollinsPublishers), 1st Smithsonian Books ed. 2007 ({{ISBN|978-0-06-117091-1}})), p. [277].&lt;/ref&gt; More evidence was found as of  "26,000 years ago",&lt;ref&gt;Adovasio, J. M., ''et al.'', ''The Invisible Sex'', ''op. cit.'', p. 170 &amp; see pp. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; at least at the archeological site [[Dolní Věstonice (archaeology)|Dolní Věstonice I]] and others, in what is now the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Adovasio, J. M., ''et al.'', ''The Invisible Sex'', ''op. cit.'', p. [169].&lt;/ref&gt; This is during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, power and privilege in modern Europe|author1=Richard, penny  |author2=Jessica Munna |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Pearson/ Longman|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historic meaning of ''gender'', ultimately derived from Latin ''genus'', was of "kind" or "variety". By the 20th century, this meaning was obsolete, and the only formal use of ''gender'' [[Grammatical gender|was in grammar]].&lt;ref name=udry /&gt; This changed in the early 1970s when the work of John Money, particularly the popular college textbook ''Man &amp; Woman, Boy &amp; Girl'', was embraced by [[feminist theory]]. This meaning of ''gender'' is now prevalent in the social sciences, although in many other contexts, ''gender'' includes ''sex'' or replaces it.&lt;ref name=haig /&gt; Gender was first only used in languages to describe the feminine and masculine words, up until around the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mikkola|first=Mari|title=Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/feminism-gender/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction in linguistics ==
{{See also|Language and gender}}
Since the social sciences now distinguish between biologically defined ''sex'' and socially constructed ''gender'', the term ''gender'' is now also sometimes used by linguists to refer to social gender as well as grammatical gender. Traditionally, however, a distinction has been made by linguists between ''sex'' and ''gender'', where ''sex'' refers primarily to the attributes of  real-world entities – the relevant extralinguistic attributes being, for instance,  male, female, non-personal, and indeterminate sex – and [[grammatical gender]] refers to a category, such as  masculine, feminine, and neuter (often based on sex, but not exclusively so in all languages), that determines the [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] between nouns of different genders and associated words, such as articles and adjectives.&lt;ref name="Huddleston on grammatical gender"&gt;{{Cite book|pages=484–486|last1=Huddleston |first1=Rodney |authorlink1=Rodney Huddleston|last2= Pullum |first2= Geoffrey |authorlink2=Geoffrey Pullum|title=The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge; New York |isbn=0-521-43146-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Butterfield on grammatical gender"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Fowler|first1= Henry Watson | editor1-link=Jeremy Butterfield|editor1-last=Butterfield|editor1-first=Jeremy|edition=4th|date=2015|title=[[Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]''|publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0-19-966135-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language]]'', for instance, states {{Quote|text=By GENDER is meant a grammatical classification of nouns, pronouns, or other words in the noun phrase according to certain meaning-related distinctions, especially a distinction related to the sex of the referent.&lt;ref name="Quirk on grammatical gender"&gt;{{Cite book|pages=314–316|last1=Quirk|first1=Randolph|authorlink1=Randolph Quirk|last2=Greenbaum|first2=Sidney

Nouns referring to people and animals of known sex are ''generally''  referred to by nouns with the equivalent gender. Thus ''Mann'' (meaning man) is masculine and is associated with a masculine definite article to give ''der Mann'', while ''Frau'' (meaning woman) is feminine and is associated with a feminine definite article to give ''die Frau''. However the words for inanimate objects are commonly masculine (e.g. ''der Tisch'', the table) or feminine (''die Armbanduhr'', the watch), and grammatical gender can diverge from biological sex; for instance the feminine noun ''[die] Person'' refers to a person of either sex, and the neuter noun ''[das] Mädchen'' means "the girl".

In modern English, there is no true grammatical gender in this sense,&lt;ref name="Huddleston on grammatical gender"/&gt; though the differentiation, for instance, between the pronouns "he" and "she", which in English refers to a difference in sex (or social gender), is sometimes referred to as a gender distinction. ''A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language'', for instance, refers to the semantically based "covert" gender (e.g. male and female, not masculine and feminine) of English nouns, as opposed to the "overt" gender of some English pronouns; this yields ''nine'' gender classes: male, female, dual, common, collective, higher male animal, higher female animal, lower animal, and inanimate, and these semantic gender classes affect the possible choices of pronoun for coreference to the real-life entity, e.g. ''who'' and ''he'' for ''brother'' but ''which'' and ''it'' or ''she'' for ''cow''.&lt;ref name="Quirk on grammatical gender"/&gt;

==West and Zimmerman's "Doing gender"==
{{Main|Doing gender}}
Used primarily in sociology and gender studies, "''[[doing gender]]"'' is the socially constructed performance which takes place during routine human interactions, rather than as a set of essentialized qualities based on one's biological sex.&lt;ref name=west1&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Doing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 125&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243287001002002 | jstor = 189945 | date = June 1987 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243287001002002 | ref = harv | postscript = . }} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225165833/https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf |date=2015-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term first appeared in Candace West and Don Zimmerman’s article “Doing Gender”, published in the peer-reviewed journal, ''[[Gender &amp; Society|Gender and Society]]''.&lt;ref name=jurik&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jurik | first1 = Nancy C. | last2 = Siemsen | first2 =  Cynthia | title = Doing gender as canon or agenda: A symposium on West and Zimmerman | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 72&amp;ndash;75 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243208326677 | jstor = 20676750 | date = February 2009 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243208326677 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally written in 1977 but not published until 1987,&lt;ref name=wz&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Accounting for doing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 112&amp;ndash;122 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243208326529 | jstor = 20676758 | date = February 2009 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243208326529 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Doing Gender'' is the most cited article published in ''Gender and Society''.&lt;ref name=jurik/&gt;

West and Zimmerman state that to understand gender as activity, it is important to differentiate between sex, sex category, and gender.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt;{{rp|127}} They say that sex refers to the socially agreed upon specifications that establish one as male or female; sex is most often based on an individual's genitalia, or even their chromosomal typing before birth.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt; They consider sex categories to be dichotomous, and that the person is placed in a sex category by exhibiting qualities exclusive to one category or the other. During most interactions, others situate a person's sex by identifying their sex category; however, they believe that a person's sex need not align with their sex category.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt; West and Zimmerman maintain that the sex category is "established and sustained by the socially required identificatory displays that proclaim one’s membership in one or the other category".&lt;ref name=west1/&gt;{{rp|127}} Gender is the performance of attitudes and actions that are considered socially acceptable for one's sex category.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt;{{rp|127}}

West and Zimmerman suggested that the interactional process of ''doing gender'', combined with socially agreed upon gender expectations, holds individuals accountable for their gender performances.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt; They also believe that while "doing gender" appropriately strengthens and promotes social structures based on the gender dichotomy, it inappropriately does not call into question these same social structures; only the individual actor is questioned.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt; The concept of "doing gender" recognizes that gender both structures human interactions and is created through them.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt;

== Criticism of the "sex difference" versus "gender difference" distinction ==

The current distinction between the terms ''sex difference'' versus ''gender difference'' has been criticized as misleading and counterproductive. These terms suggest that the behavior ''of an individual'' can be partitioned into separate biological and cultural factors. (However, behavioral differences between individuals can be statistically partitioned, as studied by [[behavioral genetics]].) Instead, all behaviors are phenotypes—a complex interweaving of both nature and nurture.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, D., &amp;  Kaufer, D. (2011).  [http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/31233/title/Beyond-Nature-vs--Nurture/ Beyond Nature vs. Nurture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104094323/http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view%2FarticleNo%2F31233%2Ftitle%2FBeyond-Nature-vs--Nurture%2F |date=2014-01-04 }}.  The Scientist.  October 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diane F. Halpern|Diane Halpern]], in her book ''[[Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities]],'' argued problems with ''sex'' vs. ''gender'' terminology:  "I cannot argue (in this book) that nature and nurture are inseparable and then... use different terms to refer to each class of variables.  The  ...biological manifestations of sex are confounded with psychosocial variables.... The use of different terms to label these two types of contributions to human existence seemed inappropriate in light of the biopsychosocial position I have taken."  She quotes [[Steven Pinker]]'s summary of the problems with the terms sex and gender: "Part of it is a new prissiness -- many people today are as squeamish about sexual dimorphism as the Victorians were about sex. But part of it is a limitation of the English language. The word 'sex' refers ambiguously to copulation and to sexual dimorphism..."&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, D. (2012). Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities (4th Ed.). NY: Psychology Press. p. 35 - 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Lippa writes in ''Gender, Nature and Nurture'' that "Some researchers have argued that the word ''sex'' should be used to refer to (biological differences), whereas the word ''gender'' should be used to refer to (cultural differences). However, it is not at all clear the degree to which the differences between males and females are due to biological factors versus learned and cultural factors. Furthermore, indiscriminate use of the word ''gender'' tends to obscure the distinction between two different topics: (a) differences between males and females, and (b) individual differences in maleness and femaleness that occur within each sex."&lt;ref&gt;Lippa, R.

It has been suggested that more useful distinctions to make would be whether a behavioral difference between the sexes is first due to an evolved [[adaptation]], then, if so, whether the adaptation is sexually dimorphic (different) or sexually monomorphic (the same in both sexes). The term ''sex difference'' could then be re-defined as between-sex differences that are manifestations of a sexually dimorphic adaptation (which is how many scientists use the term),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/grads/Sell/(2009)%20Standards%20of%20evidence%20for%20designed%20sex%20differences.pdf|title=Standards of evidence for designed sex differences|author=|date=|website=ucsb.edu|accessdate=14 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223410/http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/grads/Sell/(2009)%20Standards%20of%20evidence%20for%20designed%20sex%20differences.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bourke CH |author2=Harrell CS |author3=Neigh GN |title=Stress-induced sex differences: adaptations mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=210–8 |date=August 2012  |pmid=22426413 |pmc=3384757 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2012.02.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the term ''gender difference'' could be re-defined as due to differential socialization between the sexes of a monomorphic adaptation or byproduct. For example, greater male propensity toward physical aggression and risk taking would be termed a "sex difference;" the generally longer head hair length of females would be termed a "gender difference."&lt;ref&gt;Mills, M.E.

== Feminism ==

===General===
Many feminists consider sex to only be a matter of biology and something that is not about social or cultural construction. For example, Lynda Birke, a feminist biologist, states that "'biology' is not seen as something which might change."&lt;ref&gt;Birke, Lynda (2001). "In Pursuit of Difference: Scientific Studies of Women and Men," Muriel Lederman and Ingrid Bartsch eds., The Gender and Science Reader, New York: Routledge. p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the sex/gender distinction, also known as the Standard Model of Sex/Gender, is criticized by feminists who believe that there is undue emphasis placed on sex being a biological aspect, something that is fixed, natural, unchanging, and consisting of a male/female dichotomy. They believe the distinction fails to recognize anything outside the strictly male/female dichotomy and that it creates a barrier between those that fit as 'usual' and those that are 'unusual'. In order to prove that sex is not only limited to two categories [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]]'s ''Sexing the Body'' addresses the birth of children who are intersex. In this case, the standard model (sex/gender distinction) is seen as incorrect with regard to its notion that there are only two sexes, male and female. This is because "complete maleness and complete femaleness represent the extreme ends of a spectrum of possible body types."&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne "Of Gender and Genitals" from Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction of sexuality New York, NY: Basic Books, 2000, [Chapter 3, pp. 44-77].&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Fausto-Sterling argues that there are multitudes of sexes in between the two extremes of male and female.

Rather than viewing sex as a biological construct, there are feminists who accept both sex and gender as a social construct. According to the [[Intersex Society of North America]], "nature doesn't decide where the category of 'male' ends and the category of 'intersex' begins, or where the category of 'intersex' ends and the category of 'female' begins. Humans decide. Humans (today, typically doctors) decide how small a penis has to be, or how unusual a combination of parts has to be, before it counts as intersex."&lt;ref&gt;ISNA."Frequently Asked Questions." Intersex Society of North America 1993-2008. {{cite web |url=http://www.isna.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519013103/http://www.isna.org/ |archivedate=2016-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fausto-Sterling believes that sex is socially constructed because nature does not decide on who is seen as a male or female physically. Rather, doctors decide what seems to be a "natural" sex for the inhabitants of society. In addition, the gender, behavior, actions, and appearance of males/females is also seen as socially constructed because codes of femininity and masculinity are chosen and deemed fit by society for societal usage.

=== Limitations ===

Some feminists go further and argue that neither sex nor gender are strictly binary concepts. [[Judith Lorber]], for instance, has stated that many conventional indicators of sex are not sufficient to demarcate male from female. For example, not all women lactate, while some men do.&lt;ref name="lorber"&gt;Lorber, Judith (1993). [http://www.unm.edu/~edickins/Lorber_Seeing_is_Believing.pdf "Believing is Seeing: Biology as Ideology"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124221303/http://www.unm.edu/~edickins/Lorber_Seeing_is_Believing.pdf |date=2013-01-24 }}. Retrieved on 8 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Suzanne Kessler, in a 1990 survey of medical specialists in pediatric intersexuality, found out that when a child was born with XY chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia, its sex was often determined according to the size of its penis.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, Suzanne (1990). "The Medical Construction of Gender: Case Management of Intersexed Infants". ''Signs'', Vol. 16, No. 1: 3-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even if the sex/gender distinction holds, Lorber and Kessler suggest that the dichotomies of female/male and masculine/feminine are not themselves exhaustive. Lorber writes, "My perspective goes beyond accepted feminist views that gender is a cultural overlay that modifies physiological sex differences [...] I am arguing that bodies differ in many ways physiologically, but they are completely transformed by social practices to fit into the salient categories of a society, the most pervasive of which are 'female' and 'male' and 'women' and 'men.'"&lt;ref name="lorber" /&gt;

Moreover, Lorber has alleged that there exists more diversity within the individual categories of sex and gender—female/male and feminine/masculine, respectively—than between them.&lt;ref name="lorber" /&gt; Hence, her fundamental claim is that both sex and gender are social constructions, rather than [[natural kind]]s.

A comparable view has been advanced by Linda Zerilli, who writes regarding [[Monique Wittig]], that she is "critical of the sex/gender dichotomy in much feminist theory because such a dichotomy leaves unquestioned the belief that there is a 'core of nature which resists examination, a relationship excluded from the social in the analysis—a relationship whose characteristic is ineluctability in culture, as well as in nature, and which is the heterosexual relationship.'"&lt;ref&gt;Zerilli, Linda M. G., ''The Trojan Horse of Universalism: Language As a 'War Machine' in the Writings of Monique Wittig'', in Robbins, Bruce, ed., ''The Phantom Public Sphere'' (Minneapolis, Minn.: Univ. of Minn. Press, 1993 ({{ISBN|0-8166-2124-1}})), pp.&amp;nbsp;153–154 (n.&amp;nbsp;35 (citing Wittig, Monique, ''The Straight Mind'', in ''Feminist Issues'', vol. 1, no. 1, Summer, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;107) omitted) (author asst. prof., poli. sci. dep't, Rutgers Univ., &amp; ed. teaches, Eng. dep't, Rutgers Univ., &amp; coeditor, ''Social Text'') (em-dash surrounded by half-spaces in original).&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Butler also criticizes the sex/gender distinction. Discussing sex as biological fact causes sex to appear natural and politically neutral. However, she argues that "the ostensibly natural facts of sex [are] discursively produced in the service of other political and social interests." Butler concludes, "If the immutable character of sex is contested, perhaps this construct called 'sex' is as culturally constructed as gender; indeed, perhaps it was always already gender, with the consequence that the distinction between sex and gender turns out to be no distinction at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Judith|title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|date=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=9–11|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10493">The term '''she-tragedy''', also known as "''pathetic tragedy''"&lt;ref&gt;The Ravishing Restoration: Aphra Behn, Violence, and Comedy  By Ann Marie Stewart&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a vogue in the late 17th and early 18th centuries for tragic plays focused on the sufferings of a woman, sometimes innocent and virtuous but often a woman who has committed some sort of sexual sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canfield|first=J. Douglas|title=The Broadview Anthology of Restoration and Early Eighteenth-Century Drama|year=2001|publisher=Broadview Press|isbn=9781551112701}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominent she-tragedies include [[Thomas Otway]]'s ''[[The Orphan (play)|The Orphan]]'' (1680), [[John Banks (playwright)|John Banks]]' ''[[Virtue Betrayed, or, Anna Bullen]]'' (1682), [[Thomas Southerne]]'s ''[[The Fatal Marriage]]'' (1694) and [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]]'s ''[[The Fair Penitent]]'' (1703) and ''[[Lady Jane Grey (play)|Lady Jane Grey]]'' (1715). Rowe was the first to use the term "she-tragedy," in 1714.

== Overview ==
When English drama was reborn in 1660 with the re-opening of the theatres, the leading tragic style was the male-dominated [[heroic drama]] which celebrated powerful, aggressively [[masculinity|masculine]] heroes and their pursuit of glory, as rulers and conquerors as well as lovers. In the 1670s and 1680s, a gradual shift occurred from [[heroic]] to [[pathos|pathetic]] tragedy, where the subject was love and domestic concerns, even though the main characters might be public figures. After the phenomenal success of [[Elizabeth Barry]] in moving the audience to tears in the role of Monimia in Otway's ''The Orphan'', she-tragedy became the dominant form of pathetic tragedy and remained highly popular for nearly half a century.

The realm of pathetic tragedy became an exploration of the female experience as the private female sphere, that of the domestic, was put on the stage and publicized. The she-tragedies demonstrated the psychology and behavior of women in their private sphere and presented it for public consideration, a new concept that emerged as women began to star in main roles instead of only supporting characters. For the first time, plays were written that had a woman as the main character and that followed her experiences and emotions. She-tragedies brought what was once solely internal (emotions and thoughts) out for external display. The rise of pathetic tragedy commodified the female experience and women themselves with the transition from men (dressed as women) playing the female roles to women acting on the stage themselves. Actresses, while not unusual in Continental Europe, were just beginning to be accepted as a novelty by the predominantly male audience. The idea of the woman, occupier of the private sphere, as a public figure was bizarre. As a result, actresses often had a bad moral reputation as before the Restoration, public women were immoral women. However, royal sanction gave actresses more opportunities and opened the way for new dramatic possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howe|first=Elizabeth|title='The First English Actresses: Women and Drama 1660&amp;ndash;1700'|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge: Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42210-9|pages=19, 25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components of She-tragedy ==
She tragedies are known for having focused on the hardships of women rather than those suffered by men. A she-tragedy during the 1680s derived its power from the ability to create titillating scenes that portrayed the suffering of an innocent woman.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, Deborahh Payne (2000). The Cambridge companion to English Restoration Theatre. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Pathetic tragedies would begin by presenting the heroine and establishing that she was desirable. Unlike the other popular new genre, horror, the she-tragedy did not depend on violence and gore to become the spectacle of the heroine but rather used the physical suffering that was inflicted on the blameless female victims.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, Jean I (2006). Fatal Desire: Women, Sexuality, and the English Stage, 1660-1720. Cornell University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8014-4447-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women, who were the subject of the play, would usually become victims of adversity and crimes that sexually exploited them such as rape or unsolicited adultery. During the scenes of rape the woman would be abducted and carried off stage. The act of rape, or adultery, would be conveyed to the audience by screams from the woman as the villain completed the evil deed. After the scene the woman would return onstage. Evidences of ravished womanhood such as disheveled hair, disordered clothing, and phallic dagger were trademark of Restoration rape and prominent in she-tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, Deborahh Payne (2000). The Cambridge companion to English Restoration Theatre. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Playwrights would utilize other ill fortune such as the loss of a husband or child and a single mother's struggle to raise her children as another means of causing hardship in the heroine's life. After suffering these hardships throughout the play the female protagonist would be overcome by madness, commit suicide or murder as a result of the burden with which she had suffered.&lt;ref&gt;Owen, Susan J. (2001). A Companion to Restoration Drama. Blackwell Publishers. {{ISBN|0-631-21923-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of a she-tragedy was dependent upon the emotion that the actress conveyed to the audience, but the emotion that the audience felt as they watched the performance. She-tragedy also focused on making the heroine and not the hero the focus of the play. Attention would be placed on the female actress and her sexuality as playwrights used specific dialogue and devices to focus on the sexuality of the woman. One example of this is seen in The Orphan by Otway. In a scene Monimia is accompanied by a page who states to her 
"''Madam, Indeed I'd serve you with my soul;
But n the morning when you call me to you
As by your bed I stand and tell you stories,
I am asham'd to see your swelling Breasts, 
It makes me blush, they are so very white''." (1.221-25)
Here Otway is directing the audience's eyes to the actress' breasts, making her the focal point, and also sexualizing the actress and the character of Monima.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, Jean I (2006). Fatal Desire: Women, Sexuality, and the English Stage, 1660-1720. Cornell University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8014-4447-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in Political Propaganda ==
While she-tragedies were highly entertaining to the public, playwrights would also use them to voice political opinions. In Rowe's ''Jane Grey'' the character Jane represents a symbol of virtue whose desires are second to the political good. During the 1690s the rape in she-tragedies leaned towards Whig beliefs and became a symbol for the justification for displacing proper rule.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, Jean I (2006). Fatal Desire: Women, Sexuality, and the English Stage, 1660-1720. Cornell University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8014-4447-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spectacle of rape within the tragedy was used to convey the belief that the sexual assault on the female victim was a visual representation of assault on the subjects' liberties.

== Actresses and Royal Support ==
One reason that the Carolinian court was more accepting of the addition of women to the world of theater was the experience of the new monarch, Charles II, before he ascended to the throne.  As part of the English Civil War, the previous monarch, Charles II's father Charles I, was executed, sending his sons into exile. Charles II spent much of his exile abroad in France, living as part of the French court and learning French tastes and manners. Although practically unheard of in England, it was not uncommon for women to take part in French and Italian theater, which Charles II would have been exposed to. As a result, when he returned to England, Charles II did not have the same qualms as his countrymen when it came to the more public presence of women.

In addition, in 1662, a law was passed that women's roles were to be played by women and no longer by men. It is speculated that this change was at least partially due to the influence of the Puritans, who "took offence" &lt;ref&gt;The First English Actresses: Women and Drama, 1660-1700&lt;/ref&gt; at men cross-dressing to play women, something that goes against a verse from Deuteronomy in the Old Testament. Ironically, this attempt to reclaim morality in theater led to further scandals as the practice of "breeches roles" developed. These were roles played by woman while wearing men's clothing, either as part of a disguise required by the script or to give the actresses more license to behave as society allowed men to. These roles, while part of elaborate  plot, were sometimes used to exploit the physical aspects of women as men's clothing did not disguise the body's form as much as the dresses traditionally worn by women.

== Women In Tragedy ==
The new focus on women in tragedy may be linked with a growing political disillusion with the old [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] ideology and its traditional masculine ideals (see Staves). Other possible explanations for the great interest in she-tragedy are the popularity of [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], who often ruled alone in the 1690s while her husband [[William III of England|William III]] was on the [[Continental Europe|Continent]], and the publication of ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', the first periodical aimed at women. Elizabeth Howe has argued that the most important explanation for the shift in taste was the emergence of tragic actresses whose popularity made it unavoidable for dramatists to create major roles for them. With the conjunction of the playwright "master of pathos" Thomas Otway and the great tragedienne Elizabeth Barry in ''The Orphan'', the focus shifted decisively from hero to heroine.

'''Junior Philippine Institute of Industrial Engineers''' or '''JPIIE''' (former name: Society of Industrial Engineering) is an [[academic organization]] based in [[University of Perpetual Help System DALTA - Calamba Campus]] exclusive for BS [[Industrial Engineering]] students, faculty and alumni of the said university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uphsdsie.webs.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831233320/http://uphsdsie.webs.com/ |archivedate=2011-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the seven student organizations under the College of Engineering of the university which includes MES (Mechanical Engineering Society) for BS [[Mechanical Engineering]] students and ACES ([[Association of Civil Engineering]] Students) for BS [[Civil Engineering]] among others. The organization is also a member of PIIE (Philippine Institute of Industrial Engineers),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://piie.org/aboutus.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820043857/http://www.piie.org/aboutus.htm |archivedate=2009-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a premier organization of BS Industrial Engineering graduates and students, and IE professionals in the [[Philippines]]. Engr. Philip Ermita, PIE, ASEAN Engr. is the organization's adviser aside from being the Dean of Collge of Engineering in the university.

== History ==
The society was first recognized by the university and its school director-then Rey Dalde in 2002 on the month of August with the efforts of its first student officers for the school year 2002-2003 (June 2002-March 2003) being headed by their president-then, Maria Fe dela Cruz.
The society's [[by-laws]] has been written mainly by Cherryl C. Marudo. According to the by-laws, the name of the organization is Society of Industrial Engineering Students (or SIES). But, for some reasons, it became locally known as SIE (without the second S which means Students) probably because its name structure has been compared to the university's College of Engineering.
Aside from SIE, the society is also known in the acronym UPHSDSIE, with UPHSD, the university's acronym just to know that the society is in that said university. But still, SIE would do.
By the year 2016, the SIE renamed as the Junior Philippine Institute of Industrial Engineers or JPIIE.

'''Special sciences''' are those sciences other than [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]], that are presumed to be [[reductionism|reducible]] to fundamental physics, at least in principle. In this view, [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[neuroscience]]—indeed, all sciences except fundamental physics—are special sciences.  The status of the special sciences, and their relation to physics, is unresolved in the [[philosophy of science]]. [[Jerry Fodor]], for instance, has argued for ''strong autonomy'', concluding that the special sciences are not even in principle reducible to physics.&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, J. (1974): "Special sciences and the disunity of science as a working hypothesis", ''Synthese'', 28, pp. 97-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1899, university professors from around Canada came to St. Andrews over the summer months to do field research work at Canada’s first marine biological station, which, at the time, was a floating scow.&lt;ref name="PhotoAlbum2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mar.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/e0006539|title=SABS Photo Album|date=2010-11-29|publisher=Fisheries and Oceans Canada|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, permanent installations of the biological station were established with the main laboratory, a residence building, and an attic.&lt;ref name="pipsc.ca" /&gt; There were long working tables, and storage area for materials and supplies. Dr. [[Archibald Gowanlock Huntsman]] was the Curator from 1912 to 1921 and Director from 1921 until 1933. The main lab was destroyed by fire in 1932 and replaced the following year by a fireproof lab, part of the complex that houses the SABS' library.&lt;ref name="PhotoAlbum2010" /&gt; After establishing the first freshwater biological research station in Canada at [[Gimli, Manitoba]] in 1929, the fisheries biologist Alexander Dimitrivitch Bajkov came to work at SABS in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="mhs.mb.ca2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/bajkov_ad.shtml|title=Memorable Manitobans: Alexander Dimitrivitch Bajkov (1895-1955)|date=5 May 2009|work=mhs.mb.ca|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a contract was awarded to construct a new [[wet laboratory]] building through consolidation of existing buildings into one state of the art wet lab facility that will house the majority of marine life and research operations; completion is expected by June 2012.&lt;ref name="news.gc.ca2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-eng.do?crtr.sj1D=&amp;mthd=advSrch&amp;crtr.mnthndVl=12&amp;nid=445369|title=Modernization of the St. Andrews Biological Station continues with a contract for construction of new wet laboratory|date=April 24, 2009|publisher=Canada News Centre|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
The station's research includes aquaculture, oceanography, the sustainability of fisheries, stock assessments, aquatic environment, species at risk, and the biology of commercially harvested fish. SABS maintains a reservoir.&lt;ref name="reliablepower.ca" /&gt; It provides several services such as saltwater, freshwater and chemistry labs; quarantine water and marine fish rearing facilities; and [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]].

'''Stigmatic-eligibilic paraphilias''' are desires whose objects "become eligible" to be desired ''because of'', rather than ''despite'', a [[social stigma|stigma]] which they bear. The manifold manifestations of these [[paraphilia]]s cover the broadest range of physical, intimate and social circumstance. 

In the context of a stigmatic-eligibilic paraphilia, what is considered repulsive, unsuitable, prohibited, abnormal or taboo by most people turns into something attractive, suitable, permitted, normal and licensed. Thus, in [[paedophilia]], [[necrophilia]] and [[zoophilia]], children, corpses and animals are desired despite being incapable of forming sexual (or, indeed, any) relationships. In the [[attraction to disability]], disabled people are desired despite deviating from the physical standard. In [[gerontophilia]] and [[ephebophilia]], significantly older or younger people are desired despite being generally considered unsuitable due to great difference in age. In [[hybristophilia]], notorious criminals are desired despite being generally considered objectionable. In [[urolagnia]], [[coprophilia]] and [[emetophilia]], urinating, defecating and vomiting in intimate circumstances are seen as arousing despite the general views that they are repulsive. In this sense, stigmatic-eligibilic paraphilias can seem 'non-conformist' and 'taboo-busting.'

Stigmatic-eligibilic paraphilias are generally thought to result from intense and memorable childhood experiences ("[[sexuoerotic tragedy|sexuoerotic tragedies]]," though they may not be distressing) which "deform" the future adult's idea of what is and what is not attractive (their "[[lovemap]]"). Attempting to accommodate the extraordinary experience into an acceptable mental frame of reference, the future adult may "triumph" over it by use of a logic whereby the terms of reference commonly associated with it are reversed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35133">'''Stream processing''' is a [[computer programming]] paradigm, equivalent to [[dataflow programming]], [[event stream processing]], and [[reactive programming]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jonathanbeard.io/blog/2015/09/19/streaming-and-dataflow.html A SHORT INTRO TO STREAM PROCESSING]&lt;/ref&gt; that allows some applications to more easily exploit a limited form of [[parallel computing|parallel processing]]. Such applications can use multiple computational units, such as the [[floating point unit]] on a [[graphics processing unit]] or [[field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGAs),&lt;ref&gt;[http://icims.csl.illinois.edu/~dchen/research/SASP09_FCUDA.pdf FCUDA: Enabling Efficient Compilation of CUDA Kernels onto FPGAs]&lt;/ref&gt; without explicitly managing allocation, synchronization, or communication among those units.

The stream processing paradigm simplifies parallel software and hardware by restricting the parallel computation that can be performed. Given a sequence of data (a ''stream''), a series of operations (''[[compute kernel|kernel functions]]'') is applied to each element in the stream. Kernel functions are usually [[pipeline (computing)|pipelined]], and optimal local on-chip memory reuse is attempted, in order to minimize the loss in bandwidth, accredited to external memory interaction. ''Uniform streaming'', where one kernel function is applied to all elements in the stream, is typical. Since the kernel and stream abstractions expose data dependencies, compiler tools can fully automate and optimize on-chip management tasks. Stream processing hardware can use [[scoreboarding]], for example, to initiate a [[direct memory access]] (DMA) when dependencies become known. The elimination of manual DMA management reduces software complexity, and an associated elimination for hardware cached I/O, reduces the data area expanse that has to be involved with service by specialized computational units such as [[arithmetic logic unit]]s.

During the 1980s stream processing was explored within [[dataflow programming]]. An example is the language [[SISAL]] (Streams and Iteration in a Single Assignment Language).

== Applications ==
Stream processing is essentially a compromise, driven by a data-centric model that works very well for traditional DSP or GPU-type applications (such as image, video and [[digital signal processing]]) but less so for general purpose processing with more randomized data access (such as databases). By sacrificing some flexibility in the model, the implications allow easier, faster and more efficient execution.  Depending on the context, [[central processing unit|processor]] design may be tuned for maximum efficiency or a trade-off for flexibility.

Stream processing is especially suitable for applications that exhibit three application characteristics:{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}
* '''Compute Intensity''', the number of arithmetic operations per I/O or global memory reference.  In many signal processing applications today it is well over 50:1 and increasing with algorithmic complexity.
* '''Data Parallelism''' exists in a kernel if the same function is applied to all records of an input stream and a number of records can be processed simultaneously without waiting for results from previous records.
* '''Data Locality''' is a specific type of temporal locality common in signal and media processing applications where data is produced once, read once or twice later in the application, and never read again. Intermediate streams passed between kernels as well as intermediate data within kernel functions can capture this locality directly using the stream processing programming model.

Examples of records within streams include:
* In graphics, each record might be the vertex, normal, and color information for a triangle;
* In image processing, each record might be a single pixel from an image;
* In a video encoder, each record may be 256 pixels forming a macroblock of data; or
* In wireless signal processing, each record could be a sequence of samples received from an antenna.

For each record we can only read from the input, perform operations on it, and write to the output. It is permissible to have multiple inputs and multiple outputs, but never a piece of memory that is both readable and writable. &lt;!-- We could discuss weeks on whatever this can be considered generally true by pointing out the implications of the exact wording. --&gt;

== Comparison to prior parallel paradigms ==
Basic computers started from a sequential execution paradigm. Traditional [[Central processing unit|CPUs]] are [[SISD]] based, which means they conceptually perform only one operation at a time.
As the computing needs of the world evolved, the amount of data to be managed increased very quickly. It was obvious that the sequential programming model could not cope with the increased need for processing power. Various efforts have been spent on finding alternative ways to perform massive amounts of computations but the only solution was to exploit some level of parallel execution.
The result of those efforts was [[SIMD]], a programming paradigm which allowed applying one instruction to multiple instances of (different) data. Most of the time, SIMD was being used in a [[SWAR]] environment. By using more complicated structures, one could also have [[MIMD]] parallelism.

Although those two paradigms were efficient, real-world implementations were plagued with limitations from memory alignment problems to synchronization issues and limited parallelism. Only few SIMD processors survived as stand-alone components; most were embedded in standard CPUs.

Consider a simple program adding up two arrays containing 100 4-component [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]] (i.e. 400 numbers in total).

=== Conventional, sequential paradigm ===
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100 * 4; i++)
    result[i] = source0[i] + source1[i];
&lt;/source&gt;
This is the sequential paradigm that is most familiar. Variations do exist (such as inner loops, structures and such), but they ultimately boil down to that construct.

===Parallel SIMD paradigm, packed registers (SWAR)===
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
for (int el = 0; el &lt; 100; el++) // for each vector
    vector_sum(result[el], source0[el], source1[el]);
&lt;/source&gt;
This is actually oversimplified. It assumes the instruction &lt;code&gt;vector_sum&lt;/code&gt; works. Although this is what happens with [[Intrinsic function|instruction intrinsics]], much information is actually not taken into account here such as the number of vector components and their data format. This is done for clarity.

You can see however, this method reduces the number of decoded instructions from ''numElements * componentsPerElement'' to ''numElements''. The number of jump instructions is also decreased, as the loop is run fewer times. These gains result from the parallel execution of the four mathematical operations.

What happened however is that the packed SIMD register holds a certain amount of data so it's not possible to get more parallelism. The speed up is somewhat limited by the assumption we made of performing four parallel operations (please note this is common for both [[AltiVec]] and [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]]).

===Parallel Stream paradigm (SIMD/MIMD)===
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
// This is a fictional language for demonstration purposes.
elements = array streamElement([number, number])[100]
kernel = instance streamKernel("@arg0[@iter]")
result = kernel.invoke(elements)
&lt;/source&gt;
In this paradigm, the whole dataset is defined, rather than each component block being defined separately. Describing the set of data is assumed to be in the first two rows. After that, the result is inferred from the sources and kernel. For simplicity, there's a 1:1 mapping between input and output data but this does not need to be. Applied kernels can also be much more complex.

An implementation of this paradigm can "unroll" a loop internally. This allows throughput to scale with chip complexity, easily utilizing hundreds of ALUs.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits:[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4443192 "A Programmable 512 GOPS Stream Processor for Signal, Image, and Video Processing"], Stanford University and Stream Processors, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khailany, Dally, Rixner, Kapasi, Owens and Towles: [http://cva.stanford.edu/publications/2003/khailany_im_scalability.pdf  "Exploring VLSI Scalability of Stream Processors"], Stanford and Rice University.&lt;/ref&gt; The elimination of complex data patterns makes much of this extra power available.

While stream processing is a branch of SIMD/MIMD processing, they must not be confused. Although SIMD implementations can often work in a "streaming" manner, their performance is not comparable: the model envisions a very different usage pattern which allows far greater performance by itself.

It has been noted that when applied on generic processors such as standard CPU, only a 1.5x speedup can be reached.&lt;ref&gt;Gummaraju and Rosenblum, [http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/skeckler/wild04/Paper14.pdf  "Stream processing in General-Purpose Processors"], Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, ad-hoc stream processors easily reach over 10x performance, mainly attributed to the more efficient memory access and higher levels of parallel processing.&lt;ref&gt;Kapasi, Dally, Rixner, Khailany, Owens, Ahn and Mattson, [http://cva.stanford.edu/publications/2003/ieeecomputer_stream.pdf "Programmable Stream Processors"], Universities of Stanford, Rice, California (Davis) and Reservoir Labs.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are various degrees of flexibility allowed by the model, stream processors usually impose some limitations on the kernel or stream size. For example, consumer hardware often lacks the ability to perform high-precision math, lacks complex indirection chains or presents lower limits on the number of instructions which can be executed.

[[AT&amp;T]] also researched stream-enhanced processors as [[graphics processing unit]]s rapidly evolved in both speed and functionality.{{ref|GPUasSTREAM}} Since these early days, dozens of stream processing languages have been developed, as well as specialized hardware.

=== Programming model notes ===
The most immediate challenge in the realm of parallel processing does not lie as much in the type of hardware architecture used, but in how easy it will be to program the system in question in a real-world environment with acceptable performance. Machines like Imagine use a straightforward single-threaded model with automated dependencies, memory allocation and [[Direct memory access|DMA]] scheduling. This in itself is a result of the research at MIT and Stanford in finding an optimal ''layering of tasks'' between programmer, tools and hardware. Programmers beat tools in mapping algorithms to parallel hardware, and tools beat programmers in figuring out smartest memory allocation schemes, etc. Of particular concern are MIMD designs such as [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell]], for which the programmer needs to deal with application partitioning across multiple cores and deal with process synchronization and load balancing. Efficient multi-core programming tools are severely lacking today.

A drawback of SIMD programming was the issue of [[Array-of-Structures (AoS) and Structure-of-Arrays (SoA)]]. Programmers often wanted to build data structures with a 'real' meaning, for example:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
 // A particle in a three-dimensional space.
struct particle_t {
    float x, y, z;          // not even an array!
    unsigned byte color[3]; // 8 bit per channel, say we care about RGB only
    float size;
    // ... and many other attributes may follow...
};
&lt;/source&gt;
What happened is that those structures were then assembled in [[Array data structure|arrays]] to keep things nicely organized. This is ''[[array of structures]]'' (AoS).
When the structure is laid out in memory, the compiler will produce interleaved data, in the sense that all the structures will be contiguous but there will be a constant offset between, say, the "size" attribute of a structure instance and the same element of the following instance. The offset depends on the structure definition (and possibly other things not considered here such as compiler's policies).
There are also other problems. For example, the three position variables cannot be SIMD-ized that way, because it's not sure they will be allocated in continuous memory space. To make sure SIMD operations can work on them, they shall be grouped in a 'packed memory location' or at least in an array.
Another problem lies in both "color" and "xyz" to be defined in three-component vector quantities. SIMD processors usually have support for 4-component operations only (with some exceptions however).

These kinds of problems and limitations made SIMD acceleration on standard CPUs quite nasty.
The proposed solution, ''[[structure of arrays]]'' (SoA) follows as:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
struct particle_t {
    float *x, *y, *z;
    unsigned byte *colorRed, *colorBlue, *colorGreen;
    float *size;
};
&lt;/source&gt;
For readers not experienced with [[C (programming language)|C]], the '*' before each identifier means a pointer. In this case, they will be used to point to the first element of an array, which is to be allocated later. For [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programmers, this is roughly equivalent to "[]".
The drawback here is that the various attributes could be spread in memory. To make sure this does not cause cache misses, we'll have to update all the various "reds", then all the "greens" and "blues".

For stream processors, the usage of structures is encouraged. From an application point of view, all the attributes can be defined with some flexibility.
Taking GPUs as reference, there is a set of attributes (at least 16) available. For each attribute, the application can state the number of components and the format of the components (but only primitive data types are supported for now). The various attributes are then attached to a memory block, possibly defining a ''stride'' between 'consecutive' elements of the same attributes, effectively allowing interleaved data.
When the GPU begins the stream processing, it will ''gather'' all the various attributes in a single set of parameters (usually this looks like a structure or a "magic global variable"), performs the operations and ''scatters'' the results to some memory area for later processing (or retrieving).

More modern stream processing frameworks provide a FIFO like interface to structure data as a literal stream. This abstraction 
provides a means to specify data dependencies implicitly while enabling the runtime/hardware to take full advantage of that 
knowledge for efficient computation. One of the simplest and most efficient stream processing modalities to date for C++, 
is [[RaftLib]]. [[RaftLib]] enables linking independent [[compute kernel]]s together as a data flow graph using C++ stream operators. 
As an example:
&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
#include &lt;raft&gt;
#include &lt;raftio&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

class hi : public raft::kernel
{
public:
    hi() : raft::kernel()
    {
       output.addPort&lt; std::string &gt;( "0" ); 
    }

    virtual raft::kstatus run()
    {
        output[ "0" ].push( std::string( "Hello World\n" ) );
        return( raft::stop ); 
    }
};

int
main( int argc, char **argv )
{
    /** instantiate print kernel **/
    raft::print&lt; std::string &gt; p;
    /** instantiate hello world kernel **/
    hi hello;
    /** make a map object **/
    raft::map m;
    /** add kernels to map, both hello and p are executed concurrently **/
    m += hello &gt;&gt; p;
    /** execute the map **/
    m.exe();
    return( EXIT_SUCCESS );
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Models of computation for stream processing ===
Apart from specifying streaming applications in high-level language. Models of computation (MoCs) also have been widely used such as [[dataflow]] models and process-based models.

=== Generic processor architecture ===
Historically, CPUs began implementing various tiers of memory access optimizations because of the ever-increasing performance when compared to relatively slow growing external memory bandwidth. As this gap widened, big amounts of die area were dedicated to hiding memory latencies. Since fetching information and opcodes to those few ALUs is expensive, very little die area is dedicated to actual mathematical machinery (as a rough estimation, consider it to be less than 10%).

A similar architecture exists on stream processors but thanks to the new programming model, the amount of transistors dedicated to management is actually very little.

Beginning from a whole system point of view, stream processors usually exist in a controlled environment. GPUs do exist on an add-in board (this seems to also apply to [http://cva.stanford.edu/projects/imagine/ Imagine]). CPUs do the dirty job of managing system resources, running applications and such.

The stream processor is usually equipped with a fast, efficient, proprietary memory bus (crossbar switches are now common, multi-buses have been employed in the past). The exact amount of memory lanes is dependent on the market range. As this is written, there are still 64-bit wide interconnections around (entry-level). Most mid-range models use a fast 128-bit crossbar switch matrix (4 or 2 segments), while high-end models deploy huge amounts of memory (actually up to 512&amp;nbsp;MB) with a slightly slower crossbar that is 256 bits wide. By contrast, standard processors from [[Intel Pentium]] to some [[Athlon 64]] have only a single 64-bit wide data bus.

Memory access patterns are much more predictable. While arrays do exist, their dimension is fixed at kernel invocation. The thing which most closely matches a multiple pointer indirection is an ''indirection chain'', which is however guaranteed to finally read or write from a specific memory area (inside a stream).

Because of the SIMD nature of the stream processor's execution units (ALUs clusters), read/write operations are expected to happen in bulk, so memories are optimized for high bandwidth rather than low latency (this is a difference from [[Rambus]] and [[DDR SDRAM]], for example). This also allows for efficient memory bus negotiations.

Most (90%) of a stream processor's work is done on-chip, requiring only 1% of the global data to be stored to memory. This is where knowing the kernel temporaries and dependencies pays.

Internally, a stream processor features some clever communication and management circuits but what's interesting is the ''Stream Register File'' (SRF). This is conceptually a large cache in which stream data is stored to be transferred to external memory in bulks. As a cache-like software-controlled structure to the various [[arithmetic logic unit|ALUs]], the SRF is shared between all the various ALU clusters. The key concept and innovation here done with Stanford's Imagine chip is that the compiler is able to automate and allocate memory in an optimal way, fully transparent to the programmer. The dependencies between kernel functions and data is known through the programming model which enables the compiler to perform flow analysis and optimally pack the SRFs. Commonly, this cache and DMA management can take up the majority of a project's schedule, something the stream processor (or at least Imagine) totally automates. Tests done at Stanford showed that the compiler did an as well or better job at scheduling memory than if you hand tuned the thing with much effort.

There is proof; there can be a lot of clusters because inter-cluster communication is assumed to be rare. Internally however, each cluster can efficiently exploit a much lower amount of ALUs because intra-cluster communication is common and thus needs to be highly efficient.

To keep those ALUs fetched with data, each ALU is equipped with local register files (LRFs), which are basically its usable registers.

This three-tiered data access pattern, makes it easy to keep temporary data away from slow memories, thus making the silicon implementation highly efficient and power-saving.

=== Hardware-in-the-loop issues ===
{{Confusing section|date=January 2008}} &lt;!-- In a revision (as of 07:40, 8 January 2008) an user noted this was considered not relevant. Since those issues are slightly covered in the references, it seems they are. Most of the statements here can be inferred from the references while others are simply involved in using PCIe transactions (so referencing them here doesn't seem a wise idea) - keeping the tag anyway to gain more attention. --&gt;
Although an order of magnitude speedup can be reasonably expected (even from mainstream GPUs when computing in a streaming manner), not all applications benefit from this.
Communication latencies are actually the biggest problem. Although [[PCI Express]] improved this with full-duplex communications, getting a GPU (and possibly a generic stream processor) to work will possibly take long amounts of time. This means it's usually counter-productive to use them for small datasets. Because changing the kernel is a rather expensive operation the stream architecture also incurs penalties for small streams, a behaviour referred to as the ''short stream effect''.

[[Instruction pipeline|Pipelining]] is a very widespread and heavily used practice on stream processors, with GPUs featuring pipelines exceeding 200 stages. The cost for switching settings is dependent on the setting being modified but it is now considered to always be expensive. To avoid those problems at various levels of the pipeline, many techniques have been deployed such as "über shaders" and "texture atlases". Those techniques are game-oriented because of the nature of GPUs, but the concepts are interesting for generic stream processing as well.

== Examples ==
* The [[Blitter]] in the Commodore [[Amiga]] is an early (circa 1985) graphics processor capable of combining three source streams of 16 component bit vectors in 256 ways to produce an output stream consisting of 16 component bit vectors. Total input stream bandwidth is up to 42 million bits per second. Output stream bandwidth is up to 28 million bits per second.
* Imagine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cva.stanford.edu/projects/imagine/ Imagine]&lt;/ref&gt; headed by Professor [[Bill Dally|William Dally]] of [[Stanford University]], is a flexible architecture intended to be both fast and energy efficient. The project, originally conceived in 1996, included architecture, software tools, a VLSI implementation and a development board, was funded by [[DARPA]], [[Intel]] and [[Texas Instruments]].
* Another [[Stanford]] project, called Merrimac,&lt;ref&gt;[http://merrimac.stanford.edu/ Merrimac]&lt;/ref&gt; is aimed at developing a stream-based supercomputer.  Merrimac intends to use a stream architecture and advanced interconnection networks to provide more performance per unit cost than cluster-based scientific computers built from the same technology.
* The '''Storm-1''' family from [[Stream Processors, Inc]], a commercial spin-off of Stanford's '''Imagine''' project,  was announced during a feature presentation at [[ISSCC]] 2007.  The family contains four members ranging from 30 GOPS to 220 16-bit GOPS (billions of operations per second), all fabricated at [[TSMC]] in a 130 nanometer process.  The devices target the high end of the [[digital signal processor|DSP]] market including [[video conferencing]], [[multifunction printer]]s and digital [[video surveillance]] equipment.
* [[GPU]]s are widespread, consumer-grade stream processors{{ref|GPUasSTREAM}} designed mainly by [[AMD]] and [[Nvidia]]. Various generations to be noted from a stream processing point of view:
** Pre-R2xx/NV2x: no explicit support for stream processing. Kernel operations were hidden in the [[API]] and provided too little flexibility for general use.
** R2xx/NV2x: kernel stream operations became explicitly under the programmer's control but only for vertex processing (fragments were still using old paradigms). No branching support severely hampered flexibility but some types of algorithms could be run (notably, low-precision fluid simulation).
** R3xx/NV4x: flexible branching support although some limitations still exist on the number of operations to be executed and strict recursion depth, as well as array manipulation.
** R8xx: Supports append/consume buffers and atomic operations. This generation is the state of the art.&lt;!-- What does this mean? It means it's a TODO. Remember we should track functionalities here rather than performance improvements. --&gt;
* [[AMD FireStream]] brand name for product line targeting HPC
* [[Nvidia Tesla]] brand name for product line targeting HPC
* The [[Cell processor]] from '''STI''', an alliance of [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], [[Toshiba Corporation]], and [[IBM]], is a hardware architecture that can function like a stream processor with appropriate software support.  It consists of a controlling processor, the PPE (Power Processing Element, an IBM [[PowerPC]]) and a set of SIMD coprocessors, called SPEs (Synergistic Processing Elements), each with independent program counters and instruction memory, in effect a [[MIMD]] machine. In the native programming model all DMA and program scheduling is left up to the programmer. The hardware provides a fast ring bus among the processors for local communication. Because the local memory for instructions and data is limited the only programs that can exploit this architecture effectively either require a tiny memory footprint or adhere to a stream programming model.  With a suitable algorithm the performance of the Cell can rival that of pure stream processors, however this nearly always requires a complete redesign of algorithms and software.

After seven episodes of declining ratings,&lt;ref name="bandc"/&gt; CBS moved the show's US airing to Fridays, swapping with ''[[Flashpoint (TV series)|Flashpoint]]'', which had outperformed'' Swingtown'' despite airing in a less favorable time slot.  ''Swingtown's'' first season's finale (ultimately the ''de facto'' series finale) aired on September 5.

Although the show's cancellation was suspected well in advance, it was made official on January 14, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/articles/swingtown-cbs-finally-officially-cancels-the-1970s-tv-show/ |title=''Swingtown'' CBS (Finally) Officially Cancels the 1970s TV Show |publisher=TVSeriesFinale.com |accessdate=2009-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090122042735/http://tvseriesfinale.com/articles/swingtown-cbs-finally-officially-cancels-the-1970s-tv-show/ |archivedate=2009-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/tca-cbs-says-swingtown-not-coming-back-33963|title=TCA: CBS Says Swingtown Not Coming Back| publisher=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]| accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
Set in the summer of 1976, the series begins with the relocation of the Miller family to a more affluent neighborhood in the [[North Shore (Chicago)|North Shore]], a suburban area of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]. Bruce Miller (played by [[Jack Davenport]]) is a futures trader working his way up in the business, married to Susan ([[Molly Parker]]). Susan Miller is a homemaker who got pregnant and married Bruce in high school. The couple have a teenage daughter, Laurie ([[Shanna Collins]]), and a young son Bruce Junior, nicknamed B.J. (Aaron Howles).

Tom and Trina Decker ([[Grant Show]] and [[Lana Parrilla]]) are the Millers' new neighbors. Tom, an airline [[aviator|pilot]], met Trina while she was a [[stewardess]]. The Deckers quickly befriend the Millers, and the Millers just as quickly learn that their new neighbors have an [[open marriage]].  The move strains the Millers' friendship with Roger and Janet Thompson ([[Josh Hopkins]] and [[Miriam Shor]]), their more conservative neighbors and friends from their old neighborhood. They try to maintain their friendship with the Millers, but the Thompsons are appalled when they learn about the Deckers' marital arrangement.  The Thompsons have a son, Rick ([[Nick Benson]]).

Although the show mostly focuses on the three couples, their children's stories are followed too, particularly Laurie, who is attracted to her summer school philosophy teacher ([[Michael Rady]]).  B.J. and Rick's friendship is also tested by the move, and B.J. meets Samantha Saxton ([[Brittany Robertson]]), an enigmatic girl who lives next door to him in his new neighborhood.

==Pre-production==
Producers [[Mike Kelley (writer)|Mike Kelley]] ([[head writer]]) and  [[Alan Poul]] first pitched their idea to [[Home Box Office|HBO]], where Poul, who had worked on ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', had a development deal.   Poul said HBO passed on the opportunity at least in part because it already had ''[[Big Love]]'' in production and ''[[Tell Me You Love Me (TV series)|Tell Me You Love Me]]'' in development.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;  The two next approached [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], but before discussions with that network went anywhere, CBS Entertainment president [[Nina Tassler]] found out about the proposal and within a couple of days, had read the script; she gave the series the [[greenlight]] in May 2007.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |author=Jacques Steinberg |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/arts/television/11stei.html?_r=2 |title=Take My Wife.

==Reception==
The 26 critics included in the show's [[Metacritic]] gave it mixed reviews (a "metascore" of 49).  ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said the series "exhibits rare depth" and includes "plenty of nifty touches, from the pop-song score and ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' fashions to the first-rate cast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brian Lowry |url=https://variety.com/2008/scene/markets-festivals/swingtown-1200522018/ |title=Review: 'Swingtown' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2008-05-30 |accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said "even skillful performances by its largely unknown cast aren't able to hide the lack of character development and the sense that the people in this series are almost self-parodies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Barry Garron |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/swingtown-125599 |title=Swingtown |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=2008-06-01 |accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Salon (website)|Salon]] called it "stylish and '70s-sexy but also shallow enough to feel like a less funny, hollowed-out combination of ''[[The Wonder Years]]'' and ''Boogie Nights'' &amp;mdash; which is exactly what the show's creators told the ''New York Times'' they were aiming for (without using the words 'less funny' and 'hollowed-out' of course)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Heather Havrilesky |url=http://www.salon.com/ent/tv/iltw/2008/05/25/swingtown/index.html |title=I Like to Watch |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526040104/http://www.salon.com/ent/tv/iltw/2008/05/25/swingtown/index.html |archivedate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Controversy===
The [[American Family Association]] urged members to write letters of complaint to the media,&lt;ref name="war"&gt;{{cite news |work=The News Tribune (Tacoma, WA) |title=War on ''Swingtown'' |first=Cheryl |last=Tucker |page=3 |date=2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Parents Television Council]] followed a failed [[boycott]] attempt with an effort to convince CBS affiliates to preempt the program.&lt;ref name="gray"&gt;{{cite news |work=Philadelphia Daily News |title=Around the channels, from 'Swingtown' to Disney |first=Ellen |last=Gray |date=2008-06-12 |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Procter &amp; Gamble]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/mediaworks/article?article_id=128184|title=Advertisers Don't Party With CBS's Swingers|publisher=|accessdate=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ace Hardware]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onemillionmoms.com/IssueDetail.asp?id=308 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917141903/http://www.onemillionmoms.com/IssueDetail.asp?id=308 |archivedate=2008-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; stopped advertising on the serial.

Lindsay Soll writes that one "producer thinks of sophisticated swingers Tom and Trina (Show and Parilla) in a ‘''[[Great Gatsby]]''-like way,’ calling them 'the shining couple across the street.'  Exactly why we'd get in bed with them--er, the show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lindsay Soll |title=TV on DVD |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |volume=1026 |page=58 |date=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audience interest dwindled as the summer progressed.  After a strong [[pilot episode]], [[#Ratings|the ratings for ''Swingtown'']] got progressively worse, aided{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} by [[Friday night death slot|a mid-season move from Thursdays to Friday]].

According to executive producer [[Alan Poul]], the first season ending was shot with the show's uncertain future in mind:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Michael Ausiello]] |url=http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2008/08/grant-show-to-g.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080903003946/http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2008/08/grant-show-to-g.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-09-03 |title=Exclusive: ''Private Practice'' Paging Grant Show... |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=2008-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The season ends with a [[cliffhanger]], but it's also a completely satisfying ending.  So, if we go forward, there are many new things that are set up to explore. And if we don't go forward, there's no feeling that we've been left with something incomplete.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The poor ratings led CBS to see if any cable networks, or perhaps [[DirecTV]], were interested in picking it up.&lt;ref name="bandc"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Melissa Grego |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/cbs-paramount-shopping-swingtown-cable-nets/33089 |title=CBS Paramount Shopping ''Swingtown'' to Cable Nets |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |date=2008-08-22 |accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bravo (US TV network)|Bravo]] decided to acquire rights to the existing episodes, but did not order any new ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2009/01/14/cbs-confirms-swingtown-is-cancelled/ |title=CBS Confirms ''Swingtown'' is Cancelled |work=[[TV by the Numbers]] |date=2009-01-14 |accessdate=2014-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2430">In [[computer science]] and [[computer engineering|engineering]], a '''test vector''' is a set of inputs provided to a system in order to test that system.  In [[software development]], test vectors are a methodology of [[software testing]] and [[software verification and validation]]. 

==Rationale==

In computer science and engineering, a system acts as a [[computable function]].  An example of a specific function could be &lt;math&gt;y = f(x)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the output of the system and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the input; however, most systems' inputs are not one-dimensional. When the inputs are multi-dimensional, we could say that the system takes the form &lt;math&gt;y = f(x_1, x_2, ...)&lt;/math&gt; ; however, we can generalize this equation to a general form &lt;math&gt;Y = C(X)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the result of the system's execution, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the set of [[computable function]]s, and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an input vector.  While testing the system, various test vectors must be used to examine the system's behavior with differing inputs.

==Example==
For example, consider a login page with two input fields: a [[username]] field and a [[password]] field. In that case, the login system can be described as:
 
&lt;math&gt;
y = L(u,p)
&lt;/math&gt; 

with &lt;math&gt;y \in \{ true , false \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u,p \in \{ String \}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;true&lt;/math&gt; designating login successful, and &lt;math&gt;false&lt;/math&gt; designating login failure, respectively.

Making things more generic, we can suggest that the function &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; takes input as a 2-dimensional [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] and outputs a one-dimensional vector ([[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]).
This can be written in the following way:-

&lt;math&gt;
Y = L(X)
&lt;/math&gt;

with 
&lt;math&gt;
X = [ x_1, x_2 ]=[u,p] \; ; \; Y = [ y_1 ] 
&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called the input vector, and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is called the output vector.

In order to test the login page, it is necessary to pass some sample input vectors &lt;math&gt;\{X_1, X_2, X_3, ...\}&lt;/math&gt;.  In this context &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; is called a test vector.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2687">A '''top drive''' is a mechanical device on a [[drilling rig]] that provides clockwise torque to the [[drill string]] to drill a [[borehole]]. It is an alternative to the [[rotary table (drilling rig)|rotary table]] and [[kelly drive]]. It is located at the [[swivel (drill rig)|swivel's]] place below the traveling block and moves vertically up and down the derrick.  

The top drive allows the drilling rig to drill the longer section of a stand of [[drill pipe]] in one operation.  A rotary table type rig can only drill {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} (single drill pipe) sections of drill pipe whereas a top drive can drill {{convert|60|-|90|ft|adj=on}} stands (double and triple drill pipe respectively, a triple being three joints of drillpipe screwed together), depending on the drilling rig size.  Handling longer sections of drill pipe enables a drilling rig to make greater daily progress because up to {{convert|90|ft|adj=on}} can be drilled at a time, thus requiring fewer "connections" to add another {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} of drill pipe. Another advantage of top drive systems is time efficiency.  When the bit progresses under a kelly drive, the entire string must be withdrawn from the well bore for the length of the [[Kelly drive|kelly]] in order to add one more length of drill pipe.  With a top drive, the [[Draw-works|draw works]] only has to pick up a new stand from the rack and make up two joints.  Making fewer and quicker connections reduces the risk of a stuck string from annulus clogging while [[drilling fluid]] is not being pumped.  

Several different kinds of top drives exist, and are usually classified based on the "Safe Working Load" (SWL) of the equipment and the size and type of motor used to rotate the drillpipe. For offshore and heavy duty use, a 1000 short ton unit would be used, whereas a smaller land rig may only require a 500 short ton device. Various sizes of hydraulic motors, or AC or DC electric motors, are available.

'''Utopian studies''' is an interdisciplinary field of study that researches utopianism in all its forms, including utopian politics, utopian literature and art, utopian theory, and intentional communities. The term utopia was created by [[Thomas More]] in [[Utopia (book)|a book with the same name]] in 1516.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17938">[[File:William James b1842c.jpg|thumb|right|190px| [[William James]] (1842-1910) c.1890. With his essay ''The Moral Equivalent of War'' he is considered &lt;ref&gt;Aberkane 2010&lt;/ref&gt; one of the fathers of the concept of '''war against war''']]
In [[political philosophy]] and [[international relations]] especially in [[peace and conflict studies]] the concept of a '''war against war''' also known as '''war on war''' refers to the [[Concretization|reification]] of [[armed conflicts]].

==Origin==
[[File:Berlin plaque Ernst Friedrich.jpg|thumb|left|190px| Memorial plaque for [[Ernst Friedrich]] at the 'Antikriegsmuseum' (anti-war museum) in [[Berlin-Mitte]], Germany. One can read the title of Friedrich's book 'Krieg dem kriege"]]
If a work of [[Edmond Potonié-Pierre]] from 1877 already discusses the idea of reifying conflicts under the title "''la guerre à la guerre''" (''the war against war'')&lt;ref&gt;Edmond Pontonié-Pierre ''La Guerre à la Guerre'' 1877&lt;/ref&gt; in its modern acceptation the concept is formally coined in 1906 by [[William James]] in his essay [[s:The Moral Equivalent of War|''The moral equivalent of war'']]. Though also used as a political slogan, it was a cornerstone of the ideology of both the European pre World War I [[Pacifism#World War I|pacifist]] and [[Anti-war movement#World War I|anti-war]] movements in the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;Francis Ludwig Carsten War against war: British and German radical movements in the First World War, University of California Press 1982&lt;/ref&gt; especially in its German version of ''Kriege dem Kriege'' from the eponymous two volume 1925 pamphlet of Ernst Friedrich&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Friederich, Kriege dem Kriege! 2 vol "Freie Jugend", 1925&lt;/ref&gt; which was largely translated across Europe. Prior to World War I the French labour union ''[[Confédération Générale du Travail]]'' pleaded its pacifism under the slogan ''guerre à la guerre!'' which was also the title of a poster campaign by which the French ''[[Association de la Paix par le Droit]]'' recalled the commitments taken by European powers at the [[Hague Convention of 1907]].&lt;ref&gt;"''Guerre à la Guerre!''" ''campagne d'affichage de l'Association pour la Paix par le Droit'' [https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/15801/DBEE72DCADF6B6D8C648CEDA446023D22AC4CED6.html exemplaire d'une affiche disponible à la Bibliothèque Municipale de Lyon, France]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution in the 20th century==
Although the slogan and concept (as the reification of armed conflicts) of ''war against war'' was the subject of an anti-military pleading in 1916 at the [[military tribunal]] of [[Neuchâtel]]&lt;ref&gt;Jules Humbert-Droz ''Guerre à la guerre: à bas l'armée : plaidoirie complète devant le Tribunal militaire à Neuchâtel le 16 août 1916''&lt;/ref&gt; the concept will also be developed by the [[French military]] with General [[Alexandre Percin]], then War Minister, dedicating a comprehensive study to the subject entitled ''Guerre à la Guerre''.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Percin, ''Guerre à la Guerre'' Paris: Montaigne 1927&lt;/ref&gt; The latter work, which especially explores the [[Military operation|operational]] and [[Military strategy|strategic]] dimension of the concept from the angle of [[military doctrine]] would become a seminal contribution to its academic establishment. At times defended by the [[Socialist International]] as in the 1923 discourse of labour unionist [[Edo Fimmen]] at the international congress for peace at the Hague&lt;ref&gt;Edo Fimmen, discours prononcé par Edo Fimmen au Congrès international pour la paix La Haye, du 10 au 15 décembre 1922''Guerre à la guerre: la tâche du prolétariat organisé dans le mouvement pour la paix mondiale''&lt;/ref&gt; the concept will remain politically neutral overall in the 20th century, being also claimed by the [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic movement]] with Gérard Marier and Jean Godin considering [[nuclear disarmament]] a central contribution to the war on war as a [[Christian]] mission&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Marier, Jean Godin, ''Guerre à la guerre: le catholique devant la folie nucléaire'' Paris 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary evolution==
[[File:Jean-Jacques Lebel (2008).png|thumb|right|200px|Jean-Jacques Lebel in 2008, in 1982 the poet took part in the collective work of UNESCO "''War on war; poets of the world at Unesco''" along with Allen Ginsberg.]]
[[File:Allen ginsberg 675.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Allen Ginsberg, 1979]]

===Unesco===
The [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] which constitution&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15244&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html constitution de l'UNESCO, signée le 16 novembre 1945, en vigueur le 4 novembre 1946]&lt;/ref&gt; declares "''That since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed''" describing a [[Memetics|memetical]] conception of war, brought together - in 1982 - thirteen poets for a collective work entitled "''War on war : The poet's cry''". &lt;ref&gt; Lebel, Jean Jacques; Adonis; Ai Qing; Breytenbach, Breyten; Cardenal, Ernesto; Cortez, Jayne; Faye, Jean Pierre; Ginsberg, Allen; Tan'si, Sony Labou; Mello, Thiago de; Pritam, Amrita; Shiraishi, Kazuko; Voznesenski, Andrei '' War on war; poets of the world at Unesco''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aberkane &amp; Goldstein and a peace [[positivism]]===
More recently the concept was discussed by scholars [[Joshua Goldstein]]&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Goldstein ''Winning the War on War: The Decline of Armed Conflict'' Worldwide Foreign Affairs, November/December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Idriss Aberkane]].&lt;ref&gt;Idriss Aberkane ''On the "war on war" in modern geopolitics'' e-international relations January 9th 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As Aberkane defines it "''it permits us to ask, before the war disease reaches its terminal phase, "has man domesticated war, or has war domesticated man?"''". Based on the paradigm of [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]] for the description of autonomy and the works of [[Idries Shah]] in [[group psychology]] Aberkane's discussion of the concept consists of considering armed conflicts [[Autopoiesis|autopoietic]] and therefore [[dissipative system]]s which are [[Parasitism|parasitic]] and comparable to [[Richard Dawkins]]' notion of [[selfish gene theory|selfish gene]] hence "''selfish wars''".&lt;ref&gt;Aberkane 2012, ibid&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptually Aberkane argues for a prescriptive use of peace and conflict studies, especially in a study on the defusing of the [[History of Xinjiang#Continued tensions|tensions in Xinjiang]]&lt;ref&gt;Aberkane, Idriss "''Yin or Yang: China and the Muslim World''" e-International Relations, 29 avril 2011, §4&lt;/ref&gt; by which he defends the logical soundness of the concept of a "war against war" in five points:
* (i) "''the qualitative complexity of the notion of [[National interest|interest]] (e.g. What you may think is not your interest may be in a broader perspective)''"
* (ii) "''the non-refuted possibility that external [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interests]] may be internalized within one single interest,''"
* (iii)"'' the fact that [[Hilbert's sixth problem]] has not been solved (ie physical reality is not axiomatized) which implies that''"
* (iv) "''while [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|limitation theorems]] can be demonstrated in [[first order logic]] (and [[game theory]]) there can be no limitation theorem predicating upon physical reality which comprises the notion of interest, thus in particular''"
* (v) "''the impossibility of the total interest of peace ie. the stable intersection of individual and collective peace in international relations cannot be demonstrated.''"
What Aberkane thus describes as "''erenologic positivism''" is transcribed in game theoretical vocabulary as that in international relations "''it is also not proven that a [[Pareto optimality|Pareto-optimal]] situation at the world level (or at a less formal level of describing diplomatic reality, a situation that may be reminiscent to the latter without its mathematical precision) could not be also overlapping with the [[Nash equilibrium]] of interacting individual interests.''"&lt;ref&gt;Aberkane, Ibid 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace–industrial complex===
{{Further information|Peace–industrial complex}}
At least two approaches to the '''war against war''' may be distinguished, the frontal opposition to war or [[Anti-war movement]] on the one side and the transcendent, post-war conception of [[William James]]' 'Moral Equivalent of war' positing, in the way of the [[UNESCO]], that the only way to end conflicts is to make Humanity busy with more fascinating endeavors than wars. In his Nobel acceptance speech [[Martin Luther King]] further underlined that idea which would become the basis of the transcendentist school (e.g. Aberkane):

{{cquote| We will not build a peaceful world by following a negative path. It is not enough to say "We must not wage war." It is necessary to love peace and sacrifice for it. We must concentrate not merely on the negative expulsion of war, but on the positive affirmation of peace. There is a fascinating little story that is preserved for us in Greek literature about [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] and the [[Siren (mythology)|Sirens]]. The Sirens had the ability to sing so sweetly that sailors could not resist steering toward their island. Many ships were lured upon the rocks, and men forgot home, duty, and honor as they flung themselves into the sea to be embraced by arms that drew them down to death. Ulysses, determined not to be lured by the Sirens, first decided to tie himself tightly to the mast of his boat, and his crew stuffed their ears with wax. But finally he and his crew learned a better way to save themselves: they took on board the beautiful singer [[Orpheus]] whose melodies were sweeter than the music of the Sirens. When Orpheus sang, who bothered to listen to the Sirens? &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1964/king-lecture.html Martin Luther King, Nobel Lecture, Dec. 11th 1964]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[File:Martin Luther King, Jr..jpg|thumb|right|200px| Official picture of Martin Luther King Jr. at the Nobel Foundation, 1964]]

Various scholars (Suter 1986, Aberkane 2012, Roberts 2009) and politicians (Seiberling 1972) have thus advocated that peace profiteering should simply be made palatably larger than any possible [[war profiteering]], thus transcending the war against war. However, the first generations of Peace-Industrial scholars have advocated frontal opposition to the [[military–industrial complex]] rather than its transcendent, voluntary metamorphosis into a globally benevolent yet very profitable peace-industrial complex.

[[File:John F. Seiberling 93rd Congress 1973.jpg|thumb|right|200px| US. Rep. John F. Seiberling circa the time of his 1972 address to the Congress calling for a Peace-industrial complex]]

In 1986 [[Keith Suter|Keith D. Suter]] defended his Ph.D dissertation on ''Creating the political will necessary for achieving multilateral disarmament : the need for a peace-industrial complex'',&lt;ref&gt;Suter, K. D.  Creating the political will necessary for achieving multilateral disarmament : the need for a peace-industrial complex, Ph.D Thesis, Deakin University, Victoria, 1986 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kwAcNQAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZNSIUYLxH8aM0AWzzIHICw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; which was further cited in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Summy, R. Salla, M.E 'Why the Cold War Ended: A Range of Interpretations' Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995 p.202&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a Peace-industrial complex had already been introduced as early as in 1969 in the U.S. Senate Committee on Government Operations.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Congress. Senate. Committee on Government Operations, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1969 p.147 [https://books.google.com/books?id=RJ83AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZNSIUYLxH8aM0AWzzIHICw&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The original quote affirmed direct opposition to the military-industrial complex and was therefore not transcendent in nature: "It is time for the United States to break the Huge military-industrial complex and begin in its stead a people and peace-industrial complex". It received further citation throughout the 1970s. The notion appeared in the [[United States Congress House Committee on Science and Astronautics]], Subcommittee on Science, Research, and Development in 1972 &lt;ref&gt;National science policy and priorities act of 1972: Hearings, Ninety-second Congress, second session U.S. Govt. Print. Off., 1972 p.153 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kXsqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zdeIUc3mB-210QWkg4CIBw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwADgK]&lt;/ref&gt;  in a congressional address by US [[John F. Seiberling|Rep. J. F. Seiberling]] (1972) &lt;ref&gt;Rep. J. F. Seiberling, "The case for economic conversion" Congressional record v.118, n°95, 13 June 1972, pp E6177-6179, cited in Science Policy Reviews, Volumes 4 à 5 Battelle Memorial Institute, 1972 p. 398 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ggQFAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zdeIUc3mB-210QWkg4CIBw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAjgK], see also Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the US Congress, Volume 118, Part 16 U.S. Government Printing Office, 1972 p.20738 [https://books.google.com/books?id=G20Udh7ynykC&amp;q=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zdeIUc3mB-210QWkg4CIBw&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBjgK]&lt;/ref&gt;

Suter further defended that "each country create a national Ministry for Peace",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i4pinternational.org/files/202/7.+national+ministries+for+peace.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; which was contemporary to the creation of the Ministry for Peace Australia (MFPA) initiative and the Global Alliance for Ministries &amp; Infrastructures for Peace (GAMIP). An Education for a Peace Industrial Complex conference (EPIC) is also mentioned in a 1984 issue of the Nuclear Times.&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Times, Volumes 3 to 4, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

If Kofi J. Roberts &lt;ref&gt;Roberts K. J. The Sargasso Bridge, iUniverse 2009 p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly called for the substitution of a military-industrial complex by a peace industrial complex which would enable the focusing on federal spendings on construction rather than destruction, Idriss J. Aberkane further defended the transcendent approach to the peace-industrial complex by calling it the "military-industrial complex 2.0" and thus neither the enemy nor the political complement to the military industrial complex but rather its natural, inevitable evolution on the account that investors (either institutional or private) will inevitably realize the larger profitability of construction over destruction. Aberkane also advocates the political viability of a peace-industrial complex by declaring that in the 21st century, what he calls "weapons of mass construction" will grant much larger political leverage, leadership and [[soft power]] than weapons of mass destruction.

{{cquote| every time a military technology makes it to civilian use it changes the world for good and what it brings you is love rather than hatred, for if you project destruction you're gonna be hated, if you project construction, you're gonna be loved. So what is power, truly, what is a [[superpower]]? Is it a nation that has [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]]? No it is not! Many nations have weapons of mass destruction they are not all superpowers (...) when you're looking at [[The Pentagon]] you're looking at a [[Military budget of the United States|budget]] of 740 billion US dollars, that's the budget of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] plus de [[Expenditures in the United States federal budget#Discretionary spending|discretionary budget]] that is allocated to Research and Development for defense. I'm not saying we should take it away from the Pentagon, I say we should move to the Pentagon 2.0. For so far, what has America gained in projecting every bits of these dollars? Every time America uses these dollars is it more loved? Is it more respected? Is it safer? Is it more trusted? Does it have more leadership? (...) America could project this money to gain love, respect, leadership and political power. This, is the military-industrial complex 2.0. [It] will be interested in weapons of mass construction rather than weapons of mass destruction because these weapons are the future in terms of power. For what was the power of the 20th century? In the 20th century power was [[Nuclear winter|the ability to go from a beautiful blue planet to a red one]]. If you could turn a blue planet into a red one you were powerful. We have the technology to do that, these (sic) are called weapons of mass construction. Do we have the technology to go the other way around? Can we [[Terraforming|turn a red planet - Mars in that case - into a beautiful green planet]]? We can't but when you're looking at a budget of seven hundred billions US dollars you can look into that. This is gonna be 21st century power, weapons of mass construction. Why? because if you project these weapons I guarantee you people are gonna love you }} &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLIzupsfiV8 Aberkane, Bring on the Peace-Industrial Complex, Wikistage Paris 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wellcome Research Laboratories''' was a site in [[Beckenham]], south-east London, that was a main research centre for pharmaceuticals. Until 1965, this laboratory site was situated in [[Kent]].

==History==
In 1894 [[Henry Wellcome]] set up a laboratory in central London to investigate a treatment for [[diphtheria]]. In 1898 it moved to Brockwell Hall in [[Herne Hill]] (now in [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]]). In 1919 Henry Wellcome bought a 105-acre site in Beckenham, Kent, which cost £32,000. The site had belonged to the Langley family since 1350. Langley Court had been built in 1886 by James Bucknall, who lived in the house with his family until 1914.

It was named the Wellcome Research Laboratories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f7DYvphaRhwC|title=New Scientist|first=Reed Business|last=Information|date=4 October 1984|publisher=Reed Business Information|accessdate=18 August 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1946 after the Wellcome Chemical Research Laboratories moved to the site. The [[Wellcome Trust]] had been set up in 1936, after the death in that year of Sir Henry Wellcome.

===Closure===
It closed in 1995 after Wellcome had been taken over by Glaxo in March 1995 to form Glaxo Wellcome. In December 2000, Glaxo Wellcome became [[GlaxoSmithKline]], when it merged with SmithKline Beecham.
