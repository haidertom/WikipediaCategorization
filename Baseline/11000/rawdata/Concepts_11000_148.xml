In [[software engineering]] and [[computer science]], '''abstraction''' is:

* the process of removing physical, spatial, or temporal details&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colburn|first=Timothy|last2=Shute|first2=Gary|date=2007-06-05|title=Abstraction in Computer Science|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11023-007-9061-7|journal=Minds and Machines|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=169–184|doi=10.1007/s11023-007-9061-7|issn=0924-6495}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]] in the study of objects or [[System|systems]] in order to more closely attend to other details of interest&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kramer|first=Jeff|date=2007-04-01|title=Is abstraction the key to computing?|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1232743.1232745|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=50|issue=4|pages=36–42|doi=10.1145/1232743.1232745|issn=0001-0782}}&lt;/ref&gt;; it is also very similar in nature to the process of [[generalization]];
* the [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]] [[concept]]-[[Object (philosophy)|objects]] which are created by keeping common features or attributes to various concrete objects or systems of study&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; — the result of the process of abstraction.

[[Abstraction|Abstraction, in general]], is a fundamental concept to computer science and [[software development]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ben-Ari|first=Mordechai|date=1998-03-01|title=Constructivism in computer science education|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=274790.274308|journal=ACM SIGCSE Bulletin|volume=30|issue=1|pages=257, 257–261|doi=10.1145/274790.274308|issn=0097-8418}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The process of abstraction can also be referred to as '''modeling''' and is closely related to the concepts of ''[[theory]]'' and ''[[design]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Comer|first=D. E.|last2=Gries|first2=David|last3=Mulder|first3=Michael C.|last4=Tucker|first4=Allen|last5=Turner|first5=A.

[[Conceptual model|Models]] can also be considered types of abstractions per their generalization of aspects of [[reality]].

Abstraction in computer science is also closely related to [[Abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction in mathematics]] due to their common focus on building abstractions as objects&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, but is also related to other notions of abstraction used in other fields [[Abstraction (art)|such as art]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Abstractions may also refer to vehicles, features, or rules of [[Computation|computational systems]] or [[Programming language|programming languages]] that carry or utilize features of or abstraction itself, such as:

==Rationale==
Computing mostly operates independently of the concrete world. The hardware implements a [[model of computation]] that is interchangeable with others.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} The software is structured in [[software architecture|architecture]]s to enable humans to create the enormous systems by concentrating on a few issues at a time. These architectures are made of specific choices of abstractions. [[Greenspun's Tenth Rule]] is an [[aphorism]] on how such an architecture is both inevitable and complex.

A central form of abstraction in computing is language abstraction: new artificial languages are developed to express specific aspects of a system. ''[[Modeling languages]]'' help in planning. ''[[Computer language]]s'' can be processed with a computer. An example of this abstraction process is the generational development of [[programming language]]s from the [[First-generation programming language|machine language]] to the [[Second-generation programming language|assembly language]] and the [[Third-generation programming language|high-level language]]. Each stage can be used as a stepping stone for the next stage. The language abstraction continues for example in [[scripting language]]s and [[domain-specific programming language]]s.

Within a programming language, some features let the programmer create new abstractions. These include [[subroutine]]s, [[module (programming)|modules]], [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]], and [[software component]]s. Some other abstractions such as [[software design pattern]]s and [[software architecture#Architecture examples|architectural styles]] remain invisible to a [[translator (computing)|translator]] and operate only in the design of a system.

Some abstractions try to limit the range of concepts a programmer needs to be aware of, by completely hiding the abstractions that they in turn are built on. The software engineer and writer [[Joel Spolsky]] has criticised these efforts by claiming that all abstractions are ''[[leaky abstraction|leaky]]'' — that they can never completely hide the details below;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html|title=The Law of Leaky Abstractions|last1=Spolsky|first=Joel}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this does not negate the usefulness of abstraction.

Some abstractions are designed to inter-operate with other abstractions - for example, a programming language may contain a [[foreign function interface]] for making calls to the lower-level language.

In simple terms, abstraction is removing irrelevant data so a program is easier to understand.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Language features==

===Programming languages===
{{Main|Programming language}}

Different programming languages provide different types of abstraction, depending on the intended applications for the language. For example:

* In [[object-oriented programming language]]s such as [[C++]], [[Object Pascal]], or [[Java (programming language)|Java]], the concept of '''abstraction''' has itself become a declarative statement – using the [[keyword (computer programming)|keyword]]s ''&lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt;'' (in [[C++]]) or ''&lt;code&gt;abstract&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;ref name="Oracle Java abstract"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html|title=Abstract Methods and Classes|website=The Java™ Tutorials|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''&lt;code&gt;interface&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;ref name="Oracle Java interface"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/interfaceAsType.html|title=Using an Interface as a Type|website=The Java™ Tutorials|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]). After such a declaration, it is the responsibility of the programmer to implement a [[Class (computer science)|class]] to instantiate the [[Object (computer science)|object]] of the declaration.
* [[Functional programming language]]s commonly exhibit abstractions related to functions, such as [[lambda abstraction]]s (making a term into a function of some variable) and [[higher-order function]]s (parameters are functions). &lt;!-- This has to be merged in the following sections. --&gt;
* Modern members of the Lisp programming language family such as [[Clojure]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] and [[Common Lisp]] support [[Macro (computer science)#Syntactic macros|macro systems]] to allow syntactic abstraction. Other programming languages such as [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] also have macros, or very similar [[metaprogramming]] features (for example, [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] has [[Template Haskell]], and [[OCaml]] has [[MetaOCaml]]). These can allow a programmer to eliminate [[boilerplate code]], abstract away tedious function call sequences, implement new [[Control flow|control flow structures]], and implement [[Domain-specific language|Domain Specific Languages (DSLs)]], which allow domain-specific concepts to be expressed in concise and elegant ways. All of these, when used correctly, improve both the programmer's efficiency and the clarity of the code by making the intended purpose more explicit. A consequence of syntactic abstraction is also that any Lisp dialect and in fact almost any programming language can, in principle, be implemented in any modern Lisp with significantly reduced (but still non-trivial in some cases) effort when compared to "more traditional" programming languages such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[Java (programming language)|Java]].

===Specification methods===
{{Main|Formal specification}}

Analysts have developed various methods to formally specify software systems.  Some known methods include:

* Abstract-model based method (VDM, Z);
* Algebraic techniques (Larch, CLEAR, OBJ, ACT ONE, CASL);
* Process-based techniques (LOTOS, SDL, Estelle);
* Trace-based techniques (SPECIAL, TAM);
* Knowledge-based techniques (Refine, Gist).

===Specification languages===
{{Main|Specification language}}

Specification languages generally rely on abstractions of one kind or another, since specifications are typically defined earlier in a project, (and at a more abstract level) than an eventual implementation. The [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] specification language, for example, allows the definition of ''abstract'' classes, which in a waterfall project, remain abstract during the architecture and specification phase of the project.

==Control abstraction==
{{Main|Control flow}}

Programming languages offer control abstraction as one of the main purposes of their use. Computer machines understand operations at the very low level such as moving some bits from one location of the memory to another location and producing the sum of two sequences of bits. Programming languages allow this to be done in the higher level. For example, consider this statement written in a [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]-like fashion:

:&lt;code&gt;a := (1 + 2) * 5&lt;/code&gt;

To a human, this seems a fairly simple and obvious calculation (''"one plus two is three, times five is fifteen"''). However, the low-level steps necessary to carry out this evaluation, and return the value "15", and then assign that value to the variable "a", are actually quite subtle and complex. The values need to be converted to binary representation (often a much more complicated task than one would think) and the calculations decomposed (by the compiler or interpreter) into assembly instructions (again, which are much less intuitive to the programmer: operations such as shifting a binary register left, or adding the binary complement of the contents of one register to another, are simply not how humans think about the abstract arithmetical operations of addition or multiplication). Finally, assigning the resulting value of "15" to the variable labeled "a", so that "a" can be used later, involves additional 'behind-the-scenes' steps of looking up a variable's label and the resultant location in physical or virtual memory, storing the binary representation of "15" to that memory location, etc.

Without control abstraction, a programmer would need to specify ''all'' the register/binary-level steps each time they simply wanted to add or multiply a couple of numbers and assign the result to a variable. Such duplication of effort has two serious negative consequences:

# it forces the programmer to constantly repeat fairly common tasks every time a similar operation is needed
# it forces the programmer to program for the particular hardware and instruction set

===Structured programming===
{{Main|Structured programming}}

Structured programming involves the splitting of complex program tasks into smaller pieces with clear flow-control and interfaces between components, with reduction of the complexity potential for side-effects.

In a simple program, this may aim to ensure that loops have single or obvious exit points and (where possible) to have single exit points from functions and procedures.

In a larger system, it may involve breaking down complex tasks into many different modules. Consider a system which handles payroll on ships and at shore offices:

* The uppermost level may feature a menu of typical end-user operations.
* Within that could be standalone executables or libraries for tasks such as signing on and off employees or printing checks.
* Within each of those standalone components there could be many different source files, each containing the program code to handle a part of the problem, with only selected interfaces available to other parts of the program. A sign on program could have source files for each data entry screen and the database interface (which may itself be a standalone third party library or a statically linked set of library routines).
*Either the database or the payroll application also has to initiate the process of exchanging data with between ship and shore, and that data transfer task will often contain many other components.

These layers produce the effect of isolating the implementation details of one component and its assorted internal methods from the others. Object-oriented programming embraces and extends this concept.

==Data abstraction==
{{Main|Abstract data type}}

Data abstraction enforces a clear separation between the ''abstract'' properties of a [[data type]] and the ''concrete'' details of its implementation. The abstract properties are those that are visible to client code that makes use of the data type—the ''interface'' to the data type—while the concrete implementation is kept entirely private, and indeed can change, for example to incorporate efficiency improvements over time. The idea is that such changes are not supposed to have any impact on client code, since they involve no difference in the abstract behaviour.

For example, one could define an [[abstract data type]] called ''lookup table'' which uniquely associates ''keys'' with ''values'', and in which values may be retrieved by specifying their corresponding keys. Such a lookup table may be implemented in various ways: as a [[hash table]], a [[binary search tree]], or even a simple linear [[List (computing)|list]] of (key:value) pairs. As far as client code is concerned, the abstract properties of the type are the same in each case.

Of course, this all relies on getting the details of the interface right in the first place, since any changes there can have major impacts on client code. As one way to look at this: the interface forms a ''contract'' on agreed behaviour between the data type and client code; anything not spelled out in the contract is subject to change without notice.

==Abstraction in object oriented programming==
{{Main|Object (computer science)}}

In [[object-oriented programming]] theory, '''abstraction''' involves the facility to define objects that represent abstract "actors" that can perform work, report on and change their state, and "communicate" with other objects in the system. The term [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|encapsulation]] refers to the hiding of [[state (computer science)|state]] details, but extending the concept of ''data type'' from earlier programming languages to associate ''behavior'' most strongly with the data, and standardizing the way that different data types interact, is the beginning of '''abstraction'''.  When abstraction proceeds into the operations defined, enabling objects of different types to be substituted, it is called [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]. When it proceeds in the opposite direction, inside the types or classes, structuring them to simplify a complex set of relationships, it is called [[Delegation (object-oriented programming)|delegation]] or [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]].

Various object-oriented programming languages offer similar facilities for abstraction, all to support a general strategy of [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] in object-oriented programming, which includes the substitution of one [[type in object-oriented programming|type]] for another in the same or similar role. Although not as generally supported, a [[configuration in object-oriented programming|configuration]] or image or package may predetermine a great many of these [[name binding|bindings]] at [[compile-time]], [[link-time]], or [[loadtime]]. This would leave only a minimum of such bindings to change at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]].

[[Common Lisp Object System]] or [[Self (programming language)|Self]], for example, feature less of a class-instance distinction and more use of delegation for [[polymorphism in object-oriented programming|polymorphism]]. Individual objects and functions are abstracted more flexibly to better fit with a shared functional heritage from [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]].

C++ exemplifies another extreme: it relies heavily on [[generic programming|templates]] and [[method overloading|overloading]] and other static bindings at compile-time, which in turn has certain flexibility problems.

Although these examples offer alternate strategies for achieving the same abstraction, they do not fundamentally alter the need to support abstract nouns in code - all programming relies on an ability to abstract verbs as functions, nouns as data structures, and either as processes.

Consider for example a sample [[Java (programming language)|Java]] fragment to represent some common farm "animals" to a level of abstraction suitable to model simple aspects of their hunger and feeding. It defines an &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; class to represent both the state of the animal and its functions:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
public class Animal extends LivingThing
{
     private Location loc;
     private double energyReserves;

     public boolean isHungry() {
         return energyReserves &lt; 2.5;
     }
     public void eat(Food food) {
         // Consume food
         energyReserves += food.getCalories();
     }
     public void moveTo(Location location) {
         // Move to new location
         this.loc = location;
     }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
With the above definition, one could create objects of type &lt;tt&gt;Animal&lt;/tt&gt; and call their methods like this:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
thePig = new Animal();
theCow = new Animal();
if (thePig.isHungry()) {
    thePig.eat(tableScraps);
}
if (theCow.isHungry()) {
    theCow.eat(grass);
}
theCow.moveTo(theBarn);
&lt;/source&gt;
In the above example, the class ''&lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt;'' is an abstraction used in place of an actual animal, ''&lt;code&gt;LivingThing&lt;/code&gt;'' is a further abstraction (in this case a generalisation) of ''&lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt;''.

If one requires a more differentiated hierarchy of animals — to differentiate, say, those who provide milk from those who provide nothing except meat at the end of their lives — that is an intermediary level of abstraction, probably DairyAnimal (cows, goats) who would eat foods suitable to giving good milk, and MeatAnimal (pigs, steers) who would eat foods to give the best meat-quality.

Such an abstraction could remove the need for the application coder to specify the type of food, so s/he could concentrate instead on the feeding schedule. The two classes could be related using [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]] or stand alone, and the programmer could define varying degrees of [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] between the two types. These facilities tend to vary drastically between languages, but in general each can achieve anything that is possible with any of the others. A great many operation overloads, data type by data type, can have the same effect at compile-time as any degree of inheritance or other means to achieve polymorphism. The class notation is simply a coder's convenience.

===Object-oriented design===
{{Main|Object-oriented design}}

Decisions regarding what to abstract and what to keep under the control of the coder become the major concern of object-oriented design and [[domain analysis]]&amp;mdash;actually determining the relevant relationships in the real world is the concern of [[object-oriented analysis and design|object-oriented analysis]] or [[legacy analysis]].

In general, to determine appropriate abstraction, one must make many small decisions about scope (domain analysis), determine what other systems one must cooperate with (legacy analysis), then perform a detailed object-oriented analysis which is expressed within project time and budget constraints as an object-oriented design. In our simple example, the domain is the barnyard, the live pigs and cows and their eating habits are the legacy constraints, the detailed analysis is that coders must have the flexibility to feed the animals what is available and thus there is no reason to code the type of food into the class itself, and the design is a single simple Animal class of which pigs and cows are instances with the same functions. A decision to differentiate DairyAnimal would change the detailed analysis but the domain and legacy analysis would be unchanged&amp;mdash;thus it is entirely under the control of the programmer, and we refer to abstraction in object-oriented programming as distinct from abstraction in domain or legacy analysis.

==Considerations==
When discussing [[formal semantics of programming languages]], [[formal methods]] or [[abstract interpretation]], '''abstraction''' refers to the act of considering a less detailed, but safe, definition of the observed program behaviors. For instance, one may observe only the final result of program executions instead of considering all the intermediate steps of executions. Abstraction is defined to a '''concrete''' (more precise) model of execution.

Abstraction may be '''exact''' or '''faithful''' with respect to a property if one can answer a question about the property equally well on the concrete or abstract model. For instance, if we wish to know what the result of the evaluation of a mathematical expression involving only integers +, -, ×, is worth [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''n'', we need only perform all operations modulo ''n'' (a familiar form of this abstraction is [[casting out nines]]).

Abstractions, however, though not necessarily '''exact''', should be '''sound'''. That is, it should be possible to get sound answers from them&amp;mdash;even though the abstraction may simply yield a result of [[undecidable problem|undecidability]]. For instance, we may abstract the students in a class by their minimal and maximal ages; if one asks whether a certain person belongs to that class, one may simply compare that person's age with the minimal and maximal ages; if his age lies outside the range, one may safely answer that the person does not belong to the class; if it does not, one may only answer "I don't know".

The level of abstraction included in a programming language can influence its overall [[usability]]. The [[Cognitive dimensions]] framework includes the concept of ''abstraction gradient'' in a formalism. This framework allows the designer of a programming language to study the trade-offs between abstraction and other characteristics of the design, and how changes in abstraction influence the language usability.

Abstractions can prove useful when dealing with computer programs, because non-trivial properties of computer programs are essentially [[undecidable problem|undecidable]] (see [[Rice's theorem]]). As a consequence, automatic methods for deriving information on the behavior of computer programs either have to drop termination (on some occasions, they may fail, crash or never yield out a result), soundness (they may provide false information), or precision (they may answer "I don't know" to some questions).

Abstraction is the core concept of [[abstract interpretation]]. [[Model checking]] generally takes place on abstract versions of the studied systems.

==Levels of abstraction==
{{Main|Abstraction layer}}

Computer science commonly presents ''levels'' (or, less commonly, ''layers'') of abstraction, wherein each level represents a different model of the same information and processes, but with varying amounts of detail. Each level uses a system of expression involving a unique set of objects and compositions that apply only to a particular domain.
&lt;ref&gt;[[Luciano Floridi]], [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/ieg/research_reports/ieg_rr221104.pdf ''Levellism and the Method of Abstraction'']
IEG – Research Report 22.11.04&lt;/ref&gt;
Each relatively abstract, "higher" level builds on a relatively concrete, "lower" level, which tends to provide an increasingly "granular" representation. For example, gates build on electronic circuits, binary on gates, machine language on binary, programming language on machine language, applications and operating systems on programming languages. Each level is embodied, but not determined, by the level beneath it, making it a language of description that is somewhat self-contained.

===Database systems===
{{Main|Database management system}}

Since many users of database systems lack in-depth familiarity with computer data-structures, database developers often hide complexity through the following levels:

[[Image:Data abstraction levels.png|thumb|Data abstraction levels of a database system]]

'''Physical level:''' The lowest level of abstraction describes ''how'' a system actually stores data. The physical level describes complex low-level data structures in detail.

'''Logical level:''' The next higher level of abstraction describes ''what'' data the database stores, and what relationships exist among those data. The logical level thus describes an entire database in terms of a small number of relatively simple structures. Although implementation of the simple structures at the logical level may involve complex physical level structures, the user of the logical level does not need to be aware of this complexity. This is referred to as [[physical data independence]]. [[Database administrator]]s, who must decide what information to keep in a database, use the logical level of abstraction.

'''View level:''' The highest level of abstraction describes only part of the entire database. Even though the logical level uses simpler structures, complexity remains because of the variety of information stored in a large database. Many users of a database system do not need all this information; instead, they need to access only a part of the database. The view level of abstraction exists to simplify their interaction with the system. The system may provide many [[view (database)|view]]s for the same database.

===Layered architecture===
{{Main|Abstraction layer}}
The ability to provide a [[design]] of different levels of abstraction can

* simplify the design considerably
* enable different role players to effectively work at various levels of abstraction
* support the portability of [[software artifact]]s (model-based ideally)

[[Systems design]] and [[Business process modeling|business process design]] can both use this. Some [[Software modeling|design processes]] specifically generate designs that contain various levels of abstraction.

Layered architecture partitions the concerns of the application into stacked groups (layers).
It is a technique used in designing computer software, hardware, and communications in which system or network components are isolated in layers so that changes can be made in one layer without affecting the others.

The '''axiom of reducibility''' was introduced by [[Bertrand Russell]] in the early 20th century as part of his [[Type theory|ramified theory of types]]. Russell devised and introduced the axiom in an attempt to manage the contradictions he had discovered in his analysis of [[set theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Type Theory|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, Stanford University|accessdate=29 March 2012|author=Thierry Coquand|date=20 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
With Russell's discovery (1901, 1902)&lt;ref&gt;According to van Heijenoort 1967:124, Russell discovered the paradox in June 1901. van Heijenoort in turn references Bertrand Russell (1944) "My mental development" in ''The philosophy of Bertrand Russell'', edited by Paul Arthur Schilpp (Tudor, New York), page 13. But Russell did not report it to Frege until his letter to Frege dated 16 June 1902. Livio 2009:186 reports the same date. Livio 2009:191 writes that Zermelo discovered the paradox as early as 1900, but does not give his source for this (Ewald 1996?). Indeed, Zermelo makes this claim in a footnote 9 to his 1908 ''A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering'' in van Heijenoort 1967:191.&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[paradox]] in [[Gottlob Frege]]'s 1879 ''Begriffsschrift'' and Frege's acknowledgment of the same (1902), Russell tentatively introduced his solution as "Appendix B: Doctrine of Types" in his 1903 ''The Principles of Mathematics''.&lt;ref&gt;cf Introductory remarks by W. V. Quine preceding Bertrand Russell (1908a) reprinted in van Heijenoort 1967:150.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Russell's paradox|contradiction]] can be stated as "the class of all classes that do not contain themselves as elements".&lt;ref&gt;cf Introductory remarks by W. V. Quine preceding Bertrand Russell (1908a) reprinted in van Heijenoort 1967:150.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of this appendix Russell asserts that his "doctrine" would solve the immediate problem posed by Frege, but "there is at least one closely analogous contradiction which is probably not soluble by this doctrine. The totality of all logical objects, or of all propositions, involves, it would seem a fundamental logical difficulty. What the complete solution of the difficulty may be, I have not succeeded in discovering; but as it affects the very foundations of reasoning..."&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1903:528&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of his 1908 ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types''&lt;ref&gt;reprinted in van Heijenoort 150–182&lt;/ref&gt; Russell had studied "the contradictions" (among them the [[Epimenides paradox]], the [[Burali-Forti paradox]], and [[Richard's paradox]]) and concluded that "In all the contradictions there is a common characteristic, which we may describe as self-reference or reflexiveness".&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1908:154. The exact wording appears in Whitehead and Russell 1913 reprinted to *53 1962:60&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1903, Russell defined ''predicative'' functions as those whose order is one more than the highest-order function occurring in the expression of the function. While these were fine for the situation, ''impredicative'' functions had to be disallowed:

{{quote|A function whose argument is an individual and whose value is always a first-order proposition will be called a first-order function. A function involving a first-order function or proposition as apparent variable will be called a second-order function, and so on. A function of one variable which is of the order next above that of its argument will be called a ''predicative'' function; the same name will be given to a function of several variables [etc].&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1908a in van Heijenoort 1967:165.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He repeats this definition in a slightly different way later in the paper (together with a subtle prohibition that they would express more clearly in 1913):

{{quote|A predicative function of ''x'' is one whose values are propositions of the type next above that of ''x'', if ''x'' is an individual or a proposition, or that of values of ''x'' if ''x'' is a function. It may be described as one in which the apparent variables, if any, are all of the same type as ''x'' or of lower type; and a variable is of lower type than ''x'' '''if it can significantly occur as argument to ''x'', or as argument to an argument to ''x'', and so forth.''' [emphasis added]&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1908a in van Heijenoort 1967:169.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This usage carries over to [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and Russell's 1913 ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' wherein the authors devote an entire subsection of their Chapter II: "The Theory of Logical Types" to subchapter I. ''The Vicious-Circle Principle'': "We will define a function of one variable as ''predicative'' when it is of the next order above that of its argument, i.e. of the lowest order compatible with its having that argument. . . A function of several arguments is predicative if there is one of its arguments such that, when the other arguments have values assigned to them, we obtain a predicative function of the one undetermined argument."&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead and Russell 1913 reprinted to *53 1962:53&lt;/ref&gt;

They again propose the definition of a ''predicative function'' as one that does not violate The Theory of Logical Types. Indeed the authors assert such violations are "incapable [to achieve]" and "impossible":

{{quote|We are thus led to the conclusion, both from the vicious-circle principle and from direct inspection, that the functions to which a given object ''a'' can be an argument are incapable of being arguments to each other, and that they have no term in common with the functions to which they can be arguments. We are thus led to construct a hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead and Russell 1913 reprinted to *53 1962:48&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The authors stress the word ''impossible'':

{{quote|if we are not mistaken, that not only is it impossible for a function φz&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt; to have itself or anything derived from it as argument, but that, if ψz&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt; is another function such there are arguments ''a'' with which both "φa" and "ψa" are significant, then ψz&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt; and anything derived from it cannot significantly be argument to φz&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;In the original z&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt; is z with a circumflex (hat) over it, etc. Whitehead and Russell 1913 reprinted to *53 1962:47&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Russell's axiom of reducibility==
The axiom of reducibility states that any truth function (i.e. [[propositional function]]) can be expressed by a formally equivalent ''predicative'' truth function. It made its first appearance in [[Bertrand Russell]]'s (1908) ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types'', but only after some five years of trial and error.&lt;ref&gt;cf commentary by [[W. V. Quine]] in van Heijenoort 1967:150–152&lt;/ref&gt; In his words: 
{{quote|Thus a predicative function of an individual is a first-order function; and for higher types of arguments, predicative functions take the place that first-order functions take in respect of individuals. We assume then, that every function is equivalent, for all its values, to some predicative function of the same argument. This assumption seems to be the essence of the usual assumption of classes [modern sets] . . . we will call this assumption the ''axiom of classes'', or the '''''axiom of reducibility'''''.&lt;ref&gt;boldface added, cf Russell 1908 reprinted in van Heijenoort 1967:167&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For relations (functions of two variables such as "For all x and for all y, those values for which f(x,y) is true" i.e. ∀x∀y: f(x,y)), Russell assumed an ''axiom of relations'', or [the same] '''''axiom of reducibility'''''.

In 1903, he proposed a possible process of evaluating such a 2-place function by comparing the process to double integration: One after another, plug into ''x'' definite values ''a&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' (i.e. the particular ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is "a constant" or a parameter held constant), then evaluate f(''a&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'',''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') across all the ''n'' instances of possible ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. For all ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' evaluate f(a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''), then for all ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' evaluate f(''a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''), etc until all the ''x'' = ''a&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' are exhausted). This would create an ''m'' by ''n'' matrix of values: TRUE or UNKNOWN. (In this exposition, the use of indices is a modern convenience.) 

In 1908, Russell made no mention of this [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of ''x'', ''y'' values that render a two-place function (e.g. relation) TRUE, but by 1913 he has introduced a matrix-like concept into "function". In *12 of [[Principia Mathematica]] (1913) he defines "a matrix" as "any function, of however many variables, which does not involve any apparent variables. Then any possible function other than a matrix is derived from a matrix by means of generalisation, i.e. by considering the proposition which asserts that the function in question is true with all possible values or with some values of one of the arguments, the other argument or arguments remaining undetermined".&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead and Russell 1913:162&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if one asserts that "∀y: f(x, y) is true", then ''x'' is the apparent variable because it is unspecified. 

Russell now defines a matrix of "individuals" as a ''first-order'' matrix, and he follows a similar process to define a ''second-order matrix'', etc. Finally, he introduces the definition of a ''predicative function'':

{{quote|A function is said to be ''predicative'' when it is a matrix. It will be observed that, in a hierarchy in which all the variables are individuals or matrices, a matrix is the same thing as an elementary function [cf 1913:127, meaning: the function contains ''no'' apparent variables]. ¶ "Matrix" or "predicative function" is a primitive idea.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead and Russell 1913:164&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From this reasoning, he then uses the same wording to propose the same ''axioms of reducibility'' as he did in his 1908.

As an aside, Russell in his 1903 considered, and then rejected, "a temptation to regard a relation as definable in extension as a class of couples",&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1903:99&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the modern set-theoretic notion of [[ordered pair]]. An intuitive version of this notion appeared in Frege's (1879) ''Begriffsschrift'' (translated in van Heijenoort 1967:23); Russell's 1903 followed closely the work of Frege (cf Russell 1903:505ff). Russell worried that "it is necessary to give sense to the couple, to distinguish the referent from the relatum: thus a couple becomes essentially distinct from a class of two terms, and must itself be introduced as a primitive idea. It would seem, viewing the idea philosophically, that sense can only be derived from some relational proposition . . . it seems therefore more correct to take an [[intension]]al view of relations, and to identify them rather with class-concepts than with classes".&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1903:99&lt;/ref&gt; As shown below, [[Norbert Wiener]] (1914) reduced the notion of relation to class by his definition of an ordered pair.

==Criticism==

===Zermelo 1908===
The outright prohibition implied by Russell's ''axiom of reducibility'' was roundly criticised by [[Ernst Zermelo]] in his 1908 ''Investigations in the foundations of set theory I'', stung as he was by a demand similar to that of Russell that came from [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]]:

{{quote|According to Poincaré (1906, p. 307) a definition is "predicative" and logically admissible only if it ''excludes'' all objects that are "dependent" upon the notion defined, that is, that can in any way be determined by it.&lt;ref&gt;Zermelo (1908) ''The possibility of a well-ordering'' reprinted in van Heijenoort 1967:190&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Zermelo countered:

{{quote|A definition may very well rely upon notions that are equivalent to the one being defined; indeed in every definition ''definiens'' and ''definiendum'' are equivalent notions, and the strict observance of Poincaré's demand would make every definition, hence all of science, impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Zermelo (1908) ''The possibility of a well-ordering'' reprinted in van Heijenoort 1967:190&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Wiener 1914===
In his 1914 ''A simplification of the logic of relations'', [[Norbert Wiener]] removed the need for the axiom of reducibility as applied to relations between two variables ''x'', and ''y'' e.g. φ(''x'',''y''). He did this by introducing a way to express a relation as a set of ordered pairs: "It will be seen that what we have done is practically to revert to Schröder's treatment of a relation as a class [set] of ordered couples".&lt;ref&gt;Wiener 1914 in van Heijenoort 1967:226&lt;/ref&gt; Van Heijenoort observes that "[b]y giving a definition of the ordered pair of two-elements in terms of class operations, the note reduced the theory of relations to that of classes."&lt;ref&gt;Wiener in van Heijenoort 1967:224&lt;/ref&gt; But Wiener opined that while he had dispatched Russell and Whitehead's two-variable version of the axiom *12.11, the single-variable version of the axiom of reducibility for (axiom *12.1 in ''Principia Mathematica'') was still necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Wiener 1914 in van Heijenoort 1967:224&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wittgenstein 1918===
[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], while imprisoned in a prison camp, finished his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''. His introduction credits "the great works of Frege and the writings of my friend Bertrand Russell". Not a self-effacing intellectual, he pronounced that "the ''truth'' of the thoughts communicated here seems to me unassailable and definitive. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the problems have in essentials been finally solved."&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein 1922 in HarperCollins 2009:4&lt;/ref&gt; So given such an attitude, it is no surprise that Russell's theory of types comes under criticism:
{{quote|3.33
:In logical syntax the meaning of a sign ought never to play a role; it must admit of being established without mention being thereby made of the ''meaning'' of a sign; it ought to presuppose ''only'' the description of the expressions.
3.331
:From this observation we get a further view – into Russell's ''Theory of Types''. Russell's error is shown by the fact that in drawing up his symbolic rules he has to speak of the meaning of the signs.
3.332
:No proposition can say anything about itself, because the proposition sign cannot be contained in itself (that is the "whole theory of types").
3.333
:A function cannot be its own argument, because the functional sign already contains the prototype of its own argument and it cannot contain itself. ... Herewith Russell's paradox vanishes.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein 1922 in HarperCollins 2009:18&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This appears to support the same argument Russell uses to erase his "paradox". This "using the signs" to "speak of the signs" Russell criticises in his introduction that preceded the original English translation:

{{quote|What causes hesitation is the fact that, after all, Mr Wittgenstein manages to say a good deal about what cannot be said, thus suggesting to the sceptical reader that possibly there may be some loophole through a hierarchy of languages, or by some other exit.}}

This problem appears later when Wittgenstein arrives at this gentle disavowal of the axiom of reducibility—one interpretation of the following is that Wittgenstein is saying that Russell has made (what is known today as) a [[category error]]; Russell has asserted (inserted into the theory) a "further law of logic" when ''all'' the laws (e.g. the unbounded [[Sheffer stroke]] adopted by Wittgenstein) have ''already'' been asserted:

{{quote|6.123
:It is clear that the laws of logic cannot themselves obey further logical laws. (There is not, as Russell supposed, for every "type" a special law of contradiction; but one is sufficient, since it is not applied to itself.)
6.1231
:The mark of logical propositions is not their general validity. To be general is only to be accidentally valid for all things. An ungeneralised proposition can be tautologous just as well as a generalised one.
6.1232
:Logical general validity, we could call essential as opposed to accidental general validity, e.g., of the proposition "all men are mortal". Propositions like Russell's "axiom of reducibility" are not logical propositions, and this explains our feeling that, if true, they can only be true by a happy chance.
6.1233
:We can imagine a world in which the axiom of reducibility is not valid. But it is clear that logic has nothing to do with the question of whether our world is really of this kind or not.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein 1922 in HarperCollins 2009:70&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Russell 1919===
Russell in his 1919 ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'', a non-mathematical companion to his first edition of ''PM'', discusses his Axiom of Reducibility in Chapter 17 ''Classes'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;146ff).  He concludes that "we cannot accept "class" as a primitive idea; the symbols for classes are "mere conveniences" and classes are "logical fictions, or (as we say) 'incomplete symbols' ... classes cannot be regarded as part of the ultimate furniture of the world" (p.&amp;nbsp;146). The reason for this is because of the problem of impredicativity: "classes cannot be regarded as a species of individuals, on account of the contradiction about classes which are not members of themselves ... and because we can prove that the number of classes is greater than the number of individuals, [etc]". What he then does is propose 5 obligations that must be satisfied with respect to a theory of classes, and the result is his axiom of reducibility. He states that this axiom is "a generalised form of Leibniz's identity of indiscernibles" (p.&amp;nbsp;155). But he concludes Leibniz's assumption is not necessarily true for all possible predicates in all possible worlds, so he concludes that:

{{quote|I do not see any reason to believe that the axiom of reducibility is logically necessary, which is what would be meant by saying that it is true in all possible worlds. The admission of this axiom into a system of logic is therefore a defect ... a dubious assumption. (p. 155)}}

The goal that he sets for himself then is "adjustments to his theory" of avoiding classes:
{{quote|in its reduction of propositions nominally about classes to propositions about their defining functions. The avoidance of classes as entities by this method must, it would be seem, be sound in principle, however the detail may still require adjustment. (p. 155)}}

===Skolem 1922===
[[Thoralf Skolem]] in his 1922 ''Some remarks on axiomatised set theory'' took a less than positive attitude toward "Russell and Whitehead" (i.e. their work ''Principia Mathematica''):

{{quote|Until now, so far as I know, only ''one'' such system of axioms has found rather general acceptance, namely that constructed by Zermelo (1908). Russell and Whitehead, too, constructed a system of logic that provides a foundation for set theory; if I am not mistaken, however, mathematicians have taken but little interest in it.&lt;ref&gt;Skolem 1922 in van Heijenoort 1967:291&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Skolem then observes the problems of what he called "nonpredicative definition" in the set theory of Zermelo:&lt;ref&gt;Zermelo stipulates that there exist "a domain ''B'' of objects, among which are the sets." But by a theorem Zermelo proves that this domain ''B'' cannot be a set itself "and this disposes of the Russell antinomy so far as we are concerned."(cf Zermelo 1908 in van Heijenoort:203) The ultimate problem (to be answered by Skolem [1922] and Fraenkel [1922]) is a precise definition of Zermelo's notion of ''definite property'' which, via Zermelo's Axiom of separation (Axiom der Aussonderung), when applied via a propositional function to a set ''M'', separates from ''M'' a subset e.g. ''M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (Skolem 1922 in van Heijenoort 1967:292).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|the difficulty is that we have to form some sets whose existence depends upon ''all'' sets ... Poincaré called this kind of definition and regarded it as the real logical weakness of set theory.&lt;ref&gt;Skolem 1922 in van Heijenoort 1967:297. In a footnote 7 to the quotation above, he backs this up with a demonstration derived from the axioms of Zermelo: "A typical nonpredicative stipulation, is for example that the intersection of all sets that have an arbitrary definite property ''E'' again be a set. This in fact follows from the axioms [etc]."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While Skolem is mainly addressing a problem with Zermelo's set theory, he does make this observation about the ''axiom of reducibility'':

{{quote|they [Russell and Whitehead], too, simply content themselves with circumventing the difficulty by introducing a stipulation, the ''axiom of reducibility''. Actually, this axiom decrees that the nonpredicative stipulations will be satisfied. There is no proof of that; besides, so far as I can see, such a proof must be impossible from Russell and Whitehead's point of view as well as from Zermelo's. [emphasis added]&lt;ref&gt;Skolem 1922 in van Heijenoort 1967:297&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Russell 1927===
In his 1927 ''Introduction'' to the second edition of ''Principia Mathematica'' Russell criticises his own axiom:

{{quote|One point in regard to which improvement is obviously desirable is the axiom of reducibility (*12.1.11). This axiom has a purely pragmatic justification: it leads to the desired results, and to no others. But clearly it is not the sort of axiom with which we can rest content. On this subject, however, it cannot be said that a satisfactory solution is as yet obtainable. ... There is another course recommended by Wittgenstein† [† ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'', *5.54ff] for philosophical reasons. This is to assume that functions of propositions are always truth-functions, and that a function can only occur as in a proposition through its values. There are difficulties ... It involves the consequence that all functions of functions are extensional. ... [But the consequences of his logic are that] the theory of infinite Dedekindian and well-ordering collapses, so that irrationals, and real numbers generally, can no longer be adequately dealt with. Also Cantor's proof that 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; ''n'' breaks down unless ''n'' is finite. Perhaps some further axiom, less objectionable than the axiom of reducibility, might give these results, but we have not succeeded in finding such an axiom.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the 2nd Edition 1927 of Whitehead and Russell 1913:xiv&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wittgenstein's 5.54ff is more centred on the notion of [[Function (mathematics)|function]]:

{{quote|5.54
:In the general propositional form, propositions occur in a proposition only as bases of the truth-operations.
5.541
:At first sight it appears as if there were also a different way in which one proposition could occur in another. ¶ Especially in certain propositional forms of psychology, like "A thinks, that ''p'' is the case," or "A thinks ''p''," etc.  ¶ Here it appears superficially as if the proposition ''p'' stood to the object A in a kind of relation.  ¶ (And in modern epistemology [Russell, Moore, etc.] those propositions have been conceived in this way.)
5.542
:But it is clear that "A believes that ''p'', "A thinks ''p''", "A says ''p''", are of the form " ' ''p'' ' thinks ''p'' "; and here we have no co-ordination of a fact and an object, but a co-ordination of facts by means of a co-ordination of their objects.
5.5421 [etc: "A composite soul would not be a soul any longer."]
5.5422
:The correct explanation of the form of the proposition "A judges ''p''" must show that it is impossible to judge a nonsense. (Russell's theory does not satisfy this condition).&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein 1922 in HarperCollins 2009:60&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A possible interpretation of Wittgenstein's stance is that the thinker A i.e. ''{{'}}p{{'}}'' ''is identically'' the thought ''p'', in this way the "soul" remains a unit and not a composite. So to utter "the thought thinks the thought" is nonsense, because per 5.542 the utterance does not specify anything.

===von Neumann 1925===
John von Neumann in his 1925 ''An axiomatisation of set theory'' wrestled with the same issues as did Russell, Zermelo, Skolem, and Fraenkel. He summarily rejected the effort of Russell:

{{quote|Here Russell, J. Konig, Weyl, and Brouwer must be mentioned. They arrived at entirely different results [from the set theorists], but the over-all effect of their activity seems to me outright devastating. In Russell, all of mathematics and set theory seems to rest upon the highly problematic "axiom of reducibility", while Weyl and Brouwer systematically reject the larger part of mathematics and set theory as completely meaningless.&lt;ref&gt; von Neumann 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:395&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He then notes the work of the set theorists Zermelo, Fraenkel and Schoenflies, in which "one understands by "set" nothing but an object of which one knows no more and wants to know no more than what follows about it from the postulates. The postulates [of set theory] are to be formulated in such a way that all the desired theorems of Cantor's set theory follow from them, but not the antinomies.&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann in van Heijenoort 1967:395&lt;/ref&gt;

While he mentions the efforts of [[David Hilbert]] to prove the consistency of his axiomatisation of mathematics&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:395&lt;/ref&gt; von Neumann placed him in the same group as Russell. Rather, von Neumann considered his proposal to be "in the spirit of the second group ... We must, however, avoid forming sets by collecting or separating elements [durch Zusammenfassung oder Aussonderung von Elementen], and so on, as well as eschew the unclear principle of 'definiteness' that can still be found in Zermelo. [...] We prefer, however, to axiomatise not 'set' but 'function'."&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:401&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Heijenoort observes that ultimately this axiomatic system of von Neumann's, "was simplified, revised, and expanded ... and it come to be known as the von Neumann-Bernays-Gödel set theory."&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:394&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Hilbert 1927===
[[David Hilbert]]'s [[Hilbert system|axiomatic system]] that he presents in his 1925 ''The Foundations of Mathematics'' is the mature expression of a task he set about in the early 1900s but let lapse for a while (cf his 1904 ''On the foundations of logic and arithmetic''). His system is neither set theoretic nor derived directly from Russell and Whitehead. Rather, it invokes 13 axioms of logic—four axioms of Implication, six axioms of logical AND and logical OR, 2 axioms of logical negation, and 1 ε-axiom ("existence" axiom)-- plus a version of the [[Peano axioms]] in 4 axioms including [[mathematical induction]], some definitions that "have the character of axioms, and certain ''recursion axioms'' that result from a general recursion schema"&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:467&lt;/ref&gt; plus some formation rules that "govern the use of the axioms".&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:467&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hilbert states that, with regard to this system, i.e. "Russell and Whitehead's theory of foundations[,] ... the foundation that it provides for mathematics rests, first, upon the axiom of infinity and, then upon what is called the axiom of reducibility, and both of these axioms are genuine contentual assumptions that are not supported by a consistency proof; they are assumptions whose validity in fact remains dubious and that, in any case, my theory does not require ... reducibility is not presupposed in my theory ... the execution of the reduction would be required only in case a proof of a contradiction were given, and then, according to my proof theory, this reduction would always be bound to succeed."&lt;ref&gt;Boldface added, Hilbert in van Heijenoort 1967:473&lt;/ref&gt;

It is upon this foundation that modern [[recursion theory]] rests.

===Ramsey 1925===
In 1925, [[Frank Plumpton Ramsey]] argued that it is not needed.&lt;ref&gt;The Foundations of Mathematics (1925), pages 1..61 of ''The Foundations of Mathematics'', F. P. Ramsey, Littlefield Adams &amp; Co, Paterson New Jersey, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; However in the second edition of [[Principia Mathematica]] (1927, page xiv) and in Ramsey's 1926 paper&lt;ref&gt;Mathematical Logic, pages 62..61, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; it is stated that certain theorems about [[real numbers]] could not be proved using Ramsey's approach.  Most later mathematical formalisms (Hilbert's [[Formalism (mathematics)|Formalism]] or [[Brower]]'s [[Intuitionism]] for example) do not use it.

Ramsey showed that it is possible to reformulate the definition of ''predicative'' by using the definitions in [[Wittgenstein]]'s [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]].  As a result, all functions of a given order are ''predicative'', irrespective of how they are expressed.  He goes on to show that his formulation still avoids the paradoxes.  However, the "Tractatus" theory did not appear strong enough to prove some mathematical results.

===Gödel 1944===
[[Kurt Gödel]] in his 1944 ''Russell's mathematical logic'' offers in the words of his commentator Charles Parsons, "[what] might be seen as a defense of these [realist] attitudes of Russell against the reductionism prominent in his philosophy and implicit in much of his actual logical work. It was perhaps the most robust defense of realism about mathematics and its objects since the paradoxes and come to the consciousness of the mathematical world after 1900".&lt;ref&gt;This commentary appears on pages 102–118, and the paper itself on pages 119–141 appears in 1990 ''Kurt Gödel: Collected Works, Volume II'', Oxford University Press, New York, NY, {{ISBN|978-0-19-514721-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In general, Gödel is sympathetic to the notion that a propositional function can be reduced to (identified with) the ''real objects'' that satisfy it, but this causes problems with respect to the theory of real numbers, and even integers (p.&amp;nbsp;134). He observes that the first edition of ''PM'' "abandoned" the realist (constructivistic) "attitude" with his proposal of the axiom of reducibility (p.&amp;nbsp;133). However, within the introduction to the second edition of ''PM'' (1927) Gödel asserts "the constructivistic attitude is resumed again" (p.&amp;nbsp;133) when Russell "dropped" of the axiom of reducibility in favour of the matrix (truth-functional) theory; Russell "stated explicitly that all primitive predicates belong to the lowest type and that the only purpose of variables (and evidently also of constants) is to make it possible to assert more complicated truth-functions of atomic propositions ... [i.e.] the higher types and orders are solely a ''[[wikt:façon de parler|façon de parler]]''" (p.&amp;nbsp;134). But this only works when the number of individuals and primitive predicates is finite, for one can construct finite strings of symbols such as:
:&lt;math&gt;x = a_1 \vee x = a_2 \vee \dots \vee x = a_k&lt;/math&gt; [example on page 134]
And from such strings one can form strings of strings to obtain the equivalent of classes of classes, with a mixture of types possible. However, from such finite strings the whole of mathematics cannot be constructed because they cannot be "analyzed", i.e. reducible to the law of identity or disprovable by a negations of the law:
{{quote|Even the theory of integers is non-analytic, provided that one requires of the rules of elimination that they allow one actually to carry out the elimination in a finite number of steps in each case.&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Because this would imply the existence of a decision procedure for all arithmetical propositions. Cf. ''Turing 1937''.) ... [Thus] the whole of mathematics as applied to sentences of infinite length has to be presupposed to prove [the] analyticity [of the theory of integers], e.g., the axiom of choice can be proved to be analytic only if is assumed to be true. (p. 139)}}

But he observes that "this procedure seems to presuppose arithmetic in some form or other" (p.&amp;nbsp;134), and he states in the next paragraph that "the question of whether (or to what extent) the theory of integers can be obtained on the basis of the ramified hierarchy must be considered as unsolved." (p.&amp;nbsp;135)

Gödel proposed that one should take a "more conservative approach":

{{quote|make the meaning of the terms "class" and "concept" clearer, and to set up a consistent theory of classes and concepts as objectively existing entities. This is the course which the actual development of mathematical logic has been taking ... Major among the attempts in this direction  ... are the simple theory of types ... and axiomatic set theory, both of which have been successful at least to this extent, that they permit the derivation of modern mathematics and at the same time avoid all known paradoxes. Many symptoms show only too clearly, however, that the primitive concepts need further elucidation. (p. 140)}}

===W. V. Quine 1967===
In a critique that also discusses the pros and cons of Ramsey (1931)&lt;ref&gt;W. V. Quine's commentary before Russell 1908 in van Heijenoort 1967:150–152&lt;/ref&gt; Quine calls Russell's formulation of "types" to be "troublesome ... the confusion persists as he attempts to define {{'}}''n''th order propositions'... the method is indeed oddly devious ... the axiom of reducibility is self-effacing", etc.&lt;ref&gt;Quine's commentary before Russell (1908) in van Heijenoort 1967:151&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Kleene Quine observes that Ramsey (1926),&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:532 gives this reference: "Ramsey, F. P. 1926, ''The foundations of mathematics'', Proc. London Math. Soc., ser. 2, vol. 25, pp. 338–384. Reprinted as pp. 1–61 in ''The foundations of mathematics and other logical essays'' by F. P. Ramsey, ed. by R. B. Braithwaite, London (Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner) and new your (Harcourt, brace) 1931. The latter reprinted London (Routledge and Kegan Paul) and New York (Humanities Press) 1950."&lt;/ref&gt; (1931) divided the various paradoxes into two varieties (i) "those of pure set theory" and (ii) those derived from "semantic concepts such as falsity and specifiability", and Ramsey believed that the second variety should have been left out of Russell's solution. Quine ends with the opinion that "because of the confusion of propositions with sentences, and of attributes with their expressions, Russell's purported solution of the semantic paradoxes was enigmatic anyway."&lt;ref&gt;W. V. Quine's commentary before Russell 1908 in van Heijenoort 1967:150–152. Kleene (1952) is less sanguine about the problem of the paradoxes, cf Kleene 1952:43. Kleene 1952 analyzes the situation this way: that Ramsey 1926 classifies the paradoxes as the "logical" versus the "epistomolical or "semantical" and Ramsey observes that the logical antinomies are (apparently) stopped by the simple hierarchy of types, and the semantical ones are (apparently) prevented ... by the absence ... of the requisite means for referring to expressions in the same language. But Ramsey's arguments to justify impredicative definitions within a type entail a conception of the totality of predicates of the type as existing independently of their constructibility or definability"; thus neither Whitehead and Russell nor Ramsey succeeded (see at Kleene 1952)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stephen Kleene 1952===
In his section '''§12. First inferences from the paradoxes''', subchapter "LOGICISM" Kleene (1952) traces the development of Russell's theory of types:
{{quote|To adapt the logicistic [sic] construction of mathematics to the situation arising from the discovery of the paradoxes, Russell excluded impredicative definitions by his ''ramified theory of types'' (1908, 1910).&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:44&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kleene observes that "to exclude impredicative definitions within a type, the types above type 0 [primary objects or individuals "not subjected to logical analysis"] are further separated into orders. Thus for type 1 [properties of individuals, i.e. logical results of the [[propositional calculus]] ], properties defined without mentioning any totality belong to ''order'' 0, and properties defined using the totality of properties of a given order below to the next higher order)".&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:44&lt;/ref&gt;

Kleene, however, parenthetically observes that "the logicistic definition of natural number now becomes predicative when the [property] P in it is specified to range only over properties of a given order; in [this] case the property of being a natural number is of the next higher order".&lt;ref&gt;Slight punctuation changes added for clarity, Kleene 1952:44&lt;/ref&gt; But this separation into orders makes it impossible to construct the familiar analysis, which [see Kleene's example at [[Impredicativity]]] contains impredicative definitions. To escape this outcome, Russell postulated his ''axiom of reducibility''.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:44&lt;/ref&gt; But, Kleene wonders, "on what grounds should we believe in the axiom of reducibility?"&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:45&lt;/ref&gt; He observes that, whereas ''Principia Mathematica'' is presented as derived from ''intuitively''-derived axioms that "were intended to be believed about the world, or at least to be accepted as plausible hypotheses concerning the world[,] ... if properties are to be constructed, the matter should be settled on the basis of constructions, not by an axiom." Indeed, he quotes Whitehead and Russell (1927) questioning their own axiom: "clearly it is not the sort of axiom with which we can rest content".&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:45, quoting from Whitehead and Russell's introduction to their 1927 2nd edition of ''Principia Mathematica''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kleene references work of Ramsey 1926 but notes that "neither Whitehead and Russell nor Ramsey succeeded in attaining the logicistic goal constructively" and "an interesting proposal ... by Langford 1927 and Carnap 1931-2, is also not free of difficulties."&lt;ref&gt;both quotes from Kleene 1952:45&lt;/ref&gt; Kleene ends this discussion with quotes from Weyl (1946) that "the system of ''Principia Mathematica'' ... [is founded on] a sort of logician's paradise" and anyone "who is ready to believe in this 'transcendental world' could also accept the system of axiomatic set theory (Zermelo, Fraenkel, etc), which, for the deduction of mathematics, has the advantage of being simpler in structure."&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:45&lt;/ref&gt;

In a safety management system based upon the [[hierarchy of hazard control]], BBS may be applied to internalise hazard avoidance strategies or [[administrative controls]] (including use of [[personal protective equipment]]), but should not be used in preference to the implementation of reasonably practicable safety measures further up the hierarchy.

To be successful a BBS program must include all employees, from the CEO to the front line workers including hourly, salary, union employees, contractors and sub-contractors. To achieve changes in behavior, a change in policy, procedures and/or systems most assuredly will also need some change. Those changes cannot be done without buy-in and support from all involved in making those decisions.

BBS is not based on assumptions, personal feeling, and/or [[common knowledge]]. To be successful, the BBS program used must be based on [[scientific knowledge]].

'''Black suffrage''' is  [[Black people]]'s [[right to vote]]. Black suffrage has been at issue in countries established under conditions of [[white supremacy]]. It may be limited through official or informal (''[[de facto]]'') discrimination. In many places, black people have obtained suffrage through national independence. It should also be pointed out that "Black suffrage" in the [[United States]] in the aftermath of the [[American Civil War]] explicitly refers to "Black Male Suffrage".  While women citizens, regardless of race, held rights to vote in some states, at the federal level, the U.S. Constitution was not interpreted to prohibit discrimination against women in voting, regardless of their race, until the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] which was ratified by the [[United States Congress]] on August 18 and then certified by law on August 26, 1920.

* Beginning in [[Simon de Montfort's Parliament|1265]], a small number of landed aristocrats and gentry had the right to vote for members of the [[Parliament of England]] and Knights of the Shire. From 1432, only [[forty-shilling freeholders]] held the parliamentary franchise. Suffrage was restricted to males by custom rather than statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The History of the Parliamentary Franchise|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/RP13-14|publisher=House of Commons Library|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=1 March 2013|chapter=Ancient voting rights|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Olaudah Equiano]] and the [[London Corresponding Society]] (founded 1792) argued for expanded suffrage. ''Also see:'' [[Radicalism (historical)]].
* The [[Reform Act 1832]] extended the vote to landed middle class men.
**Incremental reform continued with various [[Reform Act]]s, 
**The [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] ended property qualification for male suffrage.
**The [[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928|Equal Suffrage Act 1928]] ended property qualifications for female suffrage.
*Citizens of [[Crown colony|Crown Colonies]] did not have the right to vote for the government of the British Empire. 
**[[History of Jamaica#British rule: 1655.E2.80.931962|Colonial Jamaica]] sometimes had partial privileges to elect leaders. The [[Constitution of Jamaica]] provides for partial voting rights.
**The British monarchy appointed all leaders of [[Sierra Leone#Colonial era|Colonial Sierra Leone]] until 1953; the [[Sierra Leonean general election, 1962]] was the country's first election with universal suffrage. 
**The [[West Indies Federation]] (1958–1962) was slated to become autonomous but never did; a number of its member states have since achieved autonomy.
* The [[British Nationality Act 1981]] provides [[Commonwealth citizen]]s with legal voting rights.

==South Africa==
{{Further|Black South African}}

===Cape Colony===
* The [[Cape Qualified Franchise]] restricted voting by property ownership but not explicitly by race.
**In 1853, the Queen authorized a Cape Colony parliament, which drafted a [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope#Representative Government .281853.29|Constitution]] with no explicit racial restriction.
**Cape Colony's "[[Responsible Government#Cape Colony|Responsible Government]]" Constitution, issued in 1872, explicitly prohibited racial discrimination.
**Under Prime Minister [[Gordon Sprigg]], the Colony passed the 1877 "Registration Bill", disenfranchising Black communal land owners.
**The [[Franchise and Ballot Act]] of 1892 raised the threshold for suffrage from £25 to £75, accomplishing ''de facto'' disenfranchisement of many non-White voters

===South Africa===
* The [[Representation of Natives Act, 1936]] moved Black South Africans onto separate voter rolls
* [[Apartheid in South Africa]] refers to a period of heavily legislated [[white supremacy]] during which Black suffrage was heavily restricted.
** The [[Coloured vote constitutional crisis]] in the 1950s originated with the [[Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951]], an attempt to revoke suffrage for [[Coloured]] voters. The [[Separate Representation of Voters Amendment Act, 1968]] fully revoked Coloured representation in Parliament, creating the distinct [[Coloured Persons Representative Council]].
** The [[Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, 1959]] ended Black representation in Parliament through the creation of [[Bantustan]]s; Black citizenship was transferred fully to Bantustans by the [[Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act, 1970]] 
** South Africa's [[South African Constitution of 1983|1983 Constitution]], approved by the White-only [[South African constitutional reform referendum, 1983|constitutional reform referendum]], created the [[Tricameral Parliament]], giving representation in separate Chambers to Coloured and [[Indian South Africans|Indian]] voters. Coloured voters were represented in the House of Representatives of South Africa.
* The [[South African Constitution of 1993]], also known as the Interim Constitution, provided for the [[South African general election, 1994]]: the first South African election with [[Universal suffrage]] for adults. The date—27 April—is celebrated as a national holiday called "[[Freedom Day (South Africa)|Freedom Day]]".
* The current [[Constitution of South Africa]], adopted in 1997, protects all citizens' right to vote in [[Chapter Two of the Constitution of South Africa|Chapter Two]].

===Namibia===
* Germany took official control in 1884; it was known as [[German South-West Africa]]. German sovereignty was contested by the [[Khaua-Mbandjeru Rebellion]] and the [[Herero Wars]], which were brutally suppressed.
* South Africa [[South-West Africa Campaign|gained control]] of the area during World War I. It eventually governed [[South-West Africa]] under apartheid laws and divided the area into ten bantustans.
** Many residents recognized [[SWAPO]], not South Africa, as the legitimate authority.  The United Nations recognized SWAPO as Namibia's legitimate representative in 1972.
** The 22-year [[Namibian War of Independence]] culminated in the [[Tripartite Accord (Angola)|New York Accords]] of 1988, leading to Namibia's first free election in November 1989.
* The [[Constitution of Namibia]], adopted in 1990, provides in Article 28 for "direct, universal and equal suffrage".

*Before the Civil War:
**[[Free negro]]es in the U.S. had suffrage in some places.
**[[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s sought an end to slavery, and many demanded further rights such as suffrage.
**''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857) held that persons of African descent were not citizens of the U.S.
**Black suffrage was proposed and defeated in the [[New York state election, 1860]].
* During the [[Reconstruction Era]], the U.S. Congress passed laws favoring Black suffrage; in practice, Blacks still faced obstacles to voting.
** Some of the "[[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]]" passed shortly after the legal abolition of slavery explicitly prevented Blacks from voting. Most of these laws were repealed or invalidated.
** The [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], adopted in 1870, stipulates: "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude."
** The [[Enforcement Acts]] increased federal penalties for voter intimidation, particularly by White terrorist groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref&gt;Everette Swinney, "Enforcing the Fifteenth Amendment, 1870–1877." ''Journal of Southern History'' 28#2 (1962): 202–218. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2205188] &lt;/ref&gt;
*** The 1873 [[Colfax massacre]] occurred when White locals fought with Blacks and federal troops over Black voting in Grant Parish, Louisiana.
*** In ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1876), the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated some of the Enforcement Acts, ruling that the federal government could only intervene to prevent discrimination by [[state actor]]s
** In ''[[United States v. Reese]]'' (1876), the Court upheld voting requirements such as [[literacy test]]s which do not explicitly discriminate on the basis of race.
* [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era]] (''Also see'' [[Jim Crow laws]] ''and'' [[Voting rights in the United States#African Americans and poor whites|Voting rights of African Americans and poor whites]])
** Voting rights were one issue addressed by the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1896–1954)]].
** Black women did not gain the legal right to vote until passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1920. The [[African-American Woman Suffrage Movement]] focused on the particular challenges faced by Black women, even after the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments. ''Also see:'' [[Mary Church Terrell]].
** A group of Black activists formed the [[Niagara Movement]] in 1905, rebuking the [[Atlanta compromise]] and issuing a Declaration which demanded [[universal manhood suffrage]].
** The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] formed in 1910 and pursued voting rights mostly through litigation.
** In ''[[Guinn v. United States]]'' (1915), the Supreme Court struck down a grandfather clause which functionally exempted only White people from literacy tests.
** The Court ruled against [[White primaries]] in ''[[Nixon v. Herndon]]'' (1927) and ''[[Nixon v. Condon]]'' (1932), upheld white primaries in ''[[Grovey v. Townsend]]'' (1935) and finally banned them with ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'' (1944) and ''[[Terry v. Adams]]'' (1953).
** In ''[[Breedlove v. Suttles]]'' (1937), The Court upheld the constitutionality of a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] requirement for voting.
**Florida voting rights activists [[Harriette Moore]] and [[Harry T. Moore]] were assassinated by the KKK in 1951.
* The [[Civil Rights Movement]] brought renewed attention to Black voting rights.
** In ''[[Gomillion v. Lightfoot]]'' (1960) the Supreme Court struck down a plan to redraw district lines of Tuskegee, Alabama, on the grounds that it would disenfranchise Black voters.
** The [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], passed in 1962–1964, banned poll taxes as a precondition for voting in federal elections. The Supreme Court ruled against state poll taxes in ''[[Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections]]'' (1966).
**Civil rights leaders began organized [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954–1968)#Voter registration organizing|campaigns to register Black voters]], including the federally endorsed [[Voter Education Project]].
** A particularly intense voting rights struggle in Mississippi led to the death of [[Medgar Evers]] in 1963 and the [[Freedom Summer]] campaign in 1964. Organizers also created the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] to challenge the White-dominated Mississippi Democratic Party. ''Also see:'' [[Council of Federated Organizations]]'.
** In Alabama, the highly publicized [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] in 1965 met with a violent response, bringing more scrutiny to suppression of Black voters.
** The [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] prohibited a range of discriminatory state voting practices.The Supreme Court upheld this law in ''[[South Carolina v. Katzenbach]]'' (1966).
** Malcolm X delivered his "[[The Ballot or the Bullet]]" speech in 1964.
* Contemporary issues relating to voting rights and [[disenfranchisement]] of Black Americans:
** The practice of [[gerrymandering]] and the creation of [[List of majority minority United States congressional districts|"majority minority" districts]] have sometimes been identified as threats to Black voting rights in the U.S.
***The Supreme Court limits the 1960 ''Gomillion'' decision in ''[[Mobile v. Bolden]]'' (1980), distinguishing between racist effects and racist intent, and prohibiting only the latter.
***The Court ruled in ''[[Shaw v. Reno]]'' (1993) that if a redistricting plan is "so bizarre on its face that it is 'unexplainable on grounds other than race'", it must be held to a "strict scrutiny" standard under the Fourteenth Amendment.
*** The Court has since struck down redistricting plans for racial gerrymandering in ''[[Miller v. Johnson]]'' (1995), ''[[Bush v. Vera]]'' (1996), and several more cases. ''See: [[:Category:United States electoral redistricting case law]]''.
** The film ''[[American Blackout]]'' alleges that disenfranchisement of Black voters in Georgia led to the defeat of Cynthia McKinney in DeKalb County's [[Cynthia McKinney#2002 primary defeat|2002 Democratic primary]].
** The Supreme Court struck down part of the Voting Rights Act in ''[[Shelby County v. Holder]]'' (2013), holding that the racist practices which necessitated the law in 1965 no longer present a problem in 2013.

==France==
* Before the Revolution, only some local elections were held, the first real national suffrage appeared in 1791. 
* From 1791, France installed several male suffrage system, alternating between census and universal suffrage. In mainland France, there was no racial criterion to be a voter so technically from this date, Black (male) voters existed and received the same rights as non-Blacks. They were still rare as segregation on France was not based directly on skin color or racialism but on the status as a slave or as a free human. Later it would be based on status as a mainland citizen or as a colony citizen.
* From there, through the first half of the 19th century, frequent changes in the national government caused the colonies (where most slaves were, as their presence was restricted in mainland France) to have different rules than mainland France, often illegally. Several uprising occurred in the colonies during this period and the colonial rules diverged considerably from mainland France.
* In mainland France:
** In 1794 the government abolished slavery.
** In 1802 Napoleon Bonaparte re-established slavery and, possibly owing to his disagreements with [[Thomas-Alexandre Dumas]], a black general, forbade Blacks and people of mixed-ancestry (''mulâtres'') to enter mainland France.
** In 1815 slave trade was abolished, but not slavery
** In 1848 slavery is formally abolished in France and all slaves are freed.
* In the [[French Colonial Empire]], however, most indigenous people were not recognized as full French citizens and therefore often did not have the right to vote: 
**[[Vincent Ogé]], who had been working in Paris during the Revolution, returned to the island slave colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] and demanded voting rights. Ogé led an insurrection in 1790 and was executed in 1791. Enslaved people took control of the island in the subsequent [[Haitian Revolution|Revolution]] and established the Republic of [[Haiti]]. (Elections were held but [[History of Haiti#Independence: The early years .281804.E2.80.931843.29|the democracy was not stable]].)
**France promoted a [[Assimilation (French colonial)|model of assimilation]] according to which Blacks and indigenous people could gain voting (and other) rights by successfully conforming to French culture. These high-status Blacks were known as ''les [[Évolué]]es''.
** People living in French colonies primarily fell under the ''[[Code de l'indigénat]]''. ''Les'' ''indigènes'' had some voting privileges, but these could be modified without their consent.
**Following the Revolution of 1848, France granted limited representation to the [[Four Communes]] of Senegal. Ordinary residents of these cities gained full voting rights in 1916 after the election of [[Blaise Diagne]].
** [[Lamine Guèye]] (another Senegalese politician) also achieved expanded voting rights ("''loi Lamine Guèye''") for people in the colonies.
**Residents of African colonies were permitted to vote in the [[French constitutional referendum, 1958]], which established the [[French Community]]. Most colonies voted for independence, resulting in the creation of 17 Black nations in the [[Year of Africa]].

==Belgian Congo==
* Blacks in the Belgian Congo voted for the first time in [[Belgian Congo#Political Organization|municipal elections of 1957]].
* The first nationwide election was the [[Belgian Congo general election, 1960]]. ''See also:'' [[Mouvement National Congolais]]
* The assassination of elected President Patrice Lumumba led to years of crisis followed by the Zaire dictatorship. The next free, multi-party election was the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006]].

'''Castigation''' (from the Latin ''castigatio'') or '''chastisement''' (via the French ''châtiment'') is the infliction of severe (moral or corporal) [[punishment]].  One who administers a castigation is a '''castigator''' or ''chastiser''.  

In earlier times, castigation specifically meant restoring one to a religiously pure state, called [[chastity]].  In ancient Rome, it was also a term for the [[magistrate]] called a [[Censor (ancient Rome)|censor]] (in the original sense, rather than the later politicized evolution), who castigated in the name of the pagan state religion but with the authority of the 'pious' state.

In Christian times, this terminology was adopted but roughly restricted to the physical sphere: chastity became a matter of approved sexual conduct, castigation usually meaning [[physical punishment]], either as a form of [[penance]], as a voluntary pious exercise (see [[mortification of the flesh]]) or as educational or other coercion, while the use for other (e.g. verbal) punishments (and criticism etc.) is now often perceived as metaphorical.

'''Self-castigation''' is applied by the repentant culprit to himself, for moral and/or religious reasons, notably as [[penance]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5451">'''Chip formation''' is part of the process of cutting materials by mechanical means, using tools such as [[saw]]s, [[lathe]]s and [[milling machine|milling]] cutters. An understanding of the theory and engineering of this formation is an important part of the development of such machines and their cutting tools.

The formal study of chip formation was encouraged around [[World War II]] and shortly afterwards, with increases in the use of faster and more powerful cutting machines, particularly for metal cutting with the new [[high speed steel]] cutters. Pioneering work in this field was carried out by Kivima (1952) and Franz (1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Chip formation is usually described according to a three-way model developed by Franz. This model is best known within the field of machine tool design, although it is also used when an application area, such as [[woodworking]], requires a vocabulary to describe chip formation in more detail than is usually attempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Chip classification ==
The first three chip types are the original characterisation, by Dr. Norman Franz. The type of chip that forms depends on many factors, of both tool and material. In general, main factors are the angle formed by the edge faces of the tool and also the angle at which this is presented to the surface.

Sharpness of the cutting tool does not usually define the ''type'' of chip, but rather the ''quality'' of the chip, and the clear distinctions between types. A blunt tool produces a degenerate chip that is large, torn and varies from one means of formation to another, often leaving behind a poor quality surface where this means changes.

=== {{visible anchor|Type I chip}} ===
[[File:Chip formation Type I.svg|thumb|Type I chip]]
Type I chips form when a material splits ''ahead'' of the cutting edge, owing to some upwards wedge action of the tool exceeding the [[tensile strength|''tensile'' strength]] of the material, perpendicular to the surface. They are thus particularly important in fibrous materials, such as wood, where individual fibres are strong but they may be levered apart relatively easily. Type I chips generally form in cutting by tools with shallow cutting angles.

Type I chips may form long, continuous [[swarf]], limited in size only by the length of cut.

This is the idealised chip formation for [[wood shaving]]s,&lt;ref name="Elliott, Wood shavings" /&gt; particularly those produced by a well-tuned [[plane (tool)|plane]] with a finely adjusted mouth.

=== {{visible anchor|Type II chip}} ===
[[File:Chip formation Type II.svg|thumb|Type II chip]]
Type II chips form when a shearing force is produced by the wedge of the tool angle. The material fails along a short angled plane, from the apex of the tool edge, diagonally upwards and forwards to the surface. The material deforms along this line, forming an upward curling chip. These chips generally form from intermediate cutting angles.

Type II chips may form in ductile materials, such as metals.

Type II chips may also form long, continuous [[swarf]].

=== {{visible anchor|Type III chip}} ===
[[File:Climb Milling 01.png|thumb|Type III chip formation during [[Milling cutter|climb milling]]]]
Type III chips form a compression failure of the material, ahead of a relatively obtuse cutting angle, approaching 90°. In some weak or non-ductile materials this may form an acceptable chip, usually as a fine dust, but often it gives rise instead to a random "snowplough" effect where the waste material is bunched up ahead of the tool but not cleared decisively away as a well-formed chip.

This type of chip is formed by [[router (woodworking)|router]]s. It is also formed by woodworking scrapers, although when properly sharpened and used, these form such a thin Type III chip that it instead appears as a well-formed Type II chip. Their waste chip is thin enough that the compression failure volume is small enough to act as for the well-defined shear plane of the Type II.

=== {{visible anchor|Type 0 chip}} ===
This type was characterised later, by William McKenzie (1960).{{efn-lr|McKenzie also used the terms Type I and Type II chips, although confusingly these are not the same as Franz'.}}

A '''compressor map''' is a [[chart]] created for a [[gas compressor|compressor]] in a [[gas turbine]] engine. Complete maps are based on compressor rig test results or predicted by a special computer program. Alternatively the map of a similar compressor can be suitably scaled.

Compressor maps are an integral part of predicting the performance of a gas turbine engine, both at design and off-design conditions. Fans and [[turbine]]s also have operating maps, although the latter are significantly different in appearance to that of compressors.

==High pressure compressor map==
[[Image:hpcompressorchic.gif|frame|right|Typical high pressure compressor map]]

===Flow axis===
The x-axis is usually some function of compressor entry mass flow, usually [[corrected flow]] or non-dimensional flow, as opposed to real flow. This axis can be considered a rough measure of the axial Mach number of the flow through the device.

===Pressure ratio axis===
Normally the y-axis is pressure ratio (P&lt;sub&gt;exit&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;inlet&lt;/sub&gt;), where P is stagnation (or total head) pressure.

&amp;Delta;T/T (or similar), where T is stagnation (or total head) temperature, is also used.

===Surge line===
The slightly kinked diagonal line on the main (i.e. lower) part of the map is known as the surge (or stall) line. Above this line is a region of unstable flow, which is an area best avoided.

A [[compressor surge]] typically causes an abrupt reversal of the airflow through the unit, as the pumping action of the [[airfoil]]s [[stall (flight)|stall]] (akin to an aircraft wing stalling).

===Surge margin===
As the name suggests, surge margin provides a measure of how close an operating point is to surge. Unfortunately, there are a number of different definitions of surge margin. A popular one in use is defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt; SM = 100\% \cdot \frac{\dot{m_w} - \dot{m_s}}{\dot{m_w}} &lt;/math&gt;

where:

&lt;math&gt; \dot{m_w} &lt;/math&gt; is the mass flow at the operating point, be it steady state or transient

&lt;math&gt; \dot{m_s} &lt;/math&gt; is the mass flow at surge, at same corrected speed as &lt;math&gt; \dot{m_w} &lt;/math&gt;

===Speed lines===
The slightly curved, near vertical, lines on the main part of the map are the (constant rotational) [[corrected speed]] lines. They are a measure of rotor blade tip [[Mach number]].

Note on the illustration that the speed lines are not distributed linearly with flow. This is because this particular compressor is fitted with variable [[stator]]s, which open progressively as speed increases, causing an exaggerated increase in flow in the medium to high speed region. At low speed, the variable stators are locked, causing a more linear relationship between speed and flow.

Also note that beyond 100% flow, the speed lines close up rapidly, due to choking. Beyond choke, any further increase in speed will generate no further increase in airflow.

===Efficiency axis===
A sub-plot shows the variation of isentropic (i.e. [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]]) efficiency with flow, at constant speed. Some maps use polytropic efficiency. Alternatively, for illustrative purposes, efficiency contours are sometimes [[cross-plot]]ted onto the main map.

Note that the locus of peak efficiency exhibits a slight kink in its upward trend. This is due to the choking-up of the compressor as speed increases, with the variable stators closed-off. The trend line resumes once the variables start to move open.

===Working line===
Also shown on the map is a typical steady state working (or operating/running) line. This is a locus of the operating points of the engine, as it is throttled.

Being a high pressure ratio device, the working line is relatively shallow. If the unit had no variable geometry, there would be handling problems, because the surge line would be very steep and cross the working line at part-flow.

During a slam-acceleration from a mid-throttle setting, the compressor working line will move rapidly towards surge and then slowly approach the steady state operating point, further up the map. The reverse effect occurs during a slam-deceleration. These effects are caused by the sluggish response of the spool (i.e. inertia effects) to rapid changes in engine fuel flow. Compressor surge is a particular problem during slam-accelerations and can be overcome by suitable adjustments to the fueling schedule and/or use of blow-off (bleeding air off the compressor, for handling purposes).

In the particular example shown, a slam-acceleration from ground idle would cause a high-pressure compressor surge. Opening the blow-off would help, but some changes to the variable stator schedule might also be required.

Because a high-pressure compressor 'sees' the choked flow capacity of the high-pressure turbine, the compressor working line is hardly affected by flight conditions. The slope of the working line approximates to a constant corrected outlet flow.

==Fan map==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:fanchic.gif|frame|right|Typical high bypass ratio fan map]] --&gt;
As the second illustration shows, a low pressure ratio fan (such as that used on a high [[bypass ratio]] turbofan) has a range of working lines. At high flight speeds, the ram pressure ratio factors up the cold nozzle pressure ratio, causing the nozzle to choke. Above the choking condition, the working lines tend to coalesce into a unique steep straight line. When the nozzle unchokes, the working line starts to become more curved, reflecting the curvature of the nozzle characteristic. With falling flight Mach number, the cold nozzle pressure ratio decreases. Initially this has no effect upon the position of the working line, apart from the curved (unchoked) tail, which becomes longer. Eventually, the cold nozzle will become unchoked at lower flight Mach numbers, even at full throttle. The working lines will now become curved, gradually migrating towards surge as flight Mach number decreases. The lowest surge margin working line occurs at static conditions.

Owing to the nature of the constraints involved, the fan working lines of a mixed turbofan are somewhat steeper than those of the equivalent unmixed engine.

The fan map shown is for the bypass (i.e. outer) section of the unit. The corresponding inner section map typically has longer, flatter, speed lines.

Military turbofans tend to have a much higher design fan pressure ratio than civil engines. Consequently, the final (mixed) nozzle is choked at all flight speeds, over most of the throttle range. However, at low throttle settings the nozzle will unchoke, causing the lower end of the working lines to have a short curved tail, particularly at low flight speeds.

However, ultra-high bypass ratio turbofans have a very low design fan pressure ratio (e.g. 1.2, on the bypass section). Consequently, even at cruise flight speeds, the cold (or mixed final) propelling nozzle is unchoked. The fan working lines become more spread-out with flight Mach number, because they move bodily up the map, towards the top right hand corner. As a result, the static working line can be well into surge.

One solution is to have a variable area cold (or mixed) nozzle. Increasing the nozzle area at low flight speeds brings the fan working line away from surge.

An alternative solution is to fit a variable pitch fan. Scheduling the pitch of the fan blades has no impact upon the position of the fan working lines, but can be used to move the surge line upwards, to improve fan surge margin.

==IP compressor map==
Some turbofans have an intermediate pressure (IP) compressor located between the fan and the high pressure (HP) compressor to increase overall pressure ratio. US civil engines tend to mount the IP compressor on the LP shaft, directly behind the fan, whereas [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] normally mount the IP compressor on a separate (i.e. IP) shaft, which is driven by an IP turbine. Either way, matching problems can arise.

The IP compressor outlet corrected flow must match the entry corrected flow of the HP compressor, which is decreasing as the engine is throttled back. At a certain IP compressor working line slope, the IP compressor outlet corrected flow remains constant. However, by adopting a shallower working line, the extra IP compressor pressure ratio at a given IP compressor entry corrected flow enables the IP compressor outlet corrected flow to decrease and match up with the falling HP compressor entry corrected flow. Unfortunately this can lead to a poor IP compressor surge margin at part flow. [[Image:ipcompressorwlnoblowoff.gif|center|thumb|600px|IPC working line, with blow-off valve closed throughout throttle range]]

Surge margin can be improved by adding variable stators to the IP compressor and/or adding a [[blow-off valve]] between the IP and HP compressors. The former makes the IP compressor surge line shallower, swinging it away from the shallow working line, thus improving IP compressor surge margin.

At a given IP compressor pressure ratio, opening the blow-off valve forces the IP compressor entry corrected flow to increase, to a point where the IP compressor surge margin tends to be better. Effectively, opening the blow-off valve lowers the IP compressor working line. Any flow surplus to that demanded by the HP compressor passes through the blow-off valve into the bypass duct. The blow-off valve is normally only opened at throttled conditions, since it wastes energy.

In [[mathematics]], a '''conjecture''' is a [[Consequent|conclusion]] or [[proposition]] based on incomplete information, for which no [[Formal proof|proof]] has been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of English|edition=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=JL|title=Shuttling between the particular and the general: reflections on the role of conjecture and hypothesis in the generation of knowledge in science and mathematics.|date=1995|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JyKelnvECc4C&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=%22although+counterpoint+between+the+particular+and+the+general%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hIvE9Onw06&amp;sig=U3DTIi0tkie-oZdllilyAT4y1DE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rAEwUJeZLazqigK3_IHABQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22although%20counterpoint%20between%20the%20particular%20and%20the%20general%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conjectures such as the [[Riemann hypothesis]] (still a conjecture) or [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] (which was a conjecture until proven in 1995 by [[Andrew Wiles]]) have shaped much of mathematical history as new areas of mathematics are developed in order to prove them.

==Important examples==

===Fermat's Last Theorem===
{{main|Fermat's Last Theorem}}
In [[number theory]], [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] (sometimes called '''Fermat's conjecture''', especially in older texts) states that no three [[positive number|positive]] [[integer]]s ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' can satisfy the equation ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for any integer value of ''n'' greater than two.

This theorem was first conjectured by [[Pierre de Fermat]] in 1637 in the margin of a copy of ''[[Arithmetica]]'' where he claimed he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Oystein|last=Ore|title=Number Theory and Its History|year=1988|origyear=1948|publisher=Dover|isbn=978-0-486-65620-5|pages=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem|The first successful proof]] was released in 1994 by [[Andrew Wiles]], and formally published in 1995, after 358 years of effort by mathematicians. The unsolved problem stimulated the development of [[algebraic number theory]] in the 19th century and the proof of the [[modularity theorem]] in the 20th century. It is among the most notable theorems in the [[history of mathematics]] and prior to its proof it was in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' for "most difficult mathematical problems".

===Four color theorem===
{{Main|Four color theorem}}
[[File:Map of United States vivid colors shown.png|thumb|A four-coloring of a map of the states of the United States (ignoring lakes).]]

In [[mathematics]], the [[four color theorem]], or the four color map theorem, states that, given any separation of a plane into [[wikt:contiguity|contiguous]] regions, producing a figure called a ''map'', no more than four colors are required to color the regions of the map so that no two adjacent regions have the same color. Two regions are called ''adjacent'' if they share a common boundary that is not a corner, where corners are the points shared by three or more regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Formal Proof—The Four-Color Theorem |author=Georges Gonthier |journal=Notices of the AMS |volume=55 |issue=11 |date=December 2008 |pages=1382–1393}}From this paper: Definitions: A planar map is a set of pairwise disjoint subsets of the plane, called regions. A simple map is one whose regions are connected open sets. Two regions of a map are adjacent if their respective closures have a common point that is not a corner of the map. A point is a corner of a map if and only if it belongs to the closures of at least three regions. Theorem: The regions of any simple planar map can be colored with only four colors, in such a way that any two adjacent regions have different colors.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the map of the United States of America, Utah and Arizona are adjacent, but Utah and New Mexico, which only share a [[Four Corners Monument|point]] that also belongs to Arizona and Colorado, are not.

[[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]] mentioned the problem in his lectures as early as 1840.&lt;ref name="rouse_ball_1960"&gt;[[W. W. Rouse Ball]] (1960) ''The Four Color Theorem'', in Mathematical Recreations and Essays, Macmillan, New York, pp 222-232.&lt;/ref&gt; The conjecture was first proposed on October 23, 1852&lt;ref name=MacKenzie&gt;Donald MacKenzie, ''Mechanizing Proof: Computing, Risk, and Trust'' (MIT Press, 2004) p103&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Francis Guthrie]], while trying to color the map of counties of England, noticed that only four different colors were needed. The [[five color theorem]], which has a short elementary proof, states that five colors suffice to color a map and was proven in the late 19th century {{Harv|Heawood|1890}}; however, proving that four colors suffice turned out to be significantly harder. A number of false proofs and false [[counterexample]]s have appeared since the first statement of the four color theorem in 1852.

The four color theorem was proven in 1976 by [[Kenneth Appel]] and [[Wolfgang Haken]]. It was the first major [[theorem]] to be [[computer-assisted proof#List of theorems proved with the help of computer programs|proved using a computer]]. Appel and Haken's approach started by showing that there is a particular set of 1,936 maps, each of which cannot be part of a smallest-sized counterexample to the four color theorem. (If they did appear, you could make a smaller counter-example.) Appel and Haken used a special-purpose computer program to confirm that each of these maps had this property. Additionally, any map that could potentially be a counterexample must have a portion that looks like one of these 1,936 maps. Showing this required hundreds of pages of hand analysis, Appel and Haken concluded that no smallest counterexamples exists because any must contain, yet do not contain, one of these 1,936 maps. This contradiction means there are no counterexamples at all and that the theorem is therefore true. Initially, their proof was not accepted by all mathematicians because the [[computer-assisted proof]] was infeasible for a human to check by hand {{Harv|Swart|1980}}. Since then the proof has gained wider acceptance, although doubts remain {{Harv|Wilson|2002|loc=216–222}}.

===Hauptvermutung===
{{main|Hauptvermutung}}

The [[Hauptvermutung]] (German for main conjecture) of [[geometric topology]] is the conjecture that any two [[Triangulation (topology)|triangulations]] of a [[triangulable space]] have a common refinement, a single triangulation that is a subdivision of both of them. It was originally formulated in 1908, by [[Ernst Steinitz|Steinitz]] and [[Heinrich Franz Friedrich Tietze|Tietze]].

This conjecture is now known to be false. The non-manifold version was disproved by [[John Milnor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=John W.|last= Milnor |title=Two complexes which are homeomorphic but combinatorially distinct|journal= [[Annals of Mathematics]]|volume=74|year=1961|issue= 2 |pages=575&amp;ndash;590|mr=133127|doi=10.2307/1970299|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt; |jstor=1970299}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1961 using [[Analytic torsion|Reidemeister torsion]].

The [[manifold]] version is true in [[dimension]]s {{nowrap|1=''m'' ≤ 3}}. The cases {{nowrap|1=''m'' = 2 and 3}} were proved by [[Tibor Radó]] and [[Edwin E. Moise]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Moise | first = Edwin E. | title = Geometric Topology in Dimensions 2 and 3 | publisher = New York : Springer-Verlag | location = New York | year = 1977 | isbn = 978-0-387-90220-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1920s and 1950s, respectively.

===Weil conjectures===
{{main|Weil conjectures}}
In [[mathematics]], the [[Weil conjectures]] were some highly influential proposals  by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=André Weil|first=André |last=Weil|year=1949}} on the [[generating function]]s (known as [[local zeta-function]]s) derived from counting the number of points on [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] over [[finite field]]s.

A variety ''V'' over a finite field with ''q'' elements has a finite number of [[rational point]]s, as well as points over every finite field with ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; elements containing that field. The generating function has coefficients derived from the numbers ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; of points over the (essentially unique) field with ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; elements.

Weil conjectured that such ''zeta-functions'' should be [[rational function]]s, should satisfy a form of [[functional equation]], and should have their zeroes in restricted places. The last two parts were quite consciously modeled on the [[Riemann zeta function]] and [[Riemann hypothesis]]. The rationality was proved by {{harvtxt|Dwork|1960}}, the functional equation by {{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1965}}, and the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis was  proved by {{harvtxt|Deligne|1974}}

===Poincaré conjecture===
{{main|Poincaré conjecture}}
In [[mathematics]], the [[Poincaré conjecture]] is a [[theorem]] about the [[Characterization (mathematics)|characterization]] of the [[3-sphere]], which is the hypersphere that bounds the [[unit ball]] in four-dimensional space. The conjecture states: {{quote|Every [[simply connected]], [[closed manifold|closed]] 3-[[manifold]] is [[homeomorphic]] to the 3-sphere.}} An equivalent form of the conjecture involves a coarser form of equivalence than homeomorphism called [[homotopy equivalence]]: if a 3-manifold is ''homotopy equivalent'' to the 3-sphere, then it is necessarily ''homeomorphic'' to it.

Originally conjectured by [[Henri Poincaré]], the theorem concerns a space that locally looks like ordinary three-dimensional space but is connected, finite in size, and lacks any boundary (a [[Closed manifold|closed]] [[3-manifold]]).  The Poincaré conjecture claims that if such a space has the additional property that each [[path (topology)|loop]] in the space can be continuously tightened to a point, then it is necessarily a three-dimensional sphere.  An [[generalized Poincaré conjecture|analogous result]] has been known in higher dimensions for some time.

After nearly a century of effort by mathematicians, [[Grigori Perelman]] presented a proof of the conjecture in three papers made available in 2002 and 2003 on [[arXiv]]. The proof followed on from the program of [[Richard S. Hamilton]] to use the [[Ricci flow]] to attempt to solve the problem. Hamilton later introduced a modification of the standard Ricci flow, called ''Ricci flow with surgery'' to systematically excise singular regions as they develop, in a controlled way, but was unable to prove this method "converged" in three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hamilton | first = Richard S. | authorlink = Richard S. Hamilton | title = Four-manifolds with positive isotropic curvature | journal = Communications in Analysis and Geometry | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;92 | year = 1997 | doi =  10.4310/CAG.1997.v5.n1.a1| mr = 1456308 | zbl = 0892.53018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perelman completed this portion of the proof.  Several teams of mathematicians have verified that Perelman's proof is correct.

The Poincaré conjecture, before being proven, was one of the most important open questions in [[topology]].

===Riemann hypothesis===
{{main|Riemann hypothesis}}
In mathematics, the [[Riemann hypothesis]], proposed by {{harvs|txt|first=Bernhard|last= Riemann|year=1859|author-link=Bernhard Riemann}}, is a conjecture that the non-trivial [[root of a function|zeros]] of the [[Riemann zeta function]] all have [[real part]] 1/2.  The name is also used for some closely related analogues, such as the [[Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields]].

The Riemann hypothesis implies results about the distribution of [[prime numbers]]. Along with suitable generalizations, some mathematicians consider it the most important unresolved problem in [[pure mathematics]] {{harv|Bombieri|2000}}. The Riemann hypothesis, along with the [[Goldbach conjecture]], is part of [[Hilbert's eighth problem]] in [[David Hilbert]]'s list of [[Hilbert's problems|23 unsolved problems]]; it is also one of the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] [[Millennium Prize Problems]].

===P versus NP problem===
{{main|P versus NP problem}}
The [[P versus NP problem]] is a major [[List of unsolved problems in computer science|unsolved problem in computer science]].  Informally, it asks whether every  problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer; it is widely conjectured that the answer is no.  It was essentially first mentioned in a 1956 letter written by [[Kurt Gödel]] to [[John von Neumann]].  Gödel asked whether a certain NP complete problem could be solved in quadratic or linear time.&lt;ref&gt;Juris Hartmanis 1989, [http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/6910/1/89-994.pdf Gödel, von Neumann, and the P = NP problem], Bulletin of the
European Association for Theoretical Computer Science, vol. 38, pp. 101–107&lt;/ref&gt; The precise statement of the P=NP problem was introduced in 1971 by [[Stephen Cook]] in his seminal paper "The complexity of theorem proving procedures"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cook|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Cook|year=1971|chapter=The complexity of theorem proving procedures|chapterurl=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;id=805047|title=Proceedings of the Third Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing|pages=151–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered by many to be the most important open problem in the field.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lance Fortnow]], [http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/~fortnow/papers/pnp-cacm.pdf ''The status of the '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem''], Communications of the ACM 52 (2009), no.&amp;nbsp;9, pp.&amp;nbsp;78–86. {{doi|10.1145/1562164.1562186}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the seven [[Millennium Prize Problems]] selected by the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] to carry a US$1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution.

===Other conjectures===
* [[Goldbach's conjecture]]
* The [[twin prime conjecture]]
* The [[Collatz conjecture]]
* The [[Manin conjecture]]
* The [[Maldacena conjecture]]
* The [[Euler's sum of powers conjecture|Euler conjecture]], proposed by Euler in the 18th century but for which counterexamples for a number of exponents starting with n=4 were found beginning in the mid 20th century
* The [[Second Hardy–Littlewood conjecture|Hardy-Littlewood conjectures]] are a pair of conjectures concerning the distribution of prime numbers, the first of which expands upon the twin prime conjecture mentioned above.  Neither one has either been proven or disproven, but it ''has'' been proven that both cannot simultaneously be true.  At least one must be false.  It has not been proven which one is false, but it is widely believed that the first conjecture is true and the second one is false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Ian | last=Richards | title=On the Incompatibility of Two Conjectures Concerning Primes | journal=Bull.

* The [[Langlands program]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Langlands|first=Robert|title=Letter to Prof. Weil|year=1967|url=http://publications.ias.edu/rpl/section/21}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a far-reaching web of these ideas  of '[[unifying conjecture]]s' that link different subfields of mathematics, e.g. [[number theory]] and [[representation theory]] of [[Lie group]]s; some of these conjectures have since been proved.

==Resolution of conjectures==

===Proof===
Formal mathematics is based on ''provable'' truth. In mathematics, any number of cases supporting a conjecture, no matter how large, is insufficient for establishing the conjecture's veracity, since a single [[counterexample]] would immediately bring down the conjecture. Mathematical journals sometimes publish the minor results of research teams having extended the search for a counterexample farther than previously done.  For instance, the [[Collatz conjecture]], which concerns whether or not certain [[sequence]]s of [[integer]]s terminate, has been tested for all integers up to 1.2 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; (over a trillion). However, the failure to find a counterexample after extensive search does not constitute a proof that no counterexample exists nor that the conjecture is true, because the conjecture might be false but with a very large minimal counterexample.

Instead, a conjecture is considered proven only when it has been shown that it is logically impossible for it to be false. There are various methods of doing so; see [[Mathematical proof#Methods]] for details.

One method of proof, usable when there are only a finite number of cases that could lead to counterexamples, is known as "brute force": in this approach, all possible cases are considered and shown not to give counterexamples. Sometimes the number of cases is quite large, in which situation a brute-force proof may require as a practical matter the use of a computer algorithm to check all the cases: the validity of the 1976 and 1997 brute-force proofs of the [[four color theorem]] by computer was initially doubted, but was eventually confirmed in 2005 by [[theorem-proving]] software.

When a conjecture has been [[mathematical proof|proven]], it is no longer a conjecture but a [[theorem]]. Many important theorems were once conjectures, such as the [[Geometrization conjecture|Geometrization theorem]] (which resolved the [[Poincaré conjecture]]), [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], and others.

===Disproof===
Conjectures disproven through counterexample are sometimes referred to as ''false conjectures'' (cf. the [[Pólya conjecture]] and [[Euler's sum of powers conjecture]]). In the case of the latter, the first counterexample found for the n=4 case involved numbers in the millions, although subsequently it has been found that the minimal counterexample is smaller than that.

===Undecidable conjectures===
Not every conjecture ends up being proven true or false. The [[continuum hypothesis]], which tries to ascertain the relative [[cardinal number|cardinality]] of certain [[infinite set]]s, was eventually shown to be [[Independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable]] (or independent) from the generally accepted set of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms|axioms of set theory]]. It is therefore possible to adopt this statement, or its negation, as a new [[axiom]] in a consistent manner (much as we can take [[Euclid]]'s [[parallel postulate]] as either true or false).

In this case, if a proof uses this statement, researchers will often look for a new proof that ''doesn't'' require the hypothesis (in the same way that it is desirable that statements in [[Euclidean geometry]] be proved using only the axioms of neutral geometry, i.e. no parallel postulate.) The one major exception to this in practice is the [[axiom of choice]]—unless studying this axiom in particular, the majority of researchers do not usually worry whether a result requires the axiom of choice.

==Conditional proofs==
Sometimes a conjecture is called a ''hypothesis'' when it is used frequently and repeatedly as an assumption in proofs of other results. For example, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] is a conjecture from [[number theory]] that (amongst other things) makes predictions about the distribution of [[prime number]]s. Few number theorists doubt that the Riemann hypothesis is true. In anticipation of its eventual proof, some have proceeded to develop further proofs which are contingent on the truth of this conjecture. These are called ''[[conditional proof]]s'': the conjectures assumed appear in the hypotheses of the theorem, for the time being.

These "proofs", however, would fall apart if it turned out that the hypothesis was false, so there is considerable interest in verifying the truth or falsity of conjectures of this type.

==In other sciences==
[[Karl Popper]] pioneered the use of the term "conjecture" in [[Philosophy of science|scientific philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Karl|title=Conjectures and refutations : the growth of scientific knowledge|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-28594-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conjecture is related to [[hypothesis]], which in [[science]] refers to a testable conjecture.

'''Emotional promiscuity''' has been addressed in both the [[Popular psychology|popular press]] as well as in [[scientific literature]]. 

In the popular press, there was a book published in 2007 entitled, ''Avoid the Heartbreak of Emotional Promiscuity,'' written by Brienne Murk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murk|first=Brienne|title=Avoiding the Heartbreak of Emotional Promiscuity|year=2007|publisher=Regal Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her book, Murk argues that (a) guarding one's heart is required for staying pure, (b) emotions cannot be trusted, and (c) that young people must set physical and emotional boundaries.  Murk also attempts to discourage young people from having premarital sex and engaging in activities she deems impure. The book is written from a Christian perspective, and its assertions based on the author's religious interpretations.

In scientific literature, Jones (2011) examined the concept of ''Emotional Promiscuity'' as a [[Personality psychology|personality]]/[[Differential psychology|individual difference]] construct &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Daniel|title=Emotional Promiscuity: Consequences for health and well-being|url=https://circle.ubc.ca/handle/2429/37893|publisher=University of British Columbia|accessdate=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones defines emotional promiscuity as the predisposition to fall in love easily, fast, and often.  Such individuals tend to love the feeling of [[falling in love]], and want to be with many [[Romance (love)|romantic]] partners.

Emotional promiscuity can be assessed through [[Self-report study|self-report]] using the Emotional Promiscuity Scale (or EP Scale;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Daniel|title=The Emotional Promiscuity Scale|year=2011|publisher=Handbook of Sexuality-Related Measures|location=New York, Routledge|isbn=0415801753|pages=226–227}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is distinct from both [[Promiscuity|sexual promiscuity]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Jeffrey|author2=Gangestad, Steve|title=Individual differences in sociosexuality: Evidence for convergent and discriminant validity.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1991|volume=60|pages=870–883|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.60.6.870}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Attachment theory#Attachment patterns|anxious attachment]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hazan|first=C|author2=Shaver, Phillip|title=Romantic love conceptualized as an attachment process.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1987|volume=52|pages=511–524|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.3.511|pmid=3572722}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition, emotional promiscuity poses a health risk when combined with sexual promiscuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Daniel|author2=Paulhus, Delroy|title=The role of emotional promiscuity in unprotected sex.  |journal=Psychology &amp; Health|year=2012|volume=27|pages=1021–1035|doi=10.1080/08870446.2011.647819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular individuals who fall in love frequently and easily, and who are also comfortable with [[casual sex]], have many [[Safe sex|unprotected sexual]] partners. The authors argue this finding results from premature [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] which eventuates into the faulty perception that protection is unnecessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26469">In mathematics, '''equivalent definitions''' are used in two somewhat different ways. First, within a particular mathematical theory (for example, [[Euclidean geometry]]), a notion (for example, [[Ellipse#Definition|ellipse]] or [[Minimal surface#Definitions|minimal surface]]) may have more than one definition. These definitions are equivalent in the context of a given [[mathematical structure]] ([[Euclidean space]], in this case). Second, a mathematical structure may have more than one definition (for example, [[topological space]] has at least [[Characterizations of the category of topological spaces|seven definitions]]; [[ordered field]] has at least [[Ordered field#Definition|two definitions]]).

In the former case, equivalence of two definitions means that a mathematical object (for example, geometric body) satisfies one definition [[if and only if]] it satisfies the other definition.

In the latter case, the meaning of equivalence (between two definitions of a structure) is more complicated, since a structure is more abstract than an object. Many different objects may implement the same structure.

==Isomorphic implementations==

[[Natural number#Formal definitions|Natural numbers]] may be implemented as 0 = {{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}, 1 = {{mset|0}} = {{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}}}, 2 = {{mset|0, 1}} = {{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}, {{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}}}}}, 3 = {{mset|0, 1, 2}} = {{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}, {{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}}}, {{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}, {{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}}}}}}} and so on; or alternatively as 0 = {{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}, 1 = {{mset|0}} ={{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}}}, 2 = {{mset|1}} = {{mset|{{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}}}}} and so on. These are two different but [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] implementations of natural numbers in set theory.
They are isomorphic as models of [[Peano axioms#Models|Peano axioms]], that is, triples (''N'',0,''S'') where ''N'' is a set, 0 an element of ''N'', and ''S'' (called the [[successor function]]) a map of ''N'' to itself (satisfying appropriate conditions). In the first implementation ''S''(''n'') = ''n'' ∪ {{mset|''n''}}; in the second implementation ''S''(''n'') = {{mset|''n''}}. As emphasized in [[Benacerraf's identification problem]], the two implementations differ in their answer to the question whether 0 ∈ 2; however, this is not a legitimate question about natural numbers (since the relation ∈ is not stipulated by the relevant signature(s), see the next section).&lt;ref group="details"&gt;Technically, "0 ∈ 2" is an example of a non-transportable relation, see {{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.3}}, {{harvnb|Marshall|Chuaqui|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, different but isomorphic implementations are used for [[Complex number#Formal construction|complex numbers]].

==Deduced structures and cryptomorphisms==

The successor function ''S'' on natural numbers leads to [[Peano axioms#Arithmetic|arithmetic operations]], addition and multiplication, and the total order, thus endowing ''N'' with an [[Peano axioms#Equivalent axiomatizations|ordered semiring]] structure. This is an example of a deduced structure. The ordered semiring structure (''N'', +, ·, ≤) is deduced from the Peano structure (''N'', 0, ''S'') by the following procedure:
''n'' + 0 = ''n'', &amp;nbsp; ''m'' + S (''n'') = S (''m'' + ''n''), &amp;nbsp; ''m'' · 0 = 0, &amp;nbsp; ''m'' · S (''n'') = ''m'' + (''m'' · ''n''), and ''m'' ≤ ''n'' if and only if there exists ''k'' ∈ ''N'' such that ''m'' + ''k'' = ''n''. And conversely, the Peano structure is deduced from the ordered semiring structure as follows: ''S'' (''n'') = ''n'' + 1, and 0 is defined by 0 + 0 = 0. It means that the two structures on ''N'' are equivalent by means of the two procedures.

The two isomorphic implementations of natural numbers, mentioned in the previous section, are isomorphic as triples (''N'',0,''S''), that is, structures of the same [[Signature (logic)|signature]] (0,''S'') consisting of a constant symbol 0 and a unary function ''S''. An ordered semiring structure (''N'', +, ·, ≤) has another signature (+, ·, ≤) consisting of two binary functions and one binary relation. The notion of isomorphism does not apply to structures of different signatures. In particular, a Peano structure cannot be isomorphic to an ordered semiring. However, an ordered semiring deduced from a Peano structure may be isomorphic to another ordered semiring. Such relation between structures of different signatures is sometimes called a [[cryptomorphism]].

==Ambient frameworks==

A structure may be implemented within a set theory [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]], or another set theory such as [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]], [[New Foundations|NFU]], [[Elementary theory of the category of sets|ETCS]].&lt;ref&gt;About ETCS see [[Type theory#Mathematical foundations]]&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, a structure may be treated in the framework of [[first-order logic]], [[second-order logic]], [[higher-order logic]], a [[type theory]], [[homotopy type theory]] etc.&lt;ref group="details"&gt;A reasonable choice of an ambient framework should not alter basic properties of a structure, but can alter provability of finer properties. For example, some theorems about the natural numbers are provable in set theory (and some other strong systems) but not provable in first-order logic; see [[Paris–Harrington theorem]] and [[Goodstein's theorem]]. The same applies to definability; see for example [[Tarski's undefinability theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structures according to Bourbaki==

:"Mathematics [...] cannot be explained completely by a single concept such as the mathematical structure. Nevertheless, Bourbaki's structuralist approach is the best that we have." ({{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=page 3}})

:"Evident as the notion of mathematical structure may seem these days, it was at least not made explicit until the middle of the 20th century. Then it was the influence of the Bourbaki-project and then later the development of category theory which made the notion explicit" ([http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/structure#related_entries nLab]).

According to [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]], the scale of sets on a given set ''X'' consists of all sets arising from ''X'' by taking [[Cartesian product]]s and [[power set]]s, in any combination, a finite number of times. Examples: ''X''; ''X'' × ''X''; ''P''(''X''); ''P''(''P''(''X'' × ''X'') × ''X'' × ''P''(''P''(''X''))) × ''X''. (Here ''A'' × ''B'' is the product of ''A'' and ''B'', and ''P''(''A'') is the powerset of ''A''.) In particular, a pair (0,''S'') consisting of an element 0 ∈ ''N'' and a unary function ''S'' : ''N'' → ''N'' belongs to ''N'' × ''P''(''N'' × ''N'') (since [[Function (mathematics)#Definition|a function is a subset of the Cartesian product]]). A triple (+, ·, ≤) consisting of two binary functions ''N'' × ''N'' → ''N'' and one binary relation on ''N'' belongs to ''P''(''N'' × ''N'' × ''N'')  × ''P''(''N'' × ''N'' × ''N'')  × ''P''(''N'' × ''N''). Similarly, every algebraic structure on a set belongs to the corresponding set in the scale of sets on ''X''.

Non-algebraic structures on a set ''X'' often involve sets of subsets of ''X'' (that is, subsets of ''P''(''X''), in other words, elements of ''P''(''P''(''X''))). For example, the structure of a [[topological space]], called a topology on ''X'', treated as [[Topological space#Open sets definition|the set of "open" sets]]; or the structure of a measurable space, treated as the [[Sigma-algebra|σ-algebra]] of "measurable" sets; both are elements of ''P''(''P''(''X'')). These are second-order structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=pages 10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More complicated non-algebraic structures combine an algebraic component and a non-algebraic component. For example, the structure of a [[topological group]] consists of a topology and the structure of a group. Thus it belongs to the product of ''P''(''P''(''X'')) and another ("algebraic") set in the scale; this product is again a set in the scale.

===Transport of structures; isomorphism===

{{main article|Transport of structure}}

Given two sets ''X'', ''Y'' and a [[bijection]] ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'', one constructs the corresponding bijections between scale sets. Namely, the bijection ''X'' × ''X'' → ''Y'' × ''Y'' sends (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to (''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;),''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)); the bijection ''P''(''X'') → ''P''(''Y'') sends a subset ''A'' of ''X'' into its [[Image (mathematics)|image]] ''f''(''A'') in ''Y''; and so on, recursively: a scale set being either product of scale sets or power set of a scale set, one of the two constructions applies.

Let (''X'',''U'') and (''Y'',''V'') be two structures of the same signature. Then ''U'' belongs to a scale set ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''V'' belongs to the corresponding scale set ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;. Using the bijection ''F'' : ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; constructed from a bijection ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'', one defines:
: ''f'' is an ''isomorphism'' between (''X'',''U'') and (''Y'',''V'') if ''F''(''U'') = ''V''.
This general notion of isomorphism generalizes many less general notions listed below.

* For [[projective space]]s: [[homography]].
In fact, Bourbaki stipulates two additional features. First, several sets ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (so-called principal base sets) may be used, rather than a single set ''X''. However, this feature is of little use. All the items listed above use a single principal base set. Second, so-called auxiliary base sets ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; may be used. This feature is widely used. Indeed, the structure of a vector space stipulates not only addition ''X'' × ''X'' → ''X'' but also scalar multiplication '''R''' × ''X'' → ''X'' (if '''R''' is the field of scalars). Thus, '''R''' is an auxiliary base set (called also "external"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=page 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The scale of sets consists of all sets arising from all base sets (both principal and auxiliary) by taking Cartesian products and power sets. Still, the map ''f'' (possibly an isomorphism) acts on ''X'' only; auxiliary sets are endowed by identity maps. (However, the case of ''n'' principal sets leads to ''n'' maps.)

===Functoriality===

Several statements formulated by Bourbaki without mentioning categories can be reformulated readily in the language of [[category theory]]. First, some terminology. 
* The scale of sets is indexed by "echelon construction schemes",&lt;ref name="B-IV.1.1"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; called also "types".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=page 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marshall|Chuaqui|1991|loc=§2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One may think of, say, the set ''P''(''P''(''X'' × ''X'') × ''X'' × ''P''(''P''(''X''))) × ''X'' as a set ''X'' substituted into the formula "''P''(''P''(''a'' × ''a'') × ''a'' × ''P''(''P''(''a''))) × ''a''" for the variable ''a''; this formula is the corresponding echelon construction scheme.&lt;ref group="details"&gt;In order to be more formal, Bourbaki encodes such formulas with sequences of ordered pairs of natural numbers.&lt;/ref&gt; (This notion, defined for all structures, may be thought of as a generalization of the signature defined only for algebraic structures.)&lt;ref group="details"&gt;On one hand, it is possible to exclude the Cartesian products, treating a pair (''x'',''y'') as just the set {{''x''},{''x'',''y''}}. On the other hand, it is possible to include the set operation ''X'',''Y''-&gt;''Y''&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt; (all functions from ''X'' to ''Y''). "It is possible to simplify the matter by considering operations and functions as a special kind of relations (for example, a binary operation is a ternary relation). However, quite often, it is an advantage to have operations as a primitive concept."  {{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=page 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Let '''Set*''' denote the [[groupoid]] of sets and bijections. That is, the category whose objects are (all) sets, and morphisms are (all) bijections.

''Proposition.'' &lt;ref name="B-IV.1.2"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each echelon construction scheme leads to a functor from '''Set*''' to itself.

In particular, the [[permutation group]] of a set ''X'' [[Group action|acts]] on every scale set ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;.

In order to formulate one more proposition, the notion "species of structures" is needed, since echelon construction scheme gives only preliminary information on a structure. For example, commutative groups and (arbitrary) groups are two different species of the same echelon construction scheme. Another example: topological spaces and measurable spaces. They differ in the so-called axiom of the species. This axiom is the conjunction of all required properties, such as "multiplication is associative" for groups, or "the union of open sets is an open set" for topological spaces.
* A species of structures consists of an echelon construction scheme and an axiom of the species.

''Proposition.'' &lt;ref name="B-IV.1.5"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each species of structures leads to a functor from '''Set*''' to itself.

Example. For the species of groups, the functor ''F'' maps a set ''X'' to the set ''F''(''X'') of all group structures on ''X''. For the species of topological spaces, the functor ''F'' maps a set ''X'' to the set ''F''(''X'') of all topologies on ''X''. The morphism ''F''(''f'') : ''F''(''X'') → ''F''(''Y'') corresponding to a bijection ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is the transport of structures. Topologies on ''Y'' correspond bijectively to topologies on ''X''. The same holds for group structures, etc.

In particular, the set of all structures of a given species on a given set is invariant under the action of the permutation group on the corresponding scale set ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, and is a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of the action of the group on another scale set ''P''(''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;). However, not all fixed points of this action correspond to species of structures.&lt;ref group="details"&gt;The set of all possible axioms of species is [[Countable set|countable]], while the set of all fixed points of the considered action may be uncountable. Tarski's "[[Alfred Tarski#What are logical notions?|logical notions of higher order]]" are closer to the fixed points than to species of structures, see {{harvnb|Feferman|2010}} and references therefrom.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given two species, Bourbaki defines the notion "procedure of deduction" (of a structure of the second species from a structure of the first species).&lt;ref name="B-IV.1.6"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pair of mutually inverse procedures of deduction leads to the notion "equivalent species".&lt;ref name="B-IV.1.7"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Example. The structure of a topological space may be defined as an [[Topological space#Open sets definition|open set topology]] or alternatively, a [[Topological space#Closed sets definition|closed set topology]]. The two corresponding procedures of deduction coincide; each one replaces all given subsets of ''X'' with their complements. In this sense, these are two equivalent species.

In the general definition of Bourbaki, deduction procedure may include a change of the principal base set(s), but this case is not treated here. In the language of category theory one have the following result.

''Proposition.'' &lt;ref name="B-IV.1.7" /&gt; Equivalence between two species of structures leads to a [[Natural transformation#Definition|natural isomorphism]] between the corresponding functors.

However, in general, not all natural isomorphisms between these functors correspond to equivalences between the species.&lt;ref group="details"&gt;The set of all possible deduction procedures is countable, while the set of all natural isomorphisms between the considered functors may be uncountable (see an example in Section [[#Canonical, not just natural]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical practice==

:"We often do not distinguish structures that are isomorphic and often say that {{'}}''two structures are the same, up to isomorphism''{{'}}."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=page 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"When studying structures we are interested only in their form, but when we prove their existence we need to construct them."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=page 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'Mathematicians are of course used to identifying isomorphic structures in practice, but they generally do so by "abuse of notation", or some other informal device, knowing that the objects involved are not "really" identical.'&lt;ref name="HoTT"&gt;{{harvnb|The Univalent Foundations Program|2013|loc=Subsection "Univalent foundations" of Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A radically better approach is expected; but for now, Summer 2014, the definitive book quoted above does not elaborate on structures.)

In practice, one makes no distinction between equivalent species of structures.&lt;ref name="B-IV.1.7" /&gt;

Usually, a text based on natural numbers (for example, the article "[[prime number]]") does not specify the used definition of natural numbers. Likewise, a text based on topological spaces (for example, the article "[[homotopy]]", or "[[inductive dimension]]") does not specify the used definition of a topological space. Thus, it is possible (and rather probable) that the reader and the author interpret the text differently, according to different definitions. Nevertheless, the communication is successful, which means that such different definitions may be thought of as equivalent.

A person acquainted with topological spaces knows basic relations between neighborhoods, convergence, continuity, boundary, closure, interior, open sets, closed sets, and does not need to know that some of these notions are "primary", stipulated in the definition of a topological space, while others are "secondary", characterized in terms of "primary" notions. Moreover, knowing that subsets of a topological space are themselves topological spaces, as well as products of topological spaces, the person is able to construct some new topological spaces irrespective of the definition.

Thus, in practice a topology on a set is treated like an [[abstract data type]] that provides all needed notions (and [[Constructor (object-oriented programming)|constructors]]) but hides the distinction between "primary" and "secondary" notions. The same applies to other kinds of mathematical structures. "Interestingly, the formalization of structures in set theory is a similar task as the formalization of structures for computers."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=page 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canonical, not just natural==

As was mentioned, equivalence between two species of structures leads to a natural isomorphism between the corresponding functors. However, "[[Natural transformation|natural]]" does not mean "[[Canonical map|canonical]]". A natural transformation is generally non-unique.

Example. Consider again the two equivalent structures for natural numbers. One is the "Peano structure" (0,''S''), the other is the structure (+, ·, ≤) of ordered semiring. If a set ''X'' is endowed by both structures then, on one hand, ''X'' = {{mset| ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... }} where ''S''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n'' and 0 = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;; and on the other hand, ''X'' = {{mset| ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... }} where ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''+''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''·''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; · ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;  ≤''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if ''m'' ≤ ''n''. Requiring that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n'' one gets the canonical equivalence between the two structures. However, one may also require ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n'' &gt; 1, thus getting another, non-canonical, natural isomorphism. Moreover, every [[permutation]] of the index set {{mset| 0, 1, 2, ... }} leads to a natural isomorphism; they are uncountably many!

Another example. A structure of a (simple) graph on a set ''V'' = {{mset| 1, 2, ..., n }} of vertices may be described by means of its [[adjacency matrix]], a (0,1)-matrix of size ''n''×''n'' (with zeros on the diagonal). More generally, for arbitrary ''V'' an adjacency function on ''V'' × ''V'' may be used. The canonical equivalence is given by the rule: "1" means "connected" (with an edge), "0" means "not connected". However, another rule, "0" means "connected", "1" means "not", may be used, and leads to another, natural but not canonical, equivalence. In this example, canonicity is rather a matter of convention. But here is a worse case. Instead of "0" and "1" one may use, say, the two possible orientations of the plane '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ("clockwise" and "counterclockwise"). It is difficult to choose a canonical rule in this case!

"Natural" is a well-defined mathematical notion, but it does not ensure uniqueness. "Canonical" does, but generally is more or less conventional. A consistent choice of canonical equivalences is an inevitable component of equivalent definitions of mathematical structures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4444">'''Existentiell''' and [[existential]] are necessary discursive concepts used in the [[fundamental ontology]] of [[Dasein]]; whereby the former (ontic-existentiell) describes  its ontic characteristics whilst the latter is an ontological-existential interpretation of the former&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1927, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;. This, in its perspicuity is presented in ''[[Being and Time]]'' in "The Ontic Priority of the Question of Being"&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1927, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;. Therein, Dasein's priority and with it the need for different discursive concepts shows itself.   

==Etymology==
Heidegger did not coin the term "existentiell". The common German word "existenziell" is usually translated into English as "existential". However, in Heidegger's works, he coined the ''German'' word "existenzial", giving it a meaning distinct from the common German word "existenziell". In English translations of Heidegger, then, the ''German'' "existenziell" is [[transliteration| transliterated]] as "existentiell" in English, and the ''German'' word "existenzial" is transliterated as "existential", each word having its own technical meaning specific to Heidegger.

==Definition==
The two terms; ontic-existentiell and ontological-existential are related in that an ontic determination is inherently ontological. As an example, the ontic distinction of Dasein that “in its being this being is concerned about its very being (as a) determination of being of Da-sein... lies in the fact that it is ontological&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1927, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Dasein]]'s distinction makes its being (existence’s) “essential definition not to be accomplished by ascribing to it a "what" that specifies its material content” &lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1927, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;. ''[[Being and Time]]'' as a question of being preceded by [[fundamental ontology]] had realized that “What is primarily interrogated in the question of the meaning of being is that being which has the character of Da-sein”&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1927, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;. This means that, since existence defines Da-sein, "the ontological analysis of this being always requires a previous glimpse of existentiality”&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1927, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;. Dasein can relate to it in an ontic-existentiell or ontological-existential manner. The ontic-existentiell relation “is an ontic "affair" of Da-sein ... in the manner of seizing upon or neglecting such possibilities ... only through existence itself”&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1927, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;. From this one derives an “existentiell understanding”&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 2009, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, an existentiell is an ontic understanding or characterization of existence.

The second relation regards the “theoretical transparency of the ontological structure of existence ... [and] aims at the analysis of what constitutes existence”&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1927, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;. Its understanding is rather existential. It is important to note that “Because these explications are defined in terms of existentiality, we shall call the characteristics of being of Da-sein existentials. They are to be sharply delimited from the determinations of being of those beings unlike Da-sein which we call categories.”&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1927, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;. The above understanding is limited to Dasein alone due to its qualitative distinction from other beings. It cannot be used to describe an ontic understanding of beings in the world nor it addresses the facts about things in the context of the world. They are limited to Dasein and Dasein alone. It should be kept in mind that “Existentials and categories are the two fundamental possibilities of the characteristics of being. The being which corresponds to them requires different ways of primary interrogation. Beings are a who (existence) or else a what (objective presence in the broadest sense).”&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1927, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation==
''Being and Time'' notes that "the roots of the existential analysis, for their part, are ultimately existentiell -they are ontic"&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1927, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;. This means that an existential analysis derives its directives from an existentiell and it is itself grounded in an existentiell character of Dasein.

The "Friendship Bench" is a tool for positive mental and emotional health used in various settings.

In Zimbabwe, the Friendship Bench approach to therapy uses listening and "problem-solving therapy" by trained lay-counselor grandmothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-friendship-bench-mental-health-treatment/3661639.html|title=Zimbabwe Tackles Mental Health With 'Friendship Benches'|last=Ridgwell|first=Henry|work=VOA|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When seeking mental health care is stigmatized or resources are not available—Zimbabwe has just 12 psychiatrists for 14 million people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-friendship-bench-mental-health-treatment/3661639.html|title=Zimbabwe Tackles Mental Health With 'Friendship Benches'|last=Ridgwell|first=Henry|work=VOA|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the Friendship Bench offers what so far seems to be an effective and simple option.  Depression is referred to as  ''kufungisisa,'' “thinking too much," in the Shona language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/apr/14/harare-friendship-bench-grandmothers-mental-health-zimbabwe|title=Harare's park bench grandmas: 'I speak to them and feel a load is lifted off my heart'|last=Harare|first=Ranga Mberi in|date=2017-04-14|website=the Guardian|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a school setting a '''friendship bench''' may also be known as a '''buddy bench''', and is a special place in a [[school]] [[playground]] where a child can go when they want someone to talk to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/buddy-bench-willowgrove-school-1.3505066 Buddy Bench, CBC Saskatoon, March 24, 2016].  Retrieved 2016-04-05&lt;/ref&gt;

Friendship benches may be distinctively different from other seating in the [[school]] and may be specially designed by an artist or with the help of the children themselves. They are rainbow colored and were originally created by C.R Plastics, a Canadian company that creates recycled plastic outdoor furniture. Such benches are situated in open and well-travelled areas of the school so that any child using the bench will be noticed quickly.

When a [[child]] feels the need for a friend to talk to, he or she can show this by using the friendship bench. Other children and staff will recognise this as a sign that some help, support or comfort is needed and will come to talk with the child.

The friendship bench is a means by which a child can seek support without the need to rationalise their feelings or to seek-out a particular member of staff or special friend. Because the bench is in the day-to-day environment of the school it can be used at any time and for any reason—from seemingly trivial matters to more serious concerns—and encourages children to ask for help when they are troubled.

The Friendship Benches were originally created in 2012 by a fifth grader, at the time, Acacia Woodley. Acacia now speaks at schools across North America and is very happily the founder and CEO of company, Tiny Girl, Big Dream.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6866">In [[computer science]], a '''function type''' (or '''arrow type''' or '''exponential''') is the type of a [[variable (computer science)|variable]] or [[parameter (computer science)|parameter]] to which a [[function (computer science)|function]] has or can be assigned, or an argument or result type of a [[higher-order function]] taking or returning a function.

A function type depends on the type of the parameters and the result type of the function (it, or more accurately the unapplied [[type constructor]] &lt;code&gt;{{nowrap|· → ·}}&lt;/code&gt;, is a [[higher-kinded type]]). In theoretical settings and [[programming language]]s where functions are defined in [[curried form]], such as the [[simply typed lambda calculus]], a function type depends on exactly two types, the [[domain of a function|domain]] ''A'' and the [[range of a function|range]] ''B''. Here a function type is often denoted {{math|''A'' → ''B''}}, following mathematical convention, or {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, based on there existing exactly {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt;}} (exponentially many) [[function space|set-theoretic functions]] mappings ''A'' to ''B'' in the [[category of sets]]. The class of such maps or functions is called the [[exponential object]]. The act of [[currying]] makes the function type [[adjoint functor|adjoint]] to the [[product type]]; this is explored in detail in the article on currying.

The function type can be considered to be a special case of the [[Dependent type#Formal definition|dependent product type]], which among other properties, encompasses the idea of a [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphic function]].

== Programming languages ==
The syntax used for function types in several programming languages can be summarized, including an example type signature for the higher-order [[function composition (computer science)|function composition]] function:

|-
| [[C++11]]

| {{code|2=cpp|function&lt;function&lt;int(int)&gt;(function&lt;int(int)&gt;, function&lt;int(int)&gt;)&gt; compose;}}

|}

When looking at the example type signature of, for example C#, the type of the function {{code|compose}} is actually &lt;code&gt;Func&lt;Func&lt;A,B&gt;,Func&amp;lt;B,C&gt;,Func&lt;A,C&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

Due to [[type erasure]] in C++11's &lt;code&gt;std::function&lt;/code&gt;, it is more common to use [[Template (C++)|templates]] for higher order function parameters and type inference (&lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt;) for closures.

== Denotational semantics ==
The function type in programming languages does not correspond to the space of all set-theoretic functions. Given the [[countably infinite]] type of [[natural number]]s as the domain and the booleans as range, then there are an [[uncountably infinite]] number (2&lt;sup&gt;ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = [[Cardinality of the continuum|c]]) of set-theoretic functions between them. Clearly this space of functions is larger than the number of functions that can be defined in any programming language, as there exist only countably many programs (a program being a finite sequence of a finite number of symbols) and one of the set-theoretic functions effectively solves the [[halting problem]].

[[Denotational semantics]] concerns itself with finding more appropriate models (called [[domain theory|domains]]) to model programming language concepts such as function types. It turns out that restricting expression to the set of [[computable function]]s is not sufficient either if the programming language allows writing [[non-terminating computation]]s (which is the case if the programming language is [[Turing complete]]). Expression must be restricted to the so-called ''[[Continuous functions#Continuous functions between partially ordered sets|continuous functions]]'' (corresponding to continuity in the [[Scott topology]], not continuity in the real analytical sense). Even then, the set of continuous function contains the ''parallel-or'' function, which cannot be correctly defined in all programming languages.

'''Holocentric''' is a [[philosophical]] position which focuses on solutions as the outcome of [[human agency]] and on [[critical thinking]].

One of the four fundamental [[worldview]] types proposed by Richard Bawden in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;Bawden, R. J. [http://www.learningtolearn.sa.edu.au/Colleagues/files/links/ScenarioSystemManual.pdf  “The community challenge: The learning response”], Invited Plenary Paper at Annual Conference of the Community Development Society, Athens, Georgia, August 1997&lt;/ref&gt; the other three being [[Technocentrism|Technocentric]], [[Ecocentric]], and [[Egocentric]].

Drawing on ideas introduced by Burrell and Morgan &lt;ref&gt;Burrell, W.G. and Morgan, G. (1979) “Sociological Paradigms and Organisational Analysis Heinemann London”&lt;/ref&gt; and Miller,&lt;ref&gt;Miller, A. (1983) “The Influence of Personal Biases on Environmental Problem-solving” Journal of Environmental Management 17: 133-142&lt;/ref&gt; Bawden developed the notion of a worldview [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] in which the four viewpoints represent the basic philosophical positions of members in a community of interest considering an [[ontological]] dimension (with [[holism]] and [[reductionism]] along the x axis) and an [[epistemological]] dimension (with [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivism]] and [[relativism]]/[[contextualism]] along the y axis).

The so-called, Miller / Bawden Quadrants can be utilized as a framework to assist in the collaborative dialog of any cooperative endeavor and the positioning of the holocentric quadrant at the intersection of holism and relativism distinguishes it uniquely as a view which accommodates both the complex and often non-specific interactions that lie at the heart of any social group.

In a community’s response to [[SWOT analysis|threats and opportunities]], the formulation of [[strategy]] will typically evolve through a dialog between stakeholder members holding different viewpoints. In a holocentric approach, the resulting strategy will include holistic characteristics in that the solution will reflect the constituent positions within the community with the addition of the creative tension that is contributed through the negotiation process. Through the dialog process, [[emergent properties]] arise in the strategy due to the interplay between the various stakeholder viewpoints.

In order to improve the effectiveness of a community’s responses, consideration must be given to techniques which can deal with complex systems and the advancement of critical thinking skills. Such techniques often employ aspects of [[systems thinking]] to help community members better appreciate and deal with the [[Complex system|complex]] interdependencies and conflicts that arise between  stakeholder views.

As the community becomes more effective in the process of dialog, it may become more [[Self-awareness|self-aware]], and this ‘systemic’ heightening of awareness may lead to additional emergent properties which in turn may further increase the overall level of understanding and quality of the community response.

Within a cooperative community, the [[catalyst]]s for the emergent understanding are the insights gained through inspirational learning and the abstract concepts learned through [[Experiential education|experiential learning]].

Educational approaches aimed at managing the critical learning process through the application of the Miller / Bawden Quadrants have been used in a number of different domains, most commonly those in which a wide variety of stakeholders are forced to formulate strategies dealing with limited natural resources. In this environment, agreement amongst sufficiently powerful stakeholders in any community will inevitably involve negotiated trade-offs, for example between productivity, equity, sustainability and stability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/assessment/FILES/word/proposals/challengeprogram/CP-Water-CN.doc WORKSHOP ON NATIONAL AND BASIN LEVEL DIALOGUE, BONN, DECEMBER 1 AND 2, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hornbostel–Sachs''' or '''Sachs–Hornbostel''' is a system of [[musical instrument classification]] devised by [[Erich Moritz von Hornbostel]] and [[Curt Sachs]], and first published in the ''Zeitschrift für Ethnologie'' in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Volume 46 (1914) of the ''Zeitschrift'' is available online in a [https://archive.org/details/zeitschriftfre46berluoft variety of formats], as part of the digital [https://archive.org/search.php?query=collection%3A%22toronto%22 collection] of the [[University of Toronto]]. The article by Hornbostel and Sachs is to be found on pages 553–90.&lt;/ref&gt; An English translation was published in the ''[[Galpin Society|Galpin Society Journal]]'' in 1961. It is the most widely used system for classifying [[musical instruments]] by [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologists]] and [[organology|organologists]] (people who study musical instruments). The system was updated in 2011 as part of the work of the Musical Instrument Museums Online (MIMO) Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Evénement |url=http://www.mimo-international.com |title=MIMO Project - Musical Instrument Museums Online |publisher=Mimo-international.com |date= |accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hornbostel and Sachs based their ideas on a system devised in the late 19th century by [[Victor-Charles Mahillon]], the curator of musical instruments at [[Brussels Conservatory]]. Mahillon divided instruments into four broad categories according to the nature of the sound-producing material: an air column; string; membrane; and body of the instrument. From this basis, Hornbostel and Sachs expanded Mahillon's system to make it possible to classify any instrument from any culture.

Formally, the Hornbostel–Sachs is modeled on the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] for libraries. It has five top-level classifications, with several levels below those, adding up to over 300 basic categories in all. The top five levels of the scheme are as follows:

==Idiophones (1)==
'''[[Idiophone]]s''' primarily produce their sounds by means of the actual body of the instrument vibrating, rather than a string, membrane, or column of air. In essence, this group includes all [[percussion instrument]]s apart from [[drums]], as well as some other instruments. In the Hornbostel–Sachs classification, idiophones are first categorized according to the method used to play the instrument. The result is four main categories: struck idiophones (11), plucked idiophones (12), friction idiophones (13), and blown idiophones (14). These groups are subsequently divided through various criteria. In many cases these sub-categories are split in singular specimens and sets of instruments. The latter category includes the [[xylophone]], the [[marimba]], the [[glockenspiel]], and the [[glass harmonica]].

([[List of idiophones by Hornbostel–Sachs number]])

===[[Struck idiophone]]s (11)===
These idiophones are set in vibration by being struck, for example [[cymbal]]s or [[xylophone]]s.

====[[Directly struck idiophone]]s (111)====
The player himself/herself executes the movement of striking; whether by mechanical intermediate devices, beaters, keyboards, or by pulling ropes, etc. It is definitive that the player can apply clear, exact, individual strokes, and that the instrument itself is equipped for this kind of percussion.
* 111.1 [[Concussion idiophone]]s or [[clapper (musical instrument)|clappers]] – Two or more complementary sonorous parts are struck against each other.
** 111.11 Concussion [[wikt:stick|sticks]] or [[stick clapper]]s ([[clapstick]]).
** 111.12 Concussion [[plaque (instrument)|plaques]] or [[plaque clapper]]s ([[paiban]]).
** 111.13 Concussion [[trough (physics)|troughs]] or [[watering trough|trough]] clappers ([[devil chase]]).
** 111.14 Concussion [[Bowl (vessel)|vessels]] or [[vessel clapper]]s ([[spoon (musical instrument)|spoons]]).
*** 111.141 [[Castanets]] – Natural and hollowed-out vessel clappers.
*** 111.142 [[Cymbals]] – Vessel clappers with manufactured rim.
* 111.2 [[Percussion idiophone]]s – The instrument is struck either with a non-sonorous object (hand, stick, striker) or against a non-sonorous object (human body, the ground).
** 111.21 [[Percussion stick]]s.
*** 111.211 Individual percussion sticks.
*** 111.212 Sets of percussion sticks in a range of different pitches combined into one instrument. – All [[xylophone]]s, as long  as their sounding components are not in two different planes.
** 111.22 [[Percussion plaque]]s.
*** 111.221 Individual percussion plaques.
*** 111.222 Sets of percussion plaques – Examples are the [[lithophone]] and also most [[metallophone]]s.
** 111.23 [[Percussion tube]]s.
*** 111.231 Individual percussion tubes.
*** 111.232 Sets of percussion tubes.
** 111.24 [[Percussion vessel]]s.
*** 111.241 [[Gong]]s – The vibration is strongest near the vertex.
**** 111.241.1 Individual gongs.
**** 111.241.2 Sets of gongs.
*** 111.242 [[Bell]]s – The vibration is weakest near the vertex.
**** 111.242.1 Individual bells.
***** 111.242.11 Resting bells whose opening faces upward (for example the [[singing bowl|standing bell]])
***** 111.242.12 Hanging bells suspended from the apex.
****** 111.242.121 Hanging bells without internal strikers.
****** 111.242.122 Hanging bells with internal strikers.
**** 111.242.2 Sets of bells or [[chimes]].
***** 111.242.21 Sets of resting bells whose opening faces upward.
***** 111.242.22 Sets of hanging bells suspended from the apex.
****** 111.242.221 Sets of hanging bells without internal strikers.
****** 111.242.222 Sets of hanging bells with internal strikers.

====Indirectly struck idiophones (112)====
The player himself/herself does not go through the movement of striking; percussion results indirectly through some other movement by the player.
* 112.1 Shaken Idiophones or [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]] – The player makes a shaking motion
** 112.11 Suspension rattles – Perforated idiophones are mounted together, and shaken to strike against each other.
*** 112.111 Strung rattles – Rattling objects are strung in rows on a cord.
*** 112.112 Stick rattles – Rattling objects are strung on a bar or ring.
** 112.12 Frame rattles – Rattling objects are attached to a carrier against which they strike ([[flexatone]]).
*** 112.121 Pendant rattles.
*** 112.122 Sliding rattles.
** 112.13 Vessel rattles – Rattling objects enclosed in a vessel strike against each other or against the walls of the vessel, or usually against both.
* 112.2 Scraped Idiophones – The player causes a scraping movement directly or indirectly; a non-sonorous object moves along the notched surface of a sonorous object, to be alternately lifted off the teeth and flicked against them; or an elastic sonorous object moves along the surface of a notched non-sonorous object to cause a series of impacts. This group must not be confused with that of friction idiophones.
** 112.21 Scraped sticks.
*** 112.211 Scraped sticks without resonator.
*** 112.212 Scraped sticks with resonator.
** 112.22 Scraped tubes.
** 112.23 Scraped vessels.
** 112.24 Scraped wheels – cog rattles or [[Ratchet (instrument)|Ratchet]]
* 112.3 Split idiophones – Instruments in the shape of two springy arms connected at one end and touching at the other: the arms are forced apart by a little stick, to jangle or vibrate on recoil.

===[[Plucked idiophone]]s (12)===
{{See|List of lamellophones}}

Plucked idiophones, or [[lamellaphone]]s, are idiophones set in vibration by being plucked; examples include the [[jaw harp]] or [[mbira]]. This group is sub-divided in the following two categories:

====In the form of a frame (121)====
The lamellae vibrate within a frame or hoop.
* 121.1 Clack idiophones or [[Cricri]] – The lamella is carved in the surface of a fruit shell, which serves as resonator.
* 121.2 Guimbardes  and [[Jaw harp]]s – The lamella is mounted in a rod- or plaque-shaped frame and depends on the player's mouth cavity for resonance.
** 121.21 Idioglot guimbardes – The lamella is cut through the frame of the instrument ([[kubing]]).
** 121.22 Heteroglot guimbardes – The lamella is attached to the frame (Western Jew's harp, [[kouxian]]).
*** 121.221 Individual heteroglot guimbardes.
*** 121.222 Sets of heteroglot guimbardes

====In the form of a comb (122)====
The lamellae are tied to a board or cut out from a board like the teeth of a comb.
* 122.1 With laced on lamellae.
** 122.11 Without resonator.
** 122.12 With resonator.
* 122.2 With cut-out lamellae – [[Musical box]]

===[[Friction idiophone]]s (13)===
Idiophones which are rubbed, for example the [[nail violin]], a bowed instrument with solid pieces of metal or wood rather than strings.

====Friction sticks (131)====
* 131.1 Individual friction sticks.
* 131.2 Sets of friction sticks.
** 131.21 Without direct friction.
** 131.22 With direct friction.

* 132.2 Sets of friction plaques.

====Friction vessels (133)====
* 133.1 Individual friction vessels (for example the [[singing bowl]])
* 133.2 Sets of friction vessels.

===[[Blown idiophone]]s (14)===
Blown idiophones are idiophones set in vibration by the movement of air, for example the [[Aeolsklavier]], an instrument consisting of several pieces of wood which vibrate when air is blown onto them by a set of [[bellows]]. The [[piano chanteur]] features plaques.

====Blown sticks (141)====
* 141.1 Individual blown sticks.
* 141.2 Sets of blown sticks.
** [[Aeolodion]]

====Shaken membranophones (212)====
Instruments which are shaken, the membrane being vibrated by objects inside the drum ([[rattle drum]]s).

===Plucked membranophones (22)===
Instruments with a string attached to the membrane, so that when the string is plucked, the membrane vibrates ([[plucked drum]]s).&lt;br&gt;
Some commentators believe that instruments in this class ought instead to be regarded as chordophones (see below).

===Friction membranophones (23)===
Instruments in which the membrane vibrates as a result of friction. These are drums which are rubbed, rather than being struck.

====Friction drums with stick (231)====
Instruments in which the membrane is vibrated from a stick that is rubbed or used to rub the membrane
* 231.1 Instruments in which the stick is inserted in a hole in the membrane
** 231.11 Instruments in which the stick can not be moved and is subject to rubbing, causing friction on the membrane
** 231.12 Instruments in which the stick is semi-movable, and can be used to rub the membrane
** 231.13 Instruments in which the stick is freely movable, and is used to rub the membrane
* 231.2 Instruments in which the stick is tied upright to the membrane

====Friction drum with cord (232)====
Instruments in which a cord, attached to the membrane, is rubbed.
* 232.1 Instruments in which the drum is held stationary while playing
** 232.11 Instruments which have only one usable membrane
** 232.12 Instruments which have two usable membranes
* 232.2 Instruments in which the drum is twirled by a cord, which rubs in a notch on the stick held by the player

====Hand friction drums (233)====
Instruments in which the membrane is rubbed by hand

===Singing membranes (kazoos) (24)===
This group includes [[kazoo]]s, instruments which do not produce sound of their own, but modify other sounds by way of a vibrating membrane.

====Free kazoos (241)====
Instruments in which the membrane is vibrated by an unbroken column of wind, without a chamber

====Tube or vessel-kazoos (242)====
Instruments in which the membrane is placed in a box, tube or other container

===Unclassified membranophones (25)===

==Chordophones (3)==
'''[[Chordophone]]s''' primarily produce their sounds by means of the vibration of a string or strings that are stretched between fixed points. This group includes all instruments generally called [[string instrument]]s in the west, as well as many (but not all) [[keyboard instrument]]s, such as [[piano]]s and [[harpsichord]]s. [[List of chordophones by Hornbostel–Sachs number]]

===Simple chordophones or [[zither]]s (31)===
Instruments which are in essence simply a string or strings and a string bearer. These instruments may have a resonator box, but removing it should not render the instrument unplayable, though it may result in quite a different sound being produced. They include the [[piano]] therefore, as well as other kinds of [[zither]]s such as the [[Koto (musical instrument)|koto]], and [[musical bow]]s.

====Bar or stick zithers (311)====
The string bearer is bar-shaped.
* 311.1 Musical bows – The string bearer is flexible (and curved).
** 311.11 Idiochord musical bows – The string is cut from the bark of the cane, remaining attached at each end.
*** 311.111 Mono-idiochord musical bows – Containing one string only
*** 311.112 Poly-idiochord musical bows or harp-bows – Containing several strings that pass over some type of bridge.
** 311.12 Heterochord musical bows – The string is of separate material from the bearer.
*** 311.121 Mono-heterochord musical bows – The bow has one heterochord string only.
**** 311.121.1 Without resonator.
***** 311.121.11 Without tuning noose.
***** 311.121.12 With tuning noose.
**** 311.121.2 With resonator.
***** 311.121.21 With independent resonator.
***** 311.121.22 With resonator attached.
****** 311.121.221 Without tuning noose.
****** 311.121.222 With tuning noose.
*** 311.122 Poly-heterochord musical bows – The bow has several heterochord strings.
**** 311.122.1 Without tuning noose.
**** 311.122.2 With tuning noose.
* 311.2 Stick zithers – With rigid string carrier
** 311.21 Musical bow/stick – The string carrier has one rigid and one flexible end.
** 311.22 True stick zithers – NB Round sticks which happen to be hollow by chance do not belong on this account to the tube zithers, but are round-bar zithers; however, instruments in which a tubular cavity is employed as a true resonator, like the modern Mexican harpa, are tube zithers.
*** 311.221 With one resonator gourd.
*** 311.222 With several resonator gourds.

====Tube zithers (312)====

===Unclassified chordophones (33)===

==Aerophones (4)==
'''[[Aerophone]]s''' primarily produce their sounds by means of vibrating air. The instrument itself does not vibrate, and there are no vibrating strings or membranes. [[List of aerophones by Hornbostel–Sachs number]]

===Free aerophones (41)===
Instruments in which the vibrating air is not contained within the instrument, for example sirens,&lt;!--Is this correct? Is [[Car horn#Signalling and vehicle horns]] what is meant?--&gt; or the [[Bullroarer (music)|bullroarer]].

====Displacement free aerophones (411)====
The air-stream meets a sharp edge, or a sharp edge is moved through the air. In either case, according to more recent views, a periodic displacement of air occurs to the alternate flanks of the edge. Examples are the swordblade or the whip.

====Interruptive free aerophones (412)====
The air-stream is interrupted periodically.
* 412.1 Idiophonic interruptive aerophones or reeds – The air-stream is directed against a lamella, setting it in periodic vibration to interrupt the stream intermittently. In this group also belong reeds with a 'cover,' i.e. a tube in which the air vibrates only in a secondary sense, not producing the sound but simply adding roundness and timbre to the sound made by the reed's vibration; generally recognizable by the absence of fingerholes.
** 412.11 Concussion reeds – Two lamellae make a gap which closes periodically during their vibration.
** 412.12 Percussion reeds – A single lamella strikes against a frame.
*** 412.121 Independent percussion reeds.
*** 412.122 Sets of percussion reeds. – Earlier organs
** 412.13 [[Free-reed instrument]]s feature a reed which vibrates within a closely fitting slot (there may be an attached pipe, but it should only vibrate in sympathy with the reed, and not have an effect on the pitch – instruments of this class can be distinguished from 422.3 by the lack of finger-holes).
*** 412.131 Individual free reeds.
*** 412.132 Sets of free reeds – [[Accordion]], [[harmonica]], and [[reed pipe]]s of the [[pipe organ]].
** 412.14 Band reed instruments – The air hits the sharp edge of a band under tension. The acoustics of this instrument have so far not been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mimo-db.eu/HornbostelAndSachs/237 412.14 Ribbon reeds]," ''Mimo-db.eu.''&lt;/ref&gt;
* 412.2 Non-idiophonic interruptive instruments. The interruptive agent is not a reed.
** 412.21 Rotating aerophones (interruptive agent rotates in its own plane and does not turn on its axis)- [[Siren disk]].
** 412.22 Whirling aerophones (interruptive agent turns on its axis) – [[Bullroarer]], [[whirly tube]].

====Plosive aerophones (413)====
The sound is caused by a single compression and release of air. Examples include the [[botija]], the [[gharha]], the [[ghatam]], and the [[udu]].

===Non-free aerophones (wind instruments proper) (42)===
The vibrating air is contained within the instrument. This group includes most of the instruments called [[wind instrument]]s in the west, such as the [[flute]] or [[French horn]], as well as many other kinds of instruments such as [[conch shell]]s.

====[[Edge-blown aerophones|Edge-blown aerophones or flutes]] (421)====

===Unclassified aerophones (43)===
{{Empty section|date=November 2018|section= }}

==[[Electrophone]]s (5)==
* 51. Instruments having electric action (e.g. pipe organ with electrically controlled solenoid air valves);
* 52. Instruments having electrical amplification, such as the Neo-Bechstein piano of 1931, which had 18 microphones built into it;
* 53. ''Radioelectric instruments'': instruments in which sound is produced by electrical means.

The fifth top-level group, the '''[[electrophone]]s''' category, was added by Sachs in 1940, to describe instruments involving electricity. Sachs broke down his 5th category into 3 subcategories: 51=electrically actuated acoustic instruments; 52=electrically amplified acoustic instruments; 53= instruments which make sound primarily by way of electrically driven oscillators, such as [[theremin]]s or [[synthesizer]]s, which he called radioelectric instruments. [[Francis William Galpin]] provided such a group in his own classification system, which is closer to Mahillon than Sachs–Hornbostel. For example, in Galpin's 1937 book ''A Textbook of European Musical Instruments,'' he lists electrophones with three second-level divisions for sound generation ("by oscillation," "electro-magnetic," and "electro-static"), as well as third-level and fourth-level categories based on the control method. Sachs himself proposed subcategories 51, 52, and 53, on pages 447–467 of his 1940 book ''The History of Musical Instruments.'' However, the original 1914 version of the system did not acknowledge the existence of his 5th category.

Present-day ethnomusicologists, such as Margaret Kartomi (page 173) and Ellingson (PhD dissertation, 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;544), suggest that, in keeping with the spirit of the original Hornbostel–Sachs classification scheme, of categorization by what first produces the initial sound in the instrument, that only subcategory 53 should remain in the electrophones category. Thus it has been more recently proposed that, for example, the pipe organ (even if it uses electric key action to control solenoid valves) remain in the aerophones category, and that the electric guitar remain in the chordophones category, etc..

==Application of the system==
Beyond the top three groups are several further levels of classification, so that the [[xylophone]], for example, is in the group labeled 111.212 (periods are usually added after every third digit to make long numbers easier to read). A long classification number does not necessarily indicate the instrument is a complicated one. The [[Bugle (instrument)|valveless bugle]] for instance, has the classification number 423.121.22, even though it is generally regarded as a relatively simple instrument (it is basically a bent conical tube which you blow down like a [[trumpet]], but it does not have valves or finger-holes). The numbers in the bugle's classification indicate the following:
* '''4''' – an aerophone
* '''42''' – the vibrating air is enclosed within the instrument
* '''423''' – the player's lips cause the air to vibrate directly (as opposed to an instrument with a reed like a [[clarinet]], or an edge-blown instrument, like a [[flute]])
* '''423.1''' – the player's lips are the only means of changing the instrument's pitch (that is, there are no valves as on a trumpet)
* '''423.12''' – the instrument is tubular, rather than being a [[conch]]-type instrument
* '''423.121''' – the player blows into the end of the tube, as opposed to the side of the tube
* '''423.121.2''' – the tube is bent or folded, as opposed to straight
* '''423.121.22''' – the instrument has a [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]]

423.121.22 does not uniquely identify the bugle, but rather identifies the bugle as a certain kind of instrument which has much in common with other instruments in the same class. Another instrument classified as 423.121.22 is the bronze [[lur]], an instrument dating back to the [[Bronze Age]].

==Suffixes and composite instruments==
After the number described above, a number of [[suffix]]es may be appended. An '''8''' indicates that the instrument has a keyboard attached, while a '''9''' indicates the instrument is mechanically driven. In addition to these, there are a number of suffixes unique to each of the top-level groups indicating details not considered crucial to the fundamental nature of the instrument. In the membranophone class, for instance, suffixes can indicate whether the skin of a drum is glued, nailed or tied to its body; in the chordophone class, suffixes can indicate whether the strings are plucked with fingers or plectrum, or played with a bow.

There are ways to classify instruments with this system even if they have elements from more than one group. Such instruments may have particularly long classification numbers with colons and hyphens used as well as numbers. Hornbostel and Sachs themselves cite the case of various [[bagpipe]]s where some of the pipes are single reed (like a clarinet) and others are double reed (like the [[oboe]]). A number of similar composite instruments exist.

'''''Humanitas''''' is a [[Latin]] noun meaning human nature, civilization, and kindness.

==Classical origins of term==
The Latin word ''humanitas'' corresponded to the Greek concepts of ''[[Philanthropy#Classical Philanthropy|philanthrôpía]]'' (loving what makes us human) and ''[[paideia]]'' (education) which were amalgamated with a [[Virtue#Roman virtues|series of qualities]] that made up the traditional unwritten Roman code of conduct (''[[mos maiorum]]'').&lt;ref&gt;The opening chapter of Cicero's [[Tusculan Disputations]] enumerates some of them: ''Quae enim tanta gravitas, quae tanta constantia, magnitudo animi, probitas, fides, quae tam excellens in omni genere virtus in ullis fuit, ut sit cum maioribus nostris comparanda?'' "For what weight of character, what firmness, magnanimity, probity, good faith, what surpassing virtue of any type, has been found in any people to such a degree as to make them the equals of our ancestors?" (''Tusculanae Disputationes'' 1.2.). Of the Roman political virtues, Richard Bauman judges clemency as the most important. See Richard A. Bauman, ''Human Rights in Ancient Rome'' (London: Routledge, 2000), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] (106–43 BC) used ''humanitas'' in describing the formation of an ideal speaker ([[orator]]) who he believed should be [[Education|educated]] to possess a collection of virtues of character suitable both for an active life of public service and a decent and fulfilling private life; these would include a fund of learning acquired from the study of ''bonae litterae'' ("good letters", i.e., classical literature, especially poetry), which would also be a source of continuing cultivation and pleasure in leisure and retirement, youth and old age, and good and bad fortune.&lt;ref&gt;The word occurs also in other Latin writers of the Classical period. For example, ''cultus atque humanitas'' ("culture and humanity"), meaning "civilization", appears in the [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=CaeComm.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=1&amp;division=div2  opening sentences] of [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[Gallic Wars]] (1. 1. 3), where Caesar calls the tribe of the Belgae the bravest, because farthest away from Romanized Southern France ([[Provence]]). It also occurs five times in the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'', for centuries erroneously attributed to Cicero but which in fact predates him. However, the concept was most fully elaborated by Cicero, who uses the word 299 times, accounting for about half of the 463 occurrences in all the other Classical Latin writers together. See [http://www.tulliana.eu/documenti/Oniga_Humanitas.pdf Renato Oniga, "Humanitas"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in ''Tulliana'' (2009) II. On the distinctly Roman cast of Cicero's adaptation of the concept of ''humanitas'' from the Greek ''[[paidea]]'', Oniga cites a 1973 study by the German scholar Wolfgang Schadewaldt:&lt;blockquote&gt;...''l’essenza della'' humanitas ''romana sta propriamente nell’essere l’altra faccia di un insieme ordinato di valori molto precisi e severi, che facevano parte del codice di comportamento del cittadino romano fin dalle origini, e sono pressoché intraducibili in greco: la ''pietas ''(che è qualcosa di diverso dalla'' eusébeia''), ''mores'' (che non coincidono esattamente con l''’ethos), ''e poi la'' dignitas'', la ''gravitas'', l’''integritas, ''e così via. L’idea di humanitas riassumeva in sé tuttiquesti valori . . . ma nello stesso tempo li sfumava, li rendeva meno rigidi e più universali.''&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; ...the essence of Roman ''humanitas'' is that it constitutes one of the aspects of an orderly complex of very distinct and severe values that had been part of the code of conduct of a Roman citizen from the outset and are virtually untranslatable in Greek: ''pietas'' (which is different from ''[[Eusebeia#Classical Greek usage|eusébeia]]''), ''mores'' (which do not coincide exactly with ''[[ethos]]''), and ''dignitas'', ''gravitas'', ''integritas'', and so on. The idea of ''humanitas'' subsumed all these values ... simultaneously blurring their outlines, rendering them less rigid and more universal.&lt;/blockquote&gt; See Wolfgang Schadewaldt, “Humanitas Romana" (in Hildegard Temporini and Wolfgang Haase, editors, ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' I.4, 1973, p. 47). For further discussion of Schadewaldt's essay, see also Bauman's ''Human Rights in Ancient Rome'', pp. 21–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Insofar as ''humanitas'' corresponded to ''philanthrôpía'' and ''paideia'', it was particularly applicable to guiding the proper exercise of power over others. Hence Cicero's advice to his brother that "if fate had given you authority over Africans or Spaniards or Gauls, wild and barbarous nations, you would still owe it to your ''humanitas'' to be concerned about their comforts, their needs, and their safety."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Greg Woolf]], ''Becoming Roman: The Origins of Provincial Civilization in Gaul'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Echoing Cicero over a century later, [[Pliny the Younger]] (61-112 A.D.) defined ''humanitas'' as the capacity to win the affections of lesser folk without impinging on greater (Ep. IX, 5).&lt;ref&gt;See Zvi Yavetz, ''Plebs and Princeps'' (Transaction Publishers, 1988),  p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival in Early Italian Renaissance==
The concept was of great importance during the re-discovery of [[Classical Antiquity]] during the age of the [[Renaissance]] by the Italian ''[[Renaissance Humanism|umanisti]]'', beginning with the illustrious Italian poet [[Petrarch]], who revived Cicero's injunction to cultivate the [[humanities]], understood during the Renaissance as grammar, rhetoric, poetry, history, and moral philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Early Italian humanism, which in many respects continued the grammatical and rhetorical traditions of the [[Middle Ages]], not merely provided the old [[Trivium (education)|Trivium]] with a new and more ambitious name (''Studia humanitatis''), but also increased its actual scope, content, and significance in the curriculum of the schools and universities and in its own extensive literary production. The ''studia humanitatis'' excluded logic, but they added to the traditional grammar and rhetoric not only history, Greek, and moral philosophy, but also made poetry, once a sequel of grammar and rhetoric, the most important member of the whole group. —[[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], ''Renaissance Thought II: Papers on Humanism and the Arts'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965), p. 178.&lt;/blockquote&gt; See also Kristeller's "Humanism and Scholasticism In the Italian Renaissance", ''Byzantion 17'' (1944–45), pp. 346–74. Reprinted in ''Renaissance Thought'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks), 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1333, in [[Liège]], [[Belgium]], Petrarch had found and copied out in his own hand a manuscript of Cicero's speech, ''[[Pro Archia Poeta|Pro Archia]]'', which contained a famous passage in defense of poetry and ''litterae'' (letters): &lt;blockquote&gt;''Haec studia adolescentiam alunt, senectutem oblectant, secundas res ornant, adversis perfugium ac solacium praebent, delectant domi, non impediunt foris, pernoctant nobiscum, peregrinantur, rusticantur.'' (Translation: "These studies sustain youth and entertain old age, they enhance prosperity, and offer a refuge and solace in adversity; they delight us when we are at home without hindering us in the wider world, and are with us at night, when we travel and when we visit the countryside").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1695391 ''Pro Archia'' paragraph 16.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Petrarch liked this quotation and referred to it often, and where Cicero used the phrase "''litterarum lumen''", "the light of literature", Petrarch in the margin wrote ''lumen litterarum'' alongside and drew a sketch of a lamp or candle. The Liège manuscript is lost and so is Petrarch's copy, but Petrarch's copy "can be shown to be behind all but one of the later manuscripts" and preserve Petrarch's marginal annotations.&lt;ref&gt;MIchael D. Reeve writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If it is true that Italian humanists had no expression closer to ‘classical scholarship’ than ''studia humanitatis'', the ''Pro Archia'' provided classical scholarship in the Renaissance with its charter of foundation. In Petrarch’s attention to ''Pro Archia'' eight elements can be distinguished:
#	He discovered the speech.
#	He liked it because it extolled poetry
#	He used it in works of his own
#	He marked details in it, sometimes because related things had struck him elsewhere in his reading of ancient literature
#	He adjusted its text
#	He spoke of his discovery in correspondence that he put in wider circulation
#	He put the speech itself into wide circulation
#	Such was his prestige both as a writer and as a collector that after his death ''Pro Archia'' became one of many texts in his library sought out for copying.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
See Michael D. Reeve, "Classical Scholarship" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Renaissance Humanism'', Jill Kraye, editor (Cambridge, 1996), pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrarch, in many respects a Medieval man, regretted that Cicero had not been a Christian and believed that he certainly would have been one had he not died before the birth of Jesus. To Petrarch and the Renaissance ''umanisti'' who immediately followed him, Cicero's ''humanitas'' was not seen as in conflict with Christianity or a Christian education. In this they followed the fifth century Church fathers such as  Jerome and Augustine, who taught that Greek and Roman learning and literature were gifts of God and models of excellence, provided, of course, they were filtered and purified in order to serve Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Ernst Robert Curtius recounts that "St. Jerome furnished the Middle Ages with an oft repeated argument for utilizing antique learning in the service of Christianity: In Deuteronomy 21 :12: If a Hebrew desires to marry  a heathen slave, he shall cut her hair and her nails. In like manner the Chritian who loves secular learning shall purify it from all errors. Then it is worthy to serve God." St. Augustine "in his allegorical exposition of Exodus 3 : 22  and 12 : 35: When they went out of Egypt the Israelites took gold and silver vessels with them, thus the Christian must rid pagan learning of what is superfluous and pernicious, that he may place it in the service of truth." See [[Ernst Robert Curtius]], ''European Literature in the Latin Middle Ages'' (Princeton, N.J.: Bollingen Series / Princeton University Press, 1973 [1953]), p. 40 and passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humanitas during the French Enlightenment==
According to historian [[Peter Gay]], the eighteenth-century French [[philosophes]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] found Cicero's eclectic, [[Stoicism|Stoic]]-tinged paganism congenial:&lt;blockquote&gt;The ideal of ''humanitas'' was first brought to Rome by the philosophic circle around Scipio and further developed by Cicero. For Cicero, ''humanitas'' was a style of thought, not a formal doctrine. It asserted man’s importance as a cultivated being, in control of his moral universe. The man who practiced ''humanitas'' was confident of his worth, courteous to others, decent in his social conduct, and active in his political role. He was a man, moreover, who faced life with courageous skepticism: he knows that the consolations of popular religion are for more credulous beings than himself, that life is uncertain, and that sturdy pessimism is superior to self-deceptive optimism. Man becomes man as he refines himself; he even becomes godlike: “''Deus est mortali iuvare mortalem'',” wrote Pliny, translating a Greek Stoic, “To help man is man’s true God.” Finally, the man who practiced ''humanitas'' cultivated his aesthetic sensibilities as he listened to his reason: "''Cum musis,''” wrote Cicero, “''id est, cum humanitate et doctrina habere commercium''".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay's citation of the phrase, ''Cum musis'', etc., refers to an anecdote in the ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'', in which Cicero recounts how during a visit to Syracuse, in Sicily, he had chanced to discover the tomb of [[Archimedes]], at that time unknown to the inhabitants of the city, but which he, Cicero, recognized from its description in a line of poetry he had memorized; and he contrasted the enduring fame of Archimedes, the mathematician, to the obloquy of the notorious Sicilian tyrant  [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius the Elder]], buried nearby: “Who is there who has had anything at all to do with the Muses, that is, with humanity and learning, who would not prefer to be this mathematician rather than that tyrant? If we look into their manner of life and employment, the mind of the one was nourished by seeking out and pondering theories, accompanied by the delight in his cleverness, which is the sweetest sustenance of souls, that of the other in murder and wrongdoing, accompanied by fear both day and night” (TD 5.64–5). This anecdote is one of the sources for the humanist commonplace that poetry is a more lasting monument than stone. See Mary Jaeger, ”Cicero and Archimedes Tomb", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 92, (2002), pp. 51–52. The incident is recalled by [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;''Call Archimedes from his buried tomb
''Upon the plain of vanished Syracuse,
''And feelingly the Sage shall make report
''How insecure, how baseless in itself,
''Is the Philosophy, whose sway depends
''On mere material instruments;—how weak
''Those arts, and high inventions, if unpropped
''By virtue.—He, sighing with pensive grief,
''Amid his calm abstractions, would admit
''That not the slender privilege is theirs
''To save themselves from blank forgetfulness!'' —[http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/Cicero.html William Wordsworth (1770-1850), ''The Excursion'' (Book Eighth: "The Parsonage", lines 220-230)]&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Virtue, Cicero insisted, is nothing but nature perfected and developed to its highest point, and there is therefore a resemblance between man and God: "''Est autem virtus nihil aliud quam in se perfecta et ad summum perducta natura; est igitur homini cum deo similitudio''".&lt;ref&gt;See Cicero, ''[[De Legibus]]'', [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/leg1.shtml Book 1: 25].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cicero’s ''humanitas'' . . . reappeared in the first century in [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]’s claim – made in the midst of a lament over Roman bestiality – that man is a sacred thing to man: “''homo res sacra homini''”; and reappeared once more in the eighteenth century in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]’s call for human autonomy and in [[Voltaire]]’s stern injunction: “Remember your dignity as a man.” In the beginning of his ''[[Meditations]]'', the Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] elaborated a veritable catalog of qualities which, all together, made up the virtues which Cicero had called ''humanitas'' and which the ''philosophes'' hoped they possessed in good measure: modesty, self-control, manliness, beneficence, practicality, generosity, rationality, tolerance, and obedience to the dictates of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''The Enlightenment: The Rise of Modern Paganism'' (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, [1966] 1995), pp. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Revival in 18th- and 19th-century Germany==
During the [[Aufklärung]] (or German version of the eighteenth-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), the term "''Humanität''" was used to designate the intellectual, physical, and moral formation of "a better [[human being]]" (or [[Humanism]]). It was used, for example, by theologian [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] in his ''Briefe zur Beförderung der Humanität'' (''Letters for the Advancement of Humanity''), 1792, and by [[Friedrich Schiller]], among others.&lt;blockquote&gt;Herder's ''Humanität'' is a broad concept he defines variously as the gradual fulfillment of best human potential, the achievement of reason and fairness in all classes and in all affairs of men, and the joint product of the creative actions of legislators, poets, artists, philosophers, inventors, and educators through the ages.&lt;ref&gt;T. J. Reed, ''Light in Germany: Scenes from an Unknown Enlightenment'' (University of Chicago, 2015), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Herder is considered the originator of ethnic nationalism, he was no chauvinist. He maintained that each person loves his own nation, family, language, and customs not because they are better than other peoples' but because they were his. Love for one's own individuality ought to lead to respect for that of others. For Herder, the image of God was imprinted in each human being, along with an internal impulse for self-improvement and growth. Historian William McNeil writes that Herder boldly proclaimed that:&lt;blockquote&gt;each age and every people embody ideals and capacities peculiar to themselves, thus allowing a fuller and more complete expression of the multiform potentialities of humankind than could otherwise occur. Herder expressly denied that one people or civilization was better than another. They were just different, in the same way that the German language was different from the French.&lt;ref&gt;William Hardy McNiell, "Discrepancies among the social sciences", ''Conspectus of History'' 1: 7 (1981): 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Humanitas as benevolence==
In Roman humanism, benevolence (''benevolentia'') was considered a feature of ''Humanitas''. This notion is particularly underscored in the works of Cicero and Seneca.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cadenzas: Philosophical Notes for Postmodernism|last=Poma|first=Andrea|publisher=Springer|year=2017|isbn=9783319528113|location=Berlin|pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, benevolence drives the idea of humaneness and is understood as a feeling either of love or tenderness so that it makes "someone willing to participate, at the level of feeling, in whatever is human."&lt;ref&gt;Poma, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Such participation entails a willingness to engage both in human suffering and joy. This was echoed in the Kantian position on love, where the thinker cited the so-called rational benevolence driven by natural sympathetic joy and pity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kant on Love|last=Rinne|first=Pärttyli|publisher=Walter de Gryuter|year=2018|isbn=9783110543858|location=Berlin|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other thinkers have also discussed benevolence in modern humanism. Max Scheler, for example, used it as an important element in his discourse of sympathy. In one of his works, he linked benevolence and the concept of "fellow-feeling," which allows self-love, self-centred choice, solipsism and egoism" to finally be wholly overcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Nature of Sympathy|last=Scheler|first=Max|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2008|isbn=9781412806879|location=New Brunswick|pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scheler specifically equated benevolence with humanitarianism, explaining that these concepts - along with fellow-feeling - embrace all men, "simply because they are men."&lt;ref&gt;Scheler, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Humanitas'' as [[Altruism|benevolence]], is also a cornerstone of the credo of [[Freemasonry]] and constituted one of the bases for its position that nationality and religion do not matter, only universal humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cosmopolitan Outsiders: Imperial Inclusion, National Exclusion, and the Pan-European Idea, 1900-1930|last=Sorrels|first=Katherine|publisher=Springer|year=2016|isbn=9781349720620|location=Berlin|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some orders of Freemasonry are called "Humanitas".

'''Investor-state dispute settlement''' ('''ISDS''') or '''investment court system''' ('''ICS''') is a system through which investors can sue countries for alleged discriminatory practices. ISDS is an instrument of [[public international law]] and provisions are contained in a number of [[Bilateral Investment Treaty|bilateral investment treaties]], in certain international [[trade treaty|trade treaties]], such as [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] (chapter 11), and the proposed [[Trans-Pacific Partnership|TPP]] (chapter 9) and [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement|CETA]] (sections 3 and 4) agreements. ISDS is also found in [[international investment agreement]]s, such as the [[Energy Charter Treaty]]. If an investor from one country (the "home state") invests in another country (the "host state"), both of which have agreed to ISDS, and the host state violates the rights granted to the investor under the treaty, then that investor may bring the matter before an [[arbitral tribunal]].

While ISDS is often associated with [[international arbitration]] under the rules of ICSID (the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] of the [[World Bank]]), it often takes place under the auspices of international arbitral tribunals governed by different rules or institutions, such as the [[London Court of International Arbitration]], the [[International Chamber of Commerce]], the [[Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre]] or the [[UNCITRAL]] Arbitration Rules.

== Foreign investment protection ==
=== Historical development ===
Under [[customary international law]] a state can vindicate injury caused to its nation by the host state by exercising [[diplomatic protection]], which may include [[retorsion]] and/or [[reprisals]]. In addition to diplomatic protection and to avoid having to resort to coercive means, states can and do establish ad hoc commissions and [[arbitral tribunal]]s to adjudicate claims involving treatment of foreign nationals and their property by the Host State ("state-state-dispute-settlement", SSDS). Notable examples of this practice are the [[Jay Treaty]] commissions, the [[Iran–United States Claims Tribunal]] and the [[American-Mexican Claims Commission]].&lt;ref name="NewcombeParadell" /&gt; However, these treaties were limited to the treatment of foreign investors during a past period of time, whereas modern ISDS allows investors to make claims against states in general and on a prospective basis.

=== Modern practice ===
Currently, the legal protection of [[Foreign Direct Investment]] under [[public international law]] is guaranteed by a network of more than 2750 [[Bilateral Investment Treaty|bilateral investment treaties]] (BITs), Multilateral Investment Treaties, most notably the [[Energy Charter Treaty]] and number of Free Trade Agreements such as [[NAFTA]] containing a chapter on investment protection. Most of these treaties were signed by states in the late 1980s and early 1990s, before the current explosion of investor claims under the treaties began in the late 1990s.

The majority of these legal instruments provides foreign investors with a substantive legal protection (including the right to "fair and equitable treatment", "full protection and security", "free transfer of means" and the right not to be directly or indirectly expropriated without full compensation) and access to ISDS for redress against Host States for breaches of such protection. Some of these standards are framed in vague terms, given extensive discretion to arbitrators in their interpretation and application. The overall number of known cases reached over 500 in 2012. Of these, 244 were concluded, of which approximately 42% were decided in favour of the Host State and approximately 31% in favour of the investor. Approximately 27% of the cases were settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/webdiaepcb2013d3_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Recent Developments in Investor-State Disputes|publisher=Unctad.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:NAFTA logo.png|right|150px|thumb|Chapter 11 of [[NAFTA]] includes an Investor-State provision.]]

Notably, only foreign investors can sue states under investment treaties, because states are the parties to the treaty, and only states can be held liable to pay damages for breach of the treaty. States have no corresponding right to bring an original claim against a foreign investor under such treaties, again because investors are not parties to the treaty and therefore cannot be in breach of it. Thus, a decision in favour of the State means that the state has not been ordered to pay compensation, not that it has received any compensation from the investor, although costs can be awarded against the investor. A state cannot "win" in ISDS in the manner of a foreign investor - a state which wishes to sue a foreign investor does so through its own domestic courts, without the need for a treaty.

ISDS cannot overturn local laws (unlike the [[World Trade Organization]]) which violate trade agreements,&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://piie.com/publications/piie-briefings/assessing-trans-pacific-partnership-volume-1-market-access-and-sectoral|title=Assessing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Volume 1: Market Access and Sectoral Issues {{!}} PIIE|website=piie.com|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=f30e1893-08fb-4c8e-93bd-eac8442faf5e|title=Investor-state dispute settlement: the importance of an informed, fact-based debate|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=International Bar Association|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but can grant monetary damages to investors adversely affected by such laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/10/obscure-legal-system-lets-corportations-sue-states-ttip-icsid|title=The obscure legal system that lets corporations sue countries|date=10 June 2015|publisher=The Guardian|author=Claire Provost and Matt Kennard|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]], ISDS requires specific treaty violations, and does not allow corporations to sue solely over "lost profits".&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/blog/2015/march/isds-important-questions-and-answers|title=ISDS: Important Questions and Answers {{!}} United States Trade Representative|website=ustr.gov|access-date=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such violations may be difficult to foresee, and the threat of exorbitant fines may cause a [[chilling effect]] which halts regulation or legislation in the public interest (e.g. human health and environmental protection).&lt;ref name="SCint"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/933590566|title=Shadow courts : the tribunals that rule global trade|last=Sweetland,|first=Edwards, Haley|publisher=Colombia Global Reports|year=2016|isbn=9780997126402|location=|pages=Chapter: Introduction|oclc=933590566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also state that treaties are written so that any legislation causing lost profits is per definition a treaty violation, rendering the argument null that only treaty violations are subject to ISDS.&lt;ref name="SCint"/&gt;

==== NAFTA Chapter 11 ====
{{main|North American Free Trade Agreement}}
A notable example of ISDS, which has been in existence for two decades now, is Chapter 11 of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). NAFTA Chapter 11 allows investors of one NAFTA party (Canada, United States or Mexico) to bring claims directly against the government of another NAFTA party before an international [[arbitral tribunal]]. Because NAFTA Article 1121 waives the local remedies rule, investors are not required to exhaust local remedies before filing Chapter 11 claims. While this fact has been amply criticized in public, proponents of ISDS tend to point out that speedy dispute resolution through ISDS is critical in modern economic environments and would be defeated by adding several instances of local remedies. On the other hand, there is no other situation in international law where a private party can sue a state without showing that the state's domestic courts are not independent or reliable. The removal of the customary duty to exhaust local remedies, where they are reasonably available, is claimed to be a factor in the explosion of investment treaty claims since the late 1990s, although a more obvious explanation is the explosion in the number of bilateral free trade agreements since the breakdown of the multilateral WTO Doha round in the mid 2000s.

Investors may initiate an arbitration against the NAFTA Party under the Arbitration Rules of the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]] ("UNCITRAL Rules") or under the Rules of the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] ("ICSID Rules"). NAFTA Chapter 11 was the first instance of an ISDS provision receiving widespread public attention, especially in the United States in the wake of the [[Methanex]] case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/s/l/c5818.htm|title=Methanex Corp. v. United States of America|publisher=State.gov|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TTIP ===
Resistance from the EU side to the US proposal to include an ISDS clause in the draft [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]] treaty was such as to cause this element to be abandoned in September 2015. In its place, the [[European Commission]] proposed an investment court system (ICS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/130297|title=EU proposes new trade court with US|last=Nielsen|first=Nikolaj|date=16 September 2015|website=EUobserver|access-date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/eu-unit/Global/eu-unit/reports-briefings/2016/2016_02_11_Greenpeace%20Position%20Paper%20ICS_Final.pdf|title=From ISDS to ICS: A Leopard Can't Change Its Spots|date=11 February 2016|publisher=Greenpeace Position Paper|page=1|access-date=23 February 2016|author=Greenpeace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5651_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Not long afterwards, ICS was declared illegal by the German Association of Magistrates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/132142|title=TTIP investor court illegal, say German judges|last=Nielsen|first=Nikolaj|date=4 February 2016|website=EUobserver|access-date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the Commission dismissed the magistrates' judgement as based on a misunderstanding.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/132295|title=EU defends TTIP investor court after German backlash|last=Nielsen|first=Nikolaj|date=17 February 2016|website=EUobserver|access-date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For its part, the United States wants ISDS reinstated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Proponents of ISDS argue that governments retain their regulatory ability, if the agreements in question specify that regulations protecting health, the environment, labour rights and human rights are allowed. The [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]] challenges the notion that ISDS challenges "the sovereign ability of governments impose any measure they wish to protect labor rights, the environment, or other issues of public welfare".&lt;ref name=":152"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/blog/2015/march/isds-important-questions-and-answers|title=ISDS: Important Questions and Answers {{!}} United States Trade Representative|website=ustr.gov|access-date=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Bar Association|International Bar Association (IBA)]] mirrors these sentiments, noting that "while investment treaties limit states’ ability to inflict arbitrary or discriminatory treatment, they do not limit (and, in fact, expressly safeguard) a state’s sovereign right to regulate in the public interest in a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory manner."&lt;ref name=":272"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=f30e1893-08fb-4c8e-93bd-eac8442faf5e|title=Investor-state dispute settlement: the importance of an informed, fact-based debate|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=International Bar Association|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[White House Office|White House]] notes that investment protections are a component of more than 3,000 trade agreements, the vast majority of which have some form of neutral arbitration.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/02/26/investor-state-dispute-settlement-isds-questions-and-answers|title=Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) Questions and Answers|date=26 February 2015|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is party to at least 50 such agreements, has only faced 13 ISDS cases and never lost an ISDS case.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

The [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] claims that ISDS provisions are necessary, as they boost investment: "empirical evidence has shown that treaties including these provisions have a positive effect on foreign direct investment (FDI) flows between signatory countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://piie.com/blogs/trade-investment-policy-watch/what-do-data-say-about-relationship-between-investor-state|title=What Do the Data Say about the Relationship between Investor-State Dispute Settlement Provisions and FDI? {{!}} PIIE|website=piie.com|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; PIIE challenges the claim that ISDS "arbitrators lack integrity", noting that arbitrators take an oath of impartiality and both sides of a case choose arbitrators.&lt;ref name=":232"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://piie.com/publications/piie-briefings/assessing-trans-pacific-partnership-volume-1-market-access-and-sectoral|title=Assessing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Volume 1: Market Access and Sectoral Issues {{!}} PIIE|website=piie.com|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a February 2016 op-ed against the TPP, Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]] used the example of a French company suing Egypt because Egypt raised its minimum wage as an argument against the ISDS provisions of the TPP.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Washington Post editorial board has however challenged this characterization of the case, noting that "[[Veolia]] of France, a waste management company, invoked ISDS to enforce a contract with the government of [[Alexandria|Alexandria, Egypt]], that it says required compensation if costs increased; the company maintains that the wage increases triggered this provision. Incidentally, Veolia was working with Alexandria on a [[World Bank]]-supported project to reduce greenhouse gases, not some corporate plot to exploit the people. The case — which would result, at most, in a monetary award to Veolia, not the overthrow of the minimum wage — remains in litigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dont-buy-the-trade-deal-alarmism/2015/03/11/41575fee-c1d5-11e4-9271-610273846239_story.html|title=Don’t buy the trade deal alarmism|last=Board|first=Editorial|date=11 March 2015|access-date=1 August 2016|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Bar Association|International Bar Association (IBA)]], states have won a higher percentage of ISDS cases than investors, and that around one-third of all cases end in settlement.&lt;ref name=":273"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=f30e1893-08fb-4c8e-93bd-eac8442faf5e|title=Investor-state dispute settlement: the importance of an informed, fact-based debate|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=International Bar Association|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claimant investors, when successful, recover on average less than half of what the amounts claimed.&lt;ref name=":273" /&gt; IBA notes that "only 8 per cent of ISDS proceedings are commenced by very large multinational corporations."&lt;ref name=":273" /&gt; IBA challenges the notion that ISDS is biased against developing countries, noting that there is "no correlation between the success rates of claims against states and their income levels or development status."&lt;ref name=":273" /&gt; IBA notes that ISDS is necessary even in countries with sophisticated domestic legal systems because those domestic courts rule according to domestic laws, not international law.&lt;ref name=":273" /&gt; IBA notes that "increasingly, awards require the losing party to pay arbitration costs and legal fees to the winning party", which deters investors from initiating unmeritorious cases.&lt;ref name=":273" /&gt;

A 2017 study found that the success rates of investors in investor-state disputes has sharply fallen over time because most legal challenges today seek compensation for regulation implemented by democracies, not expropriation by non-democracies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pelc|first=Krzysztof J.|date=31 May 2017|title=What Explains the Low Success Rate of Investor-State Disputes?|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/what-explains-the-low-success-rate-of-investorstate-disputes/7AE6CEA67B5A0FADAE3B11703C4A1442|journal=International Organization|pages=1–25|doi=10.1017/S0020818317000212|issn=0020-8183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the study argues that the likely goal of investors is not to obtain compensation through ISDS, but to impose costs on governments contemplating regulations and therefore deter the regulatory ambitions of governments.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Transparency ===
Opponents of ISDS argue that arbitrations are sometimes carried out in secret by trade lawyers who do not enjoy the typical safeguards of judicial independence and procedural fairness, who earn income only if a case is brought and proceeds, and who are not accountable to the public or required to take into account broader constitutional and international law human rights norms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://justinvestment.org/2011/05/oecd-document-discusses-investor-state-dispute-settlement/ Van Harten, Gus. "OECD Document Discusses Investor State Dispute Settlement".] Accessed: 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] agrees "that secrecy has gone too far" in many ISDS cases, but notes that agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership did ensure greater transparency in ISDS.&lt;ref name=":232" /&gt; Proponents of ISDS point out that confidentiality is a standard feature of all [[arbitration]] and one that enables a constructive, de-politicized and fact-oriented atmosphere of dispute resolution. On the other hand, such traditional confidentiality is limited to disputes that affect the parties in question and not the broader public. Also, most ICSID awards, although confidential, are de facto published by consent of the parties. However, many awards under other arbitration rules are not public and, in the case of investor-arbitration at the International Chamber of Commerce, there is a requirement for blanket confidentiality for all aspects of a case.

It is further pointed out that judges are not elected in most countries outside the US, so that "public accountability of judges" may not be considered a standard of [[public international law]]. In any event, they say, the qualification of ISDS arbitrators matches or exceeds the qualification of most court judges.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In response, critics make the point that any judge, whether domestic or international, who is part of a legal system not shown to be systematically biased or unreliable, has a greater claim to independence than an arbitrator because they are insulated from conflicts of interest that arise when arbitrators work on the side as lawyers, and is assigned cases in an objective manner rather than by the discretion of a disputing party or an executive official. Arbitrators are appointed by both parties at dispute, so such conflicts of interest may arise on both sides.

While ISDS has traditionally been confidential as any other [[arbitration]], the general trend in the last decade has been to allow for more openness and transparency. On the other hand, there is still widespread confidentiality in the system.

Under Art. 29 of the U.S. Model-BIT of 2004, all documents pertaining to ISDS have to be made public and [[amicus curiae]] briefs are allowed. However, no investment treaty allows other parties who have an interest in the dispute, other than the claimant investor and respondent government, to obtain [[standing (law)|standing]] in the adjudicative process.

Under the [[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership]], the tribunals shall, subject to the consent of the disputing parties, conduct hearings open to the public. The tribunal will make available to the public documents relating to the dispute such as the notice of intent, the notice of arbitration, pleadings, memorials, minutes or transcripts of the hearings of the tribunal, where available; orders, awards and decisions of the tribunal. In addition, third parties can and increasingly do participate in investor-state arbitration by submitting ''[[amicus curiae]]'' petitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/StaticFiles/basicdoc/partF-chap04.htm#r37 |title=ICSID, Arbitration Rules |publisher=Icsid.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]]'s [[International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID) is required by ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 22 to make public, information on the registration of all requests for arbitration and to indicate in due course the date and method of the termination of each proceeding. It also publishes the vast majority of awards with the consent of the parties. If the parties do not consent, ICSID publishes excerpts showing the tribunal's reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&amp;actionVal=ShowHome&amp;pageName=Cases_Home |title=International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, ICSID Cases |publisher=Icsid.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICSID website has published awards for most completed arbitrations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&amp;reqFrom=Main&amp;actionVal=OnlineAward |title=International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, View Decisions and Awards |publisher=Icsid.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and decisions in investor-state arbitrations outside of ICSID are also publicly available online.

On 1 April 2014, the [[UNCITRAL]] Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration entered into force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/arbitration/rules-on-transparency/Rules-on-Transparency-E.pdf|format=PDF|title=UNCITRAL : Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration|publisher=Uncitral.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 3 foresees a general duty to publish all documents pertaining to an ISDS-procedure under UNCITRAL Rules, where the treaty establishing the ISDS-mechanism has been concluded after 1 April 2014 or where the parties so consent, subject to certain overwhelming confidentiality interests listed in Article 7. Original proposals to make all UNCITRAL arbitration under investment treaties public were not adopted after opposition by some states and by representatives of the arbitration industry who participated in the UNCITRAL working group negotiations as state representatives.

On 17 March 2015, the United Nations Convention on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration ('Mauritius Convention') was opened for signatures in Port Louis, Mauritius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/2014Transparency_Convention.html|title=2014 - UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration|work=uncitral.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mauritius Convention will render the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor State Arbitration also applicable to disputes arising out of investment treaties that were concluded prior to 1 April 2014 if both parties to the investment treaty are also party to the Mauritius Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Article 3, Mauritius Convention http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/arbitration/transparency-convention/Transparency-Convention-e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention has not yet entered into force since the three required ratifications have not yet been submitted.&lt;ref name="uncitral.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/2014Transparency_Convention_status.html|title=Status|work=uncitral.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 10 States have signed the Mauritius Convention so far.&lt;ref name="uncitral.org"/&gt;

== Tribunals ==
Investment disputes can be initiated by corporations and natural persons and in almost all cases, investment tribunals are composed of three arbitrators (unless otherwise agreed by the parties). As in most [[arbitration]]s, one is appointed by the investor, one by the state, and the third is usually chosen by agreement between the parties or their appointed arbitrators or selected by the appointing authority, depending on the procedural rules applicable to the dispute. If the parties do not agree who to appoint, this power is assigned to executive officials usually at the World Bank, the International Bureau of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, or a private chamber of commerce.

Other individuals cannot initiate a claim against a state under an investment treaty. Also, no individual or state can initiate a claim against a foreign investor under an investment treaty. This has led to criticisms that investor-state arbitration is not balanced and that it favours the "haves" over the "have nots" by giving foreign investors, especially major companies, access to a special tribunal outside any court. While the arbitration process itself does not provide explicitly privileged access for larger investors over individuals or SMEs, the costs of ISDS, as in any court or arbitration system, tend to be off-putting for smaller claimants.

== Examples ==
According to a May 2011 working paper, "In terms of wins and losses, [the] U.S. has never lost a case as the respondent country. U.S. investors have won 15 cases, lost 22 cases and settled 14 cases. In terms of performance with respect to developing countries, U.S. investors have won 14 cases and lost 17."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/179093/2/11-01TreatyArbitrationReappraisal.pdf|title=Working Paper No. 11-01: Investment Treaty Arbitration and Developing Countries: A Re-Appraisal|authors=Kevin P.

=== Dismissed cases ===

; ''KT Asia Investment Group v. Kazakhstan''

: The claimant (company incorporated in Holland) was a shell company owned by Kazakh national (Mr. Ablyazov). It owned shares in BTA Bank, which the claimant alleged were nationalized by the respondent (Kazakhstan). The state position was that as owned by a Kazakh national the claimant was not eligible for investment protection under the Dutch-Kazakh BIT. This argument was dismissed by the Arbitrage. The Kazakh state than alleged that it didn’t nationalize the bank, but it bailed it out (wiping out the shares’ value in the process). The latter was due to the embezzlement of depositors’ trust (and funds) by Mr. Ablyazov. Investigating the matter the Arbitrage reached the conclusion that the investment doesn’t meet the Salini test, thus it is not protected under the BIT. As a result the Arbitrage decided it has no jurisdiction to decide the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;ICSID Case No. ARB/09/8 http://icsidfiles.worldbank.org/icsid/ICSIDBLOBS/OnlineAwards/C620/DC3912_En.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prospects for ISDS ==
After ISDS claims by investors sharply increased starting in the late 1990s, ISDS came under greater public attention and criticism. This was true for the NAFTA claims against the United States in the late 1990s, for Germany in the wake of the [[Vattenfall]] claims in the late 2000s and also for Australia in 2011, when confronted with the Philip Morris claim.&lt;ref name=economist-20141011&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21623756-governments-are-souring-treaties-protect-foreign-investors-arbitration |title=Investor-state dispute settlement - The arbitration game |newspaper=The Economist |date=11 October 2014 |accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Australian government announced that it would discontinue the practice of seeking inclusion of investor state dispute settlement provisions in trade agreements with developing countries. It stated that it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...supports the principle of national treatment — that foreign and domestic businesses are treated equally under the law. However, the Government does not support provisions that would confer greater legal rights on foreign businesses than those available to domestic businesses. Nor will the Government support provisions that would constrain the ability of Australian governments to make laws on social, environmental and economic matters in circumstances where those laws do not discriminate between domestic and foreign businesses. The Government has not and will not accept provisions that limit its capacity to put health warnings or plain packaging requirements on tobacco products or its ability to continue the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme... In the past, Australian Governments have sought the inclusion of investor-state dispute resolution procedures in trade agreements with developing countries at the behest of Australian businesses. The Gillard Government will discontinue this practice. If Australian businesses are concerned about sovereign risk in Australian trading partner countries, they will need to make their own assessments about whether they want to commit to investing in those countries... Foreign businesses investing in Australia will be entitled to the same legal protections as domestic businesses but the Gillard Government will not confer greater rights on foreign businesses through investor-state dispute resolution provisions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acci.asn.au/getattachment/b9d3cfae-fc0c-4c2a-a3df-3f58228daf6d/Gillard-Government-Trade-Policy-Statement.aspx "Trade Policy Statement", Australian Government.] Accessed: 5 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This statement is a reaction to Philip Morris' ISDS claim under [[UNCITRAL]] rules to challenge Australian tobacco Advertising Restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ag.gov.au/internationalrelations/internationallaw/pages/tobaccoplainpackaging.aspx|title=Tobacco plain packaging—investor-state arbitration|publisher=Ag.gov.au|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013,{{Update inline|date=April 2017}} Australia had not terminated any bilateral investment treaties allowing for ISDS. Even if it were to do so, most such treaties foresee post-termination-protection for many years after the termination has become effective. In any event, since the election of the conservative Coalition Government in 2013, the Government has entered into free trade agreements (such as the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, Ch 9 section B) that include ISDS.&lt;ref&gt;http://dfat.gov.au/trade/agreements/chafta/Pages/australia-china-fta.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative way ahead may be the preservation of investor protection under [[public international law]], including ISDS, but with more concern for transparency and the balancing of economic and non-economic interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2014/130710/LDM_BRI(2014)130710_REV2_EN.pdf|format=PDF|title=Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) : State of play and prospects for reform|publisher=Europarl.europa.eu|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted [[#Debates|above]], the [[European Commission]] proposed September 2015) an 'Investment Court System' to replace ISDS clauses (notably in the draft TTIP), with the scope for investor challenge much reduced and with 'highly skilled judges' rather than arbitrators used to determine cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Commission proposes new Investment Court System for TTIP and other EU trade and investment negotiations | url = http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5651_en.htm | work = The European Commission| date = 16 September 2015 | accessdate = 25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this vein, [[Karel De Gucht]], the [[European Commissioner for Trade|EU commissioner]] in charge of negotiating [[International Investment Agreement]]s declared on 18 December 2014 that future agreements shall become more transparent, shall "fully enshrine democratic prerogatives" and "explicitly state that legitimate government public policy decisions – on issues such as the balance between public and private provision of healthcare or "the European ban on chicken carcasses washed with chlorine" – cannot be over-ridden".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/18/wrong-george-monbiot-nothing-secret-eu-trade-deal|title=You're wrong, George Monbiot – there is nothing secret about this EU trade deal|author=Karel De Gucht|work=the Guardian|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced to "crack down on companies using legal technicalities to build frivolous cases against governments", to "open up investment tribunals to public scrutiny – documents will be public and interested parties, including NGOs, will be able to make submissions". Also, he said, the EU "will eliminate any conflicts of interest – the arbitrators who decide on EU cases must be above suspicion". However, insisting equally on the advantages of such investment protection agreements, he states along that [they] "protect job-creating investment from discrimination and unfair treatment" and that "the task here is to find the right balance between preventing abuse and protecting investments".

Current controversies over ISDS appear driven by attempts to expand its scope to new countries and, especially, to relations between developed countries with mature court systems and democratic governments.

In 2014, several members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] expressed opposition to inclusion of ISDS in the proposed [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]] (TTIP) between the United States and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Drake | first = Celeste | title = Powerful Members of Congress Oppose Special 'Corporate Court' Rights for European Firms | publisher = [[AFL–CIO]] | date = 18 December 2014 | url = http://www.aflcio.org/Blog/Political-Action-Legislation/Powerful-Members-of-Congress-Oppose-Special-Corporate-Court-Rights-for-European-Firms | accessdate = 2014-12-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20141221072048/http://www.aflcio.org/Blog/Political-Action-Legislation/Powerful-Members-of-Congress-Oppose-Special-Corporate-Court-Rights-for-European-Firms | archivedate = 21 December 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, faced with opposition to ISDS in several European countries, the European Parliament adopted a resolution requiring any new dispute settlement scheme included in TTIP "must be replaced by a new public and transparent system of investment protection, in which private interests cannot undermine public policy and which is subject to public law".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Euractiv: European Parliament backs TTIP, rejects ISDS|url = http://www.euractiv.com/sections/global-europe/european-parliament-backs-ttip-rejects-isds-316142|accessdate = 2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The Commission's 2015 proposal in response is noted [[#Debates|above]]).

South Africa has stated it will withdraw from treaties with ISDS clauses, and India is also considering such a position. Indonesia plans to let treaties with ISDS clauses lapse when they need renewal. Brazil has refused any treaty with ISDS clauses.&lt;ref name="economist-20141011" /&gt;

In 2018, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that "The arbitration clause in the Agreement between the Netherlands and Slovakia on the protection of investments is not compatible with EU law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2018-03/cp180026en.pdf|title=Judgment in Case C-284/16 - Slowakische Republik v Achmea BV|author=Court of Justice of the European Union|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling could imply that any similar arbitration tribunal considering corporate sovereignty cases would also be illegal under EU law.

'''Jewish emancipation''' was the external (and [[Jewish Enlightenment|internal]]) process in various nations in [[Europe]] of eliminating [[Disabilities (Jewish)|Jewish disabilities]], e.g. [[Jewish quota]]s, to which [[European Jew|Jewish people]] were then subject, and the recognition of Jews as entitled to equality and [[citizenship]] rights on a communal, not merely individual, basis.&lt;ref name=mjl&gt;{{cite news|author=Eli Barnavi|title=Jewish Emancipation in Western Europe |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history/Modern_History/1700-1914/Emancipation_and_Enlightenment/In_the_West.shtml|accessdate=25 September 2013|newspaper=My Jewish Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2016}} It included efforts within the community to integrate into their societies as citizens. It occurred gradually between the late 18th century and the early 20th century. Jewish emancipation followed the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the concurrent [[Haskalah|Jewish enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Shmuel Ettinger|title=Jewish Emancipation and Enlightenment|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history/Modern_History/1700-1914/Emancipation_and_Enlightenment.shtml|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various nations repealed or superseded previous discriminatory laws applied specifically against [[Jews]] where they resided. Before the [[Political emancipation|emancipation]], most Jews were [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|isolated]] in residential areas from the rest of the society; emancipation was a major goal of European Jews of that time, who worked within their communities to achieve [[Social integration|integration]] in the majority societies and broader education. Many became active politically and culturally within wider European [[civil society]] as Jews gained full citizenship. They emigrated to countries offering better social and economic opportunities, such as the [[Russian Empire]] and [[France]]. Some European Jews turned to [[Socialism]], others to Jewish nationalism: [[Zionism]].

==Background==
[[File:Royal decree proclaiming the emancipation of the Jews, France, 1791 - Musée d'art et d'histoire du Judaïsme.jpg|thumb|The 1791 law proclaiming the Emancipation of the Jews - [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme]]]]

Jews were subject to a wide range of restrictions throughout most of European history. Since the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] in 1215, Christian Europeans required Jews and Muslims to wear special clothing, such as the [[Judenhut]] and the [[yellow badge]] for Jews, to distinguish them from Christians. The practice of their religions was often restricted, and they had to swear special oaths (see [[Oath More Judaico]]). Jews were not allowed to vote, where vote existed, and some countries formally prohibited their entry, such as Norway, Sweden and [[History of the Jews in Spain|Spain]] after the expulsion in the late 15th century.

In contrast, in 1264, the Polish [[Bolesław the Pious|Prince Boleslaw the Pious]] issued the "[[Statute of Kalisz]]" – The General Charter of Jewish Liberties in Poland, an unprecedented document in medieval history of Europe that allows Jews personal freedom, legal autonomy and separate tribunal for criminal matters as well as safeguards against forced baptism and blood libel. The Charter was ratified again by subsequent Polish Kings: [[Casimir the Great]] of Poland in 1334, [[Casimir IV of Poland]] in 1453, and [[Sigismund I the Old]] of Poland in 1539. After massive expulsions of Jews from Western Europe (England, France, Germany, and Spain), they found a refuge in the lands of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. During the [[Jagiellon]] Era Poland became the home to Europe's largest Jewish population, as royal edicts warranting Jewish safety and religious freedom from the 13th century contrasted with bouts of persecution in Western Europe, especially following the [[Black Death]] of 1348–1349, blamed by some in the West on Jews themselves. Large parts of Poland suffered relatively little from the outbreak, while the Jewish immigration brought valuable manpower and skills to the rising state. The greatest increase in Jewish numbers occurred in the 18th century, when Jews came to make up 7% of the Polish population.

The rabbinate was the highest goal of many young Jewish men, and the study of the [[Torah]] (the first five books of the Bible) and the [[Talmud]] was the means to obtain the coveted position.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |History}}

Jewish involvement in gentile society began during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. [[Haskalah]], the Jewish movement supporting the adoption of enlightenment values, advocated an expansion of Jewish rights within European society. Haskalah followers advocated "coming out of the [[ghetto]]", not just physically but also mentally and spiritually.

On September 28, 1791, [[French revolution|revolutionary France]] became the second country of the world, after Poland 500 years earlier, to emancipate its Jewish population. The 40,000 Jews living in France at the time were the first to confront the opportunities and challenges offered by emancipation. The civic equality which the French Jews attained became a model for other European Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Paula E. Hyman, ''The Jews of Modern France'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Newfound opportunities began to be provided to the Jewish people, and they slowly pushed toward equality in other parts of the world. In 1796 and 1834, the Netherlands granted the Jews equal rights with gentiles. Napoleon freed the Jews in areas he conquered in Europe outside France (see [[Napoleon and the Jews]]). Greece granted equal rights to Jews in 1830. But, it was not until the revolutions of the mid-19th century that [[Jewish political movement]]s would begin to persuade governments in Great Britain, Central and Eastern Europe to grant equal rights to Jews.&lt;ref name=jvl&gt;{{cite web |title=EMANCIPATION |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0006_0_05916.html |work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |access-date=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emancipation movements==
The early stages of Jewish emancipation movements were part of the general progressive efforts to achieve freedom and rights for minorities. While this was a movement, it was also a pursuit for equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Judaism|last=Nicholas|first=de Lange|last2=Freud-Kandel|first2=Miri|last3=C. Dubin|first3=Lois|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=30–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the emancipation movement would be a long process.  The question of equal rights for Jews was tied to demands for constitutions and civil rights in various nations. Jewish statesmen and intellectuals, such as [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Johann Jacoby]], [[Gabriel Riesser]], [[Berr Isaac Berr]], and [[Lionel Nathan Rothschild]], worked with the general movement toward liberty and political freedom, rather than for Jews specifically.&lt;ref name=ohio.edu/&gt;

In 1781, the Prussian civil servant [[Christian Wilhelm von Dohm|Christian Wilhelm Dohm]] published the famous script ''Über die bürgerliche Emanzipation der Juden''. Dohm disproves the antisemitic stereotypes and pleads for equal rights for Jews. Till this day, it is called the ''Bible of Jewish emancipation''.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Stollberg-Rilinger: Europa im Jahrhundert der Aufklärung. Stuttgart: Reclam, 2006 (2nd edition), 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of persistent [[anti-Jewish]] incidents and [[Blood libel against Jews|blood libels]], such as the [[Damascus affair]] of 1840, and the failure of many states to emancipate the Jews, Jewish organizations formed to push for the emancipation and protection of their people. The [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] under [[Moses Montefiore]], the [[Central Consistory]] in Paris, and the ''[[Alliance Israelite Universelle]]'' all began working to assure the freedom of Jews.

Jewish emancipation, implemented under Napoleonic rule in French occupied and annexed states, suffered a setback in many member states of the [[German Confederation]] following the decisions of the [[Congress of Vienna]]. In the final revision of the Congress on the rights of the Jews, the emissary of the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]], [[Johann Smidt]] - unauthorised and unconsented to by the other parties - altered the text from "The confessors of Jewish faith are preserved the rights already conceded to them '''in''' the confederal states", by replacing a single word, which entailed serious consequences, into: "The confessors of Jewish faith are preserved the rights already conceded to them '''by''' the confederal states."&lt;ref&gt;In the German original: "Es werden den Bekennern des jüdischen Glaubens die denselben '''in''' ['''von''', respectively] den einzelnen Bundesstaaten bereits eingeräumten Rechte erhalten." Cf. [[Heinrich Graetz]], ''Geschichte der Juden von den ältesten Zeiten bis auf die Gegenwart'': 11 vols., Leipzig: Leiner, 1900, vol. 11: 'Geschichte der Juden vom Beginn der Mendelssohnschen Zeit (1750) bis in die neueste Zeit (1848)', p. 317. Emphasis not in the original. Reprint of the edition  revised by the author: Berlin: Arani, 1998, {{ISBN|3-7605-8673-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of German states used the altered text version as legal grounds to reverse the Napoleonic emancipation of Jewish citizens. The Prussian emissary [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] and the Austrian [[Klemens von Metternich]] promoted the preservation of Jewish emancipation, as maintained by their own countries, but were not successful in others.&lt;ref name="ohio.edu"&gt;Sharfman, Glenn R.,  [http://www.ohio.edu/chastain/ip/jewemanc.htm Jewish Emancipation], in [http://www.ohio.edu/chastain/contents.htm Encyclopedia of 1848 Revolutions]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Revolutions of 1848]], Jewish emancipation was granted by the Basic Rights of the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] (Paragraph 13), which said that civil rights were not to be conditional on religious faith. But only some German states introduced the Frankfurt parliamentary decision as state law, such as Hamburg; other states were reluctant. Important German states, such as [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] (1812), [[Kingdom of Württemberg|Württemberg]] (1828), [[Electorate of Hesse]] (1833), and [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] (1842), had already emancipated their Jews as citizens. By doing so, they hoped to educate the gentiles, and terminate laws which sought to oppress the Jews.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although the movement was mostly successful; some early emancipated Jewish communities continued to suffer persisting or new ''de facto'', though not legal, discrimination against those Jews trying to achieve careers in public service and education. Those few states that had refrained from Jewish emancipation were forced to do so by an act of the [[North German Federation]] on 3 July 1869, or when they acceded to the newly [[German Empire|united Germany]] in 1871. The emancipation of all Jewish Germans was reversed by [[Nazi Germany]] from 1933 through [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=jvl/&gt;

==Dates of emancipation==
In some countries, emancipation came with a single act. In others, limited rights were granted first in the hope of "changing" the Jews "for the better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friends-partners.org/partners/beyond-the-pale/eng_captions/21-5.html |title=THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN ANTI-SEMITISM: images pg.21 |publisher=Friends-partners.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==

===The emancipation and the practice of Judaism===
{{editorial|date=September 2016}}The emancipation disrupted the relationship the Jews had with their religion, which could not govern any longer all the actions in their lives. Many considered a practice of Judaism more closely to the lifestyle of their non-Jewish fellow citizens. The emancipation in France, Italy, Germany, at least during the Empire, permitted many Jews to leave the ghettos and contribute, as a result of the [[Haskalah]], to the development of [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] during the 19th century. The emancipation contributed moreover to the assimilation of Jews and sometimes to their cultural disappearance when Jews merged through marriage in the surrounding society. It was not until Rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] defined a modern vision of orthodox Judaism, enabling orthodox Jews to participate fully in a society.&lt;ref name=jvl/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2016|reason=SR Hirsch's movement is not discussed in source}}{{ clarify | date = January 2016 | reason =sentence is a grammatical fragment, thought incomplete }} Ultimately, emancipation immersed the Jews into a new culture. In doing so, Jews were able to not only see themselves as members of a religious sect, but also as citizens within society. At the same time, however, some {{who|date=September 2016}} were concerned that leaders within the Jewish movement were seeking to position Judaism with an approach catered toward a new Western civilization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Judaism|last=C.

'''Kasaya''' is attachment to worldly objects and is an obstacle in the path leading to [[Nirvikalpa]] [[Samadhi]]: it is overcome through [[viveka]], discrimination.

==Meaning==

'''Kasaya''' or ''Kashāya'' ([[Sanskrit]]: कषाय) means, 'astringent', 'decay', 'smearing', 'juice', 'degeneracy', 'anointing',  'gum', 'resin', 'red-brown', 'stupidity', 'defect', 'fragrant'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url= http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B7%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AF&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also means 'attachment to worldly objects' or to 'the yellowish-red garments worn by monks'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English dictionary|author=Vaman Shivaram Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.2.apte.250899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

[[Sadananda (of Vedantasara)|Sadananda]] defines ''Kasaya'' as attachment to worldly objects, the failure of the mental state to rest on the Absolute, owing to the numbness brought on by impressions due to attachment even when there is no torpidity or distraction ([[Vedantasara (of Sadananda)|Vedantasara]])  (Sl.212).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedantasara Ed.1931|author=Sadananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|page=120|url= http://www.estudantedavedanta.net/Vedantasara-Nikhilananda.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Vedanta]],  the word Kasaya denotes metaphorically a rigid state of mind hardened by one's own inclinations and passions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese Culture|publisher=Chinese Cultural Research Institute|page=69|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QF8bAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Kasaya+Vedanta&amp;dq=Kasaya+Vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nYsyU5fiG8j_rQfK-YHoCQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAjg8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jiva==

Rishi Gautama Nodha ([[Rig Veda]] I.58.3) describes the [[Jiva]] in the following words:-

:क्राणा रुद्रेभिर्वसुभिः पुरोहितो होता निषत्तो रयिषाळमर्त्यः|
:रथो न विक्ष्वृञ्जसान आयुषु वयानुषग्वार्या देव ऋण्वति ||

:"That is the Jiva (क्राणा – the spotless achiever of good deeds) who should be known as the one who moves about (निसत्तः) in the bodily form (होता) applying and enjoying all substances and thoughts (the gross and the fine) all the while attached to this earth or world (वसुभिः) guided and impelled by the [[Prana]]s (रुद्रेभिः) experiencing the varying stages of birth, growth, maturity etc., (आयुषु) and all attendant consequences (ॠञ्ज्सानः) with a view to enjoying the desired happiness and comfort though in reality by itself it is pure and undying. "

And, Rishi Kumaro Yamayana ([[Rig Veda]] X.135.6) in the following mantra explains

:यथाभवदनुदेयी ततो अग्रमजायत |
:पुरस्ताद् बुध्न आततः पश्चान्निरयणं कृतम् ||

that the Paramatman "universal Soul" is the primordial existence, remaining throughout creation, omnipresent, even as the Jivatman "individual Soul" dons a body and experiences bondage to "material objectives" and duality or (unknowing) of that omniprescence &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|pages=285, 236|url=https://openlibrary.org/search?author_key=OL6886704A&amp;has_fulltext=false&amp;publisher_facet=GBD+Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the ''Jiva'', who by its actions, attracts to itself the ''[[pudgala]]s'' (the tendencies that keep an individual re-incarnating), which results in its bondage; all that one enjoys or suffers from are the products of karmas, good or bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bases of Indian Culture|author=Amiya Kumar Mazumdar|publisher=Ramakrishna Vedanta Math|page=324|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dZMtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Kasaya+Vedanta&amp;dq=Kasaya+Vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nYsyU5fiG8j_rQfK-YHoCQ&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAzg8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaudapada’s exposition==

[[Gaudapada]] (Gaudapada Karika III.44-45) warns that the seeker after truth should not linger on the bliss of [[Savikalpa]] [[Samadhi]] because that enjoyment (''rasavada''), after ''Laya'', ''[[Vikṣepa|Vikshepa]]'' and ''Kasaya'', is the fourth kind of obstacle in the path to [[Nirvikalpa]] [[Samadhi]]; one should be unattached through "viveka", discrimination.  Attachment is a weakness of the mind as it is not easily disciplined  to withdraw from the enjoyment and related effects arising out of desire. He explains: as in dreams where the mind vibrates with dual aspects, so too in the waking state these aspects seem to be all that there is but when the state of"nirati", dissolution of the mind is achieved, duality is no longer perceived. The conduct of the mind in deep sleep (when it loses itself) is not like its conduct in the controlled state (when it does not lose itself), and

:ग्रहो न तत्र नोत्सर्गश्चिन्ता यत्र न विद्यते |
:आत्मसंस्थं तदा ज्ञानमजाति समतां गतम् ||

:"there may be no duality where all mental activity ceases: then, the jivatma attaining oneness with the knowable Brahman becomes established in the Self, unborn and poised in equality" (Gaudapada Karika III.38).

Torpidity or ''Laya'' (लय) is overwhelm of the senses and the mental state, falling asleep unable to maintain awareness of the Absolute; and distraction or ''Vikshepa'' (विक्षेप) is through failing to be able to rest the mental state on the Absolute, resting it on other things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eight Upanishads|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=305–322|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

[[Patanjali]] (Yoga Sutras II.2) – समाधि – भवनार्थः क्लेश – तनूकरनार्थश्च – assures that by cultivating the power of concentration the obstacles - which cause all suffering -  in the way of enlightenment -  can be removed. The obstacles he refers to are the negative effects of ignorance, egoism, attachment, aversion and the desire to cling to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Patanjali Yoga Sutras|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=67–68|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, as regards the enjoyment of bliss attained coinciding the gain of non-conceptual knowledge   [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] advocating  the understanding of the depth-meaning (lakshyatha) of the Mahavakya [[Tat Twam Asi]], states

:प्रत्यग्बोधो या आभाति द्वयानन्दलक्षणः |
:अद्वयानन्दरूपश्च प्रत्यग्बोधैकलक्षणः ||

:"What appears (as the Witness Consciousness within – the individual Self), is of the nature of Bliss One-without- a- second;   and the one that is the Bliss within is none other than the individualized self the Witnessing Consciousness within"

– which statement  means that owing to the conditioning (vikshepa) in the Jiva, the individual can experience only the "awareness" and not the "bliss" aspect of Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vakya Vritti of Adi Sankara|publisher=Central Chinmaya Mission Trust|page=79|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legalism''' (or nomism), in [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology]], is the act of putting the [[Law of Moses]] above the gospel, which is 1 Corinthians 15:1-4, by establishing requirements for [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] beyond [[Sola fide|faith]] (trust) in [[Jesus Christ]], specifically, trust in His finished work - the shedding of His blood for our sins, and reducing the broad, inclusive, and general precepts of the [[Bible]] to narrow and rigid [[Morality|moral]] codes.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel G. Reid et al., Dictionary of Christianity in America (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; It is an over-emphasis of discipline of conduct, or legal ideas, usually implying an allegation of misguided rigour, pride, [[superficiality]], the neglect of mercy, and ignorance of the [[divine grace|grace of God]] or [[Letter and spirit of the law|emphasizing the letter of law at the expense of the spirit]]. Legalism is alleged against any view that obedience to law, not [[Faith in Christianity|faith in God's grace]], is the pre-eminent principle of [[Salvation#Redemption|redemption]]. On the viewpoint that redemption is not earned by works, but that obedient faith is required to enter and remain in the redeemed state, see [[covenantal nomism]].

==In the New Testament==
The words 'legalism' or 'legalist' do not occur in the Old or New Testaments.  Legalism's root word, "law" (Greek ''nomos''), occurs frequently in the [[New Testament]], and sometimes is interpreted as legalism.  In 1921, Ernest De Witt Burton stated that in {{bibleverse||Gal.|2:16}}, "''nomou'' is here evidently used ... in its legalistic sense, denoting [[divine law]] viewed as a purely legalistic system made up of statutes, on the basis of obedience or disobedience to which individuals are approved or condemned as a matter of debt without grace. This is divine law as the legalist defined it."&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Ernest De Witt, ''The International Critical Commentary, Galatians'', 1921, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] day lacked any term corresponding to the distinct position of "legalism", "legalist", or "legalistic", leading [[C.E.B. Cranfield]] to commend "the possibility that [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Pauline statements which at first sight seem to disparage the law]], were really directed not against the law itself but against that misunderstanding and misuse of it for which we now have a convenient terminology" (legalism).&lt;ref&gt;Cranfield, C.E.B., ''The International Critical Commentary, Romans'', 1979, p. 853.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Messianic Jew]]ish Bible translator [[David H. Stern]] cited these two scholars to support the translation framework that often "&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''nomos''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; means 'legalism' and not God's ''[[Torah]]''", especially in Paul's constructs ''erga nomou'' (literally [[New Perspective on Paul#Works of the Law|"works of law"]], rendered by Stern "legalistic observance of ''Torah'' commands") and ''upo nomon'' (literally "under law", rendered by Stern by 13 words, "in subjection to the system which results from perverting the ''Torah'' into legalism").&lt;ref&gt;Stern, David H., ''Jewish New Testament Commentary'', 1992, pp. 535–8, 552–3, on Gal. 2:16b, 3:23b.&lt;/ref&gt;

One concept of legalism, the belief that salvation can be earned by obedience to laws, is referred to in various New Testament books, including Galatians. In this case, some [[Jewish Christians|Jews who had become Christians]] believed that in order to obtain salvation, both faith in Christ (as [[Messiah]]), and obedience to the Mosiac laws were required, such as the cases of the [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision controversy]] and the [[Incident at Antioch]]. Generally, however, these cases are referred to as the [[Judaizer]] controversy, rather than a legalism controversy, but the two are related.

Legalism refers to any doctrine which states salvation comes strictly from adherence to the law.  It can be thought of as a works-based religion.  Groups in the New Testament said to be falling into this category include the [[Pharisees]], [[Sadducees]], [[Scribes]], [[Judaizers]], and [[Nicolaitans]].  They are legalists because they emphasized obeying the [[613 Mitzvot|Law of Moses]], in the case of the Pharisees and Scribes, to the letter without understanding the concept of grace.  Jesus condemned their legalism in [[Woes of the Pharisees|Matthew 23]].  The Pharisees love of the praises of men for their strict adherence is said to be a prime example of legalism.

Legalism is sometimes confused with obedience.  New Testament books such as Romans, speak of grace and obedience together. An example is found in Romans 1:5 (New American Standard Version) speaking of Christ 'through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles, for His name's sake...' The goal of receiving the grace was to bring about obedience of faith. Here grace, faith and obedience are tied together. Other references are in Acts 5:29, 32; Romans 16:19; 2 Corinthians 7:15; Hebrews 5:9.

Legalism is also confused with discipline, which is often spoken of in a positive light.  See 1 Corinthians 9:17; 1 Timothy 4:7; 2 Timothy 1:7 and Hebrews 12:5–11.

A third common misunderstanding of legalism is the word law.  Law in many places in the Bible refers to the Law of Moses, see also [[Biblical law in Christianity]].  In Galatians the Judaizers were trying to insist that salvation required that a person be circumcised prior to obeying the [[Law of Christ]].  Galatians 2:16 says,  "Knowing that a man is not justified by the [[New Perspective on Paul#Works of the Law|works of the law]], but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified" (King James Version).  The faith here is the [[Law of Christ]] and the law here is the Law of Moses.  The legalism of the Judaizers was that obedience to  the law of Moses was necessary to be saved.

Legalism in the New Testament is believed by some as being revealed by the life of Saul prior to his [[Conversion of Paul|conversion]].  Some believe that Saul sought to redeem himself by his works of persecution of the church and its ultimate destruction.  Acts 26:9–11 reveals, "I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Which thing I also did in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to [[blaspheme]]; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities" (King James Version). Galatians 1:13–14 states, "For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly [[Zealots#Paul the Apostle|zealous]] of the traditions of my fathers" (King James Version).  These two texts emphasize the nature of Saul's religion, works.

However, in this passage the obedience is not tied to the obeying of specific Old Testament laws, such as keeping [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] or circumcision.

[[Image:Saint James the Just.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Icon of [[James the Just]], whose judgment was adopted in the [[Apostolic Decree]] of {{bibleverse||Acts|15:19–29}}, c. AD 50.]]

At the [[Council of Jerusalem]], c. 50, [[James the Just]] decreed the ''Apostolic Decree'':
: "Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the [[Gentiles]] are turned to God: But that we write unto them, that they abstain from [[idolatry|pollutions of idols]], and [from] [[fornication]], and [from] things strangled, and [from] [[Taboo food#Blood|blood]].{{ref|4}} For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the [[synagogues]] every [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] day" ({{bibleref|Acts|15:19–21|KJV}}).

Though the ''Apostolic Decree'' is no longer observed by many [[Christian denominations]] today, it is still observed in full by the [[Greek Orthodox]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Josef von Hefele]]'s [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.viii.v.iv.ii.html commentary on canon II of Gangra] notes: "We further see that, at the time of the Synod of [[Gangra]], the rule of the Apostolic Synod with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the Greeks, indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show. [[Balsamon]] also, the well-known commentator on the canons of the Middle Ages, in his commentary on the sixty-third [[Canons of the Apostles|Apostolic Canon]], expressly blames the Latins because they had ceased to observe this command. What the Latin Church, however, thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] in his work [[Contra Faustum]], where he states that the Apostles had given this command in order to unite the heathens and Jews in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things strangled and blood had lost its meaning, and was only observed by few. But still, as late as the eighth century, [[Pope Gregory III|Pope Gregory the Third]] (731) forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days. No one will pretend that the disciplinary enactments of any council, even though it be one of the undisputed [[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical Synods]], can be of greater and more unchanging force than the decree of that first council, held by the Holy Apostles at Jerusalem, and the fact that its decree has been obsolete for centuries in the West is proof that even Ecumenical canons may be of only temporary utility and may be repealed by disuse, like other laws."&lt;/ref&gt; and it was a very effective philosophy during that time.

== In intra-Christian relations ==

===Roman Catholic Church===
In [[Roman Catholicism]], [[good works]] are done in service to God and one's neighbour, by faith working through love.  In contrast, a severity in the imposition of, or overly scrupulous conformity to any rule of piety, may be charged with legalism.

In an attempt to resolve the dispute over legalism, the [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]] was a document issued in 1999 by Lutheran-Catholic clerical representatives, declaring a common belief in ''[[Sola gratia]]'', that grace alone can save the faithful, and that there is a ''progressive infusion'' of grace in the spirit of the believer.

===Eastern Orthodox Churches===
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], for another example, rejects the [[Atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction theory of the atonement]] as ''legalistic''.  The satisfaction theory states that mankind's [[Original Sin]] violated God's law, resulting in all men being born guilty: an idea prevalent in the writings of [[Tertullian]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] of the [[Western Church]].  [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]] formally developed the theory that the legal problem of guilt before the Law, required the legal solution of retribution, in order to achieve a just salvation. The solution was for God's son Jesus to willingly die on the [[Cross]] in place of humanity, thus allowing the legal penalty to be fully carried out, satisfying the justice of God, and thus clearing the way for mercy to be shown to sinners.  The Eastern Orthodox charge that this theory is too dependent upon Roman legal concepts of retribution and justice. [citation needed]

===Protestant Churches===
In [[Protestant]], [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]], [[Christian]] [[theology]], especially in popular versions of the same, the charge of legalism is an accusation of overzealous adherence to the word of the Bible (as law) in all things said, established or accomplished in a believer's life (cf. [[bibliolatry]]). In that context, to apply the criticism of legalism to a theological position or religious attitude implies that the accused has overturned the Gospel of [[salvation]] through [[faith]] and new life in Jesus Christ and has instead substituted some principle of personal works of strict adherence to the word, through action, thought, or speech for the unearned [[divine grace|grace]] of God.

===In history===

Throughout the [[history of Christianity]], certain beliefs and practices have tended to draw charges of legalism.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the article/interview [http://www.puntoacroce.altervista.org/_Den/T1-Legalismo_Sh.htm "Il legalismo? Parliamone (Legalism? Let's talk about it)"], with the participation of Nicola Martella, Alessandro Ceralli, Silvano Creaco, ''et al.'' {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

* [[Asceticism]], such as [[fasting]] and other forms of self-denial.
* The keeping of [[Christian Sabbath]], especially regarding prohibitions of various otherwise innocent activities on the day of worship.
* Various extra-biblical [[religious law|ordinances]] and customs that become associated not just with wisdom but with holiness, in the contemporary situation, such as prohibitions against [[theater]], [[movies]], [[dance|dancing]], [[rock music]], [[playing card]]s, [[interracial marriage]] or [[mixed bathing]].
* Total abstinence from alcohol (See also [[Christianity and alcohol]].)
* [[Ritualism]], a superficial or superstitious use of customary [[prayer]]s and [[liturgy]].
* Similarly, certain exclusive [[ritual]] practices, such as rigorous insistence on the [[tetragrammaton]] as the only name by which God is honored, dietary laws, [[Saturday Sabbath]], or [[Passover (Christian holiday)]], especially when practicing these rituals is held necessary for salvation.
* [[Sacrament]]s, especially when the underlying theology allegedly views them as communicating God's grace automatically (compare [[ex opere operato]]).
* Various rigorous and restrictive beliefs, such as that, [[King-James-Only Movement|only the King James Version]] of the Bible constitutes God's word.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''int. al.'', [https://books.google.com/books/about/One_Bible_Only.html?id=uQWTxDdIO6IC&amp;redir_esc=y Beacham, Roy E.; Kevin T. Bauder, ''One Bible Only?

Several underlying dynamics appear in these controversies.  The permitted scope of [[veneration]] of material objects versus claims that such veneration is [[idolatry]], affects the perceived sanctity of ritual spaces and objects, and therefore of the rituals and customs themselves.

'''Life cycle thinking''' is an approach to becoming mindful of how [[everyday life]] [[environmental impact|affects the environment]]. This approach evaluates how both [[Consumption (economics)|consuming]] products and engaging in activities impacts the environment but it not only evaluates them at one single step, but takes a [[holistic]] picture of an entire product or activity system. 
This means when talking about a product and taking a life cycle thinking approach, what is actually being evaluated is the impact of the activity of consuming that product. This is because by consuming a product, a series of associated activities are required to make it happen. For example, the raw material extraction, material processing, transportation, distribution, consumption, reuse/recycling, and disposal must all be considered when evaluating the environmental impact. This is called the [[product life cycle|life cycle of a product]]. The overall idea of making a holistic evaluation of a system's effect can be defined as life cycle thinking. 

Life cycle thinking therefore also can be applied to the consumption of other socio-economic activities such as watching a movie, making arts and crafts, cooking dinner, or even doing homework. For example, renting a movie, which seems to be a harmless activity, would involve burning gasoline to drive to the video store, using electricity to power the television and DVD player, and consuming power from the remote’s batteries. 
However, when trying to analyze quantitatively the effects of life cycles, limits to evaluation are subject to what assessment approach is taken because the chain reaction can become so complex that it could require decades to figure out the life cycle of a specific process. Life cycle thinking overall is a way to become more mindful of the complexities of consuming products and engaging in activities and how they affect the environment.

== Goals==
The goal of life cycle thinking is to make people and companies more aware of how their actions impact the environment in a holistic sense rather than a one time pollution that comes as a direct result of using a product or doing an activity at one specific time. Although it is nearly impossible to undergo consumption of anything with no environmental impact, life cycle thinking can help people make better alternative decisions to mitigate their environmental impact. One of the goals of life cycle thinking is to avoid burden shifting.&lt;ref name="European Commission" /&gt; This is to make sure that reducing the environmental impact at one stage in the life cycle does not increase the impact at other places in the cycle. For example, plug in [[electric cars]] reduce the amount of gasoline burned but they increase the amount of electricity used which is usually generated by other polluting energy sources such as coal. Life cycle thinking can also demonstrate the benefits to technological innovation. For example, movies can now be downloaded through television service providers and gaming devices which eliminates the need to drive to a DVD rental location. By identifying pollution costs, companies can innovate to mitigate their expenses while consumers can make better alternative choices to mitigate their impact.

* Avoid burden shifting
* Reveal the complexity of the system triggered by an action which can have several negative environmental effects.
* Connect people more directly with the impacts of their life style and demonstrate how each action has a reaction which is sometimes asymmetrically worse for the environment.
* Make companies more mindful of environmental impacts of their operations.
: Help identify cost cutting possibilities
: Help identify less harmful operation strategies
* Provide people with a framework to make choices that over a life cycle have less environmental impacts.
* Create a culture focused on sustainability rather than short term gratification.

== Sectors==
Life-cycle thinking has applications in many sectors, such as the following:&lt;ref name="European Commission Sectors"&gt;{{cite web|title=Life Cycle Thinking in sectors|url=http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/sectors|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agriculture ===

The [[agriculture]]/[[food industry|food sector]] is a big source environmental impacts that occur throughout the lifetime of a product, from farm to table to disposal.  Life-cycle thinking works to reduce these impacts at all stages of food production. Nutrition, health, well being, cultural identity and lifestyle are also factors that should be addressed when looking at the impacts of choices made in food production to ensure decreases in emissions and environmental impact do not occur at the expense of consumer wellbeing.

=== Manufacturing ===

A product Life Cycle Analysis involves all production and service processes involved in the manufacturing of a product throughout its life-cycle. This includes the production of materials needed to make the product. Since the manufacturing sector is a big emitter of pollutants and user of natural resources, pinpointing areas in which to decrease environmental impact throughout the manufacturing process is a big part of life-cycle thinking.

=== Energy ===

Drastic increases in [[atmospheric CO2]] caused by the burning of [[fossil fuels]], has led to the search for alternative energy sources like [[biofuels]] and [[renewable energy sources]]. To analyze whether or not these alternative sources have overall less environmental impact then conventional energy sources, life-cycle analysis is needed. Life-cycle thinking is an intricate part of finding new energy sources that have an overall smaller impact on the environment.

=== Waste management ===

Life-cycle thinking and analysis can help reduce negative environmental impacts of [[waste]] generation and [[waste management|management]]. This includes looking at ways to reduce waste production, increase [[recycling]], and dispose of waste in a more [[environmentally friendly]] way. This is complicated by differences in benefits and burdens of in different geographical regions and the fact that effects usually occur over long periods of time. Furthermore, benefits and burdens of different processes can occur in many different forms and can be difficult to identify, quantify and compare.

=== Retail ===

[[Retail]] often accounts for a significant portion of economies and thus can have huge implications in terms of environmental impacts. The life cycle of a product in retail would include the complete supply-chain of the product, its use and disposal or end-of-life treatment.

=== Construction ===

There are many uses for life-cycle thinking in [[construction]], especially in terms of construction waste and waste management. Finding better ways to recycle waste and prevent waste are important to reduce negative environmental impact of the [[construction industry]].

For construction products in Europe, a standardised methodology for building assessment considering [[Environmental product declaration|Environmental Products Declarations]] (EPD) has been approved. The main standards are EN 15978 (buildings) and EN 15804 (products).

=== Transport ===

Finding alternative fuel sources are the biggest challenges to reducing negative environmental impact in the [[transportation]] sector. Biofuels are becoming increasing popular as an alternative to fossil fuels. Life cycle analysis can provide a fuller picture of the extent alternative fuel sources reduce emissions and overall environmental impact compared to conventional fuels.

=== Services ===

Service industries play a big part in adding environmental burdens, especially in terms of [[greenhouse gas emissions]] generated by [[travel]] and [[tourist industry|tourist industries]]. The [[service industry]] is expected to play a larger part in the modern economy as "[[Dematerialization (economics)|dematerialization]]", or the replacement of manufactured goods by services in many firms, plays a bigger role in the economy.

== Approaches ==

There are many different approaches to life cycle thinking that all involve looking at life cycle-generated impacts and ways to minimize these impacts. An important component to life cycle approaches is avoiding burden shifting, in other words, ensuring that improvements in one stage are not achieved at the expense of another stage. Approaches of impact measurement focus on decreasing environmental impact and resource use throughout all stages of a process.&lt;ref name="Why Life Cycle Approach?"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Take a Life Cycle Approach?|url=http://www.unep.fr/shared/publications/pdf/DTIx0585xPA-WhyLifeCycleEN.pdf|publisher=UNEP|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

Commonly used approaches:

=== Life-cycle assessment ===

[[Life-cycle assessment]] (LCA or life cycle analysis) is a technique used to assess potential environmental impacts of a product at different stages of its life. This technique takes a "cradle-to-grave" or a "[[Cradle-to-cradle design|cradle to cradle]]" approach and looks at environmental impacts that occur throughout the lifetime of a product from raw material extraction, manufacturing and processing, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, disposal and recycling.

=== Life cycle management (LCM)===

[[Product lifecycle|Life cycle management]] is a business approach to manage the total life cycle of products and services. It follows the life cycle thinking that businesses, through the activities they must perform, have environmental, social and economic impacts. LCM is used to understand and analyze life cycle stages of products and services of a business, identify potential economic, social or environmental risks and opportunities at each stage and create ways to act upon those opportunities and reduce potential risks.&lt;ref name="Life Cycle Management"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Life Cycle Management (LCM)|url=http://www.epa.vic.gov.au/lifecycle/whatis.asp|publisher=EPA|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Life cycle costing (LCC) ===

[[Whole-life cost|Life cycle costing]] (or life cycle cost analysis) is the total cost analysis of a process or system. This includes costs incurred over the life of the system and is frequently used to find most cost-effective means for providing goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life Cycle Costing|url=http://photovoltaics.sandia.gov/docs/LCcost.htm|publisher=Sandia National Laboratories|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design for the Environment ===

[[File:DfE Logo.pdf|thumb|DfE Logo]]

[[Design for the Environment]] Program (DfE) was created in 1992 by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and works to prevent pollution and the reduce the risks pollution presents to humans and the environment. The main goals of the DfE are to promote green cleaning, recognize safer industrial and consumer products through safer product labeling, define best practices in production and manufacturing, and identify safer chemicals for these processes based on life cycle thinking. Having said this they must know that the air pollution in USA has the mixing of [[liquid]], [[solid]], [[gaseous]], odour and noise pollution which is dangerous for human being, animals and plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whatisusa.info/pollution-in-usa/|title=Pollution in USA|publisher=What is USA |date=23 April 2013 | accessdate=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Product service system ===

[[Product-service system|Product service systems (PSS)]] are sets of marketable products and services that work together to fulfill a user’s needs.  This new approach is a result of firms realizing that services in combination with products can provide higher profits and customer satisfaction then simply selling products alone. Firms that use PSS work to find ways to maximize the use of their product throughout its lifetime, using services to supplement its usage.  PSS has been seen to have smaller environmental impact than traditional business models, as the focus on services has led to a decrease in material production and consumption. This applies to life cycle thinking because it involves looking at the life-cycle cost of a product (i.e. maintenance and storage costs) for a consumer and reducing that cost by providing services with the purchased good.

=== Integrated product policy (IPP) ===

Integrated product policy works to minimize environmental degradation caused by products by looking at all phases of a product’s life-cycle to pinpoint where taking action is most effective. This also uses a cradle-to-grave approach when looking at a product’s life. In addition, it is important that policies avoid burden shifting and do not decrease environment emissions at one stage of development at the expense of another. Policy measures used to action upon recommendations include economic instruments, substance bans, voluntary agreements, environmental labeling and product design guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Integrated Product Policy|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ipp/integratedpp.htm|publisher=European Commission on Environment|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

There are multiple situations to which life cycle thinking can be applied, including the everyday life of consumers, business and government policy.  By applying life cycle thinking to multiple aspects of the community, consumers, businesses and governments can have a largely positive aspect on the environment.  This is true even if the steps taken to apply life cycle thinking are small.

=== Consumers ===

Each day consumers make choices as to which products they would like to use based on their needs and the different brands available.  However, most consumers do not take into consideration the environmental impacts of the product when they make their choice.  For example, consumers do not consider the [[Energy consumption|product's energy usage]], [[Unfree labour|questionable labor conditions]] that produced it, [[hazardous waste]] from production, impacts on the [[ecosystem]], or pollution of [[Air pollution|air]] or [[Water pollution|water]].  

Consumers can apply life cycle thinking in multiple different ways with regards to their product choices in order to reduce their impact on the environment. Firstly, consumers can choose to use products from companies who take strides towards sustainability.  Many companies provide [[Sustainability reporting|sustainability reports]] that consumers can read to educate themselves about the companies they buy from.  By using life cycle thinking, consumers can choose a company with smaller production impacts.

Primarily, consumer usage has the largest impact on the environment throughout a product's life.  By using life cycle thinking this impact can be reduced.  This would require [[Consumer education|educating consumers]] to make better choices about product usage.  This can come from the companies who provide the service or product or from government agencies.  For example, consumers can ask themselves what impacts they have while using the product.  Ask do I really need to use this or is there a more sustainable option, such as hang drying laundry on a nice day rather than using a dryer. Consumers can educate themselves on how to become more sustainable themselves through life cycle thinking rather than relying on companies and the government to be sustainable for them.

=== Businesses ===

Businesses are responsible for many choices about their services and products each day.  By applying life cycle thinking, businesses can recognize the potential impacts of their choices.  They consider how each design and manufacturing decision has an effect on the environment and how they can make it more sustainable.  Businesses not only take into consideration how the product is made, but also how the product will be used and disposed of by the user.  Companies try to have a more sustainable product by making products recyclable or reusable. They challenging part is balancing cost and sustainable choices.  Life cycle thinking allows them to see the best sustainable options but is limited when it comes to pricing these choices.  Life cycle thinking for businesses entails consideration of where to obtain raw material, how to manufacture the material, transporting, distributing, using, and disposing of the product.  By looking at all of these phases businesses make the best choices for themselves and the consumer for a lower impact on the environment.

=== Governments ===

Government plays a key role in life cycle thinking by establishing policies to regulate environmental impacts.   By applying life cycle thinking policy makers can set standards that businesses and consumers need to meet.  They do so by gathering information as a baseline of the environmental impact and use that to set goals based on knowledge from life cycle thinking.  They can also use trends from supply chains of different businesses they regulate to determine where the biggest influence can be made to majorly reduce the impacts of the businesses.  Government sectors can also use life cycle thinking to better educate consumers.  Requiring labels on products describing the impacts the product has and how to use the products in order to reduce the impact can be an important role for the government.  Regulating supply chains and consumers with policy is motivational as negative reinforcement.  Life cycle thinking provides a methodology for creating those policies in order to have the most effective and most cost efficient means of reducing environmental impacts.

== In policy ==
Many consumers, when making decisions on what to buy and what not to buy, consider the environmental impact of the particular product. Policy makers recognize this desire, and act to create policy that not only helps consumers do this, but will do so while keeping a growing economy in mind.

=== European policy ===


[[File:JRC logo.gif|thumb|JRC logo]]

There are many aspects of life cycle thinking incorporated into European policy. The [[Sustainable Consumption and Production Action Plan]] is a piece of legislation that aims to reduce environmental impact and consumption of resources associated with the complete life cycles of goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life Cycle Thinking in European Policy|url=http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/|work=Life Cycle Thinking and Assessment|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112081845/http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/|archivedate=2011-11-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 16,  2008 the [[European Commission]] presented this legislation. This proposal suggests plans on how to not only reduce the environmental impacts of goods and services, but also encourages the use of more sustainable goods and production technologies. This action plan also encourages the European Union to seek out every opportunity to innovate in industry.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/escp_en.htm |title=European Commission - Environment - Sustainable Development |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[Integrated Product Policy]] is another legislative action that Europe has taken in order to facilitate life cycle thinking. The Integrated Product Policy seeks to minimize the environmental degradation caused from the manufacturing, use and disposal of all products. This legislation looks at all aspects of the product’s life cycle and takes action where necessary to reduce.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ipp/integratedpp.htm |title=European Commission - Environment - Integrated Product Policy |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Thematic Strategy on Sustainable Use of Natural Resources]] was  implemented on 21 December 2005 to reduce environmental impacts associated with resource use and to do this in a growing economy. The objective can be described as “ensuring that the consumption of resources and their associated impacts do not exceed the carrying capacity of the environment and breaking linkages between economic growth and resource use”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/natres/index.htm |title=European Commission - Environment - Sustainable Development |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States policy ===


While the term "life cycle thinking" is not as prominent in United States policy, there are considerations of the life cycle process throughout governmental policies and programs. There are [[Environmental Product Declarations]] that are used to incorporate life cycle thinking into companies and organizations. They communicate to the consumer the environmental performance of a product or system. These declarations are based on the Life Cycle Assessment and once the assessment is complete a product or system can be certified EPD.&lt;ref name="environmentalproductdeclarations.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentalproductdeclarations.com/ |title=Environmental Product Declaration Home Page |publisher=Environmentalproductdeclarations.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Environmental Protection Agency's program, [[Design for the Environment]]  works with individual industry sectors to compare and improve the performance and human health and environmental risks and costs of existing and alternative products, processes, and practices. DfE partnership projects promote integrating cleaner, cheaper, and smarter solutions into everyday business practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LCA Resources|url=http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/lcaccess/resources.html|work=Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Design for the Environment program is also equipped with a labeling program. They allow safer products to carry these labels and they are an indication to consumers that buying these products will be safer for the environment and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Design for the Environment|url=http://www.epa.gov/dfe/pubs/projects/formulat/label.htm|work=Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Also, the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]] is a piece of legislation that incorporates life cycle thinking. While this exact phrase isn't listed. This act includes sections on advanced biofuels. In Title II of the act, it requires the creation of Biomass-based diesel which is the addition of renewable biofuels to diesel fuel and will reduce emissions by 50% as compared to petroleum biofuel. In Title III improved standards will be implemented. 

[[File:Life Cycle Thinking Product System.jpg|thumb|Life Cycle Thinking Product System]]

== Importance ==

Since life cycle thinking can be involved in the choices of individual consumers, as well as policy makers and businesses, it is very important that people are well informed about the subject and its uses.&lt;ref name="European Commission"&gt;{{cite web|last=European Commission|title=Life Cycle Thinking and Assessment|url=http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index_jrc|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasing awareness of the Life Cycle Analysis technique would allow companies as well as individuals to consider multiple options for a new product.  After consideration of all available options, life cycle thinking would encourage selection of the most sustainable option. If more individuals practiced life cycle thinking when looking for new materials or methods, they would be more aware of how the environmental cost of ownership of products can be influenced by the running costs in energy and consumables.&lt;ref name="Life cycle thinking-Martin Tarr"&gt;{{cite web |author-last=Tarr |author-first=Martin |title=Life cycle thinking |work=Online postgraduate courses for the electronics industry |publisher=[[University of Bolton]] |location=UK |date=2011 |orig-year=2005 |url=http://www.ami.ac.uk/courses/topics/0109_lct/ |access-date=2011-11-18 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112084053/http://www.ami.ac.uk:80/courses/topics/0109_lct/ |archive-date=2014-01-12}} [https://archive.is/DCso]&lt;/ref&gt;

Life cycle thinking can help people find new ways to improve environmental performance, image, and economic benefits.&lt;ref name="European Commission" /&gt; Since the decisions of global businesses and government organizations have such a large impact on the environment, incorporating life cycle thinking into their actions could greatly reduce negative environmental effects and improve sustainability. Many businesses do not always consider their supply chains or the "end-of-life" processes associated with their products; likewise, government actions frequently consider their own country or region and do not take into account the impact that they could have on other regions.&lt;ref name="European Commission" /&gt; 

Not only could life cycle thinking help the environment, it can also save the company more money and improve their reputation. If a company knows where their materials come from as well as where they will end up after they have reached the end of their useful life, economic performance could be further enhanced. Also, since presently so much emphasis is placed on sustainable actions, the more a company shows its concern and respect for the environment, the better its reputation will be.

In a case study on laundry detergents, it was found that washing clothes at lower temperatures resulted in energy savings and improvements in several environmental indicators, like climate change, acidification and photochemical ozone creation. Because the company understood the importance of life cycle thinking, they made the decision to conduct a Life Cycle Analysis to find the benefits of developing a different laundry detergent. Not only did the new detergents reduce environmental impact by decreasing energy consumption, it also benefitted the consumer by reducing electricity bills and helped the company by becoming a leader in the industry.

In [[physics]], the '''Lorentz transformations''' are a one-parameter family of [[Linear transformation|linear]] [[coordinate transformation|transformations]] from a [[coordinate frame]] in space time to another frame that moves at a constant velocity, the parameter, within the former. The transformations are named after the Dutch [[physicist]] [[Hendrik Lorentz]]. The respective inverse transformation is then parametrized by the negative of this velocity.

The most common form of the transformation, parametrized by the real constant &lt;math&gt;v,&lt;/math&gt; representing a velocity confined to the {{mvar|x}}-direction, is expressed as&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Forshaw|Smith|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  t' &amp;= \gamma \left( t - \frac{vx}{c^2} \right)  \\ 
  x' &amp;= \gamma \left( x - v t \right)\\
  y' &amp;= y \\ 
  z' &amp;= z
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|(''t'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} and {{math|(''t''&amp;prime;, ''x''&amp;prime;, ''y''&amp;prime;, ''z''&amp;prime;)}} are the coordinates of an event in two frames, where the primed frame is seen from the unprimed frame as moving with speed {{math|''v''}} along the {{mvar|x}}-axis, {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]], and &lt;math&gt; \gamma = \textstyle\left ( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\right )^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lorentz factor]].

Frames of reference can be divided into two groups: [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial]] (relative motion with constant velocity) and [[Non-inertial reference frame|non-inertial]] (accelerating, moving in curved paths, rotational motion with constant [[angular velocity]], etc.). The term "Lorentz transformations" only refers to transformations between ''inertial'' frames, usually in the context of special relativity. 

In each [[frame of reference|reference frame]], an observer can use a local coordinate system (most exclusively [[Cartesian coordinates]] in this context) to measure lengths, and a clock to measure time intervals. An observer is a real or imaginary entity that can take measurements, say humans, or any other living organism—or even robots and computers. An [[Event (relativity)|event]] is something that happens at a point in space at an instant of time, or more formally a point in [[spacetime]]. The transformations connect the space and time coordinates of an [[Event (relativity)|event]] as measured by an observer in each frame.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;One can imagine that in each inertial frame there are observers positioned throughout space, each endowed with a synchronized clock and at rest in the particular inertial frame. These observers then report to a central office, where a report is collected. When one speaks of a ''particular'' observer, one refers to someone having, at least in principle, a copy of this report. See, e.g., {{harvtxt|Sard|1970}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

They supersede the [[Galilean transformation]] of [[Newtonian physics]], which assumes an absolute space and time (see [[Galilean relativity]]). The Galilean transformation is a good approximation only at relative speeds much smaller than the speed of light. Lorentz transformations have a number of unintuitive features that do not appear in Galilean transformations. For example, they reflect the fact that observers moving at different [[velocity|velocities]] may measure different [[Length contraction|distances]], [[time dilation|elapsed times]], and even different [[Relativity of simultaneity|orderings of events]], but always such that the [[speed of light]] is the same in all inertial reference frames. The invariance of light speed is one of the [[postulates of special relativity]].

Historically, the transformations were the result of attempts by Lorentz and others to explain how the speed of [[light]] was observed to be independent of the [[frame of reference|reference frame]], and to understand the symmetries of the laws of [[electromagnetism]]. The Lorentz transformation is in accordance with [[special relativity]], but was derived before special relativity.

The Lorentz transformation is a [[linear transformation]]. It may include a rotation of space; a rotation-free Lorentz transformation is called a '''Lorentz boost'''. In [[Minkowski space]], the mathematical model of spacetime in special relativity, the Lorentz transformations preserve the [[spacetime interval]] between any two events. This property is the defining property of a Lorentz transformation. They describe only the transformations in which the spacetime event at the origin is left fixed. They can be considered as a [[hyperbolic rotation]] of Minkowski space. The more general set of transformations that also includes translations is known as the [[Poincaré group]].

FitzGerald then conjectured that Heaviside’s distortion result might be applied to a theory of intermolecular forces. Some months later, FitzGerald published the conjecture that bodies in motion are being contracted, in order to explain the baffling outcome of the 1887 aether-wind experiment of [[Michelson–Morley experiment|Michelson and Morley]]. In 1892, Lorentz independently presented the same idea in a more detailed manner, which was subsequently called [[Length contraction|FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their explanation was widely known before 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rothman|2006|pages = 112f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorentz (1892–1904) and Larmor (1897–1900), who believed the [[luminiferous aether]] hypothesis, also looked for the transformation under which [[Maxwell's equations]] are invariant when transformed from the aether to a moving frame. They extended the [[Fitzgerald–Lorentz contraction|FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction]] hypothesis and found out that the time coordinate has to be modified as well ("[[relativity of simultaneity|local time]]"). [[Henri Poincaré]] gave a physical interpretation to local time (to first order in ''v''/''c'', the relative velocity of the two reference frames normalized to the speed of light) as the consequence of clock synchronization, under the assumption that the speed of light is constant in moving frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darrigol|2005|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larmor is credited to have been the first to understand the crucial [[time dilation]] property inherent in his equations.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Macrossan|1986|pages=232–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, Poincaré was the first to recognize that the transformation has the properties of a [[group (mathematics)|mathematical group]],
and named it after Lorentz.&lt;ref&gt;The reference is within the following paper:{{harvnb|Poincaré|1905|pages = 1504–1508}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Later in the same year [[Albert Einstein]] published what is now called [[special relativity]], by deriving the Lorentz transformation under the assumptions of the [[principle of relativity]] and the constancy of the speed of light in any [[inertial reference frame]], and by abandoning the mechanistic aether as unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Einstein|1905|pages=891–921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivation of the group of Lorentz transformations ==
{{Main|Derivations of the Lorentz transformations|Lorentz group}}

An ''[[Event (relativity)|event]]'' is something that happens at a certain point in spacetime, or more generally, the point in spacetime itself. In any inertial frame an event is specified by a time coordinate ''ct'' and a set of [[Cartesian coordinate]]s {{math|''x'', ''y'', ''z''}} to specify position in space in that frame. Subscripts label individual events.

From Einstein's [[Postulates of special relativity|second postulate of relativity]] follows

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;c^2(t_2 - t_1)^2 - (x_2 - x_1)^2 - (y_2 - y_1)^2 - (z_2 - z_1)^2 = 0 \quad \text{(lightlike separated events 1, 2)}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|D1}}}}

in all inertial frames for events connected by ''light signals''. The quantity on the left is called the ''spacetime interval'' between events {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} (''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. The interval between ''any two'' events, not necessarily separated by light signals, is in fact invariant, i.e., independent of the state of relative motion of observers in different inertial frames, as is [[Derivations of the Lorentz transformations#Invariance of interval|shown using homogeneity and isotropy of space]]. The transformation sought after thus must possess the property that

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
&amp; c^2(t_2 - t_1)^2 - (x_2 - x_1)^2 - (y_2 - y_1)^2 - (z_2 - z_1)^2 \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; c^2(t_2' - t_1')^2 - (x_2' - x_1')^2 - (y_2' - y_1')^2 - (z_2' - z_1')^2  \quad \text{(all events 1, 2)}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|D2}}}}

where {{math|(''ct'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} are the spacetime coordinates used to define events in one frame, and {{math|(''ct''&amp;prime;, ''x''&amp;prime;, ''y''&amp;prime;, ''z''&amp;prime;)}} are the coordinates in another frame. First one observes that {{EquationNote|(D2)}} is satisfied if an arbitrary {{math|4}}-tuple {{math|''b''}} of numbers are added to events {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Such transformations are called ''spacetime translations'' and are not dealt with further here. Then one observes that a ''linear'' solution preserving the origin of the simpler problem

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; c^2t^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2 = c^2t'^2 - x'^2 - y'^2 - z'^2 \\[6pt]
\text{or} \quad &amp; c^2t_1t_2 - x_1x_2 - y_1y_2 - z_1z_2 = c^2t'_1t'_2 - x'_1x'_2 - y'_1y'_2 - z'_1z'_2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|D3}}}}

solves the general problem too. (A solution satisfying the left formula automatically satisfies the right formula, see [[polarization identity]].) Finding the solution to the simpler problem is just a matter of look-up in the theory of [[classical group]]s that preserve [[bilinear form]]s of various signature.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;It should be noted that the separate requirements of the three equations lead to three different groups. The second equation is satisfied for spacetime translations in addition to Lorentz transformations leading to the [[Poincaré group]] or the ''inhomogeneous Lorentz group''. The first equation (or the second restricted to lightlike separation) leads to a yet larger group, the [[conformal group]] of spacetime.&lt;/ref&gt; Equation {{EquationNote|(D3)}} can be written more compactly as

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;(a, a) = (a', a') \quad \text{or} \quad a \cdot a = a' \cdot a',&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|D4}}}}

where {{math|(·, ·)}} refers to the bilinear form of [[Signature (quadratic form)|signature]] {{math|(1, 3)}} on {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} exposed by the right hand side formula in {{EquationNote|(D3)}}. The alternative notation defined on the right is referred to as the ''relativistic dot product''. Spacetime mathematically viewed as {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} endowed with this bilinear form is known as [[Minkowski space]] {{math|''M''}}. The Lorentz transformation is thus an element of the group Lorentz group {{math|O(1, 3)}}, the [[Lorentz group]] or, for those that prefer the other [[metric signature]], {{math|O(3, 1)}} (also called the Lorentz group).&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The groups {{math|O(3, 1)}} and {{math|O(1, 3)}} are isomorphic. It is widely believed that the choice between the two metric signatures has no physical relevance, even though some objects related to {{math|O(3, 1)}} and {{math|O(1, 3)}} respectively, e.g., the [[Clifford algebra]]s corresponding to the different signatures of the bilinear form associated to the two groups, are non-isomorphic.&lt;/ref&gt; One has

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;(a, a) = (\Lambda a,\Lambda a) = (a', a'), \quad \Lambda \in \mathrm O(1, 3), \quad a, a' \in M,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|D5}}}}

which is precisely preservation of the bilinear form {{EquationNote|(D3)}} which implies (by linearity of {{math|Λ}} and bilinearity of the form) that {{EquationNote|(D2)}} is satisfied. The elements of the Lorentz group are [[Rotation group SO(3)|rotations]] and ''boosts'' and mixes thereof. If the spacetime translations are included, then one obtains the ''inhomogeneous Lorentz group'' or the [[Poincaré group]].

==Generalities==
The relations between the primed and unprimed spacetime coordinates are the '''Lorentz transformations''', each coordinate in one frame is a [[linear function]] of all the coordinates in the other frame, and the [[inverse function]]s are the inverse transformation. Depending on how the frames move relative to each other, and how they are oriented in space relative to each other, other parameters that describe direction, speed, and orientation enter the transformation equations.

{{anchor|boost}}Transformations describing relative motion with constant (uniform) velocity and without rotation of the space coordinate axes are called ''boosts'', and the relative velocity between the frames is the parameter of the transformation. The other basic type of Lorentz transformations is rotations in the spatial coordinates only, these are also inertial frames since there is no relative motion, the frames are simply tilted (and not continuously rotating), and in this case quantities defining the rotation are the parameters of the transformation (e.g., [[axis–angle representation]], or [[Euler angle]]s, etc.). A combination of a rotation and boost is a ''homogeneous transformation'', which transforms the origin back to the origin.

The full Lorentz group {{math|O(3, 1)}} also contains special transformations that are neither rotations nor boosts, but rather [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflections]] in a plane through the origin. Two of these can be singled out; [[P-symmetry|spatial inversion]] in which the spatial coordinates of all events are reversed in sign and [[T-symmetry|temporal inversion]] in which the time coordinate for each event gets its sign reversed.

Boosts should not be conflated with mere displacements in spacetime; in this case, the coordinate systems are simply shifted and there is no relative motion. However, these also count as symmetries forced by special relativity since they leave the spacetime interval invariant. A combination of a rotation with a boost, followed by a shift in spacetime, is an ''inhomogeneous Lorentz transformation'', an element of the Poincaré group, which is also called the inhomogeneous Lorentz group.

A "stationary" observer in frame {{math|''F''}} defines events with coordinates {{math|''t'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z''}}. Another frame {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} moves with velocity {{math|''v''}} relative to {{math|''F''}}, and an observer in this "moving" frame {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} defines events using the coordinates {{math|''t''&amp;prime;, ''x''&amp;prime;, ''y''&amp;prime;, ''z''&amp;prime;}}.

The coordinate axes in each frame are parallel (the {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''x''&amp;prime;}} axes are parallel, the {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''y''&amp;prime;}} axes are parallel, and the {{math|''z''}} and {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}} axes are parallel), remain mutually perpendicular, and relative motion is along the coincident {{math|''xx&amp;prime;''}} axes. At {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''t''&amp;prime; {{=}} 0}}, the origins of both coordinate systems are the same, {{math|(''x, y, z'') {{=}} (''x''&amp;prime;, ''y''&amp;prime;, ''z''&amp;prime;) {{=}} (0, 0, 0)}}. In other words, the times and positions are coincident at this event. If all these hold, then the coordinate systems are said to be in '''standard configuration''', or '''synchronized'''.

If an observer in {{math|''F''}} records an event {{math|''t, x, y, z''}}, then an observer in {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} records the ''same'' event with coordinates&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Forshaw|Smith|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where {{math|''v''}} is the relative velocity between frames in the {{math|''x''}}-direction, {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]], and

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac{1}{ \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

(lowercase [[gamma]]) is the [[Lorentz factor]].

Here, {{math|''v''}} is the ''[[parameter]]'' of the transformation, for a given boost it is a constant number, but can take a continuous range of values. In the setup used here, positive relative velocity {{math|''v'' &gt; 0}} is motion along the positive directions of the {{math|''xx''&amp;prime;}} axes, zero relative velocity {{math|''v'' {{=}} 0}} is no relative motion, while negative relative velocity {{math|''v'' &lt; 0}} is relative motion along the negative directions of the {{math|''xx''&amp;prime;}} axes. The magnitude of relative velocity {{math|''v''}} cannot equal or exceed {{math|''c''}}, so only subluminal speeds {{math|−''c'' &lt; ''v'' &lt; ''c''}} are allowed. The corresponding range of {{math|''γ''}} is {{math|1 ≤ ''γ'' &lt; ∞}}.

The transformations are not defined if {{math|''v''}} is outside these limits. At the speed of light ({{math|''v'' {{=}} ''c''}}) {{math|''γ''}} is infinite, and [[faster than light]] ({{math|''v'' &gt; ''c''}}) {{math|''γ''}} is a [[complex number]], each of which make the transformations unphysical. The space and time coordinates are measurable quantities and numerically must be real numbers.

As an [[active transformation]], an observer in F&amp;prime; notices the coordinates of the event to be "boosted" in the negative directions of the {{math|''xx''&amp;prime;}} axes, because of the {{math|−''v''}} in the transformations. This has the equivalent effect of the ''coordinate system'' F&amp;prime; boosted in the positive directions of the {{math|''xx''&amp;prime;}} axes, while the event does not change and is simply represented in another coordinate system, a [[passive transformation]].

The inverse relations ({{math|''t'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z''}} in terms of {{math|''t''&amp;prime;, ''x''&amp;prime;, ''y''&amp;prime;, ''z''&amp;prime;}}) can be found by algebraically solving the original set of equations. A more efficient way is to use physical principles. Here {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} is the "stationary" frame while {{math|''F''}} is the "moving" frame. According to the principle of relativity, there is no privileged frame of reference, so the transformations from {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} to {{math|''F''}} must take exactly the same form as the transformations from {{math|''F''}} to {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}}. The only difference is {{math|''F''}} moves with velocity {{math|−''v''}} relative to {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} (i.e., the relative velocity has the same magnitude but is oppositely directed). Thus if an observer in {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} notes an event {{math|''t''&amp;prime;, ''x''&amp;prime;, ''y''&amp;prime;, ''z''&amp;prime;}}, then an observer in {{math|''F''}} notes the ''same'' event with coordinates

  y &amp;= y' \\ 
  z &amp;= z',
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and the value of {{math|''γ''}} remains unchanged. This "trick" of simply reversing the direction of relative velocity while preserving its magnitude, and exchanging primed and unprimed variables, always applies to finding the inverse transformation of every boost in any direction.

Sometimes it is more convenient to use {{math|''β'' {{=}} ''v''/''c''}} (lowercase [[beta]]) instead of {{math|''v''}}, so that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  ct' &amp;= \gamma \left( ct - \beta x \right) \,, \\ 
   x' &amp;= \gamma \left( x - \beta ct \right) \,, \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which shows much more clearly the symmetry in the transformation. From the allowed ranges of {{math|''v''}} and the definition of {{math|''β''}}, it follows {{math|−1 &lt; ''β'' &lt; 1}}. The use of {{math|''β''}} and {{math|''γ''}} is standard throughout the literature.

The Lorentz transformations can also be derived in a way that resembles circular rotations in 3d space using the [[hyperbolic function]]s. For the boost in the {{math|''x''}} direction, the results are

{{Equation box 1
|title='''Lorentz boost''' ({{math|''x''}} ''direction with rapidity'' {{math|''ζ''}})
|indent =:
|equation = 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  ct' &amp;=  ct \cosh\zeta - x \sinh\zeta \\

   y' &amp;= y \\ 
   z' &amp;= z
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border = 1
|border colour = black
|background colour=white}}

where {{math|''ζ''}} (lowercase [[zeta]]) is a parameter called ''[[rapidity]]'' (many other symbols are used, including {{math|''θ, ϕ, φ, η, ψ, ξ''}}). Given the strong resemblance to rotations of spatial coordinates in 3d space in the Cartesian xy, yz, and zx planes, a Lorentz boost can be thought of as a [[hyperbolic rotation]] of spacetime coordinates in the xt, yt, and zt Cartesian-time planes of 4d [[Minkowski space]]. The parameter {{math|''ζ''}} is the [[hyperbolic angle]] of rotation, analogous to the ordinary angle for circular rotations. This transformation can be illustrated with a [[Minkowski diagram]].

The hyperbolic functions arise from the ''difference'' between the squares of the time and spatial coordinates in the spacetime interval, rather than a sum. The geometric significance of the hyperbolic functions can be visualized by taking {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} or {{math|''ct'' {{=}} 0}} in the transformations. Squaring and subtracting the results, one can derive hyperbolic curves of constant coordinate values but varying {{math|''ζ''}}, which parametrizes the curves according to the identity

:&lt;math&gt; \cosh^2\zeta - \sinh^2\zeta = 1 \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Conversely the {{math|''ct''}} and {{math|''x''}} axes can be constructed for varying coordinates but constant {{math|''ζ''}}. The definition

:&lt;math&gt; \tanh\zeta = \frac{\sinh\zeta}{\cosh\zeta} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

provides the link between a constant value of rapidity, and the [[slope]] of the {{math|''ct''}} axis in spacetime. A consequence these two hyperbolic formulae is an identity that matches the Lorentz factor

:&lt;math&gt; \cosh\zeta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \tanh^2\zeta}} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Comparing the Lorentz transformations in terms of the relative velocity and rapidity, or using the above formulae, the connections between {{math|''β''}}, {{math|''γ''}}, and {{math|''ζ''}} are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
         \beta &amp;= \tanh\zeta  \,, \\
        \gamma &amp;= \cosh\zeta  \,, \\
  \beta \gamma &amp;= \sinh\zeta  \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the inverse hyperbolic tangent gives the rapidity

:&lt;math&gt; \zeta = \tanh^{-1}\beta  \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{math|−1 &lt; ''β'' &lt; 1}}, it follows {{math|−∞ &lt; ''ζ'' &lt; ∞}}. From the relation between {{math|''ζ''}} and {{math|''β''}}, positive rapidity {{math|''ζ'' &gt; 0}} is motion along the positive directions of the {{math|''xx''&amp;prime;}} axes, zero rapidity {{math|''ζ'' {{=}} 0}} is no relative motion, while negative rapidity {{math|''ζ'' &lt; 0}} is relative motion along the negative directions of the {{math|''xx''&amp;prime;}} axes.

The inverse transformations are obtained by exchanging primed and unprimed quantities to switch the coordinate frames, and negating rapidity {{math|''ζ'' → −''ζ''}} since this is equivalent to negating the relative velocity. Therefore,

{{Equation box 1
|title='''Inverse Lorentz boost''' ({{math|''x''}} ''direction with rapidity'' {{math|''ζ''}})
|indent =:
|equation = 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

   y &amp;= y' \\ 
   z &amp;= z'
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border = 1

The inverse transformations can be similarly visualized by considering the cases when {{math|''x''&amp;prime; {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''ct''&amp;prime; {{=}} 0}}.

So far the Lorentz transformations have been applied to ''one event''. If there are two events, there is a spatial separation and time interval between them. It follows from the [[linear transformation|linearity]] of the Lorentz transformations that two values of space and time coordinates can be chosen, the Lorentz transformations can be applied to each, then subtracted to get the Lorentz transformations of the differences;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \Delta t' &amp;= \gamma \left( \Delta t - \frac{v \, \Delta x}{c^2} \right) \,, \\
  \Delta x' &amp;= \gamma \left( \Delta x - v \, \Delta t \right) \,,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

with inverse relations

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \Delta t &amp;= \gamma \left( \Delta t' + \frac{v \, \Delta x'}{c^2} \right) \,, \\
  \Delta x &amp;= \gamma \left( \Delta x' + v \, \Delta t' \right) \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|Δ}} (uppercase [[delta (letter)|delta]]) indicates a difference of quantities; e.g., {{math|Δ''x'' {{=}} ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} for two values of {{math|''x''}} coordinates, and so on.

These transformations on ''differences'' rather than spatial points or instants of time are useful for a number of reasons:

*in calculations and experiments, it is lengths between two points or time intervals that are measured or of interest (e.g., the length of a moving vehicle, or time duration it takes to travel from one place to another),
*the transformations of velocity can be readily derived by making the difference infinitesimally small and dividing the equations, and the process repeated for the transformation of acceleration,
*if the coordinate systems are never coincident (i.e., not in standard configuration), and if both observers can agree on an event {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} in {{math|''F''}} and {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;}} in {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}}, then they can use that event as the origin, and the spacetime coordinate differences are the differences between their coordinates and this origin, e.g., {{math|Δ''x'' {{=}} ''x'' − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|Δ''x''&amp;prime; {{=}} ''x''&amp;prime; − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;}}, etc.

===Physical implications===

A critical requirement of the Lorentz transformations is the invariance of the speed of light, a fact used in their derivation, and contained in the transformations themselves. If in {{math|''F''}} the equation for a pulse of light along the {{math|''x''}} direction is {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''ct''}}, then in {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} the Lorentz transformations give {{math|''x''&amp;prime; {{=}} ''ct''&amp;prime;}}, and vice versa, for any {{math|−''c'' &lt; ''v'' &lt; ''c''}}.

For relative speeds much less than the speed of light, the Lorentz transformations reduce to the [[Galilean transformation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  t' &amp;\approx t \\
  x' &amp;\approx x - vt
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

in accordance with the [[correspondence principle]]. It is sometimes said that nonrelativistic physics is a physics of "instantaneous action at a distance".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Einstein|1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three unintuitive, but correct, predictions of the transformations are:
;[[Relativity of simultaneity]]: Suppose two events occur simultaneously ({{math|Δ''t'' {{=}} 0}}) along the x axis, but separated by a nonzero displacement {{math|Δ''x''}}.  Then in {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}}, we find that &lt;math&gt;\Delta t' = \gamma \frac{-v\,\Delta x}{c^2} &lt;/math&gt;, so the events are no longer simultaneous according to a moving observer.  
;[[Time dilation]]: Suppose there is a clock at rest in {{math|''F''}}. If a time interval is measured at the same point in that frame, so that {{math|Δ''x'' {{=}} 0}}, then the transformations give this interval in {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} by {{math|Δ''t''&amp;prime; {{=}} ''γ''Δ''t''}}. Conversely, suppose there is a clock at rest in {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}}. If an interval is measured at the same point in that frame, so that {{math|Δ''x''&amp;prime; {{=}} 0}}, then the transformations give this interval in F by {{math|Δ''t'' {{=}} ''γ''Δ''t''&amp;prime;}}. Either way, each observer measures the time interval between ticks of a moving clock to be longer by a factor {{math|''γ''}} than the time interval between ticks of his own clock.
;[[Length contraction]]: Suppose there is a rod at rest in {{math|''F''}} aligned along the x axis, with length {{math|Δ''x''}}.  In {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}}, the rod moves with velocity {{math|-''v''}}, so its length must be measured by taking two simultaneous ({{math|Δ''t''&amp;prime; {{=}} 0}}) measurements at opposite ends.  Under these conditions, the inverse Lorentz transform shows that {{math|Δ''x'' {{=}} ''γ''Δ''x''&amp;prime;}}. In {{math|''F''}} the two measurements are no longer simultaneous, but this does not matter because the rod is at rest in {{math|''F''}}. So each observer measures the distance between the end points of a moving rod to be shorter by a factor {{math|1/''γ''}} than the end points of an identical rod at rest in his own frame. Length contraction affects any geometric quantity related to lengths, so from the perspective of a moving observer, areas and volumes will also appear to shrink along the direction of motion.

===Vector transformations===

{{further|Euclidean vector|vector projection}}

[[File:Lorentz boost any direction standard configuration.svg|300px|thumb|An observer in frame {{math|''F''}} observes {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} to move with velocity {{math|'''v'''}}, while {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} observes {{math|''F''}} to move with velocity {{math|−'''v'''}}. The coordinate axes of each frame are still parallel and orthogonal. The position vector as measured in each frame is split into components parallel and perpendicular to the relative velocity vector {{math|'''v'''}}. '''Left:''' Standard configuration. '''Right:''' Inverse configuration.]]

The use of vectors allows positions and velocities to be expressed in arbitrary directions compactly. A single boost in any direction depends on the full relative [[velocity vector]] {{math|'''v'''}} with a magnitude {{math|{{abs|'''v'''}} {{=}} ''v''}} that cannot equal or exceed {{math|''c''}}, so that {{math|0 ≤ ''v'' &lt; ''c''}}.

Only time and the coordinates parallel to the direction of relative motion change, while those coordinates perpendicular do not. With this in mind, split the spatial [[position vector]] {{math|'''r'''}} as measured in {{math|''F''}}, and {{math|'''r'''&amp;prime;}} as measured in {{math|''F&amp;prime;''}}, each into components perpendicular (⊥) and parallel ( &amp;#8214; ) to {{math|'''v'''}},

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{r}_\perp+\mathbf{r}_\|\,,\quad \mathbf{r}' = \mathbf{r}_\perp' + \mathbf{r}_\|' \,, &lt;/math&gt;

then the transformations are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                t'  &amp;= \gamma \left(t - \frac{\mathbf{r}_\parallel \cdot \mathbf{v}}{c^2} \right) \\
     \mathbf{r}_\|' &amp;= \gamma (\mathbf{r}_\| - \mathbf{v} t) \\
  \mathbf{r}_\perp' &amp;= \mathbf{r}_\perp
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where · is the [[dot product]]. The Lorentz factor {{math|''γ''}} retains its definition for a boost in any direction, since it depends only on the magnitude of the relative velocity. The definition {{math|'''β''' {{=}} '''v'''/''c''}} with magnitude {{math|0 ≤ ''β'' &lt; 1}} is also used by some authors.

Introducing a [[unit vector]] {{math|'''n''' {{=}} '''v'''/''v'' {{=}} '''β'''/''β''}} in the direction of relative motion, the relative velocity is {{math|'''v''' {{=}} ''v'''''n'''}} with magnitude {{math|''v''}} and direction {{math|'''n'''}}, and [[vector projection]] and rejection give respectively

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_\parallel = (\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{n})\mathbf{n}\,,\quad \mathbf{r}_\perp = \mathbf{r} - (\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{n})\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;

Accumulating the results gives the full transformations,

{{Equation box 1
|title='''Lorentz boost''' (''in direction'' {{math|'''n'''}} ''with magnitude'' {{math|''v''}}) 
|indent =:
|equation = 
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

  \mathbf{r}' &amp;= \mathbf{r} + (\gamma-1)(\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{n})\mathbf{n} - \gamma t v\mathbf{n} \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border = 1
|border colour = black
|background colour=white}}

The projection and rejection also applies to {{math|'''r'''&amp;prime;}}. For the inverse transformations, exchange {{math|'''r'''}} and {{math|'''r'''&amp;prime;}} to switch observed coordinates, and negate the relative velocity {{math|'''v''' → −'''v'''}} (or simply the unit vector {{math|'''n''' → −'''n'''}} since the magnitude {{math|''v''}} is always positive) to obtain

{{Equation box 1

|indent =:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

  \mathbf{r} &amp;= \mathbf{r}' + (\gamma-1)(\mathbf{r}'\cdot\mathbf{n})\mathbf{n} + \gamma t' v\mathbf{n} \,,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border = 1
|border colour = black
|background colour=white}}

The unit vector has the advantage of simplifying equations for a single boost, allows either {{math|'''v'''}} or {{math|'''β'''}} to be reinstated when convenient, and the rapidity parametrization is immediately obtained by replacing {{math|''β''}} and {{math|''βγ''}}. It is not convenient for multiple boosts.

The vectorial relation between relative velocity and rapidity is&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barut|1964|page=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\beta} = \beta \mathbf{n} = \mathbf{n} \tanh\zeta \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and the "rapidity vector" can be defined as

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\zeta} = \zeta\mathbf{n} = \mathbf{n}\tanh^{-1}\beta \,, &lt;/math&gt;

each of which serves as a useful abbreviation in some contexts. The magnitude of {{math|'''ζ'''}} is the absolute value of the rapidity scalar confined to {{math|0 ≤ ''ζ'' &lt; ∞}}, which agrees with the range {{math|0 ≤ ''β'' &lt; 1}}.

===Transformation of velocities===

{{further|differential of a function|velocity addition formula}}

[[File:Lorentz transformation of velocity including velocity addition.svg|300px|thumb|The transformation of velocities provides the definition [[velocity addition formula|relativistic velocity addition]] {{math|&amp;oplus;}}, the ordering of vectors is chosen to reflect the ordering of the addition of velocities; first {{math|'''v'''}} (the velocity of F&amp;prime; relative to F) then {{math|'''u'''&amp;prime;}} (the velocity of X relative to F&amp;prime;) to obtain {{math|'''u''' {{=}} '''v''' &amp;oplus; '''u'''&amp;prime;}} (the velocity of X relative to F).]]

Defining the coordinate velocities and Lorentz factor by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} = \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \,,\quad \mathbf{u}' = \frac{d\mathbf{r}'}{dt'} \,,\quad \gamma_\mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\dfrac{\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{v}}{c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

taking the differentials in the coordinates and time of the vector transformations, then dividing equations, leads to

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}' = \frac{1}{ 1 - \frac{\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{u}}{c^2} }\left[\frac{\mathbf{u}}{\gamma_\mathbf{v}} - \mathbf{v} + \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\gamma_\mathbf{v}}{\gamma_\mathbf{v} + 1}\left(\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}\right)\mathbf{v}\right] &lt;/math&gt;

The velocities {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''u'''&amp;prime;}} are the velocity of some massive object. They can also be for a third inertial frame (say ''F''&amp;prime;&amp;prime;), in which case they must be ''constant''. Denote either entity by X. Then X moves with velocity {{math|'''u'''}} relative to F, or equivalently with velocity {{math|'''u'''&amp;prime;}} relative to F&amp;prime;, in turn F&amp;prime; moves with velocity {{math|'''v'''}} relative to F. The inverse transformations can be obtained in a similar way, or as with position coordinates exchange {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''u'''&amp;prime;}}, and change {{math|'''v'''}} to {{math|−'''v'''}}.

The transformation of velocity is useful in [[stellar aberration]], the [[Fizeau experiment]], and the [[relativistic Doppler effect]].

The [[Acceleration (special relativity)#Three-acceleration|Lorentz transformations of acceleration]] can be similarly obtained by taking differentials in the velocity vectors, and dividing these by the time differential.

===Transformation of other quantities===

In general, given four quantities {{math|''A''}} and {{math|'''Z''' {{=}} (''Z''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and their Lorentz-boosted counterparts {{math|''A''&amp;prime;}} and {{math|'''Z'''&amp;prime; {{=}} (''Z''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Z''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Z''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, a relation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;A^2 - \mathbf{Z}\cdot\mathbf{Z} = {A'}^2 - \mathbf{Z}'\cdot\mathbf{Z}'&lt;/math&gt;

implies the quantities transform under Lorentz transformations similar to the transformation of spacetime coordinates;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
           A' &amp;= \gamma \left(A - \frac{v\mathbf{n}\cdot \mathbf{Z}}{c} \right) \,, \\
  \mathbf{Z}' &amp;= \mathbf{Z} + (\gamma-1)(\mathbf{Z}\cdot\mathbf{n})\mathbf{n} - \frac{\gamma A v\mathbf{n}}{c} \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The decomposition of {{math|'''Z'''}} (and {{math|'''Z'''′}}) into components perpendicular and parallel to {{math|'''v'''}} is exactly the same as for the position vector, as is the process of obtaining the inverse transformations (exchange {{math|(''A'', '''Z''')}} and {{math|(''A''&amp;prime;, '''Z'''&amp;prime;)}} to switch observed quantities, and reverse the direction of relative motion by the substitution {{math|'''n''' ↦ −'''n'''}}).

The quantities {{math|(''A'', '''Z''')}} collectively make up a ''[[four vector]]'', where {{math|''A''}} is the "timelike component", and {{math|'''Z'''}} the "spacelike component". Examples of {{math|''A''}} and {{math|'''Z'''}} are the following:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Four vector
! {{math|''A''}}
! {{math|'''Z'''}}
|-

| [[Time]] (multiplied by {{math|''c''}}), {{math|''ct''}}
| [[Position vector]], {{math|'''r'''}}
|-

|-
| [[Electromagnetic four potential]]
| [[Electric potential]] (divided by {{math|''c''}}), {{math|''φ''/''c''}}
| [[Magnetic potential]], {{math|'''A'''}}
|}

For a given object (e.g., particle, fluid, field, material), if {{math|''A''}} or {{math|'''Z'''}} correspond to properties specific to the object like its [[charge density]], [[mass density]], [[spin (physics)|spin]], etc., its properties can be fixed in the rest frame of that object. Then the Lorentz transformations give the corresponding properties in a frame moving relative to the object with constant velocity. This breaks some notions taken for granted in non-relativistic physics. For example, the energy {{math|''E''}} of an object is a scalar in non-relativistic mechanics, but not in relativistic mechanics because energy changes under Lorentz transformations; its value is different for various inertial frames. In the rest frame of an object, it has a [[rest energy]] and zero momentum. In a boosted frame its energy is different and it appears to have a momentum. Similarly, in non-relativistic quantum mechanics the spin of a particle is a constant vector, but in [[relativistic quantum mechanics]] spin {{math|'''s'''}} depends on relative motion. In the rest frame of the particle, the spin pseudovector can be fixed to be its ordinary non-relativistic spin with a zero timelike quantity {{math|''s&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, however a boosted observer will perceive a nonzero timelike component and an altered spin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaichian|Hagedorn|1997|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all quantities are invariant in the form as shown above, for example orbital [[angular momentum]] {{math|'''L'''}} does not have a timelike quantity, and neither does the [[electric field]] {{math|'''E'''}} nor the [[magnetic field]] {{math|'''B'''}}. The definition of angular momentum is {{math|'''L''' {{=}} '''r''' × '''p'''}}, and in a boosted frame the altered angular momentum is {{math|'''L'''&amp;prime; {{=}} '''r'''&amp;prime; × '''p'''&amp;prime;}}. Applying this definition using the transformations of coordinates and momentum leads to the transformation of angular momentum. It turns out {{math|'''L'''}} transforms with another vector quantity {{math|'''N''' {{=}} (''E''/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)'''r''' − ''t'''''p'''}} related to boosts, see [[relativistic angular momentum]] for details. For the case of the {{math|'''E'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} fields, the transformations cannot be obtained as directly using vector algebra. The [[Lorentz force]] is the definition of these fields, and in {{math|''F''}} it is {{math|'''F''' {{=}} ''q''('''E''' + '''v''' × '''B''')}} while in {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} it is {{math|'''F'''&amp;prime; {{=}} ''q''('''E'''&amp;prime; + '''v'''&amp;prime; × '''B'''&amp;prime;)}}. A method of deriving the EM field transformations in an efficient way which also illustrates the unit of the electromagnetic field uses tensor algebra, [[Lorentz transformation#Transformation of the electromagnetic field|given below]].

Throughout, italic non-bold capital letters are 4×4 matrices, while non-italic bold letters are 3×3 matrices.

===Homogeneous Lorentz group===

Writing the coordinates in column vectors and the [[Minkowski metric]] {{math|''η''}} as a square matrix

:&lt;math&gt; X' = \begin{bmatrix} c\,t' \\ x' \\ y' \\ z' \end{bmatrix} \,, \quad \eta = \begin{bmatrix} -1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\ 0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0 \\ 0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0 \\ 0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1 \end{bmatrix} \,, \quad X = \begin{bmatrix} c\,t \\ x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix}  &lt;/math&gt;

the spacetime interval takes the form (T denotes [[transpose]])

:&lt;math&gt; X \cdot X = X^\mathrm{T} \eta X = {X'}^\mathrm{T} \eta {X'} &lt;/math&gt;

and is [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] under a Lorentz transformation

:&lt;math&gt;X' = \Lambda X  &lt;/math&gt;

where Λ is a square matrix which can depend on parameters.

The [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all Lorentz transformations Λ in this article is denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;. This set together with matrix multiplication forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]], in this context known as the ''[[Lorentz group]]''. Also, the above expression {{math|''X·X''}} is a [[quadratic form]] of signature (3,1) on spacetime, and the group of transformations which leaves this quadratic form invariant is the [[indefinite orthogonal group]] O(3,1), a [[Lie group]]. In other words, the Lorentz group is O(3,1). As presented in this article, any Lie groups mentioned are [[matrix Lie group]]s. In this context the operation of composition amounts to [[matrix multiplication]].

From the invariance of the spacetime interval it follows

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \Lambda^\mathrm{T} \eta \Lambda &lt;/math&gt;

and this matrix equation contains the general conditions on the Lorentz transformation to ensure invariance of the spacetime interval. Taking the [[determinant]] of the equation using the product rule&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For two square matrices {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}, {{math|det(''AB'') {{=}} det(''A'')det(''B'')}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives immediately

:&lt;math&gt;[\det (\Lambda)]^2 = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \det(\Lambda) = \pm 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Writing the Minkowski metric as a block matrix, and the Lorentz transformation in the most general form,

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \begin{bmatrix}-1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \mathbf{I}\end{bmatrix} \,, \quad \Lambda=\begin{bmatrix}\Gamma &amp; -\mathbf{a}^\mathrm{T}\\-\mathbf{b} &amp; \mathbf{M}\end{bmatrix}  \,, &lt;/math&gt;

carrying out the block matrix multiplications obtains general conditions on {{math|Γ, '''a''', '''b''', '''M'''}} to ensure relativistic invariance. Not much information can be directly extracted from all the conditions, however one of the results

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^2 = 1 + \mathbf{b}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;

is useful; {{math|'''b'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''b''' ≥ 0}} always so it follows that

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma^2 \geq 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \Gamma \leq - 1 \,,\quad \Gamma \geq  1 &lt;/math&gt;

The negative inequality may be unexpected, because {{math|Γ}} multiplies the time coordinate and this has an effect on [[Time translation symmetry|time symmetry]]. If the positive equality holds, then {{math|Γ}} is the Lorentz factor.

The determinant and inequality provide four ways to classify Lorentz transformations (herein LTs for brevity). Any particular LT has only one determinant sign ''and'' only one inequality. There are four sets which include every possible pair given by the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]]s ("n"-shaped symbol meaning "and") of these classifying sets.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Intersection, ∩
! '''Antichronous''' (or non-orthochronous) LTs

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}^\downarrow = \{ \Lambda  \, : \, \Gamma \leq -1 \} &lt;/math&gt;
! '''Orthochronous''' LTs

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}^\uparrow = \{ \Lambda  \, : \, \Gamma \geq 1 \} &lt;/math&gt;
|-
! '''Proper''' LTs

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}_{+} = \{ \Lambda  \, : \, \det(\Lambda) = +1 \} &lt;/math&gt;

|'''Proper orthochronous''' LTs
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_+^\uparrow = \mathcal{L}_+ \cap \mathcal{L}^\uparrow &lt;/math&gt;
|-
! '''Improper''' LTs

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}_{-} = \{ \Lambda  \, : \, \det(\Lambda) = -1 \} &lt;/math&gt;
|'''Improper antichronous''' LTs
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{-}^\downarrow = \mathcal{L}_{-} \cap \mathcal{L}^\downarrow &lt;/math&gt;
|'''Improper orthochronous''' LTs
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{-}^\uparrow = \mathcal{L}_{-} \cap \mathcal{L}^\uparrow &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

where "+" and "−" indicate the determinant sign, while "↑" for ≥ and "↓" for ≤ denote the inequalities.

The full Lorentz group splits into the [[Union (set theory)|union]] ("u"-shaped symbol meaning "or") of four [[disjoint set]]s

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{+}^\uparrow \cup \mathcal{L}_{-}^\uparrow \cup \mathcal{L}_{+}^\downarrow \cup \mathcal{L}_{-}^\downarrow &lt;/math&gt;

A [[subgroup]] of a group must be [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the same operation of the group (here matrix multiplication). In other words, for two Lorentz transformations {{math|Λ}} and {{math|''L''}} from a particular set, the composite Lorentz transformations {{math|Λ''L''}} and {{math|''L''Λ}} must be in the same set as {{math|Λ}} and {{math|''L''}}. This will not always be the case; it can be shown that the composition of ''any'' two Lorentz transformations always has the positive determinant and positive inequality, a proper orthochronous transformation. The sets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_+^\uparrow &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_+&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^\uparrow&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_0 = \mathcal{L}_+^\uparrow \cup \mathcal{L}_{-}^\downarrow&lt;/math&gt; all form subgroups. The other sets involving the improper and/or antichronous properties (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_+^\downarrow &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{-}^\downarrow &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{-}^\uparrow &lt;/math&gt;) do not form subgroups, because the composite transformation always has a positive determinant or inequality, whereas the original separate transformations will have negative determinants and/or inequalities.

===Proper transformations===

The Lorentz boost is

:&lt;math&gt;X' = B(\mathbf{v})X&lt;/math&gt;

where the boost matrix is

:&lt;math&gt; B(\mathbf{v}) = \begin{bmatrix} \gamma&amp;-\gamma\beta n_x&amp;-\gamma\beta n_y&amp;-\gamma\beta n_z\\ -\gamma\beta n_x&amp;1+(\gamma-1)n_x^2&amp;(\gamma-1)n_x n_y&amp;(\gamma-1)n_x n_z\\ -\gamma\beta n_y&amp;(\gamma-1)n_y n_x&amp;1+(\gamma-1)n_y^2&amp;(\gamma-1)n_y n_z\\ -\gamma\beta n_z&amp;(\gamma-1)n_z n_x&amp;(\gamma-1)n_z n_y&amp;1+(\gamma-1)n_z^2\\ \end{bmatrix} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The boosts along the Cartesian directions can be readily obtained, for example the unit vector in the x direction has components {{math|''n&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''n&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''n&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 0}}.

The matrices make one or more successive transformations easier to handle, rather than rotely iterating the transformations to obtain the result of more than one transformation. If a frame {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}} is boosted with velocity {{math|'''u'''}} relative to frame {{math|''F''}}, and another frame {{math|''F''&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} is boosted with velocity {{math|'''v'''}} relative to {{math|''F''&amp;prime;}}, the separate boosts are
:&lt;math&gt;X'' = B(\mathbf{v})X' \,, \quad X' = B(\mathbf{u})X &lt;/math&gt;
and the composition of the two boosts connects the coordinates in {{math|''F''&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} and {{math|''F''}},
:&lt;math&gt;X'' = B(\mathbf{v})B(\mathbf{u})X \,. &lt;/math&gt;
Successive transformations act on the left. If {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''v'''}} are [[collinear]] (parallel or antiparallel along the same line of relative motion), the boost matrices [[Commutative property|commute]]: {{math|''B''('''v''')''B''('''u''') {{=}} ''B''('''u''')''B''('''v''')}} and this composite transformation happens to be another boost.

If {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''v'''}} are not collinear but in different directions, the situation is considerably more complicated. Lorentz boosts along different directions do not commute: {{math|''B''('''v''')''B''('''u''')}} and {{math|''B''('''u''')''B''('''v''')}} are not equal. Also, each of these compositions is ''not'' a single boost, but still a Lorentz transformation as each boost still preserves invariance of the spacetime interval. It turns out the composition of any two Lorentz boosts is equivalent to a boost followed or preceded by a rotation on the spatial coordinates, in the form of {{math|''R''('''ρ''')''B''('''w''')}} or {{math|''B''({{overline|'''w'''}})''R''({{overline|'''ρ'''}})}}. The {{math|'''w'''}} and {{math|{{overline|'''w'''}}}} are [[velocity addition formula|composite velocities]], while {{math|'''ρ'''}} and {{math|{{overline|'''ρ'''}}}} are rotation parameters (e.g. [[axis-angle representation|axis-angle]] variables, [[Euler angles]], etc.). The rotation in [[block matrix]] form is simply

:&lt;math&gt;\quad R(\boldsymbol{\rho}) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \mathbf{R}(\boldsymbol{\rho}) \end{bmatrix} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''R'''('''ρ''')}} is a 3d [[rotation matrix]], which rotates any 3d vector in one sense (active transformation), or equivalently the coordinate frame in the opposite sense (passive transformation). It is ''not'' simple to connect {{math|'''w'''}} and {{math|'''ρ'''}} (or {{math|{{overline|'''w'''}}}} and {{math|{{overline|'''ρ'''}}}}) to the original boost parameters {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''v'''}}. In a composition of boosts, the {{math|''R''}} matrix is named the [[Wigner rotation]], and gives rise to the [[Thomas precession]]. These articles give the explicit formulae for the composite transformation matrices, including expressions for {{math|'''w''', '''ρ''', {{overline|'''w'''}}, {{overline|'''ρ'''}}}}.

In this article the [[axis-angle representation]] is used for {{math|'''ρ'''}}. The rotation is about an axis in the direction of a [[unit vector]] {{math|'''e'''}}, through angle {{math|''θ''}} (positive anticlockwise, negative clockwise, according to the [[right-hand rule]]). The "axis-angle vector"
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\theta} = \theta \mathbf{e}&lt;/math&gt; 
will serve as a useful abbreviation.

Spatial rotations alone are also Lorentz transformations they leave the spacetime interval invariant. Like boosts, successive rotations about different axes do not commute. Unlike boosts, the composition of any two rotations is equivalent to a single rotation. Some other similarities and differences between the boost and rotation matrices include:

*[[matrix inverse|inverse]]s: {{math|''B''('''v''')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''B''(−'''v''')}} (relative motion in the opposite direction), and {{math|''R''('''θ''')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''R''(−'''θ''')}} (rotation in the opposite sense about the same axis)
*[[identity transformation]] for no relative motion/rotation: {{math|''B''('''0''') {{=}} ''R''('''0''') {{=}} ''I''}}
*unit [[determinant]]: {{math|det(''B'') {{=}} det(''R'') {{=}} +1}}. This property makes them proper transformations.
*[[symmetric matrix|matrix symmetry]]: {{math|''B''}} is symmetric (equals [[transpose]]), while {{math|''R''}} is nonsymmetric but [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal]] (transpose equals [[matrix inverse|inverse]], {{math|''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''R''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}).

The most general proper Lorentz transformation {{math|Λ('''v''', '''θ''')}} includes a boost and rotation together, and is a nonsymmetric matrix. As special cases, {{math|Λ('''0''', '''θ''') {{=}} ''R''('''θ''')}} and {{math|Λ('''v''', '''0''') {{=}} ''B''('''v''')}}. An explicit form of the general Lorentz transformation is cumbersome to write down and will not be given here. Nevertheless, closed form expressions for the transformation matrices will be given below using group theoretical arguments. It will be easier to use the rapidity parametrization for boosts, in which case one writes {{math|Λ('''ζ''', '''θ''')}} and {{math|''B''('''ζ''')}}.

====The Lie group SO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(3,1)====

The set of transformations

:&lt;math&gt; \{ B(\boldsymbol{\zeta}), R(\boldsymbol{\theta}), \Lambda(\boldsymbol{\zeta}, \boldsymbol{\theta}) \} &lt;/math&gt;

with matrix multiplication as the operation of composition forms a group, called the "restricted Lorentz group", and is the [[special indefinite orthogonal group]] SO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(3,1). (The plus sign indicates that it preserves the orientation of the temporal dimension).

For simplicity, look at the infinitesimal Lorentz boost in the x direction (examining a boost in any other direction, or rotation about any axis, follows an identical procedure). The infinitesimal boost is a small boost away from the identity, obtained by the [[Taylor expansion]] of the boost matrix to first order about {{math|''ζ'' {{=}} 0}},

:&lt;math&gt; B_x = I + \zeta \left. \frac{\partial B_x}{\partial \zeta } \right|_{\zeta=0} + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

where the higher order terms not shown are negligible because {{math|''ζ''}} is small, and {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is simply the boost matrix in the ''x'' direction. The [[matrix calculus|derivative of the matrix]] is the matrix of derivatives (of the entries, with respect to the same variable), and it is understood the derivatives are found first then evaluated at {{math|''ζ'' {{=}} 0}},

:&lt;math&gt; \left. \frac{\partial B_x }{\partial \zeta } \right|_{\zeta=0} = - K_x \,. &lt;/math&gt;

For now, {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is defined by this result (its significance will be explained shortly). In the limit of an infinite number of infinitely small steps, the finite boost transformation in the form of a [[matrix exponential]] is obtained

:&lt;math&gt; B_x =\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\left(I-\frac{\zeta }{N}K_x\right)^{N} = e^{-\zeta K_x} &lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Exponential function#Formal definition|limit definition of the exponential]] has been used (see also [[characterizations of the exponential function]]). More generally&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Explicitly,
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\zeta} \cdot\mathbf{K} = \zeta_x K_x + \zeta_y K_y + \zeta_z K_z &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\theta} \cdot\mathbf{J} = \theta_x J_x + \theta_y J_y + \theta_z J_z &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B(\boldsymbol{\zeta}) = e^{-\boldsymbol{\zeta}\cdot\mathbf{K}} \, , \quad R(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = e^{\boldsymbol{\theta}\cdot\mathbf{J}} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The axis-angle vector {{math|'''θ'''}} and rapidity vector {{math|'''ζ'''}} are altogether six continuous variables which make up the group parameters (in this particular representation), and the generators of the group are {{math|'''K''' {{=}} (''K&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, K&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, K&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} and {{math|'''J''' {{=}} (''J&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, each vectors of matrices with the explicit forms&lt;ref group=nb&gt;In [[quantum mechanics]], [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], and [[quantum field theory]], a different convention is used for these matrices; the right hand sides are all multiplied by a factor of the imaginary unit {{math|''i'' {{=}} {{sqrt|−1}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;K_x = \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
  \end{bmatrix}\,,\quad K_y = \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}\,,\quad K_z = \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J_x =  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;  0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;  0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp;  0 \\
  \end{bmatrix}\,,\quad J_y = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}\,,\quad J_z =  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 0 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 1 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp;  0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

These are all defined in an analogous way to {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} above, although the minus signs in the boost generators are conventional. Physically, the generators of the Lorentz group correspond to important symmetries in spacetime: {{math|'''J'''}} are the ''rotation generators'' which correspond to [[angular momentum]], and {{math|'''K'''}} are the ''boost generators'' which correspond to the motion of the system in spacetime. The derivative of any smooth curve {{math|''C''(''t'')}} with {{math|''C''(0) {{=}} ''I''}} in the group depending on some group parameter {{math|''t''}} with respect to that group parameter, evaluated at {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}, serves as a definition of a corresponding group generator {{math|''G''}}, and this reflects an infinitesimal transformation away from the identity. The smooth curve can always be taken as an exponential as the exponential will always map {{math|''G''}} smoothly back into the group via {{math|''t'' → exp(''tG'')}} for all {{math|''t''}}; this curve will yield {{math|''G''}} again when differentiated at {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}.

Expanding the exponentials in their Taylor series obtains

:&lt;math&gt; B({\boldsymbol {\zeta }})=I-\sinh \zeta (\mathbf {n} \cdot \mathbf {K} )+(\cosh \zeta -1)(\mathbf {n} \cdot \mathbf {K} )^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R(\boldsymbol {\theta })=I+\sin \theta (\mathbf {e} \cdot \mathbf {J} )+(1-\cos \theta )(\mathbf {e} \cdot \mathbf {J} )^2\,.&lt;/math&gt;

which compactly reproduce the boost and rotation matrices as given in the previous section.

It has been stated that the general proper Lorentz transformation is a product of a boost and rotation. At the ''infinitesimal'' level the product

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} \Lambda 
 &amp; = (I - \boldsymbol {\zeta } \cdot \mathbf {K} + \cdots )(I + \boldsymbol {\theta } \cdot \mathbf {J} + \cdots ) \\
 &amp; = (I + \boldsymbol {\theta } \cdot \mathbf {J} + \cdots )(I - \boldsymbol {\zeta } \cdot \mathbf {K} + \cdots ) \\
 &amp; = I - \boldsymbol {\zeta } \cdot \mathbf {K}  + \boldsymbol {\theta } \cdot \mathbf {J} + \cdots   
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

is commutative because only linear terms are required (products like {{math|('''θ'''·'''J''')('''ζ'''·'''K''')}} and {{math|('''ζ'''·'''K''')('''θ'''·'''J''')}} count as higher order terms and are negligible). Taking the limit as before leads to the finite transformation in the form of an exponential

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda (\boldsymbol{\zeta}, \boldsymbol{\theta}) = e^{-\boldsymbol{\zeta} \cdot\mathbf{K} + \boldsymbol{\theta} \cdot\mathbf{J} }.&lt;/math&gt;

The converse is also true, but the decomposition of a finite general Lorentz transformation into such factors is nontrivial. In particular,

:&lt;math&gt;e^{-\boldsymbol{\zeta} \cdot\mathbf{K} + \boldsymbol{\theta} \cdot\mathbf{J} } \ne e^{-\boldsymbol{\zeta} \cdot\mathbf{K}} e^{\boldsymbol{\theta} \cdot\mathbf{J}},&lt;/math&gt;

because the generators do not commute. For a description of how to find the factors of a general Lorentz transformation in terms of a boost and a rotation ''in principle'' (this usually does not yield an intelligible expression in terms of generators {{math|'''J'''}} and {{math|'''K'''}}), see [[Wigner rotation]]. If, on the other hand, ''the decomposition is given'' in terms of the generators, and one wants to find the product in terms of the generators, then the [[Baker&amp;ndash;Campbell&amp;ndash;Hausdorff formula]] applies.

====The Lie algebra so(3,1)====

Lorentz generators can be added together, or multiplied by real numbers, to obtain more Lorentz generators. In other words, the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all Lorentz generators

:&lt;math&gt;V = \{ \boldsymbol{\zeta} \cdot\mathbf{K} + \boldsymbol{\theta} \cdot\mathbf{J}  \} &lt;/math&gt;

together with the operations of ordinary [[matrix addition]] and [[matrix multiplication#Scalar multiplication|multiplication of a matrix by a number]], forms a [[vector space]] over the real numbers.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Until now the term "vector" has exclusively referred to "[[Euclidean vector]]", examples are position {{math|'''r'''}}, velocity {{math|'''v'''}}, etc. The term "vector" applies much more broadly than Euclidean vectors, row or column vectors, etc., see [[linear algebra]] and [[vector space]] for details. The generators of a Lie group also form a vector space over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] of numbers (e.g. [[real number]]s, [[complex number]]s), since a [[linear combination]] of the generators is also a generator. They just live in a different space to the position vectors in ordinary 3d space.&lt;/ref&gt; The generators {{math|''J&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;, K&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, K&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, K&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} form a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] set of ''V'', and the components of the axis-angle and rapidity vectors, {{math|''θ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, θ&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, θ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;, ζ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, ζ&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, ζ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, are the [[coordinate vector|coordinate]]s of a Lorentz generator with respect to this basis.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;In ordinary 3d [[position space]], the position vector {{math|'''r''' {{=}} ''x'''''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y'''''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''z'''''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is expressed as a linear combination of the Cartesian unit vectors {{math|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;}} which form a basis, and the Cartesian coordinates {{math|''x, y, z''}} are coordinates with respect to this basis.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the [[commutation relation]]s of the Lorentz generators are

:&lt;math&gt;[ J_x, J_y ] =  J_z \,,\quad [ K_x, K_y ] = -J_z \,,\quad [ J_x, K_y ] =  K_z \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where the bracket {{math|[''A'', ''B''] {{=}} ''AB'' − ''BA''}} is known as the ''[[commutator]]'', and the other relations can be found by taking [[cyclic permutation]]s of x, y, z components (i.e. change x to y, y to z, and z to x, repeat).

These commutation relations, and the vector space of generators, fulfill the definition of the [[Lie algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{so}(3, 1)&lt;/math&gt;. In summary, a Lie algebra is defined as a [[vector space]] ''V'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] of numbers, and with a [[binary operation]] [ , ] (called a [[Lie bracket]] in this context) on the elements of the vector space, satisfying the axioms of [[Bilinear map|bilinearity]], [[alternatization]], and the [[Jacobi identity]]. Here the operation [ , ] is the commutator which satisfies all of these axioms, the vector space is the set of Lorentz generators ''V'' as given previously, and the field is the set of real numbers.

Linking terminology used in mathematics and physics: A group generator is any element of the Lie algebra. A group parameter is a component of a coordinate vector representing an arbitrary element of the Lie algebra with respect to some basis. A basis, then, is a set of generators being a basis of the Lie algebra in the usual vector space sense.

The [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] from the Lie algebra to the Lie group,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{exp} \, : \, \mathfrak{so}(3,1) \rightarrow \mathrm{SO}(3,1),&lt;/math&gt;

provides a one-to-one correspondence between small enough neighborhoods of the origin of the Lie algebra and neighborhoods of the identity element of the Lie group. It the case of the Lorentz group, the exponential map is just the [[matrix exponential]]. Globally, the exponential map is not one-to-one, but in the case of the Lorentz group, it is [[surjective function|surjective]] (onto). Hence any group element can be expressed as an exponential of an element of the Lie algebra.

===Improper transformations===

Lorentz transformations also include [[parity inversion]]

:&lt;math&gt; P = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; - \mathbf{I} \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

which negates all the spatial coordinates only, and [[T-symmetry|time reversal]]

:&lt;math&gt; T = \begin{bmatrix} - 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \mathbf{I} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

which negates the time coordinate only, because these transformations leave the spacetime interval invariant. Here {{math|'''I'''}} is the 3d [[identity matrix]]. These are both symmetric, they are their own inverses (see [[involution (mathematics)]]), and each have determinant −1. This latter property makes them improper transformations.

If {{math|Λ}} is a proper orthochronous Lorentz transformation, then {{math|''T''Λ}} is improper antichronous, {{math|''P''Λ}} is improper orthochronous, and {{math|''TP''Λ {{=}} ''PT''Λ}} is proper antichronous.

=== Inhomogeneous Lorentz group ===

Two other spacetime symmetries have not been accounted for. For the spacetime interval to be invariant, it can be shown&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberg|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it is necessary and sufficient for the coordinate transformation to be of the form

:&lt;math&gt;X' = \Lambda X + C &lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is a constant column containing translations in time and space. If ''C'' ≠ 0, this is an '''inhomogeneous Lorentz transformation''' or '''[[Poincaré transformation]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberg|2005|pages=55–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ohlsson|2011|page=3–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''C'' = 0, this is a '''homogeneous Lorentz transformation'''. Poincaré transformations are not dealt further in this article.

=== Contravariant vectors ===
Writing the general matrix transformation of coordinates as the matrix equation

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
    {x'}^0 \\
    {x'}^1 \\
    {x'}^2 \\
    {x'}^3
  \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    {\Lambda^0}_0 &amp; {\Lambda^0}_1 &amp; {\Lambda^0}_2 &amp; {\Lambda^0}_3 \\
    {\Lambda^1}_0 &amp; {\Lambda^1}_1 &amp; {\Lambda^1}_2 &amp; {\Lambda^1}_3 \\
    {\Lambda^2}_0 &amp; {\Lambda^2}_1 &amp; {\Lambda^2}_2 &amp; {\Lambda^2}_3 \\
    {\Lambda^3}_0 &amp; {\Lambda^3}_1 &amp; {\Lambda^3}_2 &amp; {\Lambda^3}_3 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    x^0 \\
    x^1 \\
    x^2 \\
    x^3
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

allows the transformation of other physical quantities that cannot be expressed as four-vectors; e.g., [[tensor]]s or [[spinor]]s of any order in 4d spacetime, to be defined. In the corresponding [[tensor index notation]], the above matrix expression is

:&lt;math&gt;{x^\prime}^\nu = {\Lambda^\nu}_\mu x^\mu,&lt;/math&gt;

where lower and upper indices label [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant and contravariant components]] respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematics for Physicists |first1=Philippe |last1=Dennery |first2=André |last2=Krzywicki |publisher=Courier Corporation |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-486-15712-2 |page=138 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogHCAgAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=ogHCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA138 Extract of page 138]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[summation convention]] is applied. It is a standard convention to use [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] indices that take the value 0 for time components, and 1, 2, 3 for space components, while [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] indices simply take the values 1, 2, 3, for spatial components. Note that the first index (reading left to right) corresponds in the matrix notation to a ''row index''. The second index corresponds to the column index.

The transformation matrix is universal for all [[four-vector]]s, not just 4-dimensional spacetime coordinates. If {{math|''A''}} is any four-vector, then in [[tensor index notation]]

:&lt;math&gt; {A^\prime}^\nu = {\Lambda^\nu}_\mu A^\mu \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, one writes

:&lt;math&gt; A^{\nu'} = {\Lambda^{\nu'}}_\mu A^\mu \,.&lt;/math&gt;

in which the primed indices denote the indices of A in the primed frame. This notation cuts risk of exhausting the Greek alphabet roughly in half.

For a general {{math|''n''}}-component object one may write

:&lt;math&gt;{X'}^\alpha = {\Pi(\Lambda)^\alpha}_\beta X^\beta \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|Π}} is the appropriate [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group|representation of the Lorentz group]], an {{math|''n''×''n''}} matrix for every {{math|Λ}}. In this case, the indices should ''not'' be thought of as spacetime indices (sometimes called Lorentz indices), and they run from {{math|1}} to {{math|''n''}}. E.g., if {{mvar|X}} is a [[bispinor]], then the indices are called ''Dirac indices''.

=== Covariant vectors ===
There are also vector quantities with covariant indices. They are generally obtained from their corresponding objects with contravariant indices by the operation of ''lowering an index''; e.g.,

:&lt;math&gt;x_\nu = \eta_{\mu\nu}x^\mu,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''η''}} is the [[metric tensor]]. (The linked article also provides more information about what the operation of raising and lowering indices really is mathematically.) The inverse of this transformation is given by

:&lt;math&gt;x^\mu = \eta^{\nu\mu}x_\nu,&lt;/math&gt;

where, when viewed as matrices, {{math|''η''&lt;sup&gt;''μν''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the inverse of {{math|''η''&lt;sub&gt;''μν''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. As it happens, {{math|''η''&lt;sup&gt;''μν''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} {{math|''η''&lt;sub&gt;''μν''&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}. This is referred to as ''raising an index''. To transform a covariant vector {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, first raise its index, then transform it according to the same rule as for contravariant {{math|4}}-vectors, then finally lower the index;

:&lt;math&gt;{A'}_\nu = \eta_{\rho\nu} {\Lambda^\rho}_\sigma \eta^{\mu\sigma}A_\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

But

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{\rho\nu} {\Lambda^\rho}_\sigma \eta^{\mu\sigma} = {\left(\Lambda^{-1}\right)^\mu}_\nu,&lt;/math&gt;

I. e., it is the {{math|(''μ'', ''ν'')}}-component of the ''inverse'' Lorentz transformation. One defines (as a matter of notation),

:&lt;math&gt;{\Lambda_\nu}^\mu \equiv {\left(\Lambda^{-1}\right)^\mu}_\nu,&lt;/math&gt;

and may in this notation write

:&lt;math&gt;{A'}_\nu = {\Lambda_\nu}^\mu A_\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

Now for a subtlety. The implied summation on the right hand side of

:&lt;math&gt;{A'}_\nu = {\Lambda_\nu}^\mu A_\mu = {\left(\Lambda^{-1}\right)^\mu}_\nu A_\mu&lt;/math&gt;

is running over ''a row index'' of the matrix representing {{math|Λ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Thus, in terms of matrices, this transformation should be thought of as the ''inverse transpose'' of {{math|Λ}} acting on the column vector {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. That is, in pure matrix notation,

:&lt;math&gt;A' = \left(\Lambda^{-1}\right)^\mathrm{T} A.&lt;/math&gt;

This means exactly that covariant vectors (thought of as column matrices) transform according to the [[dual representation]] of the standard representation of the Lorentz group. This notion generalizes to general representations, simply replace {{math|Λ}} with {{math|Π(Λ)}}.

=== Tensors ===
If {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} are linear operators on vector spaces {{mvar|U}} and {{mvar|V}}, then a linear operator {{math|''A'' ⊗ ''B''}} may be defined on the [[tensor product]] of {{mvar|U}} and {{mvar|V}}, denoted {{math|''U'' ⊗ ''V''}} according to&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2003|loc=Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1

From this it is immediately clear that if {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} are a four-vectors in {{mvar|V}}, then {{math|''u'' ⊗ ''v'' ∈ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''V'' ≡ ''V'' ⊗ ''V''}} transforms as

The second step uses the bilinearity of the tensor product and the last step defines a 2-tensor on component form, or rather, it just renames the tensor {{math|''u'' ⊗ ''v''}}.

These observations generalize in an obvious way to more factors, and using the fact that a general tensor on a vector space {{math|''V''}} can be written as a sum of a coefficient (component!) times tensor products of basis vectors and basis covectors, one arrives at the transformation law for any [[tensor]] quantity {{math|''T''}}. It is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where {{math|''Λ&lt;sub&gt;χ&amp;prime;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ψ&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is defined above. This form can generally be reduced to the form for general {{math|''n''}}-component objects given above with a single matrix ({{math|Π(Λ)}}) operating on column vectors. This latter form is sometimes preferred; e.g., for the electromagnetic field tensor.

==== Transformation of the electromagnetic field ====
[[File:Lorentz boost electric charge.svg|300px|thumb|Lorentz boost of an electric charge, the charge is at rest in one frame or the other.]]
{{main|Electromagnetic tensor}}
{{Further|classical electromagnetism and special relativity}}

Lorentz transformations can also be used to illustrate that the [[magnetic field]] {{math|'''B'''}} and [[electric field]] {{math|'''E'''}} are simply different aspects of the same force — the [[electromagnetic force]], as a consequence of relative motion between [[electric charge]]s and observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|Phillips|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the electromagnetic field shows relativistic effects becomes clear by carrying out a simple thought experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffiths|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An observer measures a charge at rest in frame F. The observer will detect a static electric field.  As the charge is stationary in this frame, there is no electric current, so the observer does not observe any magnetic field.
*The other observer in frame F′ moves at velocity {{math|'''v'''}} relative to F and the charge. ''This'' observer sees a different electric field because the charge moves at velocity {{math|−'''v'''}} in their rest frame. The motion of the charge corresponds to an [[electric current]], and thus the observer in frame F′ also sees a magnetic field.

The electric and magnetic fields transform differently from space and time, but exactly the same way as relativistic angular momentum and the boost vector.

The electromagnetic field strength tensor is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
  F^{\mu\nu} = \begin{bmatrix}
    0              &amp; -\frac{1}{c}E_x &amp; -\frac{1}{c}E_y &amp; -\frac{1}{c}E_z \\
    \frac{1}{c}E_x &amp;  0              &amp; -B_z            &amp;  B_y   \\
    \frac{1}{c}E_y &amp;  B_z            &amp;  0              &amp; -B_x   \\
    \frac{1}{c}E_z &amp; -B_y            &amp;  B_x            &amp;  0
  \end{bmatrix} \text{(SI units, signature }(+,-,-,-)\text{)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

in [[SI units]]. In relativity, the [[Gaussian units|Gaussian system of units]] is often preferred over SI units, even in texts whose main choice of units is SI units, because in it the electric field {{math|'''E'''}} and the magnetic induction {{math|'''B'''}} have the same units making the appearance of the [[Electromagnetic tensor|electromagnetic field tensor]] more natural.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consider a Lorentz boost in the {{math|''x''}}-direction. It is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  {\Lambda^\mu}_\nu = \begin{bmatrix}
     \gamma      &amp; -\gamma\beta &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
    -\gamma\beta &amp;  \gamma      &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
     0           &amp;  0           &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
     0           &amp;  0           &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
  \end{bmatrix}, \qquad

  F^{\mu\nu} = \begin{bmatrix}
     0   &amp;  E_x &amp;  E_y &amp;  E_z \\
    -E_x &amp;  0   &amp;  B_z &amp; -B_y \\
    -E_y &amp; -B_z &amp;  0   &amp;  B_x \\
    -E_z &amp;  B_y &amp; -B_x &amp;  0
  \end{bmatrix} \text{(Gaussian units, signature }(-,+,+,+)\text{)},
&lt;/math&gt;

where the field tensor is displayed side by side for easiest possible reference in the manipulations below.

The general transformation law {{EquationNote|(T3)}} becomes

:&lt;math&gt;F^{\mu'\nu'} = {\Lambda^{\mu'}}_\mu {\Lambda^{\nu'}}_\nu F^{\mu\nu}.&lt;/math&gt;

For the magnetic field one obtains
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  B_{x'} &amp;= F^{2'3'}
            = {\Lambda^2}_\mu {\Lambda^3}_\nu F^{\mu\nu}
            = {\Lambda^2}_2 {\Lambda^3}_3 F^{23}
            = 1 \times 1 \times B_x \\
         &amp;= B_x, \\
  B_{y'} &amp;= F^{3'1'}
            = {\Lambda^3}_\mu {\Lambda^1}_\nu F^{\mu \nu}
            = {\Lambda^3}_3 {\Lambda^1}_\nu F^{3\nu}
            = {\Lambda^3}_3 {\Lambda^1}_0 F^{30} + {\Lambda^3}_3 {\Lambda^1}_1 F^{31} \\
         &amp;= 1 \times (-\beta\gamma) (-E_z) + 1 \times \gamma B_y
            = \gamma B_y + \beta\gamma E_z \\
         &amp;= \gamma\left(\mathbf{B} - \boldsymbol{\beta} \times \mathbf{E}\right)_y \\
  B_{z'} &amp;= F^{1'2'}
            = {\Lambda^1}_\mu {\Lambda^2}_\nu F^{\mu\nu}
            = {\Lambda^1}_\mu {\Lambda^2}_2 F^{\mu 2}
            = {\Lambda^1}_0 {\Lambda^2}_2 F^{02} + {\Lambda^1}_1 {\Lambda^2}_2 F^{12} \\

         &amp;= \gamma\left(\mathbf{B} - \boldsymbol{\beta} \times \mathbf{E}\right)_z
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For the electric field results

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  E_{x'} &amp;= F^{0'1'}
            = {\Lambda^0}_\mu {\Lambda^1}_\nu F^{\mu\nu}
            = {\Lambda^0}_1 {\Lambda^1}_0 F^{10} + {\Lambda^0}_0 {\Lambda^1}_1 F^{01} \\
         &amp;= (-\gamma\beta)(-\gamma\beta)(-E_x) + \gamma\gamma E_x
            = -\gamma^2\beta^2(E_x) + \gamma^2 E_x
            = E_x(1 - \beta^2)\gamma^2 \\
         &amp;= E_x, \\
  E_{y'} &amp;= F^{0'2'}
            = {\Lambda^0}_\mu {\Lambda^2}_\nu F^{\mu\nu}
            = {\Lambda^0}_\mu {\Lambda^2}_2 F^{\mu 2}
            = {\Lambda^0}_0 {\Lambda^2}_2 F^{02} + {\Lambda^0}_1 {\Lambda^2}_2 F^{12} \\
         &amp;= \gamma \times 1 \times E_y + (-\beta\gamma) \times 1 \times B_z
            = \gamma E_y - \beta\gamma B_z \\
         &amp;= \gamma\left(\mathbf{E} + \boldsymbol{\beta} \times \mathbf{B}\right)_y \\
  E_{z'} &amp;= F^{0'3'}
            = {\Lambda^0}_\mu {\Lambda^3}_\nu F^{\mu\nu}
            = {\Lambda^0}_\mu {\Lambda^3}_3 F^{\mu 3}
            = {\Lambda^0}_0 {\Lambda^3}_3 F^{03} + {\Lambda^0}_1 {\Lambda^3}_3 F^{13} \\
         &amp;= \gamma \times 1 \times E_z - \beta\gamma \times 1 \times (-B_y)
            = \gamma E_z + \beta\gamma B_y \\
         &amp;= \gamma\left(\mathbf{E} + \boldsymbol{\beta} \times \mathbf{B}\right)_z.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, {{math|'''''β''''' {{=}} (''β'', 0, 0)}} is used. These results can be summarized by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
  \mathbf{E}_{\parallel'} &amp;= \mathbf{E}_\parallel \\
  \mathbf{B}_{\parallel'} &amp;= \mathbf{B}_\parallel \\
       \mathbf{E}_{\bot'} &amp;= \gamma \left( \mathbf{E}_\bot + \boldsymbol{\beta} \times \mathbf{B}_\bot \right) = \gamma \left( \mathbf{E} + \boldsymbol{\beta} \times \mathbf{B} \right)_\bot,\\
       \mathbf{B}_{\bot'} &amp;= \gamma \left( \mathbf{B}_\bot - \boldsymbol{\beta} \times \mathbf{E}_\bot \right) = \gamma \left( \mathbf{B} - \boldsymbol{\beta} \times \mathbf{E} \right)_\bot,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and are independent of the metric signature. For SI units, substitute {{math|''E'' → {{frac|''E''|''c''}}}}. {{harvtxt|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973}} refer to this last form as the {{math|3 + 1}} view as opposed to the ''geometric view'' represented by the tensor expression
:&lt;math&gt;F^{\mu'\nu'} = {\Lambda^{\mu'}}_\mu {\Lambda^{\nu'}}_\nu F^{\mu\nu},&lt;/math&gt;
and make a strong point of the ease with which results that are difficult to achieve using the {{math|3 + 1}} view can be obtained and understood. Only objects that have well defined Lorentz transformation properties (in fact under ''any'' smooth coordinate transformation) are geometric objects. In the geometric view, the electromagnetic field is a six-dimensional geometric object in ''spacetime'' as opposed to two interdependent, but separate, 3-vector fields in ''space'' and ''time''. The fields {{math|'''E'''}} (alone) and {{math|'''B'''}} (alone) do not have well defined Lorentz transformation properties. The mathematical underpinnings are equations {{EquationNote|(T1)}} and {{EquationNote|(T2)}} that immediately yield {{EquationNote|(T3)}}. One should note that the primed and unprimed tensors refer to the ''same event in spacetime''. Thus the complete equation with spacetime dependence is
:&lt;math&gt;
  F^{\mu' \nu'}\left(x'\right) =
    {\Lambda^{\mu'}}_\mu {\Lambda^{\nu'}}_\nu F^{\mu\nu}\left(\Lambda^{-1} x'\right) =
    {\Lambda^{\mu'}}_\mu {\Lambda^{\nu'}}_\nu F^{\mu\nu}(x).
&lt;/math&gt;

Length contraction has an effect on [[charge density]] {{math|''ρ''}} and [[current density]] {{math|'''J'''}}, and time dilation has an effect on the rate of flow of charge (current), so charge and current distributions must transform in a related way under a boost. It turns out they transform exactly like the space-time and energy-momentum four-vectors,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{j}' &amp;= \mathbf{j} - \gamma\rho v\mathbf{n} + \left( \gamma - 1 \right)(\mathbf{j} \cdot \mathbf{n})\mathbf{n} \\
        \rho' &amp;= \gamma \left(\rho - \mathbf{j} \cdot \frac{v\mathbf{n}}{c^2}\right),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

or, in the simpler geometric view,
:&lt;math&gt;j^{\mu^\prime} = {\Lambda^{\mu'}}_\mu j^\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

One says that charge density transforms as the time component of a four-vector. It is a rotational scalar. The current density is a 3-vector.

The [[Maxwell equations]] are invariant under Lorentz transformations.

=== Spinors ===
Equation {{EquationNote|(T1)}} hold unmodified for any representation of the Lorentz group, including the [[bispinor]] representation. In {{EquationNote|(T2)}} one simply replaces all occurrences of {{math|Λ}} by the bispinor representation {{math|Π(Λ)}},

{{Equation box 1
 |indent =:
 |equation = 
:&lt;math&gt;u \otimes v \rightarrow \Pi(\Lambda) u \otimes \Pi(\Lambda) v =
  {\Pi(\Lambda)^\alpha}_\beta u^\beta \otimes {\Pi(\Lambda)^\rho}_\sigma v^\sigma =
  {\Pi(\Lambda)^\alpha}_\beta {\Pi(\Lambda)^\rho}_\sigma u^\beta \otimes v^\sigma \equiv
  {\Pi(\Lambda)^\alpha}_\beta {\Pi(\Lambda)^\rho}_\sigma w^{\alpha\beta}.

The above equation could, for instance, be the transformation of a state in [[Fock space]] describing two free electrons.

==== Transformation of general fields ====
A general ''noninteracting'' multi-particle state (Fock space state) in [[quantum field theory]] transforms according to the rule&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberg|2002|loc=Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maxwell's demon.svg|right|310px|thumb|Schematic figure of Maxwell's demon]]

In the [[philosophy of thermal and statistical physics]], '''Maxwell's demon''' is a [[thought experiment]] created by the physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1867 in which he suggested how the [[second law of thermodynamics]] might hypothetically be violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cargill Gilston Knott |title=Life and Scientific Work of Peter Guthrie Tait |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1911 |pages=213–215 |chapter=Quote from undated letter from Maxwell to Tait | url=https://archive.org/stream/lifescientificwo00knotuoft#page/212/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the thought experiment, a [[Demon (thought experiment)|demon]] controls a small door between two chambers of gas. As individual gas molecules approach the door, the demon quickly opens and shuts the door so that only fast molecules are passed into one of the chambers, while only slow molecules are passed into the other. Because faster molecules are hotter, the demon's behaviour causes one chamber to warm up and the other to cool down, thereby decreasing [[entropy]] and violating the second law of thermodynamics.   This thought experiment has provoked debate and theoretical work on the relation between thermodynamics and [[information theory]] extending to the present day, with a number of scientists arguing that theoretical considerations rule out any practical device violating the second law in this way.

== Origin and history of the idea ==
The [[thought experiment]] first appeared in a letter [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] wrote to [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] on 11 December 1867. It appeared again in a letter to [[John William Strutt]] in 1871, before it was presented to the public in Maxwell's 1872 book on [[thermodynamics]] titled ''Theory of Heat''.&lt;ref name=Leff&gt;[[#Leff Rex 02|Leff &amp; Rex (2002)]], p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his letters and books, Maxwell described the agent opening the door between the chambers as a "finite being". [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]] was the first to use the word "demon" for Maxwell's concept, in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1874, and implied that he intended the mediating, rather than malevolent, connotation of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] |year=1874 |title=Kinetic theory of the dissipation of energy |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=9 |issue=232 |pages=441–444 |doi=10.1038/009441c0 |bibcode=1874Natur...9..441T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1879 |title=The sorting demon Of Maxwell |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Institution|volume=ix |issue=501 |page=113|bibcode=1879Natur..20Q.126. |doi=10.1038/020126a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;{{cite book |author=Alan S. Weber |year=2000 |title=Nineteenth Century Science: a Selection of Original Texts |publisher=[[Broadview Press]] |page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Original thought experiment ==
The second law of thermodynamics ensures (through statistical probability) that two bodies of different [[temperature]], when brought into contact with each other and isolated from the rest of the Universe, will evolve to a thermodynamic equilibrium in which both bodies have approximately the same temperature.&lt;ref name="Bennett87"&gt;{{cite journal

Maxwell conceived a thought experiment as a way of furthering the understanding of the second law. His description of the experiment is as follows:&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell (1871), reprinted in [[#Leff Rex 90|Leff &amp; Rex (1990)]] on p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... if we conceive of a being whose faculties are so sharpened that he can follow every molecule in its course, such a being, whose attributes are as essentially finite as our own, would be able to do what is impossible to us. For we have seen that molecules in a vessel full of air at uniform temperature are moving with velocities by no means uniform, though the mean velocity of any great number of them, arbitrarily selected, is almost exactly uniform. Now let us suppose that such a vessel is divided into two portions, ''A'' and ''B'', by a division in which there is a small hole, and that a being, who can see the individual molecules, opens and closes this hole, so as to allow only the swifter molecules to pass from ''A'' to ''B'', and only the slower molecules to pass from ''B'' to ''A''. He will thus, without expenditure of work, raise the temperature of ''B'' and lower that of ''A'', in contradiction to the second law of thermodynamics.}}In other words, Maxwell imagines one container divided into two parts, ''A'' and ''B''.&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sagawa"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both parts are filled with the same [[gas]] at equal temperatures and placed next to each other. Observing the [[molecule]]s on both sides, an imaginary [[Demon (thought experiment)|demon]] guards a trapdoor between the two parts. When a faster-than-average molecule from ''A'' flies towards the trapdoor, the demon opens it, and the molecule will fly from ''A'' to ''B''. Likewise, when a slower-than-average molecule from ''B'' flies towards the trapdoor, the demon will let it pass from ''B'' to ''A''. The average [[speed]] of the molecules in ''B'' will have increased while in ''A'' they will have slowed down on average. Since average molecular speed corresponds to temperature, the temperature decreases in ''A'' and increases in ''B'', contrary to the second law of thermodynamics.  A [[heat engine]] operating between the thermal reservoirs ''A'' and ''B'' could extract useful [[work (physics)|work]] from this temperature difference.

The demon must allow molecules to pass in both directions in order to produce only a temperature difference; one-way passage only of faster-than-average molecules from ''A'' to ''B'' will cause higher temperature and pressure to develop on the ''B'' side.

== Criticism and development ==
Several physicists have presented calculations that show that the [[second law of thermodynamics]] will not actually be violated, if a more complete analysis is made of the whole system including the demon.&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sagawa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BennettSchumacher"&gt;{{cite journal

That is, it would take more thermodynamic work to gauge the speed of the molecules and selectively allow them to pass through the opening between ''A'' and ''B'' than the amount of [[energy]] gained by the difference of temperature caused by this.

One of the most famous responses to this question was suggested in 1929 by [[Leó Szilárd]],&lt;ref name="Szilard"&gt;{{cite journal

English translation available as [http://aurellem.org/jaynes/sources/Szilard.pdf  NASA document TT F-16723] published 1976&lt;/ref&gt; and later by [[Léon Brillouin]].&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sagawa" /&gt;  Szilárd pointed out that a real-life Maxwell's demon would need to have some means of measuring molecular speed, and that the act of acquiring information would require an expenditure of energy. Since the demon and the gas are interacting, we must consider the total entropy of the gas and the demon combined. The expenditure of energy by the demon will cause an increase in the entropy of the demon, which will be larger than the lowering of the entropy of the gas.

In 1960, [[Rolf Landauer]] raised an exception to this argument.&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sagawa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Landauer"&gt;{{cite journal

He suggested these "reversible" measurements could be used to sort the molecules, violating the Second Law. However, due to [[Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory|the connection between]] thermodynamic entropy and [[information entropy]], this also meant that the recorded measurement must not be erased. In other words, to determine whether to let a molecule through, the demon must acquire information about the state of the molecule and either discard it or store it. Discarding it leads to immediate increase in entropy but the demon cannot store it indefinitely: In 1982, [[Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist)|Charles Bennett]] showed that, however well prepared, eventually the demon will run out of information storage space and must begin to erase the information it has previously gathered.&lt;ref name="Sagawa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett82"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bennett | first1 = C.

Although Bennett had reached the same conclusion as Szilard’s 1929 paper, that a Maxwellian demon could not violate the second law because entropy would be created, he had reached it for different reasons.  Regarding [[Landauer's principle]], the minimum energy dissipated by deleting information was experimentally measured by Eric Lutz ''et al.'' in 2012. Furthermore, Lutz ''et al.'' confirmed that in order to approach the Landauer's limit, the system must asymptotically approach zero processing speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=jobs |url=http://www.nature.com/news/the-unavoidable-cost-of-computation-revealed-1.10186 |title=The unavoidable cost of computation revealed : Nature News &amp; Comment |publisher=Nature.com |date=2012-03-07 |accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Earman]] and John D. Norton have argued that Szilárd and Landauer's explanations of Maxwell's demon begin by assuming that the [[second law of thermodynamics]] cannot be violated by the demon, and derive further properties of the demon from this assumption, including the necessity of consuming energy when erasing information, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=John Earman  |author2=John D.

Bennett later acknowledged the validity of Earman and Norton's argument, while maintaining that [[Landauer's principle]] explains the mechanism by which real systems do not violate the second law of thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Charles H.

== Recent progress ==
Although the argument by Landauer and Bennett only answers the consistency between the second law of thermodynamics and the whole cyclic process of the entire system of a [[Szilard engine]] (a composite system of the engine and the demon), a recent approach based on the [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]] for small fluctuating systems has provided deeper insight on each information process with each subsystem. From this viewpoint, the measurement process is regarded as a process where the correlation ([[mutual information]]) between the engine and the demon increases, and the feedback process is regarded as a process where the correlation decreases. If the correlation changes, thermodynamic relations as the second law of thermodynamics and the [[fluctuation theorem]] for each subsystem should be modified, and for the case of external control a second-law like inequality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hugo Touchette  |author2=Seth Lloyd  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2000 |title=Information-Theoretic Limits of Control |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=84 |issue=6  |pages=1156–1159 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.1156|bibcode = 2000PhRvL..84.1156T |pmid=11017467|arxiv=chao-dyn/9905039  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a generalized fluctuation theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Takahiro Sagawa  |author2=Masahito Ueda   |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010 |title=Generalized Jarzynski Equality under Nonequilibrium Feedback Control |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=104 |issue=9   |pages=090602 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.090602|pmid=20366975   |arxiv = 0907.4914 |bibcode = 2010PhRvL.104i0602S }}&lt;/ref&gt; with mutual information are satisfied. These relations suggest that we need extra thermodynamic cost to increase correlation (measurement case), and in contrast we can apparently violate the second law up to the consumption of correlation (feedback case). For more general information processes including biological information processing, both inequality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Armen E Allahverdyan, Dominik Janzing and Guenter Mahler |year=2009 |title=Thermodynamic efficiency of information and heat flow |journal=Journal of Statistical Mechanics |volume=2009 |issue=9 |pages=P09011 |doi=10.1088/1742-5468/2009/09/P09011|arxiv = 0907.3320 |bibcode = 2009JSMTE..09..011A }}&lt;/ref&gt; and equality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Naoto Shiraishi  |author2=Takahiro Sagawa  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2015 |title=Fluctuation theorem for partially masked nonequilibrium dynamics |journal=Physical Review E |volume=91 |issue=1  |pages=012130 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.91.012130|pmid=25679593  |arxiv = 1403.4018 |bibcode = 2015PhRvE..91a2130S }}&lt;/ref&gt; with mutual information hold.

== Applications ==
Real-life versions of Maxwellian demons occur, but all such "real demons" have their entropy-lowering effects duly balanced by increase of entropy elsewhere. Molecular-sized mechanisms are no longer found only in biology; they are also the subject of the emerging field of [[nanotechnology]]. Single-atom traps used by particle physicists allow an experimenter to control the state of individual quanta in a way similar to Maxwell's demon.

If hypothetical [[mirror matter]] exists, Zurab Silagadze proposes that demons can be envisaged, "which can act like perpetuum mobiles of the second kind: extract heat energy from only one reservoir, use it to do work and be isolated from the rest of ordinary world. Yet the Second Law is not violated because the demons pay their entropy cost in the hidden (mirror) sector of the world by emitting mirror photons."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=physics/0608114 |title=Maxwell's demon through the looking glass |journal=Acta Physica Polonica B |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=101–126 |year=2007 |last1=Silagadze |first1=Z.

== Experimental work ==
In the February 2007 issue of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', [[David Leigh (scientist)|David Leigh]], a professor at the [[University of Edinburgh]], announced the creation of a nano-device based on the  [[Brownian ratchet]] popularized by [[Richard Feynman]]. Leigh's device is able to drive a chemical system out of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], but it must be powered by an external source ([[light]] in this case) and therefore does not violate thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature05452 | volume=445 | issue=7127 | title=A molecular information ratchet | journal=Nature | pages=523–527 | pmid=17268466 | date=February 2007 | last1 = Serreli | first1 = V | last2 = Lee | first2 = CF | last3 = Kay | first3 = ER | last4 = Leigh | first4 = DA| bibcode=2007Natur.445..523S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, researchers including Nobel Prize winner [[Fraser Stoddart]], created ring-shaped molecules called [[rotaxane]]s which could be placed on an axle connecting two sites, ''A'' and ''B''. Particles from either site would bump into the ring and move it from end to end. If a large collection of these devices were placed in a system, half of the devices had the ring at site ''A'' and half at ''B'', at any given moment in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bissell|first1=Richard A|last2=Córdova|first2=Emilio|last3=Kaifer|first3=Angel E.|last4=Stoddart|first4=J. Fraser|title=A chemically and electrochemically switchable molecular shuttle|journal=Nature|date=12 May 1994|volume=369|issue=6476|pages=133–137|doi=10.1038/369133a0|bibcode=1994Natur.369..133B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leigh made a minor change to the axle so that if a light is shone on the device, the center of the axle will thicken, restricting the motion of the ring. It only keeps the ring from moving, however, if it is at ''A''. Over time, therefore, the rings will be bumped from ''B'' to ''A'' and get stuck there, creating an imbalance in the system. In his experiments, Leigh was able to take a pot of "billions of these devices" from 50:50 equilibrium to a 70:30 imbalance within a few minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Katharine Sanderson |date=31 January 2007 |title=A demon of a device |publisher=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume= |doi=10.1038/news070129-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 [[Mark G. Raizen]] developed a laser atomic cooling technique which realizes the process Maxwell envisioned of sorting individual atoms in a gas into different containers based on their energy.&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Raizen2009"&gt;{{cite journal

The operation of the one-way wall relies on an irreversible atomic and molecular process of absorption of a photon at a specific wavelength, followed by spontaneous emission to a different internal state. The irreversible process is coupled to a conservative force created by magnetic fields and/or light. Raizen and collaborators proposed using the one-way wall in order to reduce the entropy of an ensemble of atoms. In parallel, Gonzalo Muga and Andreas Ruschhaupt independently developed a similar concept. Their "atom diode" was not proposed for cooling, but rather for regulating the flow of atoms. The Raizen Group demonstrated significant cooling of atoms with the one-way wall in a series of experiments in 2008. Subsequently, the operation of a one-way wall for atoms was demonstrated by Daniel Steck and collaborators later in 2008. Their experiment was based on the 2005 scheme for the one-way wall, and was not used for cooling. The cooling method realized by the Raizen Group was called "single-photon cooling", because only one photon on average is required in order to bring an atom to near-rest. This is in contrast to other laser cooling techniques which use the momentum of the photon and require a two-level cycling transition.

In 2006, Raizen, Muga, and Ruschhaupt showed in a theoretical paper that as each atom crosses the one-way wall, it scatters one photon, and information is provided about the turning point and hence the energy of that particle. The entropy increase of the radiation field scattered from a directional laser into a random direction is exactly balanced by the entropy reduction of the atoms as they are trapped by the one-way wall.

This technique is widely described as a "Maxwell's demon" because it realizes Maxwell's process of creating a temperature difference by sorting high and low energy atoms into different containers.  However, scientists have pointed out that it is not a true Maxwell's demon in the sense that it does not violate the [[second law of thermodynamics]];&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Orzel"&gt;{{cite web

This is because the process requires more energy from the laser beams than could be produced by the temperature difference generated.  The atoms absorb low entropy photons from the laser beam and emit them in a random direction, thus increasing the entropy of the environment.&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Orzel" /&gt;

== As metaphor ==
[[Daemon (computing)|Daemons in computing]], generally processes that run on servers to respond to users, are named for Maxwell's demon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.takeourword.com/TOW146/page4.html|author=[[Fernando J. Corbató]]|title=Take Our Word for It|date=2002-01-23|accessdate=2006-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Henry Brooks Adams]] in his manuscript ''[[The Rule of Phase Applied to History]]'' attempted to use Maxwell's demon as a historical [[metaphor]], though he misunderstood and misapplied the original principle.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cater|Cater (1947)]], pp. 640–647; see also Daub (1970), reprinted in [[#Leff Rex 90|Leff &amp; Rex (1990)]], pp. 37–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Adams interpreted [[history]] as a process moving towards "equilibrium", but he saw [[militarism|militaristic]] nations (he felt [[Germany]] pre-eminent in this class) as tending to reverse this process, a Maxwell's demon of history. Adams made many attempts to respond to the criticism of his formulation from his scientific colleagues, but the work remained incomplete at Adams' death in 1918. It was only published posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adams|Adams (1919)]], p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] incorporated Maxwell's demon into his work, "[[Raisons Pratiques]]" as a metaphor for the socioeconomic inequality among students, as maintained by the school system, the economy, and families.

==In fiction==
A machine powered by Maxwell's demon plays a role in [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s novel ''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]''.

The demon is mentioned several times in ''[[The Cyberiad]]'', a series of short stories by the noted science fiction writer [[Stanisław Lem]]. In the book the demon appears both in its original form and in a modified form where it uses its knowledge of all particles in the box in order to surmise general (but unfocused and random) facts about the rest of the universe.

The demon is implied in [[Larry Niven]]'s short story "[[Unfinished Story Nr 2]]", within the context of a world of magic, depending on local concentrations of 'manna', a prerequirement for magic such that magic is no longer possible after manna has been locally depleted.

'''Meschac Gaba''' (born 1961) is a Beninese conceptual artist based in [[Rotterdam]] and [[Cotonou]]. His [[installation art|installations]] of everyday objects whimsically juxtapose African and Western cultural identities and commerce. He is best known for ''The Museum of Contemporary African Art 1997–2002'', an autobiographical 12-room installation acquired and displayed by the [[Tate Modern]] in 2013. He has also exhibited at the [[Studio Museum in Harlem]] and at the 2003 [[Venice Biennale]].

== Early life and career ==

Meschac Gaba was born in [[Cotonou, Benin]], in 1961. He had drifted from his training as a painter until a bag of decommissioned money cut into confetti led him to make paintings with the material.{{r|Independent 2013}} Gaba became known for his installations of everyday objects that whimsically juxtapose African and Western cultural identities and commerce.{{r|Artsy: Ossei-Mensah}}

He held a residency at the Amsterdam [[Rijksakademie]] in 1996 for two years.{{r|Independent 2013}} In the absence of opportunities to display his work in the city, he set out over the next five years to make his own museum.{{r|Guardian: Brown 2013}} This piece became his seminal ''The Museum of Contemporary African Art 1997–2002'', which consists of 12 rooms (some based on museum function and others personal) filled with objects made by Gaba.{{r|Independent 2013|AiA: Walleston}} Throughout the exhibition ran a vein of confessional narrative about the artist's art travails between Africa and Europe.{{r|Guardian: Jones 2013}} The wedding room, which he made while in love,{{r|Independent 2013}} holds mementos as museum artifacts from Gaba's wedding to the Dutch curator Alexandra van Dongen in 2000 at the Amsterdam [[Stedelijk Museum]].{{r|Guardian: Jones 2013|Guardian: Brown 2013}} The Library room holds [[art books]] and tells of Gaba's childhood.{{r|Guardian: Jones 2013}} The games room showed [[sliding puzzle]] tables that form African national flags.{{r|Guardian: Brown 2013}} It had its own [[gift shop]] and café.{{r|Guardian: Sherwin 2013}} The exhibited ''Museum'' had couches for reading, a piano for playing, and featured objects reflecting Africa's polycultural character, including Ghanaian money featuring the face of [[Picasso]], a Swiss bank mimicking an African [[street market]], and gilded ceramic chicken legs.{{r|Guardian: Jones 2013|AiA: Walleston}}

The ''Museum'' exhibited widely.{{r|Independent 2013}} The work was first displayed in part in 2002 at [[Documenta 11]].{{r|AiA: Walleston}} Gaba received a Rotterdam space in which he could live and store the work.{{r|Independent 2013}} When his son requested a more normal house, Gaba sold and gifted most of the work to the [[Tate Modern]], save for his Library, which Gaba returned to his hometown.{{r|Independent 2013|Guardian: Brown 2013}} Around 2013, Gaba lived half the year in his hometown of Cotonou and the other half in Rotterdam with his wife and son.{{r|Independent 2013}} The Tate Modern displayed the work as a whole in 2013{{r|AiA: Walleston}} as part of the Tate's two-year program of African-focused exhibitions.{{r|Guardian: Higgins 2012}} The wedding room enchanted the British [[art critic]] [[Jonathan Jones (journalist)|Jonathan Jones]], who described the ''Museum'' as autobiographical, novelistic, protest showing "the strength of modern African art".{{r|Guardian: Jones 2013}} For instance, the Art and Religion room showed "classic" African ceremonial sculpture alongside kitschy Buddhist and Christian objects, as if to group the types together as poor representations of their respective cultures.{{r|Guardian: Jones 2013}} Gaba saw the work as correcting lacks of art education in Africa and African art representation outside the continent.{{r|AiA: Walleston}}

In-between finishing the ''Museum'' and its Tate exhibition, Gaba presented at the 2003 [[Venice Biennale]] and held his first solo show in the United States at the [[Studio Museum in Harlem]], "Tresses", a series of architectural models of New York City and Benin landmarks made from artificial braided [[hair extensions]]. The accessory, popularized by African-American pop stars based on West African culture, was repatriated to Africa. Gaba worked with a Beninese hair braider to make the sculptures from his photographs. ''The New York Times'' wrote that the works were "delightful" and  recognizable without becoming caricatures.{{r|NYT: Cotter}}

Gaba held his first solo gallery show, "Exchange Market", in New York in 2014. On the ground floor, 10 sculptures of unvarnished wood tables each with a wire umbrella stand, from which African banknotes hung. Each table was associated with a type of commodity: cotton, cocoa, diamonds. Along the walls hung bank-shaped works made of wood, [[plexiglass]], and decommissioned money. Upstairs, reminiscent of the games room of Gaba's museum, were four [[foosball]] tables and small souvenir sculptures such as hand-painted [[cricket bats]] and a miniature billiards table.{{r|AiA: Walleston}}

'''Mithyatva''' means "false belief", and an important concept in [[Jainism]] and [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=jljaini&gt;JL Jaini (Editor: FW Thomas), Outlines of Jainism, Jain Literature Society, Cambridge University Press Archive, page 94&lt;/ref&gt; Disappearance (''nivrtti'') is the necessary presupposition of ''mithyatva'' because what is falsely perceived ceases to exist with the dawn of right knowledge. ''Mithyatva'', states Jayatirtha, cannot be easily defined as 'indefinable', 'non-existent', 'something other than real', 'which cannot be proved, produced by [[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]] or as its effect', or as 'the nature of being perceived in the same locus along with its own absolute non-existence'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Dvaita School of Vedanta and its Literature|author=B.N.Krishnamurti Sharma|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=167|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FVtpFMPMulcC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;dq=mithyatva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gEGwUu_LFIbQ7AaH14BY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mithyatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mithyatva is a concept in [[Jainism]] distinguishing right knowledge from false knowledge, and parallels the concepts of ''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]]'' in the [[Vedanta]] school of Hinduism, ''Aviveka'' in its [[Samkhya]] school, and ''Maya'' in [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=jljaini48&gt;JL Jaini (Editor: FW Thomas), Outlines of Jainism, Jain Literature Society, Cambridge University Press Archive, page 48-58&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposite of ''Mithyatva'' (false belief) is ''Samyaktva'' (right belief).&lt;ref name=robertwilliams47&gt;Robert Williams (1998), Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval Śrāvakācāras, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807754}}, page 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jainism==
Mithyatva is an important concept on false knowledge in Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;JL Jaini (Editor: FW Thomas), Outlines of Jainism, Jain Literature Society, Cambridge University Press Archive, pages 48-64, 94-95&lt;/ref&gt; The Jaina scholar [[Hemachandra]] defined Mithyatva as "belief in false divinities, false gurus and false scriptures".&lt;ref name=robertwilliams47/&gt;

[[Jainism]] describes seven types of beliefs - ''mithyatva'', ''sasvadana-samyaktva'', ''mishra-mithyatva'', ''kashopashmika-samyaktva'', ''aupshamika-samyaktva'', ''vedak-samyaktva'' and ''kshayik-samyaktva''. ''Mithyatva'', meaning false or wrong belief, is the soul’s original and beginning less state of deluded world-view, at which stage the soul is in a spiritual slumber, unaware of its own bondage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Oriental Philosophy|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|page=329|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgNHE-48jNcC&amp;pg=PA329&amp;lpg=PA329&amp;dq=types+of+mithyatva&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xQ3l4Opk4d&amp;sig=-XlEHoqdLMAqPgnv2P2lrllw1sA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FymwUqr8K42M7AaZ04FQ&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=types%20of%20mithyatva&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mithyatva'' or "false belief, delusion" are of five kinds in Jainism, according to one classification:&lt;ref name=jljaini/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. M. Joseph (1997), Jainism in South India, International School of Dravidian Linguistics, {{ISBN|978-8185692234}}, page 415&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dravya Samgraha of Nemichandra Siddhanta Chakravartti|author=Nemicandrasiddhantacakravartin|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=74-75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=svi0gpwC-5sC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=mithyatva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zy6wUsGPJeLN7AaJ-IDwDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mithyatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Ekanta'' (one sided belief, not considering other sides or aspects for truth),
#''Viparita'' (belief in the opposite of what is right),
#''Vinaya'' (universally accepting all right or wrong belief/religion without examining them, attending only to conduct),
#''Samsaya'' (when there is doubt whether a course is right or wrong, unsettled belief, skepticism), and
#''Ajnana'' (indifference to right or wrong belief).

[[Śvētāmbara|Svetambara]] Jains classify categories of false belief under ''Mithyatva'' differently: ''Abhigrahika'' (belief limited to their own scriptures that they can defend, but refusing to study and analyse other scriptures); ''Anabhigrahika'' (belief that equal respect must be shown to all gods, teachers, scriptures); ''Abhiniviseka'' (belief of those who can discern but refuse to do so from preconceptions); ''Samsayika'' (state of hesitation or uncertainty between various conflicting, inconsistent beliefs); and ''Anabhogika'' (innate, default beliefs that a person has not thought through on one's own).&lt;ref name=robertwilliams48&gt;Robert Williams (1998), Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval Śrāvakācāras, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807754}}, pages 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digambara]] Jains classify categories of false belief under ''Mithyatva'' into seven: ''Ekantika'' (absolute, one sided belief), ''Samsayika'' (uncertainty, doubt whether a course is right or wrong, unsettled belief, skepticism), ''Vainayika'' (belief that all gods, gurus and scriptures are alike), ''Grhita'' (belief derived purely from habits or default, no self analysis), ''Viparita'' (belief that true is false, false is true, everything is relative or acceptable), ''Naisargika'' (belief that living beings are devoid of consciousness and cannot discern right from wrong), ''Mudha-drsti'' (belief that violence and anger can tarnish or damage thoughts, divine, guru or [[dharma]]).&lt;ref name=robertwilliams48/&gt;

Mithyatva is one of three things, in Jainism, that are harmful stimuli and that distract a person from attaining right belief and correct knowledge. The other two things that distract, are ''[[Maya (Illusion)|Maya]]'' (deceit), and ''Nidana'' (hankering after fame and worldly pleasures).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Williams (1998), Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval Śrāvakācāras, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807754}}, page 50&lt;/ref&gt;

One Jaina text lists 28 kinds of ''mohaniya'' (deluding) ''karmas'' that prevent the true perception of reality and the purity of the soul, the ''darsana mohaniya karman'' which function to prevent a soul’s insight into its own nature and therefore, deemed destructive, are ''mithyatva karman''. The term, ''mithyatva'', meaning 'perversity', is generally used to denote the idea of ''avidya'' along with ''mithyadarsana'' or ''mithyadrsti'' (wrong view), ''darsanamoha'' (delusion of vision), ''moha'' (delusion) etc.;. The state of ''mithyatva'' is manifested as a fundamental tendency to see things other than as they really are (Tattva Sutra 8:9).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Harmless Souls|author=W.J.

==Hinduism==
{{see also|Avidya (Hinduism)|Ātman (Hinduism)|Maya (illusion)}}
Mithyatva is a concept found in some schools of Hinduism. Other concepts in Hinduism, similar in meaning to Mithyatva, include the concepts of ''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]]'' in the [[Vedanta]] school of Hinduism, ''Aviveka'' in its [[Samkhya]] school.&lt;ref name=jljaini48/&gt;

Ignorance begets ''aviveka'' (lack of correct, discriminative knowledge) states Samkhya school of Hinduism. One engages in deeds, good and bad, due to ''aviveka'', earns ''punya'' or becomes a victim of sin and is reborn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Message of the Puranas|author=B.B.Paliwal|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|page=212|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TGyzMJYZn-0C&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=avivek&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jHyxUtT8DeKAywOKv4GICA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=avivek&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aviveka also means lack of reason or imprudence or indiscretion. Avidya is related concept in Vedanta school of Hinduism. Avidya and aviveka give ''dukkha'' i.e. suffering.

[[Madhusudanah]] in his ''Advaita-siddhi'' gives five definitions of ''mithyatva'' which term is derived from ''mithya'' meaning false or indeterminable. False is something that appears and is later negated or contradicted; the unreal is never an object of experience, the concept of unreal is self-contradictory. Falsity is defined as – not being the locus of either reality or unreality, it is distinct from both reality and unreality. In practice, ''mithyatva'' has three means, – a) that which does not exist in three divisions of time, past, present and future; b) that which is removable by knowledge; and c) that which is identical with the object of sublation. Whereas ''mithya'' is other than real but not real, ''mithyatva'' is identical with sublatability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Perceiving in Advaita Vedanta|author=Bina Gupta|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=131–132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w-AE8tEDMYYC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=mithyatva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zy6wUsGPJeLN7AaJ-IDwDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mithyatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mithyatva'' may also be understood as that which is negated even where it is found to exist. The followers of the Advaita School contend that the world-appearance is negated by Brahman-knowledge and hence it is illusory. To the followers of [[Vishishtadvaita]]vada, ''mithya'' is the apprehension of an object as different from its own nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tattvamuktakalpa|author=S.M.Srinivasa Chari|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=261–263|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=un1i5icdpdoC&amp;pg=PA263&amp;dq=mithyatva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gEGwUu_LFIbQ7AaH14BY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mithyatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Advaita School considers ''Mithyatva'' to mean falsity of the world. Disappearance (''nivrtti'') is the necessary presupposition of ''mithyatva'' because what is falsely perceived ceases to exist with the dawn of right knowledge. But, ''mithya'' or falsity, or ''mithyatva'' or falsity of the world, cannot be easily defined as indefinable or non-existent or something other than real or which cannot be proved or produced by ''avidya'' (or as its effect) or as the nature of being perceived in the same locus along with its own absolute non-existence. The opponents of the ''Advaita'' do not accept the contention that [[Ātman(Hinduism)|Atman]] is simply consciousness and cannot be the substratum of knowledge, and they insist that existence as the logical concomitant of the absence of non-existence and vice versa, with these two being mutually exclusive predicates, must be admitted. The opposite of unreality must be reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Dvaita School of Vedanta and its Literature|author=B.N.Krishnamurti Sharma|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=167|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FVtpFMPMulcC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;dq=mithyatva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gEGwUu_LFIbQ7AaH14BY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mithyatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Advaita'' anything which is both cognized and sublated is ''mithya''. ''Mithyatva'' is negated even where it is found. The illusoriness of the world is itself illusory. Once Brahman-knowledge arises both the cognizer and the cognized disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Seven Great Untenables:Sapta-viddha Anupapatti|author=John A. Grimes|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=60–62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWcgAxQnSAwC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=mithyatva+in+Advaita&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s-6wUojDO8SYtQbW0YGQBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mithyatva%20in%20Advaita&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proof of unreality is impermanence, the permanent one is the Sole Reality. ''Mithyatva'' is apparent reality; at the level of ultimate truth, when, through the understanding of the mithyatva of all limiting adjuncts (upadhis) of name and form i.e., those that pertain to the individual body-mind (''tvam'') and as well to the lordship of [[Brahman]] (''tat''), everything is seen to be not an other to pure Awareness, the distinctions of [[Jiva]] and [[Ishvara]] no longer apply, and it is the ''param Brahman'', the very essential of the Lord Itself, that is the final reality. In ''Advaita'' the method to reveal the unreality (''mithyatva'') of things involves the idea of change and permanence i.e. what deviates and what persists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Method of Early Vedanta|author=Michael Commins|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=260|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sx12hxoFVqwC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;dq=mithyatva+in+Advaita&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s-6wUojDO8SYtQbW0YGQBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mithyatva%20in%20Advaita&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mithyatva'' means 'illusoriness'. ''[[Advaita]]'' maintains that Brahman alone is real, the plurality of the universe is because the universe is illusory, the universe can be cognized; whatever that is cognized is illusory. The universe is different from the real as well as the real, the universe is indeterminable. ''Vedanta Desika'' refutes this contention because there is no such entity which is neither real nor unreal. The universe which is different from Brahman is inseparably related to Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advaita and Visistadvaita:A Study based on Vedanta Desika’s Satadusani|author=S.M.Srinivasa Chari|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=100|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=r1zNxV2zBPsC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=mithyatva+in+Advaita&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZwKxUujCJMiGtAacpoH4Cg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mithyatva%20in%20Advaita&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Badarayana]] ([[Brahma Sutra]] III.ii.28) declares that between the ''Jiva'' and Brahman there is difference as well as non-difference like the relation of light to its substratum or source on account of both being luminous, one being limited and the other all-pervading, the all-pervading is real and immortal. Rishi Damano Yamayana ([[Rig Veda]] X.xvi.4) insists that all should know about that part of the body which is immortal; the immortal part of the body is the [[Ātman (Buddhism)|Atman]] or [[Brahman]], it is called a part because without it there cannot be life in one’s body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD  Books|pages=76, 90|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Illumination_Of_Knowledge.html?id=dXZJXwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vācaspati Miśra|Vacaspati]] of the ''Bhamati'' school states that whereas illusion conceals, ''mithyatva'' signifies 'concealment', the real nature of the cognized object is concealed resulting in non-apprehension of difference between the real and the unreal objects. Padmapada of the ''Vivarna'' school adds to the sense of concealment the sense of inexpressibility, thus hinting at the sublatability of illusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhamati and Vivarna Schools of Advaita Vedanta:A Critical Approach|author=Pulasth Soobah Roodumam|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=116|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2pU2ZQB2wUYC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=mithyatva+in+Advaita&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZwKxUujCJMiGtAacpoH4Cg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mithyatva%20in%20Advaita&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the term ''anirvacaniya'' is defined by the ''Advaita'' as the nature of being different from ''sat'' and ''asat'' in essence, which is the nature of ''mithyatva'', then the element of difference must be real. Even though Jayatirtha states that there is no bar on the validity of the experience of difference, but the fact remains that difference cannot be an attribute of objects. [[Madhavacharya of Sringeri|Madhavacharya]] concludes that difference is not something that falls outside the content of an object or what is generally considered to constitute its essence which in perception is the sum total of its distinction from others. The perception of an object is the same as the perception of its difference from all others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Treasury of Mahyana Sutras|author=Chen-chi Chang|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aktdBheKI-IC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq=mithyatva+in+Advaita&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xRmxUpIsiI61Bu-wgIgC&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mithyatva%20in%20Advaita&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicholas Joseph Fuentes''' (born August 18, 1998) is an American YouTube personality and political commentator. He regularly hosts the ''America First'' podcast and formerly hosted ''Nationalist Review'', with co-host [[James Allsup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nicholasjfuentes.com/|title=Nicholas J. Fuentes|last=|first=|date=|website=Nicholas J. Fuentes.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been called [[Far-right politics|far-right]] and [[alt-right]], terms he rejects. He previously worked as a host on the [[Right Side Broadcasting Network]], but was removed after calling for violence against journalists. He later left [[Boston University]] after allegedly receiving several death threats and stated he intends to transfer to [[Auburn University]], though he has yet to confirm enrollment.

== Early life and education ==
Fuentes graduated from [[Lyons Township High School]], and was the school's student council president. He initially attended [[Boston University]], but later dropped out to attend the [[Unite the Right rally]] rally in Charlottevile, Virginia. Fuentes has stated he intends to transfer to [[Auburn University]], as it is within a staunch [[Alabama|red state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/08/alt-right_figure_says_hes_been.html|title=Alt-right figure says he's been admitted to Auburn|last=|first=|date=|website=AL.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/western-springs/news/ct-dlg-lt-grad-death-threats-tl-0824-20170818-story.html|title=Area teen rallied in Charlottesville, got death threats, now planning move to 'solidly red' Alabama|last=Mannion|first=Annemarie|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being admitted for the fall 2017 semester, he failed to confirm his enrollment and must apply for the spring semester by the deadline of October 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.al.com/opinion/index.ssf/2017/08/if_alt-rights_nicholas_fuentes.html|title=Nicholas Fuentes was admitted to Auburn in May for 2017 fall semester, school says; he must reapply for spring|last=|first=|date=|website=AL.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
On April 25, 2017, while a host on [[Right Side Broadcasting Network]], Fuentes said he wanted "the people that run [[CNN]] to be arrested, and deported or hanged" for their "malicious intent" toward the American people.&lt;ref name="Vice1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=huffpo&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/nick-fuentes-kill-globalists-at-cnn_us_58fe7e95e4b00fa7de16ed9e |title=Right-Wing Broadcaster Calls For Killing Of 'Globalists At CNN' |publisher=[[Huffpost]] |date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuentes had also stated, "the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] was not written for [[Muslim]]s". They later issued an apology claiming what he said had been "in jest".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/04/24/right-side-broadcasting-unofficial-version-trump-tv-forced-apologize-contributor-s-call-kill/216156|title=Right Side Broadcasting, The "Unofficial Version Of Trump TV," Forced To Apologize For Contributor's Call To "Kill The Globalists" At CNN|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Media Matters]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=huffpo /&gt; As a result of hidden video footage of him saying that interracial sex was "degenerate", [[Right Side Broadcasting Network|Right Side Broadcasting]] removed Fuentes as a host on their network.&lt;ref name="Vice1" /&gt;

On January 14, 2018 his ''Nationalist Review'' podcast co-host [[James Allsup]] said that the two had separated due to administrative disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://angrywhitemen.org/2018/01/15/america-first-media-dissolves-amid-a-feud-between-nick-fuentes-and-james-allsup/|title=America First Media Dissolves Amid A Feud Between Nick Fuentes And James Allsup|date=2018-01-16|work=Angry White Men|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2018|reason=Source is a blog but specific claim is non-controversial}}

On April 11, 2018, [[Heavy.com]] reported that Fuentes's YouTube channel had 11,000 subscribers, referring to him as an "America First nationalist", while covering his public disavowing of [[Paul Nehlen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://heavy.com/news/2018/04/nehlen-twitter-banned-antisemitic-white-supremacist/ |title=Paul Nehlen Controversies: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know |publisher=[[Heavy.com]] |date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a knife through one of Nehlen's campaign posters live on a podcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/not-even-white-nationalists-like-paul-nehlen-anymore/ |title=Not Even White Nationalists Like Paul Nehlen Anymore  |publisher=[[Right Wing Watch]] |date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12773">In mathematics, a '''numerical semigroup''' is a special kind of a [[semigroup]]. Its underlying [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is the set of all nonnegative [[integer]]s except a [[finite set|finite]] number  and the [[binary operation]] is the operation of  [[addition]] of integers. Also, the integer [[0 (number)|0]] must be an element of the semigroup. For example, while the set {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...} is a numerical semigroup, the set {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, ...} is not because 1 is in the set and 1 + 1 = 2 is not in the set. Numerical semigroups are [[commutative]] [[monoids]] and are also known as '''numerical monoids'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garcia-Sanchez|first=P.A.|title=Numerical semigroups minicourse|url=http://cmup.fc.up.pt/cmup/v2/include/filedb.php?id=117&amp;table=publicacoes&amp;field=file|accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Finch|first=Steven|title=Monoids of Natural Numbers|url=http://algo.inria.fr/csolve/mnd.pdf|publisher=INRIA Algorithms Project|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The definition of numerical semigroup is intimately related to the problem of determining nonnegative integers that can be expressed in the form ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; for a given set {''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;} of positive integers and for arbitrary nonnegative integers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;. This problem had been considered by several mathematicians like [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius|Frobenius]] (1849 – 1917) and [[James Joseph Sylvester|Sylvester]] (1814 – 1897) at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Rosales&gt;{{cite book|last=J.C.

== Definition and examples==
===Definition===

Let ''N'' be the set of nonnegative integers. A subset ''S'' of ''N'' is called a numerical semigroup if the following conditions are satisfied.

#0 is an element of ''S''
#''N'' &amp;minus; ''S'', the complement of ''S'' in ''N'', is finite.
#If ''x'' and ''y'' are in ''S'' then ''x + y'' is also in ''S''.

There is a simple method to construct numerical semigroups. Let ''A'' = {''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;} be a nonempty set of positive integers. The set of all integers of the form ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the subset of ''N'' generated by ''A'' and is denoted by &amp;lang; ''A'' &amp;rang;. The following theorem fully characterizes numerical semigroups.

===Theorem===

Let ''S'' be the subsemigroup of ''N'' generated by ''A''. Then ''S'' is a numerical semigroup if and only if [[Greatest common divisor|gcd]] (''A'') = 1. Moreover, every numerical semigroup arises in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=García-Sánchez|first1=J.C. Rosales, P.A.|title=Numerical semigroups|date=2009|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-0160-6|pages=7|edition=First.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===

The following subsets of ''N'' are numerical semigroups.
#&amp;lang; 1 &amp;rang; = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
#&amp;lang; 1, 2 &amp;rang; = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
#&amp;lang; 2, 3 &amp;rang; = {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...}
#Let ''a'' be a positive integer. &amp;lang; ''a'', ''a'' + 1, ''a'' + 2, ... , 2''a'' - 1  &amp;rang; = {0, ''a'', ''a'' + 1, ''a'' + 2, ''a'' + 3, ...}.
#Let ''b'' be an odd integer greater than 1. Then &amp;lang; 2, ''b'' &amp;rang; = {0, 2, 4, . . . , ''b'' − 3 , ''b'' − 1, ''b'', ''b'' + 1, ''b'' + 2, ''b'' + 3 , ...}.

==Embedding dimension, multiplicity==

The set ''A'' is a set of generators of the numerical semigroup &amp;lang; ''A'' &amp;rang;. A set of generators of a numerical semigroup is a minimal system
of generators if none of its proper subsets generates the numerical semigroup. It is known that 
every numerical semigroup ''S'' has a unique minimal system of generators and also that this minimal system of generators is finite. The cardinality of the minimal set of generators is called the ''[[embedding dimension]]'' of the numerical semigroup ''S'' and is denoted by ''e''(''S''). The smallest member in the minimal system of generators is called the ''multiplicity'' of the numerical semigroup ''S'' and is denoted by ''m''(''S'').

==Frobenius number and genus==
There are several notable numbers associated with a numerical semigroup ''S''.
# The set ''N'' &amp;minus; ''S'' is called the set of gaps in ''S'' and is denoted by ''G''(''S'').
# The number of elements in the set of gaps ''G''(''S'') is called the genus of ''S'' (or, the degree of singularity of ''S'') and is denoted by ''g''(''S'').
# The greatest element in ''G''(''S'') is called the [[Frobenius number]] of ''S'' and is denoted by ''F''(''S'').
===Examples===

Let ''S'' =  &amp;lang; 5, 7, 9 &amp;rang;. Then we have:
* The set of elements in ''S'' :  ''S'' = {0, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, ...}.
* The minimal set of generators of ''S'' : {5, 7, 9}.
* The embedding dimension of ''S'' : ''e''(''S'') = 3.
* The multiplicity of ''S'' : ''m''(''S'') = 5.
* The set of gaps in ''S'' : ''G''(''S'') = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13}. 
* The Frobenius number of ''S'' : ''F''(''S'') = 13.
* The genus of ''S'' : ''g''(''S'') = 8.

==Computation of Frobenius number==

===Numerical semigroups with embedding dimension two===


The following general results were known to Sylvester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=J. J. Sylvester|title=Mathematical questions with their solutions|journal=Educational Times|year=1884|volume=41|issue=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{badref|date=June 2016}}  Let ''a'' and ''b'' be positive integers such that [[Greatest common divisor|gcd]] (''a'', ''b'') = 1. Then 
*''F''(&amp;lang; ''a'', ''b'' &amp;rang;) = (''a'' &amp;minus; 1) (''b'' &amp;minus; 1) − 1 = ''ab'' &amp;minus; (''a'' + ''b'').
*''g''(&amp;lang; ''a'', ''b'' &amp;rang;) =  (''a'' &amp;minus; 1)(''b'' &amp;minus; 1) / 2.

===Numerical semigroups with embedding dimension three===


There is no known general formula to compute the Frobenius number of numerical semigroups having embedding dimension three or more. No polynomial formula can be found to compute the Frobenius number or genus of a numerical semigroup with embedding dimension three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=F. Curtis|title=On formulas for the Frobenius number of a numerical semigroup|journal=[[Mathematica Scandinavica]]|year=1990|volume=67|issue=2|pages=190–192|url=http://www.mscand.dk/article.php?id=1278|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every positive integer is the Frobenius number of some numerical semigroup with embedding dimension three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=J.

===Rödseth's algorithm===


The following algorithm, known as Rödseth's algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J.L. Ramírez Alfonsín|title=The Diophantine Frobenius Problem|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-856820-9|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ö.J. Rödseth|title=On a linear Diophantine problem of Frobenius|journal=[[J. Reine Angew. Math.]]|year=1978|volume=301|pages=171–178}} &lt;/ref&gt; 
can be used to compute the Frobenius number of a numerical semigroup ''S'' generated by {''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;} where  ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;   and       [[Greatest common divisor|gcd]] ( ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1.  Its worst-case complexity is not as good as Greenberg's algorithm
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harold Greenberg|title=Solution to a linear Diophantine equation for non-negative integers|journal=Journal of Algorithms|year=1988|volume=9|pages=343–353|doi=10.1016/0196-6774(88)90025-9}} &lt;/ref&gt;
but it is much simpler to describe.
*Let ''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be the unique integer such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; mod ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 0 ≤ ''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
*The continued fraction algorithm is applied to the ratio ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:
**''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; − ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 0 ≤ ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,
**''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0 ≤ ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,
**''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 0 ≤ ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,
**...
**''s''&lt;sub&gt;''m''−1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''m''+1&lt;/sub&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;,
**''s''&lt;sub&gt;''m''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0,
:where ''q''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 2, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0 for all i.
*Let ''p''&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; − ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = (''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)/''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
*Let ''v'' be the unique integer number such that ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''v''+1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 0 &lt; ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;, or equivalently, the unique integer such 
**''s''&lt;sub&gt;''v''+1&lt;/sub&gt;/''p''&lt;sub&gt;''v''+1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;  ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;/''p''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;·
*Then, ''F''(''S'') = &amp;minus;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''s''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; 1) + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''p''&lt;sub&gt;''v''+1&lt;/sub&gt; − 1) − min{''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;''v''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;}.

==Special classes of numerical semigroups==
An ''irreducible numerical semigroup'' is a numerical semigroup  such that it cannot be written as the intersection of two numerical semigroups properly containing it. A numerical semigroup ''S'' is irreducible if and only if ''S'' is maximal, with respect to set inclusion,  in the collection of all numerical semigroups  with Frobenius number ''F''(''S''). 

A numerical semigroup ''S '' is ''symmetric'' if it is irreducible and its Frobenius number ''F''(''S'') is  odd.  We say that ''S'' is ''pseudo-symmetric'' provided that ''S'' is irreducible and F(S) is even. Such numerical semigroups have simple characterizations in terms of Frobenius number and genus:
*A numerical semigroup ''S'' is symmetric if and only if ''g''(''S'') = (''F''(''S'') + 1)/2.
*A numerical semigroup ''S'' is pseudo-symmetric if and only if ''g''(''S'') = (''F''(''S'') + 2)/2.

An '''O mark''', also known as '''Marujirushi''' ({{lang|ja|丸印}}) in Japan and '''Gongpyo''' ({{lang|ko|공표}}, 공標, ball mark) in Korea, is the name of the symbol "⭕" used to represent affirmation in [[East Asia]], similar to its Western equivalent of the [[tick (check mark)|checkmark]]. Its opposite is the [[X mark]] ("✗") or ("×").

==Hanamaru==
The {{Nihongo|'''hanamaru'''|花丸}} is a variant of the O mark used in [[Japan]], written as 💮. It is typically drawn as a spiral surrounded by rounded flower petals, suggesting a flower. It is frequently used in praising or complimenting children, and the motif often appears in children's characters and logos.

The hanamaru is frequently written on tests if a student has achieved full marks or an otherwise outstanding result. Sometimes used in place of an O mark in grading written response problems if a student's answer is especially good. Some teachers will add more rotations to the spiral the better the answer is. It is also used as a symbol for good weather.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

'''''Oncorhynchus masou formosanus''''',  the '''Formosan landlocked salmon'''&lt;ref&gt;Yan HY (2000) [http://www.springerlink.com/content/q078143304260l20/fulltext.pdf Threatened fishes of the world: ''Oncorhynchus masou formosanus'' (Jordan &amp; Oshima, 1919) (Salmonidae)] ''Environmental Biology of Fishes'' 57:314.&lt;/ref&gt; or Taiwanese salmon, is a  freshwater [[salmonid]] fish [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Taiwan]].

The Formosan landlocked salmon is a subspecies of the more widespread West-Pacific [[cherry salmon]] (or masu salmon). This Taiwanese subspecies is [[critically endangered]], being at high risk for [[extinction]], and is protected in its native habitat. The Formosan land-locked salmon is one of the rarest fish in the world. Once a staple of the [[Taiwanese aborigine]] diet, there are now barely more than 400 of this type of salmon left. [[Overfishing]] has led to its decline. [[Conservationists]] are trying to save this subspecies which is threatened nowadays mainly by [[pollution]].

Formosan landlocked salmon are about a foot in length and inhabit cold, slow-flowing streams with gently sloping beds at elevations above {{convert|1500|m}}, such as the [[Chichiawan]] Stream and the [[Kaoshan Stream]] (formerly named [[Hsuehshan]] Stream/Wuling Stream) in the upper reaches of the [[Tachia River]].

The taxonomic rank of the endemic Taiwanese salmon is in dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Kottelat, M. 1996.  [http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/15323/all Oncorhynchus formosanus].   [http://www.iucnredlist.org 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. ]  Downloaded on 12 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some authors consider it not distinct from the nominate cherry salmon (''O. masou masou''), others as a regional subspecies ''O. masou formosanus'', and still others list is as a full species ''O. formosanus''.

At this time, these salmon represent the southernmost natural distribution of members of the family [[Salmonidae]] in Asia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3193">In [[mathematics]], in the field of [[topology]], a subset of a [[topological space]] is '''perfect''' if it is [[closed set|closed]] and has no [[isolated point]]s. Equivalently: the set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is perfect if  &lt;math&gt;S=S'&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of all [[Limit point|limit points]] of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, also known as the [[Derived set (mathematics)|derived set]] of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

In a perfect set, every point can be approximated arbitrarily well by other points from the set: given any point of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and any [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|topological neighborhood]] of the point, there is another point of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; that lies within the neighborhood.

Note that the term ''perfect space'' is also used, incompatibly, to refer to other properties of a topological space, such as being a [[G-delta space|G&lt;sub&gt;&amp;delta;&lt;/sub&gt; space]]. 

==Examples==

Examples of perfect subsets of the [[Real line|real line]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are: the [[empty set]], all [[Closed interval|closed intervals]], the real line itself, and the [[Cantor set]]. The latter is noteworthy in that it is [[totally disconnected]].

== Connection with other topological properties ==
[[Georg Cantor|Cantor]] proved that every closed subset of the real line can be uniquely written as the disjoint union of a perfect set and a [[countable set]].  This is also true more generally for all closed subsets of [[Polish space|Polish spaces]], in which case the theorem is known as the [[Cantor–Bendixson theorem]].

Cantor also showed that every non-empty perfect subset of the real line has cardinality &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. These results are extended in  [[descriptive set theory]] as follows:
* If ''X'' is a [[complete metric space]] with no isolated points, then the [[Cantor space]] 2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt; can be continuously embedded into ''X''. Thus ''X'' has cardinality at least &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;. If ''X'' is a [[Separable space|separable]], complete metric space with no isolated points, the cardinality of ''X'' is exactly &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;.  
* If ''X'' is a [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] with no isolated points, there is an injective function (not necessarily continuous) from Cantor space to ''X'', and so ''X'' has cardinality at least &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Nihongo|'''Poka-yoke'''|ポカヨケ||{{IPA-ja|poka joke|}}}} is a Japanese term that means "mistake-proofing" or "inadvertent error [[:wikt:prevention|prevention]]". The key word in the second translation, often omitted, is "inadvertent". There is no poka-yoke solution that protects against an operator's sabotage, but sabotage is a rare behavior among people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BcH1CwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Standardized Work with TWI: Eliminating Human Errors in Production and Service Processes|last=Misiurek|first=Bartosz|publisher=Productivity Press|year=2016|isbn=9781498737548|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poka-yoke is any mechanism in any process that helps an equipment operator avoid (''yokeru'') mistakes (''poka''). Its purpose is to eliminate product defects by preventing, correcting, or drawing attention to [[human error]]s as they occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Using Poka-Yoke Techniques for Early Defect Detection | url=http://facultyweb.berry.edu/jgrout/pokasoft.html | last= Robinson | first=Harry | year=1997 | accessdate=May 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept was formalised, and the term adopted, by [[Shigeo Shingo]] as part of the [[Toyota Production System]].&lt;ref name=Shigeo /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A Brief Tutorial on Mistake-proofing, Poka-Yoke, and ZQC | url=http://www.mistakeproofing.com/tutorial.html | author=John R. Grout, Brian T. Downs | accessdate=May 4, 2009 | publisher=MistakeProofing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally described as ''[[Baka (fool)|baka]]-yoke'', but as this means "fool-proofing" (or "[[Idiot proof|idiot-proofing]]") the name was changed to the milder ''poka-yoke''.

==Usage==
More broadly, the term can refer to any [[behavior-shaping constraint]] designed into a process to prevent incorrect operation by the user. 

A simple poka-yoke example is demonstrated when a driver of the car equipped with a manual gearbox must press on the clutch pedal (a process step, therefore a poka-yoke) prior to starting an automobile. The interlock serves to prevent unintended movement of the car. Another example of poka-yoke would be the car equipped with an automatic transmission, which has a switch that requires the car to be in "Park" or "Neutral" before the car can be started (some automatic transmissions require the brake pedal to be depressed as well). These serve as behavior-shaping constraints as the action of "car in Park (or Neutral)" or "foot depressing the clutch/brake pedal" must be performed before the car is allowed to start. The requirement of a depressed brake pedal to shift  most of the cars with an automatic transmission from "Park" to any other gear is yet another example of a poka-yoke application. Over time, the driver's behavior is conformed with the requirements by repetition and habit.

==History==
The term poka-yoke was applied by [[Shigeo Shingo]] in the 1960s to industrial processes designed to prevent human errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Using Poka-Yoke techniques for early defect detection | url=http://facultyweb.berry.edu/jgrout/pokasoft.html | author=H Robinson | accessdate=June 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shingo redesigned a process in which factory workers, while assembling a small switch, would often forget to insert the required spring under one of the switch buttons. In the redesigned process, the worker would perform the task in two steps, first preparing the two required springs and placing them in a placeholder, then inserting the springs from the placeholder into the switch. When a spring remained in the placeholder, the workers knew that they had forgotten to insert it and could correct the mistake effortlessly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= The Sayings of Shigeo Shingo: Key Strategies for Plant Improvement | url=http://www.qualitycoach.net/products/the-sayings-of-shigeo-shingo-key-strategies-f.asp | accessdate=August 20, 2012 | publisher=QualityCoach.Net }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shingo distinguished between the concepts of inevitable human [[Error|mistake]]s and [[Product defect|defect]]s in the production. Defects occur when the mistakes are allowed to reach the customer. The aim of poka-yoke is to design the process so that mistakes can be detected and corrected immediately, eliminating defects at the source.

== Implementation in manufacturing ==
Poka-yoke can be implemented at any step of a manufacturing process where something can go wrong or an error can be made.&lt;ref name=qualityportal&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thequalityportal.com/pokayoke.htm | title=Poka Yoke or Mistake Proofing :: Overview | publisher=The Quality Portal | accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a [[fixture (tool)|fixture]] that holds pieces for processing might be modified to only allow pieces to be held in the correct orientation,&lt;ref name="NKS"&gt;{{cite book |author = Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun |authorlink=Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun |title=Poka-yoke: improving product quality by preventing defects |publisher=Productivity Press |year=1988 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hR_8Ulz6d_oC&amp;pg=PA111 111] |isbn=978-0-915299-31-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a digital counter might track the number of spot welds on each piece to ensure that the worker executes the correct number of welds.&lt;ref name="NKS" /&gt;

Shigeo Shingo recognized three types of poka-yoke for detecting and preventing errors in a [[mass production]] system:&lt;ref name=Shigeo&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Shigeo | last1 = Shingo |authorlink=Shigeo Shingo  | first2 = Andrew  | last2 = Dillon |title=A study of the Toyota production system from an industrial engineering viewpoint |publisher = Productivity Press | location = Portland, OR |year=1989 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=RKWU7WElJ7oC&amp;pg=PA22 | isbn = 0-915299-17-8 |oclc=19740349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=qualityportal /&gt;

# The ''contact'' method identifies product defects by testing the product's shape, size, color, or other physical attributes.
# The ''fixed-value'' (or ''constant number'') method alerts the operator if a certain number of movements are not made.
# The ''motion-step'' (or ''sequence'') method determines whether the prescribed steps of the process have been followed.

Either the operator is alerted when a mistake is about to be made, or the poka-yoke device actually prevents the mistake from being made. In Shingo's lexicon, the former implementation would be called a ''warning'' poka-yoke, while the latter would be referred to as a ''control'' poka-yoke.&lt;ref name="Shigeo" /&gt;

Shingo argued that errors are inevitable in any [[manufacturing]] process, but that if appropriate poka-yokes are implemented, then mistakes can be caught quickly and prevented from resulting in defects. By eliminating defects at the source, the cost of mistakes within a company is reduced.{{citation needed|date = June 2013}}

A methodic approach to build up poka-yoke countermeasures has been proposed by the Applied Problem Solving (APS) methodology,&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Fantin (2014). Applied Problem Solving. Method, Applications, Root Causes, Countermeasures, Poka-Yoke and A3. How to make things happen to solve problems. Milan, Italy: Createspace, an Amazon company. {{ISBN|978-1499122282}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consists of a three-step analysis of the risks to be managed:
# Identification of the need
# Identification of possible mistakes
# Management of mistakes before satisfying the need
This approach can be used to [[Murphy's law|emphasize]] the technical aspect of finding effective solutions during brainstorming sessions.

== Benefits of poka-yoke implementation ==
A typical feature of poka-yoke solutions is that they don't let an error in a process happen. But that is just one of their advantages. Others include:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Less time spent on training workers;
* Elimination of many operations related to [[quality control]];
* Unburdening of operators from repetitive operations;
* Promotion of the work improvement-oriented approach and actions;
* A reduced number of rejects;
* Immediate action when a problem occurs;
* 100% built-in [[quality control]].

==Development and studies on the theory==

===Geert Hofstede===

====Cultural dimensions theory====
Hofstede, the famous business anthropologist, developed the [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|cultural dimensions theory]], used widely as a crucial framework for cross-cultural communication. It is the earliest theory that could be quantified and used to explain perceived differences between cultures and has been applied extensively in many fields, especially in cross-cultural psychology, international business, and cross-cultural communication. It was driven by the statistical procedure (also called 'factor analysis') to make the development, based on the result of a global survey of the values of IBM employees conducted  from 1967 and 1973. Hofstede's theory identified six dimensions of culture, which are power distance, individualism vs collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity vs femininity, short-term vs long-term orientation, and indulgence vs self-restraint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = An Interview with Geert Hofstede|last = Hoppe|first = Michael|date = Feb 2004|journal = The Academy of Management Executive (1993–2005)|volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=75–79|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Power Distance Index (PDI) ====
The Power Distance Index is designed to measure 'the extent to which power differs within the society, organization and institutions (like the family) are accepted by the less powerful members'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Hofstede|first = Geert H.|year = 1997|title = Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind |edition=second |location = New York |publisher = McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-707474-6|page= 27}} Originally published in 1991 as ''Cultures and organizations: software of the mind: intercultural cooperation and its importance for survival''.&lt;/ref&gt; It indicates the level of power distance and dependent relationships in a country by assigning a score to each country. The PDI also represents society's level of inequality that is defined from below rather than from above. As Hofstede stressed, there is no absolute value and PDI is useful only as a method to compare countries.&lt;ref name="Velo-26"&gt;{{harvnb|Velo|2011|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofstede derived the power distance scores for three regions and fifty countries from the answers given by IBM employees in the same type of positions to the same questions. The detailed steps to calculate the PDI is as follows:

1. Prepare three survey questions:
* How frequently, in their experience, are they afraid to express disagreement with their managers? (mean score on a 1-5 scale from &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;very frequently' to 'very seldom')&lt;ref name="GHH-25"&gt;{{harvnb|Hofstede|1997|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subordinates' perception of their boss's actual decision-making style (percentage choosing either the description of an autocratic or of a paternalistic style, out of four possible styles plus a 'none of these alternatives')&lt;ref name="GHH-25" /&gt;
* Subordinates' preference for their boss's decision-making style (percentage preferring an autocratic or a paternalistic style, or, on the contrary, as type based on majority vote, but not a consultative style)&lt;ref name="GHH-25" /&gt;
2. Pre-code the answers so that they are represented by a number (e.g. 1,2,3,4...)

3. Compute the mean score for the answers of equal sample of people from each country or percentage for choosing particular answers

4. Sort the questions into groups which are called clusters or factors by using a statistical procedure

5. Add or subtract the three scores after multiplying each with a fixed number

6. Add another fixed number
* '''Lower PDI Culture: '''Low PDI cultures: In lower PDI cultures, the emotional distance is relatively small. There are more democratic or consultative relations between expecting and accepting power. People are relatively interdependent to the power holders, and there is relatively low inequality of power distributed among the people. Under these circumstances, the decentralized authority and flat management structure is common though not universal. It means that both managers and subordinates will, on average, be relatively less concerned with status, and the distribution of decision-making responsibility is extensive. Thus, the 'open door' policy is more easily used then elsewhere, which means the individuals in superior positions are not only more likely to be open to listen to those in inferior positions, but subordinates are also more likely to be willing to challenge or give suggestions to their superiors. For example, in this culture, if one wants to get a promotion, one would prefer to get their ideas across to their boss directly. Examples of countries with low PDI are the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and the Nordic countries.&lt;ref name="Smit"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Smit, Chris |date=26 April 2012 |title = Power Distance or PDI|url = http://culturematters.com/power-distance-or-pdi/|website = culturematters.com|accessdate =14 September 2015}} (self-published)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''High PDI Cultures:''' These are cultures in which the power relations are paternalistic and autocratic, and where there is centralized authority. In other words, there is a wide gap or emotional distance which is perceived to exist among people at different levels of the hierarchy. There is considerable dependence of people on power holders, which, in psychology, is known as counter-dependence (denounce, but with negative sign). In the workplace, the subordinates are willing to accept their inferior positions. The boss, in turn, may be not asked for broad participation in the process of decision making. Thus, unlike in lower PDI cultures, the 'open door' policy has been replaced by an autocratic leadership style, which means subordinates may be unlikely to approach and contradict their bosses directly.&lt;ref name="GHH-25" /&gt; For instance, even though employees may want to be promoted, it is entirely their boss's decision and they have no say in it.  Generally, countries with high power distance cultures hold that there is nothing wrong with inequality and thus, everyone could be in specific positions. Additionally, people in higher positions  usually display and promote the use of status symbols: powerful individuals would not eat lunch at the same cafeteria as people in lower positions, and there are large numbers of supervisors who are entitled to special privileges, for example. Belgium, France, Malaysia, and the Arab World can be regarded as examples of countries or regions with high PDI cultures.&lt;ref name="Smit" /&gt;

==== Limitation of Hofstede's model on power distance ====
Hofstede's study made a great contribution to the establishment of the research tradition in cross-cultural psychology. However, limitations still exist.

Firstly, each stage of the research process reappears as a political act of neutralization—of making the unneutral seem neutral. The questionnaire reflects a large power distance: its questions were explicitly designed to resolve the normative concerns of researchers. To further explain, it primarily served the concerns of those who needed to do comparative analysis and created it through "coercing a culturally distinct axis of comparison" on a variety of employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Ailon|first = Galit|year=2008 |title =Mirror, Mirror on the Wall: Culture's consequences in a value test of its own design|journal = Academy of Management Review |doi=10.2307/20159451 |jstor=20159451 |volume=33 |pages=885–904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, the questionnaire adopted an obviously western methodology to analyze non-western countries and it is also relatively selective in representing the inequality within the western countries. For example, the PDI concentrated on the boss and subordinate relationship, which could be seen as biased, as it ignores other forms of western inequality. Apparently, the questions failed to measure  the racial, colonial, and broader class inequalities which should be taken into account into the  measurement of power distance.

In the middle of the last century, Haire, Ghiselli, and Porter&lt;ref name="Haire"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haire|first1=Mason|last2=Ghiselli|first2=Edwin E. |last3=Porter|first3=Lyman W. |title=Managerial Thinking: An international study |series=Research program of the Institute of Industrial Relations, University of California |publisher=Wiley|location=New York |oclc=925871372}}&lt;/ref&gt; explored the differences in preferences for power among different cultures with remarkable outcomes, even though they did not mention the concept of power distance. The methodology they adopted was by questionnaire, which was based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs with some modification. The aim of the questionnaire was to evaluate how managers from 14 countries were satisfied regarding their needs when they were in their current positions. The dimensions that were linked to power distance across cultures in their questionnaire were autonomy and self-actualization.
Autonomy
* The authority that comes with their management position.
* The degree to which independent thinking and action are allowed in their management positions.

Self-Actualization
* The chance for personal progress and advancement in management positions.
* The sense of self-achievement one derives from being in a management position.
* The sense of achievement from being in a management position.

In accordance with the responses to the questions in their questionnaire, the 14 countries were clustered into five main groups, which they labeled Nordic-European (Denmark, Germany, Norway, and Sweden), Latin-European (Belgium, France, Italy, and Spain), Anglo-American (England and the United States), Developing (Argentina, Chile, and India), and Japan (by itself). One important thing from this analysis is the various mean standardized scores that the five groups presented with respect to autonomy and self-actualization. For these figures, positive ones mean greater satisfaction of need than for the average manager across all 14 countries, while negative ones mean lesser satisfaction. Their results are presented in Table 1.

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
|{{harvnb|Haire|1966}} || Autonomy || Self-Actualization

| Latin European || -.16 || .23
|-
| Anglo American || -.14 || -.09
|-
| Developing || -.25 || -.11
|-
| Japan || -.25 || -.11
|}

Upon the figures listed in the table, some implications are drawn. They are complicated, and summarized as follows:
– Nordic-Europeans who were surveyed were extremely contented with the satisfaction of their desire for power;
– Anglo-Americans were rather discontented; and
– the other clusters desired more power than they currently had in their positions

One important implication from this study is that countries can be clustered according to their preference for power. Besides this, some of their differences can be explained by the influence of the following factors: the predominant religion or philosophy, an established tradition of democracy, the long-term existence of a middle class, and the proportion of immigrants in each country.

=====Mulder=====
Another major study of power distance was the one that was undertaken by Mauk Mulder.&lt;ref name="Mulder"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Mulder|first1=Mauk |year=1977 |title=The Daily Power Game |series=International series on the quality of working life |publisher=Martinus Nihoff Social Sciences Division|location=Leiden, the Netherlands |isbn=978-1-4684-6953-0 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-6951-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the premise that as societies become weaker in power distance, the underprivileged will tend to reject their power dependency. Mulder's laboratory experiments in the social and organizational context of the Netherlands, a low power distance culture, concluded that people attempted to seek “power distance reduction”.&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt; He found that:
# More privileged individuals tend to try to preserve or to broaden their power distance from  subordinates.
# The larger their power distance is from a subordinate, the more the power holder would try to increase that distance.
# Less powerful individuals try to decrease the power distance between themselves and their superiors.
# The smaller the power distance, the more likely is the occurrence of less powerful individuals trying to reduce that distance.

From these findings, he concluded that a condition of quasi-equilibrium had arisen. In this condition, power holders have achieved a certain distance from people who lack power, and this distance is hard for the powerless to bridge.

====After Hofstede – The GLOBE Study====
Following Hofstede,&lt;ref name="Hofstede-2001"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Hofstede|first1=Geert H. |year=2001 |title=Culture's consequences: Comparing values, behaviours, institutions and organisations across nations |publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, California |edition=second |isbn=978-0-8039-7323-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the GLOBE project defined "power distance" as “the degree to which members of an organization or society expect and agree that power should be shared unequally.”&lt;ref&gt;Note that this is different from the definition of "power distance" used by other authors, see {{harvnb|Mulder|1977}}, as the relative difference in power between the powerful and the powerless.&lt;/ref&gt; Power distance was then further analyzed as one of the nine cultural dimensions explained in the “Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness” (GLOBE) Research Program, which was conceived in 1990 by Robert J. House of the Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=House|first1=Robert J.|last2=Hanges|first2=Paul J. |last3=Javidan|first3=Mansour|last4=Dorfman|first4=Peter W.|last5=Gupta|first5=Vipin |year=2004 |title=Culture, Leadership, and Organizations The GLOBE Study of 62 Societies|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=978-0-7619-2401-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the major premise that leader effectiveness is contextual, the research was conducted by believing that the social and organizational values, norms and beliefs of those who are being led are closely connected to the effectiveness of the leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoppe|first1=Michael H. |year=2007 |title=Culture and Leader Effectiveness: The GLOBE Study |url=http://www.inspireimagineinnovate.com/pdf/globesummary-by-michael-h-hoppe.pdf|website=Inspire!Image!Innovate!|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLOBE measures the practices and values that exist at the levels of industry (financial services, food processing, telecommunications), organization (several in each industry), and society (62 cultures).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|House|2004|page=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results are presented in the form of quantitative data based on responses of about 17,000 managers from 951 organizations functioning in 62 societies throughout the world, which shows how each of the 62 societies scores on nine major attributes of cultures, including Power Distance, and six major global leader behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|House|2004|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding power distance, GLOBE researches cultural influences on power distance values, practices and other aspects, including 'Roots of Power Distance', 'The Psychological Stream and Power' and 'The Cross-Cultural Stream and Power Distance'. It also investigates how family power values are taught, and makes a comparison of high versus low power distance societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|House|2004|page=513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When discussing 'The Cross-Cultural Stream and Power Distance', four primary factors affecting a society's level of power distance are explained separately, and they are the predominant religion or philosophy, the tradition of democratic principles of government, the existence of a strong middle class, and the proportion of immigrants in a society's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|House|2004|page=518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the four fundamental phenomena, there always exists connections; however, it is concluded that a society's main beliefs, values, and religion, will have the strongest and longest lasting influence on power distance. Then, this will be moderated by a democratic tradition and the existence of a strong middle class to some extent. Moreover, the two factors are both expected to affect narrowing power distance. Therefore, for a Roman Catholic society, which is exposed to democracy and a middle class, would be on the way to narrowing power distance. Though its level of power distance could be reduced over time, it would still be higher than a Protestant country, which has a democratic tradition and a large middle class. Finally, a large proportion of immigrants in a given society makes the low power distance trend stronger in all circumstances presented above. In addition, it is concluded that regardless of religion, any society that does not have a tradition of democracy or a significant middle class will have a substantially high power distance levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|House|2004|page=526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications and effects ==
Power distance is such a significant dimension in cross-cultural environments that it is unconsciously influencing people's behaviour in different countries, which contributes to so–called 'cultural norms'. These 'cultural norms', shaped by perceptions and acceptance of power inequality to a certain degree, lead to various reactions when facing same situations or in the same environment. However, there are some consequences resulting from acquiescence in inequality in organizations and societies, especially for high power distance countries.&lt;ref name="Ji" /&gt;

=== The workplace ===

==== Effects on management style ====
In organisations with high power distance, employees acknowledge their lesser standing, and are respectful and submissive towards their superiors; who in turn, are more likely to give orders rather than consult with their employees while making decisions. Status symbols are often displayed and flaunted. Employers or managers would not have meals together with their subordinates, and might have private facilities such as rooms, parking lots, and elevators. Having a high level of education is important to climb the corporate ladder, and the higher-ranking members of the organization are often paid much more than their employees in comparison with companies with lower power distance.&lt;ref name="Velo"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Veronica|last=Velo |year = 2011|title = Cross-Cultural Management |location = New York |publisher = Business Expert Press |isbn = 978-1-60649-350-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in businesses with low power distance, bosses are not as concerned with status symbols and would be more open to employee discussion and participation. Employees are less submissive to their superiors, and are more likely to make themselves heard or to challenge the management.&lt;ref name="Velo" /&gt;

==== Effects on employees' behaviour of help seeking ====
In high power distance regions, people in the higher positions hold great amounts of power with little challenge. The hierarchy and authority empower employers and supervisors with more rights of resource allocation, rewards and punishment, which in turn reinforce their status, as well as enable them to lead and guide their subordinates autocratically. The hierarchical differentiation between the top and the bottom gradually creates an invisible gap in the workplace, where the subordinates tend to build greater sensitivity and cautiousness when communicating with their supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kirkman B. L. |author2=Chen G. |author3=Farh J.-L. |author4=Chen Z. X. |author5=Lowe K.

It is a common phenomenon that junior employees turn to their seniors for help and advice when getting into a new environment. Yet, some researchers recently attested that employees and junior staff from high power distance countries are less likely to seek help from their supervisors.&lt;ref name="Ji" /&gt; One of the reasons is that lower ranking staff have few chances and time to meet the high ranking managers in person. The hierarchical system is far more sophisticated and restricted that subordinates are usually only able to reach their immediate supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Lonner|first1=Walter J. |last2=Berry |first2=John W. |last3=Hofstede |first3=Geert H. |year=1980 |title=Culture's Consequences: International Differences in Work-Related Values |publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's Academy for Entrepreneurial Leadership Historical Research Reference in Entrepreneurship }} [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1496209 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is widely believed that the action of asking for help is equivalent to incompetence or lack of ability, which subdues themselves into an unfavourable circumstance. What is worse is that some of the supervisors who are incapable of solving more complicated problems will become suspicious of his or her subordinates, regarding the problems as a challenge to their status and capabilities, or even as humiliation from the lower ranking staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee |first=Fiona |year=2002 |title=The Social Costs of Seeking Help |journal=The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=17–35 |doi=10.1177/0021886302381002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such climates have gradually reinforced employees to think that it is more effective and efficient to deal with difficulties by themselves, rather than talking to their managers. The indisputability of power and authority widens the gap between different levels, while the acceptance of inequality consolidates the endurance among the bottom, stopping the subordinates seeking help from the top.

There is another main perspective that leads to a larger gap between the supervisors and subordinates. In a high power distance environment, supervisors tend to pay more attention on tasks rather than human beings that are the main focus for supervisors in a low power distance environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bochner S. |author2=Hesketh B. | year = 1994 | title = Power distance, individualism/collectivism, and job-related attitudes in a culturally diverse work group | url = http://doi.org/czwm4x | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 233–257 | doi=10.1177/0022022194252005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently, task orientation emphasizes heavily on daily work completion and performance efficiency, yet the top-bottom relationship grows far more slowly since there is a lack of communication beyond work, which in turn reduces subordinates' willingness of seeking help from supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Madlock P. E. | year = 2012 | title = The influence of power distance and communication on Mexican workers | url = http://doi.org/3d2 | journal = International Journal of Business Communication | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 169–184 | doi=10.1177/0021943612436973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to low power distance countries, equality is embraced by the society that power is minimized to a large extent, where authority and hierarchy are not highlighted and supervisors are accessible and willing to build close relationship with subordinates, whose worries of any harm are turned down when seeking help from the top.&lt;ref name="Ji"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Ji, Yang |author2=Zhou, Erhua |author3=Li, Caiyun |author4=Yan, Yanling  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2015 |title=Power Distance Orientation and Employee Help Seeking: Trust in Supervisor as a Mediator |journal=Social Behaviour &amp; Personality: An International Journal |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1043–1054 |doi=10.2224/sbp.2015.43.6.1043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In charitable behaviour ===
According to research, people from high power distance countries are generally less responsible towards charitable behaviours than people from low power distance countries.&lt;ref name="Winterich"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Winterich, Karen Page  |author2=Zhang, Yinlong  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2014 |title= Accepting Inequality Deters Responsibility: How Power Distance Decreases Charitable Behavior |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=274–293 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karen_Winterich/publication/262403906_Accepting_Inequality_Deters_Responsibility_How_Power_Distance_Decreases_Charitable_Behavior/links/0c9605379fd62f31c2000000.pdf |subscription=yes |doi=10.1086/675927 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation for this phenomenon is that the rooted perception and acceptance of inequality somehow blinds their eyes to any unfair or inappropriate situations, which they may consider as a normal social circumstance and simply accept it rather than making a change.&lt;ref name="Cummings"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Cummings, William H. |author2=Venkatesan, M.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1976 |title=Cognitive Dissonance and Consumer Behavior: A Review of the Evidence |journal=Journal of Marketing Research |volume=13 |issue=3  |pages=303–308 |jstor=3150746 |doi=10.2307/3150746 }} republished from {{Cite book|author1=Cummings, William H. |author2=Venkatesan, M.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1975 |chapter=Cognitive Dissonance and Consumer Behavior: A Review of the Evidence |title=Advances in Consumer Research, Volume 2 |editor=Schlinger, Mary Jane |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan |publisher=Association for Consumer Research|pages=21–32 |url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=5742 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Festinger"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Festinger Leon |author2=Carlsmith James M | year = 1959 | title = Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 203–210 | doi=10.1037/h0041593}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cumulatively, the more inequality they accept, the less inconformity they will notice, and the less responsibilities they will take eventually. The consequence is high power distance enlarging the gap between human beings in terms of relations and wealth conditions. Conversely, people in low power distance countries are more sensitive towards any unequal phenomena. Their unacceptance of dissonance endows them with a greater sense of responsibility for adjusting or correcting the problems in person.&lt;ref name="Cummings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Festinger" /&gt;

==== Influence of controllable/uncontrollable needs ====
The types of needs are influencing people's charitable behaviour regardless of their power distance backgrounds. The needs generated are classified into controllable and uncontrollable categories, where the occurrence of the former is due to lack of effort while the occurrence of the latter is due to unforeseeable events such as natural disasters. The ability of whether individuals are able to control the situations affects how they will react to the raising needs.&lt;ref name="Betancourt"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Betancourt |first=Hector |year=1990 |title=An Attribution–Empathy Model of Helping Behavior: Behavioral Intentions and Judgments of Help-Giving |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=573–591|doi=10.1177/0146167290163015 |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Brickman, Philip |author2=Rabinowitz, Vita Carulli |author3=Karuza, Jurgis, Jr. |author4=Coates, Dan |author5=Cohn, Ellen |author6=Kidder, Louise  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1982 |title=Models of Helping and Coping |journal=American Psychologist |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=368–384 |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.37.4.368}} [http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ262702 ERIC number EJ262702]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shaver, Kelly G. |year=1985 |title=The Attribution of Blame: Causality, Responsibility, and Blameworthiness |location=New York |publisher=Springer Verlag|isbn=978-0-387-96120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the one hand, the level of power distance does have an influence over a society's reaction towards controllable needs. People with high power distance background perceive most of the issues as rightful inequality, hence are reluctant to get themselves involved with 'troubles', and therefore most of the time they choose to turn a blind eye on such petty things. Conversely, low power distance societies are intolerant with unfairness and thus their higher sense of responsibility motivates people to make an effort in eliminating dissonance in every possibility.&lt;ref name="Winterich" /&gt; Yet, there seems to be an exception. It is found that people are not sympathetic at all to those in trouble due to internal-controllable reasons. In other words, it is most likely that people reckon those who are lazy, careless, greedy or indulgent, deserve such hardship and punishment, instead of giving a hand to them to go through the difficulties.&lt;ref name="Skitka"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Skitka, Linda J. |author2=Tetlock, Philip E.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1992 |title=Allocating Scarce Resources: A Contingency Model of Distributive Justice |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=491–522 |doi=10.1016/0022-1031(92)90043-J}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this situation, even if there is an evident unequal phenomenon emerging, the willingness of charitable behaviours are attenuated to the least in both high and low power distance countries.

On the other hand, people tend to be more responsible in terms of uncontrollable needs, whereby they are more willing to offer aid to. It is assumed that people consider that the aid for uncontrollable needs will not greatly change societal rightful inequality, and hence generous assistance and help will be offered to those in need regardless of power distance background.&lt;ref name="Betancourt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skitka" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Karasawa"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Karasawa, Kaori |year=1991 |title=The Effects of Onset and Offset Responsibility on Affects and Helping Judgments |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=482–499 |doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1991.tb00532.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lerner Melvin J. |author2=Reavy Patricia | year = 1975 | title = Locus of Control, Perceived Responsibility for Prior Fate, and Helping Behavior | url = | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 1–20 | doi=10.1016/0092-6566(75)90029-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such circumstances, a sense of duty is more likely to be raised, where people tend to undertake charitable behaviours.&lt;ref name="Winterich" /&gt;

==== Influence of communal/exchange relationship norms ====
The relationship norms behind the needs also affect the sense of responsibility. The types of relationships are mainly classified as exchange relationships, in which people are expecting a reasonable privilege or benefit in return for offering aid; and communal relationships, where those giving assistance are wholeheartedly and generously taking care of those in need without any expectation of material return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Aggarwal Pankaj |author2=Law Sharmistha | year = 2005 | title = Role of Relationship Norms in Processing Brand Information | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 453–64 | doi=10.1086/497557}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Clark, Margaret S. |author2=Ouellette, Robert |author3=Powell, Martha C. |author4=Milberg, Sandra  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1987 |title=Recipient's Mood, Relationship Type, and Helping |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=94–103 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.53.1.94 |pmid=3612495 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research, people are more likely to refuse to aid when encountering needs associated with exchange relationships rather than needs with communal relationships, which has proved to alleviate the influence of power distance belief and increase the willingness and responsibility of assistance.&lt;ref name="Winterich" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Brockner, Joel |author2=Paruchuri, Srikanth |author3=Idson, Lorraine Chen |author4=Higgins, E.

Therefore, Winterich recommended that charitable organizations in high power distance countries should stress the significance of uncontrollable needs or salient communal relationship norms, through which the populace are more easily motivated to make a difference on social inequality.&lt;ref name="Winterich" /&gt;

=== Examples of cultures with high and low power distance ===
Malaysia has one of the highest levels of power distance, with a score of 100 on Hofstede's Power Distance Index (PDI).&lt;ref name="GH-2"&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2015|reason=The Geert-hofstede.com ''website cannot be used as a reference.

They would perceive hierarchy in organisations as mirroring intrinsic inequalities. Leaders are expected to be autocratic, and to instruct their subordinates on what to do. Malaysian society is often centralised, and opposition to authority is generally not welcomed.&lt;ref name="GH-2" /&gt;

With a PDI score of 11, Austria is one of the countries with the lowest levels of power distance. Austrians believe in independence, equal rights, approachable leaders, that chain of command should only be for convenience, and that supervision should facilitate and empower. Power is typically decentralised, with leaders often consulting or relying on their subordinates. First names are usually used even with superiors, and communication is direct and two-way.&lt;ref name="GH-3"&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2015|reason=The Geert-hofstede.com ''website cannot be used as a reference.

== Linked factors ==

=== Climate ===

It has been hypothesized that there is a link between climate and power distance, with societies in warmer climates more likely to have a higher power distance than societies in colder climates. As food and other necessities are relatively easier to come by in warm, comfortable climates, survival is not as difficult, and thus there is no need for rigorous discipline, preparation, or hardship. It has been argued that these conditions would give rise to a situation whereby it is beneficial for strict organisation and direction to come from superiors in order to propel people to cooperate effectively, even if it goes against the will of some people.&lt;ref name="Velo" /&gt;

On the other hand, in colder, harsher climates, it is imperative for individuals to have discipline and prudence to work hard and make the right decisions in order to survive. In these societies, if one were to be lazy and rest for a day instead of searching for food, they might not be able to survive. Therefore, self-discipline and restraint is paramount in these climates. With these qualities ingrained in the people, social order does not need to be enforced externally.&lt;ref name="Velo" /&gt;

=== Democracy ===

It has been asserted that democratic governments occur most commonly among low power distance societies, where it is not ingrained into the minds of the people since young age that there are unquestionable hierarchies in life that should not be disputed. It has been found that the 'ideological breach between labour and conservatives' is exceedingly polarised in high power distance socieites, while in low power distance cultures, people would tend to try to attain balance between the two extremes in order to avoid damaging and draining conflicts. This is why unions in high power distance cultures are usually formed by corporations or governments, while those in lower power distance societies are usually less 'ideological' and more 'practical'.&lt;ref name="Velo" /&gt;

'''Preventive repression''' is [[political repression]] of political opponents before they actually carry out any activities that would threaten the current political system. The term was used to describe the political methods of the [[Paraguay]] ''[[caudillo]]'' [[Stroessner]], whose methods of "nipping in the bud" the possibilities of any real or imagined unrest were reported at a 1972 Inter-American Defense Board meeting of US and Latin American military.  &lt;ref&gt;James D.  Cockcroft, "Paraguay's Stroessner: An Ultimate Caudillo?", in:  [https://books.google.com/books?id=eVfrobeHtz0C&amp;pg=PA340&amp;lpg=PA340&amp;dq=%22preventive+repression%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7Qt1UlTGoL&amp;sig=wc2AEeaD1HSiWQ7EXbQ8rjQ-EWA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result p. 340]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Marcuse]], in his work ''[[Counterrevolution and Revolt]]'' operates with the term  "preventive counterrevolution".

Since then, the term has been used to describe actions of other dictatorships.

'''Psychological theories of magic''' treat magic as a personal phenomenon intended to meet individual needs, as opposed to a social phenomenon serving a collective purpose.  

==Theories==
===Psychosis===

Among the earliest psychological theories is the psychosis theory, advanced by [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S.  Totem and taboo: Resemblances between the psychic lives of savages and neurotics.  London: Routledge Kegan Paul (1960).  (Original work published 1913).&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, “primitive man” is not a rational being, and in fact [[magical thinking]] bears a strong resemblance to neuroses. However, this conclusion has come into question, as more recent psychological theory acknowledges that psychological testing does not cross cultures with complete accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Gleitman, H., Reisberg, D., &amp; Gross, J.  Psychology, 7th edition.  New York, NY: W. W. Norton &amp; Co (2007). &lt;/ref&gt; 

===Bad science===
In contrast, the “bad science” model claims that primitive man is rational, and magical beliefs come into existence as he tries to explain puzzling phenomena without enough information.  According to this theory, the magician is an early form of scientist who merely lacks adequate data.  In [[Edward Burnett Tylor]]’s version of this theory, the magician’s folly is in mistaking an ideal connection for a real one; the magician believes that thematically-linked items can influence one another by virtue of their similarity.&lt;ref&gt;Evans-Pritchard, E.E.  Theories of Primitive Religion.  Oxford: Oxford University Press (1977), p.p. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Azande]] rub crocodile teeth on banana plants to make them fruitful (because crocodile teeth grow continuously).  The property of [[fertility]] can spread from a symbol of fertility (the crocodile tooth) to the intended target (the banana tree).  Michael F. Brown observes that many Aguaruna taboos can be understood as preventing undesired connections. 

===Symbolic action===
The symbolic action theory understands magic as a course of action taken when there exists an emotional (psychological) need for action, but no practical option exists. In [[R.R. Marett]]’s example, it is a magical action when a man, betrayed by his mistress, gathers photographs of her and burns them.&lt;ref&gt;R.R. Marett.  The Threshold of Religion, 2nd edition.  (1914).  Summary courtesy of Evans-Pritchard, Theories of Primitive Religion, p.p. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation presents a modern analog of the [[voodoo doll]].  As Marett describes, if the emotional situation proves common enough, the response becomes a socially-codified norm which outsiders understand as magic and which Marett labels “developed magic”.  Claude Lévi-Strauss&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. ''The Effectiveness of Symbols.''&lt;/ref&gt; and Ariel Glucklich&lt;ref&gt;Glucklich, Ariel. ''The End of Magic.'' New York: Oxford University Press (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; expand upon symbolic theory, positing that magic can serve as a form of psychotherapy or [[New Age]] science,  accomplishing real results by what amounts to the [[placebo effect]]. The effects of such magic would be made real through its effect on the individual person as demonstrated in their life and actions.

===Anxiety relief===
According to theories of anxiety relief and control, people turn to magical beliefs when there exists a sense of uncertainty and potential danger and little to do about it.  Magic is used to restore a sense of control.  In support of this theory, research indicates that superstitious behavior is invoked more often in high stress situations, especially by people with a greater desire for control.&lt;ref&gt;Keinan, Giora.  ''The effects of stress and desire for control on superstitious behavior.'' Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin Vol. 28, No. 1.  Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc. (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that one reason (but not necessarily the only reason) for the persistence of magic rituals is that the ritual activates vigilance-precaution systems – that is to say, that the rituals prompt their own use by creating a feeling of insecurity and then proposing themselves as precautions.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Pascal and Pierre Liénard.  ''Ritual behavior in obsessive and normal individuals.''  Association for Psychological Science (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pascal Boyer]] and Pierre Liénard propose that the shape rituals take results from goal demotion and attentional focus on lower level representation.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Pascal and Pierre Liénard.  ''Ritual behavior in obsessive and normal individuals.''  Association for Psychological Science (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Levels of representation were previously described by J.M. Zacks and [[Barbara Tversky]].&lt;ref&gt;Zacks, J.M. and B. Tversky.  ''Event structure in perception and conception.''  Psychological Bulletin, 127, 3-21.  (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; At the lowest level are simple gestures (such as putting the left foot in a shoe).  At the mid-level are behavioral episodes (such as putting one’s shoes on). At the highest level are scripts (such as getting dressed to go out). Ordinarily, people describe and recall behavior in terms of the middle level of behavioral episodes{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}.  In studies of [[obsessive-compulsive]] rituals, focus shifts to the lower level of gestures, resulting in goal demotion. For example, an obsessive-compulsive cleaning ritual may overemphasize the order, direction, and number of wipes used to clean the surface.  The goal becomes less important than the actions used to achieve the goal, with the implication that magic rituals can persist without efficacy because the intent is lost within the act. Debate remains as to whether studies of obsessive-compulsive rituals can be extended to describe other kinds of rituals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20098">The '''involvement of the public in patent examination''' is used in some forms to help identifying relevant [[prior art]] and, more generally, to help assessing whether [[patent application]]s and [[invention]]s meet the requirements of [[patent|patent law]], such as [[novelty (patent)|novelty]], [[inventive step and non-obviousness|inventive step or non-obviousness]], and [[sufficiency of disclosure]].

==Rationale==
The rationale for [[public participation]] in patent-application reviews is that knowledgeable persons in fields that are relevant to a particular patent application will provide useful information to [[patent examiner]]s if the proper forum is provided.  One model for such a forum is a [[wiki]] model where the public may submit the prior art and commentary that are relevant to a given patent application, and patent examiners can consult that forum. The intended effect is that patent examination will be more efficient and thorough so that the patents that are issued will be of a higher quality than is currently possible.&lt;ref&gt;Schecter, Manny, [http://dotank.nyls.edu/communitypatent/BNA_10-20-06.html ''Open Collaboration Is Medicine for Our Ailing Patent System''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219161705/http://dotank.nyls.edu/communitypatent/BNA_10-20-06.html |date=2007-02-19 }}, BNA's Patent, Trademark &amp; Copyright Journal, Vol. 72, No. 1789, pp. 682-685, Oct. 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 17th and 18th centuries, patent examination in France for novelty and utility was performed by the private [[French Academy]] under commission from the French government.  The Academy sought the input of outside experts in the specific fields of the inventions.  [[Galileo]], for example, was consulted when a patent was applied for regarding a new method of determining longitude according to the position of the moon. Galileo’s conclusion is that the method would work in principle, but the measuring techniques are not accurate enough to provide meaningful results; therefore, the patent was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketsandpatents.com/bulletin/IPB-10152009.html |title=Nowotarski, Bakos, "A Short History of Private Patent Examination", Insurance IP Bulletin Oct. 2009 |publisher=Marketsandpatents.com |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal constraints==

===United States===
In the United States, the third parties may not provide commentary or opinions directly to a patent examiner during the prosecution of a patent unless the patent applicant gives the examiner written permission to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/1100_1134.htm#sect1134 |title=35 USC 122 plus MPEP commentary |publisher=Uspto.gov |date=2003-04-22 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rule 99, which previously allowed a member of the public to submit prior art to an examiner within two months of an application publication, has been repealed by the AIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/consolidated_rules.pdf |title=Consolidated Patent Rules |publisher=Uspto.gov |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate =2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rules 290 (37 CFR 1.290) and 35 USC 122(e) control the submission of prior-art references by third parties after the publication of an application and before the issuance of the patent. The cited prior-art references must be dated at least six months from the date of the publication, the first rejection of any claim, or the notice of allowance.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==History==

===Observations by third parties===
The [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC) provides that any person may present [[Observations by third parties under the European Patent Convention|observations concerning the patentability of an invention described in a European patent application]].&lt;ref name="ART115"&gt;{{EPC Article|115}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a form of public participation to patent examination. Filing such observations by third parties at the [[European Patent Organisation|European Patent Office]] (EPO) is free of charge, but the observations must include a statement of grounds.&lt;ref name="ART115"/&gt; The statement of grounds must be in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] or [[German language|German]].&lt;ref name="GUIDEV3"&gt;{{EPO Guidelines|e|v|3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The person filing the observations does not become party to the proceedings.&lt;ref name="ART115"/&gt;

In the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO), third parties may submit prior art relevant to a published patent application within two months of said publication or before a notice of allowance is given, whichever comes first.  In contrast to European practice, however, third parties are not allowed to provide any additional explanation of the relevance of the prior art. The USPTO requires a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/122 |title=37 USC § 122(e) Third-party submission in published application |publisher=law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries such as Australia can only accept but not grant patents after examination. The accepted patent is then advertised and public comment is sought. After the lapsing of a certain period (90 days in Australia) with no comment the patent is granted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/ActCompilation1.nsf/0/EAB4C263579FFE56CA2572AA0011CD8F/$file/Patents1990WD02.pdf  Australia Patents Act 1990].  Accessed October 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, a third party observation system was also introduced for [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] (PCT) applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=http://www.wipo.int/wilma/pct-general/201207/msg00000.html |title=PCT Newsletter Update |date=July 4, 2012  |accessdate=29 July 2012 |mailinglist=PCT Newsletter mailing list |last= |first= |authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The observations have to relate to novelty and inventive step, and they may be submitted anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/ai/s801.html |title=Administrative Instructions under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, Part 8: Instructions Relating to Observations by Third Parties, Section 801: Third Party Observation System |author= |date= |work=Administrative Instructions under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, as in force from July 1, 2012 |publisher=WIPO |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The observations can be made at any time from the publication of the PCT application until the expiration of 28 months from the priority date. No fee is due for filing the observations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2012/pct_news_2012_08.pdf Practical Advice, Making third party observations], [[PCT Newsletter]], July–August 2012, No. 07-08/2012, pp. 17-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wiki review ===
The review of [[patent]] and [[patent application]]s through [[wiki]] projects was proposed in 2005 by patent attorney J. Matthew Buchanan on his blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://promotetheprogress.com/blog/patent-reform-and-third-party-submission-of-art-a-proposed-solution/358/ |title=Patent Reform and Third Party Submission of Art: A proposed solution |publisher=Promotetheprogress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218141252/http://promotetheprogress.com/blog/patent-reform-and-third-party-submission-of-art-a-proposed-solution/358/ |archivedate=2012-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent proposal was made in ''Fortune'' magazine in 2006.&lt;ref name="FORTUNE"&gt;Nicholas Varchaver, [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/08/21/8383639/index.htm ''Patent review goes Wiki''], ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', VOL. 154, NO. 4 - August 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The claimed purpose is the improvement of the quality of the patent examination, as well as any re-examinations, through the involvement of the public, to help identify any relevant [[prior art]]. The USPTO has endorsed some of these projects.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

According to [[Dave Kappos]], former vice president for [[intellectual property|intellectual-property]] law at [[IBM]], and later head of the USPTO, "it's a very powerful concept because it leverages the enormous capabilities of the entire world of technical talent."&lt;ref name="FORTUNE"/&gt;

Wikipedia itself has been used by the U.S. [[patent examiner]]s as a reference to get a "quick outline of an unfamiliar topic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://just-n-examiner.livejournal.com/2007/01/17/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701004710/http://just-n-examiner.livejournal.com/2007/01/17/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-01 |title=Just-n-Examiner blog, January 17, 2007 |publisher=Just-n-examiner.livejournal.com |date=2007-01-17 |accessdate=2012-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Citations of Wikipedia as prior art, however, are not allowed in the U.S. due to the fluid and open nature of its editing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://just-n-examiner.livejournal.com/2006/10/01/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715204129/http://just-n-examiner.livejournal.com/2006/10/01/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-15 |title="Just a Patent Examiner" blog, October 1, 2006 |publisher=Just-n-examiner.livejournal.com |date=2006-10-01 |accessdate=2012-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in the related area of [[trademark]] examination, entries from Wikipedia have been cited in [[precedent|precedential opinions]] by the [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]] of the USPTO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/foia/ttab/2aissues/2006/78146926.pdf |title=In re Grand Forest Holdings Incorporated S/N 78220033, 20 October 2005 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206144631/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/foia/ttab/2aissues/2006/78146926.pdf |archivedate=6 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blackboard patent====
Wikipedia has also been used to collect early references related to controversial patents.  [[History of virtual learning environments]], for example, is an article that was created primarily to list prior art that would potentially invalidate {{US patent|6988138}}, “Internet-based education support system and methods”.  This patent issued to [[Blackboard Inc.]] in June 2000.  The [[Moodle]] wiki has a similar page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.moodle.org/en/Online_Learning_History#1999 |title=Online Learning History, Moodledocs wikipage |publisher=Docs.moodle.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204052431/http://docs.moodle.org/en/Online_Learning_History |archivedate=2007-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the patent was issued, Blackboard Inc. sued its competitor [[Desire2Learn]] to stop them from [[patent infringement|infringing the patent]].  In July 2009, the [[Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] held that all of the claims of the Blackboard patent were invalid either for being too vague or for being already  in practice before Blackboard filed their application.  Blackboard, however, has four [[continuation]] applications pending where it can correct the deficiencies in its claims and get new patents to issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2009/07/blackboard-v-desire2learn-fed-cir-2009-blackboards-patent-covers-an-internet-based-educational-support-system-and-metho.html |title=Patently O announcement of CAFC Blackboard decision |publisher=Patentlyo.com |date=2009-07-27 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the lawsuit was moving forward, the [[Software Freedom Law Center]] filed for a [[reexamination]] citing that new prior art had been discovered that raised a substantial new question of validity.  The USPTO agreed and the patent is currently undergoing reexamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softwarefreedom.org/news/20070125a.html |title="Patent Office Orders Re-Examination of Blackboard Patent", Software Freedom Law Center, January 25, 2007 |publisher=Softwarefreedom.org |date=2007-01-25 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==USPTO community patent review (Peer to Patent)==
On June 15, 2007, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] began a two-year pilot community patent review called [[Peer to patent]] or Community Patent Review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketsandpatents.com/bulletin/IPB-10152007.html |title=Schecter, Manny, Murray, Susan, "Peer to Patent:Community Patent Review", Insurance IP Bulletin, Oct. 15, 2007 |publisher=Marketsandpatents.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program organizers anticipate having 250 pending [[software patent]] applications reviewed by members of the interested public.  They can submit prior art along with commentary and vote on the most relevant prior art.  Four months after a patent application is posted the most relevant prior art is provided to the [[patent examiner]].

In the first five months of the program, over 20 applications have been opened to the public and 8 have completed reviews.  Over 28,000 site visits have been recorded.  1,600 reviewers from more than 100 different countries have registered.  Over one hundred thirty potential prior art references have been submitted. [[General Electric]], [[Hewlett Packard]], [[IBM]], [[Intel]], and [[Oracle Corporation]] each have volunteered some of their pending patent applications for review.

Patent examiners will have access to the commentary and will consider it in their examination.  Applications that are part of the pilot program will get accelerated examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schrock |first=Andrew |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/printer_friendly_article.aspx?id=19419 |title=Shrock, Andrew, "Opening up the Patent Process", MIT Technology Review, Sep 24, 2007 |publisher=Technologyreview.com |date=2007-09-24 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the first 19 office actions received by Peer-to-Patent applications, 5 cited the prior art submitted by reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cairns.typepad.com/peertopatent/2008/04/public-successf.html |title=Public Successfully Participates In U.S. Patent Examination Process, New York Law School Press Release |publisher=Cairns.typepad.com |date=2008-04-28 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new pilot started on October 25, 2010, and will continue until September 30, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/patents/init_events/peerpriorartpilotindex.jsp |title=Peer Review Pilot FY2011 |publisher=Uspto.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IP.Com PatentDebate==
IP.com PatentDebate is a [[blog]]-type Website were the public can comment on all pending published U.S. patent applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patentdebate.com/ |title=PatentDebate home page |publisher=Patentdebate.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  User registration is required. Unlike Peer to Patent, however, there is no formal relationship between the USPTO and PatentDebate.  The site is sponsored at least in part by advertising.

==Post issuance review==

===Article One Partners===
{{main|Article One Partners}}
Article One Partners provides a community review format for enlisting members of the public to search for prior art for already issued patents.  These patents are generally the subject of ongoing litigation.  Anyone who signs up can earn cash rewards if they submit the most relevant prior art.  Additionally, members can earn profit-sharing points for activities such as referring friends.

'''RedToL''', or Red Algal Tree of Life, is part of the collaborative [[National Science Foundation]] Assembling the Tree of Life activity (AToL), funded through the Division of [[Environmental Biology]], Directorate for [[Biological Sciences]]. The overall goal of AToL is to resolve [[evolutionary]] relationships for large groups of organisms throughout the history of life, with the research often involving large teams working across institutions and disciplines.  Investigators are typically supported for projects in data acquisition, analysis, algorithm development and dissemination in [[computational phylogenetics]] and phyloinformatics.

The Phylogenetic and Genomic Approaches to Reconstructing the Red Algal Tree of Life focus on the [[Rhodophyta]] ([[Rhodophyta|red algae]]), one of the most ancient [[eukaryotic]] [[phylum|phyla]] with [[fossil]] evidence for Bangiales stretching back 1.2 billion years. Red algae are not only key members of [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] and [[freshwater]] [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] environments but they are sources for important human foods such as [[dulse]] and [[sushi]] wrap, and have a multitude of pharmaceutical and industrial uses (e.g., [[agarose]] and [[carrageenans]]). Perhaps most important is the role red algae played in [[symbiogenesis]]. A red alga was the ancient (&gt;1 billion years ago) donor of the [[plastid]] in [[chlorophyll c1|chlorophyll c]]-containing algae ([[heterokonta]] or stramenophiles) that rose to prominence in marine ecosystems after the end of [[Permian]] with groups such as [[diatoms]] currently providing ca. 20% of global fixed [[carbon]].

==Aims==
The aims of RedToL are: 1) reconstruct a robust [[phylogeny]] of 471 red algal species using a [[concatenated]] dataset of 2 [[cell nucleus|nuclear]], 4 [[plastid]], and 2 [[mitochondrial]] encoded gene markers; 2) sequence plastid [[genome]]s and generate [[transcriptome]] databases for 16 key taxa that represent the phylogenetic (e.g., class- and order-level) breadth of the red algae, 3) make freely available red algal multi-gene and genome data via release to [[GenBank]] and a project-specific web site.  The outreach and student mentoring program is an important component of the RedToL initiative.

The 471 chosen [[species]] from 294 [[genera]] represent the diversity of ca. 6,000 red algal species (i.e., ca. 35% of all red algal genera will be included, which represent all extant orders). The robust phylogenetic framework resulting from this study is the basis for a comprehensive [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] revision of the red algae and provides the basis for interpreting key innovations during red algal [[evolution]]. Because the chosen marker genes are shared across different Assembling the Tree of Life (AToL) projects, it will provide a common framework for a future comprehensive [[eukaryotic]] tree. Complete plastid genome and transcriptome data from 16 major red algal taxa will provide a genome inventory to facilitate understanding of red algal evolution, as well as provide the basis for phylogenetic analyses using a rich set (i.e., 100s) of vertically inherited genes. The genome data will specifically test the relationships among the major classes and orders of red algae. The RedToL team members come from eight institutions including two foreign collaborators and fifteen advisory board members and represent the most prominent active national and international red algal specialists from different generations who use different methods (from [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] to [[phylogenomics]]) to enhance understanding of red algal biology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8536">{{Separation axioms}}

In [[topology]] and related fields of [[mathematics]], a [[topological space]] ''X'' is called a '''regular space''' if every [[closed subset]] ''C'' of ''X'' and a point ''p'' not contained in ''C'' admit non-overlapping [[open neighborhood]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Munkres | first=James R. | authorlink=James Munkres | title=Topology | edition=2nd | publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] | year=2000 | isbn=0-13-181629-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''p'' and ''C'' can be [[separated sets|separated]] by neighborhoods. This condition is known as '''Axiom T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''. The term "'''T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; space'''" usually means "a regular [[Hausdorff space]]". These conditions are examples of [[separation axiom]]s.

== Definitions ==
[[Image:Regular space.svg|250px|thumb|right|The point ''x'', represented by a dot to the left of the picture, and the closed set ''F'', represented by a closed disk to the right of the picture, are separated by their neighbourhoods ''U'' and ''V'', represented by larger [[open disk]]s. The dot ''x'' has plenty of room to wiggle around the open disk ''U'', and the closed disk F has plenty of room to wiggle around the open disk ''V'', yet ''U'' and ''V'' do not touch each other.]]

A [[topological space]] ''X'' is a '''regular space''' if, given any [[closed set]] ''F'' and any [[Point (geometry)|point]] ''x'' that does not belong to ''F'', there exists a [[neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhood]] ''U'' of ''x'' and a neighbourhood ''V'' of ''F'' that are [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]]. Concisely put, it must be possible to [[separated set|separate]] ''x'' and ''F'' with disjoint neighborhoods.

A '''T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; space''' or '''regular Hausdorff space''' is a topological space that is both regular and a [[Hausdorff space]]. (A Hausdorff space or T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; space is a topological space in which any two distinct points are separated by neighbourhoods.) It turns out that a space is T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if it is both regular and T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. (A T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or [[Kolmogorov space]] is a topological space in which any two distinct points are [[topologically distinguishable]], i.e., for every pair of distinct points, at least one of them has an [[open neighborhood]] not containing the other.) Indeed, if a space is Hausdorff then it is T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and each T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; regular space is Hausdorff: given two distinct points, at least one of them misses the closure of the other one, so (by regularity) there exist disjoint neighborhoods separating one point from (the closure of) the other.

Although the definitions presented here for "regular" and "T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;" are not uncommon, there is significant variation in the literature: some authors switch the definitions of "regular" and "T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;" as they are used here, or use both terms interchangeably. In this article, we will use the term "regular" freely, but we will usually say "regular Hausdorff", which is unambiguous, instead of the less precise "T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;". For more on this issue, see [[History of the separation axioms]].

A [[locally regular space]] is a topological space where every point has an open neighbourhood that is regular. Every regular space is locally regular, but the converse is not true. A classical example of a locally regular space that is not regular is the [[bug-eyed line]].

== Relationships to other separation axioms ==
A regular space is necessarily also [[preregular space|preregular]], i.e., any two [[topologically distinguishable]] points can be separated by neighbourhoods.
Since a Hausdorff space is the same as a preregular [[Kolmogorov space|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; space]], a regular space which is also T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; must be Hausdorff (and thus T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).
In fact, a regular Hausdorff space satisfies the slightly stronger condition [[Urysohn space|T&lt;sub&gt;2½&lt;/sub&gt;]].
(However, such a space need not be [[Completely Hausdorff space|completely Hausdorff]].)
Thus, the definition of T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; may cite T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, [[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], or T&lt;sub&gt;2½&lt;/sub&gt; instead of T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Hausdorffness); all are equivalent in the context of regular spaces.

Speaking more theoretically, the conditions of regularity and T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-ness are related by [[Kolmogorov quotient]]s.
A space is regular if and only if its Kolmogorov quotient is T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; and, as mentioned, a space is T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if it's both regular and T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.
Thus a regular space encountered in practice can usually be assumed to be T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, by replacing the space with its Kolmogorov quotient.

There are many results for topological spaces that hold for both regular and Hausdorff spaces.
Most of the time, these results hold for all preregular spaces; they were listed for regular and Hausdorff spaces separately because the idea of preregular spaces came later.
On the other hand, those results that are truly about regularity generally don't also apply to nonregular Hausdorff spaces.

There are many situations where another condition of topological spaces (such as [[normal space|normality]], [[Pseudonormal space|pseudonormality]], [[paracompactness]], or [[local compactness]]) will imply regularity if some weaker separation axiom, such as preregularity, is satisfied.
Such conditions often come in two versions: a regular version and a Hausdorff version.
Although Hausdorff spaces aren't generally regular, a Hausdorff space that is also (say) locally compact will be regular, because any Hausdorff space is preregular.
Thus from a certain point of view, regularity is not really the issue here, and we could impose a weaker condition instead to get the same result.
However, definitions are usually still phrased in terms of regularity, since this condition is more well known than any weaker one.

Most topological spaces studied in [[mathematical analysis]] are regular; in fact, they are usually [[completely regular space|completely regular]], which is a stronger condition.
Regular spaces should also be contrasted with [[normal space]]s.

== Examples and nonexamples ==
A [[zero-dimensional space]] with respect to the [[small inductive dimension]] has a [[Base (topology)|base]] consisting of [[clopen set]]s.
Every such space is regular.

As described above, any [[completely regular space]] is regular, and any T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; space that is not [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] (and hence not preregular) cannot be regular.
Most examples of regular and nonregular spaces studied in mathematics may be found in those two articles.
On the other hand, spaces that are regular but not completely regular, or preregular but not regular, are usually constructed only to provide [[counterexample]]s to conjectures, showing the boundaries of possible [[theorem]]s.
Of course, one can easily find regular spaces that are not T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and thus not Hausdorff, such as an [[indiscrete space]], but these examples provide more insight on the [[Kolmogorov axiom|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; axiom]] than on regularity.  An example of a regular space that is not completely regular is the [[Tychonoff corkscrew]].

Most interesting spaces in mathematics that are regular also satisfy some stronger condition.
Thus, regular spaces are usually studied to find properties and theorems, such as the ones below, that are actually applied to completely regular spaces, typically in analysis.

There exist Hausdorff spaces that are not regular.  An example is the set '''R''' with the topology generated by sets of the form ''U&amp;nbsp;— C'', where ''U'' is an open set in the usual sense, and ''C'' is any countable subset of ''U''.

== Elementary properties ==
Suppose that ''X'' is a regular space.
Then, given any point ''x'' and neighbourhood ''G'' of ''x'', there is a closed neighbourhood ''E'' of ''x'' that is a [[subset]] of ''G''.
In fancier terms, the closed neighbourhoods of ''x'' form a [[local base]] at ''x''.
In fact, this property characterises regular spaces; if the closed neighbourhoods of each point in a topological space form a local base at that point, then the space must be regular.

Taking the [[interior (topology)|interior]]s of these closed neighbourhoods, we see that the [[regular open set]]s form a [[base (topology)|base]] for the open sets of the regular space ''X''.
This property is actually weaker than regularity; a topological space whose regular open sets form a base is ''[[semiregular space|semiregular]]''.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or biomass, and biodiesel) and [[Hydrogen fuel]] (when produced with renewable processes).  This is in contrast to [[non-renewable resource|non-renewable]] fuels such as [[natural gas]], [[Liquified petroleum gas|LPG]] ([[propane]]), [[petroleum]] and other [[fossil fuels]] and [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]].  Renewable fuels can include fuels that are synthesized from [[renewable energy]] sources, such as wind and solar.  Renewable fuels have gained in popularity due to their [[sustainability]], [[Carbon neutral|low contributions]] to the [[carbon cycle]], and in some cases lower amounts of [[greenhouse gas]]es.  The geo-political ramifications of these fuels are also of interest, particularly to industrialized economies which desire [[Oil dependency|independence]] from [[Middle Eastern]] oil.

==Rationale for renewable fuels==
The [[International Energy Agency]]'s ''World Energy Outlook 2006'' concludes that rising oil demand, if left unchecked,
would accentuate the consuming countries' vulnerability to a severe supply disruption and resulting price shock. Renewable biofuels for transport represent a key source of diversification from [[petroleum products]]. Biofuels from grain and beet in [[temperate region]]s have a part to play, but they are relatively expensive and their energy efficiency and CO2 savings benefits, are variable. Biofuels from sugar cane and other highly productive tropical crops are much more competitive and beneficial. But all first generation biofuels ultimately compete with food production for land, water, and other resources. Greater efforts are required to develop and commercialize second generation biofuel technologies, such as biorefineries and [[cellulosic ethanol|ligno-cellulosics]], enabling the flexible production of biofuels and other products from non-edible plant materials.&lt;ref name=IEA&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2007/so_contribution.pdf Contribution of Renewables to Energy Security]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbert's [[Hubbert peak theory|peak oil theory]] suggests that petroleum is a [[finite resource]] that is rapidly depleting. Of the worldwide total remaining petroleum reserves of approximately {{convert|1277702000000|oilbbl|km3}} (about one half of the original virgin reserves) and a worldwide usage rate of {{convert|25000000000|oilbbl|km3}} per year, only about 50 years worth of [[petroleum]] is predicted to remain at the current depletion rate. Petroleum is imperative for the following industries: [[fuel]] (home heating, jet fuel, gasoline, diesel, etc.) [[transportation]], [[agriculture]], [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]], [[plastics]]/resins, man-made fibers, [[synthetic rubber]], and [[explosives]]. If the modern world remains reliant on petroleum as a source of energy, the price of crude oil could increase markedly, destabilizing economies worldwide. Consequently, renewable fuel drivers include: high oil prices, imbalance of trade, instability in oil exporting regions of the world, the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], the potential for windfall profits for American farmers and industries, avoidance of economic depression, avoidance of scarcity of products due to a volatile ‘[[peak oil]]’ scenario expected to begin as early as 2021,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July05/ethanol.toocostly.ssl.html Biomass for biofuel isn't worth it&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (though peak oil is not a new idea) and a slowing of [[global warming]] that may usher in unprecedented [[climate change]].

Furthermore, the global debate on [[climate change]], along with regional geopolitical instabilities have challenged nations to act to develop both alternative and [[carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral]] sources of energy. Renewable fuels are therefore becoming attractive to many governments, who are beginning to see sustainable energy independence as a valuable asset.

On December 19, 2007, President Bush signed into law the [[Energy Independence and Security Act]], establishing a requirement that at least {{convert|36|e9USgal|m3}} of renewable fuel be used in the marketplace by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/Government/MotorFuels/Pages/RenewableFuels.aspx Issue Update: Renewable Fuels Retailer Liability]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), [[cellulosic ethanol commercialization]] could allow [[ethanol fuel]]s to play a much larger role in the future than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;International Energy Agency (2006). [http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/summaries2006/English.pdf ''World Energy Outlook 2006''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041451/http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/summaries2006/English.pdf |date=2007-09-28 }} p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants.

Biofuel is a type of fuel whose energy is derived from biological [[carbon fixation]]. Biofuels include fuels derived from [[biomass]] conversion, as well as  [[Biofuel#Solid biofuels|solid biomass]], [[liquid fuels]] and various [[biogas]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.apenergy.2009.04.036| title = Political, economic and environmental impacts of biofuels: A review| year = 2009| last1 = Demirbas | first1 = A. .| journal = Applied Energy| volume = 86| pages = S108–S117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although [[fossil fuel]]s have their origin in ancient [[carbon fixation]], they are not considered biofuels by the generally accepted definition because they contain carbon that has been "out" of the carbon cycle for a very long time. Biofuels are gaining increased public and scientific attention, driven by factors such as [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil price spikes]], the need for increased [[energy security]], concern over [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from [[fossil fuel]]s, and support from [[Ethanol fuel in the United_States#Tax_credits|government subsidies]].

[[Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]], mostly from [[carbohydrate]]s produced in [[sugar]] or [[starch]] crops such as [[Maize|corn]] or [[sugar cane]].  [[cellulose|Cellulosic biomass]], derived from non-food sources such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a [[feedstock]] for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] [[Fuel additive|additive]] to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[biofuel in the united states|USA]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]]. Current plant design does not provide for converting the [[lignin]] portion of plant raw materials to fuel components by fermentation.

[[Biodiesel]] is made from [[vegetable oil]]s and [[animal fat]]s. Biodiesel can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[diesel fuel|diesel]] additive to reduce levels of particulates, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[hydrocarbon]]s from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe.

In 2010 worldwide biofuel production reached 105 billion liters (28 billion gallons US), up 17% from 2009, and biofuels provided 2.7% of the world's fuels for road transport, a contribution largely made up of ethanol and biodiesel.&lt;ref name=Biofuels2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/biofuels-make-comeback-despite-tough-economy|title=Biofuels Make a Comeback Despite Tough Economy|publisher=[[Worldwatch Institute]]|date=2011-08-31|accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global [[ethanol fuel]] production reached 86 billion liters (23 billion gallons US) in 2010, with the United States and Brazil as the world's top producers, accounting together for 90% of global production. The world's largest biodiesel producer is the [[European Union]], accounting for 53% of all biodiesel production in 2010.&lt;ref name=Biofuels2010/&gt; As of 2011, mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries at the national level and in 29 states/provinces.&lt;ref name=ren212011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |year=2011 |pages=13–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[International Energy Agency]], biofuels have the potential to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/Oil/6017103 |title=IEA says biofuels can displace 27% of transportation fuels by 2050 Washington |author= |date=20 April 2011 |work=Platts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pyrolysis oil]] is another type of fuel derived from the [[Lignocellulosic biomass|lignocellulosic]] fraction of biomass. By rapidly heating biomass in the absence of oxygen ([[pyrolysis]]), a liquid crude can be formed that can be further processed into a usable bio-oil. As opposed to other biofuels, pyrolysis oils use the non-edible fraction of biomass and can occur on the order of milliseconds and without the need for large fermentation reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huber|first=George|title=Breaking the Chemical and Engineering Barriers to Lignocellulosic Biofuels: Next Generation Hydrocarbon Biorefineries|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrogen fuel==
[[Image:Photo praxair plant.hydrogen.infrastructure.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Hydrogen fuel requires the development of a specific infrastructure for processing, transport and storage.]]
{{main|Hydrogen economy}}
[[Hydrogen fuel]] refers to the use of [[hydrogen]] gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as an energy carrier. Broadly speaking, the production of renewable [[hydrogen fuel]] can be divided into two general categories: biologically derived production, and chemical production.&lt;ref name="nrelH2production"&gt;National Renewable Energy Laboratory 2003 ''Research Review'': "[http://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/pdfs/49923.pdf New Horizons for Hydrogen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192032/http://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/pdfs/49923.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}."&lt;/ref&gt; This is an area of current research, and new developments and technologies are causing this field to evolve rapidly.

The biological production of hydrogen fuel has been a topic of research since at least the 1970s. Hydrogen gas can be produced from biomass sources like agricultural and forest residues, consumer waste and other specific agricultural crops.&lt;ref name="nrelH2production" /&gt; Specifically, hydrogen fuel is produced by a process called [[gasification]], where biomass is processed into a combustible gas and then burned, or by [[pyrolysis]], a related process which can lead to hydrogen gas suitable for fuel-cell applications. One continuing subject of research regards the production of unwanted co-products in both of these processes. The presence of other contaminant gases often depend on specific composition of the biomass source, which can be difficult to control.&lt;ref name="nrelH2production" /&gt; Another source for biological production of hydrogen fuel is [[algae]]. In the late 1990s it was discovered that if algae are deprived of sulfur they will switch from the production of oxygen, as in normal photosynthesis, to the production of hydrogen.&lt;ref name="wiredSwamp"&gt;Wired, ''[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.04/mustread.html?pg=5 It Came from the Swamp: Reengineering Algae To Fuel The Hydrogen Economy],'' accessed September 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental [[Biological hydrogen production (Algae)|algae farms]] are attempting to make algae an economically feasible energy source.&lt;ref name="registerAlgae"&gt;The Register, ''[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/02/24/pond_scum_breakthrough/ Pond life: the future of energy],'' accessed September 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also several physico-chemical methods for producing hydrogen; most of these methods require electrolysis of water. When this process draws its power from renewable energy sources like [[wind turbines]] or [[photovoltaic cells]], the production requires little consumption of non-renewable resources. Hydrogen fuel, when produced by renewable sources of energy like wind or solar power, is a renewable fuel.&lt;ref name="nrelH2production" /&gt;

==Processed engineered fuel==
PEF is a partial replacement for fossil fuels in cement kilns. It has significant calorific value and can be used as a fuel substitute for coal and gas in high-combustion facilities. PEF facilities typically divert waste from landfill, reducing demand for non-renewable coal and reducing waste to landfill.

'''Social facilitation''', or the '''audience effect''', is the tendency for people to perform differently when in the presence of others than when alone. Compared to their performance when alone, when in the presence of others, they tend to perform better on simple or well-rehearsed tasks and worse on complex or new ones.&lt;ref name="Strauss"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Strauss|first= Bernd|date= July 2002|title= Social facilitation in motor tasks: a review of research and theory|url= |journal= Psychology of Sport and Exercise|publisher= |volume= 3|issue= 3|pages= 237–256|doi= 10.1016/S1469-0292(01)00019-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yerkes-Dodson law, when applied to social facilitation, states that "the mere presence of other people will enhance the performance in speed and accuracy of well-practiced tasks, but will degrade in the performance of less familiar tasks."&lt;ref name="Kirby"&gt;Kirby, L. (2011, March 17). Group Processes. Lecture presented to Social Psychology Course at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social facilitation has occasionally been attributed to the fact that certain people are more susceptible to [[social influence]], with the argument that personality factors can make these people more aware of evaluation.

The audience effect is an attempt at psychologically explaining why the presence of an audience leads to people's performing tasks better in some cases and worse in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Aiello|first= John R.|last2= Douthitt|first2= Elizabeth A.|date= 2001|title= Social Facilitation From Triplett to Economic Performance Monitoring|url= http://www.radford.edu/~jaspelme/_private/gradsoc_articles/social%20loafing/Soc%20Facilitation-Triplett2.pdf|journal= [[Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice]]|publisher= |volume= 5|issue= 3|pages= 163–180|doi= 10.1037/1089-2699.5.3.163|accessdate= 13 November 2014|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140513142123/http://www.radford.edu/~jaspelme/_private/gradsoc_articles/social%20loafing/Soc%20Facilitation-Triplett2.pdf|archivedate= 13 May 2014|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was further explored when some studies showed that the presence of a passive audience facilitated the better performance of a simple task, while other studies showed that the presence of a passive audience inhibited the performance of a more difficult task or one that was not well practiced, possibly due to psychological pressure or [[Stress (psychological)|stress]]. (See [[Yerkes–Dodson law]].)

== History ==
Social facilitation can be defined as a tendency for individuals to perform differently when in the mere presence of others. Specifically, individuals perform better on simpler or well-rehearsed tasks and perform worse on complex or new ones. In relation to this, there are three main empirical relationships which are the activation, evaluation, and attention theories. The activation theory describes how we are physiologically aroused and how that affects our functioning. The evaluation theory relates to the systematic assessment of the worth or merit of some object. The attention theory takes into account possession in the mind including focalization and concentration of consciousness.

In 1897, Triplett&lt;ref name=smith&gt;[https://www.science.smith.edu/departments/EXER_SCI/ESS570/Soc.%20Fac/SocFacil.html]&lt;/ref&gt; studied the effect on performance of having an audience. Triplett's experiment had a simple design; a cyclist's performance when alone was compared with a cyclist's performance when racing against another cyclist. He found that the cyclist was slowest when he was only racing the clock and not another cyclist. He attributed these results to a competitive instinct which releases energy that was not available when pedaling alone. Triplett's study started off a revolution of studies attempting to examine the theory that people's performance is influenced by the presence of others. In 1898, while studying the competitive nature of children,&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt; he found that children were much faster at completing their given activity (winding string) while they were competing, which caused him to wonder whether or not simply having another individual there would have the same effect. To determine this, Triplett studied the race time of cyclists and found that cyclists had faster race times when in the presence of other cyclists. He theorized that the faster times were because the presence of others made individuals more competitive, and further research led Triplett to theorize that the presence of others increases individuals' performances in other noncompetitive situations as well.

In 1924, Floyd Allport, coined the term social facilitation.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt; Allport conducted studies in which participants sat either alone or with other participants and did a variety of tasks such as word association tasks and multiplication assessments. He found that people performed better when in a group setting than when alone for the majority of tasks.&lt;ref name="Zajonc1965"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Zajonc|first= Robert B.|date= July 16, 1965|title= Social Facilitation|journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]]|publisher= [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]|volume= 149|issue= 3681|pages= 269–274|doi= 10.1126/science.149.3681.269|jstor=1715944}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at this time, social facilitation simply meant an "increase in response merely from the sight or sound of others making the same movement."&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

Hazel Markus of the [[University of Michigan]] conducted an experiment to test the hypothesis that the mere presence of others can influence an individual's performance.&lt;ref name="Markus1978"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Markus|first= Hazel|date= 1978|title=  The Effect of Mere Presence on Social Facilitation: An Unobtrusive Test|url= http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/22584/0000132.pdf|journal= [[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]]|publisher= |volume= 14|issue= 4|pages= 389–397|doi= 10.1016/0022-1031(78)90034-3|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A task that lacked a rubric structure and was likely to cause the subject to be apprehensive of how they would be evaluated was used. Performance times on the task of dressing and undressing in familiar and unfamiliar clothing were compared with subjects working alone, working in the presence of a passive inattentive person, and working in the presence of an attentive spectator. Compared to the alone condition, both social conditions (audience and incidental audience) enhanced performance on the well-learned aspects of the task of dressing and undressing with the subject's own familiar clothing and hindered the subject's performance on the more complex aspects of the task of dressing and undressing using unfamiliar clothing. It was concluded that the presence of others is a sufficient condition for social facilitation and social interference effects. Therefore, the presence of an audience causes an individual to do better on a simple task or worse on a more complicated task.

In a 2010 study, [[donation]] rates increased with the presence of observers, and [[neuroimaging]] revealed that the presence of observers significantly affected activation in the [[ventral striatum]] before the choice of whether or not to donate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Izuma|first= Keise|last2= Saito|first2= Daisuke N.|last3= Sadato|first3= Norihiro|date= April 2010|title= Processing of the Incentive for Social Approval in the Ventral Striatum during Charitable Donation|url= |journal= [[Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience]]|publisher= [[MIT Press]]|volume= 22|issue= 4|pages= 621–631|doi= 10.1162/jocn.2009.21228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Raefeli's meta-analysis of the social facilitation phenomenon in 2002, three conclusions are made. Firstly, the presence of others heightens an individual's physiological arousal only if the individual is performing a complex task. Moreover, the mere presence of others increases the speed of simple task performance and decrease the speed of complex task performance. Lastly, social facilitation effects are surprisingly unrelated to the performer's evaluation apprehension.&lt;ref name="Rafaeli, S 2002"&gt;Rafaeli, S; Rafaeli, S.; Noy, A.; Correspondence (September 2002). European Journal of Information Systems, Volume 11, Number 3: 196-207.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study was done in 2014 that compared the performance of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to typically developing (TD) individuals on a task with the presence of another. The experiment conducted tested the hypothesis that an individual with ASD, will respond to the presence of experimenters, thus altering the results of the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=7524ca24-1834-4ab5-99a2-13a16870db45%40sessionmgr4001&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=4201|title = Susceptibility to the audience effect explains performance gap between children with and without autism in a theory of mind task|last = Chevallier|first = C|date = 2014|journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology|doi = 10.1037/a0035483|pmid = |access-date = September 28, 2015|last2 = Parish-Morris|first2 = J|last3 = Tonge|first3 = N|last4 = Le|first4 = L|last5 = Miller|first5 = J|last6 = Schultz|first6 = R.T.|volume=143|pages=972–979|pmc = 4038654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major theoretical approaches ==
The major three approaches to social facilitation are the activation, evaluation, and attention theories. The activation theory describes how our arousal relates to social facilitation. The evaluation theory discusses how being assessed by an audience affects to social facilitation. The attention theory takes into account the effect of distractions in the environment on social facilitation.

=== Activation theory ===

In 1956, [[Robert Zajonc]]&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; was trying to figure out why some studies showed people's performance being hindered by the  presence of others rather than being made more accurate. He designed an experiment that would examine the performance of someone doing a simple vs. complex task in front of others. He found that, when people were performing a simple task in the presence of others, they could complete it with greater accuracy than when they were alone. This was something most psychologist were aware of at this time. However, what Zajonc found that was revolutionary in this time period was that, when people attempt to perform tasks which are more complex or with which they are not familiar, they complete it with less accuracy when in the presence of others than when they alone. Thus, [[social inhibition]] was born.

In 1965, Robert Zajonc developed the stern activation theory, by proposing his generalized drive hypothesis for social facilitation. Zajonc's generalized drive hypothesis was the first theory that addressed why the presence of others increased performance sometimes yet decreased it at other times. He argued that the presence of others serves as a source of arousal, and heightened arousal increases the likelihood of an organism to do better on well-learned or habitual responses. For this reason, arousal improves performance on simple, or well-learned tasks, but impairs performance on complex, or not well-learned tasks. Zajonc's reasoning was based on Yerkes-Dodson's law, which holds that performance works like an inverse "U" function. This means that an individual's optimal drive is higher for simpler, or well-practiced tasks, and that the same individual's optimal drive is lower for more complex, or less-practiced tasks. The presence of other people further arouses us and increases our drive level, and so an individual's performance will be enhanced if a task is simple (because of the high levels of energy) but diminished if the task is complex.&lt;ref name="Kirby" /&gt; He tested his theories by having people complete word association tasks alone and again in the presence of others, and found that the tasks were done much faster while in the presence of others.

Other activation theories include the alertness hypothesis, the monitoring hypothesis, and the challenge and threat hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

==== Alertness hypothesis ====
The alertness hypothesis says that people are uncertain of how observers will act while in the presence of others, so they become more alert (because the performer will be uncertain about how the observers will act in the situation). It is this heightened alertness which causes them to perform better on tasks.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

==== Monitoring hypothesis ====
The monitoring hypothesis posits that social facilitation effects do not occur when the performer is familiar with the observers or the situation. This is because, in those cases, the performer knows how the observer will respond or how the situation will take place. Therefore, in such situations the performer's arousal will not increase. So, if the person is unfamiliar with the observers or the situation, he/she will experience uncertainty and arousal will increase, but not if he/she is familiar with them.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

==== Challenge and threat hypotheses ====
The challenge and threat hypothesis states that people perform worse on complex tasks and better on simple tasks when in the presence of others because of the type of cardio-vascular response to the task. When performing a simple task in the presence of others, people show a normal cardiovascular response. However, when performing a complex task in the presence of others, the cardiovascular response is similar to that of a person in a threatening position. The normal cardiovascular response serves to improve performance, but the threat-like cardiovascular response serves to impede performance.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

=== Evaluation approach ===

In 1968, Henchy and Glass proposed the evaluation approach to social facilitation.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt; Their [[Evaluation apprehension model|evaluation apprehension hypothesis]] states that it is not the mere presence of others that increases individual activation/arousal, but rather the fear of being evaluated by an audience. They studied the reactivity of male high school and college students, where their responses were based on the strength they developed through prior training, and found that the groups who felt their performance was being evaluated had more dominant responses than the groups who were simply in the presence of an audience without being evaluated, or  those that were alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Evaluation apprehension and the social facilitation of dominant and subordinate responses.|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1969-06839-001|website = APA PsycNET|accessdate = 2015-11-30|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Learned drive hypothesis ====
A further extension of the evaluation approach is the learned drive hypothesis, which was developed by Cottrell, Wack, Sekerak, and Rittle, and states that activation only increases when actors feel that the audience is capable of evaluating their performance. In other words, it implies that the cause of evaluation apprehension comes from a learned audience. They studied how a participant performed on well-learned tasks while in the presence of an audience focused on another event, and in the presence of an audience focused on the tasks being performed. They found that participants performing in the latter group, with the audience that was focused on what the participants were doing, largely gave dominant responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wendyberrymendes.com/cms/uploads/Blascovich1999-%20Social%20facilit(2).pdf|title = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Blascovich, Mendes, Hunter|first = Jim, Wendy, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weiss and Miller furthered developed the evaluation approach by hypothesizing that activation only increases when the actors fear a negative evaluation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Basic Group Processes|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PJHbBwAAQBAJ|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date = 2012-12-06|isbn = 9781461255789|first = Paul|last = Paulus}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory suggests that activation increases when the audience or other competitors cause negative feelings, such as anxiety, in the actor. However, Good's development of evaluation apprehension takes the opposite approach, where he hypothesizes that activation increases when actors expect a positive evaluation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Because of the conflicting theories under the evaluation approach, there has been controversy over its reliability. A meta-analysis done by Bond found that even when individuals are in the presence of a non-visible or non-evaluative audience, activation still occurs for an increase in dominant responses.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bond | first1 = C. F. | last2 = Titus | first2 = L. J. | year = 1983 | title = Social facilitation: a meta-analysis of 241 studies | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 94 | issue = 2| page = 265 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.94.2.265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attention approach ===

In the 1980s, explanations shifted from activation theories to attention theories, which imply that withdrawal from some things is necessary in order to deal effectively with others. Attention theories that explain social facilitation include the [[distraction-conflict]] hypothesis, the overload hypothesis, the feedback-loop model, and the capacity model.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

==== Distraction-conflict hypothesis ====
In his distraction-conflict hypothesis, Robert Baron proposed that the level of performance on a task is predicted by the amount of [[distraction]]s in the environment surrounding the task. The hypothesis states that distraction leads to arousal, so the presence of others always impedes performance on difficult tasks, but the number of distractions in the environment either improves or impedes the performance on simple tasks.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

==== Overload hypothesis ====
The overload hypothesis works according to the distraction-conflict hypothesis, saying that distracters do not lead to increased arousal, but rather to [[cognitive load|cognitive overload]] (when an individual is bombarded with excessive information in their working memory),&lt;ref&gt;"Cognitive overload · Foviance." Foviance · customer experience, usability, web analytics, accessibility &amp; user research consultancy based in London, UK. N.p., n.d. Web. 24 Apr. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and while in cognitive overload, individuals will do worse on complex tasks and better on more simple tasks.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt; Performance increases on simple tasks because the performers focus their attention on the new stimuli, instead of the irrelevant stimuli that is characteristic of simple tasks. Performance decreases on complex tasks because the performers focus on the distracters, but also need to focus on the relevant stimuli that are characteristic of complex tasks, and they cannot handle all of the information they are being presented with.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

==== Feedback-loop model ====
The feedback-loop model postulates that when people feel they are being observed, they focus attention on themselves. While in this state, individuals become aware of the differences between their actual behavior and anticipated behavior. So, by feedback-loop model, people do better in the presence of others because of this increased awareness about their behavior.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

==== Capacity model ====
The capacity model of social facilitation focuses on the role of types of information processing on performance in front of an audience, rather than the performance on different type of tasks (simple or complex) in front of an audience. The capacity model suggests that for tasks that require automatic information processing, the presence of others does not cause problems because the short-term memory is not required for automatic information processing, so performance quality increases. However, for tasks that require controlled information processing, the presence of others does impede the level of performance because the short-term memory is necessary to both focus attention on the audience, as well as the task at hand.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

=== Self-presentation approach ===

The self-presentation approach to social facilitation has two main theories: one regarding arousal or drive, and one without. The first theory argues that in the presence of an audience, individuals become concerned with self-presentation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Social Facilitation|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qdq_G-VYev4C&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=self+presentation+approach+social+facilitation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=owwDWsDrnT&amp;sig=3xFatdwt_URTnBD_-TiMV2SYm6Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYn52k9bbJAhXBej4KHSftBpUQ6AEILzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=self%2520presentation%2520approach%2520social%2520facilitation&amp;f=false|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2009-09-17|isbn = 9780521119795|first = Bernard|last = Guerin|first2 = John|last2 = Innes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possible embarrassment that occurs with negative evaluation leads to activation of arousal, or increased drive which will cause more dominant effects. The second theory argues that it is not an issue of arousal, but rather of simple responses, because the individual wants to appear competent in the presence of others. If the task is easy, the individual will want to make him/herself appear even more competent by doing exceptionally well on the task. However, if the task is difficult, they will fear that they will present themselves as incompetent, which will in turn make them embarrassed, and further impede their performance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

However, there has not been significant research done or evidence supporting the self-presentation approach. The main study looking at this approach was done by Bond in 1982, but it did not include independent measures of self-presentation, so it was not able to conclusively prove the validity of this approach.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Major empirical findings ==

=== Age ===
In 1898, Norman Triplett pioneered research on social facilitation by studying the competitive nature of children. In this study, each child was given a string and was told to wind it. He found that children performed much better while they were competing with one another, and further research led Triplett to theorize that the presence of others increases individuals' performances in other noncompetitive situations as well.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

In 1973, Chapman ran an experiment and found that levels of laughter among 7–8 year-old children were highest when two children listened to funny material together (coaction condition). Furthermore, levels of laughter were higher when one child listened to funny material in the presence of another child (audience condition) than when one child listened to the funny material alone (alone condition). These results indicate that laughter is also socially facilitated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chapman | first1 = Antony J. | year = 1973 | title = Social Facilitation of Laughter in Children | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = 6| pages = 528–541 | doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(73)90035-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender ===
In 1994, De Castro demonstrated that social facilitation affects food intake by extending the time spent eating a meal. His results also showed that the presence of family and friends, in comparison with the presence of mere companions, increases food intake to a greater degree, possibly due to the "release of inhibitory restraints on intake" that occurs when people feel more comfortable around people they are familiar with. Furthermore, males ate 36% more food when with other people than when alone, and females ate 40% more food when with other people than when alone. De Castro attributes this to the time-extension model of social facilitation, as the time spent at a meal increased when the meal was a social occasion. These results suggest that the presence of other people at a meal increases intake by extending the time spent at the meal, probably as a result of social interaction, and that family and friends have an even larger effect, probably by producing relaxation and a consequent disinhibition of restraint on intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Castro | first1 = John M. | year = 1994 | title = Family and friends produce greater social facilitation of food intake than other companions | url = | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 445–455 | doi = 10.1016/0031-9384(94)90286-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, these results also suggest that social facilitation has very similar effects on both men and women.

=== Performance ===
In 1920, when asked to write out as many words as possible in response to a given word, 93% of participants produced more words in the presence of another person than alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.uic.edu/labs/skitka/public_html/Teams.pdf|title = Automation Bias and Errors: Are Crews Better Than Individuals?|date = 2000|accessdate = |website = |publisher = THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AVIATION PSYCHOLOGY|last = Skitka, Mosier, Burdick, Rosenblatt|first = Linda J., Kathleen L., Mark, Bonnie}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when this study was replicated with individuals who stuttered when they spoke, 80% of the participants produced more words when alone rather than in the presence of another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Travis | first1 = L.E. | year = 1928 | title = The influence of the group upon the stutter's speed in free association | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 45–51 | doi = 10.1037/h0074512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee Edward Travis conducted a study to find what kind of effect an audience has on an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Travis|first= Lee Edward|date= July 1925|title= The effect of a small audience upon eye-hand coordination|url= http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/abn/20/2/142.pdf|journal= [[Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology]]|publisher= |volume= 20|issue= 2|pages= 142–146|doi= 10.1037/h0071311|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travis used an [[eye–hand coordination]] test (holding a flexible pointer on a revolving target) for his study. Twenty freshmen males, one sophomore male, and one junior male were used as the subjects. The small audience consisted of four to eight upper classmen and graduate students and was an equal number of men and women. Each observer practiced in the presence of the experimenter, and their learning curve was plotted each day. When the subject attained his maximum efficiency, the passive audience was brought in. Some of the subjects showed superior coordination when the audience was present.

In June 1980, Forgas et al. conducted a field study of audience effects, looking at the performance of expert and novice squash players when observed by no audience, a male audience, and a female audience. Contrary to Zajonc's drive-arousal theory, it was found that the effect of an audience on performance did not differ significantly between novice and expert players. This indicates that the other factors, such as cognitive variables and players' interpretation of the audience's presence, also influence players' reactions to the presence of an audience in a natural setting.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Forgas, Joseph P.|author2=Brennan, Greg|author3=Howe, Susan|author4=Fane, John F.|author5=Sweet, Shirley|date=June 1980|title=Audience Effects on Squash Players' Performance|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=111|issue=1|pp=41–47|doi=10.1080/00224545.1980.9924271|ISSN=0022-4545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, people playing pool were being surreptitiously watched in order to identify skilled and unskilled players. Skilled players made at least two-thirds of their shots whereas unskilled players missed at least two-thirds of their shots. When the observer moved closer to the pool table and continued to watch, skilled players' performance improved by 14% and the unskilled players' performance dropped by more than 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Michaels, J.W.|author2=Blommel, J.M.|author3=Brocato, R.M.|author4=Linkous, R.A.|author5=Rowe, J.S.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1982|title=Social facilitation and inhibition in a natural setting|journal=Replications in social psychology|volume=2|pp=21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Rosenbloom et al. studied archival data from Jerusalem in 2004 and found that the presence of an additional person in the car during a driving license test decreased the likelihood that the testee would pass the driving test. Although the nature of the study made it impossible to distinguish one explanation of social facilitation from another, the findings generally support the basic premise of social facilitation theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rosenbloom, Tova|author2=Shahar, Amit|author3=Perlman, Amotz|author4=Estreich, Dov|author5=Kirzner, Eyal|date=November 2007|title=Success on a practical driver's license test with and without the presence of another testee|journal=Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention|volume=39|issue=6|pp=1296–1301|doi=10.1016/j.aap.2007.03.015|pmid=17920854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, college students were given a list of words and told to copy them as quickly as they could. The "easy task" was to write out one list with their dominant hand and the "hard task" was to write out another list with their nondominant hand. While completing the task, they were in the presence of an image of their favorite television personality (displayed on a computer screen) or an image of another character from the same show. When given the easy task, they wrote more words in the presence of their favorite character and when given the hard task, the favorite character inhibited their performance. As shown, while the college students were given tasks, their favorite television characters are perceived as "real" in a social facilitation paradigm which gives evidence as to how social facilitation can affect performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gardner | first1 = Wendi L. | last2 = Knowles | first2 = M.L. | last3 = Megan | first3 = L. | year = 2008 | title = Love makes you real: Favorite television characters are perceived as 'real' in a social facilitation paradigm | url = | journal = Social Cognition | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 156–168 | doi = 10.1521/soco.2008.26.2.156 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Hill, Hanton, Matthews, and Fleming studied sub-optimal performance in spots, also known as the phenomenon of "choking". They determined that when individuals were worried about negative evaluations by the audience, and performing tasks that they were not familiar with, they often would perform at a lower level than when they did without an audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Choking in sport: a review|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17509840903301199|journal = International Review of Sport and Exercise Psychology|date = 2010-03-01|issn = 1750-984X|pages = 24–39|volume = 3|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/17509840903301199|first = Denise M.|last = Hill|first2 = Sheldon|last2 = Hanton|first3 = Nic|last3 = Matthews|first4 = Scott|last4 = Fleming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Anderson-Hanley, Snyder, Nimon, and Arciero found that older adults riding "cybercycles", virtual-reality enhanced stationary bikes with interactive competitions, exercised at higher rates than adults riding stationary bikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social facilitation in virtual reality-enhanced exercise: competitiveness moderates exercise effort of older adults|journal = Clinical Interventions in Aging|date = 2011-01-01|issn = 1176-9092|pmc = 3212419|pmid = 22087067|pages = 275–280|volume = 6|doi = 10.2147/CIA.S25337|first = Cay|last = Anderson-Hanley|first2 = Amanda L|last2 = Snyder|first3 = Joseph P|last3 = Nimon|first4 = Paul J|last4 = Arciero}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Muryama and Elliot conducted a meta-analysis where they found that the effects on performance commonly attributed to competition are actually due to performance goals. Competition prompts either performance-approach goals, which are what facilitate performance improvements, or performance-avoidance goals, which undermine performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The competition–performance relation: A meta-analytic review and test of the opposing processes model of competition and performance.|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/138/6/1035/|website = APA PsycNET|accessdate = 2015-11-30|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animals ===
Social facilitation in animals is when the performance of a behaviour by an animal increases the probability of other animals also engaging in that behaviour or increasing the intensity of the behaviour. In 1969, Zajonc, Heingartner, and Herman demonstrated that social facilitation occurs not only in humans, but also in species with limited or no cognitive processing. They observed that it takes a cockroach a longer time to complete a complex maze in the presence of other cockroaches than when alone. They also observed that in a simple, straight runway, a cockroach reaches the end of the runway faster in the presence of other cockroaches than when alone. This experiment lends support to the theory that physiological arousal resulting from the presence of others leads to similar social facilitation effects in animals as well.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zajonc | first1 = Robert B. | last2 = Heingartner | first2 = Alexander | last3 = Herman | first3 = Edward M. | year = 1969 | title = Social Enhancement and Impairment of Performance in the Cockroach | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 83–92 | doi = 10.1037/h0028063 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Dindo, Whiten, and de Waal studied the effect of social facilitation in capuchin monkeys. The monkeys in this study were required to complete a new foraging task, either alone or in a social group. While both sets of monkeys completed the task, those in the social group completed it three times faster than those monkeys that were alone. This increase in speed was attributed to "observational learning and synchronization of behavior between group mates."&lt;ref&gt;Dindo, Marietta; Whiten, Andrew; de Waal, Frans B. M. (23 February 2009). "Social facilitation of exploratory foraging behavior in capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella)" ''American Journal of Primatology'' 71 (5): 419–426. {{DOI|10.1002/ajp.20669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electronic performance monitoring==

Researchers have used electronic performance monitoring (EPM) to examine the effects of social facilitation. This trend had previously been limited to face-to-face or group settings, but electronic performance monitoring establishes the impact of social facilitation in a virtual sense. EPM is the utilization of information technologies (e.g. computer networks) to track, evaluate, analyze, and report information regarding an employee's performance. Many businesses have adopted this method in which workers activity is automatically monitored throughout the workday. This topic is of substantial interest to those in the field of social psychology due to underlying mechanism at work; namely, the phenomenon of social facilitation.

One study found that EPM did enhance productivity, but only in ways that are consistent with the effects of social facilitation. Employees working on a data entry task were monitored while working alone, with others, or as part of a cohesive group. Results indicated that EPM improved the performance of highly skilled workers, but interfered with the performance of those who were less skilled. Moreover, with the exception of those working in a cohesive group, monitoring was found to increase workers' feelings of stress and anxiety. On the other hand, participants responded more favorably to performance monitoring when they believed that they could turn off the monitoring and that only their job-related activities were being evaluated. Also, EPM was viewed more positively when workers were given the opportunity to participate in decisions regarding the use of the system. Results support that the effect of social facilitation is not just limited to the physical presence of others, but also extends to presence in a virtual sense as well.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 2009, Thompson, Sebastienelli and Murray conducted an experiment to determine the effect of electronic monitoring on students who used web-based training to learn new online search skills. They found that participants who were explicitly told that their training was being monitored performed markedly worse on a post-training skills test than participants who were unaware that their training was being monitored. These findings adhere to the basic premise of social facilitation and reveal that the heightened awareness of evaluation on complex tasks significantly hinders performance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== In educational settings ==

Groups are formed in a variety of educational settings around the world. Some examples include a group of physics students completing a laboratory exercise, a team of touch rugby players, a set of high school prefects, a group of students formed to brainstorm ideas for energy saving techniques, and [[study group]]s.

Some groups enhance members' motivation and help students stay focused on their academic goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillies|first=R.M.|title=Cooperative learning: Integrating theory and practice.|date=2007|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a study group may inhibit the acquisition of new information, concepts, and skills, as the presence of others can be distracting. These distractions can interfere during the early phases of learning, both in overt and covert practicing. In a study in which participants had to learn a list of words, they were too embarrassed to rehearse the material out aloud and as a consequence of this group pressure, their performance suffered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Berger|first= Seymour M.|last2= Hampton|first2= Katherine L.|last3= Carli|first3= Linda L.|last4= Grandmaison|first4= Paul S.|last5= Sadow|first5= Janice S.|last6= Donath|first6= Clifford H.|last7= Herschlag|first7= Laura R.|title= Audience-Induced Inhibition of Overt Practice During Learning|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date= 1981|volume= 40|issue= 3|pages= 479–491|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.40.3.479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zajonc suggested that the student study alone, preferably in an isolated cubicle, and arrange to write examinations surrounded by many other students, on stage, and in the presence of a large audience. The results of the examination would be beyond the student's wildest expectations, assuming that the material had been thoroughly learned beforehand.&lt;ref name=Zajonc1965/&gt;

==Contributing factors==
Contributing factors to the audience effect could include what kind of crowd is present, such as a supportive crowd (e.g., the crowd at a team's home ground) or a hostile crowd (e.g., the crowd when a team is playing an away game). Also, the proximity of the crowd or the size of the crowd could influence the result of the audience effect. More factors such as nature of the task, coping skills with potential negative effects of audience, and even the playing venue (home or away) could be things to consider when examining the audience effect.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

Social facilitation is a widespread phenomenon in society. Many public tasks demonstrate the effects, both the costs and benefits, of social facilitation. From taking exams in a high school or college environment to performing in sporting events, people may perform better or fall short depending on the task's complexity. In many experiments, people display signs of social facilitation even in everyday tasks, such as driving. This effect can even be seen in animals, as displayed by Zajonc, Heingarter, and Herman's study on cockroaches.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Business can also use social facilitation to their advantage, specifically in online auctions, which takes into the account the emergence of instant messaging and communication availability technologies. The interaction between buyers and sellers in traditional, face-to-face markets creates phenomena such as social facilitation, where the presence of others impacts behaviour and performance. In the study involving Java-based Internet Dutch auction, the findings indicated that social facilitation does indeed occur and participants improve their results and stay longer in the auction under conditions of higher virtual presence. Participants also indicate a preference for auction arrangements with higher degrees of virtual presence.&lt;ref name="Rafaeli, S 2002"/&gt;

== Controversies ==

Social facilitation's definition and explanations are not without controversy. Social psychologists first debate whether social facilitation in humans can be through mere presence, or whether it must be through evaluation. It was concluded that although the influence of the mere presence of others can be easily concealed by many other complex social factors, it is one of the variables that contributes to the power of others to influence an individual's performance.&lt;ref name="Markus1978"/&gt;

One of the greatest controversies surrounding social facilitation is its origination. Psychologists continue to debate whether social facilitation is adopted through the innate biology of humans and animals, or through social learning, either from interaction with society or from individual interaction with other people, and not society in general. Further research and expansion of experiments and theories may begin to resolve, or further complicate, these issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = Do-Yeong | last2 = Park | first2 = Junsu | year = 2010 | title = Cultural differences in risk: The group facilitation effect | url = | journal = Judgment and Decision Making | volume = 5 | issue = 5| pages = 380–390 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of certain weaknesses and inadequacies of drive theory explanation, social facilitation is argued to be in need for a more cognitive approach. A more cognitive model constructed in an expectancy theory framework is shown as a plausible alternative explanation for employee performance and the effects of social facilitation. While there is not much evidence presented by this controversy it is recommended that direction of future research should test this model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Beehr, Terry A.|author2=Ferris, Gerald R.|author3=Gilmore, David C.|year=1978|title=Social Facilitation: A Review and Alternative Conceptual Model|journal=The Academy of Management Review|volume=3|issue=2|pp=338–347|jstor=257673|doi=10.5465/amr.1978.4295344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, there is difficulty in determining which social facilitation approach is the most accurate. The biggest conflict comes between the activation (or mere presence) and evaluation approaches, with the activation approach stating that the mere presence of an audience leads to social facilitation, and the evaluation approach stating that it is the fear of being judged by a capable audience that leads to social facilitation. Despite the two clearly conflicting schools of thought, researchers have not been able to conclusively prove which one is correct.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{Network Science}}
A '''social network ''' is a [[social structure]] made up of a set of [[social]] actors (such as individuals or organizations), sets of [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] ties, and other [[Social relation|social interaction]]s between actors. The social network perspective provides a set of methods for analyzing the structure of whole social entities as well as a variety of theories explaining the patterns observed in these structures.&lt;ref name="WF94CH1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wasserman |first1=Stanley | author-link1= Stanley Wasserman|last2=Faust |first2=Katherine |year=1994 |title=Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications |isbn=9780521387071 |chapter=Social Network Analysis in the Social and Behavioral Sciences |pages=1–27 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of these structures uses [[social network analysis]] to identify local and global patterns, locate influential entities, and examine network dynamics.

Social networks and the analysis of them is an inherently [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] academic field which emerged from [[social psychology]], [[sociology]], [[statistics]], and [[graph theory]]. [[Georg Simmel]] authored early structural theories in sociology emphasizing the dynamics of triads and "web of group affiliations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott |first1=W.

Together with other [[complex network]]s, it forms part of the nascent field of [[network science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science |year=2009 |volume=323 |number=5916 |pages=892–895 |doi=10.1126/science.1165821 |pmid=19213908 |title=Network Analysis in the Social Sciences |first1=Stephen P. |last1=Borgatti |first2=Ajay |last2=Mehra |first3=Daniel J. |last3=Brass |first4=Giuseppe |last4=Labianca|bibcode=2009Sci...323..892B |citeseerx=10.1.1.536.5568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EK"&gt;{{cite book|title=Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World |first1=David |last1=Easley |first2=Jon |last2=Kleinberg |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |chapter=Overview |pages=1–20 |isbn=978-0-521-19533-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Barabasi Albert model.gif|thumb|left|Evolution graph of a social network: [[Barabási–Albert model|Barabási model]].]]

The social network is a [[Scientific theory|theoretical]] [[Construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] useful in the [[social sciences]] to study relationships between individuals, [[social groups|groups]], [[formal organizations|organizations]], or even entire [[society|societies]] ([[social unit]]s, see [[Differentiation (sociology)|differentiation]]). The term is used to describe a [[social structure]] determined by such [[social interactions|interactions]]. The ties through which any given social unit connects represent the convergence of the various social contacts of that unit. This theoretical approach is, necessarily, relational.  An [[axiom]] of the social network approach to understanding [[social interaction]] is that social phenomena should be primarily conceived and investigated through the properties of relations between and within units, instead of the properties of these units themselves. Thus, one common criticism of social network theory is that [[Agency (sociology)|individual agency]] is often ignored&lt;ref name="jscott"&gt;Scott, John P. (2000). ''Social Network Analysis: A Handbook'' (2nd edition). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; although this may not be the case in practice (see [[agent-based model]]ing). Precisely because many different types of relations, singular or in combination, form these network configurations, [[Network science|network analytics]] are useful to a broad range of research enterprises. In social science, these fields of study include, but are not limited to [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[communication studies]], [[economics]], [[geography]], [[information science]], [[organizational studies]], [[social psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[sociolinguistics]].

==History==
In the late 1890s, both [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] foreshadowed the idea of social networks in their theories and research of [[social group]]s. Tönnies argued that social groups can exist as personal and direct social ties that either link individuals who share values and belief (''[[Gemeinschaft]]'', German, commonly translated as "[[community]]") or impersonal, formal, and instrumental social links (''[[Gesellschaft]]'', German, commonly translated as "[[society]]").&lt;ref&gt;Tönnies, Ferdinand (1887). ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'', Leipzig: Fues's Verlag. (Translated, 1957 by Charles Price Loomis as ''Community and Society'', East Lansing: Michigan State University Press.)&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim gave a non-individualistic explanation of social facts, arguing that social phenomena arise when interacting individuals constitute a reality that can no longer be accounted for in terms of the properties of individual actors.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Emile (1893). ''De la division du travail social: étude sur l'organisation des sociétés supérieures'', Paris: F. Alcan. (Translated, 1964, by Lewis A. Coser as ''The Division of Labor in Society'', New York: Free Press.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Simmel]], writing at the turn of the twentieth century, pointed to the nature of networks and the effect of network size on interaction and examined the likelihood of interaction in loosely knit networks rather than groups.&lt;ref&gt;Simmel, Georg (1908). ''Soziologie'', Leipzig: Duncker &amp; Humblot.&lt;/ref&gt;

London: Cohen and West.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sociology]], the early (1930s) work of [[Talcott Parsons]] set the stage for taking a relational approach to understanding social structure.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Talcott ([1937] 1949).

''The Social System''. New York: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, drawing upon Parsons' theory, the work of sociologist [[Peter Blau]] provides a strong impetus for analyzing the relational ties of social units with his work on [[social exchange theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Peter (1956). ''Bureaucracy in Modern Society''. New York: Random House, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Peter (1960). "A Theory of Social Integration".

By the 1970s, a growing number of scholars worked to combine the different tracks and traditions. One group consisted of sociologist [[Harrison White]] and his students at the [[Harvard Department of Social Relations|Harvard University Department of Social Relations]]. Also independently active in the Harvard Social Relations department at the time were [[Charles Tilly]], who focused on networks in political and community sociology and social movements, and [[Stanley Milgram]], who developed the "six degrees of separation" thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semioticon.com/semiotix/semiotix14/sem-14-05.html |title=The Networked Individual: A Profile of Barry Wellman |author=Bernie Hogan}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Granovetter]]&lt;ref name="Introduction for the French Reader"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Granovetter | first1 = Mark | year = 2007 | title = Introduction for the French Reader | url = | journal = Sociologica | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 1–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barry Wellman]]&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, Barry (1988).

Beginning in the late 1990s, social network analysis experienced work by sociologists, political scientists, and physicists such as [[Duncan J. Watts]], [[Albert-László Barabási]], [[Peter Bearman]], [[Nicholas A. Christakis]], [[James H. Fowler]], and others, developing and applying new models and methods to emerging data available about online social networks, as well as "digital traces" regarding face-to-face networks.

==Levels of analysis==

[[File:Social Network Diagram (large).svg|right|thumb|Centrality]]
In general, social networks are [[self-organization|self-organizing]], [[emergence|emergent]], and [[social complexity|complex]], such that a globally coherent pattern appears from the local interaction of the elements that make up the system.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Mark, Albert-László Barabási and Duncan J. Watts (2006). ''The Structure and Dynamics of Networks'' (Princeton Studies in Complexity). Oxford: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wellman | first1 = Barry | year = 2008 | title = Review: The development of social network analysis: A study in the sociology of science | url = | journal = Contemporary Sociology | volume = 37 | issue = 3| pages = 221–222 | doi=10.1177/009430610803700308}}&lt;/ref&gt; These patterns become more apparent as network size increases. However, a global network analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faust|first=Stanley Wasserman; Katherine|title=Social network analysis : methods and applications|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0521382694|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt; of, for example, all [[interpersonal relationships]] in the world is not feasible and is likely to contain so much [[Information theory|information]] as to be uninformative. Practical limitations of computing power, ethics and participant recruitment and payment also limit the scope of a social network analysis.&lt;ref name="Kadu12"&gt;Kadushin, C. (2012). ''Understanding social networks: Theories, concepts, and findings''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Granovetter, M.|title= Network sampling: Some first steps| year=1976 |pages=1287–1303 |volume=81| issue=6 |journal= American Journal of Sociology | doi=10.1086/226224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nuances of a local system may be lost in a large network analysis, hence the quality of information may be more important than its scale for understanding network properties. Thus, social networks are analyzed at the scale relevant to the researcher's theoretical question. Although [[level of analysis|levels of analysis]] are not necessarily [[Mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]], there are three general levels into which networks may fall: [[Microsociology|micro-level]], [[wikt:meso-|meso-level]], and [[Macrosociology|macro-level]].

===Micro level===
At the micro-level, social network research typically begins with an individual, [[Snowball sampling|snowballing]] as social relationships are traced, or may begin with a small group of individuals in a particular social context.

'''Dyadic level''': A [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]] is a social relationship between two individuals. Network research on dyads may concentrate on [[Structural functionalism|structure]] of the relationship (e.g. multiplexity, strength), [[social equality]], and tendencies toward [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity/mutuality]].

'''Triadic level''': Add one individual to a dyad, and you have a [[Triadic relation|triad]]. Research at this level may concentrate on factors such as [[Independence number|balance]] and [[Vertex-transitive graph|transitivity]], as well as [[social equality]] and tendencies toward [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity/mutuality]].&lt;ref name="Kadu12"/&gt; In the [[balance theory]] of [[Fritz Heider]] the triad is the key to social dynamics. The discord in a rivalrous [[love triangle]] is an example of an unbalanced triad, likely to change to a balanced triad by a change in one of the relations. The dynamics of social friendships in society has been modeled by balancing triads. The study is carried forward with the theory of [[signed graph]]s.

'''Actor level''': The smallest unit of analysis in a social network is an individual in their social setting, i.e., an "actor" or "ego". Egonetwork analysis focuses on network characteristics such as size, relationship strength, density, [[centrality]], [[wikt:prestige|prestige]] and roles such as [[isolates|isolates, liaisons]], and [[Bridge (interpersonal)|bridges]].&lt;ref name="Jone11"/&gt; Such analyses, are most commonly used in the fields of [[psychology]] or [[Social psychology (sociology)|social psychology]], [[ethnographic]] [[kinship]] analysis or other [[genealogy|genealogical]] studies of relationships between individuals.

'''Subset level''': [[Subset]] levels of network research problems begin at the micro-level, but may cross over into the meso-level of analysis. Subset level research may focus on [[Distance (graph theory)|distance]] and reachability, [[cliques]], [[Cohesion (social policy)|cohesive]] subgroups, or other [[Group action (sociology)|group actions]] or [[Group behaviour|behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title="Graph Theoretical Approaches to Social Network Analysis". in Computational Complexity: Theory, Techniques, and Applications (Robert A. Meyers, ed.) | publisher=Springer | author=de Nooy, Wouter |year=2012 | pages=2864–2877 | isbn=978-1-4614-1800-9|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-1800-9_176| chapter=Social Network Analysis, Graph Theoretical Approaches to }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meso level===
In general, meso-level theories begin with a [[Sample population|population]] size that falls between the micro- and macro-levels. However, meso-level may also refer to analyses that are specifically designed to reveal connections between micro- and macro-levels. Meso-level networks are low density and may exhibit causal processes distinct from interpersonal micro-level networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedström | first1 = Peter | last2 = Sandell | first2 = Rickard | last3 = Stern | first3 = Charlotta | year = 2000 | title = Mesolevel Networks and the Diffusion of Social Movements: The Case of the Swedish Social Democratic Party | url = http://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/users/hedstrom/ajs3.pdf | format = PDF | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 106 | issue = 1| pages = 145–172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Social Red.jpg|thumb|right|Social network diagram, meso-level]]

'''Organizations''': Formal [[organizations]] are [[social group]]s that distribute tasks for a collective [[goal]].&lt;ref name="Riketta, M. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Riketta | first1 = M. | last2 = Nienber | first2 = S. | year = 2007 | title = Multiple identities and work motivation: The role of perceived compatibility between nested organizational units | url = | journal = British Journal of Management | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = S61–77 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8551.2007.00526.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Network research on organizations may focus on either intra-organizational or inter-organizational ties in terms of [[Formal organization|formal]] or [[Informal organization|informal]] relationships. Intra-organizational networks themselves often contain multiple levels of analysis, especially in larger organizations with multiple branches, franchises or semi-autonomous departments. In these cases, research is often conducted at a workgroup level and organization level, focusing on the interplay between the two structures.&lt;ref name="Riketta, M. 2007"/&gt;  Experiments with networked groups online have documented ways to optimize group-level coordination through diverse interventions, including the addition of autonomous agents to the groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shirado|first=Hirokazu|last2=Christakis|first2=Nicholas A|title=Locally noisy autonomous agents improve global human coordination in network experiments|journal=Nature|volume=545|issue=7654|pages=370–374|doi=10.1038/nature22332|pmid=28516927|pmc=5912653|bibcode=2017Natur.545..370S|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Randomly distributed networks''': [[Exponential random graph models]] of social networks became state-of-the-art methods of social network analysis in the 1980s. This framework has the capacity to represent social-structural effects commonly observed in many human social networks, including general [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]]-based structural effects commonly observed in many human social networks as well as [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity]] and [[Transitive set|transitivity]], and at the node-level, [[homophily]] and [[Attribute-value system|attribute]]-based activity and popularity effects, as derived from explicit hypotheses about [[Dependency graph|dependencies]] among network ties. [[Parameter]]s are given in terms of the prevalence of small [[Induced subgraph|subgraph]] configurations in the network and can be interpreted as describing the combinations of local social processes from which a given network emerges. These probability models for networks on a given set of actors allow generalization beyond the restrictive dyadic independence assumption of micro-networks, allowing models to be built from theoretical structural foundations of social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cranmer | first1 = Skyler J. | last2 = Desmarais | first2 = Bruce A. | year = 2011 | title = Inferential Network Analysis with Exponential Random Graph Models | url = | journal = Political Analysis | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 66–86 | doi=10.1093/pan/mpq037| citeseerx = 10.1.1.623.751 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scale-free network sample.png|thumb|right|Examples of a random network and a scale-free network. Each graph has 32 nodes and 32 links. Note the "hubs" (shaded) in the scale-free diagram (on the right).]]

'''Scale-free networks''': A [[scale-free network]] is a [[complex network|network]] whose [[degree distribution]] follows a [[power law]], at least [[asymptotic]]ally. In [[network theory]] a scale-free ideal network is a [[random network]] with a [[degree distribution]] that unravels the size distribution of social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moreira, André A., Demétrius R. Paula, Raimundo N. Costa Filho, José S. Andrade, Jr. |title=Competitive cluster growth in complex networks |year=2006 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.73.065101 |pmid=16906890 |journal=Physical Review E |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=065101 |arxiv=cond-mat/0603272 |bibcode=2006PhRvE..73f5101M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific characteristics of scale-free networks vary with the theories and analytical tools used to create them, however, in general, scale-free networks have some common characteristics. One notable characteristic in a scale-free network is the relative commonness of [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] with a [[Maximum degree|degree]] that greatly exceeds the average. The highest-degree nodes are often called "hubs", and may serve specific purposes in their networks, although this depends greatly on the social context. Another general characteristic of scale-free networks is the [[clustering coefficient]] distribution, which decreases as the node degree increases. This distribution also follows a [[power law]].&lt;ref&gt;Barabási, Albert-László (2003). ''Linked: how everything is connected to everything else and what it means for business, science, and everyday life''. New York: Plum.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Barabási–Albert model|Barabási]] model of network evolution shown above is an example of a scale-free network.

===Macro level===
Rather than tracing interpersonal interactions, macro-level analyses generally trace the outcomes of interactions, such as [[economic]] or other [[resource]] [[Transfer function|transfer]] interactions over a large [[Sample population|population]].

[[File:Diagram of a social network.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram: section of a large-scale social network]]

'''Large-scale networks''': [[Large-scale macroeconometric model|Large-scale network]] is a term somewhat synonymous with "macro-level" as used, primarily, in [[social science|social]] and [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] sciences, in [[economics]]. Originally, the term was used extensively in the [[computer sciences]] (see [[Network mapping#Large-scale mapping project|large-scale network mapping]]).

'''Complex networks''': Most larger social networks display features of [[social complexity]], which involves substantial non-trivial features of [[network topology]], with patterns of complex connections between elements that are neither purely regular nor purely random (see, [[complexity science]], [[dynamical system]] and [[chaos theory]]), as do [[biological]], and [[Computer network|technological networks]]. Such [[complex network]] features include a heavy tail in the [[degree distribution]], a high [[clustering coefficient]], [[assortativity]] or disassortativity among vertices, [[community structure]] (see [[stochastic block model]]), and [[hierarchy|hierarchical structure]]. In the case of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency-directed]] networks these features also include [[Reciprocity in network|reciprocity]], triad significance profile (TSP, see [[network motif]]), and other features. In contrast, many of the mathematical models of networks that have been studied in the past, such as [[lattice graph|lattices]] and [[random graph]]s, do not show these features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strogatz, Steven H.|year=2001|title=Exploring complex networks|journal=Nature|volume=410|pages=268–276|doi=10.1038/35065725|pmid=11258382|issue=6825|bibcode=2001Natur.410..268S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical links==

===Imported theories===
Various theoretical frameworks have been imported for the use of social network analysis. The most prominent of these are [[Graph theory]], [[Balance theory]], [[Social comparison theory]], and more recently, the [[Social identity approach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Kilduff, M., Tsai, W. |year=2003 |title= Social networks and organisations |publisher=Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous theories===
Few complete theories have been produced from social network analysis. Two that have are [[role theory|Structural Role Theory]] and Heterophily Theory.

The basis of Heterophily Theory was the finding in one study that more numerous weak ties can be important in seeking information and innovation, as cliques have a tendency to have more homogeneous opinions as well as share many common traits. This homophilic tendency was the reason for the members of the cliques to be attracted together in the first place. However, being similar, each member of the clique would also know more or less what the other members knew. To find new information or insights, members of the clique will have to look beyond the clique to its other friends and acquaintances. This is what Granovetter called "the strength of weak ties".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Granovetter, M. |year=1973 |title= The strength of weak ties |journal= American Journal of Sociology |volume=78 |issue=6 |pages= 1360–1380 |doi=10.1086/225469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural holes==
In the context of networks, [[social capital]] exists where people have an advantage because of their location in a network. Contacts in a network provide information, opportunities and perspectives that can be beneficial to the central player in the network. Most social structures tend to be characterized by dense clusters of strong connections.&lt;ref name="Burt 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burt|first=Ronald|title=Structural Holes and Good Ideas|journal=American Journal of Sociology|year=2004|doi=10.1086/421787|volume=110|issue=2|pages=349–399|citeseerx=10.1.1.388.2251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information within these clusters tends to be rather homogeneous and redundant. Non-redundant information is most often obtained through contacts in different clusters.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burt|first=Ronald|title=Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition|year=1992|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; When two separate clusters possess non-redundant information, there is said to be a structural hole between them.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"/&gt; Thus, a network that bridges [[structural holes]] will provide network benefits that are in some degree additive, rather than overlapping. An ideal network structure has a vine and cluster structure, providing access to many different clusters and structural holes.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"/&gt;

Networks rich in structural holes are a form of social capital in that they offer [[Information theory|information]] benefits. The main player in a network that bridges structural holes is able to access information from diverse sources and clusters.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"/&gt; For example, in [[Business networking|business network]]s, this is beneficial to an individual's career because he is more likely to hear of job openings and opportunities if his network spans a wide range of contacts in different industries/sectors. This concept is similar to Mark Granovetter's theory of [[Interpersonal ties|weak ties]], which rests on the basis that having a broad range of contacts is most effective for job attainment.

==Research clusters==

===Communication===
[[Communication Studies]] are often considered a part of both the social sciences and the humanities, drawing heavily on fields such as [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[information science]], [[biology]], [[political science]], and [[economics]] as well as [[rhetoric]], [[literary studies]], and [[semiotics]]. Many communication concepts describe the transfer of information from one source to another, and can thus be conceived of in terms of a network.

===Community===
In J.A. Barnes' day, a "[[community]]" referred to a specific geographic location and studies of community ties had to do with who talked, associated, traded, and attended church with whom. Today, however, there are extended "online" communities developed through [[telecommunications]] devices and [[social network services]]. Such devices and services require extensive and ongoing maintenance and analysis, often using [[network science]] methods. [[Community development]] studies, today, also make extensive use of such methods.

===Complex networks===
[[Complex networks]] require methods specific to modelling and interpreting [[social complexity]] and [[complex adaptive system]]s, including techniques of [[dynamic network analysis]].
Mechanisms such as [[Dual-phase evolution#social networks|Dual-phase evolution]] explain how temporal changes in connectivity contribute to the formation of structure in social networks.

===Criminal networks===
In [[criminology]] and [[urban sociology]], much attention has been paid to the social networks among criminal actors. For example, Andrew Papachristos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Papachristos |first=Andrew |year=2009 |title=Murder by Structure: Dominance Relations and the Social Structure of Gang Homicide |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=74–128 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.855304 |url=http://www.papachristos.org/Publications_2_files/ajs_final_version.pdf |accessdate=29 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407094725/http://www.papachristos.org/Publications_2_files/ajs_final_version.pdf |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has studied gang murders as a series of exchanges between gangs. Murders can be seen to diffuse outwards from a single source, because weaker gangs cannot afford to kill members of stronger gangs in retaliation, but must commit other violent acts to maintain their reputation for strength.

===Diffusion of innovations===
[[Diffusion of innovations|Diffusion of ideas and innovations]] studies focus on the spread and use of ideas from one actor to another or one [[culture]] and another. This line of research seeks to explain why some become "early adopters" of ideas and innovations, and links social network structure with facilitating or impeding the spread of an innovation.

===Demography===
In [[demography]], the study of social networks has led to new sampling methods for estimating and reaching populations that are hard to enumerate (for example, homeless people or intravenous drug users.) For example, respondent driven sampling is a network-based sampling technique that relies on respondents to a survey recommending further respondents.

===Economic sociology===
The field of [[sociology]] focuses almost entirely on networks of outcomes of social interactions. More narrowly, [[economic sociology]] considers behavioral interactions of individuals and groups through [[social capital]] and social "markets". Sociologists, such as Mark Granovetter, have developed core principles about the interactions of social structure, information, ability to punish or reward, and trust that frequently recur in their analyses of political, economic and other institutions. Granovetter examines how social structures and social networks can affect economic outcomes like hiring, price, productivity and innovation and describes sociologists' contributions to analyzing the impact of social structure and networks on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Granovetter, Mark (2005). "The Impact of Social Structure on Economic Outcomes". ''The Journal of Economic Perspectives'', [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4134991 19(1): 33–50]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
Analysis of social networks is increasingly incorporated into [[health care analytics]], not only in [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies but also in models of [[Health Communication|patient communication]] and education, disease prevention, mental health diagnosis and treatment, and in the study of health care organizations and [[health care systems|systems]].&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Judith and Bernice Pescosolido (2002). ''Social Networks and Health''. Boston, MA: JAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human ecology===
[[Human ecology]] is an [[interdisciplinary]] and [[transdisciplinary]] study of the relationship between [[human]]s and their [[natural environment|natural]], [[Social environment|social]], and [[built environment]]s. The scientific philosophy of human ecology has a diffuse history with connections to [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[zoology]], and natural [[ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;Crona, Beatrice and Klaus Hubacek (eds.) (2010). [http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/issues/view.php?sf=48 "Special Issue: Social network analysis in natural resource governance"].

[http://rs.resalliance.org/2010/11/03/reading-list-using-social-network-analysis-sna-in-social-ecological-studies/ ''Resilience Science'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language and linguistics===
Studies of [[language]] and [[linguistics]], particularly [[evolutionary linguistics]], focus on the development of [[Morphology (linguistics)|linguistic forms]] and transfer of changes, [[Phonology|sounds]] or words, from one language system to another through networks of social interaction. Social networks are also important in [[language shift]], as groups of people add and/or abandon languages to their repertoire.

===Literary networks===
In the study of literary systems, network analysis has been applied by Anheier, Gerhards and Romo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anheier | first1 = H. K. | last2 = Romo | first2 = F. P. | year = 1995 | title = Forms of capital and social structure of fields: examining Bourdieu's social topography | url = | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 100 | issue = 4| pages = 859–903 | doi=10.1086/230603}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Nooy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Nooy | first1 = W | year = | title = Fields and networks: Correspondence analysis and social network analysis in the framework of Field Theory | url = | journal = Poetics | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 305–327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Senekal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Senekal | first1 = B. A. | year = 2012 | title = Die Afrikaanse literêre sisteem: ŉ Eksperimentele benadering met behulp van Sosiale-netwerk-analise (SNA) | url = | journal = LitNet Akademies | volume = 9 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to study various aspects of how literature functions. The basic premise is that polysystem theory, which has been around since the writings of [[Even-Zohar]], can be integrated with network theory and the relationships between different actors in the literary network, e.g. writers, critics, publishers, literary histories, etc., can be mapped using [[Computer graphics (computer science)|visualization]] from SNA.

===Organizational studies===
Research studies of [[Formal organization|formal]] or [[informal organization]] [[Social relation|relationships]], [[organizational communication]], [[economics]], [[economic sociology]], and other [[resource]] [[Transfer function|transfers]]. Social networks have also been used to examine how organizations interact with each other, characterizing the many [[Interlocking directorate|informal connections]] that link executives together, as well as associations and connections between individual employees at different organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Podolny | first1 = J.

===Social capital===
[[Social capital]] is a form of [[Capital (economics)|economic]] and [[cultural capital]] in which social networks are central, [[Stock and flow|transactions]] are marked by [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]], [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], and [[cooperation]], and [[Market (economics)|market]] [[Agent (economics)|agents]] produce [[goods and services]] not mainly for themselves, but for a [[common good]].

Social capital is a sociological concept about the value of [[social relation]]s and the role of cooperation and confidence to achieve positive outcomes. The term refers to the value one can get from their social ties. For example, newly arrived immigrants can make use of their social ties to established migrants to acquire jobs they may otherwise have trouble getting (e.g., because of unfamiliarity with the local language). A positive relationship exists between social capital and the intensity of social network use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sebastián|first=Valenzuela|author2=Namsu Park |author3=Kerk F. Kee |title=Is There Social Capital in a Social Network Site?

===Network position and benefits===
In many [[Formal organizations|organizations]], members tend to focus their activities inside their own groups, which stifles creativity and restricts opportunities. A player whose network bridges structural holes has an advantage in detecting and developing rewarding opportunities.&lt;ref name="Burt 2004"/&gt; Such a player can mobilize social capital by acting as a "broker" of information between two clusters that otherwise would not have been in contact, thus providing access to new ideas, opinions and opportunities. British philosopher and political economist [[John Stuart Mill]], writes, "it is hardly possible to overrate the value ... of placing human beings in contact with persons dissimilar to themselves.... Such communication [is] one of the primary sources of progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mill|first=John|title=Principles of Political Economy|year=1909|publisher=William J Ashley|location=Library of Economics and Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a player with a network rich in structural holes can add value to an organization through new ideas and opportunities. This in turn, helps an individual's career development and advancement.

A social capital broker also reaps control benefits of being the facilitator of information flow between contacts. In the case of consulting firm Eden McCallum, the founders were able to advance their careers by bridging their connections with former big three consulting firm consultants and mid-size industry firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gardner|first=Heidi|author2=Eccles, Robert |title=Eden McCallum: A Network Based Consulting Firm|journal=Harvard Business School Review|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By bridging structural holes and mobilizing social capital, players can advance their careers by executing new opportunities between contacts.

There has been research that both substantiates and refutes the benefits of information brokerage. A study of high tech Chinese firms by Zhixing Xiao found that the control benefits of structural holes are "dissonant to the dominant firm-wide spirit of cooperation and the information benefits cannot materialize due to the communal sharing values" of such organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Xiao, Zhixing; Tsui, Anne (2007). "When Brokers May Not Work: The Cultural Contingency of [http://iniciarsesionentrar.com/facebook/ Social] Capital in Chinese High-tech Firms". ''Administrative Science Quarterly''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study only analyzed Chinese firms, which tend to have strong communal sharing values. Information and control benefits of structural holes are still valuable in firms that are not quite as inclusive and cooperative on the firm-wide level. In 2004, Ronald Burt studied 673 managers who ran the supply chain for one of America's largest electronics companies. He found that managers who often discussed issues with other groups were better paid, received more positive job evaluations and were more likely to be promoted.&lt;ref name="Burt 2004"/&gt; Thus, bridging structural holes can be beneficial to an organization, and in turn, to an individual's career.

===Social media===
{{main article|Social media}}
[[Computer network]]s combined with social networking software produces a new medium for social interaction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The International Encyclopedia of Media Effects|last=Amichai-Hamburger|first=Yair|last2=Hayat|first2=Tsahi|date=2017|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=9781118783764|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118783764.wbieme0170}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A relationship over a computerized [[social networking service]] can be characterized by context, direction, and strength. The content of a relation refers to the resource that is exchanged. In a [[computer mediated communication]] context, social pairs exchange different kinds of information, including sending a data file or a computer program as well as providing emotional support or arranging a meeting. With the rise of [[electronic commerce]], information exchanged may also correspond to exchanges of money, goods or services in the "real" world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Studying Online Social Networks | author=Garton, Laura, [[Caroline Haythornthwaite]], and [[Barry Wellman]] | journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |date=23 June 2006 | volume=3 | issue=1 |pages = 0| doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.1997.tb00062.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social network analysis]] methods have become essential to examining these types of computer mediated communication.

In addition, the sheer size and the volatile nature of [[social media]] has given rise to new network metrics. A key concern with networks extracted from social media is the lack of robustness of network metrics given missing data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wei | first1 = Wei | last2 = Joseph | first2 = Kenneth | last3 = Liu | first3 = Huan | last4 = Carley | first4 = Kathleen M. | year = 2016 | title = Exploring Characteristics of Suspended Users and Network Stability on Twitter | url = | journal = Social Network Analysis and Mining | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10956">In the theory of [[general relativity]], a '''stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor''', such as the '''Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor''', is an extension of the non-gravitational [[stress–energy tensor]] which incorporates the [[energy–momentum]] of gravity. It allows the [[energy–momentum]] of a system of gravitating matter to be defined. In particular it allows the total of matter plus the gravitating energy–momentum to form a [[conserved current]] within the framework of [[general relativity]], so that the ''total'' energy–momentum crossing the [[hypersurface]] (3-dimensional boundary) of ''any'' compact [[space–time]] [[hypervolume]] (4-dimensional submanifold) vanishes.

Some people (such as [[Erwin Schrödinger]]{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}) have objected to this derivation on the grounds that [[pseudotensor]]s are inappropriate objects in general relativity, but the conservation law only requires the use of the 4-[[divergence]] of a pseudotensor which is, in this case, a tensor (which also vanishes). Also, most pseudotensors are sections of [[jet bundle]]s, which are now recognized as perfectly valid objects in GR.

==Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor&lt;!--'Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor' and 'Landau-Lifshitz pseudotensor' redirect here--&gt;==
The use of the '''Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, a stress–energy–momentum [[pseudotensor]] for combined matter (including photons and neutrinos) plus gravity,&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;[[Lev Davidovich Landau]] and [[Evgeny Mikhailovich Lifshitz]], ''The Classical Theory of Fields'', (1951), Pergamon Press, {{ISBN|7-5062-4256-7}} chapter 11, section #96&lt;/ref&gt; allows the energy–momentum conservation laws to be extended into [[general relativity]].  Subtraction of the matter [[stress–energy–momentum tensor]] from the combined pseudotensor results in the gravitational stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor.

===Requirements===
[[Lev Davidovich Landau|Landau]] and [[Evgeny Mikhailovich Lifshitz|Lifshitz]] were led by four requirements in their search for a gravitational energy momentum pseudotensor, &lt;math&gt;t_{LL}^{\mu \nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name="LL"/&gt;
# that it be constructed entirely from the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]], so as to be purely geometrical or gravitational in origin.
# that it be index symmetric, i.e. &lt;math&gt;t_{LL}^{\mu \nu} = t_{LL}^{\nu \mu} \,&lt;/math&gt;, (to conserve [[angular momentum]])
# that, when added to the [[stress–energy tensor]] of matter, &lt;math&gt;T^{\mu \nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;, its total 4-[[divergence]] vanishes (this is required of any [[conserved current]]) so that we have a conserved expression for the total stress–energy–momentum.
# that it vanish locally in an [[inertial frame of reference]] (which requires that it only contains first and not second or higher [[derivative]]s of the metric). This is because the [[equivalence principle]] requires that the gravitational force field, the [[Christoffel symbols]], vanish locally in some frame. If gravitational energy is a function of its force field, as is usual for other forces, then the associated gravitational pseudotensor should also vanish locally.

===Definition===
Landau &amp; Lifshitz showed that there is a unique construction that satisfies these requirements, namely

:&lt;math&gt;t_{LL}^{\mu \nu} = - \frac{c^4}{8\pi G}G^{\mu \nu} + \frac{c^4}{16\pi G (-g)}((-g)(g^{\mu \nu}g^{\alpha \beta} - g^{\mu \alpha}g^{\nu \beta}))_{,\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

* ''G''&lt;sup&gt;μν&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[Einstein tensor]] (which is constructed from the metric)
* ''g''&lt;sup&gt;μν&lt;/sup&gt; is the inverse of the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]]
* ''g''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;det(''g''&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;) is the [[determinant]] of the metric tensor and is &lt; 0.  Hence its appearance as &lt;math&gt;-g &lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;,_{\alpha \beta} =  \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^{\alpha} \partial x^{\beta}}\,&lt;/math&gt; are [[partial derivative]]s, not [[covariant derivative]]s.
* ''G'' is Newton's [[gravitational constant]].

===Verification===
Examining the 4 requirement conditions we can see that the first 3 are relatively easy to demonstrate:
#Since the Einstein tensor, &lt;math&gt;G^{\mu \nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;, is itself constructed from the metric, so therefore is &lt;math&gt;t_{LL}^{\mu \nu} &lt;/math&gt;
#Since the Einstein tensor, &lt;math&gt;G^{\mu \nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;, is symmetric so is &lt;math&gt;t_{LL}^{\mu \nu} &lt;/math&gt; since the additional terms are symmetric by inspection.
#The Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor is constructed so that when added to the [[stress–energy tensor]] of matter, &lt;math&gt;T^{\mu \nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;, its total 4-[[divergence]] vanishes: &lt;math&gt;((-g)(T^{\mu \nu} + t_{LL}^{\mu \nu}))_{,\mu} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. This follows from the cancellation of the Einstein tensor, &lt;math&gt;G^{\mu \nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;, with the [[stress–energy tensor]], &lt;math&gt;T^{\mu \nu}\,&lt;/math&gt; by the [[Einstein field equations]]; the remaining term vanishes algebraically due the commutativity of partial derivatives applied across antisymmetric indices.
#The Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor appears to include second derivative terms in the metric, but in fact the explicit second derivative terms in the pseudotensor cancel with the implicit second derivative terms contained within the [[Einstein tensor]], &lt;math&gt;G^{\mu \nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;.  This is more evident when the pseudotensor is directly expressed in terms of the metric tensor or the [[Levi-Civita connection]]; only the first derivative terms in the metric survive and these vanish where the frame is locally inertial at any chosen point.  As a result, the entire pseudotensor vanishes locally (again, at any chosen point) &lt;math&gt;t_{LL}^{\mu \nu} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which demonstrates the delocalisation of gravitational energy–momentum.&lt;ref name="LL"/&gt;

===Cosmological constant===
When the Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor was formulated it was commonly assumed that the [[cosmological constant]], &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \,&lt;/math&gt;, was zero.  Nowadays [[accelerating universe|we don't make that assumption]], and the expression needs the addition of a &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \,&lt;/math&gt; term, giving:
:&lt;math&gt;t_{LL}^{\mu \nu} = - \frac{c^4}{8\pi G}(G^{\mu \nu}+\Lambda g^{\mu \nu}) + \frac{c^4}{16\pi G (-g)}((-g)(g^{\mu \nu}g^{\alpha \beta} - g^{\mu \alpha}g^{\nu \beta}))_{,\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt;
This is necessary for consistency with the [[Einstein field equations]].

===Metric and affine connection versions===
Landau &amp; Lifshitz also provide two equivalent but longer expressions for the Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor:

*[[Metric tensor]] version:
:&lt;math&gt;(-g)(t_{LL}^{\mu \nu} + \frac{c^4\Lambda g^{\mu \nu}}{8\pi G}) = \frac{c^4}{16\pi G}((\sqrt{-g}g^{\mu \nu}),_{\alpha }(\sqrt{-g}g^{\alpha \beta}),_{\beta}- &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;- (\sqrt{-g}g^{\mu \alpha }),_{\alpha }(\sqrt{-g}g^{\nu \beta}),_{\beta} +\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu \nu}g_{\alpha \beta}(\sqrt{-g}g^{\alpha \sigma }),_{\rho }(\sqrt{-g}g^{\rho  \beta }),_{ \sigma }-&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;-(g^{\mu \alpha }g_{\beta \sigma }(\sqrt{-g}g^{\nu \sigma }),_{\rho }(\sqrt{-g}g^{\beta \rho }),_{\alpha }+g^{\nu \alpha }g_{\beta \sigma}(\sqrt{-g}g^{\mu \sigma }),_{\rho }(\sqrt{-g}g^{\beta \rho }),_{\alpha })+&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;+g_{\alpha \beta }g^{ \sigma \rho }(\sqrt{-g}g^{\mu \alpha }),_{ \sigma }(\sqrt{-g}g^{\nu \beta }),_{\rho }+\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;+\frac{1}{8}(2g^{\mu \alpha }g^{\nu \beta }-g^{\mu \nu}g^{\alpha \beta })(2g_{ \sigma \rho }g_{\lambda \omega}-g_{\rho \lambda }g_{ \sigma \omega})(\sqrt{-g}g^{ \sigma \omega}),_{\alpha }(\sqrt{-g}g^{\rho \lambda }),_{\beta })&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landau–Lifshitz equation 96.9&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Christoffel symbols|Affine connection]] version:
:&lt;math&gt;t_{LL}^{\mu \nu} + \frac{c^4\Lambda g^{\mu \nu}}{8\pi G}= \frac{c^4}{16\pi G}((2\Gamma^{ \sigma }_{\alpha \beta }\Gamma^{\rho }_{ \sigma \rho }-\Gamma^{ \sigma }_{\alpha \rho }\Gamma^{\rho }_{\beta  \sigma }-\Gamma^{ \sigma }_{\alpha  \sigma }\Gamma^{\rho }_{\beta \rho})(g^{\mu \alpha }g^{\nu \beta }-g^{\mu \nu}g^{\alpha \beta })+&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;+g^{\mu \alpha }g^{\beta  \sigma }(\Gamma^{\nu}_{\alpha \rho }\Gamma^{\rho }_{\beta  \sigma }+\Gamma^{\nu}_{\beta \sigma } \Gamma^{\rho }_{\alpha \rho } - \Gamma^{\nu}_{ \sigma \rho } \Gamma^{\rho }_{\alpha \beta } - \Gamma^{\nu}_{\alpha \beta } \Gamma^{\rho }_{ \sigma \rho })+&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;+g^{\nu \alpha }g^{\beta \sigma }(\Gamma^{\mu}_{\alpha \rho }\Gamma^{\rho }_{\beta \sigma }+\Gamma^{\mu}_{\beta \sigma } \Gamma^{\rho }_{\alpha \rho } - \Gamma^{\mu}_{ \sigma \rho } \Gamma^{\rho }_{\alpha \beta } - \Gamma^{\mu}_{\alpha \beta } \Gamma^{\rho }_{ \sigma \rho })+&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;+g^{\alpha \beta }g^{ \sigma \rho}(\Gamma^{\mu}_{\alpha \sigma } \Gamma^{\nu}_{\beta \rho } - \Gamma^{\mu}_{\alpha \beta } \Gamma^{\nu}_{ \sigma \rho }))&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landau–Lifshitz equation 96.8&lt;/ref&gt;
This definition of energy–momentum is covariantly applicable not just under Lorentz transformations, but also under general coordinate transformations.

==Einstein pseudotensor==
This pseudotensor was originally developed by [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein]] ''Das hamiltonisches Prinzip und allgemeine Relativitätstheorie (The Hamiltonian principle and general relativity).'' Sitzungsber. preuss. Acad. Wiss. 1916, 2, 1111–1116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein]] ''Der Energiesatz in der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie. (An energy conservation law in general relativity).'' Sitzungsber. preuss. Acad. Wiss. 1918, 1, 448–459&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Dirac]] showed&lt;ref&gt;P.A.M.Dirac, ''General Theory of Relativity'' (1975), Princeton University Press, quick presentation of the bare essentials of GTR. {{ISBN|0-691-01146-X}} pages 61&amp;mdash;63&lt;/ref&gt; that the mixed Einstein pseudotensor 
:&lt;math&gt;{t_{\mu}}^{\nu} = \frac{c^4}{16 \pi G \sqrt{-g}} ( (g^{\alpha\beta}\sqrt{-g})_{,\mu} (\Gamma^{\nu}_{\alpha\beta} - \delta^{\nu}_{\beta} \Gamma^{\sigma}_{\alpha\sigma}) - \delta_{\mu}^{\nu} g^{\alpha\beta} (\Gamma^{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta} \Gamma^{\rho}_{\sigma\rho} - \Gamma^{\rho}_{\alpha\sigma} \Gamma^{\sigma}_{\beta\rho})\sqrt{-g} ) &lt;/math&gt;

satisfies a conservation law
:&lt;math&gt;(({T_{\mu}}^{\nu} + {t_{\mu}}^{\nu})\sqrt{-g})_{,\nu} = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly this pseudotensor for gravitational stress–energy is constructed exclusively from the metric tensor and its first derivatives. Consequently, it vanishes at any event when the coordinate system is chosen to make the first derivatives of the metric vanish because each term in the pseudotensor is quadratic in the first derivatives of the metric.  However it is not symmetric, and is therefore not suitable as a basis for defining the angular momentum.

== Background ==
A sustainable landscape is designed to be both attractive and in balance with the local climate and environment and it should require minimal resource inputs. Thus, the design must be “functional, cost-efficient, visually pleasing, environmentally friendly and maintainable" &lt;ref name="ext.colostate.edu"&gt;Colorado State University Extension. http://www.ext.colostate.edu/Pubs/Garden/07243.html. Viewed 11-15-09.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the concept called [[sustainable development]] it pays close attention to the preservation of limited and costly resources, reducing waste and preventing air, water and soil pollution. Landscape Maintenance practices greatly influence the waste produced and the cost of the maintenance itself; such as using electric or gas [[hedge trimmer]]s which degrade plant material rather than using hand shears which create plant longevity, reduce the amount of waste over time, and prevent the misshaping of plant material and eliminates the "Balls and Boxes that unskilled gardeners create.(James Deagan, Prof Cal Poly Pomona Lecture 1980),  In addition, compost, fertilization, grass cycling, pest control measures that avoid or minimize the use of chemicals, [[integrated pest management]], using the right plant in the right place, appropriate use of turf, irrigation efficiency and [[xeriscaping]] or water-wise gardening are all components of sustainable landscaping.&lt;ref name="ciwmb.ca.gov"/&gt;

== Benefits ==
The geographic location can determine what is sustainable due to differences in precipitation and temperature. For example, the [[California Waste Management]] Board emphasizes the link between minimizing environmental damage and maximizing one’s bottom line of urban commercial landscaping companies. In California, the benefits of landscapes often do not outweigh the cost of inputs like water and labor. However, using appropriately selected and properly sited plants may help to ensure that maintenance costs are lower than they otherwise would be due to reduced chemical and water inputs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;California Integrated Waste Management Board. http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Organics/landscaping/ Viewed 11-15-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
There are several programs in place that are open to participation by various groups.

The Sustainable Sites Initiative, the cooperative effort between the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]], the [[Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center]] and the [[United States Botanic Garden]], began in 2005 and will provide a points-based certification for landscapes, similar to the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] program for buildings operated by the [[Green Building Council]]. The Sustainable Sites Initiative now has a document titled Guidelines and Performance Benchmarks.&lt;ref&gt;The Sustainable Sites Initiative. http://www.sustainablesites.org/report/SSI_Guidelines_Draft_2008.pdf. Viewed 9/23/09.&lt;/ref&gt; The credit system is expected to be completed in 2011.

== Proper design ==
The primary step to landscape design is to do a "sustainability audit". This is similar to a landscape site analysis that is typically performed by landscape designers at the beginning of the design process. Factors such as lot size, house size, local covenants and budgets should be considered. The steps to design include a base plan, site inventory and analysis, construction documents, implementation and maintenance.&lt;ref name="ext.colostate.edu"/&gt; Of great importance is considerations related to the growing conditions of the site.  These include orientation to the sun, [[soil type]], wind flow, slopes, shade and climate.  The goal of reducing artificial [[irrigation]] (such as preventing irrigation of landscapes leaving the Los Angeles Basin a Desert again), and reducing use of toxic substances and requires proper plant selection for the specific site.

== Composting ==
{{Main|Composting}}
Composting is a way to recycle kitchen and garden waste while creating inexpensive organic fertilizer for the garden and landscape. Earthworms, microbes and other soil microorganisms feast on such organic matter when provided adequate nitrogen and proper temperatures and moisture. The ideal size for a compost pile or bin is one cubic yard (3' x 3' x 3'). It should be placed in a partly shady location to avoid intense sun and drying out, as this will delay the decomposition process. The pile heats up during the decomposition process, then cools as material is transformed; this is a good time to turn the pile, so that uncomposed materials on the periphery of the pile can be moved to the center to complete the process. With adequate moisture, nitrogen, proper temperature and correct timing of turning the pile, compost can be made in about a 30-day period. Left alone this process will still occur, but may take three to four months under less-than-ideal conditions.

Compost can be added as an amendment to poorly draining soil, as a fertilizer on flower and vegetable beds, to fruit trees or used as a potting soil for potted plants. Trimmings from lawns, trees and shrubs from a large landscape site can be used as feedstock for on-site composting. Reusing on-site organic materials will decrease the need for purchasing other soil additives.

== Irrigation ==
[[Mulch]] may be used to reduce water loss due to [[evaporation]], reduce weeds, minimize [[erosion]], dust and mud problems. Mulch can also add nutrients to the soil when it decomposes. However, mulch is most often used for weed suppression.  Over use of mulch can result in harm to the selected plantings. Care must be taken in the source of the mulch, for instance, black walnut trees result in a toxic mulch product. Grass cycling turf areas (using mulching mowers that leave grass clippings on the lawn) will also decrease the amount of fertilizer needed, reduce landfill waste and reduce costs of disposal.&lt;ref name="ciwmb.ca.gov"/&gt;

A common recommendation is to adding 2-4&amp;nbsp;inches of mulch in flower beds and under trees away from the trunk. Mulch should be applied under trees to the dripline (extension of the branches) in lieu of flowers, [[hosta]]s, [[turf]] or other plants that are often planted there. This practice of planting under trees is detrimental to tree roots, especially when such plants are irrigated to an excessive level that harms the tree. One must be careful not to apply mulch to the bark of the tree.  It can result in smothering, mold and to insect depredation.

The practice of [[xeriscaping]] or water-wise gardening suggests that placing plants with similar water demands together will save time and low-water or drought tolerant plants would be a smart initial consideration.

A homeowner may consider consulting an accredited irrigation technician/auditor and obtain a water audit of current systems. In the event that the situation is difficult to manage, drip or sub-surface irrigation may be most effective. If the system has been in use for over five years, upgrading to [[evapotranspiration]] (ET) controllers, soil sensors and refined control panels will improve the system. Often irrigation heads are in need of readjustment to avoid sprinkling on sidewalks or streets. Business owners may consider developing watering schedules based on historical or actual weather data and soil probes to monitor soil moisture prior to watering.&lt;ref name="ext.colostate.edu"/&gt;

== Building materials ==
{{see also|Sustainable architecture}}
When deciding what kind of building materials to put on a site it is important to recycle as often as possible. Reusing old bricks from sidewalks as patio pavers is one way to provide an aesthetic appeal to an area while reducing what goes to the landfill.

But it is also important to be careful about what materials you use, especially if you plan to grow food crops of any kind. Old telephone poles and railroad ties have usually been treated with a substance called [[creosote]] that can leach into the soils and make any food grown there toxic enough to cause harm to anyone that eats it. In general, you should avoid any kind of treated material, especially wood, that could leach into the soil with rain.&lt;ref name="sustainable-landscape.com"&gt;Sustainable Landscape Design's Custom Design Philosophy. http://www.sustainable-landscape.com/about.html. Viewed 11-15-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (http://www.fscus.org/) was formed in 1993 "to change the dialogue about and the practice of sustainable forestry worldwide." Sustainably harvested lumber - also called [[certified wood]] is now available, in which ecological, economic and social factors are integrated into the management of trees used for lumber.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bearcreeklumber.com/products/intextboth/sustainable.html. Viewed 12-07-09.&lt;/ref&gt; A chain of custody document is used in the certification process.

== Planting selection ==
{{see also|Xeriscaping|Native plant}}
One important part of sustainable landscaping is plant selection. Most of what makes a landscape unsustainable is the amount of inputs required to grow a non-native plant on it. What this means is that a local plant, which has adapted to local climate conditions will require less work on the part of some other agent to flourish. For example, it does not make sense to grow tomatoes in Arizona because there is not enough natural rainfall for them to survive without constant watering. Instead, [[drought-tolerant]] plants like [[succulents]] and [[cacti]] are better suited to survive. Also, by choosing native plants, one can avoid certain problems with insects and pests because these plants will also be adapted to deal with any local invader. The bottom line is that by choosing the right kind of local plants, a great deal of money can be saved on amendment costs, pest control and watering.&lt;ref name="sustainable-landscape.com"/&gt;

Plants used as [[windbreak]]s can save up to 30% on [[heating costs]] in winter. They also help with shading a residence or commercial building in summer, create cool air through evapo-transpiration and can cool hardscaped areas such as driveways and sidewalks.&lt;ref&gt;Farmstead Windbreaks: Planning. http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/PM1716.pdf. Retrieved 12-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

A house surrounded by local trees or bushes enjoys multiple benefits. Plants release [[water vapor]] in the air through [[transpiration]] and water has the ability to reduce temperature extremes in the areas near it (as it boasts very high [[heat capacity]]). The larger and more leafy the plant, the most water vapor it produces. Additionally, the presence of trees is crucial in the creation of stable, healthy and productive ecosystems (such as forests). In fact this is an important principle of [[permaculture]].

If the surrounding trees are chosen to produce edible fruit they can provide a sustainable food source for the occupants of the house. Even if some are fairly demanding (especially in the summer), irrigation is an excellent end-use option in [[greywater]] recycling and [[rainwater harvesting]] systems, and a [[composting toilet]] can cover (at least) some of the [[nutrient]] requirements. Research suggests that diluted human urine might be as effective as chemical fertilizers.{{fact|date=January 2016}} Not all fruit trees are suitable for greywater irrigation, as reclaimed greywater is typically of high pH and [[acidophile]] plants don't do well in alkaline environments.

An intelligent choice for direct energy conservation would be the placement of broadleaf [[deciduous]] trees near the east, west and optionally north-facing walls of the house. Such selection provides shading in the summer while permitting large amounts of heat-carrying solar radiation to strike the house in the winter. The trees are to be placed as closely as possible to the house walls but no closer than 1 meter - otherwise the roots can cause substantial foundation damage. A sustainable house will most likely be equipped with south-facing (north-facing in the S. hemisphere) [[photovoltaic panel]]s and a large, south-facing [[glazing (window)|glazing]] as a result of [[passive solar]] heating design. As the efficiency of both systems is very sensitive to shading, experts suggest the complete absence of trees near the south side.

Another intelligent choice would be that of a dense vegetative fence composed of evergreens (e.g. [[conifer]]s) near that side from which cold continental winds blow (usually north in the N. hemisphere) and also that side from which the [[prevailing winds]] blow (west in temperate regions of both hemispheres). Since north winds are most cold and westerlies blow most often, such choice creates an effective winter windbarrier that prevents very low temperatures outside the house and reduces air infiltration towards the inside. Calculations show that placing the windbrake at a distance twice the height of the trees can reduce the wind velocity by 75%. It then follows that, with some planning, both arrangements (deciduous and evergreen) can be applied simultaneously.&lt;ref name="GF"&gt;"Green from the ground up" by D. Johnston and S. Gibson&lt;/ref&gt;

The above vegetative arrangements come with two disadvantages. Firstly, they minimize air circulation in summer (although in many climates heating is more important and costly than cooling) and, secondly, they may affect the efficiency of photovoltaic panels, thus prompting the need for a shading analysis. However, it has been estimated that if both arrangements are applied properly, they can reduce the overall house energy usage by up to 22%.&lt;ref name="GF" /&gt;

== Maintenance ==
{{see also|Organic gardening}}
'''''Pest Problems'''''

Maintaining plant health will eliminate most pest problems. It is best to start with pest-free plant materials and supplies and close inspection of the plant upon purchase is also recommended. Establishing diversity within the area of plant species will encourage beneficial organism populations (e.g. birds, insects), which feed on potential plant pests. Attracting a wide variety of organisms with a variety of host plants has shown to be effective in increasing pollinator presence in agrarian settings &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=Lorna J.|last2=Brocklehurst|first2=Sarah|last3=Robertson|first3=Duncan|last4=Harrison|first4=William|last5=McCracken|first5=David I.|date=2015-12|title=Riparian buffer strips: Their role in the conservation of insect pollinators in intensive grassland systems|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167880915002327|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment|volume=211|pages=207–220|doi=10.1016/j.agee.2015.06.012|issn=0167-8809}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Because plant pests vary from plant to plant, assessing the problem correctly is half the battle. The owner must consider whether the plant can tolerate the damage caused by the pest. If not, then does the plant value justify some sort of treatment? While pesticide is often chosen to solve the problem, physical barriers and repellents may help. If pesticides are the chosen method, selective organic or natural pesticide is often better because it has less impact on non-target species.&lt;ref name="ext.colostate.edu" /&gt; 

'''''Pruning'''''

Proper pruning will increase air circulation and decrease the likelihood of plant diseases. However, improper pruning is detrimental to shrubs and trees.&lt;ref name="ext.colostate.edu" /&gt; Hedging, topping and shearing of landscape plants causes excessive plant growth. In addition, topping is a hazardous practice which creates a hazardous tree which is highly susceptible to wind damage. Natural pruning techniques during the proper season, on the other hand, promotes healthier, more stable plants.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In temperate areas, deciduous plants should be pruned during dormancy. Plants should never be pruned at the end of a growing season because growth is stimulated and such new growth will be too tender to survive winter freezing temperatures.

'''''Pollution Prevention'''''

Landscape managers should make use of the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) to reduce use of pesticides and herbicides and reduce non-point source solution. As there is considerable debate on the safety levels of nitrates and the impact of fertilizer run-off, more studies are needed in order to determine if the risks justify the outcomes of applying nitrate-ladden fertilizers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powlson|first=David S.|last2=Addiscott|first2=Tom M.|last3=Benjamin|first3=Nigel|last4=Cassman|first4=Ken G.|last5=Kok|first5=De|last6=M|first6=Theo|last7=van Grinsven|first7=Hans|last8=L'hirondel|first8=Jean-Louis|last9=Avery|first9=Alex A.|date=2008-03-01|title=When Does Nitrate Become a Risk for Humans?|url=https://www.agronomy.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/37/2/291|journal=Journal of Environmental Quality|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=291–295|doi=10.2134/jeq2007.0177|pmid=18268290|issn=1537-2537}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Symmetry breaking of escaping ants''' is a phenomenon that happens when [[ant]]s are constrained into a cell with two equivalent exits, and perturbed with an [[insect repellent]]. Contrary to intuition, ants tend to use one door more than the other on average (i.e., there is a  [[symmetry breaking]] in the escape behavior), so they crowd on one of the doors, which decreases the evacuation efficiency.

==Description==

The [[symmetry breaking]] phenomenon arises in experiments described as follows. Worker ants freshly collected from the field are enclosed into a circular cell with a glass cover in such a way that they can only move in two dimensions (i.e., ants cannot pass over each other). The cell has two exits located symmetrically relative to its center. We will describe first a "reference" experiment, and then the one where the "escape [[symmetry]]" is broken.

In the reference experiment, both doors are opened at the same time and let the ants escape. If the experiment is realized many times, in average we see that approximately the same number of ants use the left and the right doors. In this experiment the escape symmetry is not broken.

The second experiment involves a further step before opening the doors: an [[insect repellent]] fluid is poured into the cell at its center through a small hole in the glass cover. As a result, ants get very excited. If the experiment is realized many times, we see that the number of ants escaping by one of the doors (which can be randomly either the left one or the right ones) is significantly higher than the number of ants escaping by the other one, i.e., the escape symmetry is broken. The crowding of ants at one of the doors while the other one may be eventually free results in an inefficient evacuation in terms of time.

Geng Li and coworkers from Beijing Normal University tested whether and how the density of a group influenced symmetry breaking in escaping ants. They used the [[red imported fire ant]] (''Solenopsis invicta'') to repeat the experiment mentioned above with different total number of ants. The result shows that the symmetry breaking increases at low density but decreases after a peak. That is to say, when density is low, the ant group produces a collective escaping behavior; while at high density, the ant group behaves more like random particles.&lt;ref name="Li et al"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = G. | last2 = Huan | first2 = D. | last3 = Roehner | first3 = B. | last4 = Xu | first4 = Y.

== History==

Inspired by earlier computer simulations that predicted a symmetry breaking phenomenon when panicked humans escape from a room with two equivalent exits, E. Altshuler and coworkers from the [[University of Havana]] designed the experiment described in the section above, which revealed the symmetry breaking effect in the leaf-cutting ant ''[[Atta insularis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=E. Altshuler|title=Symmetry breaking in escaping ants|journal=American Naturalist|year=2005 |jstor=498139|doi=10.1086/498139|pmid=16475081|volume=166|issue=6|pages=643–649|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ant ''Atta insularis'' (commonly called ''bibijagua'' in Cuba) displays a high degree of [[swarm intelligence]], like most social insects, which has made them great survivors through millions of years of [[evolution]]. In Cuba, a person may be described as "smarter than ''bibijaguas''" (''"sabe mas que las bibijaguas"''). The poor evacuation efficiency illustrated by the phenomenon of symmetry breaking in escaping ants is one of the few examples where bibijaguas do not seem to behave collectively in a smart way.

==Explanations==

The basic idea is that the action of the repellent induces [[herd behavior]] in the ants. When ants are in "panic", they experience a strong tendency to follow each other. As a result, if a random fluctuation in the system produces a locally large amount of ants trying to reach one of the two doors, the fluctuation can be amplified because ants tend to follow the direction of the majority of individuals. Then, that specific door becomes crowded.

E. Altshuler and coworkers were able to reproduce their symmetry breaking experiments in ants using a simplified version of the theoretical model proposed earlier by Helbing et al. for humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. Helbing.|title= Simulating dynamical features of escape panic|journal=Nature|year=2000 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v407/n6803/full/407487a0.html|volume=407|issue=6803|pages=487–90|doi=10.1038/35035023|pmid=11028994|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the fact that walkers tend to follow the general direction of motion of their neighbors ("[[Vicsek's rule]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=T. Vicsek|title= A new type of phase transition in a system of self-driven particles|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |year=1995 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1226|bibcode=1995PhRvL..75.1226V|volume=75|issue=6|pages=1226–1229|pmid=10060237|display-authors=etal|arxiv=cond-mat/0611743}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and such herd behavior increases as the so-called "panic parameter" increases. In the case of ants, the panic parameter is supposed to be low when no repellent is used, and high when the repellent is used.

A more "biologically-sensible" model based on the deposition of an alarm [[pheromone]] by ants under stress also reproduces the symmetry breaking phenomenon, with the advantage that it also predicts the experimental output for different concentrations of ants in the cell.&lt;ref name="Li et al" /&gt;

The pheromone mechanism shares the key element of the previous models: stressed ants tend to "follow the crowd".

==Ants vs. humans escaping in panic==
From the statistical point of view, human beings and ants seem to behave in a similar way in certain scenarios, such as evacuation from a room or cell under stress, resulting in symmetry breaking phenomena: while ants increase their tendency to follow each other under stress, human beings seem to forget about [[Emergency evacuation]] strategies, and  just run towards the door where most people run to. However, the enormous physical and behavioural differences between humans and ants imply also big differences in their [[collective behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=C. Detrain and J.-L. Deneubourg|title=Self-organized structures in a super-organism: do ants "behave" like molecules?|journal=Physics of Life Reviews |year=2006 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571064506000200|doi=10.1016/j.plrev.2006.07.001|volume=3|issue=3|pages=162–187|bibcode=2006PhLRv...3..162D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=S. Boari|title=Efficient egress of escaping ants stressed with temperature|journal=PLOS ONE |volume=8|issue=11|pages=e81082|year=2014 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0081082&amp;representation=PDF|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0081082|pmid=24312264|pmc=3843683|bibcode=2013PLoSO...881082B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the symmetry breaking experiment on ants, for example, the individuals are relatively "polite": rarely ants are crushed by other ants in the process or evacuation. When humans are in panic, however, deaths by overpressure or suffocation are common, like in the case of the [[Love Parade disaster]] occurred in [[Germany]] in 2010.

Videos on symmetry breaking in escaping ants are available on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PANICAntsEng| author=Complexperiments |year=2012 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rz8LNesxGs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black played a key role in the development of the guidance, navigation and control of the U.S. Navy's Transit satellite system at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratories.

Given the knowledge of two vectors in the reference and body coordinates of a satellite, the TRIAD algorithm obtains the direction cosine matrix relating both frames. Covariance analysis for Black's classical solution was subsequently provided by Markley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Markley|first=Landis|title=Attitude Determination Using Vector Observations: A Fast Optimal Matrix Algorithm|journal=The Journal of Astronautical Sciences|date=April–June 1993|volume=41|issue=2|pages=261–280|url=http://www.malcolmdshuster.com/FC_Markley_1993_J_FOAM_JAS_MDSscan.pdf|accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
We consider the linearly independent reference vectors &lt;math&gt;\vec{R}_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{R}_2 &lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt; \vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2&lt;/math&gt; be the corresponding measured directions of the reference unit vectors as resolved in a body fixed frame of reference. Then they are related by the equations,

{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt; 
\vec{R}_i = A \vec{r}_i 
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

for &lt;math&gt; i = 1,2 &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is a rotation matrix (sometimes also known as a proper [[orthogonal matrix]], i.e., &lt;math&gt;A^{T}A = I, det(A) = +1 &lt;/math&gt;). &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; transforms vectors in the body fixed frame into the frame of the reference vectors. Among other properties, rotational matrices preserve the length of the vector they operate on. Note that the direction cosine matrix &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; also transforms the cross product vector, written as,

{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt; 
\vec{R}_1 \times \vec{R}_2 = A \left( \vec{r}_1 \times \vec{r}_2 \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Triad proposes an estimate of the direction cosine matrix &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; as a solution to the linear system equations given by

{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;
\left[ \vec{R}_1 ~\vdots~ \vec{R}_2 ~\vdots~ \left(\vec{R}_1 \times \vec{R}_2 \right) \right] = A \left[ \vec{r}_1 ~\vdots~ \vec{r}_2 ~\vdots~ \left( \vec{r}_1 \times \vec{r}_2 \right) \right]
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

where &lt;math&gt; \vdots &lt;/math&gt; have been used to separate different column vectors.

The solution presented above works well in the noise-free case. However, in practice, &lt;math&gt; \vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2 &lt;/math&gt; are noisy and the orthogonality condition of the attitude matrix (or the direction cosine matrix) is not preserved by the above procedure. Triad incorporates the following elegant procedure to redress this problem. To this end, we define unit vectors

{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;
\hat{S} = \frac{\vec{R}_1}{|| \vec{R}_1||} 
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|4}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;
\hat{s} = \frac{\vec{r}_1}{||\vec{r}_1||}
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

and

{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;
\hat{M} = \frac{\vec{R}_1 \times \vec{R}_2}{|| \vec{R}_1 \times \vec{R}_2 ||} 
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|6}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;
\hat{m} = \frac{\vec{r}_1 \times \vec{r}_2 }{||\vec{r}_1 \times \vec{r}_2 ||}
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

to be used in place of the first two columns of ({{EquationNote|3}}). Their cross product is used as the third column in the linear system of equations obtaining a proper orthogonal matrix for the spacecraft attitude given by

{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;
\left[ \hat{S} ~ \vdots ~ \hat{M} ~\vdots~ \hat{S} \times \hat{M} \right] = A \left[ \hat{s} ~\vdots~ \hat{m} ~\vdots~ \hat{s} \times \hat{m} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|8}}}}

While the normalizations of Equations ({{EquationNote|4}}) - ({{EquationNote|7}}) are not necessary, they have been carried out to achieve a computational advantage in solving the linear system of equations in ({{EquationNote|8}}). Thus an estimate of the spacecraft attitude is given by the proper orthogonal matrix as 
{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;
\hat{A} = \left[ \hat{S} ~ \vdots ~ \hat{M} ~\vdots~ \hat{S} \times \hat{M} \right] \left[ \hat{s} ~\vdots~ \hat{m} ~\vdots~ \hat{s} \times \hat{m} \right]^T.
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|9}}}}
Note that computational efficiency has been achieved in this procedure by replacing the matrix inverse with a transpose. This is possible because the matrices involved in computing attitude are each composed of a triad of [[Orthonormality|orthonormal]] basis vectors. "TRIAD" derives its name from this observation.

==Triad Attitude Matrix and Handed-ness of Measurements==
It is of consequence to note that the Triad method always produces a proper orthogonal matrix irrespective of the handedness of the reference and body vectors employed in the estimation process. This can be shown as follows.
Let us re-write  Eq. ({{EquationNote|8}}) in a matrix form given by

{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma = A \Delta
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|10}}}}

where  &lt;math&gt;
\Gamma := \left[ \hat{S} ~ \vdots ~ \hat{M} ~\vdots~ \hat{S} \times \hat{M} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;
and 
&lt;math&gt;
\Delta = \left[ \hat{s} ~\vdots~ \hat{m} ~\vdots~ \hat{s} \times \hat{m} \right].
&lt;/math&gt;
Note that if the columns of &lt;math&gt; \Gamma &lt;/math&gt; form a left handed triad, then the columns of &lt;math&gt; \Delta &lt;/math&gt; are also left handed because of the one-one correspondence between the vectors. This is because of the simple fact that, in Euclidean geometry, the angle between any two vectors remains invariant to coordinate transformations. Therefore, the determinant &lt;math&gt; det \left( \Gamma \right) &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; -1 &lt;/math&gt; depending on whether its columns are right or left - handed respectively (similarly, &lt;math&gt; \Delta  = \pm 1&lt;/math&gt; ). Taking determinant on both sides of the relation in Eq. ({{EquationNote|10}}), we conclude that 
{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;
det \left( A \right) = 1.
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|11}}}}
This is quite useful in practical applications since the analyst is always guaranteed a proper orthogonal matrix irrespective of the nature of the reference and measured vector quantities.

==Applications==
Triad was used as an attitude determination technique to process the telemetry data from the Transit satellite system (used by the U.S. Navy for navigation). The principles of the Transit system gave rise to the global positioning system satellite constellation. In an application problem, the reference vectors are usually known directions (e.g., stars, Earth magnetic field, gravity vector, etc.). Body fixed vectors are the measured directions as observed by an on-board sensor (e.g., star tracker, magnetometer, etc.). With advances in micro-electronics, attitude determination algorithms such as Triad have found their place in a variety of devices (e.g., smart phones, cars, tablets, UAVs etc.) with a broad impact on the modern society.

[[File:Yard Sale Northern CA 2005.JPG|thumb|A yard sale is a common place to find cheap used goods.]]

A '''secondhand''' or '''used good''' is a piece of [[personal property]] that is being purchased by or otherwise transferred to a second or later [[end user]]. A ''used'' [[Good (economics and accounting)|good]] can also simply mean it is no longer in the same condition as it was when transferred to the current owner. When the term ''used'' means that an item has expended its purpose (such as a used [[diaper]]), it is typically called [[garbage]], instead. 

Used goods may be transferred informally between friends and family for free as '''hand-me-downs'''.  They may be sold for a fraction of their original price at [[garage sale]]s, in [[bazaar|bazaar-style]] fundraisers, in privately owned consignment shops, or through [[Online auction|online auctions]]. Some things are typically sold in specialized shops, such as a [[Used car dealer|car dealership]] that specializes in the sale of used vehicles or a [[used bookstore]] that sells [[Used book|used books]].  In other cases, such as a [[charity shop]], a wide variety of used goods might be handled by the same establishment.  High-value used luxury goods, such as antique furniture, jewelry, watches, and artwork, might be sold through a generic [[auction house]] such as [[Sotheby's]] or a more specialized niche like [https://www.bobswatches.com Bob's Watches].

Governments require some used goods to be sold through regulated markets, as in the case of items which have safety and legal issues, such as used firearms or cars.  For these items, government licensing bodies require certification and registration of the sale, to prevent the sale of stolen, unregistered, or unsafe goods. For some high-value used goods, such as cars and motorcycles, governments regulate sales of used goods to ensure that the government gets its sales tax revenue from the sale.

==Benefits==
Secondhand goods can benefit the purchaser as the price paid is lower than that of the same items bought new. If the reduction in price more than compensates for the possibly shorter remaining lifetime, lack of warranty, and so on, there is a net benefit.

Selling unwanted goods secondhand instead of discarding them obviously benefits the seller.

[[Recycling]] goods through the secondhand market reduces use of resources in manufacturing new goods, and diminishes waste which must be disposed of, both of which are significant environmental benefits. However, manufacturers who profit from sales of new goods lose corresponding sales. Scientific research shows that buying used goods reduces carbon footprint and [[CO2]] emissions significantly compared to the complete product life cycle, because of less production, raw material sourcing and logistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.citeulike.org/article/9832067|title=Impact of closed-loop network configurations on carbon footprints: A case study in copiers|first=Harold|last=Krikke|date=1 October 2011|publisher=|journal=Resources, Conservation and Recycling|volume=55|issue=12|pages=1196–1205|accessdate=25 May 2018|doi=10.1016/j.resconrec.2011.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the relative carbon footprint of production, raw material sourcing and the [[supply chain]] is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.durabilit.eu/Plone/news/how-to-reduce-your-company2019s-carbon-footprint-2013-by-reuse http://www.durabilit.eu/Plone/news/how-to-reduce-your-company2019s-carbon-footprint-2013-by-reuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083915/http://www.durabilit.eu/Plone/news/how-to-reduce-your-company2019s-carbon-footprint-2013-by-reuse |date=2014-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A scientific methodology has been made to analyze how much CO2 emissions are reduced when buying used goods like secondhand hardware versus new hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.future-science.com/doi/full/10.4155/cmt.11.29 Scientific Greener CO2 calculator for reuse] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130124001944/http://www.future-science.com/doi/full/10.4155/cmt.11.29 |date=2013-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quality secondhand goods can be more durable than equivalent new goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/28/buying-secondhand-an-alternative-to-rampant-consumerism-of-black-friday|title=Buying secondhand: an alternative to rampant consumerism of Black Friday|first1=Sarah|last1=LaBrecque|first2=Hannah|last2=Gould|date=28 November 2014|website=the Guardian|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==
Secondhand goods may have faults which are not apparent even if examined; purchasing sight unseen, for example, from an [[Internet auction]] site, has further unknowns. Goods may cause problems beyond their value; for example, furniture may have not easily seen [[Bed bug (insect)|bedbug]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11915026/ns/dateline_nbc-dont_let_the_bed_bugs_bite/t/what-you-need-know-about-bed-bugs/ Msnbc: What you need to know about bed bugs]: "Do not buy used furniture (especially bedding items or upholstered items) ... until inspected carefully for any signs of bedbugs"&lt;/ref&gt; which may cause an infestation which is difficult and expensive to eradicate. Faulty electrical and mechanical goods can be hazardous and dangerous. This is especially a big issue if sold to countries that do not have recycling facilities for these devices, which has led to an issue with [[electronic waste]].

==Types of transfers==
Many items that are considered obsolete and worthless in [[developed countries]], such as decade-old hand tools and clothes, are useful and valuable in impoverished communities in the country or in [[developing countries]]. Underdeveloped countries like Zambia are extremely welcoming to donated secondhand clothing. At a time when the country's economy was in severe decline, the used goods provided jobs by keeping "many others busy with repairs and alterations".&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004"&gt;Karen Tranberg-Hansen. 2004. Helping or hindering? Controversies around the international second-hand clothing trade. Anthropology Today 20(4):3-9.&lt;/ref&gt; It has created a type of spin-off economy at a time when many Zambians were out of work. The used garments and materials that were donated to the country also allowed for the production of "a wide range of fabrics" whose imports had been previously restricted.&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt; The trade is essentially executed by women who operate their small business based on local associations and networks. Not only does this provide self-employment, but it also increases household income and enhances the economy.&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt; But while many countries would be welcoming of secondhand goods, it is also true that there are countries in need who refuse donated items. Countries like Poland, Philippines and Pakistan have been known to reject secondhand items for "fear of venereal disease and risk to personal hygiene".&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt;  Similar to these countries, India also refuses the [[Global trade of secondhand clothing|import of secondhand clothing]] but will accept the import of wool fibers, including ''mutilated hosiery'' which is a term meaning "woollen garments shredded by machine in the West prior to export".&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt; Through the production of ''[[shoddy]]'' (recycled wool), most of which is produced in Northern India today, unused clothing can be recycled into fibres that are spun into yarn for reuse in 'new' used goods.&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt; 

United States taxpayers can deduct donations of used goods to charitable organizations. Both [[Goodwill Industries]] and the [[The Salvation Army|Salvation Army]] websites have lists of items with their estimated range of values. Another way that people transfer used goods is by giving them to friends or relatives. When a person gives an item of some value that they have used to someone else, such as a used car or a winter coat, it is sometimes referred to as a "hand-me-down".

[[File:Ebayscreen.png|thumb|[[Online auction]] sites have become a popular way to sell used goods in recent years.]]

Used items can often be found for sale in [[thrift store]]s and [[pawnshop]]s, [[auction]]s, [[garage sale]]s, and in more recent times [[online auction]]s. Some stores sell both new and used goods (e.g. [[car dealership]]s), while others only sell new goods but may take used items in exchange for credit toward the purchase of newer goods. For example, some musical instrument stores and high-end audio stores only sell new gear, but they will accept good quality used items as trade ins towards the purchase of new items; after the store purchases the used items, they then sell them using online auctions or other services.

When an item is no longer of use to a person they may sell or ''pawn'' it, especially when they are in need of [[money]]. Items can also be sold (or taken away free of cost) as [[scrap]] (e.g. a broken-down old car will be towed away for free for its scrap metal value). Owners may sell the good themselves or to a dealer who then sells it on for a profit. They may also choose to give it away to another person this is often referred to as [[freecycling]]. However, because the process takes some effort on part of the owner they may simply keep possession of it or dump it at a [[landfill]] instead of going to the trouble of selling it. It has been common to buy secondhand or used good on markets or bazaars for long time. When the web became popular, it became common with websites such as [[eBay]] and [[Yahoo!|Yahoo! Classifieds]].

==Purchases==
[[File:Landfill compactor.jpg|thumb|left|As dumped used goods take up space in landfills, some may purchase them for [[environmentalism|environmental motivations]].]]

The strategy of buying used items is employed by some to save [[money]], as they are typically worth less than the equivalent new items. Purchasing used items for [[reuse]] prevents them from becoming [[waste]] and saves costly production of equivalent new goods. Motivations for purchase include conserving [[natural resource]]s and protecting the [[natural environment|environment]], and may form part of a [[simple living]] plan.

==Types==

===Cars===
{{Main article|Used car}}
[[File:Toyota Corolla AE82 Sweden.JPG|thumb|Used cars like this 1980s-era [[Toyota Corolla]] are very inexpensive, but a buyer runs the risk of getting stuck with a [[Lemon (automobile)|lemon]].]]

Used [[Automobile|cars]] are especially notable for depreciating in value much faster than many other items.  Used cars may have been bought or [[lease]]d by their previous user, and may be purchased directly from the previous owner or through a dealer. [[George Akerlof]] published a paper entitled "[[The Market for Lemons]]", examining the effects of [[information asymmetry]] on the used car market. Used cars may require more maintenance or have fewer features than later equivalent models.

=== Books ===
{{Main|Used book}}
Used books are often re-sold through a [[used bookstore]].  They may also be given away, perhaps as part of a program such as the [[Little Free Library|Little Free Library's]] programs.  Used bookstores may also sell secondhand music recordings or videos.

=== Used clothing ===
In developed countries, unwanted used clothing is often donated to charities that sort and sell it. Some of these distribute some of the clothing to people on low incomes for free or a very low price. Others sell all of the collected clothing in bulk to a commercial used clothing redistributor, and then use the raised funds to finance their activities.&lt;ref name="tsun2007"&gt;[http://www.torontosun.com/News/TorontoAndGTA/2007/01/11/3299397-sun.html Old duds, big bucks; Clothes you think you're donating to charity are frequently sold for profit] [[Toronto Sun]], 2007-Jan-11, retrieved 2007-Apr-16.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., almost 5 billion pounds of clothing is donated to charity shops each year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.racked.com/platform/amp/2018/3/13/17082288/used-clothing-mexico-goodwill|title=Here’s What Really Happens to Your Used Clothes - Racked|last=Guo|first=Eileen|date=13 March 2018|website=Racked|publisher=Vox Media|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only about 10% of it can be re-sold by the charity shops.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; About a third of the donated clothing is bought, usually in bulk and at a heavy discount, by commercial dealers and fabric recyclers, who export it to other countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Some of the used clothes are also smuggled into Mexico.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Used clothing unsuitable for sale in an affluent market may still find a buyer or end-user in another market, such as a student market or a less affluent region of a developing country. In developing countries, such as [[Zambia]], secondhand clothing is sorted, recycled and sometimes redistributed to other nations. Some of the scraps are kept and used to create unique fashions which enable the locals to construct identity. Not only does the trade represent a great source of employment for women as well as men, it also supports other facets of the economy: the merchants buy timber and other materials for their stands, metal hangers to display clothing, and food and drinks for customers. Carriers also find work as they transport the garments from factories to various locations. The secondhand clothing trade is central to the lives of many citizens dwelling in such countries.&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt; A dress agent will often deal with a buyer and seller directly, taking unwanted clothes that still have value, and reselling them in a shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosmood.com/?module=articles&amp;id=1 |title=Second hand by cosmood |publisher=cosmood.com |date=2017-08-02 |accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Importation of used clothing is sometimes opposed by the [[textile industry]] in developing countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They are concerned that fewer people will buy the new clothes that they make when it is cheaper to buy imported used clothing. Nearly all the clothes made in Mexico are intended for export, and the Mexican textile industry opposes the importation of used clothes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Other items ===
The Sierra Club, an environmental organization, argues that secondhand purchasing of furniture is the "greenest" way of furnishing a home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sierraclub.typepad.com/greenlife/2008/09/green-your-re-1.html|title=Green Your Rental - Eco Furnishings - The Green Life|date=2008-09-30|publisher=Sierraclub.typepad.com|accessdate=2012-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Vintage guitar]]s also became increasingly desired objects among musicians and collectors during the nineties and afterwards.  Some music stores specialize in selling used musical instruments, used copies of printed music, and related paraphernalia.

'''Youth''' is the time of life when one is young, and often means the time between [[childhood]] and [[adult]]hood ([[Maturity (psychological)|maturity]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/youth "Youth"].

Youth is an experience that may shape an individual's level of dependency, which can be marked in various ways according to different cultural perspectives. Personal experience is marked by an individual's cultural norms or traditions, while a youth's level of dependency means the extent to which he still relies on his family emotionally and economically.&lt;ref name=Furlong1/&gt;

=== General ===
Around the world, the [[English language|English]] terms ''youth'', ''[[Adolescence|adolescent]]'', ''teenager'', ''kid'', and ''young person'' are interchanged, often meaning the same thing,&lt;ref&gt;Konopka, Gisela. (1973) [http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ087128 "Requirements for Healthy Development of Adolescent Youth"], ''Adolescence''. '''8''' (31), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; but they are occasionally differentiated. ''Youth'' can be referred to as the time of life when one is young. This involves childhood, and the time of life which is neither childhood nor adulthood, but rather somewhere in between.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/youth|title=Youth dictionary definition – youth defined|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Youth'' also identifies a particular mindset of attitude, as in "He is very ''youth''ful". For certain uses, such as employment statistics, the term also sometimes refers to individuals from the ages of 14 to 21.&lt;ref&gt;Altschuler, D.; Strangler, G.; Berkley, K.; Burton, L. (2009); [http://cjjr.georgetown.edu/pdfs/TransitionPaperFinal.pdf "Supporting Youth in Transition to Adulthood: Lessons Learned from Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916235341/http://cjjr.georgetown.edu/pdfs/TransitionPaperFinal.pdf |date=September 16, 2012 }}. Center for Juvenile Justice Reform.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term ''adolescence'' refers to a specific age range during a specific developmental period in a person's life, unlike youth which is a socially constructed category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Youth Studies, An Introduction|last = Furlong|first = Andy|publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Milton Park, Abingdon|pages = 2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] defines ''youth'' as persons between the ages of 15 and 24 with all UN statistics based on this range, the UN states education as a source for these statistics. The [[UN]] also recognizes that this varies without prejudice to other age groups listed by member states such as 18–30. A useful distinction within the UN itself can be made between teenagers (i.e. those between the ages of 13 and 19) and young adults (those between the ages of 18 and 32). While seeking to impose some uniformity on statistical approaches, the UN itself is aware of contradictions between approaches in its own statutes. Hence under the 15–24 definition (introduced in 1981) children are defined as those under the age of 14 while under the 1979 Convention on the [[Rights of the Child]], those under the age of 18 are regarded as children.&lt;ref name=Furlong2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=Andy|title=Youth Studies: An Introduction|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=USA|isbn=978-0-415-56476-2|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN also states they are aware that several definitions exist for [https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/documents/youth/fact-sheets/youth-definition.pdf youth within UN entities] such as [http://unhabitat.org/ Youth Habitat 15–32] and African Youth Charter 15–35.

Although linked to biological processes of development and aging, ''youth'' is also defined as a [[social position]] that reflects the meanings different cultures and societies give to individuals between childhood and adulthood. The term in itself when referred to in a manner of social position, can be ambiguous when applied to someone of an older age with very low social position; potentially when still dependent on their guardians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Youth Studies: An Introduction|last = Furlong|first = Andy|publisher = Routledge|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0415564793|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars argue that age-based definitions have not been consistent across cultures or times and that thus it is more accurate to focus on social processes in the transition to adult independence for defining youth.&lt;ref name="Tyyska"&gt;{{cite book|title=Contemporary Youth Research: Local Expressions and Global Connections|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gXuqQ_hueXQC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;ots=17-MF_s9yw&amp;dq=Conceptualizing%20and%20theorizing%20youth%3A%20Global%20perspectives&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=0-7546-4161-9|publisher=Ashgate Books|location=London|year=2005|author=Tyyskä, Vappu|chapter=Conceptualizing and Theorizing Youth: Global Perspectives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"This world demands the qualities of youth: not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the life of ease." – Robert Kennedy&lt;ref&gt;[http://rfkcenter.org/lifevision/dayofaffirmation/ "Day of Affirmation, University of Cape Town, South Africa.

Youth is the stage of constructing the [[self-concept]]. The self-concept of youth is influenced by variables such as peers, lifestyle, gender, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, A. (2003) "Psychology of Adolescents", ''Self-Concept, Weight Issues and Body Image in Children and Adolescents'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a time of a person's life when their choices are most likely to affect their future.&lt;ref&gt;Wing, John, Jr. "Youth."

=== Other definitions ===

In much of sub-Saharan Africa, the term "youth" is associated with young men from 15 to 30 or 35 years of age. [[Youth in Nigeria]] includes all members of the Federal Republic of Nigeria aged 18–35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nigeria 2009 National Youth Policy|url=https://www.k4health.org/toolkits/youthpolicy/nigeria-national-youth-policy-and-strategic-plan-action}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many African girls experience youth as a brief interlude between the onset of [[puberty]] and [[marriage]] and [[motherhood]]. But in urban settings, poor women are often considered youth much longer, even if they bear children outside of marriage. Varying culturally, the gender constructions of youth in Latin America and Southeast Asia differ from those of sub-Saharan Africa. In Vietnam, widespread notions of youth are sociopolitical constructions for both sexes between the ages of 15 and 35.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Dalsgaard, Anne Line Hansen, Karen Tranberg. "Youth and the City in the Global South" In Tracking Globalization. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. 2008: 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]], the term ''youth'' refers to people of both sexes from 15 to 29 years old. This age bracket reflects the influence on Brazilian law of international organizations like the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO). It is also shaped by the notion of adolescence that has entered everyday life in Brazil through a discourse on children's rights.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The intergovernmental organization [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] defines ''youth'' as "those between 15 and 29 years of age".&lt;ref&gt;.OECD.org.[http://www.oecd.org/youth.htm ''OECD work on Youth''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;.OECD Family Database [https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/CO_3_5_Young_people_not_in_education_or_employment.pdf ''Young people not in education or employment''].&lt;/ref&gt;

August 12 was declared [[International Youth Day]] by the United Nations.

==Youth rights==
{{Main article|Youth rights}}
{{Youth rights sidebar}}
[[Children's rights]] cover all the rights that belong to children. When they grow up they are granted with new rights (like voting, consent, driving, etc.) and duties (criminal response, etc.). There are different [[minimum]] limits of age at which youth are not free, independent or legally competent to take some decisions or actions. Some of these limits are [[voting age]], [[age of candidacy]], [[age of consent]], [[age of majority]], [[age of criminal responsibility]], [[drinking age]], [[driving age]], etc. After youth reach these limits they are free to vote, have sexual intercourse, buy or consume alcohol beverages or drive [[cars]], etc.

===Voting age===
{{Main article|Voting age}}
[[Voting age]] is the [[minimum age]] established by law that a person must attain to be eligible to [[Suffrage|vote in a public election]]. Typically, the age is set at 18 years; however, ages as low as 16 and as high as 21 exist (see list below). Studies show that 21% of all 18 year olds have experience with voting. This is an important right since, by voting they can support politics selected by themselves and not only by people of older generations.

===Age of candidacy===
{{Main article|Age of candidacy}}
'''Age of candidacy''' is the minimum age at which a person can legally qualify to hold certain elected government offices. In many cases, it also determines the age at which a person may be [[nomination rules|eligible to stand]] for an election or be granted [[ballot access]].

===Age of consent===
{{Main article|Age of consent}}
The [[age of consent]] is the age at which a person is considered [[legally competent]] to consent to [[Human sexual activity|sexual acts]], and is thus the minimum age of a person with whom another person is legally permitted to engage in sexual activity. The distinguishing aspect of the age of consent laws is that the person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim, and their sex partner as the offender.

=== Defense of infancy ===
{{Main article|Defense of infancy}}
The [[defense of infancy]] is a form of [[defense (legal)|defense]] known as an [[excuse]] so that [[defendant]]s falling within the definition of an "[[infant]]" are excluded from [[crime|criminal]] [[legal liability|liability]] for their [[action (philosophy)|action]]s, if at the relevant time, they had not reached an '''age of criminal responsibility'''. This implies that children lack the judgment that comes with age and experience to be held criminally responsible. After reaching the initial age, there may be levels of responsibility dictated by age and the type of offense committed.

=== Drinking age ===
{{Main article|Drinking age}}
The [[Drinking age|legal drinking age]] is the age at which a person can consume or purchase [[alcoholic beverage]]s. These laws cover a wide range of issues and behaviors, addressing when and where alcohol can be consumed. The minimum age alcohol can be legally consumed can be different from the age when it can be purchased in some countries. These laws vary among different countries and many laws have exemptions or special circumstances. Most laws apply only to drinking alcohol in public places, with alcohol consumption in the home being mostly unregulated (an exception being the UK, which has a minimum legal age of five for supervised consumption in private places).  Some countries also have different age limits for different types of alcoholic drinks.&lt;ref name="Icap Reports 4"&gt;[http://www.icap.org/portals/0/download/all_pdfs/icap_reports_english/report4.pdf Drinking Age Limits] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120062253/http://www.icap.org/portals/0/download/all_pdfs/icap_reports_english/report4.pdf |date=2013-01-20 }} – International Center for Alcohol Policies&lt;/ref&gt;

===Driving age===
{{Main article|Driving age}}
[[Driving age]] is the age at which a person can apply for a [[driver's license]]. Countries with the lowest driving ages (below 17) are Australia, Canada, El Salvador, Iceland, Israel, Estonia, Macedonia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Sweden, the United Kingdom (Mainland) and United States. The Canadian province of Alberta and several U.S. states permit youth driving as low as 14. [[Niger]] has the highest minimum driving age in the world at 23. In India, driving is legal after getting a license at the age of 18.

===Legal working age===
{{Main article|Legal working age}}
{{See also|Right to work}}
The '''legal working age''' is the minimum age required by [[law]] for a person to work, in each [[country]] or [[jurisdiction]]. The threshold of adulthood, or  "the [[age of majority]]" as recognized or declared in law in most countries has been set at age 18.  Some types of labor are commonly prohibited even for those above the working age, if they have not reached yet the [[age of majority]]. Activities that are dangerous, [[harmful]] to the [[health]] or that may affect the [[morals]] of [[Minor (law)|minors]] fall into this category.

===Student rights in higher education===
{{Main article|Student rights in higher education}}
[[Student rights]] are those [[rights]], such as civil, constitutional, contractual and consumer rights, which regulate student rights and freedoms and allow [[student]]s to make use of their educational investment. These include such things as the right to free speech and association, to due process, equality, autonomy, safety and privacy, and accountability in contracts and advertising, which regulate the treatment of students by teachers and administrators.

=== Smoking age ===
{{Main article|Smoking age}}
The smoking age is the minimum age a person can buy tobacco, and/or smoke in public. Most countries regulate this law at the national level while at some it is done by the state or province.

==Socioeconomic issues==
The growth of [[youth unemployment]], which reached new heights of 22.5% across the European Union, as well as the precarisation of labor market conditions reveals that the gap between labor market 'outsiders' and 'insiders' is widening. One of the most dramatic possible consequences of this growing divergence could arguably be the disenfranchisement of labour market outsiders, especially young people, from social and political participation (Ferragina et al. 2016).&lt;ref&gt; Emanuele Ferragina et al.(2016). ''Outsiderness and participation in liberal market economies.'' PACO The Open Journal of Sociopolitical Studies, 9, 986–1014  https://scholar.google.fr/scholar_url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsiba-ese.unisalento.it%2Findex.php%2Fpaco%2Farticle%2Fdownload%2F16664%2F14327&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=T&amp;ei=AN-iWPD-EIupmAHrx5vACw&amp;scisig=AAGBfm3_dOCLibWFNHNtG62FKywcq7PxNA&amp;nossl=1&amp;ws=1920x909&lt;/ref&gt; If the objective of policymakers is to revive social and political participation in a period of great disenchantment and declining legitimacy for our democracies, there is definitely scope for further enquiry and action into the effects of youth outsiderness on social and political participation.

== School and education ==
{{Main article|Schooling}}

Young people spend much of their lives in educational settings, and their experiences in schools, colleges and universities can shape much of their subsequent lives.&lt;ref name=Furlong3&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=Andy|title=Youth Studies: An Introduction|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=USA|isbn=978-0-415-56476-2|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that poverty and income affect the likelihood for the incompletion of high school. These factors also increase the likelihood for the youth to not go to a college or university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Njapa-Minyard|first=Pamela|title=After-school Programs: Attracting and Sustaining Youth Participation|journal=International Journal of Learning|year=2010|volume=17|issue=9|pages=177–182|url=http://ijl.cgpublisher.com/product/pub.30/prod.2958}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, 12.3 percent of young people ages 16 to 24 are disconnected, meaning they are neither in school nor working.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Burd-Sharps and Kristen Lewis. ''[http://www.measureofamerica.org/youth-disconnection-2017/ Promising Gains, Persistent Gaps: Youth Disconnection in America.]'' 2017. [[Measure of America]] of the Social Science Research Council. &lt;/ref&gt; 

===Health and mortality===
The leading causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and adults are due to certain health-risk behaviors. These behaviors are often established during youth and extend into adulthood. Since the risk behaviors in adulthood and youth are interrelated, problems in adulthood are preventable by influencing youth behavior.

A 2004 [[Death|mortality]] study of youth (defined in this study as ages 10–24) mortality worldwide found that 97% of deaths occurred in low to middle-income countries, with the majority in southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Maternal conditions accounted for 15% of female deaths, while [[HIV/AIDS]] and [[tuberculosis]] were responsible for 11% of [[death]]s; 14% of male and 5% of female deaths were attributed to traffic accidents, the largest cause overall. Violence accounted for 12% of male deaths. [[Suicide]] was the cause of 6% of all deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Global patterns of mortality in young people: a systematic analysis of population health data|journal=The Lancet|date=September 2009|volume=374|issue=9693|pages=881–892|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60741-8|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2809%2960741-8/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] developed its Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) in 2003 to help assess risk behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/yrbs/brief.htm|title=This page has been redirected|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; YRBSS monitors six categories of priority health-risk behaviors among youth and young adults. These are behaviors that contribute to unintentional [[injuries]] and [[violence]];
* [[Youth smoking|tobacco]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and other [[Substance abuse|drug use]];
* [[sexual behaviors]] that contribute to [[unintended pregnancy]] and [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]]) infection;

===Obesity===
{{main article|Childhood obesity}}
[[Obesity]] now affects one in five children in the United States, and is the most prevalent nutritional disease of children and adolescents in the United States. Although obesity-associated morbidities occur more frequently in adults, significant consequences of obesity as well as the antecedents of adult disease occur in obese children and adolescents.

Discrimination against overweight children begins early in childhood and becomes progressively institutionalized. Obese children may be taller than their non-overweight peers, in which case they are apt to be viewed as more mature. The inappropriate expectations that result may have an adverse effect on their socialization.

Many of the cardiovascular consequences that characterize adult-onset obesity are preceded by abnormalities that begin in childhood. [[Hyperlipidemia]], [[hypertension]], and abnormal [[glucose tolerance]] occur with increased frequency in obese children and adolescents. The relationship of cardiovascular risk factors to visceral fat independent of total body fat remains unclear. [[Sleep apnea]], [[pseudotumor cerebri]], and [[Blount's disease]] represent major sources of morbidity for which rapid and sustained weight reduction is essential. Although several periods of increased risk appear in childhood, it is not clear whether obesity with onset early in childhood carries a greater risk of adult morbidity and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;William, H. (1998) Health Consequences of Obesity in Youth: Childhood Predictors of Adult Disease, ''Pediatrics'', 101(2), 518–525.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bullying===
[[Bullying]] among school-aged youth is increasingly being recognized as an important problem affecting well-being and social functioning. While a certain amount of conflict and harassment is typical of youth peer relations, bullying presents a potentially more serious threat to healthy youth development. The definition of bullying is widely agreed on in literature on bullying.&lt;ref&gt;Boulton MJ, Underwood K. Bully/victim problems among middle school children.

The majority of research on bullying has been conducted in Europe and Australia.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Considerable variability among countries in the prevalence of bullying has been reported. In an international survey of adolescent health-related behaviors, the percentage of students who reported being bullied at least once during the current term ranged from a low of 15% to 20% in some countries to a high of 70% in others.&lt;ref&gt;King A, Wold B, Tudor-Smith C, Harel Y.

Washington, DC: US Dept of Education; 1999:1–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular concern is frequent bullying, typically defined as bullying that occurs once a week or more. The prevalence of frequent bullying reported internationally ranges from a low of 1.9% among one Irish sample to a high of 19% in a Malta study.&lt;ref&gt;Borg MG.

Research examining characteristics of youth involved in bullying has consistently found that both bullies and those bullied demonstrate poorer [[psychosocial]] functioning than their non-involved peers. Youth who bully others tend to demonstrate higher levels of conduct problems and dislike of school, whereas youth who are bullied generally show higher levels of [[Emotional insecurity|insecurity]], [[anxiety]], [[Depression in childhood and adolescence|depression]], [[loneliness]], [[unhappiness]], physical and mental symptoms, and low [[self-esteem]]. Males who are bullied also tend to be physically weaker than males in general. The few studies that have examined the characteristics of youth who both bully and are bullied found that these individuals exhibit the poorest psychosocial functioning overall.&lt;ref&gt;Austin S, Joseph S.

===Sexual health and politics===

====General====

[[Globalization]] and transnational flows have had tangible effects on sexual relations, identities, and subjectivities. In the wake of an increasingly globalized world order under waning Western dominance, within ideologies of modernity, civilization, and programs for social improvement, discourses on [[Human population control|population control]], '[[safe sex]]', and '[[Sexual and reproductive health and rights|sexual rights]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Petchesky, R. (2000) 'Sexual rights: inventing a concept, mapping an international practice,' in R. Parker, R.M. Barbosa and P. Aggleton (eds), ''Framing the sexual subject: The politics of Gender, Sexuality and Power'', Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 81–103&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sex education]] programmes grounded in evidence-based approaches are a cornerstone in reducing adolescent sexual risk behaviours and promoting sexual health. In addition to providing accurate information about consequences of [[Sexually transmitted disease]] or STIs and early pregnancy, such programmes build life skills for interpersonal communication and decision making. Such programmes are most commonly implemented in schools, which reach large numbers of teenagers in areas where school enrollment rates are high. However, since not all young people are in school, sex education programmes have also been implemented in clinics, juvenile detention centers and youth-oriented community agencies. Notably, some programmes have been found to reduce risky sexual behaviours when implemented in both school and community settings with only minor modifications to the curricula.&lt;ref&gt;Bearinger, Linda H., et al. 2007. "Global perspectives on the sexual and reproductive health of adelescents: patterns, prevention, and potential." ''The Lancet 369.9568: 1226''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Philippines ====
The [[Sangguniang Kabataan]] ("Youth Council" in [[English language|English]]), commonly known as SK, was a youth council in each [[barangay]] (village or district) in the [[Philippines]], before being put "on hold", but not quite abolished, prior to the [[Philippine barangay elections, 2013|2013 barangay elections]].&lt;ref name=SunStarMar14&gt;{{cite news|last=Catajan|first=Maria Elena|title=NYC: Use SK funds right|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/baguio/local-news/2014/03/24/nyc-use-sk-funds-right-334774|accessdate=26 March 2014|newspaper=SunStar Baguio|date=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The council represented teenagers from 15 to 17 years old who have resided in their barangay for at least six months and registered to vote. It was the local youth legislature in the village and therefore led the local youth program and projects of the government. The Sangguniang Kabataan was an offshoot of the KB or the ''Kabataang Barangay'' (Village Youth) which was abolished when the [[Local Government Code]] of 1991 was enacted.

==In the Global South==

The vast majority of young people live in [[Developing country|developing countries]]: according to the UN, globally around 85 per cent of 15- to 25-year-olds live in developing countries, a figure projected to grow 89.5 per cent by 2025. Moreover, this majority are extremely diverse: some live in rural areas but many inhabit the overcrowded metropolises of [[India]], [[Youth in Mongolia|Mongolia]] and other parts of Asia and in South America, some live traditional lives in [[tribal societies]], while others participate in global youth culture in [[ghetto]] contexts.&lt;ref name=Furlong4&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=Andy|title=Youth Studies: An Introduction|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=USA|isbn=978-0-415-56476-2|pages=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many young lives in developing countries are defined by poverty, some suffer from famine and a lack of clean water, while involvement in armed conflict is all common. Health problems are rife, especially due to the prevalence of [[HIV/AIDS]] in certain regions. The [[United Nations]] estimates that 200 million young people live in poverty, 130 million are illiterate and 10 million live with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=Furlong4/&gt;
