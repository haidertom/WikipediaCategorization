      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3924">'''AIDS fatigue''' is a phenomenon wherein individuals or societies who had been concerned about the impact of [[HIV]] or [[AIDS]] become [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitized]] to the having a strong emotional response to HIV issues after receiving continual messages about the danger over a long period of time.

==Causes==
[[Anthony Fauci]], director of the United States' [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) said that one of the causes of AIDS fatigue are huge successes in treatment which subsequently have made some people perceive the disease as less concerning.  Fauci noted that whereas in the 1980s in America "we had 30-40 percent of the hospital wards in inner-city hospitals occupied by people with advanced HIV disease, now because of the success of the therapies - which is great news - we don't have that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2007-11-30/health/aids.day.fauci_1_hiv-and-aids-new-infections-world-aids-day?_s=PM:HEALTH |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707200846/http://articles.cnn.com/2007-11-30/health/aids.day.fauci_1_hiv-and-aids-new-infections-world-aids-day?_s=PM:HEALTH |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 July 2012 |title=Fauci: Despite 'AIDS fatigue,' Americans should care |author=[[Anthony Fauci]] |work=cnn.com |date=30 November 2007 |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Some of the consequences of AIDS fatigue include the following:&lt;ref name="endofstory"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mg.co.za/article/2003-11-27-end-of-the-aids-story |title=End of the Aids story? |first=Guy |last=Berger |work=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]] |date=27 November 2003 |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

The increase may also be because of new treatments.&lt;ref name=HIVrising /&gt;

{{Advanced Placement}}

The '''Advanced Placement Psychology''' ('''AP Psychology''', '''AP Psych''', or '''APPSY''') course and corresponding exam are part of [[College Board|College Board's]] [[Advanced Placement Program]]. This  course is tailored for students interested in the field of [[psychology]] and as an opportunity to earn Advanced Placement credit or exemption from a [[college]]-level psychology course.  It was the shortest AP exam until the [[AP Physics C]] exam was split into two separate exams in 2006.

==Topics covered==
The College Board provides a course of study to help educators prepare their students for the AP Psychology exam. The exam covers the following 14 areas. The percentage indicates the portion of the multiple-choice section of the exam focused on each content area:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP: Psychology|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/psych/topics.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exam==
[[Image:AP Psych Test.JPG|thumb|left|Free response section booklet]]
The exam includes two sections: a 70-minute [[multiple choice]] section (100 questions) and a 50-minute [[free response]] section (2 prompts). The multiple choice provides two-thirds of the grade and the free-response provides the remaining third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP: Psychology|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/psych/exam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the May 2011 AP Exam administration, total scores on the multiple-choice section are based only on the number of questions answered correctly. Points are no longer deducted for incorrect answers. Grading (the number of points needed to get a certain score) is slightly more strict as a result.

==Grade distribution==

The exam was first held in 1992. Grade distributions for the Psychology exam scores since 2010 were:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24725">[[File:New afforestation looking into Rand Wood - geograph.org.uk - 329908.jpg|thumb|300px|right|An afforestation project in Rand Wood, [[Lincolnshire]], [[England]]]]

'''Afforestation''' is the establishment of a forest or stand of trees ([[forestation]]) in an area where there was no previous tree cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionaryofforestry.org/dict/term/afforestation |title=SAFnet Dictionary &amp;#124; Definition For [afforestation&amp;#93; |publisher=Dictionaryofforestry.org |date=2008-10-23 |accessdate=2012-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314232003/http://dictionaryofforestry.org/dict/term/afforestation |archivedate=2012-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many government and non-governmental organizations directly engage in programs of afforestation to create forests, increase [[carbon capture]] and [[carbon sequestration]], and help to anthropogenically improve [[biodiversity]]. In the UK, afforestation may mean converting the legal status of some land to [[royal forest]].

==Processes==
{{see|Gap dynamics}}
Gap dynamics is the pattern of plant growth that occurs following the creation of a forest gap, a local area of natural disturbance that results in an opening in the canopy of a forest. Gap dynamics are a typical characteristic of temperate and tropical forests, and have a wide variety of causes and effects on forest life.

Sometimes special tools, such as a [[tree planting bar]], are used to make planting of trees easier and faster.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==In areas of degraded soil==
In some places, forests need help to reestablish themselves because of [[natural environment|environmental]] factors.  For a example, in arid zones, once [[forest cover]] is destroyed, the land may become dry and inhospitable for the growth of new trees .  Other factors include [[overgrazing]] by [[livestock]], especially animals such as [[goat]]s, [[cow]]s, and [[over-harvesting]] of forest resources. Together these may lead to [[desertification]] and the loss of [[topsoil]]; without soil, forests cannot grow until the long process of soil creation has been completed - if [[erosion]] allows this. In some tropical areas, forest cover removal may result in a [[duricrust]] or [[duripan]] that effectively seal off the soil to water penetration and root growth.  In many areas, reforestation is impossible because people are using the land. In other areas, mechanical breaking up of duripans or duricrusts is necessary, careful and continued watering may be essential, and special protection, such as fencing, may be needed.

== Forests to attract rain ==
Several new studies suggest that forests attract rain and this may explain why drought is occurring more frequently in parts of the world such as western Africa. A new study by Carol Rasmussen,
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory gives the first observational evidence that the southern Amazon rain forest triggers its own rainy season using water vapor from plant leaves. The finding helps explain why deforestation in this region is linked with reduced rainfall &lt;ref&gt;Carol Rasmussen (2017), New study shows the Amazon makes its own rainy season, 
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
 https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2608/new-study-shows-the-amazon-makes-its-own-rainy-season/&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Douglas Sheil and Daniel Murdiyarso hypothesis suggests that forest cover plays a much greater role in determining rainfall than previously recognized. It explains how forested regions generate large-scale flows in atmospheric water vapor&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Sheil Daniel Murdiyarso
BioScience, Volume 59, Issue 4, 1 April 2009, Pages 341–347,https://doi.org/10.1525/bio.2009.59.4.12&lt;/ref&gt; Makarieva and Gorshkov have developed a hypothesis to explain how forests attract moist air and increase rainfall in area covered by trees &lt;ref&gt;Makarieva AM, Gorshkov VG, 2007, [[Biotic pump]] of atmospheric moisture as driver of the hydrological cycle on land, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 11: 1013–1033&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries and regions==
===Australia===
In [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] (a city of 1.3 million as of June 2016),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/3218.0Media%20Release12016?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=3218.0&amp;issue=2016&amp;num=&amp;view=|title=Ten years of growth: Australia's population hot spots|publisher=Australian Bureau|accessdate=29 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930073403/http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/3218.0Media%20Release12016?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=3218.0&amp;issue=2016&amp;num=&amp;view=|archive-date=2017-09-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premier [[Mike Rann]] (2002 to 2011) launched an urban forest initiative in 2003 to plant 3 million native trees and shrubs by 2014 on 300 project sites across the metro area.  The projects range from large habitat restoration projects to local biodiversity projects. Thousands of Adelaide citizens have participated in community planting days. Sites include parks, reserves, transport corridors, schools, water courses and coastline. Only trees native to the local area are planted to ensure genetic integrity. Premier Rann said the project aimed to beautify and cool the city and make it more liveable; improve air and water quality and reduce Adelaide's greenhouse gas emissions by 600,000 tonnes of C02 a year. He said it was also about creating and conserving habitat for wildlife and preventing species loss.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.milliontrees.com.au {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924184135/http://www.milliontrees.com.au/ |date=2014-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
There is extensive and ongoing [[Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest|Amazon deforestation]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;[[E. O. Wilson]], 2002&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}}). There is also ongoing afforestation effort in Brazil. In an afforestation hotspot outlined in Para, Brazil, 1 billion trees are intended to be planted to restore deforested lands by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Afforestation in Para, Brazil|url=http://lcluc.umd.edu/hotspot/afforestation-para-brazil-0|website=NASA Land-Cover/Land-Use Change Program|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burkina Faso===
Desertification is increasing along the [[Sahel]], the strip of land between Africa's fertile tropics and the [[Sahara Desert]]. After a crippling famine in the 1970s caused by overgrazing and deforestation, a local community approach has been pioneered by Yacouba Sawadogo, a peasant farmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 1080 Films - The Man Who Stopped The Desert|url = http://www.1080films.co.uk/Yacoubamovie/synopsis.htm|website = www.1080films.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-05-04|first = Paula|last = Wildash}}&lt;/ref&gt; By replanting trees and crops together in holes filled with compost, whole villages have been able to move back to areas considered uninhabitable.

===China===
[[File:Jiayu County - Panjiawan - on the Yangtze embankment - P1540267.JPG|thumb|Strips of forest are planted along hundreds of kilometers of the [[Yangtze]] [[levee]]s in [[Hubei]] province&lt;ref&gt;[http://slt.hubei.gov.cn/dfj/info.aspx?ArtID=2797 省河道堤防建设管理局2016年工作要点] (The work goals of the provincial waterway flood protection levee administration for 2016), 2016-02-17&lt;/ref&gt;]]
China has deforested most of its historically wooded areas. China reached the point where timber yields declined far below historic levels, due to over-harvesting of trees beyond [[sustainable]] yield.&lt;ref&gt;G.A.McBeath, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Although it has set official goals for reforestation, these goals are set over an 80-year time horizon and have not been significantly met by 2008. China is trying to correct these problems by projects like the [[Green Wall of China]], which aims to replant a great deal of forests and halt the expansion of the [[Gobi desert]]. The Green Wall of China Project has historical precedences dating back to before the Common Era. However, in pre-modern periods, government sponsored afforestation projects along the historical frontier regions were mostly for military fortification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Yuan Julian|date=2018|title=FRONTIER, FORTIFICATION, AND FORESTATION: DEFENSIVE WOODLAND ON THE SONG–LIAO BORDER IN THE LONG ELEVENTH CENTURY|url=https://www.academia.edu/37471839/_Frontier_Fortification_and_Forestation_Defensive_Woodland_on_the_Song-Liao_Border_in_the_Long_Eleventh_Century_Journal_of_Chinese_History_2.2_2018_313-334|journal=Journal of Chinese History|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|pages=313–334|doi=10.1017/jch.2018.7|issn=2059-1632|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A law promulgated in 1981 requires that every school student over the age of 11 plants at least one tree per year. As a result, China has the highest afforestation rate of any country or region in the world, with 47,000 square kilometers of afforestation in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-01/09/content_10631987.htm |title=China to plant more trees in 2009_English_Xinhua |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2009-01-09 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the forest area per capita is still far lower than the international average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90776/90882/6371092.html |title=51.54 billion trees planted by ordinary Chinese in 27 years - People's Daily Online |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date=2008-03-11 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been considerable criticism regarding the effectiveness of planting so many trees especially in regions where they never grew prior. Studies reveal that the water table of those areas is becoming deeper indicating significant water loss.

===Europe===
Europe has deforested the majority of its historical forests. The [[European Union]] (EU) has paid farmers for afforestation since 1990, offering grants to turn [[Agricultural land|farmland]] back into forest and payments for the management of forest. Between 1993 and 1997, EU afforestation policies made possible the re-forestation of over 5,000 square kilometres of land. A second program, running between 2000 and 2006, afforested more than 1000 square kilometres of land (precise statistics not yet available). A third such program began in 2007. Europe's forests are growing by 0.8 million ha a year thanks to these programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = European Wood_Forest growth|url = http://www.europeanwood.org.cn/en/forest-growth|website = www.europeanwood.org.cn|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Poland]], the National Program of Afforestation was introduced by the government after [[World War II]], when  area of forests shrank to 20% of country's territory. Consequently, forested areas of Poland grew year by year, and on December 31, 2006, forests covered 29% of the country (see: [[Polish forests]]). It is planned that by 2050, forests will cover 33% of Poland.

According to [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] statistics, [[Spain]] had the third fastest afforestation rate in Europe in the 1990-2005 period, after Iceland and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blatantworld.com/feature/the_world/most_re_forested_countries.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709051455/http://www.blatantworld.com/feature/the_world/most_re_forested_countries.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-07-09 |title=FAO Data |publisher=Blatantworld.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/spain.html |title=Mongabay.com: Deforestation tables and charts for Spain |publisher=Rainforests.mongabay.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those years, a total of 44,360 square kilometers were afforested, and the total forest cover rose from 13,5 to 17,9 million hectares. In 1990, forests covered 26.6% of the Spanish territory. As of 2007, that figure had risen to 36.6%. Spain today has the fifth largest forest area in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/forestarea.htm |title=United Nations Statistics Division - Environment Statistics |publisher=Unstats.un.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013 the [[UK government]] set a target of 12% woodland cover in [[England]] by 2060, up from the then 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government Forestry and Woodlands|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/181809/pb13871-forestry-policy-statement.pdf.pdf|publisher=Defra|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Government-backed initiatives such as the [[Woodland Carbon Code]] are intended to support this objective by encouraging corporations and landowners to create new woodland to offset their carbon emissions.

Alpine and Subalpine regions have undergone a lot of deforestation and then forestation in the last 300 years. Out of this has emerged much practical experience. One example is the clustered group,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waldwissen.net/waldwirtschaft/waldbau/bergwald/wsl_rottenaufforstung/index_DE&lt;/ref&gt; which is a method to bring in stable age mixed tree communities.

===Hong Kong===
Since the founding of the crown colony in the 19th century, afforestation has taken place to prevent soil erosion in the catchment areas of the [[list of reservoirs in Hong Kong|reservoir]]s that were built. During the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong|Japanese occupation]] in the Second World War, the countryside was deforested as the remaining population required fuel to survive. Most of the trees were cut down and extensive reafforestation was carried out after the war. Trees that were planted are mostly non-native species, such as: [[Pinus massoniana]], [[Acacia confusa]] (Formosan acacia), [[Lophostemon confertus]] and the [[Melaleuca quinquenervia|Paper Bark Tree]].

===India===
[[File:Marebilli forest.jpg|thumb|Afforestation in South India]]
India has witnessed a minor increase in the percentage of the land area under forest cover from 1950 to 2006. In 1950 around 40.48 million hectares was covered by forest. In 1980 it increased to 67.47 million hectares and in 2006 it was found to be 69 million hectares. 23% of India is covered by forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = India: Environmental Profile|url = http://rainforests.mongabay.com/20india.htm|website = rainforests.mongabay.com|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forests of India are grouped into 5 major categories and 16 types based on biophysical criteria. 38% of the forest is categorized as subtropical dry deciduous and 30% as tropical moist deciduous and other smaller groups. Only local species are planted in an area. Trees bearing fruits are preferred wherever possible due to their function as a food source.

===Iran===
Iran is considered a low forest cover region of the world with present cover approximating seven percent of the land area. This is a value reduced by an estimated six million hectares of virgin forest, which includes [[oak]], [[almond]] and [[pistachio]].&lt;ref name="Stanturf"&gt;J.A.Stanturf, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to soil substrates, it is difficult to achieve afforestation on a large scale compared to other temperate areas endowed with more fertile and less rocky and arid soil conditions.&lt;ref name="Stanturf"/&gt;  Consequently, most of the afforestation is conducted with non-native species,&lt;ref name="Stanturf"/&gt; leading to [[habitat destruction]] for native [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and resulting in an accelerated [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}}

Since 1996, with the preparation and testing of areas suitable for afforestation in the highlands of northern Tehran, the plan of flooding began with the name of the Southern Alborz Range forestry plan, which will cover approximately 2700 hectares of afforestation by 2017.By 2020, more than 2000 hectares will be added to the plan.(Amiri)

===Israel===

{{main|Jewish National Fund#Afforestation}}
Tree-planting is an ancient [[Jewish]] tradition, mentioned in the [[Talmud]] as being more important than greeting the [[Messiah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =President of German States Council of Education Ministers Plants Tree at Kennedy Memorial | newspaper =Jerusalem Post | department =JPost.com: Green Israel: People And The Environment | publisher =The Jerusalem Post | date =July 29, 2009 | url =http://www.jpost.com/Green-Israel/People-and-The-Environment/President-of-German-States-Council-of-Education-Ministers-Plants-Tree-at-Kennedy-Memorial | accessdate = December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With over 240 million planted trees, [[Israel]] is one of only two countries that entered the 21st century with a net gain in the number of trees, due to massive afforestation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel Forestry &amp; Ecology|url=http://www.jnf.org/work-we-do/our-projects/forestry-ecology/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207064210/http://www.jnf.org/work-we-do/our-projects/forestry-ecology/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=7 February 2009|publisher=[[Jewish National Fund]]|accessdate=29 October 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt; Most Israeli forests are the product of a major afforestation campaign by the [[Jewish National Fund]] (JNF).{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Critics argue that many JNF lands inside the West Bank were illegally confiscated from Palestinian refugees, and that the JNF furthermore should not be involved with lands in the West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Leon."The Jewish National Fund: How the Land Was ‘Redeemed’: The JNF's historical concept of exclusively Jewish land is wholly anachronistic"; Palestine-Israel Journal, Vol 12 No. 4 &amp; Vol 13 No. 1, 05/06&lt;/ref&gt; Shaul Ephraim Cohen has claimed that trees have been planted to restrict Bedouin herding.&lt;ref&gt;Shaul Ephraim Cohen. "The Politics of Planting"; University of Chicago 1993 p.121&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Nathan wrote that forests were planted on the site of abandoned Arab villages after the 1948 war.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan, Susan (2005). The Other Side of Israel: My Journey Across the Jewish/Arab Divide. New York: Nan A. Talese. pp. 130–131. {{ISBN|978-0-385-51456-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, the JNF has provided the Palestinian Authority with 3,000 tree seedlings for a forested area being developed on the edge of the new city of [[Rawabi]], north of Ramallah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gross |first=Tom |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704107104574571491401847518 |title=Building Peace Without Obama's Interference |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2009-12-02 |accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Africa===
In North Africa, the [[Sahara Forest Project]] coupled with the [[Seawater greenhouse]] has been proposed. Some projects have also been launched in countries as [[Senegal]] to revert desertification. As of 2010, African leaders are discussing the combining of national resources to increase effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afriqueavenir.org/en/2010/06/17/african-leaders-discuss-great-green-wall-project-in-chadian-capital/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718235403/http://www.afriqueavenir.org/en/2010/06/17/african-leaders-discuss-great-green-wall-project-in-chadian-capital/ |archivedate=2010-07-18 |title=Combining of green walls |publisher=Afriqueavenir.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, other projects as the [[Keita Integrated Development Project|Keita Project]] in Niger have been launched in the past, and have been able to locally revert damage done by [[desertification]]. See [[Development aid#Effectiveness]]

===United States===
The United States is roughly one-third covered in forest and woodland.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Nevertheless, areas in the US were subject to significant tree planting. In the 1800s people moving westward encountered the Great Plains – land with fertile soil, a growing population and a demand for timber but with few trees to supply it. So tree planting was encouraged along homesteads. [[Arbor Day]] was founded in 1872 by [[Julius Sterling Morton]] in Nebraska City, Nebraska. By the 1930s the [[Dust Bowl]] environmental disaster signified a reason for significant new tree cover. Public works programs under the New Deal saw the planting of 18,000 miles of [[windbreak]]s stretching from North Dakota to Texas to fight soil erosion (see [[Great Plains Shelterbelt]]).

At their summit in Copenhagen in 2009, organised by the UK based The Climate Group, leaders of subnational governments – states, regions and provinces – unanimously supported a recommendation by Premier Rann to plant one billion trees across their varied jurisdictions.  The initiative was strongly supported by leaders present including Quebec Premier [[Jean Charest]], California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and Scottish First Minister [[Alex Salmond]].  At a subsequent meeting in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012, The Climate Group announced that it had already received commitments by member governments to plant more than 500 million trees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theclimategroup.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The use of afforestation as strategy of conservation of forest biomes is seen as a menace to the conservation of natural [[grassland]] and [[savanna]] biomes, as the ideal would be the [[reforestation]] of areas where forest occurs naturally.&lt;ref&gt;Veldman, J.W., Overbeck, G.E., Negreiros, D., Mahy, G., Le Stradic, S., Durigan, G., Buisson, E., Putz, F.E. &amp; Bond, W.J. (2015). Tyranny of trees in grass land ''Science'', 347, 484–485. [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6221/484.3 link].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:American Academy of Religion (logo).png|thumb]]
The '''American Academy of Religion''' ('''AAR''') is the world's largest association of [[scholar]]s in the [[List of academic disciplines|field]] of [[religious studies]] and related topics.  It is a nonprofit member association, 
serving as a professional and learned society for scholars involved in the academic study of religion. It has some 10,000 members worldwide, with the largest concentration being in the United States and Canada. AAR members are university and college professors, independent scholars, secondary teachers, clergy, seminarians, students, and interested lay-people.

== History ==

AAR was founded in 1909 as the Association of Biblical Instructors in American Colleges and Secondary Schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gearon|first1=Liam|title=MasterClass in Religious Education: Transforming Teaching and Learning|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|location=London / New York|isbn=9781441160065|page=40|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/825398792|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was changed to National Association of Biblical Instructors (NABI) in 1933. The American Academy of Religion was adopted as the organization name in 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Elizabeth|title=Founding the Fathers|date=2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-4319-2|page=8|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/794700594|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reflect its broader, inclusive mission to foster the academic study of all religions.&lt;ref&gt;

Presidents of the AAR have included well-known scholars such as [[Judith Plaskow]], [[Mark Juergensmeyer]], [[Wendy Doniger]], [[Emilie Townes]], [[Peter J. Paris]], [[Rebecca Chopp]], and [[Elizabeth A. Clark]].

== Publications ==

[[Oxford University Press]] publishes ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'' on behalf of the AAR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://jaar.oxfordjournals.org
 |title=Journal of the American Academy of Religion
 |work=Oxford University Press Journals website
 |accessdate=2011-04-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Religious Studies News'' is the quarterly newspaper of record for the organization; it transitioned from a print to online-only publication in 2010. AAR published the online book review Reading Religion. AAR publishes five book series through Oxford University Press: Academy; Reflection and Theory in the Study of Religion; Religion, Culture, and Theory; Religion in Translation; and Teaching Religious Studies. AAR presents awards each year to notable books in the study of religion. It offers three categories of Awards for Excellence: Analytical-Descriptive Studies, Historical Studies, and Constructive-Reflective Studies.

== Annual meeting ==

AAR hosts an Annual Meeting each year in November. The AAR Annual Meeting is the world's largest meeting for religious studies scholars. Over 400 events, including meetings, receptions, and academic sessions, occur on the AAR program alone; hundreds more, hosted by affiliated societies and institutions, occur over the course of the meeting. Some 10,000 people attend the AAR Annual Meeting; the location of the meeting changes each year. The AAR Annual Meeting program is developed entirely by volunteers involved in program units representing disciplines and sub-disciplines within the field.

== Other activities ==

AAR offers activities on a regional level for its members. Professional development resources such as research grants, career services, and scholarships are some of the member benefits. AAR also advocates the importance of the critical study of religion on institutional and national levels.

'''Artificial consciousness'''&lt;ref name="gunn"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thaler | first1 = S. L. | year = 1998 | title = The emerging intelligence and its critical look at us | url = | journal = Journal of Near-Death Studies | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 21–29| doi = 10.1023/A:1022990118714 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''AC'''), also known as '''machine consciousness''' ('''MC''') or '''synthetic consciousness''' ({{harvnb|Gamez|2008}}; {{harvnb|Reggia|2013}}), is a field related to [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive robotics]]. The aim of the [[Scientific theory|theory]] of artificial consciousness is to "Define that which would have to be synthesized were consciousness to be found in an engineered artifact" {{Harv|Aleksander|1995}}.

[[Neuroscience]] hypothesizes that [[consciousness]] is generated by the interoperation of various parts of the [[brain]], called the [[neural correlates of consciousness]] or NCC, though there are challenges to that perspective. Proponents of AC believe it is possible to construct [[system]]s (e.g., [[computer]] systems) that can emulate this NCC interoperation.&lt;ref name="Graziano Consciousness and the Social Brain"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graziano|first1=Michael|title=Consciousness and the Social Brain|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199928644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial consciousness concepts are also pondered in the philosophy of [[artificial intelligence]] through [[philosophy of artificial intelligence#Can a machine have a mind, consciousness, and mental states?|questions about mind, consciousness, and mental states]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]'' includes the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] foundations of AI including the questions of consciousness http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html, Russell, Stuart J., Norvig, Peter, 2003, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|0-13-790395-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical views==
As there are many hypothesized [[Consciousness#Types of consciousness|types of consciousness]], there are many potential implementations of artificial consciousness.  In the philosophical literature, perhaps the most common taxonomy of consciousness is into "access" and "phenomenal" variants.  Access consciousness concerns those aspects of [[experience]] that can be apprehended, while phenomenal consciousness concerns those aspects of experience that seemingly cannot be apprehended, instead being characterized qualitatively in terms of “raw feels”, “what it is like” or [[qualia]] ({{harvnb|Block|1997}}).

=== Plausibility debate ===
[[Type physicalism|Type-identity theorists]] and other skeptics hold the view that consciousness can only be realized in particular physical systems because consciousness has properties that necessarily depend on physical constitution ({{harvnb|Block|1978}}; {{harvnb|Bickle|2003}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schlagel | first1 = R. H. | year = 1999 | title = Why not artificial consciousness or thought? | url = | journal = Minds and Machines | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 3–28 | doi=10.1023/a:1008374714117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Searle | first1 = J. R. | year = 1980 | title = Minds, brains, and programs | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 417–457 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00005756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article "Artificial Consciousness: Utopia or Real Possibility" Giorgio Buttazzo says that despite our current technology's ability to simulate autonomy, "Working in a fully automated mode, they [the computers] cannot exhibit creativity, emotions, or [[free will]]. A computer, like a washing machine, is a slave operated by its components."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=933500&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F2%2F20203%2F00933500 Artificial consciousness: Utopia or real possibility?] Buttazzo, Giorgio, July 2001, Computer, ISSN 0018-9162&lt;/ref&gt;

For other theorists (e.g., [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalists]]), who define mental states in terms of causal roles, any system that can instantiate the same pattern of causal roles, regardless of physical constitution, will instantiate the same mental states, including consciousness ({{harvnb|Putnam|1967}}).

==== Computational Foundation argument ====
One of the most explicit arguments for the plausibility of AC comes from [[David Chalmers]].  His proposal, found within his article {{harvnb | Chalmers | 2011}}, is roughly that the right kinds of computations are sufficient for the possession of a conscious mind. In the outline, he defends his claim thus: Computers perform computations. Computations can capture other systems' abstract causal organization.

The most controversial part of Chalmers' proposal is that mental properties are "organizationally invariant". Mental properties are of two kinds, psychological and phenomenological. Psychological properties, such as belief and perception, are those that are "characterized by their causal role". He adverts to the work of {{harvnb|Armstrong|1968}} and {{harvnb|Lewis|1972}} in claiming that "[s]ystems with the same causal topology…will share their psychological properties".

Phenomenological properties are not prima facie definable in terms of their causal roles. Establishing that phenomenological properties are amenable to individuation by causal role therefore requires argument. Chalmers provides his Dancing Qualia Argument for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html|title=Absent Qualia, Fading Qualia, Dancing Qualia|accessdate=12 April 2016|date=1995|first=David|last=Chalmers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chalmers begins by assuming that agents with identical causal organizations could have different experiences. He then asks us to conceive of changing one agent into the other by the replacement of parts (neural parts replaced by silicon, say) while preserving its causal organization. Ex hypothesi, the experience of the agent under transformation would change (as the parts were replaced), but there would be no change in causal topology and therefore no means whereby the agent could "notice" the shift in experience.

Critics of AC object that Chalmers begs the question in assuming that all mental properties and external connections are sufficiently captured by abstract causal organization.

=== Ethics ===
{{Main|Ethics of artificial intelligence|Machine ethics|Roboethics}}
If it were suspected that a particular machine was conscious, its rights would be an [[ethics|ethical]] issue that would need to be assessed (e.g. what rights it would have under law). For example, a conscious computer that was owned and used as a tool or central computer of a building or large machine is a particular ambiguity. Should [[law]]s be made for such a case, consciousness would also require a legal definition (for example a machine's ability to experience [[pleasure]] or [[pain]], known as [[sentience]]). Because artificial consciousness is still largely a theoretical subject, such ethics have not been discussed or developed to a great extent, though it has often been a theme in fiction (see below).

The rules for the 2003 [[Loebner Prize]] competition explicitly addressed the question of robot rights:
&lt;blockquote&gt;61. If, in any given year, a publicly available open source Entry entered by the University of Surrey or the Cambridge Center wins the Silver Medal or the Gold Medal, then the Medal and the Cash Award will be awarded to the body responsible for the development of that Entry. If no such body can be identified, or if there is disagreement among two or more claimants, the Medal and the Cash Award will be held in trust ''until such time as the Entry may legally possess, either in the United States of America or in the venue of the contest, the Cash Award and Gold Medal in its own right''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://loebner03.hamill.co.uk/docs/LPC%20Official%20Rules%20v2.0.pdf Loebner Prize Contest Official Rules — Version 2.0] The competition was directed by [[David Hamill]] and the rules were developed by members of the Robitron Yahoo group.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Research and implementation proposals ==

=== Aspects of consciousness ===
There are various aspects of consciousness generally deemed necessary for a machine to be artificially conscious. A variety of functions in which consciousness plays a role were suggested by [[Bernard Baars]] ({{harvnb|Baars|1988}}) and others. The functions of consciousness suggested by Bernard Baars are Definition and Context Setting, Adaptation and Learning, Editing, Flagging and Debugging, Recruiting and Control, Prioritizing and Access-Control, Decision-making or Executive Function, Analogy-forming Function, Metacognitive and Self-monitoring Function, and Autoprogramming and Self-maintenance Function. Igor Aleksander suggested 12 principles for artificial consciousness ({{harvnb|Aleksander|1995}}) and these are: The Brain is a State Machine, Inner Neuron Partitioning, Conscious and Unconscious States, Perceptual Learning and Memory, Prediction, The Awareness of Self, Representation of Meaning, Learning Utterances, Learning Language, Will, Instinct, and Emotion. The aim of AC is to define whether and how these and other aspects of consciousness can be synthesized in an engineered artifact such as a digital computer. This list is not exhaustive; there are many others not covered.

==== Awareness ====
[[Awareness]] could be one required aspect, but there are many problems with the exact definition of ''awareness''. The results of the experiments of [[Mirror neurons#In monkeys|neuroscanning on monkeys]] suggest that a process, not only a state or object, activates neurons. Awareness includes creating and testing alternative models of each process based on the information received through the senses or imagined, and is also useful for making predictions. Such modeling needs a lot of flexibility. Creating such a model includes modeling of the physical world, modeling of one's own internal states and processes, and modeling of other conscious entities.

There are at least three types of awareness:&lt;ref&gt;Joëlle Proust in ''Neural Correlates of Consciousness'', Thomas Metzinger, 2000, MIT, pages 307-324&lt;/ref&gt; agency awareness, goal awareness, and sensorimotor awareness, which may also be conscious or not.  For example, in agency awareness you may be aware that you performed a certain action yesterday, but are not now conscious of it.  In goal awareness you may be aware that you must search for a lost object, but are not now conscious of it.  In sensorimotor awareness, you may be aware that your hand is resting on an object, but are not now conscious of it.

Because objects of awareness are often conscious, the distinction between awareness and consciousness is frequently blurred or they are used as synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;Christof Koch, ''The Quest for Consciousness'', 2004, page 2 footnote 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Memory ====
Conscious events interact with [[memory]] systems in learning, rehearsal, and retrieval.&lt;ref&gt;Tulving, E. 1985. Memory and consciousness. Canadian Psychology 26:1-12&lt;/ref&gt;
The IDA model&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Stan, et al. "The role of consciousness in memory." Brains, Minds and Media 1.1 (2005): 38.&lt;/ref&gt; elucidates the role of consciousness in the updating of perceptual memory,&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Stan. "Perceptual memory and learning: Recognizing, categorizing, and relating." Proc. Developmental Robotics AAAI Spring Symp. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; transient [[episodic memory]], and [[procedural memory]]. Transient episodic and declarative memories have distributed representations in IDA, there is evidence that this is also the case in the nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;Shastri, L. 2002. Episodic memory and cortico-hippocampal interactions. Trends in Cognitive Sciences&lt;/ref&gt; In IDA, these two memories are implemented computationally using a modified version of [[Pentti Kanerva|Kanerva]]’s [[Sparse distributed memory]] architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva, Pentti. Sparse distributed memory. MIT press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Learning ====
Learning is also considered necessary for AC. By Bernard Baars, conscious experience is needed to represent and adapt to novel and significant events ({{harvnb|Baars|1988}}). By [[Axel Cleeremans]] and Luis Jiménez, learning is defined as "a set of philogenetically {{sic}} advanced adaptation processes that critically depend on an evolved sensitivity to subjective experience so as to enable agents to afford flexible control over their actions in complex, unpredictable environments" ({{harvnb|Cleeremans|2001}}).

==== Anticipation ====
The ability to predict (or [[Anticipation (artificial intelligence)|anticipate]]) foreseeable events is considered important for AC by [[Igor Aleksander]].&lt;ref name="Aleksander 1995"&gt;Aleksander 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The emergentist [[Multiple Drafts Model|multiple drafts principle]] proposed by [[Daniel Dennett]] in ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'' may be useful for prediction: it involves the evaluation and selection of the most appropriate "draft" to fit the current environment.  Anticipation includes prediction of consequences of one's own proposed actions and prediction of consequences of probable actions by other entities.

Relationships between real world states are mirrored in the state structure of a conscious organism enabling the organism to predict events.&lt;ref name="Aleksander 1995"/&gt; An artificially conscious machine should be able to anticipate events correctly in order to be ready to respond to them when they occur or to take preemptive action to avert anticipated events. The implication here is that the machine needs flexible, real-time components that build spatial, dynamic, statistical, functional, and cause-effect models of the real world and predicted worlds, making it possible to demonstrate that it possesses artificial consciousness in the present and future and not only in the past. In order to do this, a conscious machine should make coherent predictions and contingency plans, not only in worlds with fixed rules like a chess board, but also for novel environments that may change, to be executed only when appropriate to simulate and control the real world.

==== Subjective experience ====
Subjective experiences or [[qualia]] are widely considered to be ''the'' [[hard problem of consciousness]]. Indeed, it is held to pose a challenge to [[physicalism]], let alone [[computationalism]]. On the other hand, there are problems in other fields of science which limit that which we can observe, such as the [[uncertainty principle]] in physics, which have not made the research in these fields of science impossible.

=== Role of cognitive architectures ===
{{Main|Cognitive architecture}}

The term "cognitive architecture" may refer to a theory about the structure of the human mind, or any portion or function thereof, including consciousness. In another context, a cognitive architecture implements the theory on computers. An example is ''QuBIC: Quantum and Bio-inspired Cognitive Architecture for Machine Consciousness''. One of the main goals of a cognitive architecture is to summarize the various results of cognitive psychology in a comprehensive computer model. However, the results need to be in a formalized form so they can be the basis of a computer program. Also, the role of cognitive architecture is for the A.I. to clearly structure, build, and implement it's thought process.

===Symbolic or hybrid proposals===

====Franklin's Intelligent Distribution Agent====
[[Stan Franklin]] (1995, 2003) defines an [[autonomous agent]] as possessing [[consciousness|functional consciousness]] when it is capable of several of the functions of consciousness as identified by [[Bernard Baars]]' [[Global Workspace Theory]] {{Harvs|last=Baars|year=1988|year2=1997}}. His brain child IDA (Intelligent Distribution Agent) is a software implementation of GWT, which makes it functionally conscious by definition. IDA's task is to negotiate new assignments for sailors in the [[US Navy]] after they end a tour of duty, by matching each individual's skills and preferences with the Navy's needs. IDA interacts with Navy databases and communicates with the sailors via natural language e-mail dialog while obeying a large set of Navy policies. The IDA computational model was developed during 1996–2001 at Stan Franklin's "Conscious" Software Research Group at the [[University of Memphis]]. It "consists of approximately a quarter-million lines of [[Java (programming language)|Java]] code, and almost completely consumes the resources of a 2001 high-end workstation." It relies heavily on ''codelets'', which are "special purpose, relatively independent, mini-agent[s] typically implemented as a small piece of code running as a separate thread." In IDA's top-down architecture, high-level cognitive functions are explicitly modeled (see {{Harvnb|Franklin|1995}} and {{Harvnb|Franklin|2003}} for details). While IDA is functionally conscious by definition, Franklin does "not attribute [[consciousness|phenomenal consciousness]] to his own 'conscious' software agent, IDA, in spite of her many human-like behaviours. This in spite of watching several US Navy detailers repeatedly nodding their heads saying 'Yes, that's how I do it' while watching IDA's internal and external actions as she performs her task."

====Ron Sun's cognitive architecture CLARION====
[[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION]] posits a two-level representation that explains the distinction between conscious and unconscious mental processes.

CLARION has been successful in accounting for a variety of psychological data. A number of well-known skill learning tasks have been simulated using CLARION that span the spectrum ranging from simple reactive skills to complex cognitive skills. The tasks include serial reaction time (SRT) tasks, artificial grammar learning (AGL) tasks, process control (PC) tasks, the categorical inference (CI) task, the alphabetical arithmetic (AA) task, and the Tower of Hanoi (TOH) task {{Harv|Sun|2002}}. Among them, SRT, AGL, and PC are typical implicit learning tasks, very much relevant to the issue of consciousness as they operationalized the notion of consciousness in the context of psychological experiments.

====Ben Goertzel's OpenCog====
[[Ben Goertzel]] is pursuing an embodied AGI through the open-source [[OpenCog]] project. Current code includes embodied virtual pets capable of learning simple English-language commands, as well as integration with real-world robotics, being done at the [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]].

===Connectionist proposals===

====Haikonen's cognitive architecture====
Pentti {{Harvtxt|Haikonen|2003}} considers classical rule-based computing inadequate for achieving AC: "the brain is definitely not a computer. Thinking is not an execution of programmed strings of commands. The brain is not a numerical calculator either. We do not think by numbers." Rather than trying to achieve [[mind]] and [[consciousness]] by identifying and implementing their underlying computational rules, Haikonen proposes "a special [[cognitive architecture]] to reproduce the processes of [[perception]], [[Mental image|inner imagery]], [[Intrapersonal communication|inner speech]], [[pain]], [[pleasure]], [[emotions]] and the [[cognitive]] functions behind these. This bottom-up architecture would produce higher-level functions by the power of the elementary processing units, the [[artificial neuron]]s, without [[algorithms]] or [[computer program|programs]]". Haikonen believes that, when implemented with sufficient complexity, this architecture will develop consciousness, which he considers to be "a style and way of operation, characterized by distributed signal representation, perception process, cross-modality reporting and availability for retrospection." Haikonen is not alone in this process view of consciousness, or the view that AC will spontaneously emerge in [[autonomous agent]]s that have a suitable neuro-inspired architecture of complexity; these are shared by many, e.g. {{Harvtxt|Freeman|1999}} and {{Harvtxt|Cotterill|2003}}. A low-complexity implementation of the architecture proposed by {{Harvtxt|Haikonen|2003}} was reportedly not capable of AC, but did exhibit emotions as expected. See {{Harvtxt|Doan|2009}} for a comprehensive introduction to Haikonen's cognitive architecture. An updated account of Haikonen's architecture, along with a summary of his philosophical views, is given in {{Harvtxt|Haikonen|2012}}.

====Shanahan's cognitive architecture====
[[Murray Shanahan]] describes a cognitive architecture that combines Baars's idea of a global workspace with a mechanism for internal simulation ("imagination") {{Harv|Shanahan|2006}}. For discussions of Shanahan's architecture, see {{Harv|Gamez|2008}} and {{Harv|Reggia|2013}} and Chapter 20 of {{Harv|Haikonen|2012}}.

====Takeno's self-awareness research====
Self-awareness in robots is being investigated by Junichi Takeno&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://robonable.typepad.jp/robot/2_/index.html |title=Robot |accessdate=2007-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703091242/http://robonable.typepad.jp/robot/2_/index.html |archivedate=2007-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Meiji University]] in Japan. Takeno is asserting that he has developed a robot capable of discriminating between a self-image in a mirror and any other having an identical image to it,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rs.cs.meiji.ac.jp/Takeno_Archive.html Takeno - Archive No...]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090203193304/http://www.mimed.mw.tum.de/06-12-18_MIMED_LUETH-002918.PDF The world first self-aware robot and The success of mirror image cognition], Takeno&lt;/ref&gt; and this claim has already been reviewed {{Harv|Takeno|Inaba|Suzuki|2005}}. Takeno asserts that he first contrived the computational module called a MoNAD, which has a self-aware function, and he then constructed the artificial consciousness system by formulating the relationships between emotions, feelings and reason by connecting the modules in a hierarchy (Igarashi, Takeno 2007). Takeno completed a mirror image cognition experiment using a robot equipped with the MoNAD system. Takeno proposed the Self-Body Theory stating that "humans feel that their own mirror image is closer to themselves than an actual part of themselves." The most important point in developing artificial consciousness or clarifying human consciousness is the development of a function of self awareness, and he claims that he has demonstrated physical and mathematical evidence for this in his thesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.s2is.org/Issues/v1/n4/papers/paper4.pdf A Robot Succeeds in 100% Mirror Image Cognition], Takeno, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He also demonstrated that robots can study episodes in memory where the emotions were stimulated and use this experience to take predictive actions to prevent the recurrence of unpleasant emotions (Torigoe, Takeno 2009).

====Aleksander's impossible mind====
[[Igor Aleksander]], emeritus professor of Neural Systems Engineering at [[Imperial College]], has extensively researched [[artificial neural network]]s and claims in his book ''Impossible Minds: My Neurons, My Consciousness'' that the principles for creating a conscious machine already exist but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand [[language]].&lt;ref&gt;Aleksander I (1996) ''Impossible Minds: My Neurons, My Consciousness'', Imperial College Press {{ISBN|1-86094-036-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether this is true remains to be demonstrated and the basic principle stated in ''Impossible Minds''—that the brain is a [[finite state machine|neural state machine]]—is open to doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = RJ | year = 1998 | title = review of ''Impossible Minds'' | url = | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 115–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Michael Graziano's attention schema ====
{{Main|Michael Graziano#The brain basis of consciousness}}

In 2011, [[Michael Graziano]] and Sabine Kastler published a paper named "Human consciousness and its relationship to social neuroscience: A novel hypothesis" proposing a theory of consciousness as an attention schema.&lt;ref name="Graziano, A novel hypothesis"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graziano|first1=Michael|title=Human consciousness and its relationship to social neuroscience: A novel hypothesis|journal=Corn Neurosci.|date=1 January 2011|volume=2|issue=2|pages=98–113|pmc=3223025|doi=10.1080/17588928.2011.565121|pmid=22121395}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Graziano went on to publish an expanded discussion of this theory in his book "Consciousness and the Social Brain".&lt;ref name="Graziano Consciousness and the Social Brain"/&gt; This Attention Schema Theory of Consciousness, as he named it, proposes that the brain tracks attention to various sensory inputs by way of  an attention schema, analogous to the well study body schema that tracks the spatial place of a person's body.&lt;ref name="Graziano Consciousness and the Social Brain"/&gt;  This relates to artificial consciousness by proposing a specific mechanism of information handling, that produces what we allegedly experience and describe as consciousness, and which should be able to be duplicated by a machine using current technology. When the brain finds that person X is aware of thing Y, it is in effect modeling the state in which person X is applying an attentional enhancement to Y. In the attention schema theory, the same process can be applied to oneself. The brain tracks attention to various sensory inputs, and one's own awareness is a schematized model of one's attention. Graziano proposes specific locations in the brain for this process, and suggests that such awareness is a computed feature constructed by an expert system in the brain.

== Testing ==
The most well-known method for testing machine [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] is the [[Turing test]]. But when interpreted as only observational, this test contradicts the philosophy of science principles of [[Theory-ladenness|theory dependence of observations]]. It also has been suggested that Alan Turing's recommendation of imitating not a human adult consciousness, but a human child consciousness, should be taken seriously.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~itamar/Papers/AI_MAG_2011.pdf Mapping the Landscape of Human-Level Artificial General Intelligence]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other tests, such as [http://www.conscious-robots.com/consscale ConsScale], test the presence of features inspired by biological systems, or measure the cognitive development of artificial systems.

Qualia, or phenomenological consciousness, is an inherently first-person phenomenon. Although various systems may display various signs of behavior correlated with functional consciousness, there is no conceivable way in which third-person tests can have access to first-person phenomenological features. Because of that, and because there is no empirical definition of consciousness,&lt;ref&gt;"Consciousness". In Honderich T. The Oxford companion to philosophy. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-926479-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; a test of presence of consciousness in AC may be impossible.

In 2014, Victor Argonov suggested a non-Turing test for machine consciousness based on machine's ability to produce philosophical judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Victor Argonov |title=Experimental Methods for Unraveling the Mind-body Problem: The Phenomenal Judgment Approach |journal=Journal of Mind and Behavior |volume=35 |year=2014 | pages=51–70 | url=http://philpapers.org/rec/ARGMAA-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that a deterministic machine must be regarded as conscious if it is able to produce judgments on all problematic properties of consciousness (such as qualia or binding) having no innate (preloaded) philosophical knowledge on these issues, no philosophical discussions while learning, and no informational models of other creatures in its memory (such models may implicitly or explicitly contain knowledge about these creatures’ consciousness). However, this test can be used only to detect, but not refute the existence of consciousness. A positive result proves that machine is conscious but a negative result proves nothing. For example, absence of philosophical judgments may be caused by lack of the machine’s intellect, not by absence of consciousness.

'''Atomic astrophysics''' is concerned with performing [[atomic physics]] calculations that will be useful to [[astronomer]]s and using atomic data to interpret [[observational astronomy|astronomical observation]]s. Atomic physics plays a key role in [[astrophysics]] as astronomers' only information about a particular [[astronomical object|object]] comes through the light that it emits, and this light arises through [[transition rule|atomic transition]]s.

'''Molecular astrophysics''', developed into a rigorous field of investigation by [[astrochemistry|theoretical astrochemist]] [[Alexander Dalgarno]] beginning in 1967, concerns the study of [[emission spectrum|emission]] from [[molecule]]s in space. There are 110 currently known interstellar molecules. These molecules have large numbers of observable transitions. [[spectral line|Lines]] may also be observed in [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]]—for example the highly [[redshift]]ed lines seen against the gravitationally lensed quasar PKS1830-211. High energy radiation, such as [[ultraviolet light]], can break the molecular bonds which hold atoms in molecules. In general then, molecules are found in cool astrophysical environments. The most massive objects in our [[Milky Way|galaxy]] are giant clouds of molecules and dust known as [[molecular cloud|giant molecular cloud]]s. In these clouds, and smaller versions of them, stars and planets are formed. One of the primary fields of study of molecular astrophysics is [[star formation|star]] and [[nebular hypothesis#formation of planets|planet formation]]. Molecules may be found in many environments, however, from stellar atmospheres to those of planetary satellites. Most of these locations are relatively cool, and molecular emission is most easily studied via [[photon]]s emitted when the molecules make transitions between low rotational energy states. One molecule, composed of the abundant carbon and oxygen atoms, and very stable against dissociation into atoms, is [[carbon monoxide]] (CO). The wavelength of the photon emitted when the CO molecule falls from its lowest excited state to its zero energy, or ground, state is 2.6mm, or 115 [[gigahertz]]. This frequency is a thousand times higher than typical FM radio frequencies. At these high frequencies, molecules in the Earth's atmosphere can block transmissions from space, and telescopes must be located in dry (water is an important atmospheric blocker), high sites. Radio telescopes must have very accurate surfaces to produce high fidelity images.

On February 21, 2014, [[NASA]] announced a [http://www.astrochem.org/pahdb/ greatly upgraded database] for tracking [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs) in the [[universe]]. According to scientists, more than 20% of the [[carbon]] in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible [[PAH world hypothesis|starting materials]] for the [[Abiogenesis#PAH world hypothesis|formation]] of [[Life#Extraterrestrial life|life]]. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the [[Big Bang]], are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with [[Star formation|new stars]] and [[exoplanets]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20140221"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoover |first=Rachel |title=Need to Track Organic Nano-Particles Across the Universe?

A '''bandplan''' or '''band plan''' is a [[plan]] for using a particular [[Radio spectrum#Band|band]] of [[radio frequencies]], that are a portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. Each bandplan defines the frequency range to be included, how [[channel (communications)|channels]] are to be defined, and what will be carried on those channels.  Typical definitions set forth in a bandplan are:

*[[numbering scheme]] – which channel numbers or letters (if any) will be assigned
*[[center frequencies]] – how far apart the [[carrier wave]] for each channel will be
*[[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and/or [[Frequency deviation|deviation]] – how wide each channel will be
*[[spectral mask]] – how extraneous [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]]s will be [[attenuate]]d by frequency
*[[modulation]] – what type will be used or are permissible
*content – what types of information are allowed, such as [[Sound|audio]] or [[video]], [[analog (signal)|analog]] or [[Digital data|digital]]
*[[licensing]] – what the procedure will be to obtain a [[broadcast license]]

The actual authorized frequency bands are defined by the [[ITU]] and the local regulating agencies like the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;For the authorized frequency bands for amateur radio use see: [http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=5a95502a6f6a7a7f7523bdbee72a5b89;rgn=div5;view=text;node=47%3A1.0.1.1.3;idno=47;cc=ecfr Authorized frequency bands.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Barnes–Hut simulation''' (Josh Barnes and [[Piet Hut]]) is an [[approximation algorithm]] for performing an [[n-body simulation|''n''-body simulation]]. It is notable for having [[Big O notation|order]] O(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') compared to a direct-sum algorithm which would be O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbon|first1=Susanne Pfalzner ; Paul|title=Many-body tree methods in physics|date=1996|publisher=[[Cambridge Univ.

The simulation volume is usually divided up into cubic cells via an [[octree]] (in a three-dimensional space), so that only [[Point particle|particles]] from nearby cells need to be treated individually, and particles in distant cells can be treated as a single large particle centered at the cell's [[center of mass]] (or as a low-order [[multipole expansion]]). This can dramatically reduce the number of particle pair interactions that must be computed.

Some of the most demanding [[high-performance computing]] projects do [[computational astrophysics]] using the Barnes–Hut treecode algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;

== Algorithm ==

=== The Barnes–Hut tree ===
In a three-dimensional [[n-body simulation|''n''-body simulation]], the Barnes–Hut algorithm [[Recursion (computer science)|recursively]] divides the ''n'' bodies into groups by storing them in an [[octree]] (or a [[quadtree|quad-tree]] in a 2D simulation). Each [[Node (graph theory)|node]] in this tree represents a region of the three-dimensional space. 
The topmost node represents the whole space, and its eight children represent the eight [[Cartesian coordinate system#Quadrants and octants|octants]] of the space. The space is recursively subdivided into octants until each subdivision contains 0 or 1 bodies (some regions do not have bodies in all of their octants). 
There are two types of nodes in the octree: internal and external nodes. An external node has no children and is either empty or represents a single body. Each internal node represents the group of bodies beneath it, and stores the [[center of mass]] and the total mass of all its children bodies.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Calculating the force acting on a body ===
To calculate the [[net force]] on a particular body, the nodes of the tree are traversed, starting from the root. If the center of mass of an internal node is sufficiently far from the body, the bodies contained in that part of the tree are treated as a single particle whose position and mass is respectively the center of mass and total mass of the internal node. If the internal node is sufficiently close to the body, the process is repeated for each of its children.

Whether a node is or isn't sufficiently far away from a body, depends on the quotient &lt;math&gt;s/d&lt;/math&gt;, where ''s'' is the width of the region represented by the internal node, and ''d'' is the distance between the body and the node’s center of mass. The node is sufficiently far away when this ratio is smaller than a threshold value ''θ''. The parameter ''θ'' determines the accuracy of the simulation; larger values of ''θ'' increase the speed of the simulation but decreases its accuracy. If ''θ'' = 0, no internal node is treated as a single body and the algorithm degenerates to a direct-sum algorithm.

Central Soil Salinity Research Institute (CSSRI) had its origin in [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]], [[Haryana]], on 1 March 1969, as per recommendations of an Indo-American team, employed to assist the [[Indian Council of Agricultural Research]] in developing a comprehensive [[water management]] program for India.  However, by October, 1969, the Institute was shifted to its present premises in Karnal and a year later, the ''Central Rice Research Station'', [[Canning Town]], West Bengal was merged with CSSRI.

The institute has a satellite unit in Bharuch, which was originally started in Anand in 1989, but moved to [[Bharuch]] in 2003 and hosts the coordinating unit of AICRP on ''Management of Salt Affected Soils and Use of Saline Water in Agriculture'' with a network of eight research centres located in different agro ecological regions of the country at [[Agra]], Bapatala, [[Bikaner]], [[Gangawati]], [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]], [[Indore]], [[Kanpur]] and [[Tiruchirapalli]]. The coordinating unit of AICRP on Water Management was a part of CSSRI from early seventies till 1990 when it was moved to [[Rahuri]] in Maharashtra.

The main achievements of CSSRI may be listed as:
* Reclamation of [[alkaline]] soils with the addition of chemical amendments.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Central Soil Salinity Research Institute — 1.

* Reclamation of [[Saline soil|saline]] soils through subsurface drainage.
* Development and release of salt tolerant crop varieties of [[rice]], [[wheat]] and [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
* Reclamation of salt affected soils through salt tolerant trees.
* Development of for the salt affected areas of [[vertisols]] and coastal regions. The Institute has reclaimed nearly 1.5 million hectares of salt affected land for productive use, producing approximately 15 million tons of food grains annually.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
* Development of subsurface drainage technology for waterlogged saline soils. Reclamation has been completed on approximately 50,000 hectares of land in Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
* Replenishment of depleting [[water table]]s by artificial [[ground water]] recharge.

CSSRI manages an International Training Centre under an Indo-Dutch collaboration since 2001. It offers post graduate level programs in association with State Agricultural Universities (SAUs), [[Indian Institute of Technology]] (IIT) and other Universities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

'''''Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand''''' is a non-fiction book about [[climate change denial]], coauthored by Haydn Washington and John Cook, with a foreword by [[Naomi Oreskes]]. Washington had a background in [[environmental science]] prior to authoring the work, and Cook was educated in [[physics]] and founded the website [[Skeptical Science]] which compiles [[peer review|peer-reviewed evidence]] of [[global warming]]. The book was first published in hardcover and paperback formats in 2011 by [[Earthscan]], a division of [[Routledge]].

The book presents an in-depth analysis and refutation of climate change denial, going over several arguments point-by-point and disproving them with [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] evidence from the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus for climate change]]. The authors assert that those denying climate change engage in tactics including [[cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]] data purported to support their specific viewpoints, and attacking the integrity of [[climate scientists]]. They use [[social science]] theory to examine the phenomenon of climate change denial in the wider public, and call this phenomenon a form of [[pathology]].

The book traces financial support for climate change denial to the [[fossil fuel]] industry, asserting these companies have attempted to influence [[public opinion]] on the matter. Washington and Cook write that politicians have a tendency to use [[weasel word]]s as part of a [[propaganda]] tactic through use of [[Spin (public relations)|spin]], as a way to deflect public interest away from climate change and remain passive on the issue. The authors conclude that if the public ceased engaging in denial, the problem of climate change could be realistically addressed.

For his research on the book, and efforts in communicating the essence of climate change science to the general public, John Cook won the 2011 [[Australian Museum]] [[Eureka Prize]] for Advancement of Climate Change Knowledge.&lt;ref name="honour" /&gt; ''Climate Change Denial'' received a positive reception in reviews from publications including: ''[[The Ecologist]]'',&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt; ''[[ECOS (CSIRO magazine)|ECOS]]'' magazine,&lt;ref name="considine" /&gt; [[academic journal]] ''Natures Sciences Sociétés'',&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; the journal ''Education'' published by the [[New South Wales Teachers Federation]],.&lt;ref name="kitson" /&gt; An article in ''[[The New American]]'' was critical, describing the labels of "deniers" and "denialists" as cruel and forms of [[character assassination]].&lt;ref name="jasper" /&gt;

The authors discuss the broader concept of [[denial]] using social science theory, noting its occurrence appears in society when individuals are frightened or ashamed of their actions.&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; They write that these motivations, when expanded from an individual to wider society, present themselves as a form of [[disease]].&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kitson" /&gt; The book identifies climate change denial itself as a pathology afflicting the culture of the planet.&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; The authors lament that an inverse relationship exists between an increasing scientific consensus regarding climate change, and a simultaneous increase in denial within the greater public about the same issue.&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt;

The book identifies a corporate underpinning influencing public opinion by way of companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry.&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words as a form of spin and propaganda, in order to act as if they are going to do something about climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue.&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial&amp;nbsp;— within the wider public itself.&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; They argue that society enables denial of [[climate science]] through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus.&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt;

==Reception==

The book's coauthor John Cook won the 2011 Eureka Prize for Advancement of Climate Change Knowledge, awarded by the [[New South Wales]] Government as part of the Australian Museum Eureka Prizes, and was honoured for his role in communicating the essence of climate change science to the general public.&lt;ref name="honour"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2011/09/top-honour-uq%E2%80%99s-eureka-prize-winners|work=UQ News|publisher=[[University of Queensland]]|title=Top honour for UQ's Eureka Prize winners|accessdate=31 October 2015|date=7 September 2011|archivedate=22 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022225858/http://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2011/09/top-honour-uq%E2%80%99s-eureka-prize-winners}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eurekafinalist"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2011/08/eureka-moment-leading-climate-change-communicator|accessdate=31 October 2015|title=Eureka moment for leading climate change communicator|date=24 August 2011|work=UQ News|publisher=[[University of Queensland]]|archivedate=19 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019114542/http://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2011/08/eureka-moment-leading-climate-change-communicator}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director of the University of Queensland Global Change Institute, Professor [[Ove Hoegh-Guldberg (biologist)|Ove Hoegh-Guldberg]], cited Cook's research and authorship of ''Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand'' as the rationale behind him winning the award.&lt;ref name="eurekafinalist" /&gt;

''The Ecologist'' reviewed the book and described it as: "well researched and painstakingly footnoted".&lt;ref name="ecologist"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[The Ecologist]]|accessdate=31 October 2015|url=http://www.theecologist.org/reviews/books/885054/climate_change_denial.html|title=Climate Change Denial|first=Jeremy|last=Williams|date=12 May 2011|issn=0012-9631|oclc=263593196|archivedate=15 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915060448/http://www.theecologist.org/reviews/books/885054/climate_change_denial.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review concluded: ''Climate Change Denial'' is a wise and timely book.&amp;nbsp;... It deserves an audience".&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt; Writing for ''ECOS'' magazine, Mary-Lou Considine wrote that the book "dissects objections to the peer-reviewed science" in "forensic detail".&lt;ref name="considine" /&gt; Considine recommended the book for those who had previously visited the website Skeptical Science and subsequently wanted to learn more about the wider topic discussed on the site.&lt;ref name="considine" /&gt;

In a review of the book by the academic journal ''Natures Sciences Sociétés'', the authors' thesis was praised for its ability to bring reason to their analysis: "This book shows how we can break through denial, accept reality, and thus solve the climate crisis".&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; ''Natures Sciences Sociétés'' recommended the work for multiple stakeholders, concluding: "It will engage scientists, university students, climate change activists as well as the general public seeking to roll back denial and act".&lt;ref name="natures"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Natures Sciences Sociétés|title=Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand|date=October 2011|volume=19|issue=4|page=474|issn=1240-1307|accessdate=31 October 2015|via=[[EBSCO Host]]|subscription=yes|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/book-reviews/75040268/climate-change-denial-heads-sand|doi=10.1051/nss/2011153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janine Kitson reviewed the book for the journal ''Education'', a publication of the New South Wales Teachers Federation.&lt;ref name="kitson"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Education: Journal of the New South Wales Teachers Federation|publisher=[[New South Wales Teachers Federation]]|first=Janine|last=Kitson|issn=0013-1156|oclc=225337865|page=36|date=8 August 2011|title=Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kitson described the work as timely and important within the context of a need for the public to act before a [[point of no return]]: "This is a crucial book to read before runaway climate change is truly beyond our control".&lt;ref name="kitson" /&gt; Her review concluded: "One can only hope that this book will be read by climate deniers so we can start the challenging journey to an ecologically sustainable future".&lt;ref name="kitson" /&gt;

In ''The New American'', contributor William F. Jasper criticised the book's authors' characterization of those who engage in climate change denial as character assassination.&lt;ref name="jasper"&gt;{{cite news|issn=0885-6540|work=[[The New American]]|url=http://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/environment/item/15457-global-warming-consensus-cooking-the-books|accessdate=31 October 2015|first=William F.|last=Jasper|title=Global Warming 'Consensus': Cooking the Books|date=21 May 2013|archivedate=27 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150727001353/http://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/environment/item/15457-global-warming-consensus-cooking-the-books}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that the labels "deniers" and "denialists" were non-constructive and cruel.&lt;ref name="jasper" /&gt; Jasper disputed the book's thesis that individuals who disagreed with [[Attribution of recent climate change|anthropogenic global warming]] were organised and financed by the fossil fuel industry.&lt;ref name="jasper" /&gt;

The '''competitive Lotka–Volterra equations''' are a simple model of the [[population dynamics]] of species competing for some common resource.  They can be further [[Generalized Lotka–Volterra equation|generalised]] to include trophic interactions.

==Overview==
The form is similar to the [[Lotka–Volterra equations]] for predation in that the equation for each species has one term for self-interaction and one term for the interaction with other species.  In the equations for predation, the base population model is [[exponential function|exponential]].  For the competition equations, the [[Logistic function#Logistic differential equation|logistic equation]] is the basis.

The logistic population model, when used by [[ecology|ecologists]] often takes the following form:

:&lt;math&gt;{dx \over dt} = rx\left(1-{x \over K}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''x'' is the size of the population at a given time, ''r'' is inherent per-capita growth rate, and ''K'' is the [[carrying capacity]].

===Two species===
Given two populations, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with logistic dynamics, the Lotka–Volterra formulation adds an additional term to account for the species' interactions.  Thus the competitive Lotka–Volterra equations are:

:&lt;math&gt;{dx_1 \over dt} = r_1x_1\left(1-\left({x_1+\alpha_{12}x_2 \over K_1}\right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{dx_2 \over dt} = r_2x_2\left(1-\left({x_2+\alpha_{21}x_1 \over K_2}\right) \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''α''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; represents the effect species 2 has on the population of species 1 and ''α''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; represents the effect species 1 has on the population of species 2.  These values do not have to be equal.  Because this is the competitive version of the model, all interactions must be harmful (competition) and therefore all ''α''-values are positive.  Also, note that each species can have its own growth rate and carrying capacity. A complete classification of this dynamics, even for all sign patterns of above coefficients, is available,&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Bomze|I. Bomze]], Lotka–Volterra equation and replicator dynamics: a two-dimensional classification. ''Biological Cybernetics'' 48, 201–211 (1983); [[Immanuel Bomze|I. Bomze]], Lotka–Volterra equation and replicator dynamics: new issues in classification. ''Biological Cybernetics'' 72, 447–453 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; which is based upon equivalence to the 3-type [[replicator equation]].

===''N'' species===
This model can be generalized to any number of species competing against each other.  One can think of the populations and growth rates as [[vector (geometric)|vectors]] and the interaction ''α'''s as a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].  Then the equation for any species ''i'' becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx_i}{dt} = r_i x_i \left(1- \frac{\sum_{j=1}^N \alpha_{ij}x_j}{K_i} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

or, if the carrying capacity is pulled into the interaction matrix (this doesn't actually change the equations, only how the interaction matrix is defined),

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx_i}{dt} = r_i x_i \left( 1 - \sum_{j=1}^N \alpha_{ij}x_j \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the total number of interacting species.  For simplicity all self-interacting terms ''α''&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt; are often set to 1.

===Possible dynamics===
The definition of a competitive Lotka-Volterra system assumes that all values in the interaction matrix are positive or 0 (''α&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≥ 0 for all ''i,j'').  If it is also assumed that the population of any species will increase in the absence of competition unless the population is already at the carrying capacity (''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; 0 for all ''i''), then some definite statements can be made about the behavior of the system.

# The populations of all species will be bounded between 0 and 1 at all times (0 ≤ ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤ 1, for all ''i'') as long as the populations started out positive.
# Smale&lt;ref&gt;S. Smale, J. Math. Biol. '''3''', 5., 1976&lt;/ref&gt; showed that Lotka-Volterra systems that meet the above conditions and have five or more species (''N'' ≥ 5) can exhibit any [[Asymptote|asymptotic]] behavior, including a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]], a [[limit cycle]], an [[Torus|''n''-torus]], or [[Chaotic attractor|attractors]].
# Hirsch&lt;ref&gt;M. Hirsch, SIAM J. Math. Anal. '''16''', 423., 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Hirsch, Nonlinearity '''1''', 51., 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Hirsch, SIAM J. Math. Anal. '''21''', 1225., 1990&lt;/ref&gt; proved that all of the dynamics of the attractor occur on a [[manifold]] of dimension ''N''-1.  This essentially says that the attractor cannot have [[dimension]] greater than ''N''-1.  This is important because a limit cycle cannot exist in fewer than two dimensions, an ''n''-torus cannot exist in less than ''n'' dimensions, and chaos cannot occur in less than three dimensions.  So, Hirsch proved that competitive Lotka–Volterra systems cannot exhibit a limit cycle for ''N'' &lt; 3, or any [[torus]] or chaos for ''N'' &lt; 4.  This is still in agreement with Smale that any dynamics can occur for ''N'' ≥ 5.
#*More specifically, Hirsch showed there is an [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] set ''C'' that is [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the (''N''-1)-dimensional [[simplex]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta_{N-1} = \left \{ x_i : x_i \ge 0, \sum x_i = 1 \right \}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and is a global attractor of every point excluding the origin.  This carrying simplex contains all of the asymptotic dynamics of the system.
# To create a stable ecosystem the α&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; matrix must have all positive eigenvalues.  For large N systems Lotka-Volterra models are either unstable or have low connectivity.  Kondoh&lt;ref&gt;Kondoh M Science 299, 1388 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and Ackland and Gallagher&lt;ref&gt;Ackland GJ and Gallagher ID Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 158701 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; have independently shown that large, stable Lotka-Volterra systems arise if the elements of  α&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; (i.e. the features of the species) can evolve in accordance with natural selection.

==4-dimensional example==
[[Image:4D competitive LV color.png|thumb|right|350px|The competitive Lotka–Volterra system plotted in [[phase space]] with the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; value represented by the color.]]

A simple 4-Dimensional example of a competitive Lotka–Volterra system has been characterized by Vano ''et al.''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Vano, J.A., Wildenberg, J.C., Anderson, M.B., Noel, J.K., Sprott, J.C. Chaos in low-dimensional
Lotka--Volterra models of competition. Nonlinearity, 19, 2391--
2404&lt;/ref&gt;  Here the growth rates and interaction matrix have been set to

:&lt;math&gt;r = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0.72 \\ 1.53 \\ 1.27 \end{bmatrix} \quad \alpha = \begin{bmatrix} 1  &amp; 1.09 &amp; 1.52 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0.44 &amp; 1.36 \\ 2.33 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0.47 \\ 1.21 &amp; 0.51 &amp; 0.35 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;K_i=1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. This system is chaotic and has a largest [[Lyapunov exponent]] of 0.0203.  From the theorems by Hirsch, it is one of the lowest-dimensional chaotic competitive Lotka–Volterra systems.  The Kaplan–Yorke dimension, a measure of the dimensionality of the attractor, is 2.074.  This value is not a whole number, indicative of the [[fractal]] structure inherent in a [[strange attractor]].  The coexisting [[equilibrium point]], the point at which all derivatives are equal to zero but that is not the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]], can be found by [[Invertible matrix|inverting]] the interaction matrix and [[Matrix multiplication|multiplying]] by the unit [[column vector]], and is equal to

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{x} = \left ( \alpha \right )^{-1} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.3013 \\ 0.4586 \\ 0.1307 \\ 0.3557 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that there are always 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; equilibrium points, but all others have at least one species' population equal to zero.

The [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenvalues]] of the system at this point are 0.0414±0.1903''i'', -0.3342, and -1.0319.  This point is unstable due to the positive value of the real part of the [[Complex number|complex]] eigenvalue pair.  If the real part were negative, this point would be stable and the orbit would attract asymptotically.  The transition between these two states, where the real part of the complex eigenvalue pair is equal to zero, is called a [[Hopf bifurcation]].

A detailed study of the parameter dependence of the dynamics was performed by Roques and Chekroun in.&lt;ref name="L.Roques 2011"&gt;L.Roques, and M.D. Chekroun (2011): Probing chaos and biodiversity in a simple competition model, Ecological Complexity, 8 (1), 98--104.&lt;/ref&gt;  
The authors observed that interaction and growth parameters leading respectively to extinction of three species, or coexistence of two, three or four species, are for the most part arranged in large regions with clear boundaries. As predicted by the theory, chaos was also found; taking place however over much smaller islands of the parameter space which makes difficult the identification of their location by a random search algorithm.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These regions where chaos occurs are, in the three cases analyzed  in,&lt;ref name="L.Roques 2011"/&gt; situated at the interface between a non-chaotic four species region and a region where extinction occurs. This implies a high sensitivity of biodiversity with respect to parameter variations in the chaotic regions. Additionally, in regions where extinction occurs which are adjacent to chaotic regions, the computation of local Lyapunov exponents &lt;ref&gt;Nese, J.M., 1989. Quantifying local predictability in phase space. Physica D 35,237--250.&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that a possible cause of extinction is the overly strong fluctuations in species abundances induced by local chaos.

==Spatial arrangements==
[[Image:Competitive LV Spatial Bee Example.JPG|thumb|right|300px|An illustration of spatial structure in nature. The strength of the interaction between bee colonies is a function of their proximity. Colonies ''A'' and ''B'' interact, as do colonies ''B'' and ''C''. ''A'' and ''C'' do not interact directly, but affect each other through colony ''B''.]]

===Background===
There are many situations where the strength of species' interactions depends on the physical distance of separation.  Imagine bee colonies in a field.  They will compete for food strongly with the colonies located near to them, weakly with further colonies, and not at all with colonies that are far away.  This doesn't mean, however, that those far colonies can be ignored.  There is a [[Transitive relation|transitive]] effect that permeates through the system.  If colony ''A'' interacts with colony ''B'', and ''B'' with ''C'', then ''C'' affects ''A'' through ''B''.  Therefore, if the competitive Lotka–Volterra equations are to be used for modeling such a system, they must incorporate this spatial structure.

===Matrix organization===
One possible way to incorporate this spatial structure is to modify the nature of the Lotka–Volterra equations to something like a 
[[reaction-diffusion system]].  It is much easier, however, to keep the format of the equations the same and instead modify the interaction matrix.  For simplicity, consider a five species example where all of the species are aligned on a circle, and each interacts only with the two neighbors on either side with strength ''α''&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; respectively.  Thus, species 3 interacts only with species 2 and 4, species 1 interacts only with species 2 and 5, etc.  The interaction matrix will now be

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{ij} = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; \alpha_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \alpha_{-1} \\ \alpha_{-1} &amp; 1 &amp; \alpha_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \alpha_{-1} &amp; 1 &amp; \alpha_1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \alpha_{-1} &amp; 1 &amp; \alpha_1 \\ \alpha_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \alpha_{-1} &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

If each species is identical in its interactions with neighboring species, then each row of the matrix is just a [[permutation]] of the first row.  A simple, but non-realistic, example of this type of system has been characterized by Sprott ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Sprott, J.C., Wildenberg, J.C., Azizi, Y. A simple spatiotemporal chaotic Lotka–Volterra model. Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals '''26''', 1035., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The coexisting [[equilibrium point]] for these systems has a very simple form given by the [[Inverse element|inverse]] of the sum of the row

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{x}_i = \frac{1}{\sum_{j=1}^N \alpha_{ij}} = \frac{1}{\alpha_{-1} + 1 + \alpha_1}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Lyapunov functions===
A [[Lyapunov function]] is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the system ''f'' = ''f''(''x'') whose existence in a system demonstrates [[Lyapunov stability|stability]].  It is often useful to imagine a Lyapunov function as the energy of the system.  If the derivative of the function is equal to zero for some [[Orbit (dynamics)|orbit]] not including the [[equilibrium point]], then that orbit is a stable [[attractor]], but it must be either a limit cycle or ''n''-torus - but not a [[strange attractor]] (this is because the largest [[Lyapunov exponent]] of a limit cycle and ''n''-torus are zero while that of a strange attractor is positive).  If the derivative is less than zero everywhere except the equilibrium point, then the equilibrium point is a stable fixed point attractor.  When searching a [[dynamical system]] for non-fixed point attractors, the existence of a Lyapunov function can help eliminate regions of parameter space where these dynamics are impossible.

The spatial system introduced above has a Lyapunov function that has been explored by Wildenberg ''et al.''&lt;ref name = Wildenberg&gt;Wildenberg, J.C., Vano, J.A., Sprott, J.C. Complex spatiotemporal dynamics in Lotka–Volterra ring systems. Ecological Complexity '''3''', 140. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  If all species are identical in their spatial interactions, then the interaction matrix is [[circulant matrix|circulant]].  The eigenvalues of a circulant matrix are given by&lt;ref&gt;Hofbauer, J., [[Karl Sigmund|Sigmund, K.]], 1988. The Theory of Evolution and Dynamical Systems. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K, p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_k = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} c_j\gamma^{kj}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''k'' = 0&lt;sub&gt;''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt; and where &lt;math&gt;\gamma = e^{i2\pi/N}&lt;/math&gt; the ''N''th [[root of unity]].  Here ''c&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''j''th value in the first row of the circulant matrix.

The Lyapunov function exists if the real part of the eigenvalues are positive (Re(''λ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; 0 for ''k'' = 0,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''N''/2).  Consider the system where ''α''&lt;sub&gt;−2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a'', ''α''&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b'', ''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''c'', and ''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''d''.  The Lyapunov function exists if

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}(\lambda_k) = \operatorname{Re} \left ( 1+\alpha_{-2}e^{i2 \pi k(N-2)/N}+\alpha_{-1}e^{i2 \pi k(N-1)/N}+\alpha_1e^{i2 \pi k/N}+\alpha_2e^{i4 \pi k/N} \right )&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= 1+(\alpha_{-2}+\alpha_2)\cos \left ( \frac{i4 \pi k}{N} \right ) + (\alpha_{-1}+\alpha_1)\cos \left ( \frac{i2 \pi k}{N} \right ) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;

for k = 0,&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;,''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.  Now, instead of having to integrate the system over thousands of time steps to see if any dynamics other than a fixed point attractor exist, one need only determine if the Lyapunov function exists (note: the absence of the Lyapunov function doesn't guarantee a limit cycle, torus, or chaos).

Example: Let ''α''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.451, ''α''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5, and ''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.237.  If ''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5 then all eigenvalues are negative and the only attractor is a fixed point.  If ''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.852 then the real part of one of the complex eigenvalue pair becomes positive and there is a strange attractor.  The disappearance of this Lyapunov function coincides with a [[Hopf bifurcation]].

===Line systems and eigenvalues===
[[Image:Competitive LV Spatial Eigenvalues.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The eigenvalues of a circle, short line, and long line plotted in the complex plane]]

It is also possible to arrange the species into a line.&lt;ref name=Wildenberg/&gt;  The interaction matrix for this system is very similar to that of a circle except the interaction terms in the lower left and upper right of the matrix are deleted (those that describe the interactions between species 1 and ''N'', etc.).

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{ij} = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; \alpha_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ \alpha_{-1} &amp; 1 &amp; \alpha_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \alpha_{-1} &amp; 1 &amp; \alpha_1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \alpha_{-1} &amp; 1 &amp; \alpha_1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \alpha_{-1} &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This change eliminates the Lyapunov function described above for the system on a circle, but most likely there are other Lyapunov functions that have not been discovered.

The eigenvalues of the circle system plotted in the [[complex plane]] form a [[trefoil]] shape.  The eigenvalues from a short line form a sideways Y, but those of a long line begin to resemble the trefoil shape of the circle.  This could be due to the fact that a long line is indistinguishable from a circle to those species far from the ends.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5712">A '''corrosion inhibitor''' is a [[chemical compound]] that, when added to a liquid or gas, decreases the [[corrosion]] rate of a material, typically a [[metal]] or an [[alloy]].&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Gräfen, Elmar-Manfred Horn, Hartmut Schlecker, Helmut Schindler "Corrosion" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH: Weinheim, 2002. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.b01_08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of a corrosion inhibitor depends on fluid composition, quantity of water, and flow regime. A common mechanism for inhibiting corrosion involves formation of a coating, often a [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] layer, which prevents access of the corrosive substance to the metal. Permanent treatments such as [[chrome plating]] are not generally considered inhibitors, however. Instead corrosion inhibitors are ''additives'' to the fluids that surround the metal or related object.

Corrosion inhibitors are common in industry, and also found in over-the-counter products, typically in spray form in combination with a [[lubricant]] and sometimes a [[penetrating oil]].

==Types==
[[File:CuBTApolymer.png|thumb|[[Benzotriazole]] inhibits corrosion of copper by forming an inert layer of this polymer on the metal's surface]]
The nature of the corrosive inhibitor depends on (i) the material being protected, which are most commonly metal objects, and (ii) on the corrosive agent(s) to be neutralized. The corrosive agents are generally oxygen, hydrogen sulfide, and [[carbon dioxide]]. Oxygen is generally removed by reductive inhibitors such as [[amine]]s and [[hydrazine]]s:
:O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
In this example, [[hydrazine]] converts oxygen, a common corrosive agent, to water, which is generally benign. Related inhibitors of oxygen corrosion are [[hexamine]], [[phenylenediamine]], and [[dimethylethanolamine]], and their derivatives. [[Antioxidant]]s such as sulfite and [[ascorbic acid]] are sometimes used. Some corrosion inhibitors form a [[passivation (chemistry)|passivating coating]] on the surface by [[chemisorption]]. [[Benzotriazole]] is one such species used to protect [[copper]]. For [[lubrication]], [[zinc dithiophosphate]]s are common - they deposit sulfide on surfaces.

The suitability of any given chemical for a task in hand depends on many factors, including their [[operating temperature]].

==Illustrative applications==
*Volatile amines are used in [[boiler]]s to minimize the effects of acid. In some cases, the amines form a protective film on the steel surface and, at the same time, act as an anodic inhibitor. An inhibitor that acts both in a cathodic and anodic manner is termed a ''mixed inhibitor''.
*[[Benzotriazole]] inhibits the corrosion and staining of copper surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;M. Finšgarand and I. Milošev "Inhibition of copper corrosion by 1,2,3-benzotriazole: A review" Corrosion Science 2010, Volume 52, Pages 2737-2749 {{doi|10.1016/j.corsci.2010.05.002}} &lt;/ref&gt;
*Corrosion inhibitors are often added to [[paint]]s. A [[pigment]] with anticorrosive properties is [[zinc phosphate]]. Compounds derived from [[tannic acid]] or zinc salts of organonitrogens (e.g. Alcophor 827) can be used together with anticorrosive pigments. Other corrosion inhibitors are Anticor 70, Albaex, Ferrophos, and Molywhite MZAP.
*[[Antiseptic]]s are used to counter [[microbial corrosion]]. [[Benzalkonium chloride]] is commonly used in [[oil field]] industry.
*In oil refineries, [[hydrogen sulfide]] can corrode steels so it is removed often using air and amines by conversion to [[polysulfide]]s.
===Fuels industry===
Corrosion inhibitors are commonly added to [[antifreeze (coolant)|coolant]]s, fuels, [[hydraulic fluid]]s, [[boiler water]], [[engine oil]], and many other fluids used in industry. For fuels, various corrosion inhibitors can be used. Some components include [[zinc dithiophosphate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050218035909/http://www.octel-starreon.com/Products_RFA_Corrosion.htm Octel-Starreon Refinery Fuel Additives Corrosion Inhibitors for hydrocarbon fuels - corrosion inhibitor and corrosion protection to fuel distribution system]&lt;/ref&gt;
* DCI-4A, widely used in commercial and military [[jet fuel]]s, acts also as a [[lubricity]] additive. Can be also used for [[gasoline]]s and other [[distillate]] fuels.
* DCI-6A, for motor gasoline and distillate fuels, and for [[U.S. military]] fuels ([[JP-4]], [[JP-5]], [[JP-8]])
* DCI-11, for alcohols and gasolines containing [[oxygenate]]s
* DCI-28, for very low-pH alcohols and gasolines containing oxygenates
* DCI-30, for gasoline and distillate fuels, excellent for pipeline transfers and storage, caustic-resistant

{{refimprove|date=February 2018}}
In the [[broadcasting]] [[industry]], a '''dark''' [[television station|television]] or '''silent''' [[radio station]] is one that has gone [[off the air]] for an indefinite period of time. Usually unlike [[dead air]] (broadcasting only silence), a station that is dark or silent does not even transmit a [[carrier wave|carrier signal]].

==U.S. law==

===Transmitter operations===
According to the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), a radio or television station is considered to have gone dark or silent if it is to be off the air for 30 days or longer.  Prior to the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]], a "dark" station was required to surrender its [[broadcast license]] to the FCC, leaving it vulnerable to another party applying for it while its current owner was making efforts to get it back on the air.  Following the 1996 landmark [[legislation]], a licensee is no longer required to surrender the license while dark.  Instead, the licensee may apply for a "Notification of Suspension of Operations/Request for Silent STA" (FCC Form 0386), stating the reason why the station has gone silent.

A service can go dark for any number of reasons, including financial resources being drained to continue effective operation of the service as being of [[public good|benefit]] to its [[community of license]]; abandonment for a different channel or to go [[cable TV|cable]]-only; complicated technical adjustments involving [[radio antenna]] repair, requiring the [[mast radiator|broadcast tower]] to be de-energized for the work to be done; [[structure fire]] or [[natural disaster]] that has rendered the facility inoperable; or technical adjustments that would make it prohibitively expensive to perform the work and carry on the normal operations of the station in question.

The service is not required to notify the FCC of silence if the period of silence is less than 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/silent-am-and-fm-broadcast-station-lists |title=Silent AM and FM Broadcast Station Lists |publisher=FCC |date= |accessdate=2014-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108072241/http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/silent-am-and-fm-broadcast-station-lists |archivedate=2012-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the period of silence is to last at least 10 days but less than 30 days, the licensee must notify the FCC in writing explaining why the service is silent and an expected return to the air.  A service that expects to be silent for more than 30 days must apply to the FCC using Form 0386, which can be done electronically (preferred method) or by a paper application.  On this application, the date the station has gone dark or its targeted date to go silent must be stated on the application, along with the reason for silence.  The Silent STA ([[special temporary authority]]) is valid for a period of 180 days.  If the station is required to remain off the air beyond the 180-day period, a "Request to Extend STA" must be subsequently filed, along with the reason. However, any broadcast station that is dark (or transmits using facilities different from their license except for operation under STA) for 12 months has their license automatically canceled as a matter of law pursuant to section 312g of the Communications Act as amended. Some stations have been known to re-appear for a week or 2 to keep the license alive (WCKL when owned by the Black United Fund was famous for this as they did it for years) then applying for yet another silent STA.

===Tower-light markings===
While a licensed station is silent, it must continue to meet tower lighting and marking requirements as per [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) [[:wikt:mandate|mandate]].  If a station (silent or otherwise) must shut down its lighting system for an extended period of time (such as it being disabled by a [[lightning]] strike), it is required to notify the FAA immediately.  The station is required to provide the FAA with its assigned tower number, latitude and longitude coordinates, and an anticipated time that the tower light operations will resume.  A licensee has 15 days to make the necessary repairs until the FCC is notified by the FAA.  Once repairs are made, the FAA must be notified that all is well.

===Telecommunications Act of 1996===
The [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] was created in part to increase the [[accountability]] of broadcasters, while providing requested [[deregulation]] in response to the [[wikt:hardship|hardship]]s of many small-town broadcasters with small audiences and revenues.  Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, licensees of stations that were listed as "silent" by the FCC (at the time around 400) were warned to either power their facilities back up or their licenses would be canceled permanently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/decdoc/letter/1996--10--17--silent.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929073826/http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/decdoc/letter/1996--10--17--silent.html |date=September 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FCC did allow reasonable provision for broadcasters who notified them that they were trying to get back on the air.  Nevertheless, many licenses were canceled, primarily those with abandoned facilities.

'''Digital civics''' refers a range of [[Ethics|ethical]] and responsible civic behaviours, [[citizenship]], or democratic engagement in the [[Internet|digital realm]]. The term itself is still establishing currency.

== Context ==

Digital civics has arisen from concerns regarding the challenges faced by individuals and society in the digital age. As science and technology have advanced, so too has human understanding of their place in the world. This has altered the way people interact with one another and the broader context in which they exist. Digital civics respond to these challenges by formulating a robust foundation upon which initiatives into digital citizenship and digital citizen engagement can be developed.

== Definitions ==

Researcher Estelle Clements defines digital civics as “the study of the rights and responsibilities of citizens who inhabit the infosphere and access the world digitally.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Clements, who was a doctoral researcher at the [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] at the time, first put forward this definition in 2010 as part of an educational project done in conjunction with the [[Dublin City Public Libraries and Archive]]. The goal of their project was to teach about life in the online world.

According to Clements this definition meets three objectives:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

# It promotes an understanding of the environment where civic actions take place;
# It acknowledges the information philosophy that underpins this environment;
# It endorses the policy discourse that addresses the basic rights and ethical responsibilities of citizens.

Other conceptions of digital civics are still emerging. [[Newcastle University]] has suggested that Digital Civics is about “Digital technologies and citizen-driven design”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcivics.io/about/|title=About|website=digitalcivics.io|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy of information ==

Numerous scholars have suggested that the [[Philosophy of Information]] is the most logical course to underpin policy and project work for life in the digital age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Media Ethics.|last=Ess|first=Charles|publisher=Polity Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Floridi|first=Luciano|date=2009|title=The Information Society and its Philosophy|url=|journal=The Information Society|volume=25(3)|pages=153–158.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Information Philosopher [[Luciano Floridi]] has played a critical role in the success of such work, particularly in exploration of [[Information society|Information Society]], European Policy, and [[European Commission]]’s Onlife initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783319040929|title=The Onlife Manifesto - Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era {{!}} Luciano Floridi|publisher=Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

Clements identifies four underlying pillars that contribute to a robust digital civics as well as four key concepts in which digital civics is grounded.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Estelle|first=Clements,|date=2017|title=Digital Civics in Pedagogy: A Response to the Challenges of Digital Convergence in the Educational Environment|url=https://arrow.dit.ie/appadoc/88/|journal=ARROW@DIT|language=en|doi=10.21427/D7J45F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcivics.org/about/|title=What is Digital Civics|last=|first=|date=2018|website=digitalcivics.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Underlying pillars of Digital Civics   ===

Philosophy (specifically the [[Philosophy of information|Philosophy of Information]] as described by Luciano Floridi&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luciano|first=Floridi|date=2002|title=What is the philosophy of information|url=|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=33|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  
 
History (drawing from [[Media ecology|Media Ecology]] and [[Classics|Classical scholarship]]),

Ethics (particularly [[Virtue ethics|Virtue Ethics]])

Civics (including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], as well as a conjoining of the public and private personas called Hybrid selves&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ess|first=Charles|date=2010|title=The Embodied Self in a Digital Age: Possibilities, Risks, and Prospects for a Pluralistic (democratic/liberal) Future?|url=|journal=Nordicom Information|volume=32(2)|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Key concepts for Digital Civics ===
- It acknowledges the transformations in human life and our world brought about by new scientific breakthroughs and technological developments, and the impact these changes have on how we behave.

- It recognises the importance of responding to these changes in ethical and intellectually rigorous ways.

- And it appreciates that we have a long historical tradition from which to draw when addressing these challenges.

- Fundamental to Digital Civics is an appreciation of the informational nature of reality.

== Contention of digital civics and virtue ethics ==

In considering the ethical issues that arise from digital age civic issues, numerous scholars have suggested that such ethical initiatives should use [[virtue ethics]] as a basis for a shared global [[information ethics]]: namely, Charles Ess,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charles|first=Ess|date=2010|title=Trust and New Communications Technologies: Vicious Circles, Virtuous Circles, Possible Futures.|url=|journal=Knowledge, Technology &amp; Policy|volume=23(3-4)|pages=287–305|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Shannon Vallor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology and the Virtues: A philosophical guide to a future worth wanting.|last=Vallor|first=Shannon|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard Volkman&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Volkman|first=Richard|date=2010|title=Why Information Ethics must begin with Virtue Ethics|url=|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=41|pages=380–401|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2010). In her doctoral work on digital civics pedagogy, Clements suggests that her findings were compatible with a framework of virtue ethics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the Information philosopher [[Luciano Floridi]] asserts that a global information ethics cannot be built upon virtue ethics because virtue ethics is “intrinsically egopoeitic”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ethics of Information|last=Floridi|first=Luciano|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Oxford, UK|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus does not take into account responsibilities owed to the surrounding community or environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge handbook of information and computer ethics|last=Floridi|first=Luciano|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, this matter is still contested.

== Educational programs ==

In 2010, the first pedagogical program for digital civics was started by the Oscar Wilde Facebook Laboratory. It was a collaboration between [[Dublin City Public Libraries and Archive]] and the [[Dublin Institute of Technology]]'s, Estelle Clements. A global team of researchers and educators created a multi-platform (online and offline) learning environment to teach students and the public about digital civics. The project formed the basis of Clements’ doctoral work which formulated a Model for Digital Civics in [[Pedagogy]]. At the time, Clements was particularly concerned that new digital citizenship initiatives were not considering the necessary underlying philosophical and ethical issues raised by the digital age and sought to provide a robust foundation to solve this problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2014 Newcastle University, launched a program to teach digital civics to postgraduate students at their Open Lab . The program research concentrates on “exploring how digital technologies can empower citizens and communities”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcivics.io/|title=Digital Civics at Open Lab|website=digitalcivics.io|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and “trains doctoral students in the design, deployment and evaluation of community-driven digital technologies and services.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcivics.io/apply/|title=Centre for Doctoral Training in Digital Civics|website=digitalcivics.io|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[The MacArthur Research Network on Youth and Participatory Politics (YPP) released a digital civics toolkit described as: “a collection of resources for educators to support youth to explore, recognize, and take seriously the civic potentials of digital life.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitalcivicstoolkit.org/|title=Digital Civics Toolkit|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The toolkit draws heavily from digital media literacy, focusing on 5 modules: Exploring Community Issues, Investigation, Dialogue, Voice, and Action”.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14426">'''Dominator culture''' refers to a model of society where fear and force maintain rigid understandings of power and superiority within a hierarchical structure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.second-congress-matriarchal-studies.com/eisler.html|title=The Battle Over Human Possibilities: Women, Men, and Cultural Transformation|last=Eisler|first=Riane|date=1 October 2005|website=Societies of Peace|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Futurist and writer [[Riane Eisler]] first popularized this term in her book ''[[The Chalice and the Blade]]'' (Harper Collins San Francisco, 1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Chalice and the Blade|last=Eisler|first=Riane|publisher=HarperOne|year=1987|isbn=978-0062502896|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Eisler positions the dominator model in contrast to the partnership model, a more egalitarian structure of society founded on mutual respect among its inhabitants. In dominator culture, men rule over women, whereas partnership culture values men and women equally. Other theorists, including [[Terence McKenna]] and [[bell hooks]], have expanded on the implications and impact of dominator culture.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=Atria Books|year=2003|isbn=0743456084|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food of the Gods: The Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge|last=McKenna|first=Terence|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1993|isbn=0553371304|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They, among others, argue that adherence to the dominator model over the partnership model denies the possibility of a more equal society, systematically allowing for the persecution of those who are “dominated”—including racial and ethnic minorities, LGBT people, and women.

== Concept and terminology ==
Riane Eisler presents dominator culture as a cultural construction of the roles and relations of women and men, where men “dominate,” or are in control within society. Regardless of the location, time period, religious beliefs, or advancements in technology, a society might follow the dominator culture model. Eisler characterizes dominator culture as featuring four core elements:
* an authoritarian social and family structure
* rigid male dominance
* a high level of violence and abuse
* and a system of beliefs that normalizes such a society&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eisler|first=Riane|year=2015|title=Human Possibilities: The Interaction of Biology and Culture|url=http://pubs.lib.umn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&amp;context=ijps|journal=Interdisciplinary Journal of Partnership Studies|volume=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The dominator model is framed in contrast to the partnership model. In a sort of reversal of the elements of dominator culture, the partnership model is characterized by:
* organization according to the ideals of a democratic structure
* equal partnership between men and women
* a lack of tolerance for abuse and violence
* and belief systems that validate an empathetic perspective&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
By juxtaposing dominator culture with partnership culture, Eisler creates a continuum between the two. She argues that where a society falls on this spectrum influences its culture, beliefs, and actions. Adherence to dominator culture affects people from a personal to a public level, as seen in its societal impact.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Historical context ===

The prevalence of dominator culture has shifted over time. Eisler claims that, in the prehistory of humans, partnership used to be the norm. In both the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods, there are examples of matriarchal societies preceding patriarchies. British archeologist [[James Mellaart]], for example, reported a Neolithic site with many female images and no signs of destructive warfare for almost 1000 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For thousands of years, people lived in these peaceful partnership societies, until warlike nomadic tribes disrupted the balance with their dominator cultures. Since then, fluctuations between dominator and partnership societies have occurred over time, but the primary shift has been towards dominator culture.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.authorsden.com/visit/viewarticle.asp?id=34997|title=Dominator v Partnership Societies and Relationships|last=Hollick|first=Malcolm|date=2007|website=Author's Den|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2017}}

== Societal impact ==
Dominator culture impacts the way a society appears and functions. Riane Eisler posits that “narratives about our cultural origins,” like dominator culture, “reflect and guide how we think, feel, and act.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though no culture is fully dominator or fully partnership in its construction, the degree to which it aligns with one of these models impacts the beliefs, institutions, and relationships of that society.

=== Gender inequalities ===
The main distinction between the dominator and partnership models, according to Eisler, is their treatment of the relationships between men and women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She argues that, historically, men have been the dominators, leading to [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] society that upholds constricting, traditional gender roles. Surveys by anthropologists Peggy R. Sanday and Scott Coltrane support this connection, showing the correlation between a society’s structure and the expectations for men and women. They found that greater equality between men and women led to greater male involvement in childcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Female Power and Male Dominance: On the Origins of Sexual Inequality|last=Sanday|first=Peggy R.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1981|isbn=0521280753|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because dominator culture upholds a harsh division between masculinity and femininity, it dissociates masculinity from anything stereotypically feminine—even at the expense of benefits such as those reported by Sanday and Coltrane. Accordingly, in these societies that prize domination and power, the societal value for qualities like empathy, caregiving, and nonviolence diminishes. Instead, by viewing femininity as undesirable and inferior, these dominator societies accept and perpetuate violent and inequitable behavior.

=== Power disparities ===
In dominator culture, society reinforces such hierarchies by presenting the dominator model as the natural order of society. According to Eisler, some sociobiologists and psychologists claim that male dominance is inherent in human genes and a product of evolution, demonstrating dominator thinking.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Theorist bell hooks has expanded on this, indicating that dominator culture “teaches us that we are all natural-born killers but that males are more able to realize the predator role.” &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By accepting male dominance as a genetic imperative, society justifies a dominator structure. Consequently, this situates the desire to overpower and control others as part of human identity, according to hooks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

This hierarchical disparity is not only explained genetically but societally reinforced, extending to “power” more generally. Although Eisler often distinguishes between the two models on the basis of gender, she also applies these hierarchies more broadly to other societal constructions of power, like race, class, and age. Terence McKenna, a friend of Eisler’s and fellow writer, asserts that Eisler's book ''The Chalice and the Blade'' “de-genderized the terminology,” framing it as a contrast between dominator and partnership ideologies, rather than just an indictment of patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Archaic Revival|last=McKenna|first=Terence|publisher=Harper Collins|year=1992|isbn=0062506137|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting this interpretation, Eisler argues that society’s requirement of children to be submissive and obedient to their parents reflects the influence of dominator culture. Dominator culture encourages the ideology, from childhood, that one either dominates or is dominated. Accordingly, dominator culture not only equates the difference between men and women to superiority and inferiority, but rather “frame[s] all relationships as power struggles."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Historical and cultural implications ==
Dominator culture has had varying manifestations in society throughout the course of human history, from the prehistoric warlike tribes of the Neolithic era to present-day displays. The dominator structure of society dictates and shapes the culture that accompanies it. Other authors have used, expanded on, and interpreted Riane Eisler’s idea of dominator culture to apply it to a wide range of fields, as far-reaching as nursing, war, language learning, economics, and [[ecofeminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bortoluzzi|first=Maria|year=2003|title=Language Learning Approaches and Some Aspects of the Partnership Model|url=http://search.proquest.com.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/mlaib/docview/53789232/B3BCFF0A700B46ABPQ/1?accountid=4485|journal=The Art of Partnership: Essays on Literature, Culture, Language, and Education Towards a Cooperative Paradigm|volume=|pages=159–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirk|first=Mary|year=2010|title=Review: The Real Wealth of Nations|url=|journal=Feminist Teacher|volume=20|pages=266–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical and cultural manifestations ===

Author Malcolm Hollick cites [[Nazi Germany]], Stalinist Russia, and Islamic fundamentalist states as modern, though severe, examples of dominator societies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2017}} The Nazi claim to power, for example, was also accompanied by the call for women’s return to “traditional,” or subservient, places in family structures. However, manifestations of dominator culture are not always so extreme; the effects of dominator culture often manifest in pervasive and subtle ways in society. In the United States, the [[War on Terror|wars on terror]], [[War on Drugs|drugs]], and [[War on crime|crime]] perpetuate the use of force to achieve an end and indicate a lessening of certain freedoms.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2017}} On a larger scale, sex-slavery, forced marriage, and the acceptance of wife-beating persist around the world. Though the Western world has made considerable strides towards a more partnership society in the past few centuries—Western society boasts of freedom of speech, access to education, political participation, gay rights, and women in the workforce—the shift towards the partnership model is neither universal nor complete.

Similarly, dominator culture threatens the preservation of the environment. Hierarchical societies that value claiming control justify humans' claims of dominion over nature. Terence McKenna expanded on Eisler’s work, using the idea of dominator culture to illuminate the character of what he sees as Western patriarchal culture—indicating, for example, his claims that it perennially lacks social conscience and lacks concern for the environment. He argues that, “The entire structure of dominator culture… is based upon our alienation from nature, from ourselves, and from each other.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As a result, dominator culture not only accepts but justifies the pollution and destruction of the environment. [[Daniel Quinn]], a philosophical and environmental writer, takes on these issues in his novel ''[[Ishmael (novel)|Ishmael]]'', characterizing dominator culture as Taker culture and detailing its incompatibility with the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ishmael|last=Quinn|first=Daniel|publisher=Bantam|year=1995|isbn=0553375407|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been used and expanded upon by other writers, such as{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}
* [[Carol J. Adams]] in ''[[The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory]]''
* [[Fritjof Capra]] in ''[[The Turning Point (book)|The Turning Point]]''
* [[Thom Hartmann]] in ''[[The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight]]''
* [[Leonard Shlain]] in ''[[The Alphabet Versus the Goddess]]''
* [[Starhawk]] in ''[[Dreaming the Dark]]''
* [[bell hooks]] in ''Teaching Community: A Pedagogy of Hope''

=== Consequences for the future ===

Despite the stability and fairness characteristic of partnership society, dominator culture often still takes precedence. Eisler argues that blindly accepting dominator culture as part of the genetic, natural order of the world excuses human responsibility. When people understand dominator culture as a genetic imperative, they ignore environmental influences, including parenting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This perpetuates the cycle of dominator culture and ignores scientific findings that contradict the supposedly genetic nature of violence. By accepting dominator culture as the norm, people discount their own claim to agency. However, in her article “Love as the Practice of Freedom,” bell hooks offers a potential counter to dominator culture. She states that love—the “longing to connect with someone radically different”—led people to overcome dominator thinking in action, whether the issue was “ending racism, sexism, homophobia, or class elitism.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=hooks|first=bell|year=2006|title=Love as the Practice of Freedom|url=http://collectiveliberation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/hooks_Love_As_The_Practice_Of_Freedom.pdf|journal=Outlaw Culture|volume=|pages=|via=Collective Liberation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Eisler acknowledges that cultural transformation does not happen on its own; however, she asserts, “Many of us worldwide are working for cultural transformation, for a shift to a more peaceful, equitable, and sustainable way of relating to one another and our Mother Earth.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1175">'''Dynamic timing verification''' refers to verifying that an [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] design is fast enough to run without errors at the targeted clock rate.  This is accomplished by simulating the design files used to synthesize the [[integrated circuit]] (IC) design.  This is in contrast to [[static timing analysis]], which has a similar goal as dynamic timing verification except it does not require simulating the real functionality of the IC.&lt;ref name="ASIC world"&gt;"ASIC world: vol 10", page 13, October 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbyists often perform a type of dynamic timing verification when they over-clock the CPUs in their computers in order to find the fastest clock rate at which they can run the CPU without errors.  This is a type of dynamic timing verification that is performed after the silicon is manufactured.  In the field of ASIC design, this timing verification is preferably performed before manufacturing the IC in order to make sure that IC works under the required conditions before mass production of the IC.&lt;ref name="ASIC world"/&gt;

'''EF-Tu receptor''', abbreviated as '''EFR''', is a [[Pattern recognition receptor|pattern-recognition receptor]] (PRR) that binds to the prokaryotic protein [[EF-Tu]] (elongation factor thermo unstable) in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''.   This receptor is an important part of the plant immune system as it allows the plant cells to recognize and bind to EF-Tu, preventing genetic [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] and protein synthesis in pathogens such as ''Agrobacterium''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zipfel|first=Cyril|last2=Kunze|first2=Gernot|last3=Chinchilla|first3=Delphine|last4=Caniard|first4=Anne|last5=Jones|first5=Jonathan D.G.|last6=Boller|first6=Thomas|last7=Felix|first7=Georg|title=Perception of the Bacterial PAMP EF-Tu by the Receptor EFR Restricts Agrobacterium-Mediated Transformation|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867406005010|journal=Cell|volume=125|issue=4|pages=749–760|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.03.037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The plant ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' has a genome with only around 135 megabase pairs (Mbp), making it small enough to fully synthesize. It also makes it relative easy to study, leading to its use as a common [[model organism]] in the field of plant genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabidopsis.org/portals/genAnnotation/gene_structural_annotation/agicomplete.jsp|title=TAIR - Genome Assembly|website=www.arabidopsis.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rensink|first=W.

Plant pathogens are able to travel through a plant's vascular system, but plants do not have specific immune cells that can travel this way. Plants also do not have an adaptive immune system, so other forms of immunity are required. One is the use of pattern-recognition receptors (PRR) to bind to [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern]]s (PAMP), which are highly-conserved structures on the outside of many invasive organisms. This form of immunity acts on intercellular pathogens, which are ones outside of individual plant cells. PRRs are [[transmembrane protein]]s, which have an anchor inside the cell and portions that extend beyond the membrane. They are part of the innate immune system and bind to and prevent the proliferation of pathogens with the PAMPs that they can bind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Jonathan D. G.|last2=Dangl|first2=Jeffery L.|date=2006-11-16|title=The plant immune system|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7117/full/nature05286.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=444|issue=7117|pages=323–329|doi=10.1038/nature05286|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EF-Tu, a very common and highly conserved protein, is an example of a PAMP that can be found in numerous pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yamamoto|first=Hiroshi|last2=Qin|first2=Yan|last3=Achenbach|first3=John|last4=Li|first4=Chengmin|last5=Kijek|first5=Jaroslaw|last6=Spahn|first6=Christian M.

When a protein is being formed, amino acids are connected in a long sequence, known as a protein's primary structure. Elongation factors help coordinate the movement of [[transfer RNA]]s (tRNA) and [[messenger RNA]]s (mRNA) so they stay aligned as the ribosome translocates along the mRNA chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramakrishnan|first=V.|date=2002-02-22|title=Ribosome structure and the mechanism of translation|journal=Cell|volume=108|issue=4|pages=557–572|issn=0092-8674|pmid=11909526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its importance in ensuring the accuracy of translation and preventing mutations, EF-Tu is a good target of both immune systems and drug therapies designed to prevent infections and subsequent diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krab|first=Ivo M.|last2=Parmeggiani|first2=Andrea|date=2002|title=Mechanisms of EF-Tu, a pioneer GTPase|journal=Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology|volume=71|pages=513–551|issn=0079-6603|pmid=12102560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological function ==

=== Synthesis ===
EFR, like other proteins, undergoes translation in a cell's ribosomes. After the primary structure of the protein has been formed it must fold into its three dimensional [[Protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] to become functional. This occurs in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER). While in the ER, this primary polypeptide chain undergoes a regulatory process known as ER-quality control (ER-QC) to help ensure it folds into the correct 3-D structure. and avoids. ER-QC process consists of a series of chaperone proteins that help guide the folding of the EFR polypeptide chains, preventing the aggregation of many polypeptide chains into one large group. Proteins that have not folded are kept in the ER until they have folded into their correct 3-D shape. If folding does not occur then the unfolded protein is eventually destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anelli|first=Tiziana|last2=Sitia|first2=Roberto|date=2008-01-23|title=Protein quality control in the early secretory pathway|url=http://emboj.embopress.org/content/27/2/315|journal=The EMBO Journal|language=en|volume=27|issue=2|pages=315–327|doi=10.1038/sj.emboj.7601974|issn=0261-4189|pmid=18216874|pmc=2234347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nekrasov|first=Vladimir|last2=Li|first2=Jing|last3=Batoux|first3=Martine|last4=Roux|first4=Milena|last5=Chu|first5=Zhao-Hui|last6=Lacombe|first6=Severine|last7=Rougon|first7=Alejandra|last8=Bittel|first8=Pascal|last9=Kiss‐Papp|first9=Marta|date=2009-11-04|title=Control of the pattern‐recognition receptor EFR by an ER protein complex in plant immunity|url=http://emboj.embopress.org/content/28/21/3428|journal=The EMBO Journal|language=en|volume=28|issue=21|pages=3428–3438|doi=10.1038/emboj.2009.262|issn=0261-4189|pmid=19763086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the control mechanisms of EFR is the protein Arabidopsis stromal-derived factor-2 (SDF2). A genetic variant of the ''A. thaliana'' plant that did not have the gene to encode for this protein had a far lower production of functional EFR proteins. SDF2 also cannot be substituted for other enzymes in EFR production. Experimental analysis indicated that EFR is destroyed in the cell when it is produced without SDF2, though the mechanism of this action is unknown. Other proteins that are required for the proper synthesis of EFR include Arabidopsis CRT3 and UGGT, which are members of the EFR-QC and act as [[Chaperone (protein)|chaperones]] to help folding.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Role in plant immunity ===
EFR receptors have a high affinity for the EF-Tu PAMP. This has been proven analytically through competitive binding assays and [[SDS-page|SDS-PAGE]] analysis. When EFR binds to EF-Tu, the basal resistance is activated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This response happens after an infection has already been established and it is important to the plant immune system because it prevents the spread of the pathogen throughout the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niks|first=Rients E.|last2=Marcel|first2=Thierry C.|date=2009-06-01|title=Nonhost and basal resistance: how to explain specificity?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02849.x/abstract|journal=New Phytologist|language=en|volume=182|issue=4|pages=817–828|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02849.x|issn=1469-8137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only bacteria that have a high amount of EF-Tu are effectively inhibited by EFR, such as ''Agrobacterium tumefaciens''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Similarities to FLS2 ===
Like EFR, FLS2 (flagellin-sensing 2) is a plant receptor-like kinase that acts as a PRR in the plant innate immune system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gómez-Gómez|first=L.|last2=Boller|first2=T.|date=June 2000|title=FLS2: an LRR receptor-like kinase involved in the perception of the bacterial elicitor flagellin in Arabidopsis|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=5|issue=6|pages=1003–1011|issn=1097-2765|pmid=10911994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of binding to EF-Tu, it binds to [[flagellin]], another highly conserved structure present on many pathogens. It, like EF-Tu, is a good target for the plant immune system since it is so widespread. It also triggers an immune response in a larger variety of plants than EF-Tu.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The immune response triggered by FLS2 is very similar to the one that is triggered by EFR and the enzymes that are activated by both receptors likely come from a common pool that is found in many cells. This indicates that the two receptor pathways converge, which has been shown to occur at the ion channels in the plasma membrane.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jeworutzki|first=Elena|last2=Roelfsema|first2=M.

== Applications ==
EFR is found only in the ''[[Brassicaceae]]'' family of plants, meaning it has a limited effect in nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Experiments have demonstrated the ability to successfully transfer EFR to plants in other families, such as ''[[Nicotiana benthamiana]]'', a relative of tobacco, and ''[[Tomato|Solanum lycopersicum]]'', the tomato plant. The ability to transfer PRRs between plants and have them retain their effectiveness broadens genetic engineering techniques to promote disease resistance in crops. It can also reduce chemical wastes associated with mass agriculture and enable the transfer of immunity rapidly and without traditional breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lacombe|first=Séverine|last2=Rougon-Cardoso|first2=Alejandra|last3=Sherwood|first3=Emma|last4=Peeters|first4=Nemo|last5=Dahlbeck|first5=Douglas|last6=van Esse|first6=H.

It was later sold to [[Sportal]] in 1999 but after its collapse in 2001, the site was set for closure but was saved by a consortium of rugby lovers who bought the site for £100,000 from Sportal and ran the site under the name "Scrum Ltd" and paying for the sites maintenance from their own pocket for the next 6 years

In August 2007, American sports media company [[ESPN]] bought the site in collaboration with [[Disney Interactive|Walt Disney Internet Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sweeney|first=Mark|title=ESPN buys rugby website|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/aug/21/digitalmedia.sport|accessdate=6 October 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=21 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rugby section on the Spanish-language website [[ESPN Deportes.com]] is also branded ESPN Scrum since May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tryscrum.com.ar/2009/11/espn-deportes-en-alta-definicion/ ESPN, deportes en alta definición] - 18 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In botany, '''Epiblem''' is a tissue that replaces the [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] in most roots and in stems of submerged aquatic plants. It is usually located between the epidermis and [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]] in the root or stem of a plant.

'''Exoticism''' (from 'exotic') is a trend in European art and design, whereby artists became fascinated with ideas and styles from distant regions, and drew inspiration from them. This often involved surrounding foreign cultures with mystique and fantasy which owed more to European culture than to the exotic cultures themselves: this process of glamorisation and stereotyping is called 'exoticization'.

==History of exoticism==

First stimulated by Eastern trade in the 16th and 17th centuries, interest in non-western (particularly "Oriental", i.e. Middle Eastern or Asian) art by Europeans became more and more popular following [[European colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oshinsky|first=Sara J.|title=Exoticism in the Decorative Arts|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/exot/hd_exot.htm|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influences of Exoticism can be seen through numerous genres of this period, notably in music, painting, and decorative art. In music, exoticism is a genre in which the rhythms, melodies, or instrumentation are designed to evoke the atmosphere of far-off lands or ancient times (e.g. [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel's]] ''[[Daphnis et Chloé]]'' and ''Tzigane for Violin and Orchestra'',  [[Claude Debussy|Debussy's]] ''Syrinx for Flute Solo'' or [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov's]] ''[[Capriccio espagnol]]''). Like orientalist subjects in 19th-century painting, exoticism in the decorative arts and interior decoration was associated with fantasies of opulence.

Exoticism, by one definition, is "the charm of the unfamiliar". Scholar [[Alden Jones]] defines exoticism in art and literature as the representation of one culture for consumption by another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmartset.com/article/article08060708.aspx|title=This Is Not a Cruise|author=Alden Jones|date=August 6, 2007|publisher=The Smart Set}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Segalen's important "Essay on Exoticism" reveals Exoticism as born of the age of imperialism, possessing both aesthetic and ontological value, while using it to uncover a significant cultural "otherness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Segalen|first=Victor|title=Essay on Exoticism: An Aesthetics of Diversity|year=2002|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important and archetypical exoticist is the artist and writer [[Paul Gauguin]], whose visual representations of [[Tahiti]]an people and landscapes were targeted at a French audience. While exoticism is closely linked to [[Orientalism]], it is not a movement necessarily associated with a particular time period or culture. Exoticism may take the form of [[primitivism]], [[ethnocentrism]], or humanism.

Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (29 August 1780 – 14 January 1867) was a French Neoclassical painter. The revival of ancient Greek and Roman art left behind the Academy’s emphasis on naturalism, and incorporated a new found idealism not seen since the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herbert|first=Robert|title=Art, Leisure, and Parisian Society|journal=Art Journal|year=1990|volume=49|issue=1|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As classicism progressed, Ingres identified a newfound idealism and exoticism in his work. The Grand Odalisque, finished in 1814, was created to arouse the male view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carter|first=Karen|title=The Spectatorship of the Affiche Illustrée and the Modern City of Paris, 1880-1900|journal=Journal of Design History|year=2012|volume=25|issue=1|page=24|doi=10.1093/jdh/epr044}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The notion of the exotic figure furthers Ingres’ use of symmetry and line by enabling the eye to cohesively move across the canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Petra|title=Nineteenth-Century European Art|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Ingres’ intention was to make the woman beautiful in his work, his model was a courtesan, which arouse debate.

Édouard Manet’s [[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]], finished in 1863, was based on Titian’s Venus of Urbino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Petra|title=Nineteenth Century European Art|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Olympia was a popular play about a courtesan called Olympia. This subject was extremely controversial for an artist to portray a woman like this because of traditional vision of the Academy.  Manet was being very different from the accepted academic style by outlining and flattening space that created a distortion of classical elements. Olympia is provocative in her nudity that implies she is naked, not nude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Petra|title=Nineteenth Century European Art|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is looking out in a very confrontational way, and setting the viewer as a man coming to the prostitute, although Olympia’s hand suggests she is not ready to engage with the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Petra|title=Nineteenth Century European Art|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The African servant calls on racism and slavery in France, because showing someone of color participating in French life was unheard of, furthering the work's exotic nature.

The '''Food Industry Centre (FIC)''' at [[Cardiff Metropolitan University]] (also known as UWIC) is a [[Wales|Welsh]] research and education organisation designed to address issues of food safety and food-related health concerns. Its mission also includes supporting the Welsh food industry. The centre, which is part of UWIC’s Cardiff School of Health Sciences at the university's [[Llandaff]] campus, was launched in 1999. A new facility for the centre opened on 21 April 2009 and was built at a cost of £5,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =Moira Sharkey | title =Food industry centre part of £46m Uwic revamp | publisher = South Wales Echo/Wales Online | date =26 January 2008 | url =http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/education-news/2008/01/26/food-industry-centre-part-of-46m-uwic-revamp-91466-20398119/ | accessdate=2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = | title =New facility to boost Welsh food industry

'''Grimsby Institute and University Centre Grimsby''' (often '''Grimsby Institute''' or '''GIFHE''', formerly '''Grimsby Institute of Further &amp; Higher Education''' and '''Grimsby College''') is a [[further education|further]] and higher education University Centre in [[North East Lincolnshire]], England.

==History==

===Grimsby College of Further Education===
It was known as Grimsby Technical College in the 1950s, administered by the County Borough of Grimsby Education Committee, becoming Grimsby College of Further Education in the 1960s, offering three-year [[Higher National Diploma|HNDs]] (a higher education qualification) in [[food science]], and also applied chemistry. It was based at Nuns Corner. The food science course involved six months of teaching and six months in industry per year. In 1966 it became Grimsby College of Technology, and was heavily involved with training people for food science careers; which was of considerable importance to the economy of Grimsby.

===Grimsby College of Technology===
By 1967 it was also offering HNDs in Refrigeration Engineering, Analytical Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. Refrigeration was taught on a site on Weelsby Street. It also offered courses in training for the [[British Merchant Navy]]. It hosted food science conferences. By 1968 it was also offering HNDs in Business Studies and Mechanical Engineering (refrigeration or environmental). Its departments included:
* Food and Fashion
* Science and Mathematics
* Engineering
* Management and Business Studies.
* School of Art
* Maritime Studies and Fisheries
* Building
* General Studies (the humanities)
* Grimsby School of Nursing

By the early 1970s it was offering four HNDs – Business, [[Refrigeration]] Engineering, Food Technology, and Food Science (Applied Chemistry). Its [[Higher National Certificate|HNC]] courses also were food or chemical industry based, to train technicians. By 1972 it had a department of Science and Food Technology, as well as Food and Fashion (which looked at catering qualifications, not the chemistry involved). In 1973 it was offering an Applied Biology HND (with options of Nutrition and Biochemistry). In April 1974 administration transferred to Humberside Education Committee, and more HNDs (briefly) included Data Processing and Marketing and Advertising.

By 1989 more arts courses were being offered than science, so the college name became '''Grimsby College of Technology &amp; Arts''' (GCTA), then just '''Grimsby College''' in 1993. In 2004 in its 60th anniversary year, it became Grimsby Institute.

===Connections with Humberside University===
By September 1982 it was offering its same set of four food-industry-related HND through Hull College of HE on Inglemore Avenue in Hull. On 1 January 1983, the Humberside College of HE came into existence, through integrating Grimsby's HND courses with the Hull College of HE. At this point, it was becoming a full-fledged HE college. On 11 June 1990, the HE College, at Hull, became Humberside Polytechnic. Three of its thirteen sites were in Grimsby (its food and fisheries site), one being the College of Technology's food-industry-related HE courses. The plan was to reduce the number of sites to four by the mid-1990s: three in Hull and one in Grimsby. The grand plans and vision for expansion of the polytechnic extended as far as [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], [[York]] and [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]]. This would almost actually happen: except (conversely) Lincoln would be the centre, extending as far north as Hull; Grimsby would be jettisoned.

The former Humberside Polytechnic, which became the University of Humberside in 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yorkshire Universities |url=http://www.yorkshireuniversities.ac.uk/about/members/university-of-lincoln.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121223110310/http://www.yorkshireuniversities.ac.uk/about/members/university-of-lincoln.html |archivedate=23 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (and essentially closed down in Hull when it became the [[University of Lincoln]] in 2002), had its Food, Fisheries and Environmental Studies site adjacent to Grimsby College on Bargate, which became the School of Applied Science and Technology with around 500 students. It offered BSc courses in [[Food Science]]. It offered a similar range of courses to that of the University of Lincoln's current [[Holbeach Technology Park|site]] in [[Holbeach]].

[[File:Yeast on grapes.jpg|thumb|140px|left|In the 1990s it offered HNDs in wine-making (oenology)]]
Grimsby College, as it was known from 1993, was known as an 'Associate College' of the University of Humberside, and offered a wide range of HNDs, not its former range of food-industry courses, although it even offered an HND in [[Viticulture]] and [[Winemaking|Vinification]], which became the UK's first degree course in [[Oenology]] (wine-making) in 1994, run by Mike Grubb. It offered a Sports Science HND through [[Nottingham Trent University]]. The type of degree courses it offered were social science, business, humanities, and marketing &amp; tourism. The former food department was not part of the college.

In 1999 it began to offer Broadcast Journalism and Media Production courses, and in 2000 it branched out to ECE Television, which became [[East Coast Media]], which worked with GTV (owned by [[Granada Television|Granada]]).

In 2015, The Media Production Course was renamed from East Coast Media to Estuary Student TV. This was to reflect on the [[Estuary TV]] brand which is the Local Television Channel owned by the Grimsby Institute. &lt;ref&gt; {{ cite web |title=Estuary Student TV
|url=http://estuarystudent.tv}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Higher education college===
In 2004 it became the '''Grimsby Institute of Further &amp; Higher Education'''. Its connection (associate college status) with the former University of Lincolnshire and Humberside (formed in 1996) finished when this changed its name to the [[University of Lincoln]] in 2002, which rapidly closed most of its main Hull site down (now occupied by the [[Hull York Medical School]]), concentrating it all in Lincoln. Grimsby Institute was now separate from any partner university.

In 2006 it sponsored the Pyewipe roundabout on the [[A180 road (England)|A180]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/humber/4585014.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - England - Humber - A roundabout way of advertising|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Humber Food School was moved from Grimsby to Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=145102&amp;sectioncode=26|title=Humberside staff call for v-c to quit|work=Times Higher Education (THE)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Food Refrigeration and Process Engineering Research Centre (FRPERC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grimsby.ac.uk/index.php?category=491|title=Grimsby Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; moved to the College in August 2009. Ray Ellis took over as acting principal from Professor Daniel Khan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nelincs.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/councillors--democracy-and-elections/councillors-information-and-advice/cllr-daniel-khan/|title=North East Lincolnshire Council|author=System|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420083032/http://www.nelincs.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/councillors--democracy-and-elections/councillors-information-and-advice/cllr-daniel-khan/|archivedate=20 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; OBE in February 2010, who had been there for nine years. In July 2010 the Institute announced that Sue Middlehurst had accepted the post of Principal.

==Structure==
It is situated at the junction of the [[A1243 road|A1243]] and [[A46 road|A46]], just north of the [[Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital]].

===Main campus===
The Institute's main campus is at Nuns Corner in [[Grimsby]], and it has 12 branch sites. In 2006 the Institute had around 23,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://education.independent.co.uk/higher/az_uni_colleges/article1208563.ece| title = A-Z Unis and Colleges: Grimsby Institute of Further &amp; Higher Education| accessdate = 29 January 2007| last = Tarleton| first = Alice | date = 1 August 2006| work = The Independent Online Edition| publisher = Independent News and Media Limited |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060926004506/http://education.independent.co.uk/higher/az_uni_colleges/article1208563.ece  |archivedate = 26 September 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site has its own nursery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grimsby.ac.uk/littlestars,|title=Page not found!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fitness suite&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grimsby.ac.uk/GIFHE-Life/Facilities/Bargate-Fitness-Suite|title=Page not found!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Higher education==
The Institute's higher education [[academic degree|degrees]] are validated by [[Teesside University]], [[University of Hull|Hull]], [[Sheffield Hallam University|Sheffield Hallam]], [[Leeds Metropolitan University|Leeds Metropolitan]], and [[University of Huddersfield|Huddersfield]] universities.

Graduation ceremonies are held in October.

==College future==
The College has plans to achieve University status in the future, possibly to replace what the Humberside Polytechnic formerly offered in the Humber region.

A£16&amp;nbsp;million university centre opened in 2011. Construction work began on 15 February 2010. Due to a Scarborough further education college's financial problems caused by its small size, the [[Yorkshire Coast College]] merged with the Grimsby Institute on 1 January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2009/uksi_20093237_en_1 2010 Merger]&lt;/ref&gt; Merger proposals were first announced in October 2008. Both colleges are administered by the Yorkshire &amp; Humber [[Learning and Skills Council|LSC]] based in [[Bradford]].

===Seafood institute===
A new Humber Seafood Institute opened in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grimsby.ac.uk/category/311.html |title=Page not found! |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222001716/http://www.grimsby.ac.uk/category/311.html |archivedate=22 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Sea Fish Industry Authority]] (Seafish) moved to the new site.

 {{main|Harold Adams Innis}}
'''[[Harold Innis|Harold Adams Innis]]''' (November 5, 1894 – November 8, 1952) was a professor of [[political economy]] at the [[University of Toronto]] and the author of seminal works on Canadian economic history and on media and [[communication theory]]. He helped develop the [[staples thesis]], which holds that Canada's culture, political history and economy have been decisively influenced by the exploitation and export of a series of staples such as fur, fish, wood, wheat, mined metals and fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;Easterbrook, W.T. and Watkins, M.H. (1984) "The Staple Approach." In ''Approaches to Canadian Economic History.'' Ottawa: Carleton Library Series, Carleton University Press, pp. 1–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis's communications writings explore the role of media in shaping the culture and development of civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Babe, Robert E. (2000) "The Communication Thought of Harold Adams Innis." In ''Canadian Communication Thought: Ten Foundational Writers''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 51–88.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued, for example, that a balance between oral and written forms of communication contributed to the flourishing of Greek civilization in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, Paul. (2003) ''Harold Innis''. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers Inc., p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; But he warned that [[Western culture|Western civilization]] is now imperiled by powerful, advertising-driven media obsessed by "present-mindedness" and the "continuous, systematic, ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1952) ''Changing Concepts of Time''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communications theories==
===Time and space===

{{quote|Improvements in communication...make for increased difficulties of understanding.|Harold Innis|''The Bias of Communication''&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1951) ''The Bias of Communication''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p. 28. &lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of Harold Innis's primary contributions to the field of communications was to apply the dimensions of time and space to various media. He divided media into time-biased and space-biased  types. Time-biased media include [[clay tablet|clay]] or [[stele|stone tablet]]s, [[manuscript|hand-copied manuscripts ]] on [[parchment]] or [[vellum]] and oral sources such as [[Homer|Homer's]] epic poems. These are intended to carry stories and messages that last for many generations, but tend to reach limited audiences. Space-biased media are more ephemeral. They include modern media such as radio, television, and mass circulation newspapers that convey information to many people over long distances, but have short exposure times. While time-biased media favour stability, community, tradition and religion, space-biased media facilitate rapid change, materialism, secularism and empire. Innis elaborated on his distinctions between time-biased and space-biased media in ''[[Empire and Communications]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The concepts of time and space reflect the significance of media to civilization. Media that emphasize time are those durable in character such as parchment, clay and stone. The heavy materials are suited to the development of architecture and sculpture. Media that emphasize space are apt to be less durable and light in character such as papyrus and paper. The latter are suited to wide areas in administration and trade. The conquest of Egypt by Rome gave access to supplies of papyrus, which became the basis of a large administrative empire. Materials that emphasize time favour decentralization and hierarchical types of institutions, while those that emphasize space favour centralization and systems of government less hierarchical in character.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1950) ''Empire and Communications''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:Fur traders in canada 1777.jpg|right|thumb|The encounter of European traders from a space-bound print culture with aboriginal hunters from a time-bound oral culture. Innovation meets tradition with disastrous, long-term results.]]

Societies that depend solely on time-biased media are oral and tribal. Although leadership tends to be hierarchical, time-bound societies may also operate by consensus. Since, in their purest form, time-bound cultures do not rely on written records, they must preserve their traditions in story, song and myth handed down unchanged from one generation to the next. For them memory is of crucial importance; they revere the wisdom of elders and favour concrete over abstract forms of thought. On the other hand, societies that depend on space-biased media such as printed newspapers and books tend to favour abstract thought and control over space. They have little regard for tradition and when compared with oral societies, their ways of thinking are apt to be  more rational, linear and impersonal.&lt;ref&gt;See Babe, pp.72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The encounter of European traders from the imperial centres of France and Britain with the aboriginal tribes of North America that Innis chronicled in ''The Fur Trade in Canada'' is a poignant example of what can happen when two different civilizations meet --- one traditional and oriented to preserving its tribal culture in time and the other bent on spreading its influence over long distances. European guns used in war and conquest, for example, enabled the indigenous peoples to hunt more efficiently, but led to the rapid destruction of their food supply and of the beaver they depended on to obtain European goods. Conflicts over hunting territories led to warfare, made more deadly by European bullets.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Alexander, John. (2006). ''Marginal Man: The Dark Vision of Harold Innis''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp.150–153. "The apocalypse of culture disorientation that Innis would come to believe followed the introduction of writing and printing, and still later followed the application of power to print reproduction, has its prototype in the collapse of the traditional Indian civilization after the introduction of iron trade goods."&lt;/ref&gt; And all this, Innis argued, disturbed the balance that "...had grown up previous to the coming of the European."&lt;ref&gt; Innis (Fur Trade) pp.388–389.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balance, bias and empire===

Harold Innis examined the rise and fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing the effects of communications media. He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show that media 'biases' toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. These interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain the empire, and the power (or force) required to expand and defend it. Innis wrote that the interplay between knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire: "The sword and pen worked together. Power was increased by concentration in a few hands, specialization of function was enforced, and scribes with leisure to keep and study records contributed to the advancement of knowledge and thought. The written record, signed, sealed and swiftly transmitted was essential to military power and the extension of government."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Empire and Communications) pp.10–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis warned however, that such generalizations tended to obscure the differences between empires. So, he embarked on specific studies of the civilizations of [[ancient Egypt]], [[Babylonia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]; as well as of the effects of the oral tradition on [[Ancient Greece|Greek civilization]] and the written tradition on the [[Roman Empire]]. His reflections appear in separate chapters in his book ''Empire and Communications'' along with additional chapters on the combined effects of parchment and paper in the [[Middle Ages]], and paper and the printing press in the development of modern societies.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, p.52: Heyer writes that ''Empire and Communications'' received few reviews and they ranged from "lukewarm to negative". Yet, many now see it as a Canadian classic because it "has sufficient detail in its analysis and originality to be regarded as a landmark book."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Plato Symposium papyrus.jpg|thumb|left|A papyrus copy of Plato's [[Symposium (Plato)|''Symposium'']]. Using the flexible Greek alphabet, Plato preserved the power of spoken dialogue in written prose. Innis thought this balancing of time and space-oriented media contributed to the cultural and intellectual vitality of ancient Greece.]]

Biographer John Watson warns against the tendency to apply Innis's concept of media 'bias' in a mechanical or deterministic way. He writes that Innis "emphasizes, in dealing with ''concrete historical cases'', the necessity of a balance of ''various media'' whose predispositions [or biases] complement each other to make for a successful imperial project." Watson points out that for Innis, balance was crucial in sustaining an empire. Innis examined each empire to discover how time-binding and space-binding media contributed to the necessary balance between power and knowledge and among ruling groups – religious, political and military.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp.312–319.&lt;/ref&gt; As Innis himself wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Concentration on a medium of communication implies a bias in the cultural development of the civilization concerned either towards an emphasis on space and political organization or towards an emphasis on time and religious organization. Introduction of a second medium tends to check the bias of the first and to create conditions suited to the growth of empire. The [[Byzantine empire]] emerged from a fusion of a bias incidental to [[papyrus]] in relation to political organization and of [[parchment]] in relation to ecclesiastical organization.&lt;ref&gt; Innis, (''Empire and Communications''). p.216.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Innis argued that a balance between the spoken word and writing contributed to the flourishing of ancient Greece in the time of [[Plato]]. Plato conveyed his ideas by recording the conversations of [[Socrates]]. His philosophy thus preserved "the power of the spoken word on the written page." Plato's method of using poetic dialogues cast in prose enabled him to arrive at new philosophical positions.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, pp.68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; This balance between the time-biased medium of speech and the space-biased medium of writing was eventually upset, Innis argued, as the oral tradition gave way to the dominance of writing. The torch of empire then passed from Greece to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, pp.99–100. See also, Heyer, pp.49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monopolies of knowledge===

In his 1947 presidential address to the [[Royal Society of Canada]], Innis remarked: "I have attempted to suggest that Western civilization has been profoundly influenced by communication and that marked changes in communications have had important implications." He went on to mention the evolution of communications media from the [[cuneiform]] script inscribed on clay tablets in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] to the advent of radio in the 20th century. "In each period I have attempted to trace the implications of the media of communication for the character of knowledge and to suggest that a monopoly or oligopoly of knowledge is built up to the point that equilibrium is disturbed."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1951) ''The Bias of Communication.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp.3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis argued, for example, that a "complex system of writing" such as cuneiform script resulted in the growth of a "special class" of scribes.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Bias) p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The long training required to master such writing ensured that relatively few people would belong to this privileged and aristocratic class. As Paul Heyer explains:
[[Image:SphinxGiza.jpg|thumb|right|The Sphinx and the Great Pyramid at Giza. Innis wrote that the monarchs who built the pyramids had to relinquish their absolute power when papyrus replaced stone as the dominant medium of communication.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the beginning, which for Innis means Mesopotamia, there was clay, the reed stylus used to write on it, and the wedge-shaped cuneiform script. Thus did civilization arise, along with an elite group of scribe priests who eventually codified laws. Egypt followed suit, using papyrus, the brush, and hieroglyphic writing.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In ''[[Empire and Communications]]'', Innis wrote that the ebb and flow of Egypt's ancient empire partly reflected weaknesses or limitations imposed by "the inflexibility of religious institutions supported by a monopoly over a complex system of writing":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Writing was a difficult and specialized art requiring long apprenticeship, and reading implied a long period of instruction. The god of writing was closely related to the leading deities and reflected the power of the scribe over religion. The scribe had the full qualifications of a special profession and was included in the upper classes of kings, priests, nobles and generals, in contrast with peasants, fishermen, artisans and labourers. Complexity favoured increasing control under a monopoly of priests and the confinement of knowledge to special classes.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Empire) p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Innis argued that this priestly or scribal monopoly disturbed the necessary balance between the religious bias toward time and continuity, and the political bias toward space and power. "A successful empire," he wrote, "required adequate appreciation of the problems of space, which were in part military and political, and of problems of time, which were in part dynastic and biological and in part religious." He ended his essay on ancient Egypt by pointing to the imbalance that arose because the priestly monopoly over writing and knowledge supported an emphasis on time and religion, but neglected the political problems inherent in ruling over an empire extended in space.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Empire) p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Harold Innis, monopolies of knowledge eventually face challenges to their power, especially with the arrival of new media. He pointed for example, to the monasteries that spread throughout Europe after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]]. Their monopoly of knowledge depended on their control over the production of the time-binding medium of parchment useful for preserving hand-copied manuscripts written in Latin. Power was vested therefore, in a scribal and literate, religious elite. The largely illiterate laity depended on priests to interpret the scriptures and on image-driven media such as paintings and statues that depicted the central figures in Biblical stories.

[[Image:Chaucer_Hoccleve.png|thumb|left|280px|[[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (c. 1343 – 1400). Innis pointed out that Chaucer wrote in vernacular English instead of Latin or Norman French hastening the growth of English nationalism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Portrait of Chaucer by [[Thomas Hoccleve]].&lt;/sub&gt;]]

But the space-binding medium of paper imported from China, Innis wrote, facilitated challenges from Islam and later from a rising commercial class. "Paper supported the growth of trade and cities and of education beyond the control of the monasteries, and in turn of the Church and the cathedrals."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Empire) pp.165–166.&lt;/ref&gt; Paper also supported the rise of vernacular languages reducing Latin's cultural sway.

Innis wrote that the Catholic Church fought to preserve its time-oriented monopoly of knowledge with the [[Inquisition]], but eventually paper achieved even greater power with the invention of the [[printing press]] around the middle of the 15th century. Now, the balance shifted decisively in favour of space over time. The [[Protestant Reformation]] followed, along with European exploration and empire, the rise of science and the evolution of the nation-state. Characteristically, Innis summarizes the far-reaching implications of the new medium of paper in a single paragraph that starts with the Middle Ages and ends with the modern United States:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The dominance of parchment in the West gave a bias toward ecclesiastical organization, which led to the introduction of paper, with its bias toward political organization. With printing, paper facilitated an effective development of the vernaculars and gave expression to their vitality in the growth of nationalism. The adaptability of the alphabet to large-scale machine industry became the basis of literacy, advertising and trade. The book as a specialized product of printing and, in turn, the newspaper strengthened the position of language as a basis of nationalism. In the United States, the dominance of the newspaper led to large-scale development of monopolies of communication in terms of space and implied a neglect of problems of time.&lt;ref&gt; Innis, (Empire) p.216. Innis traces the histories of parchment, paper and printing in his book's final chapters, pp. 140–217.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Western civilization in peril===

Harold Innis's analysis of the effects of communications on the rise and fall of empires led him, in the end, to warn grimly that Western civilization was now facing its own profound crisis. The development of "mechanized" communications media such as mass-circulation newspapers had shifted the balance decisively in favour of space and power, over time, continuity and knowledge. Industrial societies cut time into precise fragments suitable to engineers and accountants&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Bias), p.140.&lt;/ref&gt; and Western civilization suffered from an "obsession with present-mindedness" that eliminated concerns about past or future.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), p.87&lt;/ref&gt; Communications media that transmit information quickly over long distances had upset the balance required for cultural survival. "The overwhelming pressure of mechanization evident in the newspaper and the magazine," Innis wrote, "has led to the creation of vast monopolies of communication. Their entrenched positions involve a continuous, systematic, ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity. The emphasis on change is the only permanent characteristic."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1952) ''Changing Concepts of Time''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Valiant Shield - B2 Stealth bomber from Missouri leads ariel formation.jpg|thumb|A B-2 Stealth Bomber leads an aerial flight formation during exercise [[Valiant Shield]] in 2006. Innis believed that advanced U.S. military technologies reinforced the American obsession with space, empire and force at the expense of time, tradition and knowledge.]]

The crisis facing the West was worsened, Innis argued, because communications monopolies that ran the media were largely immune from outside challenge. They literally spoke the language of the masses, effectively penetrating popular consciousness and shaping public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p.385.&lt;/ref&gt; American media, with their dependence on advertising and therefore mass appeal, were extremely effective at mobilizing large audiences. Not only were Americans exhorted to buy the newest "improved" products, they were also exposed to a barrage of propaganda from political elites. [[Theodore Roosevelt]] mastered the newspaper as a communications device, just as his fifth cousin, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] mastered radio.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias) p.81&lt;/ref&gt; The news media were also influenced by a large [[public relations]] industry that shaped public opinion on behalf of powerful interests.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Changing Concepts), pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis believed that the overwhelming spatial bias of modern media was heightened in the United States by the development of powerful military technologies, including atomic weapons. The advent of the [[Cold War]] led to such an emphasis on military preparedness that the U.S. was placed on a permanent war footing, its economy increasingly dependent on the manufacture of weapons. As Canadian scholar Arthur Kroker writes, "Innis's political lesson was clear: the United States was now a fully 'space-oriented' society, with no inner coordinating principle and with no organic conception of 'lived tradition,' time, succession or duration which might act as an inner check against the politics of imperialism."&lt;ref&gt;Kroker, Arthur. (1984). ''Technology and the Canadian Mind: Innis/McLuhan/Grant''. Montreal: New World Perspectives, p.123.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Biographer John Watson writes that "the United States represents to Innis something akin to cultural apocalypse."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p.386.&lt;/ref&gt; In an essay entitled, "Technology and Public Opinion in U.S.A," Innis concluded that the United States depended on a foreign policy shaped by military power. "Dependence on organized power and a traditional antipathy to coloured peoples weakens political sensitivity, and lack of experience with problems of continuity and empire threatens the Western world with uncertainty and war."&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), p.189.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis was among the first to suggest that the U.S. had lost the balance between power and knowledge essential to its long-term survival.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp.381 and 387.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Western civilization could only be saved, Innis argued, by recovering the balance between space and time. For him, that meant reinvigorating the oral tradition within universities while freeing institutions of higher learning from political and commercial pressures. In his essay, ''A Plea for Time'', he suggested that genuine dialogue within universities could produce the critical thinking necessary to restore the balance between power and knowledge. Then, universities could muster the courage to attack the monopolies that always imperil civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias) ''A Plea for Time'', pp.61–91. The comment about universities mustering their courage appears in "The upside of ivory towers" by Rick Salutin. ''Globe and Mail'', Sept. 7/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of Innis's theories==

Influenced by Innis's communications theories, historian [[Marshall Poe]] proposed a theory on the genesis of new media. He proposed that new media are "pulled" into existence by organized interests after inventors have already developed the technology, or prototypes of the technology, necessary to support the media.  Poe's theory also predicts the effects the media will have on society by considering eight attributes of a medium: accessibility, privacy, fidelity, volume, velocity, range, persistence, and searchability.&lt;ref name="Poe, A History of Communications"&gt;{{cite book|last=Poe|first=Marshall|title=A History of Communication: Media and Society from the Evolution of Speech to the Internet|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-17944-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marshall McLuhan]], Canadian philosopher, [[public intellectual]] and former colleague of Innis at the [[University of Toronto]], also acknowledged Innis's impact on McLuhan's own works, including "The Gutenberg Galaxy", and "Understanding Media".{{cn|date=March 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2026">In computer graphics programming, '''hit-testing''' ('''hit detection''', '''picking''', or '''pick correlation''' &lt;ref name="Foley"/&gt;) is the process of determining whether a user-controlled cursor (such as a mouse cursor or touch-point on a touch-screen interface) intersects a given graphical object (such as a shape, line, or curve) drawn on the screen. Hit-testing may be performed on the movement or activation of a mouse or other pointing device.

Hit-testing is used by [[GUI]] environments to respond to user actions, such as selecting a menu item or a target in a game based on its visual location. In Web programming languages such as [[HTML]], [[SVG]], and [[CSS]], this is associated with the concept of pointer-events (e.g. user-initiated cursor movement or object selection).

[[Collision detection]] is a related concept for detecting intersections of two or more different graphical objects, rather than intersection of a cursor with one or more graphical objects.

There are many different algorithms that may be used to perform hit-testing, with different performance or accuracy outcomes. One common hit-test algorithm is presented in the pseudo-code below:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c"&gt;
function HitTest(Rectangle r1, Rectangle r2) returns boolean
{
    return ((r1.X + r1.Width &gt;= r2.X) and (r1.X &lt;= r2.X + r2.Width) and (r1.Y + r1.Height &gt;= r2.Y) and (r1.Y &lt;= r2.Y + r2.Height));
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The '''Human Race Machine''' (HRM) is a [[computer graphics|computerized]] [[System console|console]] composed of four different programs. The Human Race Machine program allows participants to see themselves with the facial characteristics of six different [[racial group|races]]: [[Asian people|Asian]], [[White people|White]], [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], [[Middle Eastern]], and [[India]]n, mapped onto their own face.  The Age Machine allows viewers see an aged version of his or her face. A version of this methodology has been used for over twenty years by the [[FBI]] and the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] to help locate kidnap victims and missing children. The Couples Machine combines photographs of two people in different percentages to show the appearance of their child. The Anomaly Machine lets viewers see themselves with facial anomalies. The HRM was created by [[artist]] [[Nancy Burson]] and David Kramlich; it uses [[morphing]] technology.  It was shown on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]] on 2006-02-16.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2386">In [[astronomy]], the '''Kennicutt–Schmidt law''' (or simply '''Schmidt law''') is an empirical relation between the gas density and star formation rate (SFR) in a given region.  The relation was first examined by [[Maarten Schmidt]] in a 1959 paper where he proposed that the SFR surface density scales as some positive power &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of the local gas surface density.&lt;ref name="schmidt59" /&gt; i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{SFR} \propto (\Sigma_{gas})^n&lt;/math&gt;.
In general, the SFR surface density &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma_{SFR})&lt;/math&gt; is in units of solar masses per year per square parsec &lt;math&gt;(M_\odot  ~\textrm{ yr}^{-1} \textrm{ pc}^{-2})&lt;/math&gt; and the gas surface density in grams per square parsec &lt;math&gt;(\textrm{g}~\textrm{pc}^{-2})&lt;/math&gt;.  Using an analysis of gaseous helium and young stars in the solar neighborhood, the local density of [[white dwarfs]] and their [[luminosity function]], and the local helium density, Schmidt suggested a value of &lt;math&gt;n \approx 2&lt;/math&gt; (and very likely between 1 and 3). All of the data used were gathered from the Milky Way, and specifically the solar-neighborhood.

In 1989, [[Robert Kennicutt]] found that the H&lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt; intensities of every galaxy in a sample of 7 could be fit with the Schmidt law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Binney|first1=James|last2=Merrifield|first2=Michael|title=Galactic Astronomy|date=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-691-02565-0|pages=524|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, he examined the connection between gas density and SFR for nearly 100 nearby galaxies to estimate a value of &lt;math&gt;n = 1.4 \pm 0.15&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="kennicutt98" /&gt;

{{Social teachings of the popes}}
'''''Laudato si{{'}}''''' (Medieval Central [[Italian language|Italian]] for "Praise Be to You") is the second [[encyclical]] of [[Pope Francis]]. The encyclical has the subtitle "On care for our common home".&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText" /&gt; In it, the Pope critiques [[consumerism]] and [[overdevelopment|irresponsible development]], laments [[environmental degradation]] and [[global warming]], and calls all people of the world to take "swift and unified global action."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

The encyclical, dated 24 May 2015, was officially published at noon on 18 June 2015, accompanied by a news conference.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; The Vatican released the document in Italian, German, English, Spanish, French, Polish, Portuguese and Arabic, alongside the original Latin.&lt;ref name=strong /&gt;

The encyclical is the second published by Francis, after ''[[Lumen fidei]]'' ("The Light of Faith"), which was released in 2013. Since ''Lumen fidei'' was largely the work of Francis's predecessor [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]], ''Laudato si{{'}}'' is generally viewed as the first encyclical that is entirely the work of Francis.&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt;&lt;ref name=things /&gt;

== Content ==
[[File:John Zizioulas presents the encyclical Laudato si' at the press conference in Rome.webm|thumb| [[w:John Zizioulas|John Zizioulas]],  [[w:Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]]  [[w:Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[w:Pergamon|Pergamon]], presents the encyclical ''Laudato si''' at the [[b:Development Cooperation Handbook/Interviews/Press Conference Presentation Laudato si'|Press conference]] in Rome ]]
The title of the social encyclical is an [[Central Italian|Umbrian]] phrase&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt; from Saint [[Francis of Assisi]]'s 13th-century "[[Canticle of the Sun]]" (also called the Canticle of the Creatures), a poem and prayer in which God is praised for the creation of the different creatures and aspects of the Earth.&lt;ref name=bulletin /&gt;

The tone of the Pope's phrasing has been described as "cautious and undogmatic, and he specifically calls for discussion and dialogue."&lt;ref name=good/&gt;  For example, he states in the encyclical (#188):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There are certain environmental issues where it is not easy to achieve a broad consensus. Here I would state once more that the Church does not presume to settle scientific questions or to replace politics. But I am concerned to encourage an honest and open debate so that particular interests or ideologies will not prejudice the common good.&lt;ref name=good/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He adds that "Although the post-industrial period may well be remembered as one of the most irresponsible in history, nonetheless there is reason to hope that humanity at the dawn of the twenty-first century will be remembered for having generously shouldered its grave responsibilities."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  Francis does state that concern for the natural world is no longer "'optional' but is an integral part of the Church teaching on social justice."&lt;ref name=visitor/&gt;

Francis reportedly has said that the encyclical was not really an environmental document at all.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;  The warming of the planet is a symptom of a greater problem: the developed world's indifference to the destruction of the planet as they pursue short-term economic gains.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;  This has resulted in a "[[throwaway culture]]" in which unwanted items and unwanted people, such as the unborn, the elderly, and the poor, are discarded as waste.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;&lt;ref name=return/&gt;  This subtext makes the document "more profoundly subversive" than it appears on the surface.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;

The real problem, according to Francis, lies in the fact that humans no longer see God as the [[Creator deity#Christianity|Creator]].&lt;ref name=return/&gt;  Thus we see "other living beings as mere objects subjected to arbitrary human domination" and do not realize that "the ultimate purpose of other creatures is not found in us."&lt;ref name=return/&gt; Francis says that instead of viewing humanity as having "dominion" over the earth, we must see that everything is interconnected and that all of creation is a "kind of universal family".&lt;ref name=visitor/&gt; Nature cannot be seen as something apart from humanity, or merely the place where we live.&lt;ref name=visitor/&gt; He says that our social and environmental crises are thus one complex crisis that must be solved holistically.&lt;ref name=visitor/&gt;

===Environmentalism===
Francis "pulls no punches" when lamenting pollution, [[global warming|climate change]], a lack of clean water, loss of biodiversity, and an overall decline in human life and a breakdown of society.&lt;ref name=visitor/&gt; "Never have we so hurt and mistreated our common home as we have in the last two hundred years," he states.&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

He "describe[s] a relentless [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]] and [[Environmental degradation|destruction]] of the environment, for which he blamed apathy, the reckless pursuit of profits, excessive faith in technology and political shortsightedness."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; ''Laudato si''' "unambiguously accepts the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus]] that [[global warming|changes in the climate]] are largely man-made"&lt;ref name=eco /&gt; and states that "climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of goods. It represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day" and warns of "unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequence for all of us" if prompt [[climate change mitigation]] efforts are not undertaken.&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

The encyclical highlights the role of [[fossil fuel]]s in causing climate change. "We know that technology based on the use of highly polluting fossil fuels – especially coal, but also oil and, to a lesser degree, gas – needs to be progressively replaced without delay," Francis says. "Until greater progress is made in developing widely accessible sources of renewable energy, it is legitimate to choose the less harmful alternative or to find short-term solutions."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  The encyclical's comments on climate change are consistent with the [[scientific consensus on climate change]].&lt;ref name="GillisScience" /&gt;

===Poverty===
The encyclical states that [[developed nation]]s are morally obligated to assist [[developing nation]]s in combating the climate-change crisis.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Poor nations, the pontiff says, are ill-prepared to [[Adaptation to global warming|adapt to the effects of climate change]] and will bear the brunt of its [[Effects of global warming|effects]].&lt;ref name=eco /&gt;  Linking the issues of [[poverty]], which has been a major issue in his papacy, and the environment, he insists that the world must "hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor."&lt;ref name=eco /&gt;

He does not believe, according to [[R. R. Reno]], that "for all our flaws, Western societies are more democratic, more egalitarian, and more inclusive than any in history."&lt;ref name=return/&gt;  Citing the New Zealand Bishops Conference ''Statement on Environmental Issues'', Francis asks "what the commandment 'Thou shall not kill' means when 'twenty percent of the world's population consumes resources at a rate that robs the poor nations and future generations of what they need to survive.'"&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

===Science and modernism===
"Science and religion, with their distinctive approaches to understanding reality, can enter into an intense dialogue fruitful for both," according to the pontiff.&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  Religions, including Christianity, can make "rich contributions ... towards an integral ecology and the full development of humanity,"&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  However, "the scientific and experimental method" itself can be part of the problem when it decouples creation from the Creator.&lt;ref name=return/&gt;

The editor of ''[[First Things]]'' R. R. Reno critiques the encyclical, writing ''Laudato si''' makes "many fierce denunciations of the current global order." This global order "destroys the environment, oppresses the multitudes, and makes us blind to the beauty of creation."&lt;ref name=return/&gt; According to Reno, the critiques of the scientific and technocratic present contained in the encyclical make this "perhaps the most anti-modern encyclical since the [[Syllabus of Errors]], [[Pope Pius IX|Pius IX's]] haughty 1864 dismissal of the conceits of the modern era."&lt;ref name=return/&gt;  He adds that the encyclical's tone lacks elements commonly found in the works of John Paul II and Benedict XVI that, in the tradition of [[Gaudium et Spes]], would have affirmed the modern world while correcting its errors.&lt;ref name=return/&gt;

===Technology===
Modern technology, the "dominant technological paradigm", is seen as a key contributor to the environmental crisis and human suffering. "The technological paradigm has become so dominant that it would be difficult to do without its resources and even more difficult to utilize them without being dominated by their internal logic. It has become countercultural to choose a lifestyle whose goals are even partly independent of technology…  Technology tends to absorb everything into its ironclad logic, and those who are surrounded with technology 'know full well that it moves forward in the final analysis neither for profit nor for the well-being of the human race.'"&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

Technology is not value neutral and technological developments are directed by the profit motive, according to Pope Francis. This is a form of institutionalized greed, generally with little regard for environmental and social consequences. "The economy accepts every advance in technology with a view to profit, without concern for its potentially negative impact on human beings".&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt; The encyclical warns against "blind confidence in technical solutions," particularly in view of the fact that "the specialization which belongs to technology makes it difficult to see the large picture," which "can actually become a form of ignorance."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt; As a result, many technological solutions are nothing more than short-term techno-fixes attempting to remove symptoms rather than addressing the underlying environmental, social, economic, and even moral and spiritual problems: "Technology, which, linked to business interests, is presented as the only way of solving these problems, in fact proves incapable of seeing the mysterious network of relations between things and so sometimes solves one problem only to create others."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

Given these significant short-comings of technology, "scientific and technological progress cannot be equated with progress of humanity and history," and we are deluded by the myth of progress to believe that "ecological problems will solve themselves simply with the application of new technology and without need for ethical consideration or deep change."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  A profound redefinition of progress and "liberation from the dominant technocratic paradigm" are needed, i.e., "we have the freedom needed to limit and direct technology; we can put it at the service of another type of progress, one which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  More fundamentally, according to the pontiff, we need to recognize that "technology severed from ethics will not easily be able to limit its own power," and that "the most extraordinary scientific advances, the most amazing technical abilities, the most astonishing economic growth, unless they are accompanied by authentic social and moral progress, will definitively turn against man."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  Pope Francis adds that the environmental crisis can ultimately only be solved if our immense technological developments are accompanied by a "development in human responsibility, values, and conscience."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

===Other topics===

According to a ''[[New York Times]]'' summary, the encyclical is "sweeping" in scope and is wide-ranging (80 pages/45,000 words), including mentions of such topics as [[urban planning]], [[agricultural economics]], and [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

The encyclical also gives voice to the Pope's opposition to [[abortion]], [[Stem cell controversy#Catholicism|embryonic stem cell research]] and [[population control]] – saying that respect for creation and human dignity go hand in hand.&lt;ref name="CNA" /&gt; "Since everything is interrelated," Francis says, "concern for the protection of nature is also incompatible with the justification of abortion."&lt;ref name="TheIndependent" /&gt; According to the Pope, we can't in fact "genuinely teach the importance of concern for other vulnerable beings, however troublesome or inconvenient they may be, if we fail to protect a human embryo, even when its presence is uncomfortable and creates difficulties."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

''Laudato si''' opposes [[gender theory]] and supports "valuing one's own body in its femininity or masculinity." In acknowledging differences, the Pope states "we can joyfully accept the specific gifts of another man or woman, the work of God the Creator, and find mutual enrichment."&lt;ref name="CNA" /&gt;

===Sources===

The encyclical has 172 footnoted citations,&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText" /&gt; many to Francis's immediate predecessors, [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] and [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; The encyclical also "draws prominently from" [[Bartholomew I of Constantinople]], the patriarch of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Church of Constantinople]] and an ally of the pope.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;  It is highly unusual to quote an Orthodox bishop in a papal document.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;  More than 10% of the footnotes, 21, cite documents from 16 bishops' conferences around the world, mostly from the [[global south]].&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;&lt;ref name=footnote /&gt;  This is the first encyclical to cite bishops' conferences.&lt;ref name=footnote /&gt;  This was an effort, experts believe, to build alliances on a controversial topic.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;  The encyclical also cites Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]]; [[Ali al-Khawas]], a 9th-century [[Islamic mysticism|Sufi mystic]];&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name=mystic /&gt; [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]; and [[Romano Guardini]].&lt;ref name=Faggioli /&gt;

== History ==

=== Early stages ===
Speculation about an "environmental encyclical" to be issued by Pope Francis first began in November 2013.&lt;ref name="RoeweProgress" /&gt; On 24 January 2014, the Vatican confirmed that drafting had begun. The Rev. [[Federico Lombardi]], the [[Holy See Press Office]] director, said that the document was in its very early stages, that no publication date had been set, and that the encyclical would be about ecology (and specifically the "ecology of man").&lt;ref name="RoeweProgress" /&gt;

Cardinal [[Peter Turkson]], the president of the [[Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace]], and his team wrote the first draft of the encyclical.&lt;ref name="Kaleem" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VaticanRadio" /&gt; The draft was later reviewed by several theologians as well and sent (about three weeks before the encyclical's release) to the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], the second section of the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]], and the [[theologian of the Papal Household]].&lt;ref name="VaticanRadio" /&gt; Edits were made based on their responses.&lt;ref name="VaticanRadio" /&gt;

In drafting the encyclical, the Vatican consulted with leading scientific experts for months.&lt;ref name="GillisScience" /&gt; One of the experts consulted was [[Hans Joachim Schellnhuber]], the founder and head of the [[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]] and chair of the [[German Advisory Council on Global Change]].&lt;ref name="GillisScience" /&gt;

On 28 April 2015, in advance of the encyclical's release, the Vatican hosted a one-day conference on climate change, featuring Turkson, [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] (who delivered the keynote address), Ecuadorian president [[Rafael Correa]] and American economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]].&lt;ref name=weight /&gt;&lt;ref name="Correa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirchgaessner" /&gt;

The title and subtitle of the encyclical were first reported on in a [[Twitter]] message by Spanish-language journalist Mercedes De La Torre on 30 May 2015.&lt;ref name=titled /&gt; The Vatican confirmed that the title would be ''Laudato si' '' on 10 June.&lt;ref name=confirms /&gt; While some initial reports said the encyclical would be called ''Laudato Sii'', this was incorrect; the pope chose to use the original Umbrian form and spelling of the poem, with a single ''i''.&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt;

On 4 June, the Vatican press office announced that the encyclical – which was "already attracting global attention for its expected discourses on Catholic theology on ecology, current environmental destruction, and climate change" – would be released on 18 June.&lt;ref name=released /&gt;

=== Leak ===
Four days before the encyclical's release, the Italian magazine ''[[L'Espresso]]'' posted a leaked draft of the document online.&lt;ref name="Koffler" /&gt; The leaked document "almost exactly matched" the final document.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; The leak angered [[Vatican Curia|Vatican officials]]&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; who called it a "heinous act"&lt;ref name="Koffler" /&gt; and revoked the press credentials of the longtime ''L'Espresso''  Vatican correspondent [[Sandro Magister]].&lt;ref name="Winfield" /&gt; The ''New York Times'' and the Italian newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'' both noted suggestions that the leak came from conservatives inside the Vatican who wished to embarrass the pope and hinder the rollout of the encyclical.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winfield" /&gt;

=== Release ===
The encyclical letter was officially released at an event in the New Synod Hall of the [[Vatican City]].&lt;ref name="VaticanRadio" /&gt; Speaking at the press conference were Turkson, Schellnhuber, and [[John Zizioulas]] (the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[Pergamon]], representing the Orthodox Church).&lt;ref name=expert /&gt; On the day of the encyclical's official release, Pope Francis issued two messages about it on his official Twitter account, @Pontifex.&lt;ref name="Kaleem" /&gt; It has been suggested that the encyclical's release was timed to influence three summits being held at the [[United Nations]] on financial aid, sustainable development and climate change later in 2015.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;

== Reception ==
{{globalize|section|the English-speaking world|date=July 2015}}
After the encyclical was released, the Vatican's website was briefly inaccessible as many  people tried to read it.&lt;ref name=eco /&gt;  It has been described as "one of the shrewdest documents issued by the Vatican during the past century" and "has revealed Francis as a wily and sophisticated politician of the first order."&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;  It contains, according to [[Paul Vallely]], "a raft of defenses against critics who dismiss it as the work of some kind of left-wing maverick."&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;

=== Within Roman Catholic Church ===
The [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], led by its president [[Joseph Edward Kurtz]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Louisville|archbishop of Louisville]], described the encyclical as "our marching orders for advocacy"&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; and planned briefings on the encyclical with both chambers of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and with the [[White House]].&lt;ref name=cama /&gt;  Cardinal [[Seán Patrick O'Malley|Sean O'Malley]] of Boston said that the "constant linkage throughout the encyclical of the dual need to respect and protect "Our Common Home" and the need to respect and protect the dignity and lives of the poor may be regarded as the distinctive characteristic of this powerful message of Pope Francis."&lt;ref name=omalley/&gt;

Filipino Cardinal [[Luis Antonio Tagle]], the [[Archbishop of Manila]], wrote that "In ''Laudato si''' Pope Francis reminds us to replace consumption with a sense of sacrifice, greed with generosity and wastefulness with a spirit of sharing. We must "give, and not simply give up." We are called to free ourselves from all that is heavy and negative and wasteful and to enter into dialogue with our global family."&lt;ref name=tagle/&gt;

The three bishops of Northern and Central California, [[Stephen Blaire]], [[Armando Xavier Ochoa]], and [[Jaime Soto]], issued a joint statement that highlighted how climate change disproportionately affects the poor.  "The Catholic perspective is that human and natural ecology go hand in hand," the trio said. "We are called to solidarity with the poor as well as stewardship of the Earth. Our deep regard for the dignity of every person commands us to cultivate a climate of life where each of God's children thrive and join with creation in praising our Creator. This is the 'integral ecology' of which Pope Francis speaks."&lt;ref name=bee/&gt;

Bishop [[Richard Pates]] of [[Des Moines, Iowa]], which has the first major [[Presidential Primary|presidential primary]] contest in the United States, called on candidates to show courage and leadership on the issue, saying "With presidential candidates already visiting us regularly, I encourage Catholics across our state, and all people of good will, to talk to them and ask not if, but how, they plan to work toward solutions to climate change."&lt;ref name=plates/&gt;

[[Germany|German]] [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hamburg|Archbishop of Hamburg]] [[Stefan Heße]] praised the encyclical, calling it "valuable momentum for a worldwide ecological reorientation." He commented further, saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;He makes it clear that urgent issues of the future for the whole world and for all human beings have to be solved. Without a radical change of mentality, it will not do. Thus he underlines that the problems that concern all can be solved only by all.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.erzbistum-hamburg.de/ebhh/layer/layer_suchergebnis.php?we_objectID=4408&amp;pid=2|title = Erzbischof würdigt Umwelt-Enzyklika des Papstes|last =|first =|date = 18 June 2015|work = Erzbistum Hamburg|language = German|trans-title = Archbishop commends environmental papal encyclical|access-date = 11 March 2016|via =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://incaelo.wordpress.com/2015/06/19/bishops-react-to-laudato-si/|title = Bishops react to Laudato si'|last = de Vries|first = Mark|date = 19 June 2015|website = In Caelo et in Terra|publisher =|access-date = 11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Vaticanology|Vaticanologist]] [[John L. Allen, Jr.]], said in an analysis, "''Laudato si''' seems destined to go down as a major turning point, the moment when environmentalism claimed pride of place on a par with the [[dignity]] of human life and [[economic justice]] as a cornerstone of [[Catholic social teaching]]. It also immediately makes the Catholic Church arguably the leading moral voice in the press to combat global warming and the consequences of climate change."&lt;ref name=earthquake /&gt;

Catholic Millennials have written widely giving their opinions of the encyclical.&lt;ref name=mil/&gt;

====Criticism====
Samuel Gregg, director of research at the libertarian [[Acton Institute]], has criticized "the sheer overreach that plagues" ''Laudato si'''.&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;  [[RealClearReligion]] editor Nicholas Hahn has said that "Good Catholics can disagree on how to combat climate change and shouldn't worry about being sent to the confessional if they drive a SUV."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;

This criticism comes despite the fact that Francis took "care to locate his text firmly in the substantial body of teaching set out by previous popes," especially John Paul II and Benedict XVI, who are especially admired by conservative Catholics.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;

=== From other faiths ===
Three days before the encyclical was released, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] issued a Twitter message stating: "Since climate change and the global economy now affect us all, we have to develop a sense of the oneness of humanity."&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt;

Two days before the encyclical was released, [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Justin Welby]], head of the [[Anglican Communion]], issued a "green declaration" (also signed by the [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Methodist Conference]] as well as representatives of the [[Catholic Church in England and Wales]] and the British Muslim, Sikh and Jewish communities) urging a transition to a [[low-carbon economy]] and fasting and prayer for success at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|December 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt;&lt;ref name=joins /&gt;

The same day, the [[Lausanne Movement]] of global [[evangelical Christian]]s said it was anticipating the encyclical and was grateful for it.&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt;  The encyclical was also welcomed by the [[World Council of Churches]] and the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America]].&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

[[File:One Earth one family - Interfaith march in Rome to call for climate action.webm|thumb|upright=1.2|Pope Francis's environmental encyclical [[w:Laudato si'|''Laudato si''']] has been welcomed by many environmental organisations of different faiths – Interfaith march in Rome to call for climate action]]

=== From world leaders ===
The [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], [[Ban Ki-moon]], welcomed the encyclical in a statement on the day it was released.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name=spokesman /&gt; [[Kofi Annan]], the former UN secretary-general and current chair of the [[Africa Progress Panel]], also issued a statement in support of the encyclical, stating "As Pope Francis reaffirms, climate change is an all-encompassing threat. … I applaud the Pope for his strong moral and ethical leadership. We need more of such inspired leadership. Will we see it at the climate summit in Paris?"&lt;ref name=chair /&gt;

[[Christiana Figueres]], the executive secretary of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]], said: "Pope Francis is personally committed to this issue like no other pope before him. I do think the encyclical is going to have a major impact. It will speak to the moral imperative of addressing climate change in a timely fashion in order to protect the most vulnerable."&lt;ref name="Vidal" /&gt;

On the same day, [[Jim Yong Kim]], the president of the [[World Bank Group]], also praised the encyclical.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

=== From the scientific community ===
Science historian [[Naomi Oreskes]] observes that ''Laudato si''' "insists we embrace the moral dimensions of problems that have heretofore been viewed primarily as scientific, technological, and economic."&lt;ref name=Heald/&gt;&lt;ref name=oreskes/&gt;

The encyclical gave a boost to the [[fossil fuel divestment]] movement.&lt;ref name=schwartz /&gt;  Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, the founding director of the [[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]] (PIK) and chair of the [[German Advisory Council on Global Change]], who advised the Vatican on the drafting of the encyclical, said that "the science of ''Laudato si' '' is watertight" and gave the pontiff an "A" for command of the subject.&lt;ref name=expert /&gt;

An editorial in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' praised the encyclical for its statements about [[sustainability]] and global poverty and the [[energy transition|transition]] from [[fossil fuel]]s to [[renewable energy|renewable energy sources]]: "The papal calls to end poverty and share the world's ecological space in a fair way are objectives that mirror the United Nations' [[Sustainable Development Goals]], to be released in September. The Pope's letter adds an important facet to the discussion: it is not merely conceivable to secure a sound future for human civilization without relying on coal, oil and gas – it is a prerequisite."&lt;ref name=hope/&gt; However it criticized Francis for ignoring important issues like [[family planning]] and [[birth control]]. "Alas, he remained silent on issues of contraception. With a world population heading towards a possible 10 billion, the importance of family planning is clear. The Vatican has been brave on climate change. If it is serious about the fate of the planet and the welfare of its inhabitants, then it must be braver still on the issue of contraception."&lt;ref name=hope/&gt;

A review by nine climate scientists under the [[Climate Feedback]] project concluded the encyclical "rather accurately depicts the current reality of climate change" and "fairly represents the present concerns raised by the scientific community."&lt;ref name=feedback/&gt;

[[Nicholas Stern, Baron Stern of Brentford|Nicholas Stern]], chair of the [[Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment]] and author of an influential report on climate change, stated that "The publication of the Pope's encyclical is of enormous significance. He has shown great wisdom and leadership. Pope Francis is surely absolutely right that climate change raises vital moral and ethical issues.... Moral leadership on climate change from the Pope is particularly important because of the failure of many heads of state and government around the world to show political leadership."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

{{anchor|Daly's comment}}
Leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]] praised the Pope's encyclical on the grounds that it "... unifies the main divisions of [[Christianity]] on at least the fundamental recognition that we have a shamefully neglected duty to care for the [[Earth]] out of which we evolved, and to share the Earth's life support more equitably with each other, with the future, and with other creatures." Daly even believes that the Pope "skates fairly close to the idea of [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state economics]]," although the important issues of population stabilization, responsible [[family planning]] and [[Birth control|contraception]] were "conspicuously near-absent" in the encyclical.&lt;ref name=Daly/&gt;

===Impact on the United States political system===
[[Stephen F. Schneck]], the director of Institute for Policy Research &amp; Catholic Studies at [[The Catholic University of America]], has said that "Something's going to come out of this and it's definitely going to have an impact on public policy in the US."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;  However, Kathy Saile, the former long time director of the US bishops' office for domestic social justice, does not believe that "it will spark a climate change bill, but someday when negotiations are happening on a bill or a treaty, these kinds of moral teachings could have an influence."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt; Nonetheless, she added, "Pope Francis's tone, his honesty, how he talks about mercy and care for the poor, and his genuine desire to be a bridge," could influence political culture in Washington. "If he could change the tone of the debate, that would be an amazing gift."

[[Miami]] Archbishop [[Thomas Wenski]], chairman of the US bishops' committee on domestic peace and justice, wrote a letter to Congress letting them know that "The U.S. bishops stand united with the Holy Father in his call to protect creation."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;  He also asked them to "resist any effort to impair the development of a national carbon standard and instead to support our nation's ability to address this urgent global challenge confronting the human family."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;  Schneck opined that "This is different than the normal letters that the USCCB sends over all the time on a variety of issues. It really transcends the fault lines of both US politics and politics around the world."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;

Cornell anthropologists [[Annelise Riles]] and Vincent Ialenti told NPR.org: "We find ''Laudato Si''' important because it defies the United States' political imagination at every turn. In some moments, the pope reads like an archconservative, in other moments an archliberal. Sometimes he defers to scientists, other times he quotes scripture and, still other times, he criticizes the very foundations of economics. Mixing together ideas many see as incompatible, he forces us to think."&lt;ref&gt;*[https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2015/09/26/442485534/excited-about-the-popes-visit-read-laudato-si "Excited About The Pope's Visit? Read 'Laudato Si'"] Cosmos &amp; Culture, NPR.org (26 September 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' reported that the encyclical put pressure on Catholics seeking the [[Republican Party presidential candidates, 2016|Republican Party nomination for president of the United States]] in 2016, including [[Jeb Bush]], [[Marco Rubio]], and [[Rick Santorum]], who "have questioned or denied the established science of human-caused climate change, and have harshly criticized policies designed to tax or regulate the burning of fossil fuels."&lt;ref name=davenport /&gt; Jeb Bush said: "I hope I'm not going to get castigated for saying this by my priest back home, but I don't get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinal or my pope."&lt;ref name=backlash /&gt;

====Neoconservative critique and counterarguments====
[[Neoconservative]] circles in the United States have criticized the encyclical right from its publication in Rome, sometimes in very harsh terms.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt;  Writing in the ''[[Weekly Standard]]'', [[Irwin M. Stelzer]] has argued that

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
Pope Francis is unambiguously opposed to the American system of "savage capitalism". He has famously quoted a fourth century Doctor of the Church, [[St. Basil of Caesarea]], who called money "the devil's dung", has railed against the "anonymous influences of mammon" and a "new colonialism" that includes "free trade treaties... [and] imposition of austerity," and stated a preference for "cooperatives". Throw in Francis' views that we are witnessing "a disturbing warming of the climatic system... due to the great concentration of greenhouse gasses," and that "there is an urgent need of a true world political authority," and you have positions that it will take more than a spoonful of the Pontiff's charm to make go down the throats of many Americans.&lt;ref name=Stelzer/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== From industry ===
A [[lobbyist]] of [[Arch Coal]] sent an email to Republican lawmakers stating the pope "does not appear to address the tragedy of global [[energy poverty]]." The lobbyist argued the church should promote fossil fuels instead if he really cared about the poor.&lt;ref name=backlash /&gt; The email suggested "talking points" to the legislators for defending the coal industry and rejecting the arguments of the pope. The lobbyist wrote: "Billions of people around the globe are living without electrification and suffering through untold poverty and disease as a result." In contrast to these arguments the encyclical argues that fossil fuels in general and coal in particular threaten the poor: Fossil fuels are a threat to prosperity for the poor. They would suffer even more in particular from sea level rise, droughts, warming and extreme weather caused by burning fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newrepublic.com/article/122052/climate-deniers-say-nope-red-pope  Climate Deniers Say Nope to "Red Pope"], ''The New Republic'', 17 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From other groups ===

The [[LGBT]]-interest magazine ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' noted that the encyclical contains passages which reinforce the church's position against the [[transsexuality]] movement, calling for "the acceptance of our bodies as God's gift."&lt;ref name="TheAdvocate"/&gt;

[[Bill McKibben]] in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' reviewed the encyclical.&lt;ref name="McKibben"/&gt;

== In music ==
On behalf of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg|Diocese of Limburg]], [[Peter Reulein]] wrote the music for the [[oratorio]] ''[[Laudato si' (oratorio)|Laudato si' – a Franciscan Magnificat]]'' to the [[libretto]] by [[Helmut Schlegel]] [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]].&lt;ref name="Laudato si-score"&gt;{{cite book | last = Reulein | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Reulein | last2 = Schlegel | first2 = Helmut | authorlink2 = Helmut Schlegel | title = Laudato si' / Ein franziskanisches Magnificat | publisher = [[Patrick Dehm|Dehm Verlag]] | location = [[Limburg an der Lahn]] | year = 2016 | isbn = 978-3-943302-34-9 | pages = 230 | ismn = 979-0-50226-047-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work is based on the Latin version of the [[Magnificat]], corresponds to the ''[[Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy]],'' and includes texts from the [[apostolic exhortation]] ''[[Evangelii gaudium]]'' and the [[encyclical]] ''Laudato si'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10547">A community has been defined as a group of interacting people living in a common location. The word is often used to refer to a group that is organized around common values and is attributed with social cohesion within a shared geographical location, generally in social units larger than a household. The word can also refer to the national community or global community.
The word "community" is derived from the Old French communité which is derived from the Latin communitas (cum, "with/together" + munus, "gift"), a broad term for fellowship or organized society.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, U. 1992. Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity. London: Sage&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[sense]] of community refers to people's [[perception]] of [[interconnection]] and [[interdependence]], shared [[Social responsibility|responsibility]], and [[wiktionary:Common|common]] [[goal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa M. Ahern, Michael S. Hendryx, Kris Siddharthan
Medical Care, Vol. 34, No. 9 (Sep., 1996), pp. 863-986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chavis DM, Wandersman A. Sense of community in the urban environment: A catalyst for participation and community development. Am J Community Psychol 1990;18:55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McMillan DW, Chavis DM. Sense of community: A definition and theory. J Community Psychol 1986;14:6.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding a community entails having knowledge of community needs and resources, having respect for community members, and involving key community members in programs.&lt;ref&gt;Sustaining Community-Based Programs for Families: Conceptualization and Measurement
Jay A. Mancini, Lydia I. Marek. ''[[Family Relations (journal)|Family Relations]]'', Vol. 53, No. 4 (Jul., 2004), pp. 339-419.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits of local community==
The author [[Robert Putnam]] refers to the [[value (economics)|value]] which comes from social networks as [[social capital]] in his book ''Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community.'' He writes that social capital "makes an enormous difference in our lives", that "a society characterized by generalized reciprocity is more efficient that a distrustful society" and that economic sociologists have shown a minimized economic wealth if social capital is lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Robert D. ''Bowling Alone: the Collapse and Revival of American Community''. New York: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2000. pp.21,289-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

Putnam reports that the first use of the social capital theory was by [[L. J. Hanifan]], a practical reformer during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States of America. The following description of social capital is a quote from L.J. Hanifan in Putnam's Book:

{{quote|
Those tangible substances [that] count for most in the daily lives of people: namely good will, fellowship, sympathy, and social intercourse among individuals and families who make up a social unit…. The individual is helpless socially, if left to himself…. If he comes into contact with neighbor, and they with other neighbors, there will be an accumulation of social capital, which may immediately satisfy his social needs and which may bear a social potentiality sufficient to the substantial improvement of living conditions in the whole community. The community as a whole will benefit by the cooperation of all its parts, while the individual will find in his associations the advantages of the help, sympathy, and fellowship of his neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Lyda Judson Hanifan, "The Rural School Community Center," Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 67 (1916): 130-138, quotation at 130. Found in Putnam, Robert D. Bowling Alone: the Collapse and Revival of American Community. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2000. Print.a&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

;Employment
Putnam reported that many studies have shown that the highest predictor of [[job satisfaction]] is the presence of social connection in the [[Wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]]. He writes that "people with friends at work are happier at work." And that "social networks provide people with advice, a bonus, a promotion, and other strategic information, and letters of recommendation."&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Robert D. (2000), p.90. Referencing: Jeanne S. Hurlbert, "Social Networks, Social Circles, and Job satisfaction," Work and Occupations, 18 (1991): 415-438; Randy Hodson, "Group Relations at Work: Solidarity, Conflict, and Relations with Management," Work and Occupations 24 (1997): 426-452; Ronnie Sandroff, "The power of Office Friendships," Working Mother (November 1997): 35-36, and the works cited there.&lt;/ref&gt;

Community engagement has been proven to counteract the most negative attributes of poverty and a high amount of social capital has been shown to reduce crime.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Robert D. (2000), pp.297-308.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Local community and health
"Social connectedness matters to our lives in the most profound way." -Robert Putnam.&lt;ref name="putnam326"&gt;Putnam, Robert D. (2000), p.326.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Putnam reports, in the chapter ''Health and Happiness'' from his book ''Bowling Alone'', that recent public research shows social connection impacts all areas of human health, this includes psychological and physical aspects of human health. Putnam says "...beyond a doubt that social connectedness is one of the most powerful determinates of our well being."&lt;ref name="putnam326" /&gt; In particular it is face to face connections which have been show to have greater impacts then non-face to face relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Robert D. (2000), p.332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific health benefits of strong social relationships are a decrease in the likelihood of: seasonal viruses, heart attacks, strokes, cancer, depression, and premature death of all sorts.&lt;ref name="putnam326" /&gt;

; Online initiatives
There are online initiatives to improve local community's like LOCAL (www.localchange.com).

== Community sustainability==
[[Sustainability]] in community programs is the capacity of programs (services designed to meet the needs of community members) to continuously respond to community issues.

A sustained program maintains a focus consonant with its original goals and objectives, including the [[individuals]], [[families]], and communities it was originally intended to serve. Programs change regarding the breadth and depth of their programming. Some become aligned with other organizations and established institutions, whereas others maintain their independence.
Understanding the community context in which programs serving the community function has an important influence on program sustainability and success.&lt;ref name="lafond"&gt;LaFond, A. K. (1995). Improving the quality of investment in health: Issues on sustainability. Health Policy and Planning (Suppl. 10), 63-76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mancini-marek"&gt;Sustaining Community-Based Programs for Families: Conceptualization and Measurement

==Local economy==
{{main|Local economy}}
According to [[Washington (state)|Washington State]]'s [[Sustain South Sound]] organization, the top ten reasons to [[Local purchasing|buy locally]] are:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.oly-wa.us/SustainSouthSound/TopTenReasonsToBuyLocal.php Top Ten Reasons to Buy Local] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20100307105614/http://www.oly-wa.us/SustainSouthSound/TopTenReasonsToBuyLocal.php |date=2010-03-07 }}'', [[Sustain South Sound]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

# To strengthen local economy: Studies have shown that buying from an independent, locally owned business, significantly raises the number of times your money is used to make purchases from other local businesses, service providers and farms—continuing to strengthen the economic base of the community.
# Increase jobs: Small local businesses are the largest employer nationally in the United States of America.
# Encourage local prosperity: A growing body of economic research shows that in an increasingly homogenized world, entrepreneurs and skilled workers are more likely to invest and settle in communities that preserve their one-of-a-kind businesses and distinctive character.
# Reduce environmental impact: Locally owned businesses can make more local purchases requiring less transportation and generally set up shop in town or city centers as opposed to developing on the fringe. This means contributing less to greenhouse gas emissions, sprawl, congestion, habitat loss and pollution.
# Support community groups: Non-profit organizations receive an average 250% more support from smaller business owners than they do from large businesses.
# Keep your community unique: Where we shop, where we eat and have fun—all of it makes our community home.
# Get better service: Local businesses often hire people with a better understanding of the products they are selling and take more time to get to know customers.
# Invest in community: Local businesses are owned by people who live in the community, are less likely to leave, and are more invested in the community's future.
# Put your taxes to good use: Local businesses in town centers require comparatively little infrastructure investment and make more efficient use of public services as compared to nationally owned stores entering the community.
# Buy what you want, not what someone wants you to buy: A marketplace of tens of thousands of small businesses is the best way to ensure innovation and low prices over the long-term. A multitude of small businesses, each selecting products based not on a national sales plan but on their own interests and the needs of their local customers, guarantees a much broader range of product choices.

'''Nitrokey''' is an open source [[USB]] key to enable secure encryption and signing of data. The secret keys are always stored inside the Nitrokey which protects against [[malware]] (such as [[computer viruses]]) and attackers. A user-chosen PIN and a tamper-proof smart card protect the Nitrokey in case of loss and theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nitrokey {{!}} Secure your digital life|url = http://www.nitrokey.com|website = www.nitrokey.com|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Introduction {{!}} Nitrokey|url = https://www.nitrokey.com/introduction|website = www.nitrokey.com|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;The hardware and software of Nitrokey are available as [[open source]], [[free software]] and [[open hardware]] which enables independent parties to verify the security of the device. Nitrokey is supported on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[macOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Krypto-Stick verschlüsselt Mails und Daten|url = https://www.heise.de/ct/ausgabe/2016-5-News-Sicherheit-3104236.html|website = c‘t Magazin für Computer und Technik.|accessdate = 2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Krypto-Multitool|url = https://www.heise.de/ct/ausgabe/2016-10-Krypto-Stick-NitroKey-Pro-3186997.html|website = c‘t Magazin für Computer und Technik.|accessdate = 2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 2008 Jan Suhr, Rudolf Böddeker and another friend were travelling and found themselves looking to use encrypted emails in [[internet cafés]], which meant the secret keys had to remain secure against [[computer viruses]]. Some proprietary USB dongles existed at the time, but lacked in certain ways. Consequentially, they established as an [[open source]] project - Crypto Stick&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Der mit Open-Source-Methoden entwickelte Crypto-USB-Stick|url = http://www.linux-magazin.de/Ausgaben/2010/12/Magisches-Leuchten|website = Linux-Magazin|accessdate = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; - in August 2008 which grew to become Nitrokey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = GnuPG-SmartCard und den CryptoStick|url = https://www.privacy-handbuch.de/handbuch_32r.htm|website = Privacy-Handbuch|accessdate = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a spare-time project of the founders to develop a hardware solution to enable the secure usage of [[email encryption]]. The first version of the Crypto Stick was released on 27 December 2009. In late 2014 the founders decided to professionalize the project, which was renamed Nitrokey. Nitrokey's firmware was audited by German cybersecurity firm [[Cure53]] in May 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heiderich|first1=Mario|last2=Horn|first2=Jann|last3=Krein|first3=Nikolai|title=Pentest-Report Nitrokey Storage Firmware 05.2015|url=https://cure53.de/pentest-report_nitrokey.pdf|publisher=Cure53|accessdate=15 February 2016|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its hardware was audited by the same company in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nedospasov|first1=Dmitry|last2=Heiderich|first2=Mario|title=Pentest-Report Nitrokey Storage Hardware 08.2015|url=https://cure53.de/pentest-report_nitrokey-hardware.pdf|publisher=Cure53|accessdate=15 February 2016|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first four Nitrokey models became available on 18 September 2015.

== Technical features ==
Several Nitrokey models exist and the Nitrokey Pro is the flagship model. It contains the following features:
* A secure key storage to support [[OpenPGP]] (popular with individuals) and [[S/MIME]] (popular with businesses) email encryption standards. Nitrokey can also be used with various 3rd party applications such as [[TrueCrypt]] and [[VeraCrypt]] for disk encryption.
* [[One-time password]]s (which are similar to [[Transaction authentication number|TANs]] and used as a secondary security measure in addition to ordinary passwords). It supports the [[HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm]] (HOTP, &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 4226&lt;/nowiki&gt;) and [[Time-based One-time Password Algorithm]] (TOTP, &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 6238&lt;/nowiki&gt;), which are compatible with [[Google Authenticator]].
* Client Certificate Authentication is used to administrate servers securely via SSH, access Virtual Private Networks via [[OpenVPN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to secure your Linux environment with Nitrokey USB smart card|url = http://xmodulo.com/linux-security-with-nitrokey-usb-smart-card.html|website = Xmodulo|accessdate = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Password Safe stores encrypted static passwords inside the Nitrokey.

The upcoming Nitrokey Storage provides the same features as the Nitrokey Pro and additionally contains an encrypted mass storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nitrokey Storage: USB Security Key for Encryption|url = https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/nitrokey-storage-usb-security-key-for-encryption#/|website = Indiegogo|accessdate = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
* Nitrokey's secret keys are stored securely internally.
* A user-chosen PIN protects in case of loss and theft.
* Nitrokey's tamper-proof design protects it from sophisticated physical attacks.
* [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]] keys of up to 4096 bit and [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES-256]] are supported.
* It is supported for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]] and [[Linux]].
* It is compatible with many popular software like [[Microsoft Outlook]], [[Mozilla Thunderbird]], and [[OpenSSH]].
* The secure implementation of the Nitrokey is published as open source and open hardware&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nitrokey|url = https://github.com/nitrokey|website = GitHub|accessdate = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; to enable independent reviews of the [[source code]] and [[hardware layout]] and to ensure the absence of back doors and other security flaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nitrokey Storage Firmware and Hardware Security Audits|url = https://www.opentech.fund/article/nitrokey-storage-firmware-and-hardware-security-audits|website = Open Technology Fund|accessdate = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nitrokey's security is not dependent upon secret keys stored centrally with the device manufacturer.
* Nitrokey is published as [[open source software]], [[free software]], and [[open hardware]].

== Philosophy ==
Nitrokey's developers believes that proprietary systems can't provide strong security and that security systems need to be open source. For instance there have been cases in which [[National Security Agency|NSA]] intercepts security devices being shipped and implanted backdoors into it. In 2011 [[RSA Security|RSA]] was hacked and secret keys of [[RSA SecurID|securID]] tokens been stolen which allowed hackers to circumvent their authentication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = RSA Break-In Leaves SecurID Users Sweating Bullets {{!}} Security {{!}} TechNewsWorld|url = http://www.technewsworld.com/story/72100.html|website = www.technewsworld.com|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As revealed in 2010, many FIPS 140-2 Level 2 certified USB storage devices from various manufacturers could easily be cracked by using a default password.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FIPS 140-2 Level 2 Certified USB Memory Stick Cracked - Schneier on Security|url = https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/01/fips_140-2_leve.html|website = www.schneier.com|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrokey, because of being open source and because of its transparency, wants to provide high secure system and avoid security issues which its proprietary rivals were facing. Nitrokey's mission is to provide the best Open Source security key to protect the digital lives of its users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Using CryptoStick as an HSM|url = https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2013/02/13/using-cryptostick-as-an-hsm/|website = Mozilla Security Blog|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''O2 Global Network''' ('''O2 International Network for Sustainable Design''', stylized as '''O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Global Network''') is an [[international]] network for people interested in [[sustainable design]]. The [[Social network|network]] is made up of the O2 Global Network foundation, [[regional]] hubs, local groups, [[wikt:liaison|liaison]]s and individuals (called O2's). It has currently more than 70 country contacts.

==History==
O2 ("[[Oxygen]]") was founded in 1988 in [[Milan]] by Niels Peter Flint, Thierry Kazazian, Jorgi Scheicher, Jeremy Quinn and others. O2 Groups in [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]] followed.
Six years later (5 July 1994), [[Iris de Graaf]] and [[Willem Hanhart]] founded the O2 Global Network foundation, or in short, the O2 Global Network. O2GN, as it became to be known, was set up as an independent organization. Its first home page appeared in November that year, and by August 1995, the network had hosted their first [[World Wide Web|web]] [[broadcasting|broadcast]], live from [[Rotterdam]].

==Objective==
For nearly two decades, O2 has pioneered solutions to a central problem of the made environment: ''how to foster sustainability while having a good quality of life''. The people in this forum have been wrestling with the problems of a throw-away culture, formulating non-[[polluting]] [[Manufacturing|production]] methods, sourcing non-toxic, sustainably managed [[Chemical susbtance|materials]], innovative sustainable product services, sustainable [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]], [[behavior]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]—and, most importantly, passing on that [[knowledge]].

The basic idea of the O2 Global Network is ''"global thinking and local action"''. Global information and knowledge is exchanged and discussed. Local groups, mostly [[non-governmental organization]]s, or O2 individuals organize lectures, projects and workshops as well as distributing newsletters to promote, educate and implement design for [[sustainability]], with all of its facets in mind.

==Members==
The network involves people with a background in [[design]], [[industrial design]], [[architecture]], [[packaging design]], [[graphic design]], [[art]]s, [[fashion]], and [[innovation]], as well as people from [[academies]], [[universities]], public authorities, [[companies]] or knowledge centers. The O2 Global Network's primary method of communication is by means of electronic media such as the home page and an [[electronic mailing list]] where information and knowledge can be exchanged. O2 Hubs, O2 groups and O2 liaisons can be found worldwide.

      <comment>/* Mechanisms of Pharmaceutical Drug Toxicity */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10521">'''Pharmacotoxicology''' entails the study of the consequences of [[Toxin|toxic]] exposure to [[pharmaceutical]] [[drug]]s and agents in the [[health care]] field.  The field of pharmacotoxicology also involves the treatment and prevention of pharmaceutically induced [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]]. Pharmacotoxicology can be separated into two different categories: [[pharmacodynamics]] (the effects of a drug on an organism), and [[pharmacokinetics]] (the effects of the organism on the drug).

==Mechanisms of Pharmaceutical Drug Toxicity==
There are many mechanisms by which pharmaceutical drugs can have toxic implications. A very common mechanism is covalent binding of either the drug or its metabolites to specific enzymes or receptor in tissue-specific pathways that then will elicit toxic responses. Covalent binding can occur during both on-target and off-target situations and after [[biotransformation]].

===On-target toxicity.=== 
On-target toxicity is also referred to as mechanism-based toxicity. This type of adverse effect that results from pharmaceutical drug exposure is commonly due to interactions of the drug with its intended target. In this case, both the therapeutic and toxic targets are the same. To avoid toxicity during treatment, many times the drug needs to be changed to target a different aspect of the illness or symptoms. [[Statins]] are an example of a drug class that can have toxic effects at the therapeutic target ([[HMG CoA reductase]]).&lt;ref name="Guengerich"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guengerich|first1=F. Peter|title=Mechanisms of Drug Toxicity and Relevance to Pharmaceutical Development|journal=Drug Metab Pharmokinet.|date=2011|volume=26|issue=1|pages=3–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immune Responses===
Some pharmaceuticals can initiate allergic reactions, as in the case of [[penicillins]]. In some people, administration of penicillin can induce production of specific antibodies and initiate an immune response. Activation of this response when unwarranted can cause severe health concerns and prevent proper immune system functioning.&lt;ref name="Guengerich" /&gt; Immune responses to pharmaceutical exposure can be very common in accidental contamination events. [[Tamoxifen]], a [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]], has been shown to alter the humoral adaptive immune response in gilthead seabream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodenas|first1=M.C.|last2=Cabas|first2=I.|last3=Abellán|first3=E.|last4=Meseguer|first4=J.|last5=Mulero|first5=V.|last6=García-Ayala|first6=A.|title=Tamoxifen persistently disrupts the humoral adaptive immune response of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.)|journal=Developmental &amp; Comparative Immunology|date=December 2015|volume=53|issue=2|pages=283–292|doi=10.1016/j.dci.2015.06.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, pharmaceuticals can produce adverse effects not only in humans, but also in organisms that are unintentionally exposed.

===Off-target toxicity===
Adverse effects at targets other than those desired for pharmaceutical treatments often occur with drugs that are nonspecific. If a drug can bind to unexpected proteins, receptors, or enzymes that can alter different pathways other than those desired for treatment, severe downstream effects can develop. An example of this is the drug [[eplerenone]] (aldosterone receptor antagonist), which should increase aldosterone levels, but has shown to produce atrophy of the prostate.&lt;ref name="Rudmann"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rudmann|first1=Daniel G.|title=On-target and off-target-based toxicologic effects|journal=Toxicologic Pathology|date=2013|volume=41|pages=310–314|doi=10.1177/0192623312464311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bioactivation===
[[Bioactivation]] is a crucial step in the activity of certain pharmaceuticals. Often times, the parent form of the drug is not the active form and it needs to be metabolized in order to produce its therapeutic effects. In other cases, bioactivation is not necessarily needed for drugs to be active and can instead produce reactive intermediates that initiate stronger adverse effects than the original form of the drug. Bioactivation can occur through the action Phase I metabolic enzymes, such as [[cytochrome P450]] or [[peroxidases]]. Reactive intermediates can cause a loss of function in some enzymatic pathways or can promote the production of [[reactive oxygen species]], both of which can increase stress levels and alter homeostasis.

===Drug-drug interactions===
Drug-drug interactions can occur when certain drugs are administered at the same time. Effects of this can be additive (outcome is greater than those of one individual drug), less than additive (therapeutic effects are less than those of one individual drug), or functional alterations (one drug changes how another is absorbed, distributed, and metabolized).&lt;ref name="Hussar"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hussar|first1=Daniel A.|title=Drug Interactions|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/drugs/factors-affecting-response-to-drugs/drug-interactions|website=Merck Manuals Consumer Version}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug-drug interactions can be of serious concern for patients who are undergoing multi-drug therapies.&lt;ref name="OATPs"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alam|first1=Khondoker|last2=Pahwa|first2=Sonia|last3=Wang|first3=Xueying|last4=Zhang|first4=Pengyue|last5=Ding|first5=Kai|last6=Abuznait|first6=Alaa H.|last7=Li|first7=Lang|last8=Yue|first8=Wei|title=Downregulation of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 transport function by lysosomotropic drug chloroquine: implication of OATP-mediated drug-drug interactions|journal=Molecular Pharmaceutics|date=2016|volume=13|pages=839–851}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coadministration of [[chloroquine]], an anti-malaria drug, and statins for treatment of cardiovascular diseases has been shown to cause inhibition of [[organic anion-transporting polypeptide]]s (OATPs) and lead to systemic statin exposure.&lt;ref name="OATPs"/&gt;

==Pharmacotoxicity Examples==
There are many different pharmaceutical drugs that can produce adverse effects after biotransformation, interaction with alternate targets, or through drug-drug interactions. All pharmaceuticals can be toxic, depending on the dose.&lt;ref name="Casarett &amp; Doull's"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Klaassen|editor1-first=Curtis D.|title=Casarett and Doull's toxicology : the basic science of poisons|date=2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|location=New York|isbn=0-07-176923-4|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acetaminophen===
[[Acetaminophen]] (APAP) is a very common drug used to treat pain. High doses of acetaminophen has been shown to produce severe [[hepatotoxicity]] after being biotransformed to produce reactive intermediates. Acetaminophen is metabolized by CYP2E1 to produce [[NAPQI]], which then causes significant oxidative stress due to increased [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS).&lt;ref name="Mechanistic"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boelsterli|first1=Urs A.|title=Mechanistic Toxicology the Molecular Basis of How Chemicals Disrupt Biological.|date=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=London|isbn=0-203-36176-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ROS can cause cellular damage in a multitude of ways, a few of which being DNA and mitochondrial damage and depletion of antioxidant enzymes such as [[glutathione]]. In terms of drug-drug interactions, acetaminophen activates [[CAR]], a nuclear receptor involved in the production of metabolic enzymes, which increases the metabolism of other drugs. This could either cause reactive intermediates/drug activity to persist for longer than necessary, or the drug will be cleared quicker than normal and prevent any therapeutic actions from occurring. Ethanol induces CYP2E1 enzymes in the liver, which can lead to increased NAPQI formation in addition to that formed by acetaminophen.&lt;ref name="Mechanistic" /&gt;

===Aspirin===
Aspirin is an [[NSAID]] used to treat inflammation and pain. Overdoses or treatments in conjunction with other NSAIDs can produce additive effects, which can lead to increased oxidative stress and ROS activity. Chronic exposure to aspirin can lead to CNS toxicity and eventually affect respiratory function.&lt;ref name="Long"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Long|first1=Scott|title=Toxicity of Selected Drugs|url=http://faculty.swosu.edu/scott.long/txcl/drugtox.htm|website=faculty.swosu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-depressants===
Anti-depressants have been prescribed since the 1950s, and their prevalence has significantly increased since then. There are many classes of anti-depressant pharmaceuticals, such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] (MAOIs), and [[tricyclic anti-depressants]]. Many of these drugs, especially the SSRIs, function by blocking the metabolism or reuptake of neurotransmitters to treat depression and anxiety. Chronic exposure or overdose of these pharmaceuticals can lead to seratonin and CNS hyperexcitation, weight changes, and, in severe cases, suicide.&lt;ref name="Long" /&gt;

===Anti-cancer drugs===
[[Doxorubicin]] is a very effective anti-cancer drug that causes congestive heart failure while treating tumors.&lt;ref name="Mechanistic" /&gt; Doxorubicin is an uncoupling agent in that it inhibits proper functioning of complex I of the electron transport chain in mitochondria. It then leads to the production of ROS and the inhibition of ATP production. Doxorubicin has been shown to be selectively toxic to cardiac tissue, although some toxicity has been seen in other tissues as well.&lt;ref name="Mechanistic" /&gt; Other anti-cancer drugs, such as [[fluoropyrimidines]] and [[taxanes]], are extremely effective at treating and reducing tumor proliferation, but have high incidences of cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial infarctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosa|first1=Gian Marco|last2=Gigli|first2=Lorenzo|last3=Tagliasacchi|first3=Maria Isabella|last4=Di Iorio|first4=Cecilia|last5=Carbone|first5=Federico|last6=Nencioni|first6=Alessio|last7=Montecucco|first7=Fabrizio|last8=Brunelli|first8=Claudio|title=Update on cardiotoxicity of anti-cancer treatments|journal=European Journal of Clinical Investigation|date=March 2016|volume=46|issue=3|pages=264–284|doi=10.1111/eci.12589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phase Angle 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Phase angle diagram]]

'''Phase angle''' in [[Observational astronomy|astronomical observation]]s is the angle between the light incident onto an observed [[Astronomical object|object]] and the light reflected from the object. In the context of astronomical observations, this is usually the angle [[Sun]]-object-observer.

For terrestrial observations, "Sun–object–Earth" is often nearly the same thing as "Sun–object–observer", since the difference depends on the [[parallax]], which in the case of observations of the [[Moon]] can be as much as 1°, or two full Moon diameters. With the development of [[Spaceflight|space travel]], as well as in hypothetical observations from other points in space, the notion of phase angle became independent of Sun and Earth.

The [[etymology]] of the term is related to the notion of [[planetary phase]]s, since the [[brightness]] of an object and its appearance as a "phase" is the function of the phase angle.

The phase angle varies from 0° to 180°. The value of 0° corresponds to the position where the illuminator, the observer, and the object are collinear, with the illuminator and the observer on the same side of the object. This is known as [[astronomical opposition]]. The value of 180° is the position where the object is between the illuminator and the observer. Values less than 90° represent [[backscatter]]ing; values greater than 90° represent [[forward scatter]]ing.

For some objects, such as the [[Moon]] (see [[lunar phases]]), [[Venus]] and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] the phase angle (as seen from the Earth) covers the full 0&amp;ndash;180° range. The [[superior planet]]s cover shorter ranges. For example, for [[Mars]] the maximum phase angle is about 45°.

The brightness of an object is a function of the phase angle, which is generally smooth, except for the so-called [[opposition spike]] near 0°, which does not affect gas giants or bodies with pronounced atmospheres, and when the object becomes fainter as the angle approaches 180°. This relationship is referred to as the [[Phase curve (astronomy)|phase curve]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12022">The '''phenomenology of religion''' concerns the [[Experience|experiential]] aspect of [[religion]], describing religious phenomena in terms consistent with the orientation of worshippers. It views religion as made up of different components, and studies these components across religious traditions in order to gain some understanding of them.

== Chantepie de la Saussaye ==
The first explicit use of the phrase "phenomenology of religion" occurs in the ''Lehrbuch der Religionsgeschichte'' (Handbook of the History of Religions), written by Pierre Daniël Chantepie de la Saussaye in 1887, wherein he articulates the task of the science of religion and gives an "Outline of the phenomenology of religion".&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1963: 694; cf. James: 42-45)&lt;/ref&gt; Employing the terminology of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], Chantepie divides his science of religion into two areas of investigation, essence and manifestations, which are approached through investigations in philosophy and history, respectively.  However, Chantepie’s phenomenology "belongs neither to the history nor the philosophy of religion as Hegel envisioned them".&lt;ref&gt;45&lt;/ref&gt; For Chantepie, it is the task of phenomenology to prepare historical data for philosophical analysis through "a collection, a grouping, an arrangement, and a classifying of the principal groups of religious conceptions".&lt;ref&gt;43&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of phenomenology as a grouping of manifestations is similar to the conception of phenomenology articulated by Robison and the British; however, insofar as Chantepie conceives of phenomenology as a preparation for the philosophical elucidation of essences, his phenomenology is not completely opposed to that of Hegel.

== Kristensen ==
Chantepie’s ''Lehrbuch'' was highly influential, and many researchers began similar efforts after its publication and its subsequent translation into English and French.&lt;ref&gt;141&lt;/ref&gt; One such researcher was [[William Brede Kristensen]].  In 1901, Kristensen was appointed the first professorship relating to the phenomenology of religion at the University of Leiden.&lt;ref&gt;[[ibid]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the material from Kristensen’s lectures on the phenomenology of religion was edited posthumously, and the English translation was published in 1960 as ''The Meaning of Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;Kristensen: xiii&lt;/ref&gt; James notes that Kristensen’s phenomenology "adopts many of the features of Chantepie’s grouping of religious phenomena," and penetrates further into the intricacies of Chantepie’s phenomenological approach.&lt;ref&gt;James: 141-43&lt;/ref&gt;
  
For Chantepie, phenomenology is affected by the philosophy and [[history of religion]], but for Kristensen, it is also the medium whereby the philosophy and history of religion interact with and affect one another.&lt;ref&gt;Kristensen: 9&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, Kristensen’s account of the relationship between historical manifestations and philosophy is more similar to that of Hegel than it is to Chantepie.  In defining the religious essence of which he explores historical manifestations, Kristensen appropriates [[Rudolf Otto]]’s conception of ''das Heilige'' ("the holy" or "the sacred").  Otto describes ''das Heilige'' with the expression ''mysterium tremendum et fascinans''—a numinous power revealed in a moment of "awe" that admits of both the horrible shuddering of "religious dread" (''tremendum'') and fascinating wonder (''fascinans'') with the overpowering majesty (''majestas'') of the ineffable, "wholly other" mystery (''mysterium'').&lt;ref&gt;Kristensen: 15-18; Otto: 5-32&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Chantepie, Kristensen argues that phenomenology seeks the “meaning” of religious phenomena.  Kristensen clarifies this supposition by defining the meaning that his phenomenology is seeking as “the meaning that the religious phenomena have for the believers themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;James: 144&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Kristensen argues that phenomenology is not complete in grouping or classifying the phenomena according to their meaning, but in the act of understanding.  “Phenomenology has as its objects to come as far as possible into contact with and to understand the extremely varied and divergent religious data”.&lt;ref&gt;Kristensen: 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a phenomenologist, Kristensen was less interested in philosophical presuppositions than in his concrete depth-research in the incidental religious phenomena. These subjects concerned mythological material (such as Creation, the Flood etc.) as well as human action (such as baptism, Olympic Games etc.), and objects of nature and handicrafts.
In all of this he only made use of the authentic sources: writings and images by the believers themselves. This procedure compelled him to reduce the field of his research - he had to profoundly master all relating languages and writings in order to be able to understand his sources in a way as they would have wanted to be understood themselves.
Consequently, he reduced his field of research to the phenomena in religions living around the origin of Christianity: during the millennia before and the centuries after Christ, in Iran (Avesta), Babylonia and Assyria, Israel, Egypt, Greece and Rome.
The required knowledge of speeches, also, is one of the causes that only few (Van der Leeuw, Bleeker) of his pupils did carry on in his line, although many scholars showed interests in the results of his research.
Apart from his synopsis ''The Meaning of Religion'', and a just simple ''Introduction in History of Religion'', his publications are mostly restricted to the results of his incidental partial researches, published in the shape of a Communication of the Royal Academy of the Netherlands.

== van der Leeuw ==
The phenomenological approach to religion developed in [[Gerardus van der Leeuw]]’s ''Phänomenologie der Religion'' (1933) follows Kristensen in many respects, while also appropriating the phenomenology of [[Martin Heidegger]] and the [[hermeneutics]] of [[Wilhelm Dilthey]].

For van der Leeuw, understanding is the subjective aspect of phenomena, which is inherently intertwined with the objectivity of that which is manifest.  Van der Leeuw articulates the relation of understanding to understood phenomena according to the schema outlined in Dilthey’s definition of the human sciences (''Geisteswissenschaften'') as sciences that are “based on the relations between experience, expression and understanding” (“''Verhältnis von Erlebnis, Ausdruck, und Verstehen''”).&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1956: 776; 1963a: 676&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Leeuw correlates subjective experience, expression, and understanding with three objective levels of appearing—relative concealment (''Verborgenheit''), relative transparency (''Durchsichtigkeit''), and gradually becoming manifest or revealed (''Offenbarwerden''), wherein the understanding of what is becoming revealed is the primordial level of appearing from which the experienced concealment and expressed transparency of appearing are derived.&lt;ref&gt;1956: 769; 1963a: 671&lt;/ref&gt;

Because van der Leeuw, like Kristensen, appropriates Otto’s concept of ''das Heilige'' in defining the essential category of religion, the transcendence becoming revealed in all human understanding can be further described as sacred — an overpowering “wholly other,” which becomes revealed in astonishing moments of dreadful [[awe]] (''Scheu'') and wonderful fascination.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1963: 23, 681; Otto: 14-32&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Leeuw argues that this concept of religious dread is also present in Kierkegaard’s work on ''[[Angst]]'' and in Heidegger’s statement that “what arouses dread is ‘being in the world’ itself”.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1963: 463; cf. Kierkegaard; Heidegger 1962; 230&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, van der Leeuw recognizes that, although dreadful, Being-in-the-world is fundamentally characterized as [[wikt:cura|care]] (''Sorge''), the existential structure whereby ''[[Dasein]]'' is concerned with meaningful relationships in the world alongside other beings.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1963: 339, 543; cf. Heidegger 1962: 364-70&lt;/ref&gt;

Because all experiences disclose concealed (wholly other) transcendence to the understanding, all experiences of Being-in-the-world are ultimately religious experiences of the sacred, whether explicitly recognized as such or not.  Human being as such is ''[[homo religiosus]]'', the opposite of ''homo negligens''.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1963: 50, 680&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the task of the phenomenology of religion to interpret the various ways in which the sacred appears to human beings in the world, the ways in which humans understand and care for that which is revealed to them, for that which is ultimately wholly other mystery.
Among other great phenomenologists who worked and influenced phenomenology of religion are [[Henry Corbin]],  [[Ninian Smart]], [[Mircea Eliade]].

[[File:Radiant slab.png|thumb|380px| Diagram of a room cooled with a high mass radiant ceiling slab. The slab is absorbing heat radiated from the people, surfaces, equipment, and lights in the room.]]

'''Radiant cooling''' is the use of cooled surfaces to remove [[sensible heat]] by [[radiation]] and [[convection]]. It is related to [[Radiant heating and cooling system|radiant heating]]. Radiant systems that use water to cool the radiant surfaces are called [[hydronic]] systems. Unlike “all-air” air conditioning systems that circulate cooled air only, hydronic radiant systems circulate cooled water in pipes through specially-mounted panels or a building’s [[floor]] or [[ceiling]] to provide comfortable temperatures. There is a separate system to provide air for [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], [[dehumidification]], and potentially additionally cooling.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Handbook Ch6"&gt;{{cite book|title=ASHRAE Handbook.

==Background==

===Definition===
By definition, radiant cooling systems primarily remove sensible heat through [[thermal radiation]]. [[ASHRAE]] defines radiant systems as temperature-controlled surfaces where 50% or more of the design heat transfer takes place by thermal radiation.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Handbook Ch6" /&gt;

===Physics===
[[Thermal radiation|Thermal (longwave) radiation]] travels at the speed of light, in straight lines.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Handbook Ch6" /&gt; It can be reflected. People, equipment, and surfaces in buildings will warm up if they absorb thermal radiation, but the radiation does not noticeably heat up the air it is traveling through.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Handbook Ch6" /&gt; This means heat will flow from objects, occupants, equipment, and lights in a space to a cooled surface as long as their temperatures are warmer than that of the cooled surface and they are within the direct or indirect line of sight of the cooled surface. Some heat is also removed by [[convection]] because the air temperature will be lowered when air comes in contact with the cooled surface.

===History===
Radiant heating systems have been used for thousands of years, notably in ancient Korea, China, and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Bean |first= Robert |last2= Olesen |first2= Bjarne |last3= Kim |first3= Kwang Woo |date= February 2010 |title= History of Radiant Heating and Cooling Systems – Part 2 |url= https://healthyheating.com/History_of_Radiant_Heating_and_Cooling/History_of_Radiant_Heating_and_Cooling_Part_2.pdf |magazine= ASHRAE Journal |location= Atlanta, GA (USA) |publisher= ASHRAE |access-date= 8 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hydronic radiant cooling systems are relatively more recent.

==System design==

Radiant cooling systems are usually [[hydronic]], cooling using circulating water running in pipes in thermal contact with the surface. Typically the circulating water only needs to be 2–4&amp;nbsp;°C below the desired indoor air temperature.&lt;ref name="Olesen2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olesen|first=Bjarne W.|title=Hydronic Floor Cooling Systems|journal=ASHRAE Journal|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once having been absorbed by the actively cooled surface, heat is removed by water flowing through a hydronic circuit, replacing the warmed water with cooler water.

Since the majority of the cooling process results from removing sensible heat through radiant exchange with people and objects and not air, occupant thermal comfort can be achieved with warmer interior air temperatures than with air based cooling systems. As a result of the high cooling capacity of water, and the delivery of a cooled surface close to the desired indoor air temperature, radiant cooling systems potentially offer reductions in cooling energy consumption.&lt;ref name="Stetiu 1999"/&gt; The latent loads (humidity) from occupants, infiltration and processes generally need to be managed by an independent system. Radiant cooling may also be integrated with other energy-efficient strategies such as night time flushing, indirect [[evaporative cooling]], or [[ground source heat pumps]] as it requires a small difference in temperature between desired indoor air temperature and the cooled surface.&lt;ref name="Olesen2008" /&gt;

==System types==

While there are a broad range of system technologies, there are two primary types of radiant cooling systems. The first type is systems that deliver cooling through the building structure, usually slabs. These systems are also named thermally activated building systems (TABS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gwerder|first=M. |author2=B. Lehmann |author3=J. Tödtli |author4=V. Dorer |author5=F. Renggli|title=Control of thermally-activated building systems (TABS)|journal=Applied Energy|date=July 2008|volume=85|issue=7|pages=565–581|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2007.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second type is systems that deliver cooling through specialized panels. Systems using concrete slabs are generally cheaper than panel systems and offer the advantage of thermal mass, while panel systems offer faster temperature control and flexibility.

===Chilled slabs===

Radiant cooling from a slab can be delivered to a space from the floor or ceiling. Since radiant heating systems tend to be in the floor, the obvious choice would be to use the same circulation system for cooled water. While this makes sense in some cases, delivering cooling from the ceiling has several advantages.

First, it is easier to leave ceilings exposed to a room than floors, increasing the effectiveness of thermal mass. Floors offer the downside of coverings and furnishings that decrease the effectiveness of the system.

Second, greater convective heat exchange occurs through a chilled ceiling as warm air rises, leading to more air coming in contact with the cooled surface.

Cooling delivered through the floor makes the most sense when there is a high amount of solar gain from sun penetration, because the cool floor can more easily remove those loads than the ceiling.&lt;ref name="Olesen2008" /&gt;

Chilled slabs, compared to panels, offer more significant thermal mass and therefore can take better advantage of outside diurnal temperatures swings. Chilled slabs cost less per unit of surface area, and are more integrated with structure.

===Ceiling panels===

Radiant cooling panels are generally attached to ceilings, but can be attached to walls also. They are usually suspended from the ceiling, but can also be directly integrated with continuous dropped ceilings. Modular construction offers increased flexibility in terms of placement and integration with lighting or other electrical systems. Lower thermal mass compared to chilled slabs means they can’t easily take advantage of passive cooling from thermal storage, but controls in panels can more quickly adjust to changes in outdoor temperature. Chilled panels are also better suited to buildings with spaces that have a greater variance in cooling loads.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Handbook Ch6" /&gt; Perforated panels also offer better acoustical dampening than chilled slabs. Ceiling panels are also very suitable for retrofits because they can be attached to any ceiling. Chilled ceiling panels can be more easily integrated with ventilation supplied from the ceiling. Panels tend to cost more per unit of surface area than chilled slabs.

==Advantages==

Radiant cooling systems offer lower energy consumption than conventional cooling systems based on research conducted by the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]. Radiant cooling energy savings depend on the climate, but on average across the US savings are in the range of 30% compared to conventional systems. Cool, humid regions might have savings of 17% while hot, arid regions have savings of 42%.&lt;ref name="Stetiu 1999" /&gt; Hot, dry climates offer the greatest advantage for radiant cooling as they have the largest proportion of cooling by way of removing sensible heat. While this research is informative, more research needs to be done to account for the limitations of simulation tools and integrated system approaches. Much of the energy savings is also attributed to the lower amount of energy required to pump water as opposed to distribute air with fans. By coupling the system with building mass, radiant cooling can shift some cooling to off-peak night time hours. Radiant cooling appears to have lower first costs &lt;ref name="Mumma2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mumma|first=S.A.|title=Chilled ceilings in parallel with dedicated outdoor air systems: Addressing the concerns of condensation, capacity, and cost|journal=ASHRAE Transactions|year=2002|volume=108|issue=2|pages=220–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lifecycle costs compared to conventional systems. Lower first costs are largely attributed to integration with structure and design elements, while lower life cycle costs result from decreased maintenance. However, a recent study on comparison of VAV reheat versus active chilled beams &amp; DOAS challenged the claims of lower first cost due to added cost of piping &lt;ref name="Stein and Taylor 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stein|first=Jeff |author2=Steven T. Taylor |title=VAV Reheat Versus Active Chilled Beams &amp; DOAS|journal=ASHRAE Journal|year=2013|volume=55|issue=5|pages=18–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limiting factors==

Because of the potential for condensate formation on the cold radiant surface (resulting in water damage, mold and the like), radiant cooling systems have not been widely applied. [[Condensation]] caused by [[humidity]] is a limiting factor for the cooling capacity of a radiant cooling system. The surface temperature should not be equal or below the [[dew point temperature]] in the space. Some standards suggest a limit for the [[relative humidity]] in a space to 60% or 70%.  An air temperature of 26&amp;nbsp;°C (79&amp;nbsp;°F) would mean a dew point between 17&amp;nbsp;°C and 20&amp;nbsp;°C (63&amp;nbsp;°F and 68&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name="Olesen2008" /&gt; There is, however, evidence that suggests decreasing the surface temperature to below the dew point temperature for a short period of time may not cause [[condensation]].&lt;ref name="Mumma2002" /&gt; Also, the use of an additional system, such as a [[dehumidifier]] or [[Dedicated outdoor air system|DOAS]], can limit humidity and allow for increased cooling capacity.

'''Radiosynthesis'''  is the theorized capture and [[metabolism]], by living organisms, of energy from [[ionizing radiation]], analogously to [[photosynthesis]]. Metabolism of ionizing radiation was theorized as early as 1956 by the Russian S. I. Kuznetsov.&lt;ref name=Kuznetsov&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuznetsov|first1=S. I.|title=On the Question of Possibility of "Radiosynthesis"|journal=Mikrobiologiya|date=March 1, 1956|language=Russian|osti=4367507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1990s, researchers at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] uncovered some 200 species of apparently [[radiotrophic fungus|radiotrophic fungi]] containing the pigment [[melanin]] on the walls of the reactor room and in the surrounding soil.&lt;ref name="Zhdanova-1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhdanova|first1=N.

Following the Russian results, an American team at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] of [[Yeshiva University]] in New York began experimenting with radiation exposure of melanin and melanized fungi. They found that ionizing radiation increased the ability of melanin to support an important metabolic reaction, and that ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'' fungi grew three times faster than normal.&lt;ref name="Dadachova-paper"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dadachova|first1=Ekaterina|last2=Bryan|first2=Ruth A.|last3=Huang|first3=Xianchun|last4=Moadel|first4=Tiffany|last5=Schweitzer|first5=Andrew D.|last6=Aisen|first6=Philip|last7=Nosanchuk|first7=Joshua D.|last8=Casadevall|first8=Arturo|title=Ionizing Radiation Changes the Electronic Properties of Melanin and Enhances the Growth of Melanized Fungi|journal=PLOS One|date=May 23, 2007|volume=2|issue=5|page=e457|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000457|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000457|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Balter"/&gt; Microbiologist Ekaterina Dadachova suggested such fungi could serve as a food supply and source of [[radiation protection]] for [[interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary astronauts]], who would be exposed to [[cosmic ray]]s.&lt;ref name="Balter"/&gt;

In 2014, the American research group was awarded a patent for a method of enhancing the growth of [[microorganisms]] through increasing melanin content.

'''Radon mitigation''' is any process used to reduce [[radon]] gas concentrations in the breathing zones of occupied buildings, or radon from water supplies. Radon is a [[radium and radon in the environment|significant contributor]] to [[environmental radioactivity]].

Mitigation of radon in the air is accomplished through ventilation, either collected below a concrete floor slab or a membrane on the ground, or by increasing the [[air changes per hour]] in the building. Treatment systems using aeration or activated charcoal are available to remove radon from domestic water supplies.

==Testing==
[[File:Radon test kit.jpg|thumb|A typical radon test kit]]
[[File:Radon-indoor-one-week.svg|thumb|Fluctuation of ambient air radon concentration over one week, measured in a laboratory]]
The first step in mitigation is testing to see if the indoor-air and/or domestic water radon concentrations should be reduced. No level of radiation is considered completely safe but it cannot be totally eliminated so governments around the world have set various ''action levels'' to provide guidance on when radon concentrations should be reduced while recognizing that radon cannot be eliminated. The World Health Organization's [[International Radon Project]] has recommended an action level of 2.7 pCi/l for radon in the air. Radon in the air is considered to be a larger health threat than radon in domestic water so the US Environmental Protection Agency recommendation is to not test for radon in water unless a radon in air test is above the action level. However, some US states, such as Maine where radon levels are higher than the national average, recommend all well water should be tested for radon. The US government has not set an action level for radon in water.

Air-radon levels fluctuate naturally on a daily and seasonal basis. A short term test (90 days or less) might not be an accurate assessment of a home's average radon level, but are recommended for initial testing to quickly determine unhealthy conditions. Transient weather such as wind and changes in barometric pressure can affect short-term concentrations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radon.com/radon/mitigation.html |title=You've found radon in your home—what should you do? |accessdate=2008-02-02 |publisher=Air Chek, Inc. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224030656/http://www.radon.com/radon/mitigation.html |archivedate=2007-12-24 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ventilation such as open windows and the operation of exhaust fans.

Testing for radon in the air is accomplished using passive or active devices placed in the building. Some devices are promptly sent to a laboratory for analysis, others calculate the results on-site. Radon-in-water testing requires a water sample being sent to a laboratory.

Retesting is recommended in several situations such as to double check test results before spending money on the installation of a mitigation system. Test results which exceed accuracy tolerances also require re-testing. When a mitigation system installation is warranted, a retest after the system is functional is advised to be sure the system is effectively reducing the radon concentration below the action level, and after any mitigation system repairs such as replacing a fan unit. Retesting is also recommended every ten years.

===Testing in the United States===
[[File:USradonmapforhouses.jpg.png|thumb|Radon map of the United States]]
[[ASTM International|ASTM]] E-2121 is a US standard for reducing air-born radon in homes as far as practicable below the action level of 4 [[picocurie]]s per liter (pCi/L) (148 [[becquerel|Bq]]/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/iaq/radon/pubs/mitstds.html |title=Recommended Residential Radon Mitigation Standard of Practice |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |date= |accessdate=2008-02-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116184748/http://www.epa.gov/iaq/radon/pubs/mitstds.html |archivedate=2008-01-16 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/SoftCart.exe/DATABASE.CART/REDLINE_PAGES/E2121.htm?L+mystore+xyan5063| title = ASTM E2121-03 Standard Practice for Installing Radon Mitigation Systems in Existing Low-Rise Residential Buildings |publisher = ASTM International |date = |accessdate = 2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states recommend achieving 2.0 pCi/L or less.

Radon test kits are commercially available&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drhomeair.com/order/drha_order1.php |title=Commercially Available Radon Kits |accessdate=2012-04-19 |publisher=Alpha Energy Labs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712143535/http://www.drhomeair.com/order/drha_order1.php |archivedate=2012-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be used by homeowners, tenants and in limited cases by landlords, except when a property is for sale.

Commercially available test kits includes a passive collector that the user places in the lowest livable floor of the house for 2 to 7 days. The user then sends the collector to a laboratory for analysis. Long-term kits, taking collections from 91 days to one year, are also available.  Open land test kits can test radon emissions from the land before construction begins, but are not recommended by the EPA because they do not accurately predict the final indoor radon level.  The EPA and the National Environmental Health Association have identified 15 types of radon test devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radongas.org/device.htm |title=Radon Measurement Method Definitions |accessdate=2008-02-02 |publisher=The National Environmental Health Association—National Radon Proficiency Program |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224165447/http://www.radongas.org/device.htm |archivedate=2007-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Lucas cell]] is one type of device.

Retesting is specifically recommended in several situations. Measurements between 4 and 10 pCi/L (148 and 370 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) warrant a follow-up short term or long-term radon test before mitigation. Measurements over 10 pCi/L (370 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) warrant only another short-term test (not a long term test) so that abatement measures are not unduly delayed.

Purchasers of real estate may delay or decline a purchase if the seller has not successfully abated radon to less than 4 pCi/L.

It should be noted that the accuracy of the residential radon test depends upon the lack of ventilation in the house when the sample is being obtained.  Thus the occupants will be instructed not to open windows, etc., for ventilation during the pendency of test, usually two days or more.  However, the occupants, if the present owners, will be motivated to pass the test and insure the sale, so they might be tempted to open a window to get a lower radon score.  Moreover, there may be children or immature teens or young adults in the house who will open a window for ventilation notwithstanding instructions not to do so, particularly in uncomfortably hot weather.  Accordingly, whether the potential purchaser should trust the result of such a test is problematic.

Management of radon service provider certification has evolved since being introduced by the EPA in 1986. In the 1990s this service was "privatized" and the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) helped transition the voluntary National Radon Proficiency Program (NRPP) to be administered by private firms. {{As of|2012}}, the NRPP is administered by the American Association of Radon Scientists and Technologists (AARST).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrpp.info/history.shtml |title=National Radon Proficiency Program - NEHA and NEHA-NRPP History |publisher=Nrpp.info |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states, such as Maine, require landlords to test their rental properties and turn the results in to the state. In limited cases the landlord or tenant(s) may do the testing themselves. The rules in each state vary. In many cases there are private contractors that will inspect hired by the city.

===Testing in Canada===
Canadian Government, in conjunction with the territories and provinces, developed the guideline&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radoncontrol.ca/radon-gas--vancouver%2c-bc%2c-canada.html |title=Radon Gas &amp;#124; Vancouver, BC, Canada |publisher=Radoncontrol.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; to indicate when remedial action should be taken was originally set at 800 Bq/m³ ([[becquerel]]s per cubic meter) and since reduced to 200 Bq/m³. This new guideline was approved by the Federal Provincial Territorial Radiation Protection Committee in October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/radiation/radon/faq_fq-eng.php#reaction |title=Radon Frequently Asked Questions - Health Canada |publisher=Hc-sc.gc.ca |date=2014-07-30 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of radon gas mitigation==
[[File:Connecticut Radon Mitigation.jpg|thumb|upright|Part of a radon mitigation system including the fan and vent pipe is visible near the gutter downspout.]]Because high levels of radon have been found in every state of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.radonrid.com/comp/myth-vs-fact| title = Radon: Myth vs Fact| accessdate = 2009-11-13| publisher = Radon-Rid/EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; testing for radon and installing radon mitigation systems has become a specialized industry since the 1980s.  Many states have implemented programs that affect home buying and awareness in the real estate community, however radon testing and mitigation systems are not generally mandatory unless specified by the local jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.epa.gov/radon/rrnc/code_listing.html| title = Listing of States and Jurisdictions with RRNC Codes| accessdate = 2009-11-13| publisher = EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the EPA's "A Citizen's Guide to Radon",&lt;ref name="A Citizen's Guide to Radon"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.epa.gov/radon/pubs/citguide.html#lower| title = A Citizen's Guide to Radon| accessdate = 2010-04-03| publisher = EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; the method to reduce radon "primarily used is a vent pipe system and fan, which pulls radon from beneath the house and vents it to the outside", which is also called sub-slab depressurization, active soil depressurization, or soil suction. Generally indoor radon can be mitigated by sub-slab depressurization and exhausting such radon-laden air to the outdoors, away from windows and other building openings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radon-solution.com/pg_mitigation_methods.php |title=Radon Mitigation Methods |accessdate=2008-12-02 |publisher=Radon Solution |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215190050/http://radon-solution.com/pg_mitigation_methods.php |archivedate=2008-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "EPA generally recommends methods which prevent the entry of radon. Soil suction, for example, prevents radon from entering your home by drawing the radon from below the home and venting it through a pipe, or pipes, to the air above the home where it is quickly diluted" and "EPA does not recommend the use of sealing alone to reduce radon because, by itself, sealing has not been shown to lower radon levels significantly or consistently" according to the EPA's "Consumer's Guide to Radon Reduction: How to fix your home".&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.epa.gov/radon/pubs/consguid.html#reductiontech| title = Consumer's Guide to Radon Reduction: How to fix your home| accessdate = 2010-04-03| publisher = EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ventilation systems can utilize a heat exchanger or energy recovery ventilator to recover part of the energy otherwise lost in the process of exchanging air with the outside.  For crawlspaces, the EPA states,&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; "An effective method to reduce radon levels in crawlspace homes involves covering the earth floor with a high-density plastic sheet. A vent pipe and fan are used to draw the radon from under the sheet and vent it to the outdoors. This form of soil suction is called submembrane suction, and when properly applied is the most effective way to reduce radon levels in crawlspace homes."

The most common approaches are active soil depressurization (ASD) and [[ventilation (architecture)|mechanical ventilation]] (MV). Experience has shown that ASD is applicable to most buildings since radon usually enters from the soil and rock underneath and MV is used when the indoor radon is emitted from the building materials. A less common approach works efficiently by reducing air pressures within cavities of exterior and demising walls where radon emitting from building materials, most often concrete blocks, collects. 
*Above slab air pressure differential barrier technology (ASAPDB) requires that the interior pressure envelope, most often [[drywall]], as well as all ductwork for air conditioning systems, be made as airtight as possible. A small blower, often no more than 15 cubic feet per minute (0.7 l/s) may then extract the radon-laden air from these cavities and exhaust it to the out of doors. With well-sealed [[HVAC]] ducts, very small negative pressures, perhaps as little as 0.5 [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] (0.00007 [[pound-force per square inch|psi]]), will prevent the entry of highly radon-laden wall cavity air from entering into the breathing zone. Such ASAPDB technology is often the best radon mitigation choice for high-rise condominiums as it does not increase indoor humidity loads in hot humid climates, and it can also work well to prevent mold growth in exterior walls in heating climates.
*In hot, humid climates, [[heat recovery ventilator]]s (HRV) as well as [[energy recovery ventilator]]s (ERV) have a record of increasing indoor relative humidity and dehumidification demands on air conditioning systems. Mold problems have originated in homes that have been radon mitigated with HRV and ERV installations in hot, humid climates.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} HRVs and ERVs have an excellent record in heating climates.
*A recent technology is based on [[building science]]. It includes a variable rate mechanical ventilation system that prevents indoor relative humidity from rising above a preset level such as 50% which is currently suggested by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] and others as an upper limit for the prevention of mold. It has proven to be especially effective in hot, humid climates. It controls the air delivery rate so that the air conditioner is never overloaded with more moisture than it can effectively remove from the indoor air.
*It is generally assumed that air conditioner operation will remove excess moisture from the air in the breathing zone, but it is important to note that just because the air conditioner cools does not mean that it is also dehumdifying. If Δ''t'' is 14 degrees or less, it may not dehumidify at all even though it is cooling.
*Factors that are likely to aggravate indoor humidity problems from mechanical ventilation–based radon installations are as follows and an expert radon mitigator/building scientist will check for and correct any and all of the following when he or she performs radon mitigation procedures:
** Air conditioner duct leaks located outside the breathing zone, such as in the attic.
** Excessive exhaust fan operation
** Oversize or over-capacity air conditioners
** AC air handler fans that do not stop running when the air conditioner compressor stops running.
** Delta ''t'' (Δ''t''), which is the amount that the air is cooled as it is passed through the air conditioner's cooling coils. A good Δ''t'' performance figure for home air conditioners is about 20&amp;nbsp;°F (11&amp;nbsp;°C). In comparison, automobile air conditioners deliver Δ''t'' performance of 32 to 38&amp;nbsp;°F (18 to 21&amp;nbsp;°C). A Δ''t'' of 14&amp;nbsp;°F (8&amp;nbsp;°C) will dehumidify poorly if at all.

In South Florida, most radon mitigation is performed by use of fixed rate mechanical ventilation. Radon mitigation training in Florida does not include problems associated with mechanical ventilation systems, such as high indoor humidity, mold, moldy odors, property damage or health consequences of human occupation in high humidity of moldy environments{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. As a result, most Florida radon mitigators are unaware of and do not incorporate existing building science moisture management technology into mechanical ventilation radon installations. Home inspectors may not necessarily be aware of the mold risks associated with radon mitigation by mechanical ventilation.

The average cost for an ASD radon mitigation system in Minnesota is $1500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/indoorair/radon/mitigationsystem.html |title=Radon Mitigation System - EH: Minnesota Department of Health |publisher=Health.state.mn.us |date=2014-12-10 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These costs are very dependent on the type of home and age of construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radonreductioninc.com/tag/featured-radon-mitigation-system/ |title=Featured Radon Mitigation System Archives |publisher=Radonreductioninc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of radon-in-water mitigation==
{{expand section|date=March 2015}}
Radon removal from water supplies may be at a treatment plant, point of entry, or point of use. Public water supplies in the United States were required to treat for radionuclides beginning in 2003 but private wells are not regulated by the federal government {{as of|2014|lc=y}}. The radon can be captured by granular activated charcoal (GAR) or released into the air through aeration of the water. Radon will naturally dissipate from water over a period of days, but the quantity of storage needed to treat the water in this manner makes home systems of this type impracticably large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.epa.gov/scitech/drinkingwater/dws/radon/upload/2001_01_09_radon_hrrcafr.pdf|format=PDF|title="Radon in Drinking Water Health Risk Reduction and Cost Analysis: Notice"|journal=''Federal Register''|volume= 64|date=February 26, 1999|accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activated carbon systems capture radon from the water. The amount of radiation accumulates over time and the filter material may reach the level of requiring disposal as a [[radioactive waste]]. However, in the United States there are no regulations concerning radiation levels and disposal of radon treatment waste {{as of|2014|lc=y}}.

Aeration systems move the radon from the water to the air. Radon gas discharged into the air is the release of a pollutant, and may become regulated in the United States.

[[Image:Basic Phase Converter.jpg|thumb|200px|A simple homemade phase converter]]

A '''rotary phase converter''', abbreviated '''RPC''', is an [[electrical machine]] that converts power from one [[polyphase system]] (including frequency) to another, converting through rotary motion. Typically, [[single-phase electric power]] is used to produce [[three-phase electric power]] locally to run three-phase loads (any industrial machinery with three-phase motors) in premises (often residential or consumer) where only single-phase is available.

==Operation==
The main principles of RPC operation are as follows:

Three-phase induction motors have three terminals called "legs", usually numbered (arbitrarily) L1, L2, and L3.

A three-phase induction motor can be run at two-thirds of its rated horsepower on single-phase power applied to any pair of legs, once spun up by some means.

A three-phase induction motor that is spinning under single-phase power applied to legs L1 and L2, generates an electric potential (and can deliver power through) leg L3, although without some form of current injection, special windings in the idler, or other means the voltage will sag when a load is applied.

[[Power factor correction#Power factor correction in non-linear loads|Power factor correction]] is a very important consideration when building or choosing an RPC. This is desirable because an RPC that has power factor correction will consume less current from the single-phase service supplying power to the phase converter and its loads.

Balanced voltage between the three legs of power is important for operational life of the equipment receiving that power. Unbalanced three-phase power can damage the equipment that it is meant to operate.

==History==
[[File:V50.jpg|thumbnail|right|The first locomotive with a phase converter (only for demonstration purposes)]]
[[File:Kandó-féle fázisváltó 1933-ban.jpg|thumb|right|262px|The Kandó phase converter (1933)]]
[[File:Kando mozdony.jpg|thumbnail|right|The "Kandó" locomotive, the first locomotive using a phase converter system]]

At the beginning of the 20th century, there were two main principles of electric railway [[traction current]] systems:
# DC system
# 16⅔&amp;nbsp;Hz [[single phase]] system
These systems used [[Universal motor|series-wound traction motors]]. All of them needed a separated supply system or converters to take power from the standard 50&amp;nbsp;Hz electric network.

=== Kandó synchronous phase converter ===
[[Kálmán Kandó]] recognized that the electric traction system must be supplied by single-phase 50&amp;nbsp;Hz power from the standard electric network, and it must be converted in the locomotive to three-phase power for traction motors.
&lt;!-- 
Clarify. Series motors, and why 1 phase on the supply? The series motor needs 16 1/3 Hz network. The single phase needs because a single overhead line can supply only a single-phase. More overhead lines increases expenses and decreases the speed
--&gt;

He created an electric machine called a synchronous phase converter, which was a single-phase [[synchronous motor]] and a three-phase [[synchronous generator]] with common stator and rotor.

It had two independent windings:
* The outer winding is a single-phase synchronous motor. The motor takes the power from the [[overhead line]].
* The inner winding is a three-phase (or variable-phase) synchronous generator, which provides the power for the three- (or more) phase traction motors.

=== Single-phase supply ===
The direct feed from a standard electric network makes the system less complicated than the earlier systems and makes possible simple recuperation.

The single-phase feed makes it possible to use a single overhead line. More overhead lines increase the costs, and restrict the maximum speed of train.

=== Speed control ===
The asynchronous traction motor can run on a single RPM determined by the frequency of the feeding current and the loading torque.

The solution was to use more secondary windings on phase converter, and more windings on motor different number of magnetic poles.

==Types ==
A rotary phase converter (RPC) may be built as a [[motor-generator]] set. These completely isolate the load from the single-phase supply and produce balanced three-phase output. However, due to weight, cost, and efficiency concerns, most RPCs are not built this way.

Instead, they are built out of a three-phase induction motor or generator, called an idler, on which two of the terminals (the idler inputs) are powered from the single-phase line.  The [[Magnetic flux|rotating flux]] in the motor produces a voltage on the third terminal. A voltage is induced in the third terminal that is shifted by 120° from the voltage between the first two terminals. In a three-winding motor, two of the windings are acting as a motor, and the third winding is acting as a generator.

===Power quality===
A common measure of the quality of the power produced by an RPC or any phase converter is the voltage balance, which may be measured while the RPC is driving a balanced load such as a three-phase motor. Other quality measures include the harmonic content of the power produced and the [[power factor]] of the RPC motor combination as seen by the utility. Selection of the best phase converter for any application depends on the sensitivity of the load to these factors.   Three-phase [[induction motor]]s are very sensitive to voltage imbalances.

The quality of three-phase power generated by such a phase converter depends upon a number of factors including:
* Power capacity of the phase converter (idler horsepower rating).
* Power level demands of the equipment being supplied. For instance, "hard starting" loads such as heavily loaded machinery or well pumps may have higher requirements than other loads rated at the same horsepower.
* Power quality demands of the equipment being supplied ([[Numerical control|CNC equipment]] may have more stringent power quality requirements than a [[Arc welding|welding machine]])
* Use of techniques to balance the voltage between the three legs.

===Quality improvement===
RPC manufacturers use a variety of techniques to deal with these problems. Some of the techniques include,

*  The insertion of capacitors between the terminals to balance the power at a particular load.
*  The use of idlers with higher power ratings than the loads.
*  The construction of special idler motors with more windings on the third terminal to boost the voltage and compensate for the sag caused by the load.
*  The use of electronics to switch in capacitors, during start up or otherwise, based on the load.
*  The use of filters.

==Uses==

===General===
Demand exists for phase converters due to the use of three-phase motors. With increasing power output, three-phase motors have preferable characteristics to single-phase motors; the latter not being available in sizes over {{convert|15|hp|abbr=on}} and, though available, rarely seen larger than {{convert|5|hp|abbr=on}}. (Three-phase motors have higher efficiency, reduced complexity, with regards to starting, and three-phase power is significantly available where they are used.)

===Electric railways===
Rotary phase converters are used to produce a single-phase for the single overhead conductor in [[railway electrification system|electric railways]].  Five European countries ([[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]]), where electricity is three-phase AC as 50&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]], have standardised on single-phase AC at 15&amp;nbsp;kV 16⅔&amp;nbsp;Hz for railway electrification; phase converters are, therefore, used to change both phases and [[frequency changer|frequency]].  In the [[Soviet Union]], they were used on AC locomotives to convert single phase, 50&amp;nbsp;Hz to 3-phase for driving [[induction motors]] for [[traction motor]] cooling blowers, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Захарченко Д.Д., Ротанов Н.А. "Тяговые электрические машины" (Traction electrical мachinery) Москва, Транспорт, 1991 - 343 p., p.231&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives to rotary converters ==
Alternatives exist to rotary phase converters for operation of three-phase equipment on a single-phase power supply.

=== Static phase converters ===
These may be an alternative where the issue at hand is starting a motor, rather than polyphase power itself. The static phase converter is used to start a three-phase motor. The motor then runs on a single phase with a synthesised third pole. However, this makes the power balance, and thus motor efficiency, extremely poor, requiring de-rating the motor (typically to 60% or less).  Overheating, and quite often destruction of the motor, will result from failing to do so.  (Many manufacturers and dealers specifically state that using a static converter will void any warranty.)  An oversized static converter can remove the need to de-rate the motor, but at an increased cost.

=== Three-phase inverters ===
Three-phase inverters and related [[variable frequency drive]]s, may, under certain circumstances,  produce large amounts of harmonic distortion in their output, and the efficiency of the inverter-motor combination can be poor.

When poor efficiency in a VFD powered motor has been investigated, in every case documented to date, the root cause for the loss in efficiency was either improper installation or a failure to adhere to best practices.   Almost universally,  a VFD increases the efficiency of a system and reduces operating costs.

=== Inverter drives (VFDs) ===
Inverter drives (VFDs) can damage some motors not rated for use with an inverter, but this is not a concern when motor voltages are less than 440 VAC.  Motor manufacturers may void warranties on non-inverter rated motors if they are run at a variable speed or with an inverter, but most three-phase motors over {{convert|10|hp|abbr=on}} sold today are rated for use with an inverter drive.

This damage can be prevented by the use of load and [[line reactor]]s or in Europe a DU/DT filter. This reactor or filter reduces the voltage stack up that can occur on older high impedance motors such as wound rotor motors. The filter prevents the windings of the motor form insulation breakdown caused by voltage stack up.

VFDs that have a capacity greater than 3&amp;nbsp;hp can be costly, thus making the RPC an attractive option.

'''"Scientific Integrity in Policymaking: An Investigation into the Bush Administration's Misuse of Science"''' is the title of a report published by the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] in February, 2004. The report was the culmination of an investigation of the [[George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s objectivity in [[science]], and ultimately a [[critic]]ism thereof.&lt;ref name="UCS2004"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific Integrity in Policy Making (2004)|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/center-science-and-democracy/promoting-scientific-integrity/reports-scientific-integrity.html|website=Union of Concerned Scientists|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (After it was published, the report's existence was fairly well-publicized by the [[United States]]' [[mass media]].)

== "Suppression and distortion of research findings" ==
[[File:Condoleezza_Rice_Colin_Powell_George_W._Bush_Donald_Rumsfeld.jpg|thumb|200px|Rice, Powell, Bush, and Rumsfeld]]
A central thesis of the report, according to the Executive Summary (on page 2 of the text), was that the Bush administration had behaved in ways considered to be consistent with the following three situations.

# Epidemic altering and concealing of scientific [[information]] by senior officials in various federal [[Government agency|agencies]]
# Active censorship of scientific information that the administration considered threatening to its own [[Philosophy|philosophies]]
# Restriction of the ability of government-supported scientists to freely communicate scientific [[idea]]s related to "sensitive" issues

== "An unprecedented pattern of behavior" ==

In "Part III", the text of the report posits that the aforementioned activities are unprecedented in the [[history of the United States]]. The report lists the following persons and organization who had supposedly acted or made statements to support this claim.

''This list is sorted first by category, then by the order in which the persons or organizations are mentioned in the report.''

* Organization
** [[REP America]]
* Persons

** [[Donald Kennedy|Kennedy, Donald]]
** [[D. Allan Bromley|Bromley, Dr. D. Allan]]
** [[Lewis M. Branscomb|Branscomb, Professor Lewis M.]]
** [[Lynn Goldman|Goldman, Dr. Lynn]]

== Recommendations by the Union ==

Page 29 of the report states: "This behavior by the administration violates the central premise of the [[scientific method]], and is therefore of particularly grave concern to the scientific community." It then goes on, in a short section titled "Conclusions and Recommendations: What's at Stake" at the end of the report, to provide recommendations for "restoring scientific integrity to federal policymaking" (page 30). These recommendations (on pages 30–31) include a suggestion for the [[President of the United States]] to issue [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]]s, and other actions, that would prevent further "abuse"; for the [[United States Congress]] to hold appropriate [[Hearing (law)|hearing]]s, consider the consequences of [[statutory law]] under its influence, increase the amount of publicly available scientific information, and establish an organization to guide Congress in its deliberations in technical matters; for scientists to raise awareness of the aforementioned issues and provide public policy recommendations; for the public to exercise its political influence in a constructive manner.

== Response ==
On April 2, 2004, the [[White House Office of Science and Technology Policy]] issued a statement by [[John Marburger|Dr. John Marburger]], the director of OSTP, that claims the descriptions of the incidents in the UCS report are all "false," "wrong," or "a distortion." He said he was disappointed with the report and dismissed it as "biased."[https://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,62339,00.html].

The objective of security sector reform (SSR) is to achieve good security sector governance (SSG)—where security actors are effective and accountable to their people. For example, SSR might guide decision-making on what form should the oversight of armed forces take or how transparent will intelligence agencies be according to legislation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2151(2014)|title=UN Security Council Resolution 2151 (S/RES/2151) on Security sector reform: challenges and opportunities|last=|first=|publisher=United Nations|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121073122/http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S%2FRES%2F2151%282014%29|archivedate=2017-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different nomenclature of the same overall framework include '''security system reform''' ('''SSR'''), '''security sector reconstruction''' ('''SSR''') and '''justice and security sector reform''' ('''JSSR''').&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dcaf.ch/sites/default/files/publications/documents/DCAF_BG_2_Security%20Sector%20Reform.pdf|title=Security Sector Reform: Applying the principles of good governance to the security sector|last=|first=|publisher=DCAF|year=2015|isbn=|series=SSR Backgrounder Series|location=Geneva|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913183845/http://www.dcaf.ch/sites/default/files/publications/documents/DCAF_BG_2_Security%20Sector%20Reform.pdf|archivedate=2017-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1994, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) adopted a Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security stating that the democratic control of the security sector as essential to stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.osce.org/fsc/41355?download=true|title=Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security|last=|first=|publisher=OSCE|year=1994|isbn=|location=Vienna|pages=3|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829145812/http://www.osce.org/fsc/41355?download=true|archivedate=2017-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A framework for security sector reform (SSR) emerged in 1999 after [[international development]] actors observed from examples in [[South Africa]], [[Indonesia]] and countries in Eastern Europe that national security and its components were considered crucial in a state recovering from [[War|conflict]] or an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian regime]]. Reportedly, the increasing number of [[Civil war|civil wars]] led development actors to look at the problem of insecurity from the perspective of good governance. The conclusion was that the security sector should adhere to the same rules of good governance as any other public service to curb conflict and violence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.clingendael.nl/publication/ssr-securing-its-success-justifying-its-relevance|title=SSR: Securing its success, justifying its relevance|last=Price|first=Megan|date=2014-08-19|work=Clingendael|access-date=|last2=van Veen|first2=Erwin|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826234737/https://www.clingendael.nl/publication/ssr-securing-its-success-justifying-its-relevance|archivedate=2017-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[United Nations Security Council]] (UNSC) adopted its first stand-alone resolution on SSR and within it the role of security sector reform in stabilizing post-conflict countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sc11369.doc.htm|title=Unanimously Adopting Resolution 2151 (2014), Security Council Underscores Need for National Ownership of Security-Sector Reform|last=|first=|date=2014-04-28|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820151018/http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sc11369.doc.htm|archivedate=2017-08-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/articles/2015/02/13/undp-sees-security-sector-reform-as-foundation-for-peace-and-development-.html|title=UNDP sees Security Sector Reform as foundation for Peace and Development|last=|first=|date=2015-02-13|website=UNDP|language=en|access-date=2017-08-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826000511/http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/articles/2015/02/13/undp-sees-security-sector-reform-as-foundation-for-peace-and-development-.html|archivedate=2017-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Female police officer of Denmark.jpg|thumb|The [[Service quality|quality of the service]] provided by the police, such as the pictured [[Police of Denmark]], is a component of security sector governance and reform]]There is no single globally accepted definition of security sector reform (SSR), but it generally refers to a process to reform or rebuild a state's [[National security|security sector]] towards good security sector governance (SSG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/sites/devco/files/joint-communication-ssr-20160705-p1-854572_en.pdf|title=Elements for an EU-wide strategic framework to support security sector reform, JOIN(2016) 31 final|last=|first=|publisher=European Commission|year=2016|isbn=|location=Strasbourg|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825234526/https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/sites/devco/files/joint-communication-ssr-20160705-p1-854572_en.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/115810.pdf|title=Security Sector Reform|last=|first=|publisher=USAID, US Departments of Defense and State|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107024030/https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/115810.pdf|archivedate=2017-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good SSG is usually defined as a number of idealized principles and good practices of a healthy security sector servicing its people. Likewise, the objective of SSR is defined as the application of the same principles of [[good governance]] to the security sector as to any other public sector service delivery, such as [[public health]] or [[education]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dcaf.ch/about-ssgr|title=About SSG/R|last=|first=|date=|website=DCAF (Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces)|language=en|access-date=2017-11-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107012716/http://dcaf.ch/about-ssgr|archivedate=2017-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) of the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (]]OECD) has defined four standards that SSR should strive for:&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Establishment of effective governance, oversight and accountability in the security system; 2) improved delivery of security and justice services; 3) development of local leadership and ownership of the reform process; and 4) sustainability of justice and security service delivery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The target of SSR are the components of the state that uphold [[national security]]. Although the security sector is therefore a wide term open to interpretation, it is generally used to describe the structures, institutions and personnel responsible for the management, provision and oversight of security in a certain country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/publications/ssr/ssr_perspective_2012.pdf|title=The United Nations SSR Perspective|last=|first=|publisher=UN SSR Unit|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519215426/http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/publications/ssr/ssr_perspective_2012.pdf|archivedate=2017-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the scope and target of SSR has usually been defined comprising the following four groups:
* Core security actors, such as armed forces, police, gendarmerie, border guards, customs and immigration, and intelligence and security services;
* security management and oversight bodies, such as ministries of defence and internal affairs, financial management bodies and public complaints commissions;
* justice and law enforcement institutions, such as the judiciary, prisons, prosecution services, traditional justice systems; and
* non-statutory security forces, such as private security companies, guerrilla armies and private militia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.eda.admin.ch/content/dam/deza/en/documents/themen/fragile-kontexte/224402-oecd-handbook-security-system-reform_EN.pdf|title=The OECD DAC Handbook on Security System Reform (SSR) - Supporting Security and Justice|last=|first=|publisher=OECD DAC|year=2007|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821172956/https://www.eda.admin.ch/content/dam/deza/en/documents/themen/fragile-kontexte/224402-oecd-handbook-security-system-reform_EN.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/%28httpAssets%29/904B9EE812B7591FC12573F400322816/$file/Joint+Seminar_A-62-659_S-2008-39.pdf|title=Securing peace and development: the role of the United Nations in supporting security sector reform - Report of the Secretary-General (A/62/659)|last=|first=|publisher=United Nations|year=2008|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905032133/http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/(httpAssets)/904B9EE812B7591FC12573F400322816/$file/Joint+Seminar_A-62-659_S-2008-39.pdf|archivedate=2014-09-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fba.se/en/how-we-work/security-sector-reform/|title=Security Sector Reform|last=|first=|date=|work=Folke Bernadotte Academy|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826130304/https://fba.se/en/how-we-work/security-sector-reform/|archivedate=2016-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objective ==
[[File:SSG and SSR.png|thumb|A diagram of the relationship between security sector reform and governance relative to time and quality|left]]To observe and measure the quality of SSG as well as set more definite objectives, [[international development]] actors generally break down good security sector governance into different principless that are believed to showcase different subparts of a healthy security sector under democratic control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unescap.org/resources/what-good-governance|title=What is Good Governance?|last=|first=|date=2009-06-10|website=United Nations ESCAP|language=en|access-date=2017-04-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423153306/http://www.unescap.org/resources/what-good-governance|archivedate=2017-04-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While exact configurations vary, some of the most common principles or objectives of good SSG that are commonly used include [[accountability]], [[rule of law]], and [[effectiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.osce.org/secretariat/231176|title=Security Sector Governance and Reform: Guidelines for OSCE Staff|last=|first=|publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)|year=2016|isbn=|location=Vienna|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825185357/http://www.osce.org/secretariat/231176|archivedate=2017-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Thomas G.|date=2000-10-01|title=Governance, good governance and global governance: Conceptual and actual challenges|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/713701075|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=21|issue=5|pages=795–814|doi=10.1080/713701075|issn=0143-6597}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A multitude of different practical situations of good SSG exist according to development actors: For example, in a security sector lead by good governance, the [[use of force]] is defined by a legal framework. This subsequently requires, among others, that publicly transparent [[law]]s are in place; oversight and [[separation of powers]] mechanisms are established and working; and the state's [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] use of force is regulated through strategies and policies.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An operational level example would be improved and open interaction between the public and the security sector, including functioning [[freedom of information]] and [[complaint]] institutes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

SSR is aimed at the existence of both national security and [[human security]]. However, the goals of providing national and human security can be conflictual in the context of conflict-torn societies which lack the framework of democratic governance. According to Florian Weigand, the experiences of SSR in [[Afghanistan]], for example, have prompted a debate on the advantages of providing human rather than state security in the process of state-building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/internationalDevelopment/pdf/WP/WP135.pdf|title=How can security sector reforms contribute to State-Building?

==Implementation==

SSR is not understood by researchers to be limited to a single political situation, but rather can be introduced in various contexts. The circumstances under which reform efforts are undertaken are often classified as three different reform environments: post-conflict, [[Provisional government|transitional]] and [[Developed country|developed countries]]. Nevertheless, security sector reform is most commonly introduced in post-conflict settings after [[war]] has ceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dcaf.ch/security-governance-post-conflict-peacebuilding|title=Security Governance in Post-Conflict Peacebuilding|last=Bryden|first=Alan|last2=Hänggi|first2=Heiner|publisher=Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF)|year=2005|isbn=978-3-8258-9019-3|location=Geneva|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915024200/http://www.dcaf.ch/security-governance-post-conflict-peacebuilding|archivedate=2017-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its insensitive application to such contexts has raised criticism. For example, Jane Chanaa has argued that there is a concept–context divide because conceptualisation overshadowed the understanding on how the idea adapts to the local situations whereas Safal Ghimire has noted that such a chasm exists also because the 'SSR' concept does not talk about reforms in the benefactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chanaa, Jane.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38809">'''Senior dog food diets''' are [[pet food]]s that are catered toward the senior or mature pet population. The senior [[dog]] population consists of dogs that are over the age of seven for most dog breeds,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; though in general large and giant breed dogs tend to reach this life stage earlier when compared to smaller breed dogs who are considered senior at a much later age. Senior dog foods contain nutrients and characteristics that are used to improve the health of the aging dog. [[Aging in dogs]] causes many changes to occur physiologically that will require a change in nutrient composition of their diet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laflamme|first=Dorthy|date=May 2005|title=Nutrition for Aging Cats and Dogs and the Importance of Body Condition|url=https://ac-els-cdn-com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/S0195561604001871/1-s2.0-S0195561604001871-main.pdf?_tid=d0e74ada-ba60-11e7-9d4f-00000aacb35f&amp;acdnat=1509031244_1d1d81a201707fe80bac30e75e283d30|journal=Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice|volume=35|pages=713–742|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major change that occurs is the decrease in energy requirements&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which is addressed by lowered caloric content of senior pet foods. Although energy requirements decrease, protein requirements increase as the dog ages. Senior dog foods include a higher [[protein]] content as well as highly digestible protein sources to deal with this. Nutrients included for joint and bone health include [[glucosamine]], [[chondroitin]], [[Omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3]] fatty acids as well as two main minerals; [[calcium]] and [[phosphorus]]. Sources of [[fiber]] included in senior dog foods include [[beet pulp]] and [[flax seed]] as well as [[fructooligosaccharide]]s (FOS) and mannanoligosaccharides (MOS). These act to increase gastrointestinal health. Brain and cognitive health decline as the dog ages which leads to the inclusion of [[vitamin E]] and [[L-carnitine]] in senior dog diets to combat this decline. Skin and coat health can also decline in older dogs due to various reasons.&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt; The inclusion of [[linoleic acid]] as well as [[vitamin A]] into senior dog diets helps to improve or maintain the skin and coat of senior dogs. Immune system health is important to maintain in older dogs to prevent the development of various diseases. By including omega-3 and [[Omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6]] fatty acids, vitamin E, [[Beta-Carotene|β-carotene]] as well as [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|pre]]- and [[Probiotic|pro-biotics]], the immune system can be boosted and maintained to help improve overall health. &lt;nowiki/&gt;

== Energy demand ==
The maintenance energy requirement (MER), or the energy that is required to maintain normal activity, decreases significantly as a result of [[lean body mass]] loss in aging dogs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The MER can decrease by up to 25% as dogs age due to this loss.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cliniciansbrief.com/sites/default/files/attachments/Nutrition%20for%20Senior%20Dogs.pdf|title=Nutrition for senior dogs: New tricks for feeding old dogs|last=Churchill|first=Julia A.|date=2015|website=Clinician's Brief|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basal metabolic rate is maintained by lean mass energy expenditure, which accounts for 96% of the function of lean mass.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The [[metabolizable energy]], or the amount of available energy which is left after the losses in urine, feces and combustible gas is subtracted, can be found on the food bag or calculated using the modified Atwater equation:

ME (kcal/kg) = 10[(3.5 x Crude Protein) + (8.5 x Crude Fiber) + (3.5 x Nitrogen Free Extract)]

This equation takes into consideration the amount of energy availability from [[crude protein]], crude [[fiber]], and the nitrogen free extract from pet foods in order to calculate the amount of energy the animal is receiving from the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall J.A., Melendez L.D. and Jewell D.E.|first=|date=2013|title=Using gross energy improves metabolizable energy predictive equations for pet foods whereas undigested protein and fiber content predict stool quality|url=|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|pages=1–8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to consider the metabolizable energy content of senior or mature pet foods using this equation, as energy requirements will vary with age.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=1+2244&amp;aid=2842|title=Metabolizable energy and caloric density|last=|first=|date=|website=Pet education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protein ==
{{Main|Protein (nutrient)}}
A dog's requirements for protein increases as a result of a reduced ability to synthesize proteins as it ages.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  As a result, it is extremely important to not restrict protein consumption to a senior dog as it can be as just as harmful as protein deficiency in young dogs.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; To ensure good health, it is important to provide dogs with the 22 amino acids which they require. Of these 22 amino acids, 12 can be synthesized. The rest must be provided by good sources of dietary protein in adequate quantities. Good sources of protein include eggs and fish, which have a high biological value. This value describes the percentage of usable amino acids within the protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://happydogfood.com/blogs/news/dietary-protein-for-dogs-and-cats-the-importance-of-digestible-proteins|title=Dietary protein for dogs and cats - the importance of digestible proteins|last=|first=|date=November 8, 2016|website=Happy Dog Food|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been recommended that a minimum of 2.55 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight should be fed daily to ensure that protein requirements are met.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; It is important to understand that protein requirements based on weight are variable and that many factors influence the protein requirements of each senior dog.

== Bone and joint health ==

Joint deterioration occurs as dogs age. As their joints become less lubricated there is increased friction between the [[bone]] and the [[cartilage]]. With this increased friction, the cartilage deteriorates and wears away. The reduction of this cushion in the joints causes bone-on-bone contact to occur, causing the animal great discomfort. This can cause various related issues such as altered gaits and changes in activity levels resulting in a greater possibility of obesity and other conditions related to mobility and activity levels.

There has been research done in human medicine that indicates the positive effect that a combination of chondroitin sulphate and glucosamine can have on moderate-to-severe knee pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clegg|first=Daniel O.|last2=Reda|first2=Domenic J.|last3=Harris|first3=Crystal L.|last4=Klein|first4=Marguerite A.|last5=O'Dell|first5=James R.|last6=Hooper|first6=Michele M.|last7=Bradley|first7=John D.|last8=Bingham|first8=Clifton O. III|last9=Weisman|first9=Michael H.|date=2006-02-23|title=Glucosamine, Chondroitin Sulfate, and the Two in Combination for Painful Knee Osteoarthritis|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=354|issue=8|pages=795–808|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa052771|issn=0028-4793|pmid=16495392|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/7zw280cw}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is likely very similar to the effect these two ingredients have on the joints of aging dogs. It is important to note the effects of these supplements is not instant and the aforementioned studies showed approximately a 3-month period between the beginning of supplementation and the reduction of symptoms.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arthritis.org/living-with-arthritis/treatments/natural/supplements-herbs/glucosamine-chondroitin-osteoarthritis.php|title=Glucosamine and Chrondroitin for Arthritis|website=www.arthritis.org|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Glucosamine ===
{{Main|Glucosamine}}
Glucosamine is a building block for the synthesis of cartilage tissue.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-articles/understanding-dog-food/what-is-chicken-meal-in-dog-food|title=What is Chicken Meal in Dog Food? - Purina® {{!}} Purina|website=www.purina.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found naturally in the body, mainly in the [[Synovial fluid|fluid which surrounds the joints]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This can help aging joints by maintaining the cartilage, thus reducing the pain caused by bone-on-bone contact within the joint (this is the primary source of joint pain in aging animals). This will increase the mobility of the dog which is vital for the maintenance of a healthy weight and general body function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vet-organics.com/blogs/news/pet-joint-care-part-two|title=What You Need To Know About Pet Joint Care: Part Two|work=Vet Organics|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been some studies which have showed [[anti-inflammatory]] properties of glucosamine which would also help joint function in aging dogs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Glucosamine is usually provided in supplements in the form of glucosamine sulfate, or by the inclusion of chicken meal in the diet, as it contains glucosamine as well as chondroitin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nutro.ca/en/natural-dog-food/nutro/dry/large-breed-senior-chicken-whole-brown-rice-oatmeal-recipe.aspx|title=NUTRO™ WHOLESOME ESSENTIALS™  Large Breed Senior Farm-Raised Chicken, Brown Rice &amp; Sweet Potato Recipe|last=Nutro|website=www.nutro.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Chondroitin ===
{{Main|Chondroitin sulfate}}
Chondroitin is a major component in the composition of [[cartilage]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It helps the cartilage retain moisture, lubricating the joint and allowing ease of movement of the bone across the cartilage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This reduces the damage to the cartilage over time. Chondroitin is produced naturally in the body but older dogs can often benefit from a supplemental dose of chondroitin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Chondroitin is commonly supplied as a supplement in the form of [[chondroitin sulfate]].

=== Omega-3 fatty acids ===
{{Main|Omega-3 fatty acid}}
Omega-3 fatty acids include docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). These two fatty acids have been shown to improve gait score and lameness in dogs with [[osteoarthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roush|first=James K.|last2=Cross|first2=Alan R.|last3=Renberg|first3=Walter C.|last4=Dodd|first4=Chadwick E.|last5=Sixby|first5=Kristin A.|last6=Fritsch|first6=Dale A.|last7=Allen|first7=Timothy A.|last8=Jewell|first8=Dennis E.|last9=Richardson|first9=Daniel C.|title=Evaluation of the effects of dietary supplementation with fish oil omega-3 fatty acids on weight bearing in dogs with osteoarthritis|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|language=en|volume=236|issue=1|pages=67–73|doi=10.2460/javma.236.1.67|pmid=20043801|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Omega-3 fatty acid]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have also been shown to have noticeable anti-inflammatory properties. It is for this reason, among other benefits, that they are routinely included at supplemental levels in senior dog diets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wall|first=Rebecca|last2=Ross|first2=R Paul|last3=Fitzgerald|first3=Gerald F|last4=Stanton|first4=Catherine|date=2010-05-01|title=Fatty acids from fish: the anti-inflammatory potential of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids|journal=Nutrition Reviews|language=en|volume=68|issue=5|pages=280–289|doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2010.00287.x|pmid=20500789|issn=1753-4887}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good source of omega-3 fatty acids in dog foods include [[fish oil]]s and other fish sources (especially [[salmon]] and [[Herring as food|herring]]) as well as [[flax]]seed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skaervet.com/documents/Common%20Pet%20Food%20Ingredients.pdf|title=Common Pet Food Ingredients|last=|first=|date=October 31, 2017|website=Skaerv Veterinary Clinic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Calcium and phosphorus ===
{{Main|Calcium in biology}}	
{{Main|Phosphorus#Biological role}}
One of the most basic requirements of the aging dog’s body is the requirement for maintenance of their bones. In order for the bones to be able to heal from any injury or erosion, as well as maintain their strength to avoid these problem, they need a ready supply of calcium and phosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/calcium-supplements|title=Calcium Supplements|website=vca_corporate|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these are essential nutrients according to AAFCO guidelines, and should be included in a senior dog diet.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aafco.org/|title=The Association of American Feed Control Officials &gt; Home|website=www.aafco.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calcium]] and [[Phosphorus]] are also very valuable in the maintenance tooth health of dogs. In order for calcium to be properly absorbed into the body dogs will require another nutrient, [[vitamin D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parfitt|first=A. M.|last2=Gallagher|first2=J.

== Gastrointestinal health ==

=== Sources of Fiber ===

[[File:Sugar beet cossettes.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A bowl of sugar beet cossettes.|Beet pulp is a good source of insoluble fiber.]]

==== Beet pulp ====
{{Main|Beet pulp}}
Beet pulp is a common ingredient in dog diets as it is a very versatile and useful fiber source.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Canine and feline nutrition : a resource for companion animal professionals|last=|first=|date=2011|publisher=Mosby|others=Case, Linda P.|isbn=9780323066198|edition=3rd|location=Maryland Heights, Mo.|pages=421–422|oclc=664112342}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fahey|first=G|last2=Merchen|first2=N|last3=Corbin|first3=J|last4=Hamilton|first4=A|last5=Serbe|first5=K|last6=Lewis|first6=S|last7=Hirakawa|first7=D|date=1990|title=Dietary fiber for dogs: I. Effects of graded levels of dietary beet pulp on nutrient intake, digestability, metabolizable energy and digesta mean retention time|url=|journal=Journal of Animal Science|volume=68|pages=4221–4228|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beet pulp provides fiber to the diet which acts as a stool hardener and aids in lower tract “cleansing”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The composition of beet pulp is such that it is an [[Insoluble dietary fiber|insoluble]] and moderately fermentable fiber.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This means it can add bulk to the diet as well as moisture to the stool while also supplying the animal’s cells lining the intestine with energy due to the moderate fermentation that occurs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Flax seed ====
{{Main|Flax#Nutrition}}
Flax seed is the whole seed of the flax plant which contains both soluble and insoluble fiber.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skaervet.com/documents/Common%20Pet%20Food%20Ingredients.pdf|title=Common Pet Food Ingredients|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The insoluble fraction includes [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]], and [[lignin]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These components have a very good water binding capacity which aids in adding bulk into the diet of the dog.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This has varying benefits for dogs depending on their lifestyle. In some dogs, it aids in digestion by preventing [[constipation]], in others it acts to improve [[satiety]] and encourage weight loss.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adolphe|first=Jennifer|last2=Fitzpatrick|first2=Kelley|title=FLAXSEED: Nutrition Benefits for Dogs and Cats|url=https://flaxcouncil.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/FlaxFeed-Nutrition-Benefits-final.pdf|journal=Flax Council of Canada|volume=2|pages=1–4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flaxseed is also a good source of [[Omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3]] and [[Omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6]] fatty acids which have multiple health benefits for the animal such as improving coat quality.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Flax seed is also one of the richest sources of alpha [[linoleic acid]] (ALA).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; ALA can be converted by the dog to [[Docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]] and [[Eicosapentaenoic acid|EPA]] to carry out various functions in the body.

===  Fructooligosaccharides and mannanoligosaccharides ===
{{Main|Fructooligosaccharide}}
{{Main|Mannan oligosaccharide-based nutritional supplements}}
[[Fructooligosaccharide]]s, commonly known as FOS, consist of many different types of indigestible [[oligosaccharide]]s.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swanson, K.S., Grieshop, C.M., Flickinger, E.A., Bauer, L.L., Healy, HP., Dawson K.A., Merchen N.R. and Fahey G.G. Jr.|first=|date=May 2002|title=Supplemental fructooligosaccharides and mannanoligosaccharides influence immune function, ileal and total tract nutrient digestibilities, microbial populations and concentrations of protein catabolites in the large bowel of dogs|url=http://jn.nutrition.org.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/content/132/5/980.short|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|volume=132|pages=980–989|via=The Journal of Nutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt; FOS is shown to be beneficial in providing a source of energy for the good gut bacteria in dogs.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; [[Mannan oligosaccharide-based nutritional supplements|Mannanoligosaccharides]] are also known as MOS which also have an effect on the overall gut health in dogs.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; These compounds both contain oligosaccharides however; they work in different manners. Constipation prevention and treatment can be carried out by the supplementation of FOS by its subsequent effect on gut bacteria.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; MOS works in a different manner by effecting the attachment of bad bacteria in the gut of the dog.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; These bad bacteria attach to the [[epithelial lining]] of the gastrointestinal tract and can cause the beginnings of [[pathogenic disease]]s.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; MOS works to counteract these by preventing the binding of these deleterious bacteria.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

A study carried out in dogs determined that these two compounds when supplemented together can help with overall immune function.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This is due to the decrease in overall bad bacteria and an increase in good bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. These two compounds also were not found to have any detrimental effects on food consumption, stool quality or stool output.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Brain and cognitive health ==
A dogs brain undergoes many pathological changes during the aging process. Some of these changes can include damage to the [[DNA]] (deoxyribonucleic acid), a decrease in the amount of [[myelin]] overlay on nerve cells as well as a buildup of [[protein]] in the brain which can potentially have toxic effects.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Due to these physiological changes senior and aging dog can have possible impairment of proper cognition.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roudebush|first=Philip|last2=Zicker|first2=Steven C.|last3=Cotman|first3=Carl W.|last4=Milgram|first4=Norton W.|last5=Muggenburg|first5=Bruce A.|last6=Head|first6=Elizabeth|date=2005-09-01|title=Nutritional management of brain aging in dogs|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|volume=227|issue=5|pages=722–728|doi=10.2460/javma.2005.227.722|issn=0003-1488}}&lt;/ref&gt; This impairment can include complex learning tasks as well as memory issues.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Vitamin E ===
{{Main|Vitamin E}}
The addition of Vitamin E as an [[antioxidant]] in senior dog food can have a positive effect on brain and cognitive health. Vitamin E is a [[Fat-soluble vitamin|fat soluble vitamin]] which works to prevent [[oxidative damage]] from occurring.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; [[Reactive oxygen species]] can develop in the brain and can have a harmful effect by causing oxidative stress on the tissues if they are not subdued by antioxidants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxidative Stress and Free Radical Damage in Neurology|last=Gadoth and Gobel|first=Nathan and Hans|publisher=Humana Press|year=2011|isbn=9781603275149|location=Totowa, New Jersey|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitochondrial aerobic metabolism is thought to be the largest source of reactive oxidative species.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; As the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] age their function declines which causes an increase in the production of oxidative species.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Studies carried out in aging dogs looking at the effects of antioxidant supplemented diets have shown that older dogs supplemented with antioxidants including Vitamin E were able to correctly perform tasks more often than senior dogs whose diets were not supplemented.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It has also been shown that in senior dogs consuming these antioxidant enriched diets there was an increase in positive behavioural actions during the feeding period compared to senior dogs consuming diets that were not supplemented.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== L-carnitine ===
{{Main|Carnitine}}
L-carnitine is an [[amino acid]] and precursor of [[Acetylcarnitine|acetyl-L-carnitine]] which is a mitochondrial cofactor.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It acts to help with overall mitochondrial function as well as [[lipid metabolism]] which is an important function of mitochondria.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This is important as an increase in mitochondrial function will help to reduce the rates of oxidative reactions in the brain which overall decrease damage to DNA  and stimulates better cognitive function.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Skin and coat health ==
Several physiological changes in the senior pet can lead to a decline in skin and coat health.&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bellows|first=Jan|last2=Colitz|first2=Carmen M. H.|last3=Daristotle|first3=Leighann|last4=Ingram|first4=Donald K.|last5=Lepine|first5=Allan|last6=Marks|first6=Stanley L.|last7=Sanderson|first7=Sherry Lynn|last8=Tomlinson|first8=Julia|last9=Zhang|first9=Jin|date=2014-12-17|title=Common physical and functional changes associated with aging in dogs|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|volume=246|issue=1|pages=67–75|doi=10.2460/javma.246.1.67|pmid=25517328|issn=0003-1488}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these changes include a loss of elasticity in the skin which leads to wrinkling, [[hair follicle]] atrophy which can cause hair loss, a decrease in oil secretion which can lead to dry and flaky skin as well as a loss of [[melanocyte]]s which causes the loss of pigmentation of the hair follicles.&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt; Skin and coat health is one of most noticeable aging changes due to the fact that it results in a change in appearance of the senior dog. Skin and coat health are important to upkeep as dogs age and there are many components in senior dog foods that can benefit this important area of health.

=== Linoleic acid ===
{{Main|Linoleic acid}}
Linoleic acid is a [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]] that is classified as an [[Omega-6 fatty acid|omega 6-fatty acid]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Straus M.|first=|date=November 2012|title=Plant oils: do you know which plant oils may help your dog, and which ones could cause problems?|url=http://go.galegroup.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/ps/i.do?&amp;id=GALE%7CA308130839&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=guel77241&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;authCount=1|journal=Whole Dog Journal|volume=15|pages=16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linoleic acid plays an important role in the maintenance of the water barrier of skin.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This helps prevent the dryness and scaly skin that occurs during the aging process. [[Omega-6 fatty acid|Omega 6-fatty acids]] can also have a slight [[Anti-inflammatory|anti-imflammatory]] role.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Good sources of linoleic acid to look for in senior dog foods include [[corn oil]], [[soybean oil]] and poultry fat.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Vitamin A ===
{{Main|Vitamin A}}
Vitamin A is a [[Vitamin|fat soluble vitamin]] that aids in the [[keratinization]] process of hair.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Tim D.G.|date=1998|title=Diet and Skin Disease in Dogs and Cats|url=http://jn.nutrition.org.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/content/128/12/2783S.full.pdf+html|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|volume=128|pages=2783–2789|via=The Journal of Nutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is important in maintaining a healthy coat in the aging dog and preventing the deterioration of [[epithelial tissue]]s.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Dogs do not directly need a source of Vitamin A as they can convert [[Beta-Carotene|beta-carotene]] (a precursor to Vitamin A) into Vitamin A.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; However, Vitamin A supplementation in senior dog diets can assist senior dogs in maintaining their coats as their [[Sebaceous gland|sebaceous]] activity and skin elasticity decrease. Vitamin A supplements can be included in senior dogs diets however there are also other good sources of Vitamin A. These include [[milk]], [[Yolk|egg yolk]], and [[Liver (food)|liver]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The inactive form of Vitamin A, beta-carotene can be found in high amounts in [[carrot]]s.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Vitamin E===
{{Main|Vitamin E}} Vitamin E is a key component found in dog foods for the skin to maintain elasticity and to replace old skin cells.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plevnin Kapun|first=A|last2=Salobir|first2=J|last3=Levart|first3=A|last4=Tavčar Kalcher|first4=G|last5=Nemec Svete|first5=A|last6=Kotnik|first6=T|year=2014|title=Vitamin E supplementation in canine atopic dermatitis: improvement of clinical signs and effects on oxidative stress markers|url=|journal=Veterinary Record|volume=175|issue=22|pages=560|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the anti-oxidant mechanisms of vitamin E it can prevent the formation of free radicals and in turn may prevent cancer cells from proliferating in senior dogs.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Vitamin E is found in both plant and animal products such as vegetable oil, dark red vegetables and liver.

=== Zinc ===
{{Main|Zinc}}Zinc is among one of many trace minerals recommended for dogs of all ages.&lt;ref name=":1122"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marsh|first=K.|last2=Coe|first2=S.|last3=Ruedisueli|first3=F.|last4=Watson|first4=T.|date=2000|title=Effects of zinc and linoleic acid supplementation on the skin and coat quality of dogs receiving a complete and balanced diet|journal=Veterinary Dermatology|volume=11|issue=4|pages=277–284|doi=10.1046/j.1365-3164.2000.00202.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs experience loss of elasticity and dryness of the skin as they age.&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt; The addition of zinc in the diet aids in the development of collagen and wound healing, and also will prevent the skin from becoming dry and flaky.&lt;ref name=":1122" /&gt; Senior dogs can obtain zinc in their diet through the addition of various ingredients, including; red meats, whole grains, poultry by-product meals, and fish meals.

=== Copper ===
{{Main|Copper}}Loss of hair pigmentation is a common concern for senior dogs.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt; Copper has been shown to improve coat conditions by reducing dry skin and improving the overall pigmentation of the coat.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tewari, D.; Singh, V.K.; Gautam, S.; Dwivedi, V.|first=|date=December 2013|title=Nutritional dermatosis - a review|url=|journal=Intas Polivet|volume=14|pages=199–202|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, copper may able to delay the natural aging process of the whitening of a dog's coat.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

===&amp;nbsp;Riboflavin ===
{{Main|Riboflavin}}
Senior dogs require a larger amount of riboflavin for maintenance compared to adult dogs. Vitamin B2, also known as riboflavin, plays an important role as a cofactor for the [[Carbohydrate metabolism|metabolism of carbohydrates]]. Riboflavin is required in the diet to prevent cracking and dry skin, as well as a darkening of the pigmentation of skin.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spies|first=Tom D.|date=1943|title=The Natural Occurrence of Riboflavin Deficiency in the Eyes of Dogs|jstor=1671149|journal=Science|volume=98|issue=2547|pages=369–370|doi=10.2307/1671149|doi-broken-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riboflavin is also important for the vision of the senior dog as deficiencies can cause alterations in blood supply to the [[cornea]] which may lead to impaired vision and potential blindness.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; A source of riboflavin in senior dog diets is important to help prevent changes that aging can cause on skin.

== Immune system health ==
[[Immune system|Immune functions]] start to decline due to compromised ability to efficiently produce various [[protein]]s and cells that are important for the body's defense system as dogs age. [[Free radicals]] can cause [[oxidative stress]], killing the cells or impairing the functional capability of the cells, which leads to weakening of the [[immune system]].&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Puertollano|first1=Maria A.|last2=Puertollano|first2=Elena|last3=Alvarez de Cienfuegos|first3=Gerardo|last4=de Pablo|first4=Manuel A.|title=Dietary Antioxidants: Immunity and Host Defense|journal=Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry|date=1 July 2011|volume=11|issue=14|pages=1752–1766|doi=10.2174/156802611796235107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, providing dietary [[antioxidants]] can be an effective method to prevent the oxidative stress and support the immune system.

=== Ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids ===
{{Main|Omega-3 fatty acid#Omega−6 to omega−3 ratio}}
[[Omega-6]] and [[omega-3]] fatty acids are very important for a strong healthy immune system and for preventing [[chronic disease]] in dogs. It is crucial in pet diets that the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids is properly balanced in order to achieve optimal health.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wander|first=R. C.|last2=Hall|first2=J. A.|last3=Gradin|first3=J. L.|last4=Du|first4=S. H.|last5=Jewell|first5=D.

It is recommended to have a ratio of 5:1 to 10:1, with there being more omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3's. AAFCO has a maximum ratio listed of 30:1.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; For ideal health and decreased risk of low-grade chronic inflammation, it is more beneficial to have a lower ratio versus a higher one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein and Amino ACids (Macronutrients).|last=|first=|publisher=National Academy Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Washington D.C.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omega-3 fatty acids have [[anti-inflammatory]] properties and therefore need to be supplemented in a closer ratio to omega-6's which are more [[Inflammation|inflammatory]].&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simopoulos|first=Artemis P.|date=2002-12-01|title=Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Inflammation and Autoimmune Diseases|journal=Journal of the American College of Nutrition|volume=21|issue=6|pages=495–505|doi=10.1080/07315724.2002.10719248|issn=0731-5724|pmid=12480795}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all of the omega-3 fatty acids that could be used, the most potent are found in [[fish oil]] in the forms of [[Eicosapentaenoic acid|EPA]] and [[Docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]], these have the highest immunomodulatory activities.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Omega-3 fatty acids tend to increase [[antioxidant]] requirements because they oxidize so rapidly, therefore when they are in a closer ratio to omega-6 fatty acids, as recommended, antioxidants must also be supplemented in the diet.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

=== Vitamin E ===
{{Main|Vitamin E}}
Vitamin E is an antioxidant that can be supplemented in the diet in order to strengthen the effect of [[fatty acid]] supplementations.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; This vitamin works to decrease the production of pro-inflammatory markers that are found in [[synovial fluid]] of the [[joints]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rhouma|first=Mohamed|last2=de Oliveira El Warrak|first2=Alexander|last3=Troncy|first3=Eric|last4=Beaudry|first4=Francis|last5=Chorfi|first5=Younès|date=2013|title=Anti-inflammatory response of dietary vitamin E and its effects on pain and joint structures during early stages of surgically induced osteoarthritis in dogs|journal=Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research|volume=77|issue=3|pages=191–198|issn=0830-9000|pmc=3700444|pmid=24101795}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of this antioxidant, chronic inflammation can be avoided which aids senior dogs in maintaining a healthier immune system as well as helping to ease the symptoms of [[osteoarthritis]]. Also, formation of [[Hydrogen peroxide|{{chem|H|2|O|2}}]], which is a [[reactive oxygen species]] that suppress [[lymphocyte]] proliferation, can be decreased by vitamin E.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Jean A.|last2=Tooley|first2=Katie A.|last3=Gradin|first3=Joseph L.|last4=Jewell|first4=Dennis E.|last5=Wander|first5=Rosemary C.|title=Effects of dietary n-6 and n-3 fatty acids and vitamin E on the immune response of healthy geriatric dogs|journal=American Journal of Veterinary Research|date=June 2003|volume=64|issue=6|pages=762–772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===β-Carotene===
{{Main|beta-Carotene}}
[[Beta-carotene]] can be found in certain vegetables and it is a highly potent [[antioxidants]]. The number of [[T-cells]] is naturally decreased with age, leading to compromised immune function.

{{unreferenced|date=June 2012}}
A '''swing-door operator''' (or '''swing-door opener''' or '''automatic swing-door operator''') is a device that operates a [[swing door]] for pedestrian use. It opens or helps open the door automatically, waits, then closes it.

== Types ==
There are 3 basic types of swing door operators:
* Full Energy – It opens and closes the door at full speed.
* Low Energy – It opens and closes the door at reduced speed to limit the kinetic energy of the moving door to levels deemed safe for disabled users.
* Power Assist – This is a version of the low-energy operator. It doesn't open the door; instead, it lets the user open the door manually at a reduced force, compared to opening against a standard [[door closer]]. It closes the door with the same speed limitations as a low-energy operator.

== Uses ==
Full Energy operators are typically used on the outside doors of medium-sized retail business. (Larger retail businesses prefer [[sliding door operator]]s.)
Low Energy operators are typically used where a simple door closer is sufficient for able users, yet it is necessary to add access to disabled users: small businesses, apartments, bathrooms.

== Triggering ==
A door operator may be triggered in various ways:
* Approach sensor (such as a radar sensor in the form of a [[Gunn diode]] and [[Waveguide]]) – the door opens when a user approaches it.
* Pushbutton – the door opens when a user presses a button.
* Push-&amp;-go – the door opens fully when the user begins opening it.
* Access control – the door opens when an [[access control|access control system]] determines the user is authorized to go through.
A trigger from any of the above requests that the door be opened (or reopened if it was closing). The operator will heed hat requests only after it is able to do so safely for any other users in the area.

== Safety sensors ==
A door operator may use sensors to prevent the door from coming into contact with a user.

Full Energy operators require at least 3 sensors. Low-energy operators are not required to have safety sensors, as the door is allowed to come in contact with a user, given that the kinetic energy of the moving door is limited by the reduced moving speed.

Historically, sensors have been simply floor mats that sense the weight of a user, one in the area immediately in front of the door (the approach side) and one in the area behind it (the swing side). The approach side mat is often used as a trigger sensor. The swing side mat prevents the door from starting to open as long as some other person is detected in the swing area; once the door starts opening, this mat is ignored, as it will sense the user going through.

Today, [[infrared safety sensor]]s or [[laser safety sensor]] are normally used. Four types are commonly used.
*Header mounted presence sensor – Mounted on the jamb above the door, on the approach side, it detects the presence of a person standing in front of the door.
*Approach side, door mounted sensor – Mounted on the approach side of the door itself, used as the door is closing to detect a user in the way of the closing door. Some safety sensor also safeguard the hinge area to protect hands and fingers during the closing process. In that case, the operator either stops the door or reopens it.
*Swing side, door mounted sensor – Mounted on the swing side of the door itself, used as the door is opening to detect a user in the way of the opening door. In that case, the operator stops the door. The sensitivity of infrared sensors must be reduced at the end of the opening angle, if it starts seeing a wall next to the door, so it may not confuse it with a user. Laser based sensors increase the safety by learning the surroundings of the door and dynamically adapt their detection fields to only ignore the wall next to the door.
*Safety beam – This beam crosses the path of the user past the swing side. If interrupted, the operator assumes that a person has crossed into the swing area, and it is not safe to open the door at full speed. This sensor is ignored once the door has started to open, as then the operator assumes that it is the user having gone through the door that has interrupted the beam.

[[File:Swing door.jpg|thumb|Typical swing door with a laser safety sensor]]

== Opening technologies ==
The majority of the operators open the door directly or through an arm.
* Overhead concealed mount – the operator is mounted above the door and rotates the door directly, through its pivot.
* Surface mount, push (scissor arm) – the operator is mounted on the wall above the door, on the approach side and pushes the door with a linkage of 2 arms.
* Surface mount, pull (track) – the operator is mounted on the wall above the door, on the swing side and pulls the door with an arm whose end slides in a track mounted on the door.

Variations on the above exist.
There are also rare operators that use a mechanism that is disconnected from the door, and reaches out and pushes on the door itself when it needs to open it.

== Internal technologies ==
Operators are powered by an [[electric motor]]. They differ in how they use the motor's energy to open the door.

[[Image:Swing door operator animation.gif|frame|right|Disengaging, closer-based, push-mount, electro-mechanical operator. View from above. Shades of blue: standard door closer. Shades of red: opener gears. Gold: motor.]]
Operators use various internal technologies.
* Some are built on top of a standard door closer. To open the door, the operator forces the closer in the opening direction. Then, the closer closes the door. The user may open the door manually, using just the door closer. In case of power failure while the door is open, the closer itself closes the door.
* Some are built without a door closer. The motor opens and closes the door through reducing [[gear]]s. The operator may or may not include a return [[Spring (device)|spring]] to close the door in case of power failure while the door is open.
Operators are often categorized by the means by which the motor's energy is applied.
* Electromechanical – the motor uses purely mechanical means to open the door: gears, cams, levers and such. This is the preferred type in the US.
* Electro-hydraulic – the motor drives a hydraulic pump, which pressurizes the oil in a door closer, which in turn turns the door closer and opens the door. This is the preferred type in Europe. (In the US it has a reputation of being prone to oil leaks.)
* Electro-pneumatic – the motor drives an air compressor and may be located away from the door. The air pressure is used to drive the operator above the door. This type is not common, and noise can be a factor if compressor is located close to a door. Typically, the compressor can be located up to 200 feet away ensuring that noise is not a factor.  A typical life expectancy of a pneaumtic system is 10–15 years except the compressor. Best application of a pneumatic system is in a residential environment where usage is limited to 30–40 times a day.

Of the electromechanical types, two approaches are used:
*Disengaging – the motor driven mechanism (the opener portion) is not joined to the closer, but only engages the closer when it is needed to open the door. When opening the door manually, the opener portion is still, so the opening is smooth and quiet.
*Permanently engaged – the motor driven mechanism (the opener portion) is always joined to the closer (if present) and to the door. When opening the door manually, the user is also driving the opener portion, so the opening is rough and noisy.
Electro-hydraulic types are inherently quiet and smooth during manual opening, as the motor and pump are off.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32568">'''[[Terraforming]]''' is well represented in [[popular culture]], usually in the form of [[science fiction]].&lt;ref name="Flatow"&gt;{{harvnb|Flatow|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pak"&gt;{{harvnb|Pak|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While many stories involving interstellar travel feature planets already suited to habitation by humans and supporting their own indigenous life, some authors prefer to address the unlikeliness of such a concept by instead detailing the means by which humans have converted inhospitable worlds to ones capable of supporting life through artificial means.

Author [[Jack Williamson]] is credited with inventing and popularizing the term "terraform".  In July 1942, under the pseudonym Will Stewart, Williamson published a science fiction [[novella]] entitled "[[Collision Orbit]]" in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science-Fiction]]'' magazine.  The series was later published as two novels, ''Seetee Shock'' (1949) and ''Seetee Ship'' (1951).&lt;ref name="Fogg_1995_16"&gt;{{harvnb|Fogg|1995|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  American [[geographer]] [[Richard Cathcart]] successfully lobbied for formal recognition of the verb "to terraform", and it was first included in the fourth edition of the [[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="Fogg_1995_9"&gt;{{harvnb|Fogg|1995|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terraforming of fictional planets in literature===
*[[H. G. Wells]] alludes to what today might be called ''xeno-terraforming'' - alien life altering Earth for their own benefit - in his 1898 novel ''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|The War of the Worlds]]''.  When the Martians arrive they bring with them a [[red weed]] that spreads and (temporarily) overpowers terrestrial vegetation.
*Terraforming is one of the basic concepts around which [[Frank Herbert]]'s [[Dune (novel)|Dune]] novels (1965-1985) are based: the [[Fremen]]'s obsession with converting the desert-world [[Arrakis]] to earthlike conditions supplies the fugitive [[Paul Atreides]] with a ready-made army of followers (In later books, the focus shifts to those trying to "arrakisform" earthlike planets to support the giant [[sandworm (Dune)|sandworm]]s and produce their desired 'spice' secretion). The Imperium's capital world [[Kaitain (Dune)|Kaitain]] has all its weather controlled by satellites. [[Pardot Kynes]], the Planetary Ecologist from [[Arrakis]] visited the world, and commented that the nature of the control meant it would eventually bring about disaster, which is why Arrakis should be terraformed through more natural processes.
*[[Roger MacBride Allen]]'s novel ''[[The Depths of Time]]'' (2000) features a fictional planet, Solace, on which terraforming is failing and bringing about climatic and [[ecological collapse]].
*[[Liz Williams]]' novel ''[[The Ghost Sister]]'' (2001) offers a critique of terraforming. The ruling elite of Irie St Syre, the [[Gaianism]] priestesses, believe that humanity has a right to adapt the climate and biosphere of planets to its own needs.  They send out emissaries to a lost colony, Monde d'Isle, who have adapted humanity to their planet, not the other way around.
*[[Laura J. Mixon]]'s novel ''Burning the Ice'' (2002) is set on an imagined frozen moon of [[47 Ursae Majoris b]] which is being terraformed by induced [[global warming]].
*''[[Building Harlequin's Moon]]'' (2005), by [[Larry Niven]] and [[Brenda Cooper]], shows the creation of a substantial moon by smashing several smaller moons together, and the very lengthy process of terraforming it over 60,000 years.
*[[Chris Moriarty]]'s novel ''Spin Control'' (2006) features a fictional planet, Novalis, on which terraforming is progressing in a speed and direction which defy scientific theory.
*In ''These Broken Stars'' by [[Amie Kaufman]], the protagonist, teenage Lilac LaRoux, lives a life of luxury due to her rich father who has financed the terraforming of several planets (such as Corinth) inside the fictional universe. The story focusses on Lilac and an army commander as they are the only survivors of a spaceship crash on a planet that appears to be in the process of terraforming but has been abandoned.

In the 1986 sequel, ''Aliens'', the planet has been terraformed using atmosphere processing equipment to an Earth-like state. The process is described as taking "decades," but is apparently so routine that the colonies responsible for it have earned the whimsical nicknamename "Shake N' Bake Colonies."  The Weyland Yutani corporation sports the phrase "Building Better Worlds" as its slogan, and it is implied that terraforming is a large part of its business.

|The original planet Earth (known in the series as "Earth-That-Was") "got used up," forcing most or all of humanity to find a new star system. In the new system, they terraformed - and apparently are still terraforming - many planets and moons. Each one has been terraformed with varying degrees of success; the inner planets boast a lush climate while the outer edges of the large solar system are populated by desolate, dry moons reminiscent of the [[American Old West|Wild West]], or can be, as in the case of St. Alban's (featured in the episode [[The Message (Firefly)|The Message]]), bitterly cold. The movie goes one step further by actually showing what terraforming might look like, as well as stating that the process took decades.  The series takes place in the early 26th century. Possibly of note is a mention in an early ''Firefly'' episode ("[[The Train Job]]") of "each [terraformed moon or planet] ha[ving] its... quirks," including environmentally-triggered diseases such as Bodin's Malady.

'''Theories on the [[causes of poverty]]''' are the foundation upon which [[poverty reduction]] strategies are based.

While in [[developed nations]] [[poverty]] is often seen as either a personal or a structural defect, in [[developing nations]] the issue of poverty is more profound due to the lack of governmental funds. Some theories on poverty in the developing world focus on [[cultural]] characteristics as a retardant of further development. Other theories focus on social and political aspects that perpetuate poverty; perceptions of the poor have a significant impact on the design and execution of programs to alleviate poverty.

== Causes of poverty in the United States==

===Poverty as a personal failing===
When it comes to [[poverty in the United States]], there are two main lines of thought. The most common line of thought within the U.S. is that a person is poor because of personal traits.&lt;ref name="rank_full"&gt;{{harvnb|Rank|Yoon|Hirschl|2003|pp=&lt;!-- full --&gt;3–29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These traits in turn have caused the person to fail. Supposed traits range from personality characteristics, such as laziness, to educational levels. Despite this range, it is always viewed as the individual's personal failure not to climb out of poverty. This thought pattern stems from the idea of [[meritocracy]] and its entrenchment within U.S. thought. Meritocracy, according to Katherine S. Newman is “the view that those who are worthy are rewarded and those who fail to reap rewards must also lack self-worth.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1999|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that all followers of meritocracy believe that a person in poverty deserves their low standard of living. Rather the underlying ideas of personal failure show in the resistance to social and economic programs such as welfare; a poor individual's lack of prosperity shows a personal failing and should not be compensated (or justified) by the state.

===Poverty as a structural failing===
[[#CITEREFRankYoonHershl2003|Rank, Yoon, and Hirschl (2003)]] present a contrary argument to the idea that personal failings are the cause of poverty. The argument presented is that United States poverty is result of “failings at the structural level.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rank|Yoon|Hirschl|2003|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Key social and economic structural failings which contribute heavily to poverty within the U.S. are identified in the article. The first is a failure of the job market to provide a proper amount of jobs which pay enough to keep families out of poverty. Even if unemployment is low, the labor market may be saturated with low-paying, part-time work that lacks benefits (thus limiting the amount of full-time, good paying jobs). Rank, Yoon and Hirschl examined the [[Survey of Income and Program Participation]] (SIPP), a longitudinal study on employment and income. Using the 1999 official poverty line of $17,029 for a family of four, it was found that 9.4% of persons working full-time and 14.9% of persons working at least part-time did not earn enough annually to keep them above the poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rank|Yoon|Hirschl|2003|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One study showed that 29% of families in The United States could go six months or longer during a hardship with no income. Over 50% of respondents said around two months with no income and another 20% said they could not go longer than two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hacker|first=Jacob S.|last2=Rehm|first2=Philipp|last3=Schlesinger|first3=Mark|date=2013-03-01|title=The Insecure American: Economic Experiences, Financial Worries, and Policy Attitudes|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1537592712003647|journal=Perspectives on Politics|volume=11|issue=01|pages=23–49|doi=10.1017/S1537592712003647|issn=1541-0986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low minimum wage, combined with part-time jobs which offer no benefits, have contributed to the labor market's inability to produce enough jobs which can keep a family out of poverty is an example of an economic structural failure.&lt;ref name="rank_full" /&gt;

Rank, Yoon and Hirschl point to the minimal amount of [[social safety net]]s found within the U.S. as a social structural failure and a major contributor to poverty in the U.S. Other industrialized nations devote more resources to assisting the poor than the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rank|Yoon|Hirschl|2003|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this difference poverty is reduced in nations which devote more to poverty reduction measure and programs. Rank et al. use a table to drive this point home. The table shows that in 1994, the actual rate of poverty (what the rate would be without government interventions) in the U.S. was 29%. When compared to actual rates in Canada (29%), Finland (33%), France (39%), Germany (29%), [[the Netherlands]] (30%), [[Norway]] (27%), [[Sweden]] (36%) and the [[United Kingdom]] (38%), the United States rate is low. But when government measures and programs are included, the rate of reduction in poverty in the United States is low (38%). [[Canada]] and the United Kingdom had the lowest reduction rates outside of the U.S. at 66%, while Sweden, Finland and Norway had reduction rates greater than 80% (All percentages taken from {{harvnb|Rank|Yoon|Hirschl|2003|p=17}}).

===Poverty as cultural characteristics===
Development plays a central role to poverty reduction in [[third world]] countries. Some authors feel that the national mindset itself plays a role in the ability for a country to develop and to thus reduce poverty. [[#CITEREFGrondona2000|Mariano Grondona (2000)]] outlines twenty “cultural factors” which, depending on the culture's view of each, can be indicators as to whether the cultural environment is favorable or resistant to development. In turn [[#CITEREFHarrison2000|Lawrence E. Harrison (2000)]] identifies ten “values” which, like Grondona's factors, can be indicative of the nation's developmental environment. Finally, [[#CITEREFLindsay2000|Stace Lindsay (2000)]] claims the differences between development-prone and development-resistant nations is attributed to mental models (which, like values, influence the decisions humans make). Mental models are also cultural creations. Grondona, Harrison and Lindsay all feel that without development orientated values and mindsets, nations will find it difficult if not impossible to develop efficiently, and that some sort of cultural change will be needed in these nations in order to reduce poverty.

In “A Cultural Typology of Economic Development”, from the book Culture Matters, Mariano Grondona claims development is a matter of decisions. These decisions, whether they are favorable to economic development or not, are made within the context of culture. All cultural values considered together create “value systems”. These systems heavily influence the way decisions are made as well as the reactions and outcomes of said decisions. In the same book, Stace Lindsay's chapter claims the decisions individuals make are a result of mental models. These mental models influence all aspects of human action. Like Grondona's value systems, these mental models which dictate a nations stance toward development and hence its ability to deal with poverty.

Grondona presents two ideal [[value system]]s (mental models), one of which has values only favoring development, the other only with value which resist development.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grondona|2000|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Real value systems fluctuate and fall somewhere between the two poles, but developed countries tend to bunch near one end, while [[undeveloped countries]] bunch near the other. Grondona goes on to identify twenty cultural factors on which the two value systems stand in opposition. These factors include such things as the dominant religion; the role of the individual in society; the value placed on work; concepts of wealth, competition, justice and time; and the role of education. In “Promoting Progressive Cultural Change”, also from Culture Matters, Lawrence E. Harrison identifies values, like Grondona's factors, which differ between “progressive” cultures and “static” cultures. Religion, value of work, overall justice and time orientation are included in his list, but Harrison also adds [[frugality]] and community as important factors. Like Grondona and Harrison, Lindsay also presents “patterns of thought” which differ between nations that stand at opposite poles of the developmental scale. Lindsay focuses more on economic aspects such as the form of capital focused upon and market characteristics. Key themes which emerge from these lists as characteristic of developmental cultures are: trust in the individual with a fostering of individual strengths; the ability for free thinking in an open, safe environment; importance of questioning/innovation; law is supreme and holds the power; future orientated time frame with an emphasis on achievable, practical goals; meritocracy; an autonomous mindset within the larger world; strong work ethic is highly valued and rewarded; a microeconomic focus; and a value that is non-economic, but not anti-economic, which is always wanting. Characteristics of the ideal non-developmental value system are: suppression of the individual through control of information and censorship; present/past time orientation with emphasis on grandiose, often unachievable, goals; [[macroeconomic]] focus; access to leaders allowing for easier and greater corruption; unstable distribution of law and justice (family and its connections matter most); and a passive mindset within the larger world.

Grondona, Harrison, and Lindsay all feel that at least some aspects of development-resistant cultures need to change in order to allow under-developed nations (and cultural minorities within developed nations) to develop effectively. According to their argument, poverty is fueled by cultural characteristics within under-developed nations, and in order for poverty to be brought under control, said nations must move down the development path.

===Poverty as a label===
Various theorists believe the way poverty is approached, defined, and thus thought about, plays a role in its perpetuation. [[#CITEREFGreen2006|Maia Green (2006)]] explains that modern development literature tends to view poverty as agency filled. When poverty is prescribed agency, poverty becomes something that happens to people. Poverty absorbs people into itself and the people, in turn, become a part of poverty, devoid of their human characteristics. In the same way, poverty, according to Green, is viewed as an object in which all social relations (and persons involved) are obscured. Issues such as structural failings (see earlier section), institutionalized inequalities, or corruption may lie at the heart of a region's poverty, but these are obscured by broad statements about poverty. [[Arjun Appadurai]] writes of the “terms of recognition” (drawn from Charles Taylor's ‘points of recognition), which are given the poor are what allows poverty to take on this generalized autonomous form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2006|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms are “given” to the poor because the poor lack social and economic capital, and thus have little to no influence on how they are represented and/or perceived in the larger community. Furthermore, the term “poverty”, is often used in a generalized matter. This further removes the poor from defining their situation as the broadness of the term covers differences in histories and causes of local inequalities. Solutions or plans for reduction of poverty often fail precisely because the context of a region's poverty is removed and local conditions are not considered.

The specific ways in which the poor and poverty are recognized frame them in a negative light. In development literature, poverty becomes something to be eradicated, or, attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2006|pp=&lt;!--full --&gt;1108–1129}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is always portrayed as a singular problem to be fixed. When a negative view of poverty (as an animate object) is fostered, it can often lead to an extension of negativity to those who are experiencing it. This in turn can lead to justification of inequalities through the idea of the deserving poor. Even if thought patterns do not go as far as justification, the negative light poverty is viewed in, according to Appadurai, does much to ensure little change in the policies of redistribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Appadurai|2004|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poverty as restriction of opportunities===
The environment of poverty is one marked with unstable conditions and a lack of capital (both social and economical) which together create the vulnerability characteristic of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chakravarti|2006||pp=&lt;!--full --&gt;363–376}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because a person's daily life is lived within the person's environment, a person's environment determines daily decisions and actions based on what is present and what is not. Dipkanar Chakravarti argues that the poor's daily practice of navigating the world of poverty generates a fluency in the poverty environment but a near illiteracy in the environment of the larger society. Thus, when a poor person enters into transactions and interactions with the social norm, that person's understanding of it is limited, and thus decisions revert to decisions most effective in the poverty environment. Through this a sort of cycle is born in which the “dimensions of poverty are not merely additive, but are interacting and reinforcing in nature.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chakravarti|2006|p=365}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[#CITEREFAppadurai2004|Arjun Appadurai (2004)]], the key to the environment of poverty, which causes the poor to enter into this cycle, is the poor's lack of capacities. Appardurai's idea of capacity relates to Albert Hirschman's ideas of “voice” and “exit” which are ways in which people can decline aspects of their environment; to voice displeasure and aim for change or to leave said aspect of environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Appadurai|2004|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a person in poverty lacks adequate voice and exit (capacities) with which they can change their position. Appadurai specifically deals with the capacity to aspire and its role in the continuation of poverty and its environment. Aspirations are formed through social life and its interactions. Thus, it can be said, that one's aspirations are influenced by one's environment. Appadurai claims that the better off one is, the more chances one has to not only reach aspirations but to also see the pathways which lead to the fulfillment of aspirations. By actively practicing the use of their capacity of aspiration the elite not only expand their aspiration horizon but also solidify their ability to reach aspirations by learning the easiest and most efficient paths through said practice. On the other hand, the poor's horizon of aspiration is much closer and less steady than that of the elite.

Thus, the capacity to aspire requires practice, and, as Chakravarti argues, when a capacity (or decision making process) is not refined through practice it falters and often fails. The unstable life of poverty often limits the poor's aspiration levels to those of necessity (such as having food to feed ones family) and in turn reinforces the lowered aspiration levels (someone who is busy studying, instead of looking for ways to get enough food, will not survive long in the poverty environment). Because the capacity to aspire (or lack thereof) reinforces and perpetuates the cycle of poverty, Appadurai claims that expanding the poor's aspiration horizon will help the poor to find both voice and exit. Ways of doing this include changing the terms of recognition (see previous section) and/or creating programs which provide the poor with an arena in which to practice capacities. An example of one such arena may be a housing development built for the poor, by the poor. Through this, the poor are able to not only show their abilities but to also gain practice dealing with governmental agencies and society at large. Through collaborative projects, the poor are able to expand their aspiration level above and beyond tomorrow's meal to the cultivation of skills and the entrance into the larger market.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Appadurai|2004|pp=&lt;!-- full --&gt;59–84}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis has inflamed the longstanding debate over whether viruses are living [[organisms]]. Many biologists do not consider viruses to be alive, but the hypothesis posits that viruses are the originators of the DNA genetic mechanism shared by all [[eukaryote]]s alive today (and possibly that of [[prokaryote]]s as well).&lt;ref name="jean"/&gt;

== Hypothesis ==
The viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis posits that eukaryotes are composed of three ancestral elements: a viral component that became the modern nucleus; a prokaryotic cell (an [[Archaea|archaeon]] according to [[eocyte hypothesis]]) which donated the [[cytoplasm]] and cell membrane of modern cells; and another prokaryotic (bacterial) cell that, by [[endocytosis]], became the modern [[mitochondrion]] or [[chloroplast]]. 

In 2006, researchers suggested that the transition from [[RNA]] to [[DNA]] genomes first occurred in the viral world.&lt;ref name="pnas"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0510333103 |title=Three RNA cells for ribosomal lineages and three DNA viruses to replicate their genomes: A hypothesis for the origin of cellular domain |year=2006 |last1=Forterre |first1=Patrick |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=103 |issue=10 |pmid=16505372 |jstor=30048645 |bibcode=2006PNAS..103.3669F |pages=3669–74 |pmc=1450140}}&lt;/ref&gt; A DNA-based virus may have provided storage for an ancient host that had previously used RNA to store its genetic information (such host is called ribocell or ribocyte).&lt;ref name="jean"/&gt; Viruses may initially have adopted DNA as a way to resist RNA-degrading [[enzyme]]s in the host cells. Hence, the contribution from such a new component may have been as significant as the contribution from [[chloroplast]]s or mitochondria. Following this hypothesis, archaea, [[bacteria]], and eukaryotes each obtained their DNA informational system from a different virus.&lt;ref name="pnas"/&gt; In the original paper it was also an [[RNA]] cell at the origin of eukaryotes, but eventually more complex, featuring [[Post-transcriptional modification|RNA processing]]. Although this is in contrast to nowadays more probable eocyte hypothesis, viruses seem to have contributed to the origin of all three domains of life ('out of virus hypothesis'). It has also been suggested that [[telomerase]] and [[telomeres]], key aspects of eukaryotic cell replication, have viral origins. Further, the viral origins of the modern eukaryotic nucleus may have relied on multiple [[infections]] of archaeal cells carrying bacterial mitochondrial precursors with [[Lysogenic cycle|lysogenic viruses]].&lt;ref name="witzany2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12304-008-9018-0 |title=The viral origins of telomeres and telomerases and their important role in eukaryogenesis and genome maintenance |year=2008 |last1=Witzany |first1=Guenther |journal=Biosemiotics |url=http://www.mitdenker.at/life/Telomeres.pdf |volume=1 |pages=191–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis depicts a model of eukaryotic evolution in which a virus, similar to a modern [[pox virus]], evolved into a nucleus via gene acquisition from existing bacterial and archaeal species. The lysogenic virus then became the information storage center for the cell, while the cell retained its capacities for gene translation and general function despite the viral genome's entry. Similarly, the bacterial species involved in this eukaryogenesis retained its capacity to produce energy in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] while also passing much of its genetic information into this new virus-nucleus organelle. It is hypothesized that the modern cell cycle, whereby [[mitosis]], meiosis, and sex occur in all eukaryotes, evolved because of the balances struck by viruses, which characteristically follow a pattern of tradeoff between infecting as many hosts as possible and killing an individual host through viral proliferation. Hypothetically, [[viral replication]] cycles may mirror those of [[plasmids]] and viral lysogens. However, this theory is controversial, and additional experimentation involving archaeal viruses is necessary, as they are probably the most evolutionarily similar to modern eukaryotic nuclei.&lt;ref name="bell2006"/&gt; 

The viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis points to the cell cycle of eukaryotes, particularly sex and [[meiosis]], as evidence.&lt;ref name="bell2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/jjtbi200605015 |year=2006 |author=Philip John Livingstone Bell|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=243 |issue=1 |pages=54–63 |title=Sex and the eukaryotic cell cycle is consistent with a viral ancestry for the eukaryotic nucleus |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002251930600213X#}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about the origins of DNA or reproduction in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. It is thus possible that viruses were involved in the creation of Earth's first cells.&lt;ref name="trevors2003"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1078/0944-5013-00171 |title=Genetic material in the early evolution of bacteria |year=2003 |last1=Trevors |first1=Jack Thomas |journal=Microbiological Research |volume=158 |issue=11 |pages=1–6 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944501304700968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like viruses,{{which|date=December 2017}} a eukaryotic nucleus contains linear [[chromosome]]s with specialized end sequences (in contrast to bacterial genomes, which have a circular topology); it uses [[MRNA guanylyltransferase|mRNA capping]], and separates [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] from [[Translation (biology)|translation]]. Eukaryotic nuclei are also capable of cytoplasmic replication. Some large viruses have their own DNA-directed [[RNA polymerase]].&lt;ref name="jean"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/gb-2006-7-6-110 |year=2006 |last1=Claverie |first1=Jean-Michel |journal=Genome Biology |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=110 |pmid=16787527 |title=Viruses take center stage in cellular evolution |pmc=1779534}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transfers of "infectious" nuclei have been documented in many [[Parasitism|parasitic]] [[red algae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1105/tpc.7.11.1899 |title=Fate of Parasite and Host Organelle DNA during Cellular Transformation of Red Algae by Their Parasites |year=1995 |last1=Goff |first1=Lynda J. |last2=Coleman |first2=Annette W. |author2-link = Annette W. Coleman |journal=The Plant Cell Online |volume=7 |issue=11 |pmid=12242362 |jstor=3870197 |pages=1899–1911 |pmc=161048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==
A number of precepts in the theory are possible. For instance, a helical virus with a [[Lipid bilayer|bilipid]] [[Viral envelope|envelope]] bears a distinct resemblance to a highly simplified [[Cell nucleus|cellular nucleus]] (i.e., a DNA chromosome encapsulated within a lipid membrane). In theory, a large DNA virus could take control of a [[bacteria]]l or archaeal cell. Instead of replicating and destroying the host cell, it would remain within the cell, thus overcoming the tradeoff dilemma typically faced by viruses. With the virus in control of the host cell's molecular machinery, it would effectively become a functional nucleus. Through the processes of mitosis and [[cytokinesis]], the virus would thus recruit the entire cell as a symbiont—a new way to survive and proliferate.

The similarities between DNA viruses and nuclei can be taken as evidence either of viral eukaryogensis or of its converse, nuclear viriogenesis: that complex eukaryotic DNA viruses could have originated from infectious nuclei.&lt;ref name="jean"/&gt;

'''Xenointoxication''' is a form of [[pest control]] in which an [[ectoparasite]]'s [[host animal]] is dosed with a substance that is poisonous to the parasite. When the parasite feeds on its host, it is poisoned, and eventually dies.

An example of this strategy is the experimental use of oral [[ivermectin]] in humans to kill [[Bed bug (insect)|bed bug]]s and [[parasitic worm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pill Could Join Arsenal Against Bedbugs |url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/31/pill-could-join-arsenal-against-bedbugs/ |work=The New York Times |accessdate=1 January 2013 |author=Donald G.

This method was unsuccessful in a 1969 study attempting to control ''[[Triatoma infestans]]'' in chicken houses because even though some bugs that fed on the treated birds did die, so did the birds, and the birds that survived produced fewer eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marsden |first1=P.
