==Plot==
Set in 1963, the film revolves around Melody Ellison, an African-American girl living in Detroit, Michigan with her mother Frances and her grandfather Frank. Early on she and her family faced racial inequality in their hometown, whether being bullied at school with a white student named Donald along with his friends for her ethnicity, or be wrongfully accused of [[shoplifting]] at a clothing store where Melody's mother works.

A turning point for Melody was when a fellow student expressed her intention of moving to another school out of fear for being discriminated, and when news about the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] was aired on television, making her question the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] and consider moving to a school at her neighborhood.&lt;ref name="Petski"/&gt; Fearing that a similar bombing would happen at the chapel where Melody's family attend mass in, Melody tries to convince her mother not to perform at a fundraising concert for the Birmingham victims; Frances reassures her, and sees hope in her daughter. Melody puts her creative skill at clothing design to good use, upcycling an old garment into a shawl for her mother to wear at her piano performance.

At church she meets her teacher Miss Abbot, who brought the other students along as part of a field trip. Donald walks out as he refuses to take Melody along; Melody's best friend Tricia volunteers to accompany her instead. The concert takes place as planned, and Melody and the rest of the churchgoers then perform ''[[Lift Every Voice and Sing]]''. The film ends with Melody and her mother being given an applause for their performance. A short tribute to the four young victims of the Birmingham bombing appears in a post-credits sequence.

'''''Angel of the Resurrection''''' is a massive [[stained glass]] window by the American [[Art Nouveau]] glass manufacturer [[Tiffany Studios]], now in the collection of the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]. It was commissioned by former-[[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] Mary Lord Harrison as a memorial to her husband, President [[Benjamin Harrison]]. Completed in 1904, the window depicts the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] calling for the dead to rise at the [[Second Coming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Solga |first=Kim |title=Louis Tiffany Angel of the Resurrection - 1904 |url=http://www.kidsart.com/IS/429.html |publisher=KidsArt |accessdate=27 November 2012 |year=1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312103956/http://www.kidsart.com/IS/429.html |archivedate=12 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Although his trumpet often leads to the assumption that the angel here is [[Gabriel]], he is in fact Michael, using the trumpet to signal the dead to rise again.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dressed in [[chainmail]] like a crusading knight from the books of [[Sir Walter Scott]], Michael cuts a dashing figure in keeping with the era's romanticism. Although [[Louis Comfort Tiffany|Tiffany]] was absorbed in numerous other projects at the time, he gave his team of gifted designers input before bestowing his approval upon the final composition. Several of his brilliant innovations in glass manufacturing are visible in this piece, including the swirling opalescence of his trademark mottled glass, drapery glass in Michael's robes, and the ruffling on the wings to resemble feathers. The assembly was equally innovative, with lead not merely holding the glass in place but defining the image and creating linear effects. Furthermore, his layering of glass creates dazzling depths and color effects. "Awake Thou That Sleepest. Arise from the Dead and Christ Shall Give Thee Light" from Ephesians 5:14 is inscribed on the window.&lt;ref name=ima/&gt;

==Historical information==
''Angel of the Resurrection'' was commissioned in 1901 for the First Meridian Heights Presbyterian Church in Indianapolis, by Mary Lord Harrison in memory of her husband, President [[Benjamin Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glorious Color|url=http://speedwaydailyphoto.blogspot.com/2012/04/glorious-color.html|publisher=Speedway Daily Photo|accessdate=27 November 2012|date=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church had particular importance for Harrison, who had been a church [[Presbyterian polity#Elder|elder]] for over forty years.&lt;ref name=day&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Holliday T.|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art Collections Handbook|year=1988|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|isbn=0936260203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total cost, including installation and external glass protection, was $1500.&lt;ref name=harrison/&gt;

===Location history===
The new [[Presbyterian]] church being constructed at the time of Harrison's death housed the window from its dedication in 1905 until it was donated to the IMA in 1972. The original watercolor sketch by Frederick Wilson, a Tiffany designer, resides at the [[Benjamin Harrison Home]].&lt;ref name=harrison&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tiffany Touch|url=http://www.presidentbenjaminharrison.org/learn/exhibits/past-exhibits/19-learn/exhibits/past-exhibits/59-the-tiffany-touch|publisher=[[Benjamin Harrison Home|Benjamin Harrison Presidential Site]]|accessdate=27 November 2012|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Angel of the Resurrection'' has the acquisition number 72.75.

'''Arts Educational Schools, London''', commonly known as '''ArtsEd''' is an independent [[performing arts]] school based in [[Chiswick]] in the [[London Borough of Hounslow]].

==Overview==
ArtsEd provides specialist vocational training at secondary, further and higher education level in [[musical theatre]] and [[acting]] for [[film]] and [[television]]. The school also offers part-time and holiday courses in the performing arts. The school is accredited by [[Drama UK]] and it offers Qualifications and Curriculum Authority recognised qualifications validated by the [[City University London]] or [[Trinity College, London]].

In 2013 ArtsEd was awarded a grant by the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation]] to fund a refurbishment project. The money was spent on the main theatre, costume storage, the School of Film and Television and the school's access facilities.

Arts Educational Schools London is accredited by Drama UK and is one of twenty-one specialist performing arts schools approved to offer government-funded [[Dance and Drama Awards]], a scheme established to subsidise the cost of professional dance and drama training for the most talented students at leading institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/14To19/MoneyToLearn/DanceandDrama/DG_066987|title=Grants and bursaries for adult learners|publisher=|access-date=6 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204003441/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/14To19/MoneyToLearn/DanceandDrama/DG_066987|archive-date=4 February 2009|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/14To19/MoneyToLearn/DanceandDrama/DG_10023485 Gov.uk: Dance and Drama 10023485] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716054443/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/14To19/MoneyToLearn/DanceandDrama/DG_10023485 |date=16 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the School was rated "Outstanding" by Ofsted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/50527|title=Find an inspection report and registered childcare|first=Ofsted Communications Team.|last=enquiries@ofsted.gov.uk|date=14 December 2017|website=reports.ofsted.gov.uk|access-date=14 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625145130/http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/50527|archive-date=25 June 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

ArtsEd originated from two schools: one founded in 1919 by Grace Cone, the other in 1922 by Olive Ripman. Both offered curriculae combining a general academic education with training in dance, drama, music and art, in preparation for professional careers in or connected with the theatre. In 1939 the two schools amalgamated to form the Cone Ripman School, later named the Arts Educational Schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://artsed.co.uk/site/information/About-Us |title=About Us |accessdate=24 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813054003/https://artsed.co.uk/site/information/About-Us |archive-date=13 August 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was first based at Stratford Place in London, but following the outbreak of [[World War II]], relocated to [[Tring]], [[Hertfordshire]], sharing premises with [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons|Rothschild Bank]] at [[Tring Park]].

In 1941, the school reopened at Stratford Place, while the second school continued to operate in Tring. In 1947, both schools were renamed the Arts Educational Schools. The London school was later based at Golden Lane House in the Barbican until 1986 when the school purchased the former buildings of Acton and Chiswick Polytechnic. This building is now known as Cone Ripman House.

In the 2000s the two schools became independent of each other, and the Tring school has been renamed [[Tring Park School for the Performing Arts]]. Today, Arts Educational Schools London is a co–educational Independent Day School and Sixth Form for pupils aged 11–18, and a professional [[conservatoire]] specialising in acting and musical theatre, as well as a range of part-time courses.

For many years, the president of the school was [[prima ballerina assoluta]] [[Dame Alicia Markova]] and [[Dame Beryl Grey]] became Director in the 1960s. Dame Alicia was succeeded in 2007 by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]. Iain Reid was dean of the schools from 1999 until his retirement in December 2006. He was succeeded by John Baraldi, former chief executive of Riverside Studios,and former director of the East 15 Acting School; Baraldi left the school in early 2009, and was succeeded by Jane Harrison. The current dean is Chris Hocking.

'''''Bailed Up''''' is a [[1895 in art|1895]] painting by Australian artist [[Tom Roberts]]. The painting depicts a [[stage coach]] being held up by [[bushranger]]s in an isolated, forested section of a back road. The painting is part of the collection of the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]].&lt;ref name="AGNSW"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bailed up |url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/833 |work=Collection |publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales |accessdate=22 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029011447/http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/work/833%2Bbailed-up |archivedate=29 October 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described by the former Senior Curator as "the greatest Australian landscape ever painted".&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hawley |first=Janet |title=Tom Roberts Bailed Up |url=http://www.commercialpainter.com.au/commercial-painter-articles/1996/2/24/tom-roberts-bailed-up/ |accessdate=22 October 2010 |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=24 February 1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706102913/http://www.commercialpainter.com.au/commercial-painter-articles/1996/2/24/tom-roberts-bailed-up/ |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Roberts painted the work while staying at ''Newstead'' [[sheep station]]&amp;mdash;near [[Inverell, New South Wales]]&amp;mdash;owned by his friend Duncan Anderson. He had earlier painted ''[[The Golden Fleece (painting)|The Golden Fleece]]'', his second painting depicting [[sheep shearing]], while at ''Newstead''.&lt;ref name=AGNSW /&gt; The notorious bushranger [[Captain Thunderbolt]] had been active in the Inverell area more than twenty five years earlier and Roberts conceived an idea of painting a bushranging scene.&lt;ref name=AGNSW /&gt;

Roberts found his location for the painting along the road between ''Newstead'' and ''Paradise'', a neighbouring station. The location was remote, on a flat bend on an uphill stretch of the road, surrounded by "grass trees and a forest of tall gums."&lt;ref name=AGNSW /&gt; At this spot Roberts, with assistance from the Anderson family, constructed a viewing platform in a tree growing on the slope below the road, thus setting himself up at road level. Roberts painted the [[Cobb and Co]] coach in Inverell and modelled the characters in the painting on people in Inverell and station hands at ''Newstead''. Before starting on the main canvas Roberts "made tiny drawings and an oil sketch of how he wanted the scene to look."&lt;ref name=AGNSW /&gt;

==Reception==
Once complete, Roberts exhibited ''Bailed Up'' in Sydney and Melbourne. Critical reception to the work was mixed; with comment in the press about "the way the legs of the men, or the skin of the horses had been depicted" among other things. Pearce considered that "[p]erhaps unsatisfactory pictorial resolution was sensed" by collectors. Regardless, for a thirty-year period the painting failed to find a buyer.&lt;ref name=AGNSW /&gt; Roberts reduced his asking price from £275 to 75 [[guinea (British coin)|guineas]] in 1900 but still no buyer could be found.&lt;ref name=AGNSW /&gt;

In 1927, Roberts reworked the painting and the extent of this rework has been difficult to ascertain.&lt;ref name=AGNSW /&gt; Using X-ray photography, art historians now think that Roberts simplified the work considerably, making it flatter and more abstract, in the [[modernist]] style that had come into vogue at that time.&lt;ref name="Rewind"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Warren|title=Bailed Up|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/rewind/txt/s1244508.htm|work=Rewind|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was finally sold for 500 guineas in 1928, purchased by a Sydney solicitor, J. W. Maund. Maund was also a trustee of the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] and he immediately lent the painting to the gallery&amp;mdash;selling it to them five years later.&lt;ref name=AGNSW /&gt;

En route to an exhibition in Melbourne in 1956&amp;mdash;part of the cultural program of the [[1956 Summer Olympics]]&amp;mdash; the painting fell off the back of a truck. The painting was damaged but successfully restored.&lt;ref name=Rewind /&gt;

'''William Ronald "Bill" Reid Jr.''', [[Order of British Columbia|OBC]] ({{date|12 January 1920|dmy}} – {{date|13 March 1998|dmy}}) ([[Haida people|Haida]]) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] artist whose works include [[jewelry]], [[sculpture]], [[screen-printing]], and [[paintings]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/william-ronald-reid/ "Bill Reid"], ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his major works were featured on the [[Canadian twenty-dollar bill#Canadian Journey Series|Canadian $20 banknote]] of the [[Canadian Journey Series (banknotes)|Canadian Journey series]] (2004–2012).

==Biography==

===Early years===    
William Ronald Reid Jr., called Bill, was born in [[Victoria, British Columbia]]; his father was American William Ronald Reid Sr., of Scottish-German descent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/aborig/reid/reid02e.shtml Bill Reid], Can. Museum of Civilization&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother, Sophie Gladstone Reid, was from the Kaadaas gaah Kiiguwaay, Raven/Wolf [[Clan]] of T'anuu, more commonly known as the [[Haida people|Haida]], one of the [[First Nations]] of the Pacific coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theravenscall.ca/en/who/life_story |title=Who was Bill Reid? |author=Bill Reid Foundation |year=2010 |work=The Raven's Call |publisher=virtualmuseum.ca |accessdate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reid developed a keen interest in Haida art while working as a radio announcer in [[Toronto]] for [[CBC Radio]], where he also studied jewelry making at the [[Ryerson Institute of Technology]]. His maternal grandfather first taught Reid about Haida art, and through him, Bill inherited his tools from his great-great-uncle [[Charles Edenshaw]], a renowned artist who died the year Reid was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Christie|title=Raven's Cry|date=1966|publisher=McClelland and Stewart|location=Toronto|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Robin K.|last2=Ginson|first2=Mandy|editor1-last=Wright|editor1-first=Robin K.|editor2-last=Augaitis|editor2-first=Daina|title=Charles Edenshaw|date=2013|publisher=Black Dog Publishing|location=London|isbn=9781908966209|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Reid returned to [[Vancouver]], where he eventually established a studio on [[Granville Island]]. He became greatly interested in the works of Edenshaw, working to understand the [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] of his work, much of which had been lost along with many Haida traditions. During this time Reid also worked on salvaging artifacts, including many intricately carved [[totem pole]]s, which were then moldering in abandoned village sites. He assisted in the partial reconstruction of a Haida village in the [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC|University of British Columbia Museum of Anthropology]].

At the age of 29, Reid married a woman named Mabel. They had one child together and later adopted a second.

Working in the traditional forms and modern media (usually [[gold]], [[silver]] and [[Haida argillite carvings|argillite]]), Reid began by making jewelry. He gradually explored larger sculptures in [[bronze]], [[Western red cedar|red cedar]] and [[Callitropsis nootkatensis|Nootka Cypress]] (yellow cedar), usually portraying figures, animals, and scenes from [[folklore]]. He intended to express his ancestors' visual traditions into a contemporary form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moa.ubc.ca/exhibits/online_sourcebooks.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127134833/http://moa.ubc.ca/exhibits/online_sourcebooks.php |archivedate=2012-01-27 |df= }}, Museum of Anthropology&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major works and awards===
Reid's most popular works are three large bronze sculptures. Two depict a [[canoe]] filled with human and animal figures: one black, ''The [[Spirit of Haida Gwaii]]'', is at the [[Canadian Embassy, Washington, D.C.]], in the United States; and one green, ''The Jade Canoe'', is at [[Vancouver International Airport]], in [[British Columbia]]. The third sculpture, ''Chief of the Undersea World'', depicts a breaching [[orca]] and is installed at the [[Vancouver Aquarium]]. [[Plaster cast]]s of these sculptures are held by the [[Canadian Museum of History]] in [[Gatineau]], Canada.

==Legacy and honours==
Reid received many honours in his life, including honorary degrees from the [[University of British Columbia]], the [[University of Toronto]], the [[University of Victoria]], the [[University of Western Ontario]], [[York University]], and [[Trent University]]. He received the [[Indspire Awards|National Aboriginal Achievement Award]], the Indspire Awards, for Lifetime Achievement in 1994, and was made a member of the [[Order of British Columbia]] and an Officer of [[France]]'s [[Order of Arts and Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/1998/1998-06-27/pdf/g1-13226.pdf ''Canada Gazette'' Part I, Vol. 132, No. 26] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522232342/http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/1998/1998-06-27/pdf/g1-13226.pdf |date=2013-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was made a member of the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]].&lt;ref name=RCA1880&gt;{{cite web|title=Members since 1880 |url=http://www.rca-arc.ca/en/about_members/since1880.asp |publisher=Royal Canadian Academy of Arts |accessdate=11 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526215339/http://www.rca-arc.ca/en/about_members/since1880.asp |archivedate=26 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April 1996 Canada Post issued 'The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, 1986-1991, Bill Reid' in the Masterpieces of Canadian art series. The stamp was designed by [[Pierre-Yves Pelletier]] based on the sculpture ''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii'' (1991) by William Ronald Reid in the Canadian Embassy, Washington, United States. The 90¢ stamps are perforated 12.5 x 13 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca/netacgi/nph-brs?s1=%28art.TITP.%29+Or+%28art.TITI.+And+null.B742.%29&amp;l=20&amp;d=STMP&amp;p=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2Farchivianet%2F02011702_e.html&amp;r=12&amp;f=G&amp;Sect1=STMP |title=Canada Post stamp |access-date=2018-11-07 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130101051500/http://data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca/netacgi/nph-brs?s1=(art.TITP.)+Or+(art.TITI.+And+null.B742.)&amp;l=20&amp;d=STMP&amp;p=1&amp;u=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/archivianet/02011702_e.html&amp;r=12&amp;f=G&amp;Sect1=STMP |archive-date=2013-01-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of his sculptures, ''Raven and the First Men'' and ''[[Spirit of Haida Gwaii]]'', are prominently featured on the [[Canadian twenty-dollar bill|$20 note]] in the [[Bank of Canada]]'s new ''Canadian Journey'' (2004) issue, paired with a quotation from author [[Gabrielle Roy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bank-banque-canada.ca/en/banknotes/general/character/2001-04_20.html $20- 2001-2004 Series, ''Canadian Journey''- Bank note series, 1935 to present- Bank Notes- Bank of Canada&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
Reid participated in the blockades of logging roads which helped save the rain forests of [[Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site|Gwaii Haanas (South Moresby)]]. He stopped work on the sculpture in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] during this period to protest the destruction of the forests of [[Haida Gwaii]], by the time Bill Reid was alive the archipelago was called the Queen Charlotte Islands. In 1981, he married Martine de Widerspach-Thor (Mormanne), a French anthropologist.

Having dedicated the later part of his life to the creation of new works and these tasks of [[curator|curation]], Reid died on 13 March 1998, of [[Parkinson's disease]], in Vancouver. In July 1998 friends and relatives paddled Lootaas, a large cedar canoe carved by Reid for [[Expo 86]], on a two-day journey along the Pacific coast to bring his ashes to Tanu Island in [[Haida Gwaii]], the site of his [[New Clew, British Columbia|mother's village]] of New Clew.

==History==

[[File:Figure of a Luohan from the Chenghua period..JPG|thumb|left|Figure of a Luohan from the Chenghua period]]
The eclectic collection was acquired over many years by [[William Burrell|Sir William Burrell]], a wealthy Glaswegian shipping magnate and art collector, who then gave it to the city of [[Glasgow Corporation]] in 1944.&lt;ref name=arch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glasgowarchitecture.co.uk/burrell_museum.htm |title=The Burrell Museum, Burrell Collection, Glasgow Museum |accessdate=17 February 2008 |date= |work= |publisher=Glasgowarchitecture.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gift was made on the condition that the collection was to be housed in a building 16&amp;nbsp;miles (26&amp;nbsp;km) from the centre of Glasgow, to show the works to their greatest advantage, and to avoid the damaging effects of air pollution at the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culture24.org.uk/sc000074&lt;/ref&gt; The trustees spent over 20 years trying to find a suitable 'home' for the collection, one which met all the criteria set out in the Trust Deed, without success. Eventually, when the [[Pollok Country Park|Pollok Estate]] was given to the city in 1967, the Trustees had certain terms of the deed waived, which allowed the current site, 3&amp;nbsp;miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) from the city centre and within the city boundaries, to be chosen for the collection.&lt;ref name=museums&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glasgowmuseums.com/venue/index.cfm?venueid=1 |title=The Burrell Collection |accessdate=17 February 2008 |author=  |date= |work= |publisher=[[Glasgow Museums]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==
A design competition for the museum building in 1971 was delayed by a postal strike, allowing time for the eventual winning architect [[Barry Gasson]] to complete his entry, designed in collaboration with John Meunier and [[Brit Andresen]].

The building is L-shaped in plan and is specifically tailored to house and display the diverse collection, with larger pieces such as Romanesque doorways built into the structure, at the same time giving views out into the park over formal grassed areas to the south, and into adjacent woodland to the north.

The entrance, through a 16th-century stone archway built into a modern red sandstone gable, leads to a shop and other facilities, then on to a central courtyard under a glazed roof, adjacent to the reconstructions of three rooms from the Burrell's home, [[Hutton Castle]] near [[Berwick-on-Tweed]]: the wood panelled drawing room, hall, and dining room complete with their furnishings. Galleries on two levels house various smaller artefacts, over a basement storage level, and at the lower level a restaurant gives views over the lawn to the south.&lt;ref name=arch/&gt;

The museum was opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1983, and was named as [[Prospect 100 best modern Scottish buildings|Scotland's second greatest post-war building]] (after [[Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia]]'s [[St Peter's Seminary, Cardross|St Peter's Seminary]]) in a poll of architects by [[Prospect (architecture magazine)|Prospect]] magazine in 2005.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The building was awarded A-listed status by Historic Scotland in February 2013 in recognition of its position as one of the country’s finest examples of 1970s architectural design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgowarchitecture.co.uk/burrell_collection.htm |title=Burrell Collection - Glasgow Museum Building |publisher=Glasgowarchitecture.co.uk |date=1 February 2013 |accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stained glass===
The museum is home to one of the greatest assemblies of medieval stained glass in the world. There are more than 700 stained glass panels from across Europe in the collection, including many examples of Gothic, Renaissance and Romanesque styles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cannon-macinnes.co.uk/linda-cannon/&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the glass has [[heraldry|heraldic]] motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first= Stephen|editor-last= Friar|title= A New Dictionary of Heraldry|location= London|year= 1987|publisher= [[A &amp; C Black|Alphabooks/A&amp;C Black]]|isbn= 0 906670 44 6|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 a project was commenced to conserve and research the museum's collection of stained glass from the [[Carmelite]] church at Boppard-am-Rhein, Germany. The 34 panels that make up the Burrell collection of Boppard windows have a combined surface area of 14 square metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Conservation Project Under Way at The Burrell Collection|url=http://vidimus.org/blogs/news/new-conservation-project-underway-at-the-burrell-collection/|date=17 Apr 2013|journal=Vidimus|issue=68|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Codman''' (1800 – September 11, 1842) was a noted American painter. Codman, who lived his entire life in Portland, Maine, was known for his [[Landscape art|landscape]] and [[Marine art|marine]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://whitemountainart.com/Biographies/bio_cc.htm | title=Charles Codman (1800–1842) | work=White Mountain Art &amp; Artists | accessdate=22 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Codman was apprenticed to the [[wikt:ornamental|ornamental]] painter, [[John Ritto Penniman]], where he began as a decorative painter with no formal training.  He is classified as a [[limner]].  He eventually produced more mature works of romanticized landscape views. One of his more important commissions was to paint five [[fireboards]] (decorative panels placed over hearths during the summertime) in the landscape style for the Portland mansion of shipbuilder [[James Deering]]. He also filled commissions for both portraiture and decorative arts.

His work was "discovered" in 1828 by the contemporary art critic, [[John Neal (writer)|John Neal]] (1793–1876).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Codman died on September 11, 1842 in Portland, Maine.  He is buried in [[Eastern Cemetery]].

Today, Codman's work can be found in various museums and institutions such as the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], the [[Brooklyn Museum]], the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]].

The '''Niño Dios''' (literally Child God) '''of Mexico''' is a tradition of venerating the [[Child Jesus]] in Mexico which has taken root from the time it was introduced in the 16th century and then syncretized with pre-Hispanic elements to form some unique traditions.&lt;ref name="pastorelas"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/1885-Las-pastorelas-en-M%E9xico |title= Las pastorelas en México |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Pastorelas of Mexico |accessdate=January 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="secuestrados"&gt;{{cite news |title= Santo Niño Cautivo, patrono de los secuestrados |author= El Sol de México |url= http://www.oem.com.mx/oem/notas/n924646.htm |newspaper= El Sol de México |location=Mexico City |date=9 November 2008 |accessdate=January 20, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Holy Niño Cautivo, patron of the kidnapped }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman Catholicism in Mexico|Mexican Catholics]] have their own images of the Child Jesus, which is honored and celebrated during the Christmas season, especially on Christmas Eve and on [[Candlemas]] (2 February). One tradition unique to Mexico is to dress the image in new clothing each year for presentation at Mass on Candlemas. This dress can vary from representations of the saints, [[Aztec]] dress, football/soccer players and more. Also, there are Niño Dios images which are locally famous and honored year-round.&lt;ref name="dhiga"&gt;{{cite news |title= A vestir de gala al Niño Dios  |first= Daniel  |last= Higa Alquicira  |url= http://www.terra.com.mx/articulo.aspx?articuloid=181363 |newspaper=Terra |location=Mexico City |accessdate=January 20, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Dressing up the Niño Dios }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Veneration of the Child Jesus is a European tradition with the best-known examples being the [[Infant Jesus of Prague]] and the [[Santo Niño de Atocha]]. This
tradition was brought by the Spanish to Mexico after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]];  In Mexico this veneration has taken on indigenous elements,&lt;ref name="dhiga"/&gt; and is considered to be one of the most deeply rooted Catholic traditions in Mexico.&lt;ref name="arraigo"&gt;{{cite news |title= Tiene arraigo en México la veneración al Niño Dios |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/404275.html |agency= Notimex  |newspaper= El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=2 February 2007 |accessdate=January 20, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Veneration of the Niño Dios has deep roots in Mexico }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of the reason for this was that native Mexicans already had traditions of representing deities in painting or sculpture with rites dedicated to that incarnation, including dramatizations.&lt;ref name="pastorelas"/&gt; One of the oldest traditions related to the Child Jesus in Mexico is the “pastorela,” a dramatization based on the birth of Jesus. The “Adoración de los Reyes Magos” (The [[Biblical Magi|Adoration of the Magi]]) was probably the first “pastorela” in Mexico which was organized by Friar Andrés de Olmos. It was written in [[Nahuatl]] and there were adaptations to indigenous culture in the script as well. The tradition of reenacting scenes from the birth of Christ was recognized by [[Juan de Zumárraga]], the first bishop of [[New Spain]] who ordered that this practice be widespread for evangelization. Very early on, these reenactments began to vary by local custom and region and were most frequently done by the lower classes. The main theme of these works is the journey of the [[Biblical magi|Three Wise Men]] to [[Bethlehem]], but demons try to get in their way. In most versions, the demons are vanquished by the [[Archangel Michael]] or another angel and the Wise Men arrive to their destination. Characters most often include shepherds, demons, angels and the Wise Men. Other characters sometimes appear such as Mary and Joseph, Indians, ranchers and monks. At the end of the play, all kiss the image of the infant Jesus.&lt;ref name="pastorelas"/&gt;

==Christmas Eve==
Veneration of the Christ child is strongest during the Christmas season, which officially begins a week or so before Christmas Eve (with [[Las Posadas|posadas]]) and ends on Candlemas, 2 February.  On Christmas Eve, the figure of the Christ child is laid into the Nativity scene in a celebration which is done in the home. This event is called “put the child to bed.” The figure is carried by one or more of the young women while the rest of the family sings lullabies or other children’s and/or Christmas songs.  Each member of the family kisses the image as they sing. The figure is laid in the manger, where it stays until the second of February.&lt;ref name="diosdes"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/1879-La-Nochebuena:-la-%FAltima-posada-y-el-Ni%F1o-Dios |title= La Nochebuena: la última posada y el Niño Dios |publisher=Mexico Desconocido Magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Christmas Ever: the last posada and the Niño Dios |accessdate=January 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ceremony varies by family and by community. For example, in the community of Dzitnup, in the [[Valladolid, Yucatán|municipality of Valladolid]], the Maya people here have their own variation. In addition to the laying the child in the manger, there is a dance called “Abraham and Isaac.” This dance includes people who play the two main characters as well as devils.  The dance is accompanies by a pre-Hispanic wind instrument called a “tunkul,” which is similar to the “teponatli” used in other states such as [[Guerrero]] and [[Puebla]].&lt;ref name="sicconaculta"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sic.gob.mx/ficha.php?table=festividad&amp;table_id=640|title= Fiesta del Niño Dios |publisher=CONACULTA |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Feast of the Niño Dios |accessdate=January 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Christmas Eve tradition is for children to write letters to the Christ child, typically to ask for things like toys and clothes.

==Candelaria==

Candlemas (in Spanish, Candelaria), 2 February, marks the end of the Christmas season and nativity scenes generally remain intact in the home until this date. Preparation for Candelaria can begin on 6 January, known as "[[Epiphany (holiday)|Three Kings Day]]". On this day, a ring-shaped sweet bread called a Rosca de Reyes is shared. Inside the Rosca, is one or more miniature figures of an infant are hidden. Those who find these figures have obligations to meet on Candelaria. These obligations always include being responsible for buying tamales and drinks for this day, but it can also signal a more serious commitment. It can mean that the person selected must purchase an outfit for the family’s Niño Dios for one, two or three years. The person may also need to buy an outfit for the found miniature infant.&lt;ref name="dhiga"/&gt;

Each year, the Niño Dios of the household is brought to Mass on 2 February to be blessed. After the mass, the family returns home to celebrate, typically with [[tamales]], [[buñuelos]], [[atole]] and [[hot chocolate]].&lt;ref name="dhiga"/&gt;&lt;ref name="redescolar"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://redescolar.ilce.edu.mx/redescolar/efemerides/febrero/trad-2.htm |title= 02 de febrero.- Día de la Candelaria.  |publisher=Insituto Latinoamericano de la Comunicación Educativa |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=February – Day of Candelaria |accessdate=January 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition recalls that forty days after Jesus’s birth, Mary and Joseph took the child to the Temple to present to the priests.&lt;ref name="dhiga"/&gt;

To present the Niño Dios at Mass, tradition states that the image must be dressed in a new outfit. These outfits can vary widely but a number are most popular. For those who observe the three year commitment, the image is dressed in white for the first year, symbolizing purity. This is also the case if the image being presented is new.&lt;ref name="dhiga"/&gt;&lt;ref name="derrochan"&gt;{{cite news |title= Mexicanos derrochan originalidad con vestidos del Niño Dios en la Candelaria |url= http://www.soitu.es/soitu/2008/02/02/info/1201973455_323283.html |newspaper=Soitu Noticias |location=Madrid, Spain |date=2 February 2008 |accessdate=January 20, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexicans show originality with outfits for Niño Dios on Candelaria }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common  and traditional outfits include [[Santo Niño de Atocha]] with [[crosier]] and seated on a chair, “Niño de las palomas” (Child of the doves) in a white robe with a dove between the hands, as San Francisco with sandals and brown robe, holding an animal, or “Niño de las azucenas” (Child of the lilies) with a white tunic and holding a bunch of lilies.&lt;ref name="redescolar"/&gt;

The need to buy a new outfit each year has given rise to a market in outfits for the images. Purchase of the outfits generally begins as early as December and continues until 2 February. Outfits range from the very simple made with inexpensive fabrics to elaborate creations in silk. The most common outfits are made with silk, satin, cotton and brocades decorated with silver or gold. Stationery stores generally sell the most traditional of outfits and the more expensive ones.&lt;ref name="derrochan"/&gt; However, these outfits are most commonly bought in traditional open markets called “[[tianguis]].”&lt;ref name="redescolar"/&gt;  Here, more original ones can be found and can include various saints, pre-Hispanic dress, [[mariachi]]s, soccer players and ethnic dress of various nationalities. Custom orders are also taken.&lt;ref name="derrochan"/&gt; Some priests frown upon the non-traditional outfits and only want white. Many of the outfits are original and some cause scandal, such as the Niño Dios dressed as a drug trafficker.&lt;ref name="derrochan"/&gt;

At the Casa de Cultura Griselda Alvarez in Mexico City, there was an exhibit of twenty four Niños Dios dressed in various ways: as a fisherman, as the Pope, as the [[Archangel Gabriel]], as the Sacred Heart and as the Atocha. The collection is from the La Casa de los Niños Dios Uribe. The images vary and size from very small to very large and in material, mostly being of ceramic or wood.&lt;ref name="visten"&gt;{{cite news |title="Visten" al Niño Dios |url= http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/131913.visten-al-nino-dios.html |agency= Notimex |newspaper=El Siglo de Torreon |location=Torreon, Mexico |date=2 February 2005 |accessdate=January 20, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Dressing the Niño Dios }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Particular Niño Dios images==
[[File:ProcessionNiñopa16.JPG|thumb|The [[Niñopa]] held by a girl during a procession in Xochimilco]]
In addition to the veneration of household Niños Dios during the Christmas season, there are a number of Child Jesus images that have year-round devotion. These Niños Dios often have a special place in the worship by Mexican Catholics, but sometimes they have been the objects of “kidnapping” and disputes. Most of the best-known images are in Mexico City and central Mexico.&lt;ref name="cjaramillo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dti.inah.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4072&amp;Itemid=441 |title=Niños Jesus que obran milagros |first=Carmen |last=Mondragón Jaramillo |date=7 January 2010 |publisher=[[INAH]] |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Nino Jesus that performs miracles |accessdate=January 20, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Offerings to these images are usually toys or candy, a tradition related to offerings made to the dead for the afterlife in pre-Hispanic times.&lt;ref name="secuestrados"/&gt;

One of the earliest of the Niño Dios images in Mexico is the '''Niño Cautivo''' which is in the [[Mexico City Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]]. It was sculpted in the 16th century by Juan Martinez Montañez in Spain and purchased by the cathedral. However, on its way to [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], pirates attacked the ship it was on and sacked it. To get the image back, a large ransom was paid. Today, the image is in the Chapel of San Pedro or De las Reliquias.&lt;ref name="cjaramillo"/&gt;
Traditionally, the image has been petitioned by those seeking release from restrictions or traps, especially financial problems or drug addiction or alcoholism.&lt;ref name="secuestrados"/&gt; The cult to the Niño Cautivo is considered to be “inactive” by INAH.&lt;ref name="arraigo"/&gt; However, this particular image has made a comeback since 2000 as one to petition when a family member is abducted and held for ransom.&lt;ref name="secuestrados"/&gt;

Another famous Niño Dios is the [[Niñopa]] (also written Niño-Paor Niñopan) of [[Xochimilco]], which is also from the 16th century. This image originally belonged to an indigenous chief called El Viejo.&lt;ref name="cjaramillo"/&gt;  The name “Niño Pa” is a hybrid of the Spanish word for “child” (niño) and the Nahuatl word for “place” (pan) meaning “child of the place.” It is said that this image goes about at night to visit people in their dreams and to check the crops of the community. Some claim to have found mud on the image’s shoes in the morning.&lt;ref name="arraigo"/&gt;

This image has been housed in one family’s home or another for over 430 years.  The host family who become its “godparents” or mayodomos for the year. To be a “godparent” for this image is a great honor in Xochimilco, with the list extending until 2035 with families waiting fifty years. The family prepares a special bedroom in their home to house the child for the year. Those families who have housed the image in past years have replicas of the Niño Pa.&lt;ref name="xochgob"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xochimilco.df.gob.mx/tradiciones/ninopa.html |title=Niñopa  Representación de amor y fe |publisher=Borough of Xochimilco, Mexico City |location=Xochimilco, Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Niñopa, representation of love and faith |accessdate=January 20, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908034907/http://www.xochimilco.df.gob.mx/tradiciones/ninopa.html# |archive-date=2009-09-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is claimed that this image made itself invisible when government soldiers came to claim it during the [[Cristero War]].&lt;ref name="cjaramillo"/&gt; It was presumed that the image was made of orange tree wood because of the writings about it by Martín Serón y Alvarado. However, this was proven false in the 1970s, when the image was dropped and a finger broke off. It is made the wood from a tree called “chocolín” in the workshops of [[San Bernardino de Siena Church, Xochimilco|Bernardino of Siena]] in the 16th or 17th century.&lt;ref name="xochgob"/&gt;
[[File:NiñoSuertes3.JPG|thumb|Niño de las Suertes]]
The '''Niño de las Suertes''' has a strong following due to its association with [[Santa Muerte]]. While the image was created in the 19th century, its popular veneration is a recent phenomenon. The image was found by two evangelists in the rubble of the Hacienda of San Juan de Dios in [[Tlalpan]]. It was handed over to Archbishop Francisco Lizana y Beaumont. As a number of monasteries wanted to claim it, the archbishop decided to make the decision by lottery. It is said that this image favored the [[Church of San Bernardo, Mexico City|Convent of San Bernardo]] due to the vow of poverty by its nuns. This was confirmed by doing the drawing three times. In the 19th century, due to tensions between the Mexican government and the Church, the image was moved to [[Tacubaya]] when the convent was secularized. This image has a skull by the infant's head. This originally symbolized the future [[Passion (Christiantity)|Passion]], but recently it has made this image associated with Santa Muerte, whose devotees visit.&lt;ref name="cjaramillo"/&gt;
[[File:NiñoFutbolista1.JPG|thumb|left|Niño de los Milagros or Niño Futbolista in the uniform of the Mexico national team for World Cup 2010]]
In [[Tacuba (Mexico City)|Tacuba]], there is on image called the '''Niño Futbolista''' (Child Football/Soccer player) although its real name is "Santo Niño de los Milagros." It is considered to be generous in granting miracles and is in a glass case surrounded by toys given by the faithful to favors received. Every four years, when the [[FIFA World Cup]] is played, this image is dressed in the uniform of the [[Mexico national football team]], in the hopes that Mexico wins the cup.&lt;ref name="mlopez"&gt;{{cite news |title= El "Niño-Dios futbolista" de Tacuba |first= Manuel |last= López de la Parra  |url= http://www.informador.com.mx/editorial/2009/71159/6/el-nino-dios-futbolista-de-tacuba.htm |newspaper=El Informador |location=Guadalajara, Mexico |date=18 January 2010 |accessdate=January 20, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Niño Dios football player of Tacuba }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Santo Niño Doctor de los Enfermos''' is at a side altar in the parish of San Francisco de Asís en [[Tepeaca (municipality)|Tepeaca]], [[Puebla]]. The image is old but devotion to it is relatively recent. The image used to belong to a nun of the Concepción Béistegui Hospital in Mexico City. When the nun was transferred to Tepeaca, she brought the image with her and had it with her as she treated the sick. This image has had its own feast day at this church since 1961 on the 30 of April.&lt;ref name="arraigo"/&gt;

Other locally famous Niños Dios in Mexico City include the '''Niño Limosnerito''' in Colonia [[Santa Maria la Ribera]], the '''Santo Niño del Verbo Encarnado''' in Colonia Alfonso XIII, and the '''Santo Niño Muevo Corazones''' in Colonia Santa Tomás. This last image is credited with the conversion of many people to Catholicism.&lt;ref name="cjaramillo"/&gt; Outside of Mexico City, there are the [[Holy Infant of Good Health|Niño Jesús de la Salud]] in [[Morelia]], the '''Niño Milagroso''' de [[Tlaxcala, Tlaxcala|Tlaxcala]], the '''Niño Cieguito''' (Blind Child) in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]] (so called because it lacks eyes) and the [[Santo Niño de Atocha]] in [[Fresnillo]],&lt;ref name="arraigo"/&gt; the lasat a local version of a Spanish depiction.

'''Chinese painting''' is one of the oldest continuous artistic traditions in the world. Painting in the traditional style is known today in Chinese as ''guóhuà'' ({{zh|t=國畫|s=国画}}), meaning "national" or "native painting", as opposed to Western styles of art which became popular in China in the 20th century. Traditional painting involves essentially the same techniques as [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] and is done with a [[Ink and wash painting|brush dipped in black ink]] or [[Chinese pigment|coloured pigments]]; oils are not used. As with calligraphy, the most popular materials on which paintings are made are paper and silk. The finished work can be mounted on scrolls, such as [[hanging scroll]]s or [[handscroll]]s. Traditional painting can also be done on album sheets, walls, [[lacquerware]], [[folding screen]]s, and other media.

The two main techniques in Chinese painting are:
* [[Gongbi]] (工筆), meaning "meticulous", uses highly detailed brushstrokes that delimit details very precisely. It is often highly coloured and usually depicts figural or narrative subjects.  It is often practised by artists working for the royal court or in independent workshops.
* [[Ink and wash painting]], in Chinese ''shui-mo'' (水墨, "water and ink") also loosely termed watercolour or brush painting, and also known as "literati painting", as it was one of the "[[Four Arts]]" of the Chinese [[Scholar-official]] class.&lt;ref&gt;Sickman, 222&lt;/ref&gt; In theory this was an art practiced by gentlemen, a distinction that begins to be made in writings on art from the [[Song dynasty]], though in fact the careers of leading exponents could benefit considerably.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 114–119; Sickman, Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; This style is also referred to as "xieyi" (寫意) or freehand style.

[[Landscape painting]] was regarded as the highest form of Chinese painting, and generally still is.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 112&lt;/ref&gt;  The time from the Five Dynasties period to the Northern Song period (907–1127) is known as the "Great age of Chinese landscape".  In the north, artists such as [[Jing Hao]], [[Li Cheng (painter)|Li Cheng]], [[Fan Kuan]], and [[Guo Xi]] painted pictures of towering mountains, using strong black lines, ink wash, and sharp, dotted brushstrokes to suggest rough stone.  In the south, [[Dong Yuan]], [[Juran (painter)|Juran]], and other artists painted the rolling hills and rivers of their native countryside in peaceful scenes done with softer, rubbed brushwork.  These two kinds of scenes and techniques became the classical styles of Chinese landscape painting.

==Specifics and study==
Chinese painting and calligraphy distinguish themselves from other cultures' arts by emphasis on motion and change with dynamic life.&lt;ref name="Stanley-Barker 2010a"&gt;{{harv|Stanley-Baker|2010a|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is traditionally first learned by rote, in which the master shows the "right way" to draw items. The apprentice must copy these items strictly and continuously until the movements become instinctive.  In contemporary times, debate emerged on the limits of this copyist tradition within modern art scenes where innovation is the rule. Changing lifestyles, tools, and colors are also influencing new waves of masters.&lt;ref name="Stanley-Barker 2010a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanley-Barker 2010b"&gt;{{harv|Stanley-Baker|2010b|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early periods==
The earliest paintings were not representational but ornamental; they consisted of patterns or designs rather than pictures.  Early pottery was painted with spirals, zigzags, dots, or animals.  It was only during the [[Warring States period]] (475–221 BC) that artists began to represent the world around them.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} In imperial times (beginning with the [[Eastern Jin dynasty]]), painting and [[calligraphy]] in China were among the most highly appreciated arts in the court and they were often practiced by amateurs—aristocrats and scholar-officials—who had the leisure time necessary to perfect the technique and sensibility necessary for great brushwork. Calligraphy and painting were thought to be the purest forms of art. The implements were the [[Ink brush|brush pen]] made of animal hair, and [[Indian ink|black ink]]s made from pine soot and [[animal glue]]. In ancient times, writing, as well as painting, was done on [[silk]]. However, after the invention of paper in the 1st century AD, silk was gradually replaced by the new and cheaper material. Original writings by famous calligraphers have been greatly valued throughout China's history and are mounted on scrolls and hung on walls in the same way that paintings are.

Artists from the [[Han dynasty|Han]] (206 BC – 220 AD) to the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] (618–906) dynasties mainly painted the human figure.  Much of what we know of early Chinese figure painting comes from burial sites, where paintings were preserved on silk banners, lacquered objects, and tomb walls.  Many early tomb paintings were meant to protect the dead or help their souls to get to paradise.  Others illustrated the teachings of the Chinese philosopher [[Confucius]] or showed scenes of daily life.

[[Image:Luoshenfu Gu Kai Zhi.jpg|left|thumb|''Luoshenfu'' by [[Gu Kaizhi]] (344–406 AD)]]
During the [[Six Dynasties]] period (220–589), people began to appreciate painting for its own beauty and to write about art.  From this time we begin to learn about individual artists, such as [[Gu Kaizhi]].  Even when these artists illustrated Confucian moral themes – such as the proper behavior of a wife to her husband or of children to their parents – they tried to make the figures graceful.

===Six principles===
{{main|Six principles of Chinese painting}}
The "[[Six principles of Chinese painting]]" were established by [[Xie He (artist)|Xie He]], a writer, art historian and critic in 5th century China, in "Six points to consider when judging a painting" (繪畫六法, [[Pinyin]]: Huìhuà Liùfǎ), taken from the preface to his book "The Record of the Classification of Old Painters" (古畫品錄; [[Pinyin]]: Gǔhuà Pǐnlù).  Keep in mind that this was written circa 550 CE and refers to "old" and "ancient" practices.  The six elements that define a painting are:
[[Image:Zhang_Shengwen._L'enseignement_de_Bouddha_Sakyamuni.jpg|thumb|right|''The [[Sakyamuni]] [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]'', by Zhang Shengwen, 1173–1176 CE, [[Song dynasty]] ]]
[[Image:Figures in a cortege, tomb of Li Xian, Tang Dynasty.jpg|thumb|right|A mural painting of [[Li Xian (prince)|Li Xian]]'s tomb at the [[Qianling Mausoleum]], dated 706 CE, [[Tang dynasty]] ]]
# "Spirit Resonance", or vitality, which refers to the flow of energy that encompasses theme, work, and artist.  Xie He said that without Spirit Resonance, there was no need to look further.
# "Bone Method", or the way of using the brush, refers not only to texture and brush stroke, but to the close link between handwriting and personality.  In his day, the art of calligraphy was inseparable from painting.
# "Correspondence to the Object", or the depicting of form, which would include shape and line.
# "Suitability to Type", or the application of color, including layers, value, and tone.
# "Division and Planning", or placing and arrangement, corresponding to composition, space, and depth.
# "Transmission by Copying", or the copying of models, not from life only but also from the works of antiquity.

==Sui and Tang dynasties (581–907)==
{{Further|Tang dynasty painting}}
During the [[Tang dynasty]], figure painting flourished at the royal court.  Artists such as [[Zhou Fang (Tang dynasty)|Zhou Fang]] depicted the splendor of court life in paintings of emperors, palace ladies, and imperial horses.  Figure painting reached the height of elegant realism in the art of the court of Southern Tang (937–975).

Most of the Tang artists outlined figures with fine black lines and used brilliant color and elaborate detail.  However, one Tang artist, the master [[Wu Daozi]], used only black ink and freely painted brushstrokes to create ink paintings that were so exciting that crowds gathered to watch him work.  From his time on, ink paintings were no longer thought to be preliminary sketches or outlines to be filled in with color.  Instead, they were valued as finished works of art.

Beginning in the Tang Dynasty, many paintings were [[Landscape art|landscape]]s, often ''[[Shan shui|shanshui]]'' (山水, "mountain water") paintings. In these landscapes, [[monochrome|monochromatic]] and sparse (a style that is collectively called ''[[Ink and wash painting|shuimohua]]''), the purpose was not to reproduce the appearance of nature exactly ([[Realism (visual arts)|realism]]) but rather to grasp an emotion or atmosphere, as if catching the "rhythm" of nature.

==Liao, Song, Jin and Yuan dynasties (907–1368)==
[[Image:Deep Valley.jpg|thumb|left|[[Guo Xi]] is a representative landscape painter of the Northern Song dynasty, depicting mountains, rivers and forests in winter.

[[Image:Chinesischer Maler des 11. Jahrhunderts (I) 001.jpg|thumb|''Buddhist Temple in the Mountains'', 11th century, ink on silk, [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], Kansas City (Missouri).]]

Painting during the Song dynasty (960–1279) reached a further development of landscape painting; immeasurable distances were conveyed through the use of blurred outlines, mountain contours disappearing into the mist, and impressionistic treatment of natural phenomena. The ''[[shan shui]]'' style painting—"shan" meaning mountain, and "shui" meaning river—became prominent in Chinese landscape art. The emphasis laid upon landscape was grounded in [[Chinese philosophy]]; [[Taoism]] stressed that humans were but tiny specks in the vast and greater cosmos, while [[Neo-Confucianist]] writers often pursued the discovery of patterns and principles that they believed caused all social and natural phenomena.&lt;ref name="ebrey cambridge 162"&gt;Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 162.&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting of portraits and closely viewed objects like birds on branches were held in high esteem, but landscape painting was paramount.&lt;ref name="morton 104"&gt;Morton, 104.&lt;/ref&gt; By the beginning of the Song Dynasty a distinctive [[Northern Landscape style|landscape style]] had emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Barnhart, "Three Thousand Years of Chinese Painting", 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists mastered the formula of intricate and realistic scenes placed in the foreground, while the background retained qualities of vast and infinite space. Distant mountain peaks rise out of high clouds and mist, while streaming rivers run from afar into the foreground.&lt;ref name="morton 105"&gt;Morton, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file:Danfengyoulu.png|thumb|''Painting of maple and deer'' by [[Khitans]], [[National Palace Museum]], [[Taiwan]].]]
There was a significant difference in painting trends between the Northern Song period (960–1127) and Southern Song period (1127–1279). The paintings of Northern Song officials were influenced by their political ideals of bringing order to the world and tackling the largest issues affecting the whole of society; their paintings often depicted huge, sweeping landscapes.&lt;ref name="ebrey cambridge 163"&gt;Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 163.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Southern Song officials were more interested in reforming society from the bottom up and on a much smaller scale, a method they believed had a better chance for eventual success; their paintings often focused on smaller, visually closer, and more intimate scenes, while the background was often depicted as bereft of detail as a realm without concern for the artist or viewer.&lt;ref name="ebrey cambridge 163"/&gt; This change in attitude from one era to the next stemmed largely from the rising influence of [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] philosophy. Adherents to Neo-Confucianism focused on reforming society from the bottom up, not the top down, which can be seen in their efforts to promote small private academies during the Southern Song instead of the large state-controlled academies seen in the Northern Song era.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since the [[Southern and Northern dynasties]] (420–589), painting had become an art of high sophistication that was associated with the gentry class as one of their main artistic pastimes, the others being calligraphy and poetry.&lt;ref name="ebrey 81 83"&gt;Ebrey, 81–83.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Song Dynasty there were avid art collectors that would often meet in groups to discuss their own paintings, as well as rate those of their colleagues and friends. The poet and statesman [[Su Shi]] (1037–1101) and his accomplice [[Mi Fu]] (1051–1107) often partook in these affairs, borrowing art pieces to study and copy, or if they really admired a piece then an exchange was often proposed.&lt;ref name="ebrey 163"&gt;Ebrey, 163.&lt;/ref&gt; They created a new kind of art based upon the [[three perfections]] in which they used their skills in [[calligraphy]] (the art of beautiful writing) to make ink paintings.  From their time onward, many painters strove to freely express their feelings and to capture the inner spirit of their subject instead of describing its outward appearance.  The small round paintings popular in the Southern Song were often collected into albums as poets would write poems along the side to match the theme and mood of the painting.&lt;ref name="ebrey cambridge 163"/&gt;

[[Image:Four Generals of Song.jpg|thumb|right|The "Four Generals of Zhongxing" painted by Liu Songnian during the [[Song dynasty|Southern Song dynasty]]. [[Yue Fei]] is the second person from the left.

Although they were avid art collectors, some Song scholars did not readily appreciate artworks commissioned by those painters found at shops or common marketplaces, and some of the scholars even criticized artists from renowned schools and academies. Anthony J. Barbieri-Low, a Professor of Early Chinese History at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], points out that Song scholars' appreciation of art created by their peers was not extended to those who made a living simply as professional artists:&lt;ref name="barbieri low 2007 39 40"&gt;Barbieri-Low (2007), 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the Northern Song (960–1126 CE), a new class of scholar-artists emerged who did not possess the [[tromp l'œil]] skills of the academy painters nor even the proficiency of common marketplace painters. The literati's painting was simpler and at times quite unschooled, yet they would criticize these other two groups as mere professionals, since they relied on paid commissions for their livelihood and did not paint merely for enjoyment or self-expression. The scholar-artists considered that painters who concentrated on realistic depictions, who employed a colorful palette, or, worst of all, who accepted monetary payment for their work were no better than butchers or tinkers in the marketplace. They were not to be considered real artists.&lt;ref name="barbieri low 2007 39 40"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, during the Song period, there were many acclaimed court painters and they were highly esteemed by emperors and the [[royal family]]. One of the greatest landscape painters given patronage by the Song court was [[Zhang Zeduan]] (1085–1145), who painted the original ''[[Along the River During the Qingming Festival]]'' scroll, one of the most well-known masterpieces of Chinese visual art. [[Emperor Gaozong of Song]] (1127–1162) once commissioned an art project of numerous paintings for the ''[[Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute]]'', based on the woman poet [[Cai Wenji]] (177–250 AD) of the earlier [[Han dynasty]]. [[Yi Yuanji]]  achieved a high degree of realism painting animals, in particular [[monkey]]s and [[gibbon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert van Gulik]], "Gibbon in China. An essay in Chinese Animal Lore". The Hague, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Southern Song period (1127–1279), court painters such as [[Ma Yuan (painter)|Ma Yuan]] and [[Xia Gui]] used strong black brushstrokes to sketch trees and rocks and pale washes to suggest misty space.

During the [[Mongol]] [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368), painters joined the arts of painting, poetry, and calligraphy by inscribing poems on their paintings.  These three arts worked together to express the artist's feelings more completely than one art could do alone. Yuan emperor [[Tugh Temur]] (r. 1328, 1329–1332) was fond of Chinese painting and became a creditable painter himself.

Beginning in the 13th century, the tradition of painting simple subjects—a branch with fruit, a few flowers, or one or two horses—developed. Narrative painting, with a wider color range and a much busier composition than Song paintings, was immensely popular during the [[Ming Dynasty painting|Ming period]] (1368–1644).

The first books illustrated with colored woodcuts appeared around this time; as color-printing techniques were perfected, illustrated manuals on the art of painting began to be published. ''[[Jieziyuan Huazhuan]] (Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden)'', a five-volume work first published in 1679, has been in use as a technical textbook for artists and students ever since.

Some [[Ming Dynasty painting|painters of the Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644) continued the traditions of the Yuan scholar-painters.  This group of painters, known as the [[Wu School]], was led by the artist [[Shen Zhou]].  Another group of painters, known as the [[Zhe school (painting)|Zhe School]], revived and transformed the styles of the Song court.

[[Image:making farewells at Jingkou.jpg|thumb|[[Shen Zhou]] of the Wu School depicted the scene when the painter was making his farewell to Wu Kuan, a good friend of his, at Jingkou.]]

During the early [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911), painters known as Individualists rebelled against many of the traditional rules of painting and found ways to express themselves more directly through free brushwork.  In the 18th and 19th centuries, great commercial cities such as [[Yangzhou]] and [[Shanghai]] became art centers where wealthy merchant-patrons encouraged artists to produce bold new works. However, similar to the phenomenon of key lineages producing, many well-known artists came from established artistic families. Such families were concentrated in the [[Jiangnan]] region and produced painters such as [[Ma Quan]], [[Jiang Tingxi]], and [[Yun Zhu]].&lt;ref name=lan&gt;{{cite|title=清代绘画世家及其家学考略|trans-title=The aristocratic art families of the Qing and their learning|language=Chinese||author1=Lan Qiuyang 兰秋阳|author2=Xing Haiping 邢海萍|journal=Heibei beifang xueyuan xuebao (shehui kexue ban)|volume=25|issue=3|date=2009|page=24-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th and 20th centuries, Chinese painters were increasingly exposed to [[Western art history|Western art]].  Some artists who studied in Europe rejected Chinese painting; others tried to combine the best of both traditions. Among the most beloved modern painters was [[Qi Baishi]], who began life as a poor peasant and became a great master.  His best-known works depict flowers and small animals.

[[File:Li-tiefu-portrait-of-madame-liu.jpg|thumb|"Portrait of Madame Liu" (1942) [[Li Tiefu]]]]
Beginning with the [[New Culture Movement]], Chinese artists started to adopt using Western techniques. Prominent Chinese artists who studied Western painting include [[Li Tiefu]], [[Yan Wenliang]], [[Xu Beihong]], [[Lin Fengmian]], [[Fang Ganmin]] and [[Liu Haisu]].
[[File:法國沙龍1929.jpg|thumb|An ''Honourable Mention'' certificate [[Yan Wenliang]] received during his Paris years at the [[Salon d'Automne|''Salon de 1929'']]]]
In the early years of the [[People's Republic of China]], artists were encouraged to employ [[socialist realism]]. Some [[Soviet Union]] socialist realism was imported without modification, and painters were assigned subjects and expected to mass-produce paintings. This regimen was considerably relaxed in 1953, and after the [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]] of 1956–57, traditional Chinese painting experienced a significant revival. Along with these developments in professional art circles, there was a proliferation of peasant art depicting everyday life in the rural areas on wall murals and in open-air painting exhibitions.

During the [[Cultural Revolution]], art schools were closed, and publication of art journals and major art exhibitions ceased. Major destruction was also carried out as part of the elimination of [[Four Olds]] campaign.

===Since 1978===

Following the Cultural Revolution, art schools and professional organizations were reinstated. Exchanges were set up with groups of foreign artists, and Chinese artists began to experiment with new subjects and techniques.
One particular case of freehand style (xieyi hua) may be noted in the work of the child prodigy [[Wang Yani]] (born 1975) who started painting at age 3 and has since considerably contributed to the exercise of the style in contemporary artwork. 

After Chinese economic reform, more and more artists boldly conducted innovations in Chinese Painting. The innovations include: development of new brushing skill such as vertical direction splash water and ink, with representative artist Tiancheng Xie,&lt;ref&gt;宏然天成：谢天成泼墨山水技法,百度百科 http://baike.baidu.com/view/8312263.htm&lt;/ref&gt; creation of new style by integration traditional Chinese and Western painting techniques such as [[Heaven Style Painting]], with representative artist [[Shaoqiang Chen]],&lt;ref name="calligraphy reported-heaven school"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA5NDIyOTAxMQ==&amp;mid=202410242&amp;idx=5&amp;sn=df9425e9e28c8ef81651b5c9839209c4#rd|title=【社团风采】——"天堂画派"艺术家作品选刊("书法报·书画天地",2015年第2期第26–27版)|work=qq.com|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and new styles that express contemporary theme and typical nature scene of certain regions such as Lijiang Painting Style,with representative artist Gesheng Huang.&lt;ref&gt;漓江画派,百度百科 http://baike.baidu.com/view/200826.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 set of paintings by [[Cai Jin]], most well-known for her use of [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] colours, showed influences of both Western and traditional Chinese sources, though the paintings were organic abstractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodman|first1=Jonathan|title=Cai Jin: Return to the Source|url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/2013/07/artseen/cai-jin-return-to-the-source|publisher=Brooklyn Rail|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chouinard Art Institute''' was a professional [[art school]] founded in 1921 by [[Nelbert Chouinard|Nelbert Murphy Chouinard]] (1879–1969) in [[Los Angeles, California]]. In 1961, [[Walt Disney|Walt]] and [[Roy O. Disney|Roy Disney]] guided the merger of the Chouinard Art Institute and the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music to establish the [[California Institute of the Arts]].&lt;ref name=Calarts&gt;{{cite web|url= http://calarts.edu/about/history/chouinard|title= History of Chouinard Art Institute at Calarts|accessdate=2014-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded by artist and educator Nelbert Murphy Chouinard in 1921 with the goal of creating a renowned art school on the West Coast,&lt;ref name="Calarts"/&gt; the school grew during the subsequent decades and in 1935 it was recognized by the California state government as a non-profit educational facility.&lt;ref name="Calarts"/&gt; In 1929, [[Walt Disney]] began driving his inexperienced animators to the school for Friday night classes, a tradition that would continue for many years.&lt;ref name="Vintage Books"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gabler|first1=Neal|title=Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination|date=2006|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-0-679-75747-4|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several years later Disney hired a Chouinard teacher named Donald Graham to teach more formal classes on studio property.&lt;ref name="Vintage Books"/&gt;  Chouinard would later be used by Disney as a breeding ground for artists for [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarves (1937 film)|''Snow White and the Seven Dwarves'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gabler|first1=Neal|title=Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination|date=2006|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-0-679-75747-4|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1950s Mrs. Chouinard had a stroke and could not run the school; in gratitude for letting his animators study there, Walt Disney supported the school financially and took over administrative duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gabler|first1=Neal|title=Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination|date=2006|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-0-679-75747-4|page=591}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also attempted to expand the school into what he called a "City of the Arts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gabler|first1=Neal|title=Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination|date=2006|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-0-679-75747-4|page=592}}&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually led to the merger of Chouinard and Los Angeles Conservatory of Music into the [[California Institute of the Arts]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="Calarts"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The Chouinard Art Institute building is situated at 743 Grand View Street in the [[Westlake, Los Angeles|Westlake district]] of [[central Los Angeles]]. Today it is used by the Western Day Care School, a child-care center.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;Mike Boehm (April 15, 2014), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-chouinard-art-institute-film-documentary-walt-disney-ruscha-siqueioros-20140414,0,5818782.story L.A.'s Chouinard Art Institute chronicled in new documentary film] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dave Tourjé, who became fascinated by the institute's history after buying and restoring Nelbert Chouinard’s 1907 home in [[South Pasadena, California]], helped to establish the '''Chouinard Foundation''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davetourje.com/bio Artist biography of Dave Tourjé website.]&lt;/ref&gt; which produced a 2001 retrospective exhibition and gave art classes, first in its own building and then under contract with the City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks. Since 2009, when funding for the art classes ran out, Tourje has focused on keeping the Chouinard name alive, including a Chouinard Foundation website with archival material.

Produced and directed by Gianina Ferreyra in 2013, the 51-minute documentary film ''Curly'' addresses the school’s history from 1921 to 1972, including interviews with artists [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Laddie John Dill]], [[Llyn Foulkes]], [[Joe Goode]], [[Ed Ruscha]], and [[Peter Shire]], among others. &lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt;

'''Cornelius Cardew''' (7 May 1936{{spaced ndash}}13 December 1981) was an English [[experimental music]] [[composer]], and founder (with [[Howard Skempton]] and [[Michael Parsons (composer)|Michael Parsons]]) of the [[Scratch Orchestra (musical ensemble)|Scratch Orchestra]], an experimental performing ensemble. He later rejected experimental music, explaining why he had "discontinued composing in an avantgarde idiom" in his own programme notes to his Piano Album 1973{{Full citation needed|date=March 2013}}&lt;!--What sort of publication is this (sheet-music collection, LP album, recital programme book), where published, and by whom?--&gt; in favour of a politically motivated "people's liberation music".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;!--Citation is needed for the distinction between "people's liberation music" and "experimental music", as well as for Cardew's apostacy from the latter.--&gt;

==Biography==
Cardew was born in [[Winchcombe]], [[Gloucestershire]]. He was the second of three sons whose parents were both artists—his father was the potter [[Michael Cardew]]. The family moved to [[Wenford Bridge Pottery]] [[Cornwall]] a few years after his birth where he was later accepted as a pupil by the Canterbury Cathedral School which had evacuated to the area during the war due to bombing. His musical career thus began as a chorister. From 1953 to 1957, Cardew studied piano, cello, and composition at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London.

===Career===
Having won a scholarship to study at the recently established [[Studio for Electronic Music (WDR)|Studio for Electronic Music]] in Cologne, Cardew served as an assistant to [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] from 1958 to 1960. He was given the task of independently working out the composition plans for the German composer's score ''[[Carré (Stockhausen)|Carré]]'', and Stockhausen noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As a musician he was outstanding because he was not only a good pianist but also a good improviser and I hired him to become my assistant in the late 50s and he worked with me for over three years. I gave him work to do which I have never given to any other musician, which means to work with me on the score I was composing. He was one of the best examples that you can find among musicians because he was well informed about the latest theories of composition as well as being a performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnow.co.uk/composers/cardew.html|title=Cornelius Cardew—Composer|author=Brigid Scott Baker|work=musicnow.co.uk|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most of Cardew's compositions from this period make use of the integral and total serialist languages pioneered by Boulez and Stockhausen.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In 1959, Cardew performed in the first British performance of [[Pierre Boulez]]'s ''[[Le marteau sans maître]]'' at Dartington International Summer School of Music (having learnt to play the guitar for the occasion as no professional guitar player was available).{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

====Indeterminacy and the American experimentalists====
In 1958, Cardew witnessed a series of concerts in Cologne by [[John Cage]] and [[David Tudor]] which had a considerable influence on him, leading him to abandon post-Schönbergian [[serial composition]] and develop the indeterminate and experimental scores for which he is best known. He was particularly prominent in introducing the works of American experimental composers such as [[Morton Feldman]], [[La Monte Young]], [[Earle Brown]], [[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]], and Cage to an English audience during the early to mid sixties and came to have a considerable impact on the development of English music from the late sixties onwards.

Cardew's most important scores from his experimental period are ''[[Treatise (music)|Treatise]]'' (1963–67), a 193-page [[Graphic notation (music)|graphic score]] which allows for considerable freedom of interpretation, and ''[[The Great Learning (music)|The Great Learning]]'', a work in seven parts or "Paragraphs," based on translations of [[Confucius]] by [[Ezra Pound]]. ''The Great Learning'' instigated the formation of the Scratch Orchestra. During those years, he took a course in graphic design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.composer.co.uk/composers/cardew.html|title=Cornelius Cardew—Composer|author=Brigid Scott Baker|work=composer.co.uk|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he made his living as a graphic designer at Aldus Books in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n05/richard-gott/liberation-music/print|title=Richard Gott reviews ‘Cornelius Cardew’ by John Tilbury · LRB 12 March 2009|work=London Review of Books|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Cardew joined the [[free improvisation]] group [[AMM (group)|AMM]] as cellist and pianist. AMM had formed the previous year and included English jazz musicians [[Lou Gare]], [[Eddie Prévost]], [[Keith Rowe]], and one of his first students at the Royal Academy [[Christopher Hobbs]]. Performing with the group allowed Cardew to explore music in a completely democratic environment, freely improvising without recourse to scores.

While teaching an experimental music class at London's [[Morley College]] in 1968, Cardew, along with Howard Skempton and Michael Parsons formed the [[Scratch Orchestra]], a large experimental ensemble, initially for the purposes of interpreting Cardew's ''The Great Learning''. The Scratch Orchestra gave performances throughout Britain and elsewhere until its demise in 1972. It was during this period that the question of ''art for whom'' was hotly debated within the context of the Orchestra, which Cardew came to see as elitist despite its numerous attempts to make socially accessible music.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Timothy D., (Author). "Moving in Decency: The Music And Radical Politics Of Cornelius Cardew." Music &amp; Letters 79.4 (1998): 555. RILM Abstracts of Music Literature. Web. 13 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political involvements===
After the demise of the Orchestra, Cardew became more directly involved in left-wing politics and abandoned avant-garde music altogether, adopting a populist though post-romantic tonal style. He spent 1973 in [[West Berlin]] on an artist's grant from the City, where he was active in a campaign for a children's clinic. During the 1970s, he produced many songs, often drawing from traditional English folk music put at the service of lengthy [[Marxism|Marxist]]-[[Maoism|Maoist]] exhortations; representative examples are ''Smash the [[Social Contract]]'' and ''There Is Only One Lie, There Is Only One Truth''. In 1974, he published a book entitled ''Stockhausen Serves Imperialism'', which denounced, in Maoist [[self-criticism|self-critical]] style, his own involvement with Stockhausen and the Western avant-garde tradition.

Cardew was active in various causes in British politics, such as the struggle against the revival of neo-Nazi groups in Britain, and subsequently was involved in the [[People's Liberation Music]] group with [[Laurie Scott Baker]], [[John Marcangelo]], Vicky Silva, [[Hugh Shrapnel]], [[Keith Rowe]] and others. The group developed and performed music in support of various popular causes including benefits for striking miners and Northern Ireland.

Cardew became a member of the [[Communist Party of England (Marxist-Leninist)]] in the 1970s, and in 1979 was a co-founder and member of the Central Committee of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Britain (Marxist-Leninist)]]. His creative output from the demise of the Scratch Orchestra until his death reflected his political commitment. Cardew stated his attitude towards the avant-garde in ''Stockhausen Serves Imperialism'':

Cardew's efforts to politicise culture in Britain were influenced by his relationship with [[Hardial Bains]], the Canadian communist leader and a leading [[anti-revisionist]] politician. Bains contributed the lyrics to Cardew's signature song from his later period, ''We Sing for the Future''.

===Death===
Cardew died on 13 December 1981, the victim of a hit-and-run car accident near his London home in [[Leyton]]. The driver was never found.

Musician [[John Tilbury]], in his book ''Cornelius Cardew—A Life Unfinished'' suggests that the possibility that Cardew was killed because of his prominent Marxist-Leninist involvement "cannot be ruled out".&lt;ref&gt;Tilbury 2008, 1022.&lt;/ref&gt; Tilbury quotes a friend of Cardew's, John Maharg; "MI5 are quite ruthless; people don't realise it. And they kill pre-emptively".&lt;ref&gt;Tilbury 2008, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 70th Birthday Anniversary Festival, including live music from all phases of Cardew's career and a symposium on his music, took place on 7 May 2006 at the Cecil Sharp House in London.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2818">'''Creative Partnerships''' was the UK government's flagship creative learning programme, established in 2002 as part of the Council's SR2000 settlement to develop young people's creativity through artists' engagement with schools in nominated areas across England. Following the 2010 election of the coalition government, funding was cut by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and Arts Council England in 2011, with activity in schools ending in summer 2011.

==Aim==
It aimed to build sustainable learning partnerships between schools, creative and cultural organisations and individuals.

==Methods==
Creative Partnerships facilitated many long-term links between schools and creative professionals, such as artists, architects, scientists and multimedia developers. Research reports covering many different aspects of the programme, conducted by researchers from a number of universities and consultancies, are available online. Reports include literature reviews about creativity and education, teacher identity, pupil wellbeing and tracking progression in creativity; evaluations and surveys of the programme; and qualitative research investigating pedagogy, wellbeing and progression.  https://archive.is/20131017205459/http://www.creativitycultureeducation.org/tag/research

== Who delivered Creative Partnerships? ==
Between 2002 - 2009, local Arts Council offices delivered the programme in 36 areas of England. Peter Jenkinson OBE was the first national director of the programme and he was succeeded by Paul Collard. 
Between 2009 - 2011, responsibility for Creative Partnership was transferred to [[Creativity, Culture and Education]].  Creativity, Culture and Education, chaired by Paul Roberts with Paul Collard as CEO, funded 25 organisations to deliver Creative Partnerships in their local area. These were a range of independent and ‘host’ cultural organisations, with many of the individuals working there transferring from Arts Council England.

==Funding==
The organisation was managed by [[Arts Council England]] and funded by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport with additional funding from the Department for Education. It was finally managed by [[Creativity, Culture and Education]] (CCE).

The '''''Cristo Yacente (Dead Christ) of El Pardo''''', is a life-size polychromed sculpture by Spanish sculptor [[Gregorio Fernández]], executed between 1614 and 1615. Housed in a chapel of the Capuchin Monastery of [[El Pardo]] (Madrid), the sculpture was commissioned by King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] to celebrate the birth of his son Philip IV.

The ''Cristo yacente of El Pardo'' is the most famous of the fourteen ''"Cristos"'' produced by Fernández and his workshop.

As  devotional images, many of them were processed during [[Holy Week]] with other “[[paso]]s” (elaborate religious floats adorned with sculptures depicting scenes from the Passion of Christ). All these images were created in accordance with [[Counter-Reformation]] ideology that required realism in religious images to impress and move the believer.

[[Old Irish]] ''cín'', derived from the Latin ''quinio'' "five", was a small book made of five folded [[vellum]] leaves; ''lebor'', modern Irish ''leabhar'', is the standard word for a book.&lt;ref&gt;Dáibhí Ó Cróinín, ''Early Medieval Ireland'', Longman, 1995, pp. 172-173&lt;/ref&gt; It is "named from the place of its origin or preservation, namely Druim(m) Snechta (Drumsnat, [[County Monaghan]]), where a monastery had been founded in the sixth century."&lt;ref&gt;Thomás Ó Concheanainn, "A Connacht Medieval Literary Heritage: Texts derived from ''Cín Dromma Snechtai'' through ''Lebor na hUidre''",  ''Cambridge Medieval Celtic Studies'' 16, Winter 1988, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
[[Geoffrey Keating]] was aware of the book, although he does not seem to have had access to it himself in compiling his ''[[Foras Feasa ar Éirinn]]'',&lt;ref name=koch&gt;John T. Koch, ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1'', ABC-Clio, 2006, pp. 437-438&lt;/ref&gt; and believed it dated to before the arrival of [[Saint Patrick]].&lt;ref&gt;David Comyn and Patrick S. Dinneen (eds.), ''The History of Ireland by Geoffrey Keating, D.D.'', Vol. 1, 1902, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th-century scholar [[Eugene O'Curry]] found a marginal note in the [[Book of Leinster]], partly illegible, which said that the ''Cín'' was compiled by a son of Dauí, king of Connacht. O'Curry favoured Ernín, son of Dauí Galach, a nephew of [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]] and a contemporary of Patrick, but allowed that it may have been a son of [[Dauí Tenga Uma]], a king of Connacht who died at the end of the fifth century&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene O'Curry]], ''Lectures on the Manuscript Materials of Ancient Irish History'', Dublin: James Duffy, 1861, pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Francis J. Byrne]] believes the two kings were in fact the same person).&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis J. Byrne]], ''Irish Kings and High-Kings'', Four Courts Press, second edition, 2001, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolf Thurneysen]], who made a convincing reconstruction of its contents in 1912-13, proposed a date in the early 8th century for the writing of the book. Other scholars have proposed dates in the 9th or 10th century, although these are disputed. It is cited as a source by many of the most important early Irish manuscripts, including ''[[Lebor na hUidre]]'', the Book of Leinster, the [[Book of Ballymote]], the [[Great Book of Lecan]], and the MS Egerton 88.&lt;ref name=koch /&gt;

Texts believed to originate from the ''Cín Dromma Snechtai'' are notable for their archaic language, and include:&lt;ref name=koch /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Carney, "Language and Literature to 1169", in Dáibhí Ó Cróinín, ''A New History of Ireland Vol 1: Prehistoric and Early Ireland'', Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 451-510&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edwards Villa''' is a building located in [[Bornova]], [[İzmir]]. It currently serves as a [[Ege University|university]] cafeteria and social communication centre.

==History==
Edwards Villa was built by the Edwards Family in 1880, at which time it became the family's own residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ege.edu.tr/index.php?lid=1&amp;SayfaID=299&amp;cat=details |title=Ege Universitesi |publisher=Ege.edu.tr |date= |accessdate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Charles Edwards passed away, the villa was given the name "Murat Villa". 

In 1980, it was expropriated by the local government and the İzmir Province Vulnerable Child Protection Union. In 1983, it was transferred to the Social Services Society for the Protection of Children General Directorate. 

In 2001, The Society for the Protection of Children and Izmir Metropolitan Municipality started a project to comprehensively restore the villa. The project lasted fifteen years. After restoration in 2005, it was given to the [[Ege University]] and currently serves as a cafeteria and a community center.

==Location==
The villa is located on the opposite side of an [[Anglican Church]], at the corner of [[Central Boulevard]] and Flower Street.

==Architecture==
The [[façade]] is symmetrical about the central plane. This symmetry is accentuated by double entry doors. 

The porch is surrounded by [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]] and approached by double-arm stairs. The stairs on the porch open the southern façade of the main hall and are reminiscent of the Italian architecture used in the entire structure, especially in the front parts.

The porch is a specimen of late Italian civil architecture. 

==Interior==

The interior of the building has several ornaments made out of plaster and wood. 

The ceilings have various eye-catching motifs of animals such as lions and dragons. The ground floor hall is adorned with black-and-white marble plaques, intricate niches and large wooden doors. The fireplace is made out of cast iron. The first floor rooms are decorated simply in stark contrast with the hall's ornate ceiling centers. 

A low-arched transition element is made of plasters and wood. 

The restoration process involved stripping the plaster and the cladding from the basement and covering the chimney with bricks, as well as replacing the lighting fixtures, which left the architecture inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;Hümeyra BİROL AKKURT, 19.YUZYIL BATILAŞMA KESITINDE, BORNOVA VE BUCA LEVANTEN KOSKLERI MEKANSAL KİMLIGININ IRDELENMESİ, Dokuz Eylul University, Instıtute of Science, PhD Thesis, Department of Architecture, Restoration Program, 2004-March, Izmir, pg.144-149&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Eretz Nehederet''''' ({{lang-he|ארץ נהדרת}}; ''lit.'' A Wonderful Country) is a [[satirical]] [[Israel]]i [[television show]], which made its debut on November 7, 2003. It features satirical references to current affairs of the past week through parodies of the people involved, as well as the thoughts of recurring characters. The program's concept is inspired by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and others. The program is one of the most watched and influential shows on [[Israeli TV]].&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|last=Flower |first=Kevin|title=Israeli TV show attacks taboos with humor|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/05/18/israel.humor/index.html?hpt=C1|publisher=CNN|date=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the longest-running scripted shows in Israeli television to date, running for 15 seasons as of 2017. Beginning with Season 15, the program is aired on [[Keshet 12]], in [[HDTV]].

It was first filmed in [[Tel Aviv]], and in later seasons, was filmed in the neighboring [[Herzliya]].

The show features a regular cast of comedians and actors, including [[Tal Friedman]], [[Eyal Kitzis]] (the [[Jon Stewart]]-type host), [[Alma Zak]], [[Orna Banai]] (6 first seasons), [[Shani Cohen]], [[Asi Cohen]], [[Eli Finish]], [[Mariano Edelman]], [[Yuval Semo]], [[Roey Bar-Natan]], [[Eran Zarachovitch]], [[Yaron Berlad]], [[Maor Cohen]] and [[Dov Navon]] (4 first seasons). During the third season, [[Asi Cohen]] started doing small roles on the show, and by the beginning of the fourth season (fall 2006), Cohen became a regular member.

''Eretz Nehederet'' won the Israeli Television Academy's "Best Entertainment Program" in 2004 and again in 2006, and attracts millions of viewers every season. In a May 2008 poll, web surfers selected all the Season 5 Eretz Nehederet actors from into the top 60 Israeli comedians list. The top 7 spots were all taken by Eretz Nehederet, as well as #9 and #20.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3540281,00.html|title=Asi Cohen the Funniest in Israel, Again|publisher=[[Ynet]]|date=2008-05-07|accessdate=2008-05-08|author=Barne'a, Or|author2=Shiloni, Smadar|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Erez Nehederet produced a satire feature film called ''[[Zohi Sdom]]'' (''lit.'' This is [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]).

==Notable sketches==
[[File:Angry-birds-peace-treaty.jpg|thumb|right|[[Angry Birds Peace Treaty]] shot. A moment before the talks break badly.]]
*In May 2010, a sketch played off tensions between [[Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and [[American President]] [[Barack Obama]], with Netanyahu trying to smooth over differences as they meet in the [[White House]]. A series of accidents caused Netanyahu to set the American flag on fire, stomp on it, and then torch a copy of Obama's proposed Middle East peace plan.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

'''''EuroTrump''''' is a 90-minute long documentary, which follows [[Geert Wilders]]' campaign for Prime Minister of the Netherlands during the [[Dutch general election, 2017]] and compares him to the U.S. president [[Donald Trump]]. It was directed by [[Stephen Robert Morse]] and [[Nick Hampson]], and co-written by Morse and [[Maria Spinger]]. 

== Background and production ==
Geert Wilders, a right-wing politician in the [[Netherlands]], decided to run for [[Prime Minister]] of the [[Netherlands]] in the [[Dutch general election, 2017]]. Stephen Robert Morse was fascinated by this, particularly after American politician [[Donald Trump]]'s successful presidential election and the [[United Kingdom]] leaving the [[European Union]]. He, along with Nick Hampson and Maria Springer, decided to make a documentary which follows Wilders campaign, and compares him to Donald Trump.&lt;ref name="sbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/news/eurotrump-documentary-mba-alumni-airs-tv|title=EuroTrump documentary by MBA alumni airs on TV|work=Oxford University Saïd Business School|date=June 29, 2018|accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Wilders’ was the first big election in the world after Trump, which is what drew us to the project in the first place. We wanted to make a movie about an election that involved an outsider, someone from the traditional right wing," Hampson said.&lt;ref name="observer"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Kelsey |title='EUROTRUMP' Documentary Provides Inside Look at Geert Wilders |url=https://observer.com/2017/10/documentary-eurotrump-provides-inside-look-at-geert-wilders/ |accessdate=5 October 2018 |work=[[The New York Observer]] |publisher=Joseph Meyer |date=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Robert Morse]] and [[Nick Hampson]] co-directed the documentary, and [[Maria Spinger]] co-wrote it. The soundtrack was composed by Harry Davidson, a music scholar from the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name="sbs"/&gt;

The filming began in December 2016, a couple of days after a trial where Wilders was convicted of hate speech, which concluded with the judge, Hendrik Steenhuis, deciding that the court would not impose any punishment on Wilders following the trial.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Persio |first1=Sofia Lotto |title=Is Geert Wilders Really The Dutch Donald?

The Dutch press were not supportive of the documentary; however, Morse stated, "I think that’s an ignorant approach. You should try understand the people who disagree with. If you don't have an in-depth understanding of someone it makes it very challenging to understand their viewpoint, if you don't understand where those views came from."&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; Morse stated that throughout the whole production time span, the production team applied the lessons they learned at the [[Saïd Business School]].&lt;ref name="sbs"/&gt; Morse thought that even though Wilders' had such strong beliefs politically,  he was a likeable person; at their first meeting for the documentary, Wilders' and Morse made each other laugh often, despite Morse expecting Wilders' to be "a monster."&lt;ref name="observer"/&gt;

The documentary follows Wilders' campaign and provides an up-close view of him, discussing what his ideas are politically, including clearing Islam from the [[Netherlands]] and shutting down all [[mosques]],&lt;ref name="observer"/&gt; as well as providing information about himself, such as talking about his two cats and describing himself as a "spoilt child."&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; The documentary also discusses how Wilders' constantly has strict security around him, and how it affects him.&lt;ref name="observer"/&gt; Morse describes the comparison between Wilders and Trump as ironic, due to how little they have in common.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; Morse thought that his work producing ''[[Amanda Knox]]'' allowed Wilders to trust him more; many journalists would have a much more difficult time getting up-close to Wilders.&lt;ref name="sbs"/&gt; The show premiered on [[Hulu]] in June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cohn |first1=Gabe |title=What’s on TV Monday: ‘The Rape of Recy Taylor’ and ‘Strangers’ |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/02/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday-the-rape-of-recy-taylor-and-strangers.html |accessdate=5 October 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[A.G.

The '''Frari Triptych''' or '''Pesaro Triptych''' is a 1488 oil on panel [[triptych]] painting by [[Giovanni Bellini]]. It is signed and dated 1488 on the centre of the Virgin Mary's throne, though it may have taken several years to produce, meaning he started it in 1485.&lt;ref&gt;Fry&lt;/ref&gt; On the reverse is a label dating its completion more precisely, to 15 February 1488.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Anchise Tempestini, ''Giovanni Bellini'', Catalogo Completo, Cantini, Firenze 1992. {{ISBN|88-7737-105-6}}, Kat. 60, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the [[basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari]] in [[Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Mariolina Olivari, ''Giovanni Bellini'', in AA.VV., ''Pittori del Rinascimento'', Scala, Firenze 2007. {{ISBN|88-8117-099-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its central scene is the Madonna and Child enthroned with two angel musicians, flanked to the left by [[saint Nicholas of Bari]] and [[saint Peter]] and to the right by [[saint Mark]] (patron of Venice) and [[saint Benedict]]. The work's division into compartments is rather old-fashioned and may have been explicitly demanded by the commissioner, but Bellini uses this to his advantage, integrating the painted architecture with the frame, which he designed himself. This develops the illusionism of his [[San Giobbe Altarpiece]], again placing the Virgin in a deep blue mantle on a high marble throne, using a golden light and a Byzanto-Venetian-style apse. To the sides thin strips of landscape suggest a vast space behind the work, whilst the [[trompe l'oeil]] apse behind the Virgin bears an inscription reading &lt;small&gt;IANUA CERTA POLI DUC MENTEM DIRIGE VITAM: QUAE PERAGAM COMMISSA TUAE SINT OMNIA CURAE&lt;/small&gt; ("Certain gate of heaven, guide [my] mind, direct [my] life: may everything I do be entrusted to your care").&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Rona Goffen, ''Devozione e committenza.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3599">'''Genreflecting''' is the process of examining and analyzing the patterns and characteristics of [[literary genre]]s—both [[fiction]] and recreational [[Non-fiction|nonfiction]]—and using that analysis to identify titles with similar appeals to readers (i.e., read-alikes), in order to make reading suggestions to individuals who are looking for something to read.

The term "genreflecting" was first coined by Betty Rosenberg, a prominent [[library science]] educator, in 1982.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Genreflecting: A Guide to Reading Interests in Genre Fiction|last=Rosenberg|first=Betty|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=1982|isbn=978-0872873339|location=Littleton, CO|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that time, the term has been adopted by [[readers' advisory]] in [[Library|libraries]] and extended to [[Non-fiction|nonfiction]] genres as well as fiction. A similar practice in retail bookstores is called "hand-selling."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.booklistonline.com/Retail-Approach-or-Library-Approach-Shaping-Readers-Advisory-John-Schoppert/pid=5938363|title=Retail Approach or Library Approach? Shaping Readers' Advisory, by John  Schoppert {{!}} Booklist Online|website=www.booklistonline.com|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
At the time the first edition of Rosenberg's ''Genreflecting'' was written, adding popular reading materials to library collections and recommending those titles to readers were controversial practices. Dr. Rosenberg's First Law of Reading—"Never apologize for your reading taste"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;—has since been adopted by growing numbers of [[librarian]]s, and the field of [[readers' advisory]] has become increasingly central to the practice of [[Library science|librarianship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2014/02/library-services/the-state-of-readers-advisory/#_|title=The State of Readers’ Advisory|newspaper=Library Journal|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nancy Pearl]], the well known model of the librarian [[action figure]] and author of ''[[Book Lust]]'' and ''More Book Lust,'' has promoted and further popularized the practice of readers' advisory within the library community and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://litreactor.com/columns/readers-advisory-expert-advice-on-what-to-read-next|title=Library Love: Reader’s Advisory - Expert Advice On What To Read Next|newspaper=LitReactor|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, a number of [[online database]]s have been developed to assist readers' advisors find "read-alikes," including ''What Do I Read Next?'' (Gale Thomson), ''NoveList'' ([[EBSCO Information Services|EBSCO]]), ''The Reader's Advisor Online'' ([[Greenwood Publishing Group]]), ''Fiction Connection'' (Bowker), and ''Booklist Online'' ([[American Library Association]]).

Harry Männil was born into an iron salesman's family on May 17, 1920, in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]], and spent his childhood in [[Pääsküla]], Tallinn.&lt;ref name="ekspress"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epl"&gt;{{cite news|last=Eilart|first=Andres|title=Costa Ricas suri tuntud väliseestlane Harry Männil|url=http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/486178|accessdate=18 August 2010|newspaper=Eesti Päevaleht|date=13 January 2010|language=Estonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[Gustav Adolf Grammar School]] in 1938 and from 1939–40 studied economics at the [[University of Tartu]] and the [[Tallinn University of Technology]].&lt;ref name="ekspress"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ekspress.ee/news/paevauudised/vanakuld/in-memoriam-harry-mannil-sonnenfeldi-needus.d?id=28446343|title=Sonnenfeldi needus|first=Pekka|last=Erelt|date=January 5, 2006|newspaper=Eesti Ekspress|language=Estonian|accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1941, during the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Soviet occupation]], he hid in a forest to avoid the [[mobilization]].&lt;ref name="ekspress"/&gt; Männil joined the [[political police]] of the [[Estonian Self-Administration]] as an assistant in September 1941. He held the position until June 10, 1942, when he was fired for unknown reasons.&lt;ref name="ekspress"/&gt; This period of collaboration with the Nazi government would later lead to Männil being accused of [[war crimes]]. After being relieved, Männil continued his studies at the University of Tartu.

In October 1943 he escaped to [[Finland]] when the [[Sicherheitsdienst|German Security Service]] began to consider him politically dangerous as a student leader at the university.&lt;ref name="ekspress"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nacion"&gt;{{cite news|last=Männil|first=Harry|title=Soy un empresario honorable|url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2007/junio/03/opinion1118307.html|newspaper=La Nación|date=June 3, 2007|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Finland he studied business management in [[Helsinki]].&lt;ref name=kaevats&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaevats |first=Ülo |title=Eesti Entsüklopeedia 14 |year=2000 |publisher=Tallinn: Eesti Entsüklopeediakirjastus |isbn=9985-70-064-3 |page= 313}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Männil was accused by a local police official of illegal trade in gold and valuables brought to Finland by Estonian refugees. These claims were, however, denied by Männil.&lt;ref name="ekspress"/&gt;

Männil moved to [[Sweden]] in September 1944 with the intention of continuing his studies. He stayed at a [[refugee camp]] for a short while. Soon he received a [[residence permit]] to live in Stockholm and a [[working permit]] that allowed him to take a job at an archive. In November 1944, a complaint regarding Männil's Nazi involvement was filed at the Swedish Commission of Foreigners, and he was investigated by the [[Sandler Commission]].&lt;ref name="ekspress"/&gt;&lt;ref name="megafeature"/&gt; The relative ease with which Männil received his work and residence permits raised the suspicions of the local authorities. In September 1945, he was fired from his job at the request of the Commission of Foreigners. A month later, an extension to his residence permit was declined.&lt;ref name="ekspress"/&gt; Männil was allowed to stay in Stockholm to make preparations  for his emigration to [[Venezuela]], and an extension was granted on his residence permit a short while later. After Männil was denied a [[transit visa]] to Britain, the Swedish authorities pressured him to leave the country.&lt;ref name="megafeature"&gt;{{cite news|title=MEGA FEATURE: Senjoor Harri Männil|url=http://www.epl.ee/?artikkel=152356|accessdate=10 October 2010|newspaper=Eesti Päevaleht|date=March 21, 2001|language=Estonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Venezuela (1946–2010)===
When Männil arrived in [[Maracaibo]], Venezuela, in February 1946,&lt;ref name="ekspress"/&gt; he described himself as "penniless".&lt;ref name="Coronil"&gt;{{cite book |last=Coronil |first=Fernando |title=The magical state: nature, money, and modernity in Venezuela |year=1997 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecTWdRNSJCcC&amp;pg=PA310 |isbn=978-0-226-11602-0 |pages=310–312 |chapter=Deere, ACO, and Harry Mannil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liivrand"&gt;{{cite news|title=Harry Männil: Aastas kulub kunsti peale 100 000 dollarit|url=http://www.ekspress.ee/news/paevauudised/vanakuld/ee-1997-harry-mannil-aastas-kulub-kunsti-peale-100-000-dollarit.d?id=28447739|newspaper=Eesti Ekspress|accessdate=17 August 2010|author=Liivrand, Harry|author2=Mõtsar, Selle|language=Estonian|date=September 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had traveled there under an employment contract to work for the enterprise headed by Juan Mendiri in Maracaibo and which later became part of BECO.  He joined  [[BECO]], a department store founded in 1942 and owned by Blohms, a family of German descent.&lt;ref name="Coronil"/&gt;  Beco was bought out by a group of investors headed by Arnold Orav together with Juan Simon Mendoza (co-founder of Venezuela's largest business empire, the Polar Group), and a couple of other Estonians, who, like Männil, were members of the [[corporation (university)|academic corporation]] [[Korporatsioon Vironia|Vironia]].&lt;ref name="Tattar"&gt;{{cite news|last=Erelt|first=Pekka|title=Mees, kes tegi Harry Männilist miljonäri|url=http://www.ekspress.ee/news/paevauudised/eestiuudised/article.php?id=28632309|accessdate=17 August 2010|newspaper=Eesti Ekspress|date=22 January 2010|language=Estonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnold Carl Orav, Chmn, split from BECO in 1951 to form [[ACO Group]], a company that would eventually control over one-sixth of Venezuela's automotive trade.&lt;ref name="11-kultuuritegelast"/&gt; Männil received Venezuelan citizenship in 1952.&lt;ref name="EPL-Costa-Rica"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arileht.ee/artikkel/227153|title=Costa Rica ei luba Männilit natsimineviku pärast riiki|date=February 6, 2003|newspaper=Eesti Päevaleht|language=Estonian|accessdate=14 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720125308/http://www.arileht.ee/artikkel/227153|archivedate=20 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Männil assumed the title of Chmn, in addition to CEO of the ACO Group,  It emerged in the 1970s as the world's largest [[tractor]] dealership as the dealer for [[John Deere Tractors]] in Venezuela.  It also became the largest [[automobile]] dealership in South America, according to the Ford Motors Company (USA).  A significant contributor to the success of the Aco Group was the innovative introduction in Venezuela of in-house auto sale financing using a captive finance company.&lt;ref name="Coronil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liivrand"/&gt; In 1983, the Aco Group was ranked fifth largest private-sector company in Venezuela [El Universal].  A progressive downturn in Venezuela's economy which had particular adverse on Aco's capital intensive businesses, resulted in a reorganization in 1994 under new leadership. Mannil was voted out as CEO so he left ACO and formed Oriand, with a portion of auto dealerships that had been part of Aco.&lt;ref name="Liivrand"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tattar"/&gt; At that time he had been the fourth largest shareholder, owning 20% of the company.&lt;ref name="Liivrand"/&gt; Männil continued to own Oriand [[Grupo Oriand]], until his death.

Männil was member of [[AEI World Forum]],&lt;ref name="nacion"/&gt; founded by president [[Gerald Ford]] whom Männil personally knew.&lt;ref name="ekspress"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="slol-2000"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ohtuleht.ee/index.aspx?id=97704|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130213052820/http://www.ohtuleht.ee/index.aspx?id=97704|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 13, 2013|title=Peeter Ernits surub rikkaima eestlase kaante vahele|last=Michelson|first=Tarmo|date=October 18, 2000|newspaper=SL Õhtuleht|language=Estonian|accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Männil visited Estonia for the first time since 1943 at the invitation of [[Vaino Väljas]], who he had met when Väljas was the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] ambassador to Venezuela. At the time of the [[Singing Revolution|restoration of Estonian independence]] (1990–1992), during the governments of [[Edgar Savisaar]] and [[Tiit Vähi]],&lt;ref name=savisaar&gt;{{cite book |last= Savisaar |first= Edgar |title=Peaminister.

The club consisted of Estonian businessmen living abroad who gave economic advice and helped to explain Estonia's situation to Western nations. Männil was a godfather of Savisaar's daughter.&lt;ref name="savisaar"/&gt;

Near the end of 2002, Männil was forced to temporarily relocate to [[Costa Rica]] due to the [[Venezuelan general strike of 2002–2003|Venezuelan general strike]].&lt;ref name="kuulikindlaid"&gt;{{cite news|last=Luik|first=Selle|title=Männil toodab kuulikindlaid autosid|url=http://paber.ekspress.ee/viewdoc/08418D3371924A79C2256CAE005DC831|accessdate=30 August 2010|newspaper=Eesti Ekspress|date=January 15, 2003|language=Estonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Männil's sons succeeded him when he retired from active business dealings in 2003.&lt;ref name="arileht"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arileht.ee/artikkel/330365|title=Lapsed valitsevad Harry Männili impeeriumi|date=2004-10-27|newspaper=Eesti Päevaleht|language=Estonian|accessdate=2009-10-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720125059/http://www.arileht.ee/artikkel/330365|archivedate=2011-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Männil died on January 11, 2010, in [[San José, Costa Rica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/486158|title=Suri väliseestlasest suurärimees Harry Männil|last=Masing|first=Kadri|newspaper=Eesti Päevaleht|language=Estonian|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ashes were placed in a chapel on his ranch located in the mountains of Costa Rica.&lt;ref name="AP-death"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ap3.ee/?PublicationId=3A7AB331-5884-4889-AC1D-80AFB1E7FBCE|title=Suri Harry Männil|last=Kald|first=Indrek|date=January 12, 2010|newspaper=Äripäev|language=Estonian|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art collecting and work as a cultural benefactor==
Männil was known as an [[art collector]] and cultural benefactor in several countries. His interest in art collecting first arose when he came into the possession of some works by [[Eduard Wiiralt]] during World War II.&lt;ref name="top200"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://paber.ekspress.ee/arhiiv/Vanad/1997/35/maailm.html|title=Harry Männil maailma kunstikogujate eliidis|last=Liivrand|first=Harry|newspaper=Eesti Ekspress|language=Estonian|year=1997|issue=35|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Männil started collecting [[pre-Columbian art]] in 1957,&lt;ref name="top200"/&gt;  and eventually owned the largest private collection in Venezuela.&lt;ref name="Coronil"/&gt; His collection was regarded as among the 200 most important private collections by ''[[ARTnews]]'' magazine in 1997.&lt;ref name="top200"/&gt; Männil classified his art collection into three main groups: pre-Columbian art, modern [[Latin American art]], and art of the [[South American Indigenous people]]. He also possessed a few items of 17th–18th century colonial art.&lt;ref name="kuulikindlaid"/&gt; Männil, together with his wife, promoted the commercial production and marketing of the textile works of the [[Guajiro]] Indians. These two interests led to conflicts with local [[anthropologists]], who criticized their relationship with the Guajiro people and their means of building their archaeological collection.&lt;ref name="Coronil"/&gt;

On July 22, 2010, after Harry Männil's death, Costa Rican authorities raided his house in [[Heredia, Costa Rica|Heredia]] and seized 108 pieces of pre-Columbian art, including fourteen large [[stone spheres of Costa Rica|stone spheres]]. The family had been given two deadlines to hand over the objects voluntarily, and since that did not happen, a raid was conducted. Officials stated that the pieces had been obtained through an illegal purchase which had broken a law against trafficking in archaeological artifacts. The objects were taken to the [[Museo Nacional de Costa Rica]] in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Solano B.|first=Andrea|title=Fiscalía de Heredia hizo el mayor decomiso de piezas arqueológicas|url=http://www.nacion.com/2010-07-24/AldeaGlobal/NotaPrincipal/AldeaGlobal2459037.aspx|accessdate=30 August 2010|newspaper=La Nación|date=July 23, 2010|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry Männil was the founder and first director of the West Venezuela Water Sport Federation, and had been the director of [[Caracas Athenaeum]] in [[Caracas]] and the Maracaibo Art Center. He was a member of the International Council of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York.&lt;ref name="kaevats"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2008/2009 Annual Listing|url=http://www.moma.org/docs/give/annuallisting.pdf|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=30 August 2010|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Männil, together with [[Henry Radeval]], contributed to the establishment of the [[Estonian National Library]]'s Eduard Wiiralt gallery and founded the Eduard Wiiralt Art Award in 1998.&lt;ref name="11-kultuuritegelast"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eesti nüüdisgraafika näitus – Eduard Wiiralti kunstiauhind 2011|url=http://www.nlib.ee/wiiralt|publisher=[[National Library of Estonia]]|accessdate=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eesti nüüdisgraafika näitus – Eduard Wiiralti kunstiauhind 2011: Reglement|url=http://www.nlib.ee/eduard-wiiralti-kunstiauhind-reglement/|publisher=[[National Library of Estonia]]|accessdate=8 October 2010|date=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estonian writer Olev Remsu has published a biography of Harry Männil titled ''Elitaarne mees''  (Tänapäev 2011).

==Honors==
From 1968 until his death Männil was a [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Knight of Malta]].&lt;ref name="kaevats"/&gt; He was an [[honorary citizen]] of the city of [[Thibodaux, Louisiana|Thibodaux]], [[Louisiana]]. The Venezuelan government awarded him the [[Order of the Star of Carabobo]] and the [[Order of Francisco de Miranda]]. He received the [[Order of the Polar Star]] from the King of Sweden.&lt;ref name="11-kultuuritegelast"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.postimees.ee/?id=210947|title=11 kultuuritegelast ja poliitikut meenutavad Harry Männilit|date=January 12, 2010|newspaper=Postimees|language=Estonian|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Harry Männil was a brother of [[geologist]] [[Ralf Männil]]. He married Masula D'Empaire, a granddaughter of commercial tycoon and banker Samuel Belloso,&lt;ref name="Coronil"/&gt; in 1955; they had four children.&lt;ref name="ekspress"/&gt; The Belloso are a prominent family of recent Jewish heritage dating back as commercial traders and bankers in Curacao. Many of the family members converted to become Catholics while others retained their Jewish faith to the present.

Männil's primary country of residence was Venezuela, where he lived in [[Caracas]], but he also owned a ranch in Costa Rica, a farm in [[Los Llanos (South America)|Llanos]], Venezuela, and apartments in Paris and New York.&lt;ref name="slol-2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maaleht2010-01-14"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://paber.maaleht.ee/?grupp=artikkel&amp;artikkel=16445|title=Pikk tööpäev sai lõplikult otsa|last=Ernits|first=Peeter|date=January 14, 2010|newspaper=Maaleht|language=Estonian|accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roses - Vincent van Gogh.JPG|thumb|right|100000x260px|''[[Still Life: Vase with Pink Roses]]'' is an oil painting on canvas completed by [[Vincent van Gogh]] in 1890, which makes extensive use of the ''impasto'' technique.]]

'''Impasto''' is a technique used in [[painting]], where [[paint]] is laid on an area of the surface in very thick layers,&lt;ref&gt;''Impasto.'' In: {{cite book |date=2015 |editor1-last= Weyer |editor1-first=Angela |editor2-last=Roig Picazo |editor2-first=Pilar |editor3-last=Pop |editor3-first=Daniel |editor4-last=Cassar |editor4-first=JoAnn |editor5-last=Özköse |editor5-first= Aysun |editor6-last=Vallet |editor6-first=Jean-Marc |editor7-last=Srša |editor7-first= Ivan |title=EwaGlos.

English Definitions with translations into Bulgarian, Croatian, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Romanian, Spanish and Turkish. |url= http://elearn.hawk-hhg.de/projekte/ewaglos/pages/download.php |location=Petersberg |publisher=Michael Imhof |page=100 |doi=10.5165/hawk-hhg/233}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually thick enough that the [[brush]] or [[painting-knife]] strokes are visible. Paint can also be mixed right on the canvas. When dry, impasto provides texture; the paint appears to be coming ''out'' of the canvas.

== Origins ==
The word ''impasto'' is Italian in origin; in which it means "dough" or "mixture"; the verb "impastare" translates to "to knead", or "to paste". Italian usage of "impasto" includes both a painting and a [[impasto (pottery)|potting technique]]. According to Webster's ''New World College Dictionary'', the root noun of ''impasto'' is ''pasta'', whose primary meaning in Italian is ''paste''.

== Mediums ==
[[Oil paint]] is the traditional medium for impasto painting, due to its thick consistency and slow drying time. [[Acrylic paint]] can also be used for impasto by adding heavy body acrylic gels. Impasto is generally not seen done in [[watercolour|watercolor]] or [[tempera]] without the addition of thickening agent due to the inherent thinness of these media. An artist working in [[pastels]] can produce a limited impasto effect by pressing a soft pastel firmly against the paper.

== Purposes ==
The impasto technique serves several purposes. First, it makes the light [[Reflection (physics)|reflect]] in a particular way, giving the artist additional control over the play of light in the painting. Second, it can add expressiveness to the painting, with the viewer being able to notice the strength and speed by which the artist applied the paint. Third, impasto can push a piece from a painting to a three-dimensional sculptural rendering.  The first objective was originally sought by masters such as [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], [[Titian]], and [[Vermeer]], to represent folds in clothes or jewels: it was then juxtaposed with a more delicate painting style. Much later, the French [[Impressionists]] created pieces covering entire canvases with rich impasto textures. [[Vincent van Gogh]] used it frequently for aesthetics and expression. [[Abstract expressionists]] such as [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] also made extensive use of it, motivated in part by a desire to create paintings which dramatically record the action of painting itself. Still more recently, [[Frank Auerbach]] has used such heavy impasto that some of his paintings become nearly three-dimensional.

Impasto gives texture to the painting, meaning it can be opposed to more [[Flatness (art)|flat]], smooth, or blended painting styles.

== Artists ==
Many artists have used the impasto technique. Some of the more notable ones including: [[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]], [[Diego Velázquez]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Willem de Kooning]].&lt;center&gt;

The '''implied author''' is a concept of [[literary criticism]] developed in the 20th century. Distinct from the [[author]] and the [[narrator]], the term refers to the "authorial character" that a reader infers from a text based on the way a literary work is written.   In other words, the implied author is a construct, the image of the writer produced by a reader as called forth from the text.  The implied author may or may not coincide with the author's expressed intentions or known personality traits. 

In particular, all aspects of the text can be attributed to the design of the implied author--everything can be read as having meaning--even if the real author was simply "nodding" or a textual element was "unintentional." A story's apparent theme or implications (as evidenced within the text) can be attributed to the implied author even if disavowed by the flesh and blood author (FBA).

For example, while "real" author J.K. Rowling has expressed solidarity with the LGBT community, the implied author of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them has been said to convey no such solidarity, since "the only person that Rowling has ever written as definitively queer in her text is portrayed as pedophilic and manipulative and also a fascist" (Taylor Follett.  "Fantastic Beasts: Amazing Writing and Terrible Representation" Daily Californian, Nov. 28th, 2016).

Author [[Saul Bellow]] once observed that it was not surprising, with all the revision that goes into a work, that an author might appear better on the page than in real life.{{Attribution needed|date=May 2011}}

==History==
Following the [[hermeneutics]] tradition of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Thomas Carlyle]] and [[Benedetto Croce]],  [[Intentionalist]]s [[P. D. Juhl]] and [[E. D. Hirsch Jr.]] insist that the correct interpretation of a text reflects the [[intention]] of the real author exactly. However, under the influence of [[structuralism]], [[Roland Barthes]] declared "the death of the (real) author", saying the text speaks for itself in reading. Anti-intentionalists, such as [[Monroe Beardsley]] and [[Roger Fowler]], also thought that interpretation should be brought out only from the text.  They held that readers should not confuse the meaning of the text with the author's intention, pointing out that one can understand the meaning of a text without knowing anything whatsoever about the author.

In his 1961 book ''The Rhetoric of Fiction'', [[Wayne C. Booth]] introduced the term ''implied author'' to distinguish the virtual author of the text from the real author.  In addition, he proposed another concept, the ''career-author'': a composite of the implied authors of all of a given author's works.&lt;ref name="booth-rhetoric-431"/&gt;

[[Gérard Genette]] used the term ''[[focalization]]'' to distinguish the point of view of a work ("who sees?") from the focal position of a work ("who perceives?")  In his 1972 book ''Narrative Discourse'', he took issue with Booth's classifications (among others), suggesting three terms to organize works by focal position:&lt;ref name="genette-revisit-64"/&gt;
; ''zero focalization''
: The implied author is omniscient, seeing and knowing all; "vision from behind".
; ''internal focalization''
: The implied author is a character in the story, speaking in a [[monologue]] with his impressions; "narrative with point of view, reflector, selective omniscience, restriction of field" or "vision with".
; ''external focalization''
: The implied author talks objectively, speaking only of the external behavior of the characters in the story; "vision from without".
[[Mieke Bal]] argued that Genette's focalizations did not describe the implied author, but only the narrator of the story.

[[Seymour Chatman]], in his book ''Coming to Terms'', posits that the act of reading is "ultimately an exchange between real human beings [that] entails two intermediate constructs: one in the text, which invents it upon each reading (the implied author), and one outside the text, which construes it upon each reading (the implied reader)."  Because the reader cannot engage in dialogue with the implied author to clarify the meaning or emphasis of a text, Chatman says, the concept of the implied author prevents the reader from assuming that the text represents direct access to the real author or the fictional speaker.&lt;ref name="chatman-terms-76"/&gt; Chatman also argues for the relevance of the implied author as a concept in film studies, a position that [[David Bordwell]] disputes.

[[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] also considered the text as a [[conversation]] with the reader.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4933">'''Integrated design''' is an approach to [[design]] which brings together specialisms usually considered separately.  For example:
*Design of a building which considers [[architecture]], [[structural engineering]], [[passive solar building design]] &lt;ref name="Shahabian"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Aryan |last=Shahabian |title=Integration of Solar-Climatic Vision and Structural Design in Architecture of Tall Buildings |format=PDF |conference=International Conference CISBAT 2015 Future Buildings and Districts - Sustainability from Nano to Urban Scale| pages=179–184 |date=9-11 September 2015 |location=Lausanne |publisher=Lausanne, LESO-PB, EPFL | url=https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/213316/files/2_SHAHABIAN.pdf |access-date=8 July 2018 |archive-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281906226_Integration_of_solar-climatic_vision_and_structural_design_in_architecture_of_tall_buildings |archive-date=September 2015 |doi=10.5075/epfl-cisbat2015-179-184}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[HVAC]].  The approach may also integrate [[building lifecycle management]] and a greater consideration of the end users of the building.  The aim of integrated building design is often to produce [[sustainable architecture]].&lt;ref name="Moe"&gt;{{cite book |last=Moe |first=Kiel |date=2008 |title=Integrated Design in Contemporary Architecture |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RzuEiv4Rvu4C |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |isbn=1568987455}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Design of both a product (or family of products) and the assembly system that will produce it.&lt;ref name="DeLitDelchambre"&gt;{{cite book |last1=De Lit |first1=Pierre |last2=Delchambre |first2=Alain |date=2011 |title=Integrated Design of a Product Family and Its Assembly System |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rZzzBwAAQBAJ |publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |isbn=1461504171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chedmail"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Chedmail |editor-first=Patrick |date=2013 |title=Integrated Design and Manufacturing in Mechanical Engineering: Proceedings of the Third IDMME Conference Held in Montreal, Canada, May 2000 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=833oCAAAQBAJ |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=9401599661|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Design of an electronic product that considers both hardware and software aspects, although this is often called co-design (not to be confused with [[participatory design]], which is also often called co-design).

The requirement for integrated design comes when the different specialisms are dependent on each other or "coupled". An alternative or complimentary approach to integrated design is to consciously reduce the dependencies. In  computing and systems design, this approach is known as [[loose coupling]].

==Dis-integrated design==
Three phenomena are associated with a lack of integrated design:&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite conference | url = http://shura.shu.ac.uk/544/1/fulltext.pdf | title = Design Dis-integration Silent, Partial, and Disparate Design | last1 = Stevens | first1 = John, | last2 = Moultrie | first2 = James | last3 = Crilly | first3 = Nathan | date = 2009 | publisher =  Sheffield Hallam University | book-title = In: Undisciplined! Design Research Society Conference 2008 | id = http://shura.shu.ac.uk/544}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Silent design: design by default, by omission or by people not aware that they are participating in design activity.
*Partial design: design is only used to a limited degree, such as in superficial styling, often after the important design decisions have been made.
*Disparate design: design activity may be widespread, but is not co-ordinated or brought together to realise its potential.

A committee is sometimes a deliberate attempt to address disparate design, but [[design by committee]] is associated with silent design.

==Methods for integrated design==

The integrated design approach incorporates methods and tools to encourage and enable the specialists in the different areas to work together to produce an integrated design.&lt;ref name="TichkiewitchBrissaud"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1= Tichkiewitch |editor-first1=Serge |editor-last2= Brissaud |editor-first2=Daniel |date=2013 |title=Methods and Tools for Co-operative and Integrated Design| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=di34CAAAQBAJ |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=9401722560}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such method is a [[charrette]] with all specialists present, early in the design process.&lt;ref name="ToddLindsey"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Todd |first1=Joel Ann |last2=Lindsey |first2=Gail |date=2013 |title=Planning and Conducting Integrated Design (ID) Charrettes |url=https://www.wbdg.org/resources/charrettes.php |work=Whole Building Design Guide |publisher=[[National Institute of Building Sciences]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isuma''' ([[Inuktitut syllabics]], '''ᐃᓱᒪ'''; [[Inuktituk]] for "to think") is [[Canada]]'s first [[Inuit]] (75%) [[production company]] co-founded by [[Zacharias Kunuk]], [[Paul Apak Angilirq]] and [[Norman Cohn (film producer)|Norman Cohn]] in [[Igloolik]], [[Nunavut]] in 1990. The company focuses on bringing people of multiple age ranges, cultural backgrounds, and belief systems together to support and promote [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canada's indigenous community]] through television, the Internet and films. Isuma's mission is to produce independent community-based media aimed to preserve and enhance [[Inuit culture]] and language; to create jobs and economic development in Igloolik and Nunavut; and to tell authentic Inuit stories to Inuit and non-Inuit audiences worldwide. Isuma is related to [[Arnait Video Productions]].

In 2011, Isuma filed for [[receivership]], citing $750,000 in debts, including $500,000 to Atuqtuarvik Corp. of [[Rankin Inlet]]. A Montreal-based receiver, [[RSM Richter]], is putting company’s assets—most notably its film library—up for sale.&lt;ref name=Dixon&gt;{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Guy|title=Out in the cold: the struggle of Inuit film|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/movies/out-in-the-cold-the-struggle-of-inuit-film/article2287215/|accessdate=2 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=year-end&gt;{{cite news|title=Nunavut: a timeline for the year that was|url=http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/65674nunavut_a_timeline_for_the_year_that_was/|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=[[Nunatsiaq News]]|date=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1999, the company filmed and produced the supernatural historical thriller ''[[Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner]]'',.  It was a box office success around the world, and won the [[Caméra d'Or]] for Best First Feature Film at the 2001 [[Cannes Film Festival]], six [[Genie Award]]s (including Best Picture), and several other international film awards. The film had its Canadian premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in 2001.

The massive critical success of ''Atanarjuat'' led to funding from [[Telefilm Canada]], enabling Isuma to begin development on multiple scripts. One of these, ''[[The Journals of Knud Rasmussen]]'', about the switch from [[shamanism]] to [[Christianity]] in Igloolik in the early 1920s, received the offer to open the Toronto International Film Festival in 2006.

Since Isuma means "to have a thought", the collaborators of Igloolik Isuma Productions encourage alternative and multimedia processes designed to make the world at large think not only about the Inuit and their current plight, but about indigenous peoples in general, and the future of the role of community in society. Much of the [[New World]]’s wealth today was extracted from its Aboriginal citizens, who by every measure now are the most destitute populations in these countries. If the Inuit of ''Fast Runner'' ended up in 1922 in church, the Inuit of ''The Journals'' ended up in today’s newspapers stories, living in [[Third World]] ghettos scattered across the wealthiest [[First World]] nations.

Historically, how a country treats its indigenous people is an excellent gauge of its social and political views on humanism in general; what happens to the indigenous peoples of any given country is a sign of what will eventually happen to the dominant culture in time. Even today the law, education, religion and media continue to efface living memories of Aboriginal cultural history. As Norman Cohn says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Save the seals and Save the bears seems more attractive than Save the people, but unless the rights of humans to live in their habitat are more widely recognized and protected it's a little fatuous to even dream about saving birds and animals.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Isuma aims to increase awareness and focus about and for indigenous peoples of all cultures, not just [[Northern Canada]], through encouraging multimedia approaches. Their goal is to ensure that these rights are not compartmentalized, but rather include the awareness of [[human rights]] in a larger cultural and holistic context: through exploration of spirituality, globalization, environmentalism, cinema, world media, and Native awareness.

==IsumaTV==
[[File:Isuma-logo.png|thumb|IsumaTV logo|200px]]
IsumaTV is a video Internet portal. It is a video site dedicated to indigenous filmmakers and is a free service. The site hosts films that put forth an aboriginal view and is intended to help Native communities around the world become connected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isuma.ca/IsumaTV IsumaTV]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kuchi-e''' are [[Book frontispiece|frontispieces]] of books, especially woodblock printed fronticpieces for Japanese romance novels and literary magazines published from the 1890s to the 1910s.&lt;ref&gt;Newland, Amy Reigle. (2005). ''Hotei Encyclopedia of Japanese Woodblock Prints.''  Amsterdam: Hotei, p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;

They usually portrayed women and were bounded into the book's spine or inserted into literary magazines to give readers a sense of what type of stories were to unfold.  Most '''Kuchi-e''' were [[Woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock prints]] in romance novels intended for a female audience.  However, some were [[Lithography|lithographs]], and some were inserted into other types of literature.  Most measured either 22 x 30&amp;nbsp;cm or 14 x 20&amp;nbsp;cm, the former being folded in thirds, and the latter being folded in half.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artelino.com/articles/kuchi-e.asp  Artlino]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the '''kuchi-e''' by [[Mizuno Toshikata]], note the two horizontal fold lines and the margin on top for binding.  Artists who designed '''kuchi-e''' include [[Hirezaki Eiho]], [[Ikeda Shoen]], [[Kaburagi Kiyokata]], [[Kajita Hanko]], [[Mishima Shoso]], [[Mizuno Toshikata]], [[Odake Kokkan]], [[Ogata Gekko]], [[Suzuki Kason]], [[Takeuchi Keishu]], [[Terasaki Kogyo]], [[Tomioka Eisen]], [[Tsutsui Toshimine]], [[Utagawa Kunimatsu]], [[Watanabe Seitei]], and [[Yamada Keichu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oberlin.edu/staff/fzwegat/ Oberlin College website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artelino.com/articles/kuchi-e.asp  Artlino]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translation==
The word "kuchi-e" (口絵) is usually translated into English as mouth (kuchi) picture (e).&lt;ref&gt;Newland, Amy Reigle. (2005). ''Hotei Encyclopedia of Japanese Woodblock Prints.''  Amsterdam: Hotei, p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;  However, "kuchi" (口) may also mean opening, as it does in the compound words iri-guchi 入口 (entrance) and de-guchi 出口 (exit).  In this way, the translation "entrance picture" more clearly communicates the intended function of a kuchi-e as a frontispiece in a literary work.&lt;ref&gt;Personal communication with Stephen Salel, Robert F. Lange Foundation Assistant Curator of Japanese Art, Honolulu Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Letter Carriers' Monument''''' is a piece of [[public art]] by [[Americans|American]] artist [[Elliot Offner]], located on a triangular plot formed by North 2nd Street, North Plankinton Avenue and West Wells Street in downtown [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], in the [[United States]]. Created in 1989, the monument depicts three [[Mail carrier|letter carriers]] and was commissioned in celebration of the centennial of the [[National Association of Letter Carriers]] (NALC).

The [[bronze]] [[sculpture]] depicts three figures representing letter carriers from across NALC's history: A white man with a [[mustache]] wearing a turn of the 20th century uniform (with an inscription on the [[jacket]] reading "Offner '89"); an [[African American]] man wearing a 1939 uniform (from the time of NALC's fiftieth anniversary); and a woman in a contemporary uniform. The sculpture is set on a black [[granite]] [[Pedestal|base]], with the north and south faces of the base reading: "In honor of the men and women/ who have delivered for America/ in rain, sleet, and snow./ And in tribute to their Union,/ the National Association of Letter Carriers,/ founded across Plankinton Avenue/ from this site on August 30, 1889./ Dedicated August 30, 1989." The monument measures 66 x 67 x 56&amp;nbsp;inches, and was created in 1989.&lt;ref name= SIRIS&gt;[http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1VP1H27505088.1326&amp;profile=ariall&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;view=subscriptionsummary&amp;uri=full=3100001~!29661~!59&amp;ri=2&amp;aspect=Browse&amp;menu=search&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;staffonly=&amp;term=Outdoor+Sculpture+--+Wisconsin+--+Milwaukee&amp;index=OBJEC&amp;uindex=&amp;aspect=Browse&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=2], SIRIS.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture is a tribute to the National Association of Letter Carriers, commissioned to celebrate the centennial of its founding. The group's history began when the [[United States Postal Service]] gave employment preference to veterans after the [[American Civil War]]. As a result, there were many veterans employed by the Postal Service across the United States. After the Postal Service administration refused to recognize the [[eight-hour day]], a group of veteran Milwaukee postal workers organized 60 postal worker veterans from 18 states who met in a tavern on Plankinton Avenue (the building, now used for storage by [[Renaissance Books]], formerly housed the headquarters of [[Manpower Inc.]]) on August 30, 1889, immediately following the national encampment of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] in Milwaukee. The postal workers agreed to form the National Association of Letter Carriers, demanding an eight-hour work day, a higher pay scale, a [[pension]] plan, and [[service stripe]]s for every four years of service.&lt;ref name= Buck&gt;Buck, Diane M. and Virginia A. Palmer (1995). ''Outdoor Sculpture in Milwaukee: A Cultural and Historical Guidebook'', p. 42. The State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Madison&lt;/ref&gt;

Elliot Offner was commissioned through the Franz Bader Gallery in [[New York City|New York]] to create the monument. He built the [[maquette]] in [[Cambridge]], [[England]] while he was there as a visiting artist. He then worked with the Tallix Foundry in [[Beacon, New York]] to [[Casting|cast]] the sculpture. The work was sent to Milwaukee by truck from New York.

Centennial celebrations lasted four days and included a parade, exhibits and the dedication of the monument by [[Vincent Sombrotto|Vincent R. Sombrotto]], NALC's president. More than four thousand letter carriers and their families attended the festivities. The U.S. Postal Service issued a postage stamp (designed by [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]]) depicting three contemporary letter carriers, to commemorate the centennial day.

Buck and Palmer's 1995 ''Outdoor Sculpture in Milwaukee: A Cultural and Historical Guidebook'' observes: "The downtown Milwaukee site of the monument is correct in a historical sense, but unsuccessful in its public presence. Site considerations for the monument were overlooked and it stands on the small crowded triangle with annoying awkwardness."&lt;ref name= Buck /&gt;

The sculpture is well maintained.&lt;ref name= SIRIS /&gt;

|An analysis of around 14 succession candidates, in terms of five lineages with royal pretensions (including the [[House of Aviz]]). &lt;ref&gt;Mayer p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; This work put into play the succession, by suggesting that [[elective monarchy]], rather than [[hereditary monarchy]], was a more appropriate way to address the succession issue. That approach was rebutted in most of the subsequent tracts.&lt;ref name="Houl35"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ralph Anthony Houlbrooke|title=James VI and I: Ideas, Authority, and Government|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hBSj8wodKcC&amp;pg=PA35|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-5410-0|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Alexander Dicsone]]
|''Of the Right of the Crowne efter Hir Majesty''&lt;ref&gt;Mayer p. 91, 99-100&lt;/ref&gt;
|Commissioned by James VI, in answer to Doleman, with a related work by [[Walter Quin]]. Quin had made an oration on James's claim in 1596; but his book of 1598 on the same topic was refused by the printer, [[Robert Waldegrave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=22964|title=Quin, Walter|first=J. K.|last= McGinley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Ashfield (Catholic agent)|Edmund Ashfield]] had prompted James to respond to Doleman, stating that the literature in favour of his mother Mary Queen of Scots was now counter-productive. He urged James to make a case attractive to influential [[common lawyer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marie Axton |title=The Queen's Two Bodies |year=1977 |publisher=Royal Historical Society |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dicsone's work dealt with the four major points raised against James's claim: (a) Scottish birth; (b) the provisions of the [[will of Henry VIII]]; (c) the attainder of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] his mother; (d) his cadet status in the [[House of Lancaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayer p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

|Watson claimed to have written a treatise circulated to the Privy Council, the queen and the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], against the [[Jesuit]] line on a Spanish succession in Doleman. It favoured the [[House of York]], the claim through the House of Aviz being Lancastrian.

'''Museumpark''' is an [[urban park]] in [[Rotterdam]], [[Netherlands]], located between the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]], [[Westersingel]], [[Westzeedijk]] and the complex of the [[Erasmus MC]], a medical centre affiliated with the [[Erasmus University]].

The park lies on the former land of the Hoboken family, who lived in the building that is now the [[Natuurhistorisch Museum Rotterdam]]. The park was laid out in 1927 to the design of the architect Witteveen. On the south side of the pond in the park a monument for Gerrit Jongh, director of municipal works in Rotterdam. There are several [[work of art|artwork]]s in the park, so it also serves as a [[sculpture garden]].

There are a number of museums located in the vicinity of the park, hence the name:

* The [[Netherlands Architecture Institute]] (NAi)
* [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]]
* The [[Chabot Museum]]
* The [[Kunsthal]]
* [[Villa Sonneveld]]
* [[Natuurhistorisch Museum Rotterdam]]

The '''Occupy movement''' was an international [[Progressivism#Contemporary_mainstream_political_conception|progressive]], [[social movement | socio-political movement]] against [[social equality|social]] and [[economic inequality]] and the lack of "real [[democracy]]" around the world. It aimed primarily to advance social and economic justice and new forms of democracy. The movement had many different scopes; local groups often had different focuses, but among the movement's prime concerns were how [[Corporatocracy|large corporations]] (and the [[global financial system]]) control the world in a way that disproportionately benefited a minority, undermined democracy, and was unstable.{{refn|&lt;ref name="the99declaration"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unitethe99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="businessweek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lessighp"/&gt;}} "Occupy" formed part of what [[Manfred Steger]] called the "global justice movement".&lt;ref&gt;

The first Occupy protest to receive widespread attention, [[Occupy Wall Street]] in New York City's [[Zuccotti Park]], began on 17 September 2011. By 9 October, Occupy protests had taken place or were ongoing in [[List of Occupy movement protest locations |over 951 cities across 82 countries, and in over 600 communities in the United States]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Occupy Wall Street protests go global"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Occupy Wall Street protests continue worldwide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian2"/&gt; Although most active in the United States, by October 2012 there had been Occupy protests and occupations in dozens of other countries across every inhabited continent. For the first month, overt police repression remained minimal, but this began to change by 25 October 2011 when police first attempted to forcibly remove [[Occupy Oakland]]. By the end of 2011, authorities had cleared most of the major camps, with the last remaining high-profile sites – in [[Washington, D.C.]] and in London – evicted by February 2012.{{refn|&lt;ref name="globalCrackdown"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cityBycity"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Authorities clear"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smash"/&gt;}}

The Occupy movement took inspiration in part from the [[Arab Spring]],&lt;ref name="Where now for the Occupy protesters?"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tahrir Square protesters send message of solidarity to Occupy Wall Street"/&gt; from the [[2009 Iranian presidential election protests|2009 Iranian Green Movement]], and from the Spanish Indignados Movement, as well as from the overall global wave of [[anti-austerity protests]]. The movement commonly uses the slogan "[[We are the 99%]]" and the #Occupy [[hashtag]] format; it organizes through websites such as Occupy Together.&lt;ref&gt;

 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="From a single hashtag, a protest circled the world"/&gt; According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the movement, which [[Cornel West]] described as a "democratic awakening", is difficult to distill to a few demands.&lt;ref name="westc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost22"/&gt; On 12 October 2011, [[Los Angeles City Council]] became one of the first governmental bodies in the United States to adopt a resolution stating its informal support of the Occupy movement.&lt;ref name="City Council Unanimously Passes Occupy L.A. Resolution - Protesters Struggle to Distance Themselves From Democrats, Unions - Los Angeles News - The Informer"/&gt; In October 2012, the Executive Director of Financial Stability at the [[Bank of England]] stated that the protesters were right to criticise and had persuaded bankers and politicians "to behave in a more moral way".&lt;ref name="Andy"/&gt;

==Background==
In 2009 and 2010, students across the University of California [[2009 California college tuition hike protests|occupied campus buildings in protest]] against budget cuts, tuition hikes, and staff cutbacks that had resulted from the Great Recession of 2008. According to [[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent Magazine]], "It was in the context of the California student movement that the slogan 'Occupy Everything, Demand Nothing' first emerged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/from-master-plan-to-no-plan-the-slow-death-of-public-higher-education|title=From Master Plan to No Plan: The Slow Death of Public Higher Education|work=dissentmagazine.org|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Huffington Post'' noted that "During one incident in March of 2010, 150 protesters were arrested for trying to occupy part of Interstate 80 in protest of the budget cuts and tuition hikes, displaying a banner that read 'Occupy everything,' while shutting down the roadway for an hour, and were crushed by the same kind of overwhelming police force that was later mobilized against Occupy encampments across the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/10/thousands-gather-for-occupy-cal-protest_n_1086963.html|title=Occupy Cal Berkeley Protest Draws Thousands, As Two Years Of Occupation Come Home|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Adbusters]]'' editor [[Micah White]], who designed the original [[Occupy Wall Street]] concept, traveled to California for the protests and took part in the occupation of [[Wheeler Hall]].  He wrote enthusiastically for ''Adbusters'' about the "revolutionary potential of [the students] struggle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adbusters.org/blogs/blackspot-blog/open-letter-students.html|title=An Open Letter to Students|work=adbusters.org|accessdate=19 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006073640/https://www.adbusters.org/blogs/blackspot-blog/open-letter-students.html|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2011 Spanish protests|Spanish Indignados movement]] began in mid-May 2011, with camps at [[Madrid]] and elsewhere. According to sociologist [[Manuel Castells]], by the end of the month there were already hundreds of camps around Spain and across the world.&lt;ref name="Castells"/&gt; For some journalists and commentators the camping in Spain marked the start of the global occupy movement, though it is much more commonly said to have begun in New York during September.&lt;ref name="Long"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JesseJ"/&gt;
On 30 May 2011, a leader of the ''Indignados'', inspired by the [[Arab Spring]], [[Gwangju Democratization Movement|5.18 Movement]] of 1980, and [[June Democracy Movement]] of 1987&lt;ref name="Frayer19052011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="From Europe to the US, protesters are inspired by Arab spring"/&gt; called for [[15 October 2011 global protests|a worldwide protest on 15 October]].&lt;ref name="Democracia Real Ya prepara una convocatoria mundial para el 15 de octubre"/&gt; In mid-2011, the Canadian-based group [[Adbusters Media Foundation]], best known for its advertisement-free [[Anti-consumerism|anti-consumerist]] magazine ''[[Adbusters]]'', proposed a peaceful occupation of [[Wall Street]] to protest [[Regulatory capture|corporate influence]] on democracy, address a growing disparity in wealth, and the absence of legal repercussions behind the recent [[global financial crisis]].&lt;ref name="Fleming"/&gt; Adbusters co-founder [[Kalle Lasn]] registered the ''OccupyWallStreet.org'' web address on 9 June.&lt;ref name="preoccupied"/&gt; According to [[Micah White]], the senior editor of the magazine, "[we] basically floated the idea in mid-July into our [email list] and it was spontaneously taken up by all the people of the world, it just kind of snowballed from there."&lt;ref name="Fleming"/&gt;

One of the inspirations for the movement was the [[Democracy Village]] set up in 2010, outside the [[British Parliament]] in [[London]]. The protest received additional attention when the internet hacker group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] encouraged its followers to take part in the protests, calling protesters to "flood lower Manhattan, set up tents, kitchens, peaceful barricades and Occupy Wall Street".&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anonmessage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adbusters3"/&gt; They promoted the protest with a poster featuring a dancer atop Wall Street's iconic [[Charging Bull]].&lt;ref name="inline.poster"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nation.FAQ"/&gt; The first protest was held at [[Zuccotti Park]] in New York City on 17 September 2011,&lt;ref name="twsC65"/&gt; the tenth anniversary of the re-opening of Wall Street trading after the 11 September 2001 attacks. The protests were preceded by a similar [[Occupy Dataran]] movement in [[Kuala Lumpur]] in July, seven weeks before Occupy Wall Street.&lt;ref name="New democratic occupation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Great Occupation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="occupydataran-chronology"/&gt;

==="We are the 99%" slogan===
{{Main|We are the 99%}}
[[File:Occupy protesters, Bennington, VT.jpg|thumb|Occupy protesters with "We are the 99%" signs in [[Bennington, Vermont]]|alt=A group of seven people holding hand-lettered cardboard signs along a city street. The largest says "We are the 99%".]]

The phrase "The 99%" is a [[political slogan]] used by participants in the Occupy movement.&lt;ref name="dcourier"/&gt; It was originally launched as a [[Tumblr]] blog page in late August 2011.&lt;ref name="motherjonesfoundation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy"/&gt; It refers to the concentration of wealth among the top 1% of income earners compared to the other 99 percent;&lt;ref name="cbsprotestsspread"/&gt; the top 1 percent of income earners nearly tripled after-tax income over the last thirty years according to a [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) report.&lt;ref name="ref name"/&gt;

The report was released just as concerns of the Occupy Wall Street movement were beginning to enter the national political debate.&lt;ref name="WashPostBloomberg"/&gt; According to the CBO, between 1979 and 2007 the incomes of the top 1% of Americans grew by an average of 275%. During the same time period, the 60% of Americans in the middle of the income scale saw their income rise by 40%. Since 1979 the average pre-tax income for the bottom 90% of households has decreased by $900, while that of the top 1% increased by over $700,000, as federal taxation became less [[Progressive tax|progressive]]. From 1992 to 2007 the top 400 income earners in the U.S. saw their income increase 392% and their average tax rate reduced by 37%.&lt;ref name="Stupid"/&gt; In 2009, the average income of the top 1% was $960,000 with a minimum income of $343,927.&lt;ref name="CNNstats"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBPP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="doubled"/&gt;
[[File:We are the 99% t-shirts at Occupy Wall Street.JPG|thumb|Protesters with the "99%" t-shirts at Occupy Wall Street on 17 November 2011 near the [[New York City Hall]].]]

In 2007, the richest 1% of the American population owned 34.6% of the country's total wealth, and the next 19% owned 50.5%. Thus, the top 20% of Americans owned 85% of the country's wealth and the bottom 80% of the population owned 15% —an example of the [[Pareto principle]]. Financial inequality (total net worth minus the value of one's home)&lt;ref name="ucsc"/&gt; was greater than inequality in total wealth, with the top 1% of the population owning 42.7%, the next 19% of Americans owning 50.3%, and the bottom 80% owning 7%.&lt;ref name="ForbesJacobs"/&gt;

However, after the [[Great Recession]] which started in 2007, the share of total wealth owned by the top 1% of the population grew from 34.6% to 37.1%, and that owned by the top 20% of Americans grew from 85% to 87.7%. The Great Recession also caused a drop of 36.1% in median household wealth but a drop of only 11.1% for the top 1%, further widening the gap between the 1% and the 99%.&lt;ref name="ForbesJacobs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="levyinstitute"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ucsc1"/&gt; During the economic expansion between 2002 and 2007, the income of the top 1% grew 10 times faster than the income of the bottom 90%. In this period 66% of total income gains went to the 1%, who in 2007 had a larger share of total income than at any time since 1928.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; This is in stark contrast with surveys of U.S. populations that indicate an "ideal" distribution that is much more equal, and a widespread ignorance of the true [[income inequality]] and [[wealth inequality]].&lt;ref name="psychological"/&gt;

==Goals==
During the early weeks, the movement was frequently criticized by the news media for having no clearly defined goals. Speaking on 7 October 2011, Kalle Lasn of Adbusters said that, in the early stages, the lack of demands was the "mysterious part" that allowed the movement to grow.&lt;ref name="Occupy Wall Street: All day, all week"/&gt; By late October, Adbusters had been trying to "rally it around a single, clear demand" for a [[Robin Hood tax]], with a global march in support of the Robin Hood tax planned for 29 October.&lt;ref name = "Obamasupports" &gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/052226f8-f80c-11e0-a419-00144feab49a.html#axzz1b2gyVWm5|title= Obama extends support for protesters|work= [[Financial Times]]|author= Shannon Bond|date = 16 October 2011|accessdate=21 October 2011}} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RobinHood"/&gt; [[Naomi Wolf]] argued that the impression created by much of the media that the protestors did not have clear demands was false. Wolf argued that they did have clear demands including a desire to end what they saw as the [[Money trail|corrupting effect]] of money on politics.&lt;ref name="The shocking truth about the crackdown on Occupy"/&gt; ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine stated that the claims of [[Kalle Lasn]] and [[Micah M. White]] were specific: tighten banking-industry regulations, ban [[high-frequency trading]], arrest all 'financial fraudsters' responsible for the 2008 crash, and form a Presidential commission to investigate and prosecute corruption in politics.&lt;ref name="preoccupied"/&gt; According to ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'', protesters wanted more and better jobs, more equal distribution of income, bank reform, and a reduction of the influence of corporations on politics.&lt;ref name="lowenstein"/&gt; The movement has also been described as broadly [[Anti-capitalism|anticapitalist]].&lt;ref name="Seize the Ponies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reflections for the US Occupy Movement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="An Occupy Road Trip"/&gt;

Some commentators such as [[David Graeber]] and [[Judith Butler]] criticized the idea that the movement must have clearly defined demands; they argued that issuing demands is counterproductive for the Occupy movement, because doing so would legitimize the very power structures the movement seeks to challenge.&lt;ref name="graeber1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Occupy as Form"/&gt; In late November, the London contingent of the Occupy movement released their first statement on corporations, in which they called for measures to end [[tax evasion]] by wealthy firms. The reason for the delay in articulating a clear demand was given as the time it takes to reach a consensus with the sometimes slow processes of ''[[participatory democracy]]''.&lt;ref name="Occupy London sets out agenda on how it wants to change the economic world"/&gt; In November "Occupy London Stock Exchange", an offshoot of Occupy London, said that they were working on a global collaboration of various occupations that reflected the voices of diverse movements worldwide.&lt;ref name="Help us draft the global statement for the Occupy movement"/&gt; The global movement has been called the reinvention of politics, revolution, and utopia in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name="ics"/&gt;

==Methods==
[[File:Hands signals-Occupy-A4.svg|thumb|Assembly hand signals]]
Activists have used web technologies and social media like [[IRC]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Meetup (website)|Meetup]] to coordinate events.&lt;ref name="cnn7102011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author = MD Conover &amp; C Davis &amp; E Ferrara &amp; K McKelvey &amp; [[Filippo Menczer|F Menczer]] &amp; A Flammini |title = The Geospatial Characteristics of a Social Movement Communication Network |journal = [[PLoS ONE]] |volume = 8 |issue = 3 |year = 2013 |pages = e55957 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0055957 |pmid=23483885 |pmc=3590214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author = MD Conover &amp; E Ferrara &amp; [[Filippo Menczer|F Menczer]] &amp; A Flammini |title = The Digital Evolution of Occupy Wall Street |journal = [[PLoS ONE]] |volume = 8 |issue = 5 |year = 2013 |pages = e64679 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0064679 |pmid=23734215 |pmc=3667169}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indymedia]] helped the movement with communications, saying there had been conference calls on [[Skype]] with participants from up to 80 locations. Interactive [[live streams]] of events by [[independent journalists]] such as [[Tim Pool]] were used to augment [[Mainstream media]] coverage. The progressive provider [[May First/People Link]] offered cost-free memberships for dozens of groups, including groups in Iran and Germany, to host websites, emails, and email lists securely. The movement went further to attempt to promote its causes through multi-media and art, which has been gathered and archived by institutions such as the [[National Museum of American History]] and [[New York Historical Society]]. The aim of much of the art produced was to visually impact the mainstream through imagery to attempt to create solidarity and unity among the "99%".&lt;ref name="groundswellcollective"/&gt;

The Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund released a model community bill of rights, promoting laws that strip corporations of their personhood rights and elevating the rights of citizens, for occupy organizers to adopt locally.&lt;ref name="YesMagazine"/&gt; In December 2011, [[Occupy Homes]] embarked on a movement to assist home owners who had lost or were scheduled to lose their homes due to [[foreclosure]] as a result of what they called the illegal practices used by banks that took advantage of consumers. The group planned to occupy foreclosed homes, disrupt bank auctions, and block evictions.&lt;ref name="Les-2011"/&gt;

===Structure===
[[File:Occupy Wall Street Washington Square Park 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|The General Assembly meeting in [[Washington Square Park]], New York City, on 8 October 2011]]
The movement has been described as having an "overriding commitment" to [[participatory democracy]].&lt;ref name="nytimes-will-extremists-hijack-occupy-wall-street"/&gt; Much of the movement's democratic process occurs in "working groups," where any protester is able to have their say. Important decisions are often made at [[General assembly (Occupy movement)|General assemblies]],&lt;ref name="asamblea"/&gt; which can themselves be informed by the findings of multiple working groups. Decisions are made using the [[consensus]] model of participatory democracy. This often features the use of [[Occupy movement hand signals|hand signals]] to increase participation and operating with discussion facilitators rather than leaders – a system that can be traced in part to the [[Quaker]] movement several centuries ago, to [[Athenian democracy|participatory democracy in ancient Athens]], and to the [[spokescouncil]]s of the 1999 [[anti-globalization movement]].&lt;ref name="From Occupy Wall Street to Occupy Everywhere"/&gt;&lt;ref name="byConcensus"/&gt;

At the assemblies, working group proposals are made to meeting participants, who comment upon them using a process called a ''stack''; a queue of speakers that anyone can join. In New York City, Occupy Wall Street uses what is called a [[progressive stack]], in which people from [[marginalized groups]] are sometimes allowed to speak before people from dominant groups, with [[facilitator]]s, or stack-keepers, urging speakers to "step forward, or step back" based on which group they belong to, meaning that women and minorities get to go to the front of the line, while white males must often wait for a turn to speak.&lt;ref name="byConcensus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Where Are the Women at Occupy Wall Street?"/&gt; The progressive stack concept has been criticized by some outside the movement as "forced equality" and "unfair."&lt;ref name="OWS protesters have strange ideas about fairness"/&gt;

===Nonviolence===

Sharp himself warned that many of the tactics the movement were employing were not effective. In an Al Jazeera interview, he said, "The [Occupy] protesters don't have a clear objective, something they can actually achieve.

In late May 2011, sociologist [[Manuel Castells]] congratulated Spanish occupiers for the fact that not a single violent incident had been reported after 11 days of camping all over Spain.&lt;ref name = "Castells"/&gt; Castells said that nonviolence was of fundamental importance, and was echoed by various other sociologists and social historians including Lester Kurtz, Prof. [[Maurice Isserman]] and Prof. [[Tom Juravich]].&lt;ref name = "Castells"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "violent fringe"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Credibility"/&gt; Juravich and others have, however, said that conflict can be important in attracting attention, with much to be gained if occupiers are seen as victims of the violence, providing occupiers keep their own aggression strictly within limits.&lt;ref name = "violent fringe"/&gt; In the words of one occupier, it can help them gain media coverage if they "make things a little sexy and badass" .  The Direct Action Working Group of Occupy Wall Street endorsed [[diversity of tactics]] from the earliest days of the encampment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/05/occupy-wall-street-direct-action|title=Occupy Wall Street: the direct action committee driving the protest's success|author=Karen McVeigh|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all occupiers have upheld the commitment to nonviolence, with aggressive tactics being used in Spain from as early as 15 June, and with some journalists saying the New York branch of the movement did initially accept protestors who had not signed up to nonviolence.&lt;ref name = "earnest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="militant"/&gt;

=== Social media ===
The beginning of the Occupy Movement was reliant on the usage of social media accounts for the dispersal of information. These accounts were very useful and helped tremendously. The social media accounts eventually became hierarchical and failed their purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/bsi/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=f929568d-a8c7-4e69-a795-7856e708a478@sessionmgr4009&amp;hid=4212&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9YnNpLWxpdmU=#AN=118988689&amp;db=bth|title=Social media teams as digital vanguards: the question of leadership in the ...: Business Source|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|access-date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some {{who|date=July 2017}} believe, in order to have been more successful, the social media accounts should have been more heavily regulated and kept to a standard. In addition, a study was published that followed how Occupy user interests changed in time from 1 June 2011 to 31 August 2012. It showed 40% of users produced Occupy related content during peak activity of the movement. But, it was not sustained over the following year, with the user ratio dropping to less than 5% in the last three months of the study period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conover|first=Michael D.|last2=Ferrara|first2=Emilio|last3=Menczer|first3=Filippo|last4=Flammini|first4=Alessandro|date=2013-05-29|title=The Digital Evolution of Occupy Wall Street |journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=8|issue=5|pages=e64679|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0064679 |pmc=3667169|pmid=23734215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responses to the movement from celebrities were both in-person and online. Some find it controversial that rich celebrities made appearances at the Occupy Wall Street Movement, but [[Kanye West]] justified his appearance as helping give power back to the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/899857024/87160CD9172E49B8PQ/1?accountid=14496|title=Celebs make Occupy Wall Street fashionable|last=|first=|date=|website=search.proquest.com|publisher=|access-date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other celebrities such as [[Yoko Ono]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/yokoono/status/120309562246053889|title=Yoko Ono on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|access-date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Ruffalo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/markruffalo/status/127729339205824512|title=Mark Ruffalo on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|access-date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Moore]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/MMFlint/statuses/130399167674728448|title=Michael Moore on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|access-date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; tweeted and showed their support.

==Chronology of events==
{{See also|Timeline of Occupy Wall Street}}
The [[WikiLeaks]] endorsed news site WikiLeaks Central began promoting the idea of a "US Day of Rage,"&lt;ref name="marsh" /&gt; on 10 March 2011. The Canadian editor in chief [[Heather Marsh]], and the American WikiLeaks Central writer [[Alexa O'Brien]] modeled the concept after the Day of Rages being held at that time in the Middle East and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref name="georgiebc" /&gt; Early promotion by the WikiLeaks Twitter and blog was reported&lt;ref name="Dorling" /&gt; as being instrumental in the group's success.&lt;ref name="Dorling" /&gt; It was renamed Occupy Wall Street after the idea publicized on an email list&lt;ref name="Adbusters sparks Wall Street protest" /&gt; and online blog.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} 13 July 2011, by Vancouver-based non-profit Canadian group [[Adbusters]].&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Occupy Canada rallies spread in economic 'awakening'" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Branding of the Occupy Movement" /&gt; The Occupy Wall Street protests began on 17 September 2011 in downtown Manhattan.&lt;ref name="Occupy SF" /&gt; On 9 October 2011, activists in cities in over 25 countries repeated calls for [[15 October 2011 global protests|a global protest on 15 October]].&lt;ref name="cnn7102011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="15october" /&gt; A list of events for 15 October included 951 cities in 82 countries.&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt; On 15 October events were held in many cities worldwide.&lt;ref name="bangkokpost" /&gt;

===17 September to 14 October 2011===
On 17 September 2011, 1,000 protesters gathered in downtown Manhattan walking up and down Wall Street. About 100 to 200 people stayed overnight in Zucotti Park, two blocks north of Wall Street. By 19 September, seven people had been arrested.&lt;ref name="Wall Street Areas Blocked as Police Arrest Seven in Protest" /&gt;
{{anchor|Anthony Bologna}}
At least 80 arrests were made on 24 September after protesters started marching uptown and forcing the closure of several streets. Most of the 80 arrests were for blocking traffic, though some were also charged with [[disorderly conduct]] and resisting arrest. Police officers also used a technique called [[kettling]] which involves using orange nets to isolate protesters into smaller groups.&lt;ref name="80 Arrested as Financial District Protest Moves North" /&gt; Videos which showed several penned-in female demonstrators being hit with [[pepper spray]] by a police official were widely disseminated, sparking controversy. That police official, later identified as [[Inspector#United States|Deputy Inspector]] Anthony Bologna, was shown in other videos hitting a photographer with a burst of spray.

[[File:Wallst14occupy.jpg|thumb|Protesters rallying near New York police headquarters, with [[St. Andrew's Church (New York City)|St. Andrew's Church]] in the background]]
Public attention to the pepper-sprayings resulted in a spike of news media coverage, a pattern that was to be repeated in the coming weeks following confrontations with police. [[Clyde Haberman]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', said that "If the Occupy Wall Street protesters ever choose to recognize a person who gave their cause its biggest boost, they may want to pay tribute to Anthony Bologna," calling the event "vital" for the still nascent movement.&lt;ref name="observer" /&gt; On 1 October 2011, protesters set out to march across the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]. ''The New York Times'' reported that more than 700 arrests were made. Some said the police had tricked protesters, allowing them onto the bridge, and even escorting them partway across. Jesse A. Myerson, a media coordinator for Occupy Wall Street said, "The cops watched and did nothing, indeed, seemed to guide us onto the roadway." A spokesman for the [[New York Police Department]], Paul Browne, said that protesters were given multiple warnings to stay on the sidewalk and not block the street, and were arrested when they refused.&lt;ref name="700arrest" /&gt;

On 4 October, a group of protesters who were arrested on the bridge filed a lawsuit against the city, alleging that officers had violated their constitutional rights by luring them into a trap and then arresting them.&lt;ref name="NYT Bridge Lawsuit" /&gt; In June 2012, a federal judge ruled that the protesters had not received sufficient warning of arrest pending entrance onto the Brooklyn Bridge. Although video evidence showed the police warning protesters by bullhorn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shareable.net/blog/the-battle-of-brooklyn-bridge|title=The Battle of Brooklyn Bridge|work=Shareable|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; after reviewing it, Judge Jed S. Rakoff sided with plaintiffs, saying, "a reasonable officer in the noisy environment defendants occupied would have known that a single bull horn could not reasonably communicate a message to 700 demonstrators".&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

On 5 October 2011, joined by union members, students, and the unemployed, the demonstration swelled to the largest yet with an estimated 15,000 marchers joining the protest. Smaller protests continued in cities and on college campuses across the country. Thousands of union workers joined protesters marching through the Financial District. The march was mostly peaceful—until after nightfall, when scuffles erupted. About 200 protesters tried to storm barricades blocking them from Wall Street and the Stock Exchange. Police responded with pepper spray and penned the protesters in with orange netting. Inspired by Occupy Wall Street, British protesters organized an [[OccupyLSX|occupation of the London Stock Exchange]] to bring attention to what they saw as unethical behavior on the part of banks. One of the organizers of the protest said the protests were to be focused against "increasing social and economic injustice in this country." In his opinion, "the Government has made sure to maintain the status quo and let the people who caused this crisis get off scot-free, whilst conversely ensuring that the people of this country pay the price, in particular those most vulnerable."&lt;ref name="guardian protests london" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sydney morning herald protests london" /&gt;&lt;ref name="metro attracts facebook" /&gt;

===15 October to 4 November===
[[File:Occupy Ljubljana crowd 1.jpg|thumb|A crowd of protestors in [[Congress Square]], Ljubljana, Slovenia, on 15 October 2011]]
On [[15 October 2011 global protests]] were staged around the world, with thousands of protesters staging demonstrations in 900 cities including Auckland, Sydney, Hong Kong, Taipei, Tokyo, São Paulo, Paris, Madrid, Berlin, Hamburg, Leipzig, and many other cities. In Frankfurt, 5,000 people protested at the European Central Bank and in Zurich, Switzerland's financial hub, protesters carried banners reading "We won't bail you out yet again" and "We are the 99 percent." Protests were largely peaceful; however, a protest in Rome that drew thousands turned violent.&lt;ref name="cbsnews" /&gt; Thousands of Occupy Wall Street protesters gathered in [[Times Square]] in New York City and rallied for several hours.&lt;ref name="ChicagoSun-Times-WallStreet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbsnews2" /&gt; Several hundred protesters were arrested across the U.S., mostly for refusing to obey police orders to leave public areas. In Chicago there were 175 arrests, about 100 arrests in Arizona (53 in [[Tucson]], 46 in Phoenix), and more than 70 in New York City, including at least 40 in Times Square.&lt;ref name="Hundreds arrested in 'Occupy' protests" /&gt; Multiple arrests were reported in Chicago, and about 150 people camped out by city hall in Minneapolis.&lt;ref name="Occupy Wall Street: How long can it last?" /&gt;

In the early morning hours of 25 October, police cleared and closed an Occupy Oakland encampment in [[Frank Ogawa Plaza]] in Oakland, California.&lt;ref name="Police clear Occupy Oakland camps, arrest dozens" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jesse" /&gt; The raid was chaotic and violent, but Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan expressed his pleasure concerning the operation because neither the police nor the public suffered any injuries.&lt;ref name="Occupy Oakland Gets Shut Down" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bender1" /&gt; A street march that afternoon protesting the closure culminated in a confrontation between police and protesters, who sought to re-establish the Ogawa Plaza encampment. During this confrontation, protester Scott Olsen, a former Marine and Iraq War veteran, suffered a skull fracture caused by a tear-gas projectile or smoke canister fired by police.&lt;ref name="bender1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott Olsen injuries prompt review as Occupy Oakland protests continue" /&gt; By 29 October 2011, there were around 2,300 Occupy protest camps across around 2,000 cities worldwide.&lt;ref name="'Occupy Auckland' protest speaks with many voices" /&gt; On 2 November, protesters in [[Oakland, California]], shut down the [[Port of Oakland]], the fifth busiest port in the nation. Police estimated that about 3,000 demonstrators were gathered at the port and 4,500 had marched across the city; however, a member of the Occupy movement was quoted by the BBC as estimating as many as 30,000 may have taken part.&lt;ref name="bbc-15568057" /&gt;

On 4 November 2011, "Occupy the Roads" (OTR) started traveling throughout the U.S. to bring the message of Occupy, in order to educate the people on various issues facing the general public and shine a light on the inequities and political injustice. OTR has been to every major Occupy Event in support of all occupied cities, traveling over 31,000 miles and visiting 42 States and 160 cities since inception. One side of the RV (named the "V"- from the chant "Whose V? RV") has been decorated with stickers, posters, and event notices from around the Country representing a billboard for the Occupy movement. On the other side is 31&amp;nbsp;ft of graphics in support for Bradley/Chelsey Manning and WikiLeaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===5 to 25 November===
On 5 November, protesters held "Bank Transfer Day", marching on banks and other financial institutions to urge Americans to move their money from big corporate banks to smaller community credit unions. It was reported that an estimated 600,000 people took their money out of major banks.&lt;ref name="theweek" /&gt; On 11 November, [[Remembrance Day]] in Canada, police forcibly removed tents from Victoria Park in Halifax, Nova Scotia and arrested 15 protestors.&lt;ref name="Arrests as Halifax Cops Evict Occupy protesters" /&gt; On the night of 14 November, a coordinated crackdown was undertaken by authorities around the world, with several camps being forcibly cleared including Zuccotti Park in New York, Oakland,&lt;ref name="youtube" /&gt; Oregon,&lt;ref name="'Occupy Auckland' protest speaks with many voices3" /&gt; Denver and Zurich. For some of the other camps such as the one at St Pauls in London, no physical action was taken, but on 15 November authorities stepped up legal action to gain authorization for a forcible eviction. ''Financial Times'' editor [[Richard Lambert]] suggested that the shift to confrontational tactics by authorities would be more likely to spur on the movement rather than cause it to disband.&lt;ref name="globalCrackdown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cityBycity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Its camp is gone, but the Occupy movement will grow" /&gt; However, John Gapper, chief business commentator at the ''FT'', offered a different view. Gapper said that it may be advantageous that the camps were being closed down, as they were beginning to alienate even members of the public who were initially fully sympathetic with the movement.&lt;ref name="A better way to occupy Wall Street" /&gt; During a demonstration at [[UC Davis]] on 18 November 2011, campus police Lieutenant [[John Pike (police officer)|John Pike]] used [[pepper spray]] on seated students.&lt;ref name="UCD police chief placed on administrative leave" /&gt; The incident drew national attention and led to further demonstrations, petitions, and calls for Chancellor [[Linda P.B. Katehi]] to resign. (See: [[UC Davis pepper-spray incident]])&lt;ref name="wordpress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbslocal" /&gt; On 22 November, occupiers [[Human microphone|mic checked]] President Obama to draw his attention to the treatment they had received from the police, including thousands of arrests.&lt;ref name="cbsnews4" /&gt;

===26 November to 31 December 2011===
[[File:CarolineLucasBOI06Dec11.jpg|thumb|Green party leader [[Caroline Lucas]] discussing green economics with occupiers at London's ''Bank of Ideas'' on 6 December 2011]]
By December, occupiers had begun to divert their energies beyond [[protest camp]]s and a narrow focus on the banks, instead seeking to engage further with mainstream politics and joining forces with established activist groups to support causes broadly compatible with the interests of "the 99%". Interviewing one of the informal leaders of the movement, ''Financial Times'' journalist Shannon Bond found that issues of concern included: "the unemployment rate, household debt, student debt, the lack of prospects for people graduating from college and foreclosures."&lt;ref name="spreads"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2a65f048-201b-11e1-8462-00144feabdc0.html|title= Occupy sets its sights beyond Wall Street|work= [[Financial Times]]|author= Shannon Bond|date=7 December 2011|accessdate=9 December 2011}} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., [[Occupy Homes]] joined with other existing human rights activists groups and began to occupy foreclosed homes, disrupt bank auctions, and block evictions.&lt;ref name="Les-2011" /&gt;  On 1 December, two evicted activists in Portland, Oregon, planted a table on the plaza of Portland's City Hall and lit a candle, igniting a Prayer Vigil/Occupation of City Hall that lasted 18 months. On 22 December ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that some of the cities which had forcefully disbanded occupy camps were now facing legal challenges.&lt;ref name="Cities that broke up Occupy camps now face lawsuits over free speech, use of force" /&gt;

===1 January 2012 to 2016===
On 2 January 2012, [[Occupy Nigeria]] began, sparked by Nigeria's President [[Goodluck Jonathan]] announcing the ending of fuel subsidies in the country.  There was support from the global movement, but most of the activity took place in Nigeria itself, with a report from [[The Christian Science Monitor|CSM]] saying strikes were effectively shutting down whole cities.  On 16 January Jonathan responded by announcing he would bring prices back down by partially restoring the fuel subsidy.&lt;ref name="Occupy Nigeria victory: president to cut fuel prices" /&gt;

While students have been involved with Occupy since its inception, early 2012 has seen increasing formal interaction between the Occupy movement and academia. In the US, universities including [[Columbia University|Columbia]] and [[Roosevelt University|Roosevelt]] have begun offering courses about the movement, in the case of Columbia the course includes field work where students join in with Occupy activities. In Great Britain, Occupy's outwork teams are planning school visits to give talks about the movement and related issues.&lt;ref name="Occupy protest movement to go into schools" /&gt;&lt;ref name="University offers Occupy Wall Street course where students earn class credit by working 'in the field'" /&gt;&lt;ref name="University offers Occupy Wall Street course where students earn class credit by working 'in the field'5" /&gt;

On 23 January, EGT LLC (Export Grain Terminal) and the [[International Longshore and Warehouse Union]] (ILWU) reached a tentative agreement, mediated by [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state governor [[Christine Gregoire]].&lt;ref name="ILWU, EGT reach tentative deal in Longview labor dispute" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Port of Longview signs off on ILWU and EGT settlement" /&gt;  The agreement resolved a year-long dispute, paving the way for ILWU Local 21 workers to work inside the $200 million grain terminal at the [[Port of Longview]] in south-west [[Washington (state)|Washington state]].  This came after "Occupy the Ports" protests which shut down multiple ports on the west coast of the United States on 12 December.  The goals of those protests included support of longshoremen and truckers in disputes with EGT and terminal operator SSA Marine (partially owned by [[Goldman Sachs]]).&lt;ref name="bbc-occupy-west-coast-ports-shut-down" /&gt;
[[File:"Occupy DC" sign and tents from the Occupy Movement in downtown D.C.jpg|thumb|"Occupy DC" sign and tents in downtown Washington, D.C. October, 2011]]
A worldwide poll conducted in January 2012 found that only one third (37%) of respondents were familiar with the movement. Of the respondents who were aware of the movement, supporters of the movement outweighed those in opposition two to one.&lt;ref name="Jan2012Global" /&gt; In late January, Occupy protested at the [[World Economic Forum]].&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Merkel tells Davos forum Europe will fix debt problem" /&gt; On 17 March, [[Occupy Wall Street]] attempted to mark six months of the movement, by reoccupying [[Zuccotti Park]], the location of the first Occupy camp. Protestors were soon cleared away by police, who made over 70 arrests.&lt;ref name="Dozens arrested as Occupy Wall Street marks anniversary with fresh protests" /&gt; On 1 May, the Occupy movement marked a resurgence with a [[May Day]] general strike that took place in cities across the U.S., including New York; Washington, D.C.; Chicago; and Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Occupy movement returns for May Day protests in D.C., New York and around U.S." /&gt; This included a revival of the [[Free University of New York]].&lt;ref name="maydaynyc" /&gt;

On the weekend of 15 and 16 September, members of the Occupy movement gathered in Union Square, with direct action training on the 15th and a celebration of the movement on the 16th. On 17 September, the Occupy movement celebrated its first anniversary with several marches and general assemblies which were attended by thousands of protesters.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==June 2018-the present==
After an approximate 2 year hiatus in activism on location, the Occupy Movement organized the [[Occupy ICE]] phase in order to protest the actions of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement office regarding the detention of undocumented immigrants presenting themselves at the southern US border points to seek asylum. While small groups of protestors emerged across the country in protest of the separation of families who were detained during immigration processing, a group swarmed the ICE facility in SOHO, NYC, causing it to shutdown temporarily. In Washington state, hundreds of Occupy ICE activists took over a portion of the grounds of the Portland ICE building. The blockade caused the building to shutdown for several days, with ICE staff citing 'safety concerns'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/20/occupy-ice-portland-protest-immigration-family-separations|title=Occupy Ice: activists blockade Portland building over family separations|date=20 June 2018|publisher=theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 June, Feds ordered the protestors to vacate government environs or face arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2018/06/feds_order_occupy_ice_pdx_prot.html|title=Feds order Occupy ICE PDS protestors to abandon camp on their property or face arrest|date=25 June 2018|publisher=The Oregonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 June 2018, Federal officers moved in the early morning hours to remove and/or arrest protestors blockading the building. 8 protestors were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/federal-officers-move-to-reopen-portland-ice-building-closed-over-protests/ar-AAzhJT3?li=BBnbcA1|title=Federal officers move to reopen ICE building closed after protests |last=Silva|first=Daniella |date=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 300 protesters started occupying [[Paris]]'s financial district, [[La Défense]], on 4 November 2011.&lt;ref name="Sale Temps pour les indignés de la Défense"/&gt; Since then, their camp has been torn down by several police forces. According to French protestors, relations with the police have varied considerably. Some police joined them for coffee and friendly discussion, but otherwise were hostile and confiscated blankets and food, leaving protesters sleeping in the cold outdoors without protection. On 11 November, following a call made on social networks, some 400 additional people joined the occupation.&lt;ref name="Nouveau ressemblent des indignés de la Défense"/&gt; Occupy protests have also begun at Nantes, Lyon, Grenoble, Marseille,&lt;ref name="Huit personnes ont été placées en garde à vue après la dispersion par la police d'une"/&gt; Perpignan and more than 50 cities.&lt;ref name="Manifestation des Indignés.

===Mexico===
Occupy began in [[Mexico City]] on 11 October 2011, with a hunger strike in front of the [[Mexican Stock Exchange]] highrise. Edur Velasco, a 56-year-old labor economist and university professor, was on a 42-day-long hunger strike sitting in a tent outside Mexico City's stock market, demanding that the government guarantee greater access to higher education among the youth.&lt;ref name="Faces and reasons behind 'Occupy"/&gt; Days after his initiative, it came as a surprise to see the multiplication of tents setting up outside the stock exchange building. Police remained discreetly around the corner sitting in their trucks.&lt;ref name="Willing to die for change"/&gt;

Occupy Mexico did not achieve the level of popularity it gained in other areas. This is attributed to the fact that Mexico's Occupy protesters, which were focused on poverty and workers' rights, failed to resonate with a public enthralled by the violence of the [[Mexican Drug War]].&lt;ref name="Parish Flannery"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parish Flannery|first1=Nathaniel|title=Occupy Mexico?

Also known as Baluwatar Satyagraha, Occupy Baluwatar is a peaceful protest movement calling on the Nepali state to better address the widespread problem of impunity and gender-based violence. Since 28 December 2012, protesters have gathered outside the prime minister's official residence in Baluwatar from 9:00 to 11:00 am daily. The protesters created a coherent set of demands, divided into short- and long-term goals, which they presented to then prime minister Baburam Bhattarai. The short-term demands called on the state, including the police and the judiciary, to properly investigate and prosecute the guilty in five specific cases which took place immediately prior to the movement's start. The long-term demands focused on policy reform in the arenas of migration and rape laws, among others.

===Nigeria===
{{Main|Occupy Nigeria}}
Occupy Nigeria is an anti-fuel subsidy removal protest that started in Nigeria on 2 January 2012 in response to fuel subsidy removal by the Federal government of Nigeria on 1 January 2012. It is a movement against corruption in Government &amp; public service, insensitive &amp; inhuman treatment of Nigerians by Government &amp; Security agents. The movement ended on 16 January 2012 following agreement between the government and the organized labour leaders which saw a partial restoration of the subsidy regime. Fuel pump price in Nigeria has since then been fixed at the official rate of 97 naira per litre while it practically sells for as high as 130 naira in some major cities including Port Harcourt, one of the cities in the oil-producing states in Nigeria.

To date six towns and cities in Ireland have witnessed experienced Occupy camps; Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Letterkenny, and Athlone.&lt;ref name="OccupyIreland network is giving hope where previously there was none"/&gt; Protests were held in [[Dublin]],&lt;ref name="dublin_protest"/&gt; [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://annesheridanjournalist.blogspot.ie/2011/12/irelands-spirit-is-just-dead-occupy.html|title=Anne Sheridan: 'Ireland's spirit is just dead' - Occupy Limerick protesters|work=annesheridanjournalist.blogspot.ie|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Galway]].&lt;ref name="irish_times_protest"/&gt; ''[[The Irish Times]]'' described the movement in the following terms: ''"The group has no hierarchical structure, has set up a Facebook page and Twitter account – with the social media links attracting a very mixed, and sometimes critical, reaction."'' The protest in Dublin was organized by "Pots &amp; Pans – Ireland", and #OccupyDameStreet protest group, who then invited Real Democracy Now! Shell to Sea, Tir na Saor and many other non political groups to participate and all set up camp outside the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] in solidarity with the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement in New York. On 22 October it was reported that over 2,000 people took part in a demonstration organized by [[Occupy Dame Street]].&lt;ref name="peoplebeforeprofit"/&gt; This camp survived through the winter, but was removed by an Garda Síochána (Irish police) on 13 March 2012, days before the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade. On the morning of 16 May 2012 at approximately 4:30&amp;nbsp;am, the Occupy camp in Eyre Square in Galway, the longest-lasting of the Occupy groups in Ireland, was removed by An Garda Síochána and Galway City Council. The camp was removed because the group was illegally occupying a public amenity. At the time the camp was dismantled, there were only 6 protesters at the camp. The camp had lasted for 215 days.&lt;ref name="Occupy Galway protest camp is being removed by gardaí"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardaí dismantle last Occupy camp"/&gt;

===South Africa===
{{Main|Taking Back South Africa!}}
In South Africa, a movement called ''Taking Back South Africa!'' sprung up as an initiative primarily aimed at protesting and inciting [[Protest|mass action]] against the economic and [[social inequality]] in the country. It consists of a loose informal affiliation of on-the-ground groups and individuals across South Africa as well as internet based groups. During the 2016 Fees Must Fall movement, protest groups also adopted the slogan #Occupy4FreeEducation in response to the government's perceived lack of interest in dealing with the issue.&lt;ref name="wordpress8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="facebook9"/&gt;

===South Korea===
Hundreds of protesters held rallies in the South Korean capital of [[Seoul]] on 15 and 22 October in 2011 under the slogan of "Occupy Seoul". Protesters focused on issues such as a recent free trade agreement with the United States as well as costs of tuition and rent.&lt;ref name="hourb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seoul joins Occupy Wall Street movement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="S. Korean activists hold another 'Occupy Seoul' protests"/&gt;

"Occupy Seoul" began as a part of [[15 October 2011 global protests]]. Protesters gathered in several places in Seoul, including [[Yeouido]] (financial hub of Seoul) where protesters rallied under the slogan of "Occupy Yeouido: 99% against Financial Exploitation of 1%." Three primary requirements demanded by these protesters were: (1) clarifying the responsibility of the bureaucracy, (2) financial regulations, and (3) compensations for the victims of failed financial policies of Korean government. Other protesters, led by leftist organizations such as [[People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy]], gathered in front of Seoul train station and Daehanmoon. However, they failed to enter the Seoul City Hall Plaza as they had planned, as their protest permit was rejected by the police due to an exhibition that was already taking place in the Plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cho|first=Jae-hyun|title=Occupy Seoul: Anti-Wall Street protests land on Seoul|url=http://news1.kr/articles/402729|accessdate=31 March 2013|newspaper=News1|date=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there were considerable support from public, there were also criticisms regarding the nature of the protest. Unlike the original Occupy movement which started out as the anti-capitalist protest, many of the catchphrases of Occupy Seoul contained anti-government or anti-American messages. One of the observers has argued that "South Korea overcame the 2008 financial crisis relatively well and there was no serious crisis in financial sector. It is hard to find the legitimate basis of the protest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Park|first=Hoon-sang|title=Occupy Movements in 80 countries today; Seoul joins with an overnight protest|url=http://news.donga.com/3/all/20111015/41115765/1|accessdate=31 March 2013|newspaper=Dong-A Ilbo|date=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What started as an environmentalist protest against plans to replace Taksim Gezi Park developed into wider anti-government demonstrations. Demands issued on 4 June included

The [[Occupy Wall Street]] protests began in [[New York City]] on 17 September 2011.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; By 9 October, [[List of Occupy movement protest locations|similar demonstrations]] were either ongoing or had been held in 70 major cities and over 600 communities across the U.S.&lt;ref name="guardian2"/&gt; The movement rejects existing political institutions and attempts to create alternative ones through direct action and direct democracy.&lt;ref name="graeber1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="David Graeber, the Anti-Leader of Occupy Wall Street"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Occupy and anarchism's gift of democracy"/&gt; Occupy protesters' slogan, "We are the 99%", asserts that the "99%" pay for the mistakes of the "1%".
The original location of choice by the protesters was 1 Chase Plaza, the site of the "Charging Bull" statue, but when police discovered the planned site, it was fenced off and nearby Zuccotti Park was chosen. There was scant media coverage till 24 September when a large march forcing the closure of several streets resulted in 80 arrests. Police used a technique called "netting", the use of orange plastic nets to corral protesters, and the march received extensive media coverage when a video of several "netted" young women being pepper sprayed was widely circulated.&lt;ref name="Occupy Oakland: demonstrators prepare for police action – Monday 11 November 2011"/&gt;

Media coverage was again sparked on 1 October, when New York City protesters attempted to march across the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] and more than 700 arrests were made. Some said the police had tricked protesters, allowing them onto the bridge and even escorting them partway across before they began to make [[mass arrest]]s. On 25 October, police officers cleared two [[Occupy Oakland]] protest camp sites. Police fired [[tear gas]] canisters at the protestors, allegedly in response to objects being thrown at them.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Protest organizers said that many of the troublemakers were not part of the Occupy movement.&lt;ref name="Some Cities Begin Cracking Down on 'Occupy' Protests."/&gt; The raid was described as "violent and chaotic at times"&lt;ref name="Occupy Oakland Gets Shut Down11"/&gt; and resulted in over 102 arrests.

Police estimated that about 3,000 demonstrators were gathered at the port and 4,500 had marched across the city.&lt;ref name="bbc-15568057" /&gt;

At about 1:00&amp;nbsp;am on 15 November, police cleared the Zuccotti Park encampment. Many journalists complained that the police had made a deliberate decision to keep journalists away from the park during the raid.&lt;ref name="Occupy Wall Street: police evict protesters - as it happened"/&gt; New York City journalists responded to what they perceived as "alarming suppression, abuse and arrests of reporters" by forming "The Coalition for the First Amendment" to "monitor police-press relations as a way of spotlighting police activities that threaten constitutional protections".&lt;ref name="Coalition For the First Amendment"/&gt; Executive Director [[Alison Bethel McKenzie]] of the [[International Press Institute]] commented: "It is completely unacceptable to hinder reporting on a subject that is undoubtedly of public interest. Such reporting is vital to democracy, and authorities at every level of government – federal, state and local – must honour their constitutional obligation not to infringe upon the freedom of the press."&lt;ref name="IPI: Journalists Arrested Across the U.S. - TrustMedia"/&gt;

On 6 December, [[Occupy Homes]], an offshoot of Occupy Wall Street, embarked on a "national day of action" to protest the mistreatment of homeowners by big banks, who they say made billions of dollars off the [[housing bubble]] by offering [[predatory loan]]s and indulging in practices that allegedly took advantage of consumers. In more than two dozen cities across the nation the movement took on the housing crisis by re-occupying foreclosed homes, disrupting bank auctions and blocking evictions.&lt;ref name="Les-2011"/&gt; On 17 September 2012, protesters returned to Zuccotti Park to mark the one-year anniversary of the beginning of the occupation.&lt;ref name="NYT-2012anniv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ST-2012anniv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Politiker-2012anniv"/&gt;

==Reactions==
{{main|Reactions to the Occupy movement}}

===Political===
* Brazil—[[President of Brazil|President]] [[Dilma Rousseff]] said, "We agree with some of the expressions that some movements have used around the world [in] demonstrations like the ones we see in the US and other countries."&lt;ref name="latercera"/&gt;
* Canada—Finance Minister [[Jim Flaherty]] expressed sympathy with the protests, stating "There's growing worry about a lack of opportunities for the younger generation – particularly in the United States – and it's up to governments to ensure youth are able to capitalize on their education and find good jobs." He later commented, "I can understand some legitimate frustration arising out of that."&lt;ref name="Occupy Wall Street Protests hit Canada"/&gt;
* India—[[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Manmohan Singh]] described the protests as "a warning for all those who are in charge of the processes of governance".&lt;ref name="Occupy Wall Street protests a warning: PM"/&gt;
* Iran—Supreme Leader [[Ayatollah Khamenei]] voiced his support for the Occupy Movement saying, "Ultimately, it will grow so that it will bring down the capitalist system and the West."&lt;ref name="lach"/&gt;
* United Kingdom—On 21 October 2011, former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] said the protests were about fairness. "There are voices in the middle who say, 'Look, we can build a better financial system that is more sustainable, that is based on a better and proportionate sense of what's just and fair and where people don't take reckless risks or, if they do, they're penalized for doing so.'"&lt;ref name="Ex-British Chief Gorden Brown States Protests Seek Fairness"/&gt; On 6 November 2011, Opposition leader [[Ed Miliband]]: "The challenge is that they reflect a crisis of concern for millions of people about the biggest issue of our time: the gap between their values and the way our country is run." He mentioned that he is "determined that mainstream politics, and the Labour Party in particular, speaks to that crisis and rises to the challenge".&lt;ref name="Ed Miliband warns of St Paul's protest 'danger signals'"/&gt; On Saturday 26 November 2011, Edinburgh City Council set a worldwide precedent by voting in favour of the motion to support the aims and sentiments of Occupy Edinburgh and the Occupy movement as a whole. This motion was presented by the [[Scottish Green Party]], was seconded by the [[Scottish Labour Party]] and was slightly amended by the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) and [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]]. The only party not to back the motion was the [[Scottish Conservative Party]]. "We regard this as a fantastic step forward in the opening of dialogue with the Scottish government.", stated Occupy Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="Occupy Edinburgh ecstatic with official recognition"/&gt;
* United States—[[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] spoke in support of the movement, but also asked protesters not to "demonize" finance workers.&lt;ref name="Obamasupports"/&gt; Local authorities in the United States have collaborated to develop strategies to respond to the Occupy movement and its encampments, and political leaders in eighteen United States cities consulted on cracking down on the Occupy movement, according to Oakland Mayor [[Jean Quan]], who participated in a conference call.&lt;ref name="alternet"/&gt; Within a span of less than 24 hours, municipal authorities in [[Denver]], [[Occupy Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City]], [[Occupy Portland|Portland]], [[Occupy Oakland|Oakland]], and [[Occupy Wall Street|New York City]] sent in police to crack down on the encampments of the Occupy movement.&lt;ref name="thetakeaway"/&gt; In a markedly different approach, the city administration and police in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], have worked with Occupy New Haven&lt;ref name="occupynewhaven1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.occupynewhaven.org/ |work=occupynewhaven.org |date=13 November 2012 |title=What Is The Occupy Movement All About? |accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure the safety of protesters occupying the upper section of the New Haven Green.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newhavenindependent"/&gt; Until 18 April 2012, Occupy New Haven,&lt;ref name="occupynewhaven1"/&gt; has been running continuously on the Green for 186 days until they were removed by police.&lt;ref name="Occupy New Haven official website"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20120418/occupy-new-haven-encampment-cleared-out-13-protesters-arrested-videos-photos Occupy New Haven encampment cleared out; 13 protesters arrested (videos, photos)]. 18 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Venezuela—[[President of Venezuela|President]] [[Hugo Chávez]] condemned the "horrible repression" of the activists and expressed solidarity with the movement.&lt;ref name="Hugo Chavez condemns 'horrible repression' of Wall Street protests"/&gt;

===Media===
''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' has had various articles covering the movement.&lt;ref name="The Fight for 'Real Democracy' at the Heart of Occupy Wall Street"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Why Occupy Wall Street is Not the Tea Party of the Left"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How Occupy Wall Street Works"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Future of History"/&gt; In the January/February 2012 issue, [[Francis Fukuyama]] argued that the Occupy movement was not as influential as the right-wing Tea Party movement. "One of the most puzzling features of the world in the aftermath of the financial crisis," he wrote, "is that so far, populism has taken primarily a right-wing form, not a left-wing one."&lt;ref name="Francis Fukuyama on the decline of the middle class - PNHP's Official Blog"/&gt; In contrast, a survey for the think tank [[Center for American Progress]] suggested that the Occupy movement has succeeded in substantially boosting the coverage of the job crisis in the American media.&lt;ref name="ObamaReflects"/&gt;

===Other===
Egyptian protesters from [[Tahrir Square]] have lent their support of the movement. A message of solidarity issued by a collective of Cairo-based protesters declared: "As the interests of government increasingly cater to the interests and comforts of private, transnational capital, our cities and homes have become progressively more abstract and violent places, subject to the casual ravages of the next economic development or urban renewal scheme. An entire generation across the globe has grown up realizing, rationally and emotionally, that we have no future in the current order of things."&lt;ref name="To the Occupy movement – the occupiers of Tahrir Square are with you"/&gt;
In early December 2011, business magnate [[Richard Branson]] said the movement is a "good start", that they have been protesting for valid reasons, and that if the business community takes some of their concerns on board they will have made a difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2011/11/22/one-percenter-richard-branson-supports-occupy-protests/|title='One Percenter' Richard Branson Supports 'Occupy' Protests|accessdate=11 November 2012|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 2011, [[Jesse Jackson]] said that [[Jesus Christ]], [[Gandhi]], and [[Martin Luther King]] were all occupiers, and that: "Occupy is a global spirit, which is now sweeping the nation and the world, fighting for justice for all of God's children".&lt;ref name = "JesseJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jesse Jackson speaks at Occupy London: 'Occupy is a spirit whose time has come' - video"/&gt; A global survey of 23 countries published by [[Ipsos]] on 20 January 2012 found that around 40% of the world's citizens are familiar with the movement. Over twice as many reported a favourable response to the movement compared to those who dislike it. Support for the movement varied markedly among countries, with South Korea (67%), Indonesia (65%), and India (64%) reporting the highest sympathy – while Australia (41%), Japan (41%), and Poland (37%) reporting the lowest.&lt;ref name="Jan2012Global"/&gt;

==Impact==
Some known impacts to date include the following:

===Social impact===
In the United States, the protests have helped shift the focus of national dialogue from the federal budget deficit to economic problems many ordinary Americans face, such as unemployment,&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt; the large amount of student and other [[consumer debt|personal debt]] that burdens middle class and working class Americans,&lt;ref name="tikkun"/&gt; and other major issues of social inequality, such as homelessness.&lt;ref name="alternet13"/&gt; The movement appears to have generated a national conversation about income inequality, as evidenced by the fact that print and broadcast news mentioned the term "income inequality" more than five times more often during the last week of October 2011 than during the week before the occupation began.&lt;ref name="politico"/&gt; Longer term effects are much less clear, as according to Google search trends, in the years since 2012 interest has waned. Occupy movement raised awareness regarding what organizers consider undeserved wealth and lack of fairness in American society.&lt;ref name="nytimes-99-percenters-and-53-percenters-face-off"/&gt; Labor unions have become bolder in the tactics they employ and have been using digital social media more effectively thanks to the Occupy movement.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; In New York City, the Occupy Wall Street protest has also provided hundreds of protesters to help in picket actions conducted by labor unions.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

Offshoots of the Occupy movement, such as [[Rolling Jubilee]], a project of Strike Debt, have bought millions in "zombie debt," money that individuals owe that they have no financial means to pay, including medical debt, to free the debtors from the obligation to pay it off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20130509/BETTERLIFE05/305090068/-Zombie-debt-part-1-1-million-Louisville-medical-bills-bought-by-Wall-Street-protesters 'Zombie Debt' Part of $1.1 Million in Louisville Medical Bills Bought by Wall Street Protesters: Louisvillian's Medical Bill Among Those Wiped out by Nonprofit Group] The Courier-Journal 10 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2014, Rolling Jubilee claims to have cancelled more than $15 million in medical debt and $4 million in private student loan debt.&lt;ref&gt;Liz Pleasant, Christa Hillstrom and James Trimarco (17 September 2014).

On 10 November 2011, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that the word "occupy" had been the "most commonly used English word on the internet and in print" over the past 12 months according to a top ten list published by media analysis company [[Global Language Monitor]].&lt;ref name="wardrop1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Top Words of 2011"/&gt; In January 2012, members of the [[American Dialect Society]] voted with an overwhelming majority for "Occupy" as the word of the year for 2011.&lt;ref name="Linguists name 'occupy' as 2011's word of the year"/&gt; Numerous news shows and radio shows have been using the term "1%" and "99%" TV shows such as ''The Middle'', ''Revenge'' and, ''The Office'' have made references to Occupy, and, in July 2012, the City of Vancouver added the word to its list of reserve names for civic assets such as streets and buildings.&lt;ref name="vancouver"/&gt; In December 2012, the Television show Conan launched a contest called "Occupy Conan."

===Political impact===
On 27 December 2011, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' argued that the movement had had a global impact, altering "the terms of the political debate."&lt;ref name="Capitalism is dead; long live capitalism"/&gt; However, some sympathetic commentators such as Anthony Barnett have suggested that in Spain, where the movement once had the support of well over 70% of the population with millions taking part, the popularity of ''Occupy'' is now past its peak and has achieved no consequences of any significance.&lt;ref name = "Long"/&gt; However, there were numerous successes at local levels,&lt;ref name="Thank You, Anarchists"/&gt; and ''[[The Economist]]'' has reported that Spanish protesters caused their government to pass various laws including new limits on the amounts banks can "claw" back from defaulting borrowers.&lt;ref name="earnest"/&gt;
In November 2011, U.S. Congressman [[Ted Deutch]], member of the [[House Judiciary Committee]], introduced the "Outlawing Corporate Cash Undermining the Public Interest in our Elections and Democracy (OCCUPIED) Constitutional Amendment," which would overturn the [[United States Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'' recognizing corporate constitutionally protected free speech rights and would ban corporate money from the electoral process.&lt;ref name="house"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thinkprogress"/&gt;

In March 2012, former U.S. [[Vice President]] [[Al Gore]] called on activists to "occupy democracy", explaining that "Our democracy has been hacked. It no longer works to serve the best interests of the people of this country."&lt;ref name="cnet"/&gt; Also in November 2011, [[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]] said that the Occupy movement had started to dynamically shape the global policy response to the [[Late-2000s financial crisis]], being mentioned so often at [[2011 G-20 Cannes summit|the 2011 G20 summit]] that if Occupy had been a brand "it would have a profile to die for among the super-elite".&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Various journalists along with [[Jared Bernstein]] former chief economist and economic adviser to [[Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]], have suggested that Occupy influenced the President's January 2012 [[State of the Union address]], with the movement creating the political space for Obama to shift to the economic left and speak about the desirability of the rich paying a greater share of the tax burden. Inequality has remained a central theme of President Obama's reelection campaign, yet he no longer mentions the Occupy movement by name, which analysts say reflects the fact that by early 2012 Occupy had become a divisive issue, unpopular with some of the public.&lt;ref name="ObamaReflects"/&gt;&lt;ref name="State of the union: President Obama addresses inequality"/&gt;&lt;ref name="democracynow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="No more inaction on income inequality"/&gt;

Three years later, income inequality had become a major part of the political discourse and ''[[The Atlantic]]'' Magazine declared "The Triumph of Occupy Wall Street"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/the-triumph-of-occupy-wall-street/395408/ |title=The Triumph of Occupy Wall Street| publisher=The Atlantic | first=Michael | last=Levitin | date=10 June 2015 | accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National monitoring and crackdown==
Government documents released in December 2012 pursuant to [[Freedom of Information Act]] requests by the [[Partnership for Civil Justice Fund]] reveal FBI monitoring of what became known as the Occupy movement since at least August 2011, a month before the protests began.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/29/fbi-coordinated-crackdown-occupy |title=Revealed: how the FBI coordinated the crackdown on Occupy|last=Wolf|first=Naomi |date=29 December 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Partnership for Civil Justice Fund, 22 December 2012, "[http://www.justiceonline.org/commentary/fbi-files-ows.html FBI Documents Reveal Secret Nationwide Occupy Monitoring]"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FBI]], the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]], local police, regional law enforcement "counterterrorism" [[fusion center]]s, and private security forces of major banks formed the [[Domestic Security Alliance Council]] (DSAC) to collect and share information about, and to share plans to target and to arrest Occupy protesters. Banks met with the FBI to pool information about participants of the Occupy movement collected by corporate security, and the FBI offered to bank officials its plans to prevent Occupy events that were scheduled for a month later.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name=grant&gt;Grant, Drew (24 December 2012).

==Lawsuits==
Following actions by police and municipal officials to use force in closing various Occupy tent camps in public spaces, lawsuits have been filed, while others are being planned.&lt;ref name="niedowski"/&gt; Civil liberties organizations filed separate law suits against the FBI for refusing to turn over documents requested pursuant to the [[Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) regarding the FBI's role in surveillance of the Occupy movement and the FBI's sharing of intelligence about Occupy events with private corporate security officials.&lt;ref name="ACLU 2012-09-14"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[American Civil Liberties Union]]|date=14 September 2012|title=FOIA Documents Show FBI Was Watching Occupy Protestors, Some Docs Still Secret on National Security Grounds|url=https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-speech-national-security/foia-documents-show-fbi-was-watching-occupy-protestors-some-docs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI withheld documents requested under the FOIA citing the reason that the withholding was "in the interest of national defense or foreign policy."&lt;ref name="ACLU 2012-09-14"/&gt;

In 2013, MIT doctoral student [[Ryan Shapiro]], collecting research on the role of the FBI in the Occupy movement, sent the FBI three FOIA requests regarding "a potential plan to gather intelligence against the leaders of [Occupy Wall Street-related protests in [[Houston]]] and obtain photographs, then formulate a plan to kill the leadership [of the protests] via suppressed [[sniper]] rifles."  When the FBI refused the request, Shapiro filed a federal complaint in Washington, D.C., and subsequently obtained 17 pages (most of the requested documentation was ruled withheld due to the possibility to "disclose the identity of a confidential source.") The redacted FBI document confirmed the Houston plot and contradicted an earlier claim by the FBI that it had never opened an investigation on the Occupy movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Courthouse News Service]]|date=6 February 2015|title=FBI Gets OK on Alleged Murder Plot Info Cache|url=https://www.courthousenews.com/fbi-gets-ok-on-alleged-murder-plot-info-cache/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/03/18/fbi-ordered-to-justify-shielding-of-records-sought-about-alleged-occupy-sniper-plot/ | title=FBI Ordered to Justify Shielding of Records Sought About Alleged 'Occupy' Sniper Plot | newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]| date=18 March 2014 | accessdate=23 March 2014 | author=Gershman, Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End==
By 2015, there were no more Occupy events chasing the same original goals. Instead, there were multiple reported protests that had similar methods to the Occupy movement, with different goals.

"Occupy" has since become a style of protest, as [[Occupy Silicon Valley]] is aimed at tech wealth as well as general inequality caused by technology and its advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/22/notable-wall-street-strategist-tech-rally-may-lead-to-calls-to-redistribute-silicon-valleys-wealth.html|title=Occupy Silicon Valley: The next populist movement may be aimed at tech wealth, report says|first=Evelyn|last=Cheng|date=22 May 2017|work=cnbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Apart from the dismissals made by political conservatives, there have also been appreciative criticisms from more [[left-wing]] scholars. One such critique concerns itself with the way in which the Occupy movement has focused its demands around a narrowly modern understanding of freedom that differs little from the claims of mainstream liberal pluralism:

{{quote| The modern ideology of freedom ... provides its point of departure. This singular dominance of the modern becomes clear in the long list of demands that follow. Practicality dominates and there is not a single demand for relief from the ontological dominance of modern practices and subjectivities that abstract, codify, rationalize and objectify our lives. Though the ideals and demands ... are laudable, they are not that much different in form from the Millennium Goals of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2013 | last1= Steger | first1= Manfred B. | last2= James | first2= Paul | authorlink2= Paul James (academic) | title= 'Levels of Subjective Globalization: Ideologies, Imaginaries, Ontologies' | url= https://www.academia.edu/4311113/Levels_of_Subjective_Globalization_Ideologies_Imaginaries_Ontologies | journal= Perspectives on Global Development and Technology | volume=12 | issue=1–2 | pages=37–38. | doi=10.1163/15691497-12341240}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

International activists involved in the Occupy Movement have seen it stall due a lack of synergy to work with other alternative movements calling for change. The biggest criticism is that the movement is without depth, without a lasting vision of an alternative future.

In her critique of the Occupy movement, American political philosopher [[Jodi Dean]] argues that the focus on autonomy, leaderlessness and horizontality paved the way for conflicts and disillusionment within the movement:

{{quote|Emphasis on autonomy encouraged people to pursue multiple, separate and even conflicting goals rather than work toward common ones. Celebration of horizontality heightened skepticism toward organizing structures  like the General Assembly  and the Spokes Council, ultimately leading to the dissolution of both. assertions of leaderlessness as a principle incited a kind of paranoia around leaders who emerged but could not be acknowledged or held accountable as leaders. So rather than solving the problem of left political organization  by focusing on process and immediate questions of action, as anarchism suggests, Occupy Wall Street in fact poses it anew. It pushes us to think again about the role of a communist party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dean|first=Jodi|date=2012 |title=The Communist Horizon|url=|location= |publisher=Verso|page=210 |isbn=978-1844679546|author-link=Jodi Dean}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Remarks from Occupy Wall Street participant [[Justine Tunney]], a [[Google]] software engineer, who called on President Obama to appoint [[Eric Schmidt]] "CEO of America", have also sparked criticism, including from the vast majority of other Occupy participants, many of whom have observed that her politics are inconsistent with horizontalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/20/occupy-founder-obama-eric-schmidt-ceo-america|title=Occupy founder calls on Obama to appoint Eric Schmidt 'CEO of America'|author=Alex Hern|work=the Guardian|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bgr.com/2014/03/20/eric-schmidt-ceo-of-america-wtf/|title=Eric Schmidt, CEO of America?

Many [[Occupy Wall Street]] protests have included [[anti-zionist]] and [[anti-semitism|anti semitic]] slogans and signage such as "Jews control Wall Street" or "Zionist Jews who are running the big banks and the Federal Reserve". As a result, the Occupy Wall Street Movement has been consistently confronted with accusations of anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Jennifer Rubin|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/occupy-wall-street-does-anyone-care-about-the-anti-semitism/2011/03/29/gIQA43p8rL_blog.html|title=Occupy Wall Street: Does anyone care about the anti-Semitism?|work=The Washington Post|date=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joseph Berger"&gt;{{cite web|author=Joseph Berger|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/nyregion/occupy-wall-street-criticized-for-flashes-of-anti-semitism.html?_r=0|title=Cries of Anti-Semitism, but Not at Zuccotti Park|work=The New York Times|date=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/10/19/rnc-says-dems-silent-as-anti-semitic-tone-emerges-at-occupy-wall-street.html|title=Republicans Accuse Dem Leaders of Silence in Face of 'Anti-Semitic' Tone Occupying Protest Movement|work=Fox News|date=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/10/12/wall-street-protester-proclaims-the-jews-control-wall-st-in-zuccotti-park-rant/|title=OWS Protester Proclaims 'The Jews Control Wall St.' In Zuccotti Park Rant|work=CBS News|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Abe Greenwald |url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/anti-semitism/occupy-wall-street-has-an-anti-semitism-problem/ |title=Occupy Wall Street Has an Anti-Semitism Problem |work=Commentary Magazine|date=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Abraham Foxman, national director of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] stated that "it's not surprising that in a movement that deals with economic issues you're going to get bigots that believe in this stereotype...[however] they are not expressing or representing a larger view."&lt;ref name="Joseph Berger"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11095">The '''Porn Art Movement''' (Movimento de Arte Pornô) was a transgressive Brazilian [[avant-garde]] movement that started in 1980 and ended in 1982. The movement took place under a [[Brazilian military government|military dictatorship]]  and pioneered the use of pornography both as a form of political resistance and as an innovative art medium.&lt;ref&gt;Cunha, Maria C. “Arte Pornô, a última dos novos poetas.” ''Folha de S. Paulo'' (Ilustrada), February 10th, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was formally experimental, politically progressive and socially non-normative. It used the word “porn” deliberately but it did not produce conventional pornography. Rather, it rejected erotica, which was accepted by the dictatorship,&lt;ref&gt;''Playboy'' magazine started publication in Brazil in 1975, one of the harshest periods of the military dictatorship. This was a time of rampant police brutality, when political prisoners were tortured and killed with impunity. In 1982, the President of Brazil, General João Figueiredo, made headlines calling for a "crusade against pornography." See: "Figueiredo convoca a nação para combater pornografia." ''Jornal do Brasil'', March 16th, 1982, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and subverted the logic of pornography to create social, political and aesthetic alternatives that employed humor, scatology, surprise, poetry, performance, body politics and [[pansexuality]]. Organized and coordinated activities ended in 1982, but isolated performances were realized and publications came out until 1984. The book ''Antolorgia'', published in 1984, was the last publication of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Movimento de Arte Pornô (Porn Art Movement), also known as Poesia Pornô (Pornpoetry) or Pornismo (Pornism), was conceived by [[Eduardo Kac]] in January 1980 in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Kac invited [[Cairo Trindade]]&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigues, Dolores. “Poesia Pornô: Liberta, aberta e honesta”. ''ArteManha'', Rio de Janeiro, January/February 1982, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; to develop the movement together and they launched it publicly on March 30, 1980, through their Ipanema Beach intervention called ''Pelo Topless Literário'' (''Literary Topless'').&lt;ref&gt;''Gang'', n. 1, May 1980, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a sudden invasion of the beach’s Lifeguard Post 9 (Posto Nove) with performances, poetry readings, demonstrations with banners featuring slogans, and distribution of publications. Lifeguard Post 9 was a strategic choice: it was considered at the time the epicenter of the beach (and, as a consequence, a major focal point of the city).

Soon after the ''Literary Topless'' intervention, Kac and Trindade invited Teresa Jardim to join them, thus forming the official performative arm of the movement, which they called Gang (The Gang). Braulio Tavares, Ana Miranda, Cynthia Dorneles and Sandra Terra also performed with The Gang.

Kac and Trindade wrote the ''Manifesto Pornô'' (''Porn Manifesto'') in May 1980 and first published it in the movement’s zine ''Gang'', n. 1, September 1980.  The movement published a total of three editions of the ''Gang'' zine, in addition to chapbooks, stickers, t-shirts, prints, comics, artist’s books and anthologies.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1980 and 1982, every Friday night The Gang performed at [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]]’s main square known as Cinelândia, a vibrant and busy area surrounded by the Municipal Theatre, the National Library, the Rio de Janeiro City Council and the [[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes|National Museum of Fine Arts]]. In front of a public that mixed intellectuals and popular audiences, the Gang read out loud the ''Porn Manifesto'' on September 9, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The selection of Cinelândia was also a strategic maneuver, since it is the heart of Rio de Janeiro.

On February 13, 1982, the Gang presented its last major public intervention, which took place in Ipanema Beach’s Lifeguard Post 9.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; This event, which Kac considers the formal end of the movement,&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; mobilized 9 performers, explored the entire repertoire developed during the preceding two years, included a wide array of props and publications, climaxed with a nude demonstration along the beach (which was and still is forbidden by law&lt;ref&gt;In 2011, Rio de Janeiro Police arrested three Dutch tourists for being naked in Copacabana Beach.  [http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/naked-dutch-tourists-arrested-rio]&lt;/ref&gt;), mobilized public participation, and culminated with a collective dive in the ocean—a symbolic act meant to signify self-renewal, the beginning of a better path forward beyond the prevailing political and aesthetic conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;Ronái, Cora. “A Caminhada Pornô,” ''Pasquim'', n. 660, February 18th to 24th, 1982, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[videographer]] Belisario Franca, then a photographer, accompanied The Gang between 1980 and 1982, producing photographic documentation of many of its interventions.

The Brazilian Porn Art Movement anticipated the international use of pornography as a critical and imaginative art form, as later seen in the work of Jeff Koons, Annie Sprinkle, Sue Williams, Santiago Sierra, Shu Lea Cheang, Wim Delvoye and the artists featured in the 2006 DVD compilation entitled ''Destricted''.&lt;ref&gt;The DVD compilation ''Destricted'' was organized by P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center curatorial adviser Neville Wakefield and featured artists such as Marina Abramović, Larry Clark, and Matthew Barney.&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement started to be rediscovered in 2010, when the Laura Marsiaj Gallery, in Rio de Janeiro, exhibited Eduardo Kac’s series entitled ''Pornogramas'' (''Pornograms''), developed by the artist between 1980 and 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rioecultura.com.br/expo/expo_resultado2.asp?expo_cod=1453 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054235/http://www.rioecultura.com.br/expo/expo_resultado2.asp?expo_cod=1453 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }} ; [http://www.canalcontemporaneo.art.br/_v3/site/evento.php?idioma=br&amp;id_evento=5278]&lt;/ref&gt; The first museum exhibition of the Brazilian Porn Art Movement took place at the Reina Sofía Museum, in Madrid, in the context of the group show ''Losing the Human Form'', realized in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museoreinasofia.es/exposiciones/actuales/perder-forma-humana_en.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The museum published a catalogue that features the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Nogueira, Fernanda; Henaro, Sol. “Overgoze,” in: ''Vv.Aa., Perder la forma humana. Una imagen sísmica de los años ochenta en América Latina'' (Madrid: Museo Reina Sofia, 2012), pp. 199-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art forms==

The Porn Art Movement produced work in a variety of media, including performance, poetry, [[graffiti]], drawing, photography, cartoon and the graphic arts. Glauco Mattoso created an innovative form that he called ''Jornal Dobrabil'', a self-printed double-sided sheet designed entirely on a typewriter that was visually provocative and mixed indiscriminately classic, experimental and popular pornographic material.&lt;ref&gt;Glauco Mattoso, ''Jornal Dobrabil'' (São Paulo: Iluminuras, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Hudinilson Jr. created a visual vocabulary based on his systematic sampling of his own body through reprographic media, notably the photocopier. Leila Míccolis, Teresa Jardim and Cynthia Dorneles developed their respective poetic voices through a form of feminism that combined unabashed pornography and liberal political positions. Ota produced invitations, posters, cartoons and comics through which he advanced the movement’s agenda while inviting the movement’s participants and the public to laugh. The poetry of Braulio Tavares and the drawings of Siegbert Franklin were also significant contributions to the movement. Publicly forging a new subjectivity, Eduardo Kac wore a pink mini-skirt in his daily life. Kac also developed the innovative series entitled ''Pornograms'', hybrid of body art, design, political resistance, performance, publishing, activism, photography and poetry. In this series Kac uses photography to explore the possibilities of writing with the body and writing the body itself. Kac included two ''Pornograms'' in his artist’s book ''Escracho'', which he published in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital-libraries.saic.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/jfabc/id/3079/rec/6]&lt;/ref&gt;

Discerned at the headquarters of the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]] in Paris, it encompasses several categories, with the winners being selected by an independent judges panel. It is the world architecture award for stores, hotels and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diversum.net/fichiers/File/%28fr%29_Prix_Versailles_21-04-2016.pdf {{fr}} Press release from 21 April 2016] (accessed on 24 August 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose and process==
Following a call for submissions, this award singles out the architects and owners of shops and stores, hotels and restaurants around the world that are found to be particularly remarkable, from a perspective of their exterior architecture and their interior design. The prix focuses on commercial buildings, with the clear aim of fostering a better mix of the economic and cultural sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diversum.net/fichiers/File/%28en%29_Prix_Versailles_30-05-2016.pdf Press release from 30 May 2016] (accessed on 24 August 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irina Bokova]], Director-General of [[UNESCO]], declared on 19 June 2015, "The Prix Versailles is one of the ways to shine light on the intersection between creation, art and economics".&lt;ref&gt;[http://diversum.net/fichiers/File/%28en%29_Prix_Versailles_22-06-2015.pdf Press release from 22 June 2015] (accessed on 24 August 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=February 2018}}
'''Red Herring''' is an artist's collective based in [[Brighton]], England. Founded in 1985&lt;ref name=gentrification2017 /&gt; as a non-profit making company, the group was set up to provide affordable [[Studio]] space for artists with the common stated aim of increasing public awareness of the [[visual arts]], both locally, nationally and further afield. In keeping with its aims the group has always sought to achieve a balance of varied practises across the [[arts]] and [[craft]]s, and a balance of gender.

==Background==

As part of its stated aims, Red Herring Studios has provided affordable studio space for professional artists throughout its existence. This has been achieved by renting low cost redundant industrial premises due for redevelopment and dividing the space provided into working areas. In order to encourage cross discipline discussion and collaboration the separate artists spaces have always been kept open and interconnected.

The studio group subsequently became an [[Industrial and provident society]] with charitable status.
The studio group is funded entirely by its members, in the form of rent. 

Throughout the first decade the studio group ran a gallery space within its premises, this was discontinued when several members set up '''Fabrica''', an artist run contemporary art gallery and commissioner of new work, housed in the former [[Holy Trinity Church, Brighton|Holy Trinity Church]] in [[Brighton]] City centre.

In 2017 Red Herring were faced with eviction from their Westerman Complex home in [[Hove]], when plans were made to demolish it and build houses on the site.&lt;ref name=gentrification2017&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.brightonandhoveindependent.co.uk/news/gentrification-pushing-creatives-out-of-brighton-and-hove-1-7855807 |title=‘Gentrification’ pushing creatives out of Brighton and Hove |work=Brighton &amp; Hove Independent |date=8 March 2017 |accessdate=18 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artists==
Each of its premises has housed an average of 24 artists, over the years several hundred artists have been members. 
[[Paul Greenhalgh]] head of research at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] considered Red Herring to be "an organisation of significant historical importance."{{cite quote|date=February 2018}}

The term "Red Herring Artists" refers both to individual members and the Artists group as a whole. As a group Red Herring Artists have been involved in countless collaborations and group projects, many of which are [[public art]] projects and festival events.

Many individual Red Herring Artists have achieved critical acclaim{{cn|date=February 2018}} and together have worked throughout the world.

The '''Reich Chamber of Culture''' ('''''Reichskulturkammer''''') was a [[government agency]] in [[Nazi Germany]]. It was established by law on 22 September 1933 in the course of the ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' process at the instigation of Reich Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] as a professional organization of all German creative artists.&lt;ref name="Overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005207|title=Culture in the Third Reich: Overview|date=June 10, 2013|work=[[Holocaust Encyclopedia]]|publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defying the competing ambitions of the [[German Labour Front]] (DAF) under Goebbels' rival [[Robert Ley]], it was meant to gain control over the entire cultural life in Germany creating and promoting Aryan art consistent with [[Nazism|Nazi]] ideals.

Every artist had to apply for membership on presentation of an [[Aryan certificate]]. A rejected inscription ''de facto'' resulted in an occupational ban.

== Structure and organisation ==
The RKK was affiliated with the [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] with its seat on [[Wilhelmplatz]] in [[Berlin]]. Headed by Goebbels himself, a [[Secretary of state|state secretary]] of his ministry served as vice president:
[[File:Reichsmusikkammer1001.jpg|upright|thumb|The 1935 [[Reichsmusikkammer|Reich Chamber of Music]] decree to the Berlin musician Werner Liebenthal dictating the immediate cessation of his professional activity.]]
*[[Walther Funk]] (1933–1938)
*[[Karl Hanke]] (1938–1941)
*Leopold Gutterer (1941–1944)
*[[Werner Naumann]] (1944–1945)
''[[Schutzstaffel|SS]]'' officer [[Hans Hinkel]] was one of the officers in charge of the chamber and Goebbels' special commissioner for the removal of [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jews]] from German cultural life.

Different subdivisions of the RKK dealt with [[Reichsmusikkammer|music]], visual arts, [[Reichsfilmkammer|film]], architecture, and literature, organized in seven departments:
*''[[Reichsfilmkammer]]'', headed by [[Carl Froelich]] from 1939
*''[[Reichsmusikkammer]]'', headed by [[Richard Strauss]], from 1935 by [[Peter Raabe]]
*''Reichskammer der bildenden Künste'' ("Reich Chamber of Fine Arts") ([[:de:Reichskammer der bildenden Künste|de]]), headed by [[Eugen Hönig]] from 1933, by [[Adolf Ziegler]] from 1936, and by [[Wilhelm Kreis]] from 1943
*''Reichstheaterkammer'', headed by [[Rainer Schlösser]] 1935–1938, by [[Paul Hartmann (actor)|Paul Hartmann]] from 1942
*''Reichsschrifttumskammer'', headed by [[Hans-Friedrich Blunck]], from 1935 by [[Hanns Johst]]
*''Reichspressekammer'', headed by [[Max Amann]]
*''Reichsrundfunkkammer'' (tasks assigned to ''[[Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft]]'' in 1939)

The RKK was ultimately dissolved and its assets confiscated by Law no. 2 (October 10, 1945) of the [[Allied Control Council]]. Footage and archives material are kept by the [[German Federal Archives]] (''Bundesarchiv'') and the [[Berlin Document Center]].

== Degenerate art ==
[[File:Ausstellung entartete kunst 1937.jpg|thumb|upright|Goebbels visits the 1938 ''Entartete Kunst'' exhibition in Berlin]]
The RKK played a significant role in the Nazi oppression of [[Modern art]], defamed as "[[Cultural Bolshevism]]". One notable project of the ''Bildende Künste'' (Fine Arts) division under Adolf Ziegler was the ''[[Degenerate Art Exhibition|Entartete Kunst]]'' exhibition, of works deemed "[[Degenerate Art|degenerate]]."&lt;ref name="Disseminating"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007519|title=Culture in the Third Reich: Disseminating the Nazi Worldview|date=June 10, 2013|work=[[Holocaust Encyclopedia]]|publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opened in July 1937 at the [[Hofgarten (Munich)|Hofgarten]] in [[Munich]], touring exhibitions were held from 1938 to 1941 in several major German cities such as Berlin, [[Leipzig]], [[Düsseldorf]], [[Salzburg]], and [[Hamburg]]. Attendance was measured in the millions (perhaps largely because entrance was free), and the so-called degenerate art may have been more popular with the public than the Nazis anticipated. Goebbels had supported German [[expressionist]]s until Hitler intervened and expressed his disgust at artists such as [[Max Liebermann]] and [[Emil Nolde]].

'''''Seraphim Falls''''' is a 2006 American [[Revisionist Western]] film directed by television producer and director [[David Von Ancken]] in his first [[feature film]]. The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by Von Ancken and Abby Everett Jaques. The fictional story focuses on a [[Bounty hunter|bounty hunt]] for a Union soldier by a Confederate colonel following the [[American Civil War]] in the late 1860s. [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Liam Neeson]], [[Michael Wincott]], [[Tom Noonan]], and [[Ed Lauter]] star in principal roles. ''Seraphim Falls'' explores civil topics, such as violence, human survival and war.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;David Von Ancken. (2007). ''Seraphim Falls'' [Motion picture]. United States: [[Icon Productions]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was produced by the motion picture studio of [[Icon Productions]]. It was commercially distributed by [[Samuel Goldwyn Films]] and [[Destination Films]] theatrically, and by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] for home media. The film score was composed by musician [[Harry Gregson-Williams]], although a soundtrack version for the motion picture was not released to the public.

''Seraphim Falls'' premiered at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival and was released to theaters in limited release in the United States on January 26, 2007 grossing $418,296 in domestic ticket sales. It earned an additional $801,762 in box office business overseas for a combined worldwide total of $1,220,058 in revenue. The film was generally met with positive critical reviews before its initial screening in cinemas. The widescreen DVD edition of the film featuring scene selections and a bonus featurette, was released in the United States on May 15, 2007.

==Plot==
In 1868, within the [[Ruby Mountains]], Gideon ([[Pierce Brosnan]]) roasts hare over an open fire. Suddenly, gunshots ring out with one striking his left arm. He grabs what he can and races down the mountain. His attackers emerge from their cover to inspect his campsite. Colonel Morsman Carver ([[Liam Neeson]]), a former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] officer, is accompanied by Pope ([[Robert Baker (actor)|Robert Baker]]), Hayes ([[Michael Wincott]]), Parsons ([[Ed Lauter]]) and the Kid ([[John Robinson (American actor)|John Robinson]]); who are all engaged in a bounty operation to apprehend him.&lt;ref name=film /&gt;

After removing the bullet from his arm with his hunting knife at a secluded locale, Gideon leaves an open fire burning, which attracts the posse. He ends up killing Pope with his knife and then ventures out again into the wilderness. He attempts to steal a horse, but is caught by a young woman named Charlotte (Shannon Zeller) who helps him after she realizes he is injured. She redresses his wound and her family lets him sleep overnight in their farmhouse. He later offers to buy their horse and leaves before daybreak. As the group of men approach Gideon's trail, he lays an ambush using a [[Animal trapping|bear trap]] which impales the Kid, who is then shot by Carver as an act of mercy. Later, Parsons decides to leave the other men following the discovery of a dead bank robber ([[James Jordan (actor)|James Jordan]]), whom Gideon had killed earlier in an act of self-defense and whose bounty money exceeds Gideon's.&lt;ref name=film /&gt; As Parsons is preparing to load the dead body to take to Carson City for the reward money, Carver shoots the horse - which he declares is his, leaving Parsons to walk the 30 miles back to town carrying the body.

Encountering a railroad under construction, Gideon hitches his horse and steals some food. The foreman recognizes the stolen horse and detains Gideon. Carver and his remaining man, Hayes, come upon the railroad site and search for Gideon. Meanwhile, Gideon escapes from custody and makes off with another horse. As Carver and Hayes draw closer, Gideon's horse can no longer take the strain of the heat and collapses. Gideon euthanizes the horse with his knife. When Carver and Hayes finally reach the horse's carcass, Hayes dismounts and marvels at what type of an animal would disembowel the creature. Suddenly, Gideon leaps out from the horse's belly, where he had been hiding, and grabs Hayes threatening to kill him if Carver doesn't give up his gun. Carver instead shoots Hayes with his last bullet. Confronting each other, Carver and Gideon recall the events that put them at odds. After the end of the [[American Civil War]], Gideon was ordered to track down former Confederate officers. When he arrived at Carver's home in Seraphim Falls to interrogate him, Carver was out in a nearby field. To coerce Carver's wife ([[Angie Harmon]]) into revealing his whereabouts, and believing that their house was empty, Gideon ordered their barn to be set on fire. The blaze quickly spread to the house, as Carver returned from the cropland. While the soldiers restrained him, his wife and son ran inside the house to save their infant child who was still in a bedroom. Both men look on with horror at the unfolding tragedy; trapped by the flames, Carver's wife and children perish. Gideon, racked with guilt over the tragedy, is seen dropping his gunbelt and walking away from his men.&lt;ref name=film /&gt;

The two men fight, Gideon eventually getting the better of Carver. He points Carver in the direction of a town and tells him that he will get nothing but torment if he continues his pursuit. Gideon takes the horses ridden by Carver and Hayes and sets off deeper into the countryside. When Carver later catches up with Gideon, both men are on the brink of exhaustion. They confront each other again with their pistols. Gideon shoots Carver in the side but, instead of finishing him off, he offers himself to Carver. Carver decides not to shoot him and throws his pistol aside. Gideon helps Carver to his feet and the two men walk into the distance away from one another. In a final scene, Gideon takes his knife, which he has used throughout the film, and throws it into the ground.&lt;ref name=film /&gt;

Notable similarities have been found between the film and the 1976 revisionist western, ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' directed by [[Clint Eastwood]].&lt;ref name="holden"&gt;Holden, Stephen (26 January 2007).

In a mixed review, Christy Lemire writing in the ''[[Deseret News]]'' mused about the lead characters, stating, "Their climactic confrontation is visually arresting in its starkness. But as an anti-war statement, a call to lay down arms that's clearly intended to be relevant today, it's a bit too clunky in its literalism." She ultimately found the film to be "technically solid" but a "dramatically unremarkable Western".&lt;ref&gt;Lemire, Christy (2 March 2007).

Retrieved 2011-04-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Todd McCarthy of the [[Variety (magazine)|Variety staff]] believed the film was "nothing rousing or new" and that Brosnan along with Neeson wouldn't be enough "to muster more than modest theatrical B.O. for this very physical but familiar oater." He did however reserve praise for the cinematography noting, "Its physical beauty notwithstanding – Toll's work, which emphasizes the blues and greens of the forests, is always a pleasure to behold".&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Todd (18 September 2006).

Claudia Puig writing for ''[[USA Today]]'' offered an almost entirely positive review recalling how she thought the film was a "psychological drama with an intriguing ambiguity that challenges the viewer's loyalties and preconceived notions." She remarked that the storyline was an "elaborate and relentless chase that takes those involved into primal psychological terrain."&lt;ref&gt;Puig, Claudia (26 January 2007).

[[Stephen Holden]] writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' applauded some of the realism displayed in the film, commenting, "Nothing in the rest of the film comes close to matching the impact of Gideon’s carving the bullet from his arm with his hunting knife, then cauterizing the wound while emitting agonizing howls. This scene is enough to give you vicarious hypothermia." He also expressed his satisfaction with the visual attributes of the picture by saying "Its strongest element is the austere majesty of the cinematography by John Toll (''"[[Braveheart]],"'' ''"[[Legends of the Fall]],"'' ''"[[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|The Thin Red Line]]"''), in which the severe beauty of the Western landscape looms over the characters as a silent rebuke."&lt;ref name="holden"/&gt; Critic Josh Rosenblatt, writing for ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' viewed ''Seraphim Falls'' as "Meditative, beautifully shot, and blessed with a healthy dose of cynicism" and a "morality play without the morality and a Western Purgatorio that, in the end, demands its protagonists resign themselves to their loneliness and brutality and avail themselves of the redemptive power of sheer exhaustion."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblatt, Josh (26 January 2007).

Peter Rainer of ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' highlighted the film's merits by declaring that it was "essentially one long, bleak stalk-and-kill action thriller. From the rugged snowscapes to the cracked desert vistas, director David Von Ancken and cinematographer John Toll serve up a whole lot of eye candy from the great outdoors." He added, "The film functions as a kind of survivalists' guide, and there's a morbid pleasure in seeing how Gideon extricates himself from one impossible situation after another."&lt;ref&gt;Rainer, Peter (2 February 2007).

'''Slab-O-Concrete Productions''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mail order]] [[Direct market|distributor]] and [[publisher]], founded by Peter Pavement, Dave Hanna, Emma Copsey, and Chris Tappenden; operating mostly in [[Brighton and Hove]] during the 1990s. Initially selling [[United Kingdom|British]] [[small press]] [[comics]] and [[zine]]s (including Pavement's own comics), Slab-O-Concrete also imported publications from the [[United States]], [[Australia]], and [[Europe]].

Slab-o-Concrete was originally based in [[Sheffield]]; it moved to [[Brighton and Hove|Hove]] in 1995. After intensely ramping up its publishing line in the late nineties (including moving into CDs and prose books), Slab-O-Concrete was laid low in 2001 as policy changes in the book industry caused cash-flow issues.

== History ==
In general, Slab-O-Concrete avoided distributing traditional [[comic book]]s, instead making connections with [[Underground comix|underground]] publishers, [[zine]]sters, [[independent record label]]s, and other [[Subculture|subcultural]] scenes.

By 1994 Slab-O-Concrete had developed into a publisher, repackaging small press comics and zines for the bookshop market and originating new works. Notable creators published by Slab-O-Concrete included [[Jessica Abel]], [[Ian Carney]], [[Craig Conlan]], [[Alan Moore]], [[Woodrow Phoenix]], and [[Aleksandar Zograf]].

In 1998, Slab-O-Concrete published four titles in partnership with [[Amnesty International]]. The comics were designed as 16-page [[minicomics]] with card stock covers, designed to be sealed and used as postcards. [[ILYA|Ilya]]'s ''A Bowl of Rice'' was about the forcible relocation and killing of [[Shan people|Shan]] rice farmers in [[Burma]]. Enrique Rodríguez's ''Freedom from Discrimination'' was a story about maltreatment of and violence against street children in [[Brazil]], and undocumented, unaccompanied immigrant children in the [[United States]]. Dan Jones' ''Just Deserts'' told the story of a female [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[migrant worker]]'s false conviction and punishment in [[Saudi Arabia]]. Peter Arkle's ''Love'' told the story of Mariana Cetiner, a [[Romanians|Romanian]] woman arrested and imprisoned for allegedly attempting to seduce another woman. In 1999, Slab-O-Concrete published another 16-page mailable minicomic called ''Donna's Day'', by Donna Mathes and [[Peter Bagge]].

One of their final publications, in 1999, was ''The Worm: the Longest Comic Strip in the World'', by [[Alan Moore]] and a "galaxy of greats," which was published in association with the Cartoon Art Trust and the Swedish Council for Cultural Affairs. "In one single working day, over 125 British cartoonists gathered together in one place to create 'the longest comic [wordless] strip in the world.'"&lt;ref&gt;''The Worm'' (Slab-O-Concrete Productions, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Worm'' featured introductions and explanatory text in English, Swedish, and French.

== Instrumentation ==

The symphony is scored for [[string orchestra]] (minimum 6 first [[violin]]s, 5 second violins, 4 [[viola]]s, 4 [[cello]]s, and 2 [[double bass|basses]]).&lt;ref name="JC"/&gt;

==Form==

The piece consists of five movements:&lt;ref name="JC"/&gt;

*I. Prelude
*II. Scherzo
*III. Nocturne
*IV. Fugue
*V. Postlude

==Composition==

Based on his ''[[String Quartet (Corigliano)|String Quartet]]'' (1995), as Corigliano explains: "My quartet is in five movements, three of which are notated in spatial notation. This means that the players do not count beats, but play more freely rhythmically, coordinating at various points but totally independent in others," requiring rewriting of this and other issues for larger ensemble.&lt;ref name="JC"/&gt;

==Reception==

The piece was awarded the 2001 [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]].&lt;ref name="JC"/&gt;

==Notable recordings==

'''Trafalgar Square''' ({{IPAc-en|t|r|ə|ˈ|f|æ|l|ɡ|ər}} {{respell|trə|FAL|gər}}) is a [[public square]] in the [[City of Westminster]], [[Central London]], built around the area formerly known as [[Charing Cross]]. Its name commemorates the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], a [[Royal Navy|British naval]] victory in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] with France and Spain that took place on 21 October 1805 off the coast of [[Cape Trafalgar]].

The site of Trafalgar Square had been a significant landmark since the 13th century and originally contained the [[Royal Mews|King's Mews]]. After [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] moved the mews to [[Buckingham Palace]], the area was redeveloped by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], but progress was slow after his death, and the square did not open until 1844. The {{convert|169|ft|adj=on}} [[Nelson's Column]] at its centre is guarded by four lion statues. A number of commemorative statues and sculptures occupy the square, but the [[Fourth Plinth]], left empty since 1840, has been host to contemporary art since 1999.

The square has been used for community gatherings and political [[demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], including [[Bloody Sunday (1887)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1887, the culmination of the first [[Aldermaston March]], anti-war protests, and campaigns against [[climate change]]. A [[Christmas tree]] has been donated to the square by Norway since 1947 and is erected for twelve days before and after Christmas Day. The square is a centre of annual celebrations on [[New Year's Eve]]. It was well known for its [[feral pigeon]]s until their removals in the early 21st century.

Building work on the south side of the square in the late 1950s revealed deposits from the last [[interglacial]]. Among the findings were the remains of [[Panthera leo spelaea|cave lion]], [[rhinoceros]], [[straight-tusked elephant]] and [[hippopotamus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the track of Ice Age mammals|last=Sutcliffe|first=A.J.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1985|isbn=0674637771|location=https://archive.org/stream/ontrackoficeagem00sutc|pages=139|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franks|first=J.W.|title=Interglacial deposits at Trafalgar Square, London.|journal=The New Phytologist|year=1960|volume=59|pages=145–150|jstor=2429192|subscription=yes|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1960.tb06212.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1960.tb06212.x/pdf|title=Interglacial Deposits at Trafalgar Square, London|author=J W Franks|publisher=University of Manchester|date=9 September 1959|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site of Trafalgar Square has been a significant location since the 13th century. During [[Edward I of England|Edward&amp;nbsp;I]]'s reign, the area was the site of the [[King's Mews]], running north from the original [[Charing Cross]], where the [[Strand, London|Strand]] from [[City of London|the City]] met [[Whitehall]] coming north from [[Westminster]].{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=934}} From the reign of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] to that of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], the mews was at the western end of the Strand. The name "Royal Mews" comes from the practice of keeping [[hawk]]s here for [[moulting]]; "mew" is an old word for this. After a fire in 1534, the mews were rebuilt as stables, and remained here until [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] moved them to [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/visit/royalmews/about/the-history-of-the-royal-mews|title=The History of the Royal Mews|publisher=Royal Collection Trust|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clearance and development ===
After 1732, the King's Mews were divided into the Great Mews and the smaller Green Mews to the north by the Crown Stables, a large block, built to the designs of [[William Kent]]. Its site is occupied by the National Gallery.{{sfn|Mace|1976|p=29}} 

In 1826 the Commissioners of H.M. Woods, Forests and Land Revenues instructed [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] to draw up plans for clearing a large area south of Kent's stable block, and as far east as St Martin's Lane. His plans left open the whole area of what became Trafalgar Square, except for a block in the centre, which he reserved for a new building for the Royal Academy.&lt;ref name=survey /&gt; The plans included the demolition and redevelopment of buildings between St Martin's Lane and the Strand and the construction of a road (now called Duncannon Street) across the churchyard of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]].{{sfn|Mace|1976|p=37}} The Charing Cross Act was passed in 1826 and clearance started soon after.&lt;ref name=survey /&gt; Nash died soon after construction started, impeding its progress. The square was to be named for [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] commemorating his ascent to the throne in 1830.{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=176}} Around 1835, it was decided that the square would be named after the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] as suggested by architect [[George Ledwell Taylor]], commemorating [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]]'s victory over the French and Spanish in 1805 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=934}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9TBOcU1WXEcC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=%22trafalgar+square|title=Wanderlust: Based on the true-life journals of Sydney Taylor|first=Marc|last=Cardinal|publisher=AuthorHouse|p=209|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4490-7907-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the clearance, development progressed slowly. The National Gallery was built on the north side between 1832 and 1838 to a design by [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]],&lt;ref name=survey&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=68408&amp;strquery=wilkins%20trafalgar%20square%20national |title=Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery |author=G.

He dealt with the complex sloping site by excavating the main area to the level of the footway between Cockspur Street and the Strand,&lt;ref name=ce&gt;{{cite journal |year= 1840|title=Public Buildings &amp;c Trafalgar Square|journal=The Civil Engineer and Architect's Journal |volume=3 |page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; and constructing a {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} high balustraded terrace with a roadway on the north side, and steps at each end leading to the main level.&lt;ref name=report /&gt; Wilkins had proposed a similar solution with a central flight of steps.&lt;ref name=am /&gt; Plinths were provided for sculpture and pedestals for lighting. All the stonework was of Aberdeen [[granite]].&lt;ref name=report /&gt; In 1841 it was decided that two fountains should be included in the layout.{{sfn|Mace|1976|p=107 }} The estimated budget, excluding paving and sculptures, was £11,000.&lt;ref name=report /&gt; The earth removed was used to level [[Green Park]].&lt;ref name=ce /&gt; The square was originally surfaced with [[tarmacadam]], which was replaced with stone in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=westminster&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bradley |first1=Simon|last2= Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus |title=London 6: Westminster |series=The Buildings of England |year= 2003 |publisher=Yale UniversityPress |isbn= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trafalgar Square was opened to the public on 1 May 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cunningham|first1=Peter|title=Handbook of London Past and Present|date=1849|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=lxv|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yKoxAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR65&amp;dq|chapter=London Occurrences 1837–1843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nelson's Column ===
[[File:Lion-nelson-column-trafalgar-london-uk.jpg|thumb|left|The lions at [[Nelson's Column]] were not finished until nearly 30 years after the square opened.| alt=The lions at Nelson's Column]]
[[Nelson's Column]] was planned independently of Barry's work. In 1838 a Nelson Memorial Committee had approached the government proposing that a monument to the victor of Trafalgar, funded by public subscription, should be erected in the square. A competition was held and won by the architect [[William Railton]], who proposed a {{convert|218|ft|3|in|m}} [[Corinthian order|Corinthinan]] column topped by a statue of Nelson and guarded by four sculpted lions. The design was approved, but received widespread objections from the public. Construction went ahead beginning in 1840 but with the height reduced to {{convert|145|ft|3|in|m}}.{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=177}} The column was completed and the statue raised in November 1843.{{sfn|Mace|1976|page= 90}}

The last of the bronze reliefs on the column's pedestals was not completed until May 1854, and the four lions, although part of the original design, were only added in 1867.{{sfn|Mace|1976|pp=107–8}} Each lion weighs seven tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Bow Bells - A Magazine of General Literature|year=1867 |publisher=John Dicks|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=5M0aAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=Landseer+seven+tons&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo04T8-YPTAhWM1ywKHSVhD00Q6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Landseer%20seven%20tons&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hoarding remained around the base of Nelson's Column for some years and some of its upper scaffolding remained in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Opening of Trafalgar Square |newspaper=The Times |date=31 July 1839 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Landseer, the sculptor, had asked for a lion that had died at the [[London Zoo]] to be brought to his studio. He took so long to complete sketches that its corpse began to [[decomposition|decompose]] and some parts had to be improvised. The statues have paws that resemble cats more than lions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/11268400/Londons-secret-sights-16-more-odd-attractions-you-never-knew-were-there.html?frame=3155177|title=The faulty lions of Trafalgar Square|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry was unhappy about Nelson's Column being placed in the square. In July 1840, when its foundations had been laid, he told a parliamentary select committee that "it would in my opinion be desirable that the area should be wholly free from all insulated objects of art".&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{Citation |title=Report from the Select Committee on Trafalgar Square together with the Minutes of Evidence|year=1840 |publisher=Printed by the House of Commons |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xFcAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] developed secret plans to transfer Nelson's Column to [[Berlin]]{{efn|Hitler had specifically requested that all of [[Rembrandt]]'s paintings in the National Gallery be seized as part of the move, as he particularly admired the artist's work.{{sfn|Longmate|2012|p=137}}}} after an expected [[Operation Sea Lion|German invasion]], as related by [[Norman Longmate]] in ''If Britain Had Fallen'' (1972).{{sfn|Longmate|2012|p=137}}

The square has been Grade I listed on the [[Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England|Register of Historic Parks and Gardens]] since 1996.&lt;ref name=NHLEGarden&gt;{{NHLE|num=1001362|desc=Trafalgar Square|access-date=11 July 2017|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Redevelopment ===
A major 18-month redevelopment of the square led by [[Atkins (company)|W.S. Atkins]] with [[Foster and Partners]] as sub-consultants was completed in 2003. The work involved closing the eastbound road along the north side and diverting traffic around the other three sides of the square, demolishing the central section of the northern retaining wall and inserting a wide set of steps to the pedestrianised terrace in front of the National Gallery. The construction includes two lifts for disabled access, public toilets and a café. Access between the square and the gallery had been by two crossings at the northeast and northwest corners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trafalgar Square redevelopment|publisher=Foster+Partners|url=http://www.fosterandpartners.com/projects/trafalgar-square-redevelopment/|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=935}}

Barry's scheme provided two plinths for sculptures on the north side of the square.&lt;ref name=gn /&gt; A bronze [[equestrian statue]] of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] by Sir [[Francis Chantrey]], originally intended to be placed on top of the [[Marble Arch]],&lt;ref name=survey /&gt; was installed on the eastern plinth in 1844, while the other remained empty until late in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=gn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov-news.org/gov/uk/news/270_suggestions_for_trafalgar_squares_vacant/40121.html|title=Suggestions for Trafalgar Square's Vacant Plinth|publisher=Government News|date=27 December 1999|accessdate=27 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208134336/http://www.gov-news.org/gov/uk/news/270_suggestions_for_trafalgar_squares_vacant/40121.html|archive-date=8 December 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two other statues on plinths, both installed during the 19th century: General Sir [[Charles James Napier]] by [[George Cannon Adams]] in the south-west corner in 1855, and Major-General Sir [[Henry Havelock]] by [[William Behnes]] in the south-east in 1861.&lt;ref name=survey /&gt; In 2000, the [[Mayor of London]], [[Ken Livingstone]], suggested replacing the statues with figures more familiar to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Kelso|title=Mayor attacks generals in battle of Trafalgar Square|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,385413,00.html|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 October 2000|accessdate=25 May 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fourth plinth ====
{{Main|Fourth plinth, Trafalgar Square}}
In the 21st century, the empty plinth in the north-west corner of the square, the "Fourth Plinth", has been used to show specially commissioned temporary artworks. The scheme was initiated by the [[Royal Society of Arts]] and continued by the Fourth Plinth Commission, appointed by the Mayor of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/arts-and-culture/art-and-design/fourth-plinth|title=Fourth Plinth|publisher=Greater London Council|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other sculptures ===
There are three busts of admirals against the north wall of the square. Those of [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Lord Jellicoe]] (by Sir [[Charles Wheeler (sculptor)|Charles Wheeler]]) and [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Lord Beatty]] (by [[William McMillan (sculptor)|William MacMillan]]) were installed in 1948 in conjunction with the square's fountains, which also commemorate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Discovering London Statues and Monuments |last=Baker |first=Margatet |year=2008 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title=McMillan,_William_(1887–1977),_sculptor|title=McMillan, William (1887–1977)|publisher=Your Archives, [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]|accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third, of the [[World War II|Second World War]] [[First Sea Lord]] [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Admiral Cunningham]] (by [[Franta Belsky]]) was unveiled alongside them on {{Nowrap|2 April}} 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=|first=|title=Bust of Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope by Franta Belsky|url=http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title=Bust_of_Viscount_Cunningham_of_Hyndhope_by_Franta_Belsky|volume=|pages=|publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)#"Your Archives"|Your Archives, The National Archives]]|accessdate=27 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the south side of Trafalgar Square, on the site of the original Charing Cross, is a bronze [[Equestrian statue of Charles I, Charing Cross|equestrian statue of Charles I]] by [[Hubert Le Sueur]]. It was cast in 1633, and placed in its present position in 1678.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Gorton (writer)|John Gorton]]: ''A Topographical Dictionary of Great Britain and Ireland'', 1833, p. 687&lt;/ref&gt;

The two statues on the lawn in front of the National Gallery are the [[Statue of James II, Trafalgar Square|statue of James II]] by [[Grinling Gibbons]] to the west of the portico, and of one [[George Washington]], a [[George Washington (Houdon)|replica of a work]] by [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], to the east.{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=935}} The latter was a gift from the Commonwealth of [[Virginia]], installed in 1921.{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=875}}

Two statues erected in the 19th century have since been removed. One of [[Edward Jenner]], pioneer of the [[smallpox vaccine]], was set up in the south-west corner of the square in 1858, next to that of Napier. Sculpted by [[William Calder Marshall]], it showed Jenner sitting in a chair in a relaxed pose, and was inaugurated at a ceremony presided over by [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. It was moved to [[Kensington Gardens]] in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1858 |title=The Jenner Monument |journal=Dublin Hospital Gazette |volume=5 |page=176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45228 |title=Kensington Gardens |author=Edward Walford |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1878 |work=Old and New London: Volume 5 |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other, of General [[Charles George Gordon]] by [[Hamo Thornycroft]], was erected on an 18-foot high pedestal between the fountains in 1888. It was removed in 1943 and re-sited on the [[Victoria Embankment]] ten years later.{{sfn|Mace|1976|pp=125–126}}

== Fountains ==
[[File:Trafalgar square fountain, June 7 2014.JPG|thumb|Fountain at Trafalgar Square, 2014|alt=Fountain at Trafalgar Square, 2014]]
In 1841, following suggestions from the local paving board, Barry agreed that two fountains should be installed to counteract the effects of reflected heat and glare from the asphalt surface. The First Commissioner of Woods and Forests welcomed the plan because the fountains reduced the open space available for public gatherings and reduced the risk of riotous assembly.{{sfn|Mace|1976|p=87}} The fountains were fed from two wells, one in front of the National Gallery and one behind it connected by a tunnel. Water was pumped to the fountains by a steam engine housed in a building behind the gallery.&lt;ref name=survey /&gt;

In the late-1930s it was decided to replace the pump and the centrepieces of the fountains. The new centrepieces, designed by Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]], were memorials to [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Lord Jellicoe]] and [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Lord Beatty]], although busts of the admirals, initially intended to be placed in the fountain surrounds were placed against the northern retaining wall when the project was completed after the Second World War.{{sfn|Mace|1976|pp=130–1}} The fountains cost almost £50,000. The old ones were presented to the Canadian government and are now located in [[Ottawa]]'s [[Confederation Park]] and [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]]'s [[Wascana Centre]].&lt;ref name="Guardian 20090529"&gt;{{citation|title=Trafalgar Square fountain spurts to new heights|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/may/29/trafalgar-square-fountains-reopen|newspaper=The Guardian|date=29 May 2009 | location=London | first=Maev | last=Kennedy | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GardenFoundation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trafalgar Square fountains|url=http://www.garden-fountain.co.uk/trafalgar.asp|year=2003|accessdate=16 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:People feeding pigeons in Trafalgar Square c.1993.jpg|thumb|People sitting on lions and feeding pigeons in the square|alt=Pigeons flocking to London's Trafalgar Square]]
The square was once famous for [[feral pigeon]]s and feeding them was a popular activity. Pigeons began flocking to the square before construction was completed and feed sellers became well known in the Victorian era.{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=181}} The desirability of the birds' presence was contentious: their droppings disfigured the stonework and the flock, estimated at its peak to be 35,000, was considered a [[Rock pigeon#Human health|health hazard]].&lt;ref name=pidgeons /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=House Guests, House Pests: A Natural History of Animals in the Home|first=Richard|last=Jones|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2015|p=85|isbn=978-1-4729-0624-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stall seller, Bernie Rayner, infamously sold bird seed to tourists at inflated prices.&lt;ref name=ipidgeon&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-pigeons-have-gone-but-visitors-are-flocking-to-trafalgar-square-2041675.html|title=The pigeons have gone, but visitors are flocking to Trafalgar Square|first=Andy|last=McSmith|newspaper=The Independent|date=23 October 2011|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==

=== New Year ===
For many years, revellers celebrating the [[New Year]] have gathered in the square despite a lack of celebrations being arranged. The lack of official events was partly because the authorities were concerned that encouraging more partygoers would cause overcrowding. Since 2003, a firework display centred on the [[London Eye]] and [[South Bank]] of the [[River Thames|Thames]] has been provided as an alternative. Since 2014, New Year celebrations have been organised by the Greater London Authority in conjunction with the charity [[Unicef]], who began ticketing the event to control crowd numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.london.gov.uk/get-involved/events/london-nye-2015-fireworks|title=London New Year's Eve with Unicef.|work=Greater London Authority|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christmas ===
{{See also|Trafalgar Square Christmas tree}}
[[File:Trafalgar Square Christmas tree8.jpg|thumb|upright|The Trafalgar Square Christmas tree in 2008|alt=The Trafalgar Square Christmas tree]]

A [[Christmas]] ceremony has been held in the square every year since 1947.&lt;ref name=bbctree /&gt; A [[Norway spruce]] (or sometimes a [[fir]]) is presented by Norway's capital city, [[Oslo]] as London's [[Christmas tree]], a token of gratitude for Britain's support during World War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref name=bbctree /&gt; (Besides war-time support, Norway's [[Olav V of Norway|Prince Olav]] and the country's government lived in exile in London throughout the war.&lt;ref name=bbctree /&gt;)

The Christmas tree is decorated with lights that are switched on at a seasonal ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/events/tree-lighting#?tab=map&amp;map=SignificantWeather&amp;zoom=8&amp;lon=-0.12&amp;lat=51.51&amp;fcTime=1362477600|title=Trafalgar Square tree lighting ceremony|publisher=Met Office|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually held twelve days before Christmas Day.

Westminster City Council threatened to abandon the event to save £5,000 in 1980 but the decision was reversed.&lt;ref name=bbctree&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/for_christmas/_new_year/christmas_decorations/39383.stm|title=Shedding light on Christmas|work=BBC News|date=21 December 1997|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tree is selected by the Head Forester from Oslo's [[municipal forest]] and shipped, across the [[North Sea]] to the [[Port of Felixstowe]], then by road to Trafalgar Square. The first tree was {{convert|48|ft|m}} tall, but more recently has been around {{convert|75|ft|m}}. In 1987, protesters chained themselves to the tree.&lt;ref name=bbctree /&gt; In 1990, a man sawed into the tree with a chainsaw a few hours before a New Year's Eve party was scheduled to take place. He was arrested and the tree was repaired by [[Arborist|tree surgeons]] who removed gouged sections from the trunk while the tree was suspended from a crane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-12-31/news/mn-5771_1_tree-square-trafalgar|title=Man Takes Chain Saw to Trafalgar Square Tree, but Tannenbaum Stands|author=Associated Press|date=31 December 1990|accessdate=22 December 2015|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political demonstrations ===
[[File:Rally in Trafalgar Square.jpg|thumb|left|A demonstration in Trafalgar Square|alt=A demonstration in Trafalgar Square]]
The square has become a social and political focus for visitors and Londoners, developing over its history from "an [[esplanade]] peopled with figures of national heroes, into the country's foremost ''place politique''", as historian Rodney Mace has written. Since its construction, it has been a venue for political demonstrations.{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=935}} The great [[Chartism|Chartist]] rally in 1848, a campaign for social reform by the working class began in the square.{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=935}} A ban on political rallies remained in effect until the 1880s, when the emerging [[Labour movement]], particularly the [[Social Democratic Federation]], began holding protests. On {{Nowrap|8 February}} 1886 (also known as "Black Monday"), protesters rallied against unemployment leading to a riot in [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]]. A larger riot (''"[[Bloody Sunday (1887)|Bloody Sunday]]"'') occurred in the square on {{Nowrap|13 November}} 1887.{{sfn|Crick|1994|p=47}}

The [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]'s first [[Aldermaston Marches|Aldermaston March]], protesting against the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]] (AWE), began in the square in 1958.{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=935}} One of the first significant demonstrations of the modern era was held in the square on {{Nowrap|19 September}} 1961 by the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]], which included the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]]. The protesters rallied for peace and against war and nuclear weapons. In March 1968, a crowd of 10,000 demonstrated against US involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] before marching to the [[Embassy of the United States, London|American Embassy]] in [[Grosvenor Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/17/newsid_2818000/2818967.stm |title=On This Day – 17 March – 1968: Anti-Vietnam demo turns violent |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2008 |website=bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DemonstrationAgainstAntiTerrorismLawLondon23Jan.jpg|thumb|Protesting against harassment of photographers under anti-terrorism law, 23 January 2010|alt=Protests]]
Throughout the 1980s, a continuous anti-[[apartheid]] protest was held outside South Africa House. In 1990, the [[Poll Tax Riots]] began by a demonstration attended by 200,000 people and ultimately caused rioting in the surrounding area.{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=935}} More recently, there have been anti-war demonstrations opposing the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan War]] and the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Keith Flett|title=The Committee of 100: Sparking a new left|url=http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/article.php?article_id=5114|journal=[[Socialist Worker]]|issue=1933|date=8 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large vigil was held shortly after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|terrorist bombings in London]] on Thursday, {{Nowrap|7 July}} 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=London falls silent for bomb dead|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4679681.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=14 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, participants from the Camp for Climate Action occupied the square for the two weeks during which the UN Conference on Climate Change took place in [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/actions/copenhagen-2009/cop15-out |title=COP OUT CAMP OUT Âť Camp for Climate Action |publisher=Climatecamp.org.uk |accessdate=26 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929120826/http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/actions/copenhagen-2009/cop15-out |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was billed as a UK base for direct action on climate change and saw various actions and protests stem from the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2009/12/443493.html?c=on#c239066 |title=UK Indymedia – Climate protestors scale Canadian Embassy and deface flag |publisher=Indymedia.org.uk |date=15 December 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2009/12/443706.html |title=UK Indymedia – Climate Camp Trafalgar- Ice Bear action |publisher=Indymedia.org.uk |date=18 December 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2009/12/443698.html |title=UK Indymedia – Thur Dec 17 protest outside Danish Embassy, London |publisher=Indymedia.org.uk |date=17 December 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, the square was occupied by a crowd protesting against the UK Budget and proposed budget cuts. During the night the situation turned violent as the escalation by riot police and protesters damaged portions of the square.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikinews:Battle for Trafalgar Square, London as violence breaks out between demonstrators and riot police]]&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015 a vigil against the [[November 2015 Paris attacks|terrorist attacks in Paris]] was held.

Every year on the anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar ({{Nowrap|21 October}}), the [[Sea Cadet Corps (United Kingdom)|Sea Cadet Corps]] holds a parade in honour of Admiral Lord Nelson and the British victory over the combined fleets of Spain and France at Trafalgar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/9624106/Sea-Cadets-in-Battle-of-Trafalgar-parade.html|title=Sea Cadets in Battle of Trafalgar parade|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=21 October 2012|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal British Legion]] holds a Silence in the Square event on [[Armistice Day]], 11 November, in remembrance of those who died in war. The event includes music and poetry readings, culminating in a [[bugler]] playing the [[Last Post]] and a [[two-minute silence]] at 11 am.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34783337|title=Armistice Day: Nation remembers war dead|work=BBC News|date=11 November 2015|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, Trafalgar Square has been the location for several sporting events and [[victory parade]]s. In June 2002, 12,000 people gathered to watch the [[England national football team]]'s [[FIFA World Cup 2002|World Cup]] quarter-final against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] on giant video screens which had been erected for the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=England fans mourn defeat|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/england_v_brazil/newsid_2055000/2055509.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=21 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The square was used by the [[England national rugby union team]] on {{Nowrap|9 December}} 2003 to celebrate their victory in the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/rugby_world_cup/3300061.stm|title=England honours World Cup stars|work=BBC Sport|date=9 December 2003|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on {{Nowrap|13 September}} 2005 for the [[England national cricket team]]'s victory in [[the Ashes]] series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/ashes_2005/4239254.stm|title=Fans hail England's Ashes heroes|work=BBC News|date=13 September 2005|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Satan Exulting over Eve.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Satan Exulting Over Eve'' by [[William Blake]]. The subject of the bull deals with the devil and his corruption of innocents through fornication.]]

'''''Vox in Rama''''' ({{lang-la|A voice in [[Ramah in Benjamin|Rama]]}}) is a [[papal bull]] issued by [[Pope Gregory IX]] in either 1232, 1233 or 1234 condemning a German heresy known as ''Luciferian'', a form of [[Satanism|devil worship]].&lt;ref name="Deane2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jennifer Kolpacoff Deane|title=A History of Medieval Heresy and Inquisition|date=2011|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-0-7425-6811-2|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bull was issued to [[Henry (VII) of Germany|King Henry]], son of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]], in June 1233 and subsequently to [[Siegfried III (Archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Siegfried III]] of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]] demanding they use all efforts to stop the practice.

==Background==
[[File:Konrad von Marburg.jpg|thumb|left|The inquisitor Konrad of Marburg, detail of a 13th-century church window, [[Elisabeth Church (Marburg)|Elisabeth Church]], Marburg. It was likely Konrad's report on the cult that inspired ''Vox in Rama''.]]

The 13th century was a time of great superstition and saw the start of the "demonisation of heretics"&lt;ref name=Kors&gt;{{cite book |last=|first=|editor-first=Alan Charles |editor-last=Kors |title=Witchcraft in Europe, 400-1700: A Documentary History|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|edition=2|date=2000|page=114 |chapter=IV: Popes, Theologians, Preachers, Lawyers and Judges |isbn=0812217519}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Church, attributing their lack of belief in the Catholic faith to the devil. Barber claims that it was during this time that there was a great zeal for the sending out of inquisitors by the [[pope]] and local bishops with the aim of seeking out potential [[Heresy|heretics]].&lt;ref name=Barber1&gt;{{cite book |last=Barber|first=Malcolm|editor-first= |editor-last=|title=The Trial of the Templars |publisher=Cambridge University Press|edition=2|date= 2006 |page=114 |chapter=10: Conclusion |isbn= 0521672368}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1233, [[Konrad von Marburg]] (sometimes anglicized as Conrad of [[Marburg]]) began an inquisition in Mainz at the behest of either the Pope or the [[archbishop]].&lt;ref name=Barber2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barber |first1=Malcolm|year=1973 |title=Propaganda in the Middle Ages |journal=Nottingham Mediæval Studies |volume=17 |issue= |pages=42–57 |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegedly through torture and terror, Konrad reported he had uncovered a satanic cult which worshiped devils in the forms of a demonic man and of a diabolical black cat.&lt;ref name=Engels&gt;{{cite book |last=Engles |first=Donald W. |editor-first= |editor-last=|title=Classical Cats: The Rise and Fall of the Sacred Cat |publisher= Routledge|date=2001|page=183 |chapter=Appendix III: Pope Gregory and the ''Vox in Rama'' |isbn= 0415261627}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inquisition of Konrad was controversial: shortly after Konrad arrived in Mainz, a papal official called Bernard wrote to Gregory stating that Konrad had been forcing innocent people to confess by threatening them with burning at the stake if they refused to do so.&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell|first=Jeffery Burton |title= Witchcraft in the Middle Ages |publisher=Cornell University Press|date=1984 |page=160 |chapter=Antinomianism, Scholasticism, and the Inquisition |isbn= 0801492890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Konrad was assassinated, possibly by the servants of [[Henry II, Count of Sayn]], whom Konrad had accused of fostering heresy.

The issue of the bull was a response to Konrad's allegations, urging Siegfried III and King Henry, representing the ecclesiastical and temporal authorities respectively, to seek out and destroy the heretics.&lt;ref name=Barber2 /&gt;

==Contents==

The bull describes in detail the initiation rites of the sect, claiming that the potential initiate is first approached by a mysterious [[toad]] as large as a dog.&lt;ref name=Lambert&gt;{{cite book |last=Lambert|first=Malcolm D. |title=The Cathars|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=1998 |pages=|chapter= |isbn= 063120959X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards an emaciated pale man would appear, whom the initiate would kiss and thereby forget all memory of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=Russell /&gt; Members of the sect would then meet for a meal.&lt;ref name=Lambert /&gt; When the meal had ended, the sect would arise and a statue of a black cat would come to life, walking backwards with its tail erect.&lt;ref name=Barber1 /&gt; First the new initiate and then the master of the sect would kiss the cat on the buttocks.&lt;ref name=Barber2 /&gt;

After the ritual was completed, the bull claims that the candles in the room would be extinguished and the sect would engage in wild orgies which were sometimes homosexual in nature. Once the candles are re-lit, a man from a dark corner of the room “comes forth from the loins upward, shining like the sun. His lower part is shaggy like a cat.” After a brief [[litany]]-like dialogue between the cat and the cult members, the meeting ends.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Rodenberg, ''Epistolae saeculi XIII e regestis pontificum Romanorum selectae'', MGH, Berlin, Weidmann, 1883, p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory also claims that the sect committed various [[Host desecration|crimes against the Eucharist]]:

{{Quote|text=They even receive the body of the Lord every year at [[Easter]] from the hand of the priest and, carrying it in their mouths home, they throw it into the latrine in contempt of the Saviour.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Rodenberg, ''Epistolae saeculi XIII e regestis pontificum Romanorum selectae'', MGH, Berlin, Weidmann, 1883, p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In conclusion, Gregory condemns the practice and calls upon the religious and secular authorities in the [[diocese]] to take action against the cult's participants.&lt;ref name=Lambert /&gt;
