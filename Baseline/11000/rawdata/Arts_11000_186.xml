[[File:Triptyque du vagabond (reconstitution).jpg|thumb|right|A reconstruction of the left and right wings of the triptych: at upper left ''[[Ship of Fools (painting)|The Ship of Fools]]''; at lower left: ''Allegory of Gluttony and Lust''. Panel at right is ''Death and the Miser''. At bottom "The Wayfarer" which  would have been on the outside of the triptych.]]


'''''Allegory of Intemperance''''' is a [[Hieronymus Bosch]] painting made sometime between 1490 and 1500. It is currently in the [[Yale University Art Gallery]] in [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hieronymus-bosch.org/Allegory-of-Gluttony-and-Lust.html|title=Allegory of Gluttony and Lust - Hieronymous Bosch|accessdate=11 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100419003453/http://www.hieronymus-bosch.org/Allegory-of-Gluttony-and-Lust.html| archivedate= 19 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This panel is the left inside bottom wing of a hinged triptych. The other identified parts are [[Ship of Fools (painting)|''The Ship of Fools'']], which formed the upper left panel,  and the ''[[Death and the Miser]]'', which was the right panel; ''[[The Wayfarer]]'' was painted on the right panel rear. The central panel, if existed, is unknown.

The ''Allegory'' represented a condemnation of gluttony, in the same way the right panel condemned avarice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/allegory-intemperance |title=Page at the museum's official website |access-date=2014-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917021840/http://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/allegory-intemperance |archive-date=2014-09-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fragment shows a fat man riding a barrel in a kind of lake or pool. He is surrounded by other people, who push him or pour a liquid from the barrel.  Below, a man swims with, above his head, a vessel with meat. The swimmer's clothes lie on the shore at bottom. On the right, under a hut, a couple is devoting to lascivious acts, perhaps induced by drunkenness.

It is closely modelled after the [[royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version.

The [[maple leaves]] in the shield, [[blazon]]ed "proper", were originally drawn [[Vert (heraldry)|vert]] (green) but were redrawn [[gules]] (red) in 1957 and a circlet of the [[Order of Canada]] was added to the arms for limited use in 1987. The shield design forms the [[Royal standards of Canada#Sovereign's standard|monarch's royal standard]] and is also found on the [[Canadian Red Ensign]]. The [[Flag of the Governor General of Canada]], which formerly used the shield over the [[Union Flag]], now uses the [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the arms on a blue field.

The arms are embossed on the cover of any [[Canadian nationality law|citizen]]'s [[Canadian passport]], in order to legally signify and symbolize that the bearer is travelling under the aid of the [[The Crown#Concept|Crown of Canada]].

A shield of arms first quartered and then, over time, as more provinces and territories joined Canada, marshalled with the arms of the new members of Confederation emerged through popular and even Canadian governmental usage.  This eventually resulted in a shield with nine quarterings, an arrangement that had never been approved by the monarch.&lt;ref name=RHSC/&gt;

Nine quarterings on a shield was considered too complex&lt;ref name=RHSC/&gt; for a national symbol and by 1915 a push had begun to design a new coat of arms for Canada.&lt;ref name=fraser2&gt;{{cite book|last=Fraser|first=Alistair B|title=The Flags of Canada|date=30 January 1998|chapter=Chapter I, Canada's National Symbols|url=http://fraser.cc/FlagsCan/index.html|chapterurl=http://fraser.cc/FlagsCan/Nation/NatSym.html|accessdate=1 October 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080915061016/http://fraser.cc/FlagsCan/index.html| archivedate=15 September 2008| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A committee was formed in 1919 to pursue the issue, eventually agreeing that the elements of the new arms would reference the Royal Arms of England, Ireland, Scotland, and France, with maple leaves representing Canada, though there was at the time no consensus on how the leaves were to be used.&lt;ref name=fraser2/&gt; The decision was settled by 1920, and the committee conferred with the [[College of Arms]] in London, only to face resistance to the use of the Royal Arms from the [[Garter King of Arms]].&lt;ref name=fraser2/&gt; After some manoeuvring, including the personal intervention of [[Winston Churchill]], the new arms of Canada were eventually formally requested by an [[Order in Council]] on 30 April 1921 and adopted on 21 November of the same year by proclamation of King [[George V]] as the Arms or Ensigns Armorial of the Dominion of Canada.&lt;ref name=proclamation&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/arm1_e.cfm |title=Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Promotion – The arms of Canada |publisher=Canadian Heritage |date=23 June 2008 |accessdate=21 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924075037/http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/arm1_e.cfm|archivedate=24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="London Gazette 1921 Proclamation"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32525|page=9242|date=22 November 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new layout closely reflected the arms of the United Kingdom&lt;ref name=description&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/arm2_e.cfm |title=Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Promotion – The arms of Canada (page 2)|publisher=Canadian Heritage |date=23 June 2008 |accessdate=21 November 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924072609/http://www.pch.gc.ca/PROGS/CPSC-CCSP/sc-cs/arm2_e.cfm |archivedate=24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the addition of maple leaves in the base and the reference to the French royal arms in the fourth quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/symboles-histoire-symbols-stories/symbole_canada_symbols-eng.pdf|title=Symbols of Canada|year=2008|publisher=Canadian Heritage|accessdate=20 November 2008|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proclamation also established white and red as the [[national colours of Canada]].

In 1931, with the passage of the Statute of Westminster, Canada and other Dominions became fully sovereign from the United Kingdom. This had the effect of elevating the Canadian coat of arms, which had been granted as deputed arms for particular uses in a colony, to the status of the royal arms of the King in right of the country, for general purposes throughout the country. They thus replaced the British coat of arms, which had previously been arms of general purpose throughout the British Empire, in court rooms and on government buildings to represent the ruling monarch. This change can be seen in the Great Seal of Canada of George VI, where the royal arms of Canada replaced the British arms, and is even more evident in the Great Seal of Canada for [[Elizabeth II]], where the title has been redefined as ''Queen of Canada''.&lt;ref name=Swann&gt;{{cite book|last=Swann|first=Conrad|title=Canada Symbols of Sovereignty: An investigation of the arms and seals borne from the earliest times to the present in connection with public authority in and over Canada. along with consideration of some connected flags|chapter=Chapter I, Arms of dominion and sovereignty and public authority|location=Toronto|publisher= University of Toronto Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the coat of arms of the Queen of Canada.

By 1957, the arms were redrawn by [[Alan Beddoe]] so as to have red leaves and to change the royal crown from one of a Tudor design to one more resembling [[St. Edward's Crown]], as preferred by Queen Elizabeth II.&lt;ref name=RHSC/&gt; To mark the 1982 [[patriation]] of the Canadian constitution, which finally ended the last vestiges of British authority over Canada, a [[McGill University]] student named Bruce Hicks proposed to [[Secretary of State (Canada)|Secretary of State]] [[Gerald Regan]] that the motto of the [[Order of Canada]] be placed around the shield in order to bring these royal arms into line with other royal arms, many of which have been displayed in Canada during French, Scottish, and English colonisation, where those countries' highest national order of honour appears around the shield of the arms (the British arms displayed the [[Order of the Garter]], the Scottish [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|royal arms]] the [[Order of the Thistle]], and the royalist [[National Emblem of France|arms of the French Regime]] the [[Order of the Holy Spirit]] and [[Order of Saint Michael]]).&lt;ref name=Hicks&gt;{{cite book|last=Hicks|first=Bruce|title=The Campaign to Change the Royal Arms of Canada (Hogtown Heraldry 12:4)}}&lt;/ref&gt; While unsuccessful in this first attempt, Hicks continued his campaign and was joined by a number of other amateur and professional heraldists. As a journalist in the parliamentary press gallery in Ottawa in the late 1980s and early 90s, Hicks strategically recast the change as something worth doing to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Order of Canada in 1992, an idea that was endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the Order of Canada.&lt;ref name=McCreery&gt;{{cite book|last=McCreery|first=Christopher|title=The Order of Canada: Its Origins, History and Development|isbn=0-8020-3940-5|location=Toronto|publisher=University of Toronto Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It took until 1994 for the Queen to approve the new design for general use, though the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] began to allow for its limited use beginning in 1987, where the arms were used to represent the Queen personally on letters patent granting new arms for distinguished Canadians.&lt;ref name=hansard/&gt; These letters patent carried the shield from the royal arms along with the annulus behind the shield bearing the motto of the [[Order of Canada]]—''Desiderantes meliorem patriam''. As soon as royal approval was forthcoming, the full achievement was redesigned for use by the federal government within the [[Federal Identity Program]].&lt;ref name=RHSC/&gt; The present design of the arms of Canada was drawn by [[Cathy Bursey-Sabourin]], Fraser Herald at the Canadian Heraldic Authority.&lt;ref name=Poster&gt;{{cite book|last=Canadian Heritage|title=The Arms of Canada (Ottawa: Government of Canada)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, Member of Parliament [[Pat Martin]] introduced a [[Motion (democracy)|motion]] into the [[House of Commons of Canada]] calling on the government to amend the coat of arms to incorporate symbols representing Canada's [[First Nations]], [[Inuit]], and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/coat-of-arms-ignores-aboriginal-people-mp-says-1.748913 |title=Coat of arms ignores aboriginal people, MP say |date=20 June 2008 |publisher=CBC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622224734/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2008/06/20/coat-arms.html |archive-date=22 June 2008 |dead-url=no |access-date=20 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| The [[motto]] of Canada is in Latin ''a mari usque ad mare'' (From sea to sea), a part of [[Psalms|Psalm]] 72:8.&lt;ref name=canenc1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/a-mari-usque-ad-mare/ |title=A Mari usque ad Mare |last=Lamb |first=W.

==Review==
{{quote|From a sleekly modern apartment house in Cairo to a town hall in the Netherlands, architecture was influenced internationally by the Art Deco style, as revealed by this wide-angled, superbly illustrated survey. Bayer (The Art of Rene Lalique) first uncovers Art Deco's ancient and exotic sources, from Assyrian to Mayan to Moorish. Her text, wedded to 376 jazzy, snazzy illustrations (146 in color), demonstrates how this vibrant, decorative style extended between the wars into every nook and cranny of the U.S. leaving its mark on skyscrapers, movie theaters, firehouses, factories, dams, tunnels, high schools, gas stations, roadside diners and even gravestones. Bayer also examines the Art Deco revival, citing restored Miami Beach hotels as well as public buildings by [[Michael Graves]], [[Robert Venturi]] and [[Helmut Jahn]] that echo or evoke Art Deco, a style "at once traditional and innovative."}}

The '''Basilica of the Holy Blood''' ({{lang-nl|Heilig-Bloedbasiliek}}, {{lang-fr|Basilique du Saint-Sang}}) is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[basilica]] in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]]. The church houses a venerated relic of the [[Blood of Christ|Holy Blood]] allegedly collected by [[Joseph of Arimathea]] and brought from the [[Holy Land]] by [[Thierry of Alsace]], [[Count of Flanders]]. Built between 1134 and 1157 as the [[chapel]] of the [[Count of Flanders]], it was promoted to a [[minor basilica]] in 1923.

The basilica in Burg square consists of a lower and upper chapel. The lower chapel, dedicated to [[St. Basil the Great]], is a dark [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] structure that remains virtually unchanged. The venerated relic is in the upper chapel, which was rebuilt in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style in the 16th century and renovated in the 19th century in [[Gothic Revival]] style.

== History ==
In 1134, Thierry of Alsace decided to build a private double chapel next to the ''{{lang|nl|Oud Steen}}'', the first residence of the Counts of Flanders, transformed today into the [[town hall]] of Bruges. Thierry went on crusade a second time in 1147 during the [[Second Crusade]]. According to the tradition, Thierry of Alsace returned to his capital Bruges on April 7, 1150, with the relic of the [[Blood of Christ|Precious Blood]]. During the first half of the 13th century, the name of the upper chapel was changed to the Chapel of the Holy Blood.&lt;ref name="gids"/&gt;

== St Basil chapel ==

[[File:Bruges - Holy Blood church.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Romanesque St Basil chapel]]
The chapel of Saint Basil is one of the best preserved churches in Romanesque style of [[West-Flanders]].&lt;ref name="gids" /&gt; Built from 1134 to 1149, the chapel is dedicated to [[St. Basil the Great]] of whom a relic was brought back by Count [[Robert II, Count of Flanders|Robert II]] from [[Caesarea Mazaca]] in [[Cappadocia]], [[Asia Minor]] (modern-day [[Turkey]]).

The chapel consists of two side naves and a central nave continued by the choir, which in turn is ended by a semi-circular [[apse]]. In the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] above the entrance linking the chapel and the annex is a 12th-century representation of the baptism of Saint Basil. In the right nave, the ''seated Madonna and Child'' (''[[Sedes Sapientiae]]'') is a wooden polychrome sculpture of the early 14th century. Carried each year during the procession, two venerated wooden statues, made around 1900 and representing ''Jesus on the Cold Stone'' and the ''Pieta'' are displayed.

At the left of the choir, the chapel of Saint Yves was added in 1504 and houses the relics of Saint Basil and of Blessed [[Charles the Good]], Count of Flanders. The black marble retable is allegedly executed from designs by [[Lancelot Blondeel]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

== Chapel of the Holy Blood ==

Originally built in Romanesque style like the St Basil chapel, the upper chapel was transformed in Gothic Style at the end of the 15th century and again in 1823. Only the curved arches giving access to the side chapel of the Holy Cross remain from the original Romanesque chapel.
[[File:Main altar of the Basilica of the Holy Blood.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Main altar of the Basilica of the Holy Blood.]]

The monumental staircase, commonly named ''{{lang|nl|De Steegheere}}'', which leads to the upper chapel, was built in from 1529 to 1533 in late Gothic and Renaissance style according to the drawings of Flemish painter and architect [[Lancelot Blondeel|William Aerts]],&lt;ref name="gids" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weale|first=W. H. James|year=1908|title=Lancelot Blondeel-I|journal=[[The Burlington Magazine|The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs]]|volume=14|issue=68|pages=96–101|issn=0007-6287}}&lt;/ref&gt; ornamented on the outside with sculpted statues. The aftermath of the French Revolution left the staircase badly damaged and it was decided in 1832 to move it {{convert|4|m}} backwards and to rebuild it after removing the remaining ruins of the ''Oud Steen''.&lt;ref name="gids" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It is considered to be the first artistic renovation carried out by the recently created [[Belgium|Belgian State]].&lt;/ref&gt; The gilded bronze statues represent Archduchess [[Isabelle of Burgundy]], [[Mary of Burgundy]], Thierry of Alsace and [[Philip of Alsace]] and, in the medallions, the Archdukes of Austria [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert VII]] and [[Maximilian III of Austria|Maximilian III]], [[Margaret of York]] and [[Sibylla of Anjou]], wife of Thierry and daughter of King [[Fulk of Jerusalem]].

During the 19th century, successive renovation campaigns gave to the chapel its final [[Gothic Revival]] aspect, with its characteristic mural decorations. The stained-glass windows in the choir date from 1845&lt;ref&gt;The original stained-glass windows were removed after the [[French Revolution]]. Some of the original ones ended up in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.&lt;/ref&gt; and represent the sovereigns who reigned over the County of Flanders from [[Philip the Bold]], [[duke of Burgundy]], till Archduchess [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], [[Holy Roman emperor|Holy Roman empress]].

The following architects and artists took part in these [[neo-Gothic]] renovations of the Chapel of the Holy Blood:&lt;ref name="gids" /&gt;
* [[Jean-Baptiste Bethune (architect)|Jean-Baptiste Bethune]]
* [[Louis Delacenserie]]
* [[Thomas Harper King]]
* [[William Curtis Brangwyn]], father of [[Frank Brangwyn]]
* [[Charles De Wulf]], architect of the city of Bruges and winner of the [[Prix de Rome]] in 1887&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charles De Wulf |url=http://archief.oostende.be/product/91/default.aspx?_vs=0_N&amp;id=5078 |publisher=Stad Oostende - Stadsarchief |location=Oostende |language=Dutch |accessdate=16 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090531064237/http://archief.oostende.be/product/91/default.aspx?_vs=0_N&amp;id=5078| archivedate= 31 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pulpit in the form of a globe dates was made in 1728 by [[Henry Pulinckx]], inspired by its evangelical purpose : "''Go into all the world and preach the gospel''" {{bibleverse||Mark|16:15|NIV|}}.

The large wall-painting behind the high altar was realized in 1905. In the upper part, the ''Mystery of the Cross'' depicts Christ shedding his blood, with, in the background, the towns of Bethlehem, where Christ was born, and Jerusalem where he died. The lower part depicts the transport of the relic from Jerusalem to Bruges: on the left, Thierry of Alsace receives the relic from [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]], King of Jerusalem ; on the right, kneeling besides Countess [[Sibylla of Anjou]], he hands over the relic to the chaplain.

The high altar used today for the Eucharist is decorated with a relief in alabaster from the beginning of the 17th century depicting the Last Supper. Typical attributes of a basilica, the [[tintinnabulum]], the small processional bell, and the [[Umbraculum]], the sunscreen in the form of a parasol in yellow and red silk, are displayed next to the high altar.

[[Laurent Delvaux]] completed in 1751 the white marble altar in Baroque style for the relic side chapel. The two adoring angels were made by [[Peter Pepers]]. The relic is kept in a magnificent silver tabernacle made by local silversmith François Ryelandt (1709–1774), representing the "[[Lamb of Christ]]". To the right of the altar, the painting of [[Jacob van Oost]] depicts the descent from the Cross.  The relic is shown to the public every Friday and every day two weeks before Ascension Day.

== Relic of the Precious Blood ==
[[File:The Blood Relic.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Relic of the [[Blood of Christ|Holy Blood]], [[Bruges]].]]

The basilica is best known as the repository of a venerated [[phial]] said to contain a cloth with blood of [[Jesus Christ]], brought to the city by Thierry of Alsace after the 12th century [[Second Crusade]].&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vinc" /&gt;

Although the Bible never mentions Christ's blood being preserved, one of the [[apocryphal gospels]] asserts that [[Joseph of Arimathea]] preserved the [[Precious Blood]] after he had washed the dead body of Christ. The daily making present of the [[Blood of Christ]] during the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] was central in the religious life of the [[Middle Age]] in Europe. If genuine, a relic of the Blood of Jesus would be of utmost significance, a uniquely important witness to Jesus’ Passion and a perpetual reminder of the historical character of the Christian Gospel.&lt;ref name="Vinc" /&gt;

Popular legend asserts that the phial was taken to Bruges during the [[Second Crusade]] of [[Common Era|CE]] 1147–1149, by Thierry of Alsace, who returned from Jerusalem with the relic of the [[Blood of Christ|Holy Blood]] presented to him by his brother-in-law [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]], as the reward of his great services.&lt;ref name="Nick"&gt;{{cite book | last = Nickell | first = Joe | title = Relics of the Christ | chapter=Blood of Jesus|publisher = University Press of Kentucky | location = Lexington | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-8131-2425-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A9sj9XmdmekC&amp;pg=PA169|pages=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, recent research found no evidences of the presence of the relic in Bruges before the 1250s.&lt;ref name="Vinc"/&gt; In all likelihood, the relic originated from the 1204 [[sack of Constantinople]] by the army of the [[Counts of Flanders|Count of Flanders]], [[Baldwin I of Constantinople|Baldwin IX]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]].&lt;ref name="Vinc"&gt;{{cite book | last = Vincent | first = Nicholas | title = The Holy Blood: King Henry III and the Westminster Blood relic | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | location = Cambridge | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-521-57128-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H8F28cKVdwAC&amp;pg=PA73|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since, the phial has played no small part in the religious life of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy| wstitle=Bruges| title =Bruges| first = Cyril| last = J.| authorlink = | accessdate =2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Clement V]] issued a [[papal bull]] in 1310 granting [[indulgences]] to pilgrims who visited the chapel to view the relic.

Recent investigations have showed that the phial, made of rock crystal and dating back to the 11th or 12th century,&lt;ref name="Nick"/&gt; was a Byzantine perfume bottle made in the area of [[Constantinople]]. It was never opened since its arrival in Bruges. Its neck is wound with gold thread and its stopper is sealed with red wax. The phial is encased in a glass-fronted gold cylinder closed at each end by [[coronets]] decorated with angels. The date "''MCCCLXXXVIII die III maii''" (May 3, 1388) is engraved on the frame.&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt;

== Procession of the Holy Blood ==
{{main article|Procession of the Holy Blood}}

The reliquary used during the procession is displayed in the Basilica Museum. The shrine was made in 1617 in Bruges by [[goldsmith]] [[Jan Crabbe]] from some {{convert|30|kg|lb}} of gold and silver and more than 100 precious stones. It consists of a gem-encrusted hexagonal case topped by golden statues representing Jesus-Christ, The [[Virgin Mary]], [[Saint Donatian|St. Donatian]] and [[St. Basil the Great]].

==Jeu du Saint Sang==
''Jeu du Saint Sang'' is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[passion play]], performed in [[Bruges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotelara.com/belgium/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120905073629/http://www.hotelara.com/belgium/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-05 |title=Belgium travel guide |publisher=Hotelara |date= |accessdate=2013-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in 1938, and translated into French by [[Émile Schwartz]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Boon, ''Sanguis Christi, Le jeu du Saint Sang de Bruges'', in three acts and a prologue, French translation Émile Schwartz, éd. Renouveau « La Source », Bruxelles, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
In the 2008 movie ''[[In Bruges]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0780536|Memorable quotes for [[In Bruges]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Ken pays a visit to the relic of the Holy Blood.  However, the privately owned Church of Jerusalem ({{lang-nl|Jerusalemkerk}})—built in the 15th century according to the plans of the [[Holy Sepulcher]] in Jerusalem—was used instead of the Basilica.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3855">[[File:3x5 Basket Weave Knot.png|thumb|right|350px|A diagram of a basket weave knot on a 3x5 rectangular grid]]
The '''basket weave knots''' are a family of [[bend (knot)|bend]] and [[lanyard]] [[knot]]s with a regular pattern of over–one, under–one. All of these knots are rectangular and lie in a plane.&lt;ref name="ashley1"&gt;{{cite book |last= Ashley |first= Charles |title= The Ashley Book of Knots |pages= 139–140}}{{full|date=June 2014|reason=year, etc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are named after [[braid|plait]]-woven [[basket weaving|baskets]], which have a similar appearance.

==Construction==
[[File:2x5 Basket Weave Knot.png|thumb|left|A diagram of a long basket weave knot on a 2x5 grid]]
A basket weave knot is made up of two sets of parallel lines drawn inside a rectangle such that the lines meet at the edges of the rectangle. For a true basket weave knot that can be tied with two strands, the number of intersections in each direction cannot have a common [[divisor]]. Within this constraint, there is no theoretical upper limit to the size of a basket weave knot.&lt;ref name="ashley1"/&gt; Thus, a knot that has two intersections in one direction can be lengthened with any odd number in the perpendicular direction. If the dimension ''n'' in the smaller direction is odd, it is always possible to construct a knot with ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 intersections in the other dimension. However, large basket weave knots have a tendency to twist and curl because they are completely flat.&lt;ref name="ashley1"/&gt;

A basket weave knot can be tied from a single strand by first forming a [[bight (knot)|bight]] in the middle of the line. The ends near the bight become the standing ends. This method will keep the knot in one plane only for knots in which the standing ends enter the same side; these knots are called ''[[bosun]]'s knots'' because they can be tied in a lanyard.&lt;ref name="ashley1"/&gt; For knots in which the standing ends enter from different sides of the rectangle, the bight will wrap across one side of the knot after it is set.

Any basket weave knot that can be tied from two strands can be drawn as an [[endless knot]] by connecting the standing ends together and the working ends together.  An example of this can be seen in the [[carrick mat]].

[[File:Gosforth Cross Víðarr.jpg|right|thumb|A decorative use on the [[Gosforth Cross]], from the 10th century AD]]
If a basket weave knot is tied with a flat line such as ribbon instead of a round line such as rope or cord, the method of turning the line at the edges affects the final appearance. Deflecting the line will form a series of bights or scallops along the edge, while folding it over will leave the edge flat.&lt;ref name="ashley2"&gt;Ashley, pp. 148-149&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:Carrick bend with basket weave grid.jpg|thumb|right|A [[carrick bend]] knot with a 2x3 rectangular grid superimposed upon it]]
The simplest basket weave knots consist of a two–by–three rectangle of intersections and include the following:

*[[Carrick bend]]
*[[Double coin knot]]
*[[Sheet bend]]
*[[Reef knot]]
*[[Granny knot]]

In the reef knot and granny knot, the standing ends enter the short side, while in the double coin knot and the sheet bend, the standing ends enter the long side. Therefore, any of these knots could be used for a lanyard. In the carrick bend, which is otherwise similar to the double coin knot, the standing ends enter opposite long sides.

The next smallest possible basket weave knot is made up of a three–by–four rectangle, and may be called a [[boatswain]]'s lanyard, whistle lanyard, [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] knot, or Chinese knot,&lt;ref name="ashley2"/&gt; although the art of [[Chinese knotting]] includes many more knots besides this one.

&lt;/ref&gt; Tilley is the author of a biography of the Australian performer [[Leigh Bowery]] titled ''Leigh Bowery, The Life and Times of an Icon''. Tilley was introduced to Freud by Bowery, who was already modelling for him. Freud painted a number of large portraits of her around the period 1994&amp;ndash;96, and came to call her "Big Sue". He said of her body "It's flesh without muscle and it has developed a different kind of texture through bearing such a weight-bearing thing".&lt;ref&gt;[[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]], Exhibition booklet for ''Lucian Freud Portraits'', 2012, Section VII&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Botanical garden of Thutmose III''' ({{lang-fr|Jardin botanique de Thoutmôsis III}}) is an artistic representation of [[fauna]] and especially [[flora]] during the [[Egyptian empire]] at its peak. The remarkably detailed reliefs are located on the walls of the room next to the [[Festival Hall of Thutmose III]], in the [[Precinct of Amun-Re]], [[Karnak]].&lt;ref name="Ratié1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ratié|first=Suzanne|title=La reine Hatchepsout: sources et problèmes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LWxZpn63tdMC&amp;pg=PA151|accessdate=25 November 2011|year=1979|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-06064-7|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; On land at the rear of the shrine, the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]] Pharaoh [[Thutmose III]] built the Festival Hall of Thutmose III, also known as the ''Akh-menu''. The walls were then used by royal artists who, by order of the [[pharaoh]], engraved in stone some of the most beautiful pastoral representations of Egypt.

Thutmose III, the great warrior pharaoh who expanded the boundaries of Egypt in the north and the south, collected a considerable collection of rare species of animals and lush plants. His animals and botanical collection are found engraved on the walls of the sanctuary. Through the royal artists, the pharaoh boasts of the scenic beauty, the lush flora and rich fauna he discovered during his victorious campaigns against Asiatics.

Past speakers include [[Marcel Wanders]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Raman Hui]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Tom Dixon (industrial designer)]], [[Jimmy Choo]], [[John William Sorrell|Sir John Sorrell]], [[Karim Rashid]], [[Bingham Willis]], [[Marc Newson]], and [[Vivienne Tam]].

Each year, BODW forms a partnership with a different country. The country is invited to bring a group of designers to Hong Kong to give presentations at the conference. The country can also hold exhibitions and seminars about its national design. The partner country for 2008 was the [[Netherlands]] and for 2006 and 2007 was the [[UK]] and [[Italy]] respectively.

BODW has main events which occur each year including the BODW Forum where designers give presentations. There is also the HKDC Award Gala Dinner where the [[HKDC Awards]] are presented. These awards include the Design for Asia Awards, the World’s Outstanding Chinese Designer Award, the Design Leadership Award, the Design for Asia Award, and the Hong Kong Young Design Talent Awards.

[[Image:Beerbohm-Beardsley.jpg|thumb|Caricature of [[Aubrey Beardsley]] by [[Max Beerbohm]] (1896), taken from ''[[Caricatures of Twenty-five Gentlemen]]'']]
A '''caricature''' is a [[artistic rendering|rendered]] image showing the features of its subject in a simplified or exaggerated way through sketching, pencil strokes, or through other artistic drawings.

In literature, a '''caricature''' is a description of a person using [[exaggeration]] of some characteristics and oversimplification of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://contemporarylit.about.com/cs/literaryterms/g/caricature.htm |title=Caricature in literature |publisher=Contemporarylit.about.com |date=2012-04-10 |accessdate=2013-01-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112213435/http://contemporarylit.about.com/cs/literaryterms/g/caricature.htm |archivedate=2013-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caricatures can be insulting or complimentary and can serve a political purpose or be drawn solely for entertainment.  Caricatures of politicians are commonly used in [[editorial cartoon]]s, while caricatures of movie stars are often found in entertainment [[magazine]]s.

== Etymology ==
The term is derived from the Italian ''caricare''—to charge or load. An early definition occurs in the English doctor [[Thomas Browne]]'s ''[[Christian Morals]]'', published posthumously in 1716.

{{quote|Expose not thy self by four-footed manners unto monstrous draughts, and Caricatura representations.}}

with the footnote:

{{quote|When Men's faces are drawn with resemblance to some other Animals, the Italians call it, to be drawn in Caricatura}}

Thus, the word "caricature" essentially means a "loaded portrait". Until the mid 19th century, it was commonly and mistakenly believed that the term shared the same root as the French 'charcuterie', likely owing to Parisian street artists using cured meats in their satirical portrayal of public figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lynch |first=John |date=1926 |title=A History of Caricature |location=London |publisher=Faber &amp; Dwyer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Graffiti politique de Pompei.jpg|thumb|Ancient [[Pompeii]]an graffiti caricature of a politician.]]
Some of the earliest caricatures are found in the works of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who actively sought people with deformities to use as models. The point was to offer an impression of the original which was more striking than a portrait.

Caricature took a road to its first successes in the closed [[aristocratic]] circles of France and Italy, where such portraits could be passed about for mutual enjoyment.

[[Image:Caricature gillray plumpudding.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Gillray]]'s ''[[The Plumb-pudding in danger]]'' (1805),  which caricatured [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] and [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]], was voted the most famous of all UK political cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Br J Rev |year=2006 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=59–64 |author= Preston O |title= Cartoons... at last a big draw |doi=10.1177/0956474806064768}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

While the first book on caricature drawing to be published in England was [[Mary and Matthew Darly|Mary Darly's]] ''A Book of Caricaturas'' (c. 1762), the first known North American caricatures were drawn in 1759 during the battle for Quebec.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;Mosher, Terry. "Drawn and Quartered." Leader and Dreamers Commemorative Issue. Maclean's. 2004: 171. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  These caricatures were the work of [[George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend|Brig.-Gen. George Townshend]] whose caricatures of [[James Wolfe|British General James Wolfe]], depicted as "Deformed and crass and hideous" (Snell),&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; were drawn to amuse fellow officers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; Elsewhere, two great practitioners of the art of caricature in 18th-century Britain were [[Thomas Rowlandson]] (1756–1827) and [[James Gillray]] (1757–1815). Rowlandson was more of an artist and his work took its inspiration mostly from the public at large.  Gillray was more concerned with the vicious visual satirisation of political life.  They were, however, great friends and caroused together in the pubs of London.&lt;ref&gt;See the Tate Gallery's exhibit [http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/james-gillray-art-caricature/james-gillray-art-caricature-politics "James Gillray: The Art of Caricature"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729132041/http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/james-gillray-art-caricature/james-gillray-art-caricature-politics |date=2014-07-29 }}. Accessed July 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In a lecture titled ''The History and Art of Caricature'', the British caricaturist Ted Harrison said that the caricaturist can choose to either mock or wound the subject with an effective caricature.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Harrison lecture, ''The History and Art of Caricature'', September 2007, Queen Mary 2 Lecture Theatre&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing caricatures can simply be a form of entertainment and amusement – in which case gentle mockery is in order – or the art can be employed to make a serious social or political point.  A caricaturist draws on (1) the natural characteristics of the subject (the big ears, long nose, etc.); (2) the acquired characteristics (stoop, scars, facial lines etc.); and (3) the vanities (choice of hair style, spectacles, clothes, expressions, and mannerisms).

* '''[[Max Beerbohm|Sir Max Beerbohm]]''' (1872–1956, British), created and published caricatures of the famous men of his own time and earlier.  His style of single-figure caricatures in formalized groupings was established by 1896 and flourished until about 1930.  His published works include ''[[Caricatures of Twenty-five Gentlemen]]'' (1896), ''[[The Poets' Corner]]'' (1904), and ''[[Rossetti and His Circle]]'' (1922).  He published widely in fashionable magazines of the time, and his works were exhibited regularly in London at the Carfax Gallery (1901–18) and [[Leicester Galleries]] (1911–57).
* '''[[George Cruikshank]]''' (1792–1878, British) created political prints that attacked the royal family and leading politicians. He went on to create social caricatures of British life for popular publications such as ''The Comic Almanack'' (1835–1853) and ''Omnibus'' (1842). Cruikshanks' ''New Union Club'' of 1819 is notable in the context of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;''The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed Elizabeth Mcgrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute)2012&lt;/ref&gt; He also earned fame as a book illustrator for [[Charles Dickens]] and many other authors.
* '''[[Honoré Daumier]]''' (1808–1879, French) created over 4,000 lithographs, most of them caricatures on political, social, and everyday themes.  They were published in the daily French newspapers (''[[Le Charivari]]'', ''[[La Caricature (1830–1843)|La Caricature]]'' etc.)
* '''[[Mort Drucker]]''' (1929-, American) joined ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' in 1957 and became well known for his parodies of [[film|movie]] satires. He combined a [[comic strip]] style with caricature likenesses of film actors for ''Md'', and he also contributed covers to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. He has been recognized for his work with the [[National Cartoonists Society]] Special Features Award for 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988, and their [[Reuben Award]] for 1987.
* '''[[Alex Gard]]''' (1900–1948, Russian) created more than 700 caricatures of show business celebrities and other notables for the walls of [[Sardi's|Sardi's Restaurant]] in the theater district of New York City: the first artist to do so.  Today the images are part of the Billy Rose Theatre Collection of [[New York Public Library|The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/research/manuscripts/the/thesardis.xml NYPL.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210150138/http://nypl.org/research/manuscripts/the/thesardis.xml |date=2009-02-10 }}, the New York Public Library Inventory of the Sardi's caricatures, 1925–1952.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Al Hirschfeld]]''' (1903–2003, American) was best known for his simple black and white renditions of celebrities and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stars which used flowing contour lines over heavy rendering.  He was also known for depicting a variety of other famous people, from politicians, musicians, singers and even television stars like the cast of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''.  He was even commissioned by the [[United States Postal Service]] to provide art for U.S. stamps.  Permanent collections of Hirschfeld's work appear at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, and he boasts a star on the [[St. Louis Walk of Fame]].
* '''[[S. Jithesh]]''' is known for his speedy style of [[Celebrity]] Caricaturing Stage Shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yentha.com/news/view/features/teaching%20history%20with%20a%20few%20squiggles |title=Teaching History With A Few Squiggles - Trivandrum News |publisher=Yentha.com |date=2011-11-17 |accessdate=2013-01-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029141035/http://www.yentha.com/news/view/features/teaching%20history%20with%20a%20few%20squiggles |archivedate=2012-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/02/28/stories/2010022851350300.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Cartoons take shape in no time | date=February 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He performs a 'Caricature Stage Show' which is a blend of [[poetry]], [[anecdotes]] and socio-political [[satire]] and caricature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/article812347.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=‘Varayarangu' reaches a milestone | date=October 4, 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112212637/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/article812347.ece | archivedate=November 12, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Sebastian Krüger]]''' (1963, [[German people|German]]) is known for his grotesque, yet [[Hyperreality|hyper-realistic]] distortions of the facial features of celebrities, which he renders primarily in [[acrylic paint]], and for which he has won praise from ''[[The Times]]''.  He is well known for his lifelike depictions of [[The Rolling Stones]], in particular, [[Keith Richards]].  Krüger has published three collections of his works, and has a yearly art calendar from Morpheus International.  Krüger's art can be seen frequently in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine and has also been featured in the likes of ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'', ''[[L’Espresso]]'', ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'', and ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' and ''[[USA Today]]''.  He has recently been working on select motion picture projects.
* '''[[David Levine]]''' (1926–2009, American) is noted for his caricatures in ''The New York Review of Books'' and ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine.  His first cartoons appeared in 1963.  Since then he has drawn hundreds of pen-and-ink caricatures of famous writers and politicians for the newspaper.
* '''[[Hermann Mejia]]'''  ([[Venezuela]]n) is known for his frequent work for ''[[Mad (magazine)|MAD Magazine]]''.  Mejia uses multiple techniques in his work, sometimes rendering his illustrations in black and white ink and copious amounts of [[cross-hatching]], sometimes using [[watercolor]], and sometimes combinations of both.
* '''[[Thomas Nast]]''' (1840–1902, American) was a famous caricaturist and editorial cartoonist in the 19th century and is considered by some as written in 1908 by ''[[The New York Times]]'' to be the father of American political cartooning. He is often credited with creating the definitive caricature of Santa Claus, and often mistakenly credited with creating the definitive caricatures of the Democratic Donkey and the Republican Elephant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* '''[[Sanford Ross]]''' (1907-1954, American) was recognized by New York critics for his lithographic caricatures of New Jersey mansions and civic buildings in the 1930s.
* '''[[Sam Viviano]]''' (1953, American) has done much work for corporations and in advertising, having contributed to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Family Weekly]]'', ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', ''[[Consumer Reports]]'', and ''[[MAD Magazine|Mad]]'', of which he is currently the [[art director]].  Viviano’s caricatures are known for their wide jaws, which Viviano has explained is a result of his incorporation of side views as well as front views into his distortions of the human face.  He has also developed a reputation for his ability to do crowd scenes.  Explaining his twice-yearly covers for ''Institutional Investor'' magazine, Viviano has said that his upper limit is sixty caricatures in nine days.

== Computerization ==
[[File:Caricature of Ammon Bundy.jpg|thumb|An example of a caricature created using computerized techniques, superimposed over a photographic image.]]
There have been some efforts to produce caricatures automatically or semi-automatically using computer graphics techniques. For example, a system proposed by Akleman et al.&lt;ref name="aklemancaricature"&gt;E. Akleman, J, Palmer, R. Logan, "Making Extreme Caricatures with a New Interactive 2D Deformation Technique with Simplicial Complexes", Proceedings of Visual 2000, pp. Mexico City, Mexico, pp. 165–170, September 2000.  See the author's examples on [http://www-viz.tamu.edu/faculty/ergun/research/artisticdepiction/caricature/morphing/presidents VIZ-tamu.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701095901/http://www-viz.tamu.edu/faculty/ergun/research/artisticdepiction/caricature/morphing/presidents |date=July 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; provides warping tools specifically designed toward rapidly producing caricatures.  There are very few software programs designed specifically for automatically creating caricatures.

Computer graphic system requires quite different skill sets to design a caricature as compared to the caricatures created on paper.  Thus using a computer in the digital production of caricatures requires advanced knowledge of the program's functionality.  Rather than being a simpler method of caricature creation, it can be a more complex method of creating images that feature finer coloring textures than can be created using more traditional methods.

A milestone in formally defining caricature was Susan Brennan's master's thesis&lt;ref name="brennanthesis"&gt;Susan Brennan, The Caricature Generator, MIT Media Lab master's thesis, 1982.  Also see {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1982.  In her system, caricature was formalized as the process of exaggerating differences from an average face.  For example, if [[Prince Charles]] has more prominent ears than the average person, in his caricature the ears will be much larger than normal.  Brennan's system implemented this idea in a partially automated fashion as follows:  the operator was required to input a frontal drawing of the desired person having a standardized topology (the number and ordering of lines for every face).  She obtained a corresponding drawing of an average male face.  Then, the particular face was caricatured simply by subtracting from the particular face the corresponding point on the mean face (the origin being placed in the middle of the face), scaling this difference by a factor larger than one, and adding the scaled difference back onto the mean face.

Though Brennan's formalization was introduced in the 1980s, it remains relevant in recent work.  Mo et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Mo|first=Z.|author2=Lewis, J.|author3=Neumann, U.|title=Improved Automatic Caricature by Feature Normalization and Exaggeration|booktitle=ACM Siggraph|year=2004|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1186294&amp;jmp=references&amp;coll=&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;CFID=15151515&amp;CFTOKEN=6184618 |doi=10.1145/1186223.1186294}}&lt;/ref&gt; refined the idea by noting that the population variance of the feature should be taken into account.  For example, the distance between the eyes varies less than other features such as the size of the nose.  Thus even a small variation in the eye spacing is unusual and should be exaggerated, whereas a correspondingly small change in the nose size relative to the mean would not be unusual enough to be worthy of exaggeration.

On the other hand, Liang et al.&lt;ref name="liangcaricature"&gt;L. Liang, H. Chen, Y. Xu, and H. Shum, Example-Based Caricature Generation with Exaggeration, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1167882 Pacific Graphics 2002].&lt;/ref&gt; argue that caricature varies depending on the artist and cannot be captured in a single definition.  Their system uses machine learning techniques to automatically learn and mimic the style of a particular caricature artist, given training data in the form of a number of face photographs and the corresponding caricatures by that artist.  The results produced by computer graphic systems are arguably not yet of the same quality as those produced by human artists.  For example, most systems are restricted to exactly frontal poses, whereas many or even most manually produced caricatures (and face portraits in general) choose an off-center "three-quarters" view.  Brennan's caricature drawings were frontal-pose line drawings.  More recent systems can produce caricatures in a variety of styles, including direct geometric distortion of photographs.

== Caricature advantage ==
Brennan's caricature generator was used to test recognition of caricatures. Rhodes, Brennan and Carey demonstrated that caricatures were recognised more accurately than the original images.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Identification and ratings of caricatures: Implications for mental representations of faces|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028587900168|journal = Cognitive Psychology|date = 1987-10-01|pages = 473–497|volume = 19|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/0010-0285(87)90016-8|first = Gillian|last = Rhodes|first2 = Susan|last2 = Brennan|first3 = Susan|last3 = Carey}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used line drawn images but Benson and Perrett showed similar effects with photographic quality images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Perception and recognition of photographic quality facial caricatures: Implications for the recognition of natural images|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09541449108406222|journal = European Journal of Cognitive Psychology|date = 1991-01-01|issn = 0954-1446|pages = 105–135|volume = 3|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/09541449108406222|first = Philip J.|last = Benson|first2 = David I.|last2 = Perrett}}&lt;/ref&gt; Explanations for this advantage have been based on both norm-based theories of face recognition&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and exemplar-based theories of face recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Understanding Caricatures of Faces|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/713755758|journal = The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology Section A|date = 1998-05-01|issn = 0272-4987|pmid = 9621842|pages = 321–346|volume = 51|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/713755758|first = Michael B.|last = Lewis|first2 = Robert A.|last2 = Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern use ==
[[File:MattCaric.jpg|thumb|A modern, street-style caricature, with the subject holding the picture for comparison]]

Beside the political and public-figure satire, most contemporary caricatures are used as gifts or souvenirs, often drawn by street vendors.  For a small fee, a caricature can be drawn specifically (and quickly) for a patron.  These are popular at street fairs, carnivals, and even weddings, often with humorous results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/16/street-portraits-gone-wro_n_614120.html#s101149 |title=Street Portraits Gone Wrong: The Funniest Caricature Drawings Ever (PICTURES) |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=June 16, 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-31 |first=Katla |last=McGlynn |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813192049/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/16/street-portraits-gone-wro_n_614120.html#s101149 |archivedate=August 13, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caricature artists are also popular attractions at many places frequented by tourists, especially oceanfront [[boardwalk]]s, where vacationers can have a humorous caricature sketched in a few minutes for a small fee.  Caricature artists can sometimes be hired for parties, where they will draw caricatures of the guests for their entertainment.

===Museums===
There are numerous museums dedicated to caricature throughout the world, including the [[Caricature Museum, Mexico City|''Museo de la Caricatura'']] of [[Mexico City]], the ''[[Museum of Caricature, Warsaw|Muzeum Karykatury]]'' in [[Warsaw]],  the Caricatura Museum Frankfurt in [[Frankfurt]], the [[Wilhelm Busch Museum]] in [[Hanover]] and the ''[[Cartoonmuseum Basel|Cartoonmuseum]]'' in [[Basel]]. The first museum of caricature in the [[Arab world]] was opened in March, 2009, at [[Fayoum]], Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A sanctuary for Egyptian caricature opens in Fayoum|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-194938082.html|publisher=''[[Daily News Egypt]]'' {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=8 September 2012|date=4 March 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505021743/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-194938082.html|archivedate=5 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2511">'''''Cath Gabhra''''' ([[English language|English]]: '''''The Battle of Gabhair''''' or '''''Gowra''''') is a narrative of the [[Fenian Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]]. It tells of the  destruction of the [[fianna]] and the deaths of most of its warriors in a battle against the forces of [[High King of Ireland|High King]] [[Cairbre Lifechair]]. It is notable for depicting the fianna, the heroes of the cycle, in a negative light.&lt;ref name="MacKillop"&gt;MacKillop, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cath Gabhra'' exists in many versions, and is referenced often in other works, including poems about Cairbre Lifechair in the [[Book of Leinster]] and in the long narrative ''[[Acallam na Senórach]]''. Cairbre's daughter Sgiam Sholais is betrothed to Maolsheachlainn, prince of the [[Déisi]], whose father Oengus has been killed by Cairbre's sons [[Fíacha Sroiptine]] and Eochaid Doimlen. However, the fianna and [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] demand a large tribute for the marriage, and Cairbre decides their power has corrupted them. He raises a vast army from [[Ulster]], [[Leinster]], and [[Connacht]], which is joined by the faction of the fianna loyal to Fionn's enemy [[Goll mac Morna]]. Fionn and the fianna are aided by the men of [[Munster]] and the Déisi. Cairbre starts the final battle by killing Fionn's servant Ferdia, and the armies meet at Gabhair for the final confrontation. The fianna's greatest warrior, Fionn's grandson [[Oscar (Irish mythology)|Oscar]] (the son of [[Oisín]]), slays Cairbre, but dies of his wounds, thereby sealing the fianna's fate. In some versions, Fionn himself is slain by Aichlech while he weeps over the death of his grandson. Cairbre's forces ultimately triumph, and the only survivors of the fianna are Oisín and [[Caílte mac Rónáin]], who live long enough to recount their tale to [[Saint Patrick]] two centuries later, according to ''Acallam na Senórach''.

The location of the battle varies from text to text. Gabhra is generally considered identical to the modern [[Garristown]], [[County Dublin]], but other texts place it in Glenn Gabhra, situated between the hills of [[Hill of Tara|Tara]] and [[Skryne]],  [[County Meath]].&lt;ref name="MacKillop"/&gt; Some chronicles give the date of battle as 284.&lt;ref name="MacKillop"/&gt;

'''Cornelis Christiaan Dommersen''' (Dommershuijzen), ( [[Utrecht]],  11 November 1842 – [[The Hague]], 23 May 1928)&lt;ref&gt;See:[https://www.wiewaswie.nl/personen-zoeken/zoeken/document/a2apersonid/123717695/srcid/28719164/oid/24 Wiewaswie], the [http://www.hetutrechtsarchief.nl/collectie/archiefbank/indexen/burgerlijke-stand/zoekresultaat?mivast=39&amp;miadt=39&amp;mizig=62&amp;miview=ldt&amp;milang=nl&amp;micols=1&amp;mires=0&amp;mizk_alle=Cornelis+Christiaan+Dommelhuizen&amp;mip1=&amp;mip2=&amp;mip3=&amp;mip4=&amp;mib1=&amp;mip5=&amp;mip6=&amp;mip7=&amp;mip8=&amp;mip9=&amp;mibj=&amp;miej= Utrechts Archief] [https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-1-10793-29612-12?cc=1831469&amp;wc=10705160 and his birthcertificate 1403 d.d. 12 november 1842 Utrecht]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[painter]] and a [[watercolourist]]. He signed his work as C.C. Dommershuizen, Chr. Dommelshuizen, Christian Dommelshuizen and C. Dommersen.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.rkd.nl/rkddb/(S(j3nglup0ddtkhevvqzj3d3qb))/detail.aspx Dommersen at the website of the RKD]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
The spelling of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] family name is rather complicated as it is spelled in many different ways such as Dommelshuizen, Dommershuizen, Dommershuyzen, [[Dommershuijzen]], Dommerson, with occasionally the Dutch prefix van . Although the paintings are usually signed as Dommersen. Cornelis Christiaan's older brother was [[Pieter Cornelis Dommersen]] (1833-1918), who was also born in Utrecht. Pieter Cornelis was a painter as well, gaining more fame than his younger brother. Both were illegitimate sons of  Cornelia  Dommershuitzen . In around 1850 Pieter Cornelis Dommersen moved to England and stayed there till his death in [[Hexham]] in 1918. Pieter Cornelis Dommersen had a son called [[William Raymond Dommersen]] (1859-1927), who also became a painter in England.

Cornelis Christiaan specialized just like his brother in sea -and river scapes and coastal scenery as those paintings had found a revival during the 19th century in Europe. He traveled abroad to countries such as England, America, Belgium and France, just like his countryman [[Abraham Hulk Senior]] did. However, in the end he found satisfaction painting not only river- and seascapes in the Netherlands but also the interior of villages and towns along the rivers. On his travels, he was often accompanied by his brother and his nephew.  He wappears to have been married twice without issue.

He married twice, first in The Hague Henriette Johanna Philippo, who was born c. 1852 in Amsterdam. He married 2nd in The Hague 26 May 1904 Carolina Maria Fredrica de Geus, who was born in Houtrijk en Polanen on 24 April 1852. Both marriages seem to have been childless.

==Exhibitions and Museums==
His work was exhibited in [[Amsterdam]], [[The Hague]] and [[Rotterdam]]. His work can be found in the museums of Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam and Utrecht.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25051">'''Craftivism''' is a form of [[activism]], typically incorporating elements of [[anti-capitalism]], [[environmentalism]], solidarity, or [[third-wave feminism]], that is centered on practices of [[craft]] - or what can traditionally be referred to as "domestic arts". Craftivism includes, but is not limited to, various forms of needlework including yarn-bombing or cross-stitch. Craftivism is a social process of collective empowerment, action, expression and negotiation. In craftivism, engaging in the social, performative and critical discourse around the work is central to its production and dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, Ele. "Activist Tendencies in Craft". http://research.gold.ac.uk/3109/, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners are known as '''craftivists'''.

== Background ==
The term '''craftivism''' was coined in 2003 by writer Betsy Greer in order to join the separate spheres of craft and activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greer|2008|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Craftivism, Arnolfini, Bristol |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/craftivism-arnolfini-bristol-1855855.html |first=Charles |last=Darwent |date=3 January 2010 |location=London |work=The Independent}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Her favorite self-created definition of the term states, "craftivism is a way of looking at life where voicing opinions through creativity makes your voice stronger, your compassion deeper &amp; your quest for justice more infinite"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Crafting a Green World. What is Craftivism? Division over the Definition Explodes Etsy Team |url=http://craftingagreenworld.com/2009/04/04/what-is-craftivism-division-over-the-definition-explodes-an-etsy-team/ |work=Crafting a Green World |first=Julie |last=Finn |date=April 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term craftivism is a recent addition to crafting lexicon, the use of craft as a subversive tactic can be found throughout history. First, the word craft is often associated with trickery. To call someone crafty is to identify them as clever and cunning &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bratich|2006|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek, one would say to "spin" a plot. Similarly, the French word for trick is tricoter, which means to tie or knot together.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bratich|2006|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', the character [[Madame Defarge]], a worker for the [[French Revolution]], secretly encodes the names of those soon to be executed in her knitting.

=== Feminism ===
Craftivism identifies strongly with feminist movements. Craftivism is often interpreted as having emerged from [[third-wave feminism]] but feminist activism and craft were unified beforehand.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bratich|first1=Jack|last2=Bush|first2=Heidi|title=Fabricating Activism: Craft Work, Popular Culture, Gender|journal=Project Muse|date=2011|volume=22|issue=2|url=https://www.academia.edu/1117424/Fabricating_Activism_Craft-Work_Popular_Culture_Gender|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practices of craft or "domestic arts" have traditionally existed and been organized spatially within the private sphere. Therefore, the labor and production of craft was generally interpreted as unproductive female labor in the home, as it was never integrated into profit-making systems. Rather, it was [[marginalized]] and undervalued.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bratich|2006|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, women's significant and creative work in the private sphere—clothing the family, knitting blankets, weaving the loom—did not receive the same respect as male-dominated activity in the public realm. Furthermore, the patriarchy has been successful in claiming these domestic values for women and using it as a way to keep women in subservient roles.&lt;ref name="Sabella"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sabella |first=Jennifer |date=May 12, 2008 |title= Craftivism: Is crafting the new activism? |work=The Columbia Chronicle |location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of consumer-friendly crafts, including kits, transfers and readymade designs, has further diminished the status of craft and women's amateur practices.&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Hackley, "Quiet Activism and the New Amateur," Design and Culture, 5:2 (2013): 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Women and craft have been excluded from the fine art world and as a result many women put their creativity towards craft practices. Craft was "a universal female art from transcending race, class, and national borders. Needlework is the one art in which women controlled the education of their daughters and the production of art, and were also the critics and audience."&lt;ref name="Packer 2010"/&gt; Although practices of craft were spatially organized within the private sphere, women occasionally would organize groups to engage in these practices collectively. In these craft circles or meet ups women would not only share patterns and skills but also engage in conversation about their lives in the private sphere. These groups of women would discuss their lives and personal struggles encountered as women. This type of group discussion is a form of activism rooted in [[Consciousness raising]] that was key to [[Second-wave feminism]]&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; as it helped to raise awareness about the types of oppression women were experiencing in their everyday lives.

The Anti Capitalist, Anti Sweatshop and DIY movements popularized practices of craft for activism. These movements influenced third-wave feminists to adopt a craftivism ethos. Most forms of craftivism identify strongly with [[third-wave feminism]]. Third-wave feminist crafters are attempting to subvert the association of craft with domesticity by embracing domestic arts while identifying as feminists who are making the choice to embrace this new domesticity. Third-wave feminists are reclaiming knitting, sewing, and other crafting activities traditionally feminized and associated with the private sphere. Through this reclamation, contemporary women aim to reconnect with the female-dominated art forms, to legitimatize the importance of undervalued craft, and to show that 21st century women have the privilege to express themselves through craft, with fewer constraints exercised by the patriarchy. This act of resistance and shattering of the public/private binary is expressed physically through public knitting and craft circles who take a private-sphere activity and insert themselves in the male-dominated spaces of the city&lt;ref name="Robertson, Kirsty 2006"&gt;Robertson, Kirsty. 30 March 2006. How to Knit an Academic Paper. Queen's University.&lt;/ref&gt; One example would be the [[Anarchist Knitting Mob]] who held a "Massive Knit" event in Washington Square Park to honour the death of activist and urbanist [[Jane Jacobs]].&lt;ref&gt;http://massiveknit.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Knitters decorated the trees, benches, and light posts with colourful yarn and unique patterns.
[[Sarah Corbett]], founder of [[Craftivist_Collective|Craftivist Collective]], encourages craftivists to set up private and public what she coined 'stitch-in' workshops.&lt;ref&gt;[https://craftivist-collective.com/blog/2013/09/how-to-host-your-own-stitch-in/ ''How To Host Your Own Stitch-In''] Craftivist-Collective.com. Retrieved 28 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism====
Women’s craft has often been undervalued or ignored in the art world. Women’s craft is considered belonging to a lesser cultural sphere and categorized under such terms as ‘applied’, ‘decorative’ or ‘lesser’ than other art forms such as painting or sculpture.&lt;ref name="Packer 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Packer|first1=Carolyn|title=The Evolution of Craft In Contemporary Feminist Art|journal=Scholarship Claremont|date=2010|url=http://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&amp;context=scripps_theses|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This critique of women’s craft and craftivism as a ‘lesser’ art form has been contested within the discourse of feminism. Some Feminist Art discourse excludes craftivism. This feminist intervention into the art world perpetuates a hierarchy of art where craft is a lower art form. Some feminists deem craftivism as reinforcing domesticity and consider it a retrogression of the feminist cause rather than a subversive tactic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raven|first1=Charlotte|title=How the 'New Feminism' Went Wrong|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/mar/06/charlotte-raven-feminism-madonna-price|website=www.theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmentalism ===
Craftivism is also centered on ideas of environmentalism and sustainability. When buying new materials, many craftivists choose organic fabrics and fairly traded products such as home-spun yarns. Yet, even more popular within the movement is the utilization of vintage, thrifted and repurposed goods in order to minimize waste and promote reuse. This display of resourcefulness acknowledges the finite resources on Earth, and the valorization of quality over quantity. Craftivist, Betsy Greer, is quoted saying, "While I think that crafting has become something fairly elite and cliquish in some areas, at its heart, it is very much made for individuals who value both their time and their money".&lt;ref name="Sabella"/&gt;

=== Anti-capitalism ===
Historically, craft was the pre-capitalist form of production, where each created item possessed a "use-value," a term comparing the usefulness of an item to the exchange equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Vivienne |last=Brown |year=2009 |editor=Stephanie Taylor |editor2=Steve Hinchliffe |editor3=John Clarke |editor4=Simon Bromley |chapter=Rubbish society: affluence, waste and values |title=Making Social Lives |location=Milton Keynes |publisher=The Open University |page=122 |isbn=0749216417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now within a capitalist system of mass production, craft has become a commodity to be bought and sold for money, where it is now referred to as having an "exchange-value".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bratich|2006|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this movement from use-value to exchange-value, there is less emphasis on the time and skill expended to create an object, and more importance on making it available to the masses as inexpensively as possible. Traditionally associated with a strong community so vital to the creation and distribution of craft, crafting has since lost its use-value and has been "captured by capital".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bratich|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular way to resist the commoditization of craft is through the Do-It-Yourself or DIY movement. Popularized through "zines" of the 1990s, DIY inspires people to be self-sufficient and to rely less on the market for basic necessities that can easily be created on one's own. DIY is a resistance to both the capitalist nature of the fashion industry and pressures to conform and buy a style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Higgins |first= Charlotte |date=January 31, 2005 |title=Political protest turns to the radical art of knitting |work= The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jan/31/arts.artsnews1 |accessdate=2 November 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the Counterfeit Crochet Project, which seeks to "debase and defile designer items one step at a time".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Counterfeit Crochet Project by Stephanie Syjuco http://www.counterfeitcrochet.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Crafters have also subverted the market through the use of open source patterns and information sharing on the internet. Sites like [[Burdastyle]] allow crafters to upload and download sewing projects at no charge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.burdastyle.com&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Cat Mazza's online software [[KnitPro]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microrevolt.org/knitPro.htm&lt;/ref&gt; allows users to download images into detailed knitting patterns at no charge.

====Anti-sweatshop====
Efforts within the craftivist movement against capitalism focus primarily on the international issue of [[sweatshops]]. Some craftivists believe that either sewing one's own clothing or buying only hand-made is the best way to protest unfair labor practices around the globe. Other craftivists take the issue even further, using the act of crafting as a protest against sweatshops. Artist and activist [[Cat Mazza]] created a campaign against the inhumane labor practices of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] through the creation of a giant blanket depicting Nike's trademark swoosh. From 2003-2008, international crafters were asked to mail in 4x4 inch stitched squares to border the blanket and to sign a petition against Nike.&lt;ref&gt;Microrevolt Blanket. http://www.microrevolt.org/web/blanket.htm April 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Mazza also created a second web-based software called [[Knitoscope]] that transforms video into animated knitted stitches.&lt;ref name="turbulence.org"&gt;http://www.turbulence.org/Works/microRevolt/testimonies.html&lt;/ref&gt; Each video has a corresponding testimony featuring various professionals who work against sweatshop labor.&lt;ref name="turbulence.org"/&gt;

Artist and Activist Kirsty Robertson feels that the subversive efforts of craftivists against capitalism are limited by their dependency on the internet and new communication. She points out that for this reason, global justice knitters are not completely removed from the economy themselves &lt;ref name="Robertson, Kirsty 2006"/&gt;

===Anti-war===
Some craftivists see their art form as a protest against war and violence. Anti-war craftivists choose to make their statement by juxtaposing a colorful, soft, and fuzzy yarn with cold and dangerous weapons. In 2006, Danish artist Marianne Jorgensen stitched a giant pink "tank blanket" and placed it over a M24 Chafee combat tank to protest the Iraq war.&lt;ref name="marianneart.dk"&gt;Pink M.24 Chafee. http://www.marianneart.dk/ April 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; She has been making these blankets since Denmark entered the Iraq War, and doesn't plan to stop until it is over. She writes on her website that, "Unsimilar to a war, knitting signals home, care, closeness and time for reflection...When [the tank] is covered in pink, it becomes completely unarmed and it loses its authority".&lt;ref name="marianneart.dk"/&gt; Much like Jorgensen, Canadian artist [[Barb Hunt]] works to question the acceptance of military logic in society by creating knitted antipersonnel land mines out of wool.&lt;ref name="Robertson, Kirsty 2006"/&gt;

Similar to her campaign against Nike, Cat Mazza started an anti-war effort entitled "Stitch for Senate" on the fourth anniversary of the Iraq War. She enlisted two people from each state to knit a soldier's helmet liner which would be sent on to every senator. Unlike the apolitical Operation Home Front efforts that knitted gear for soldiers, Mazza wanted "to start a dialogue about the war and to get politicians to keep the promises they made during the midterm elections".&lt;ref name="Gohil, Neha Singh 2007"&gt;Gohil, Neha Singh. March 13, 2007. Activists use knitting needles to make their point. Columbia News Service&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Viral Knitting Project]] is an anti-war effort that translates the 0/1 binary code of the dangerous Code Red computer virus into a knitting pattern of knit/purl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirstyrobertson.com/viral%20knitting/viral%20knitting.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713153258/http://www.kirstyrobertson.com/viral%20knitting/viral%20knitting.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The color and code relate to the anti-terrorism alerts of post 9/11 United States. The project is attempting to "draw together links between technology, culture, capitalism and war".&lt;ref name="Robertson, Kirsty 2006"/&gt;

===Social justice issues===
The Craftivist Collective, founded by Sarah Corbett, is an activist social enterprise which uses craftivism to engage people in social justice issues and solidarity movements.&lt;ref name="ohcomely"&gt;Charlotte Humphery, ''We'll change the world stitch by stitch'', ''Oh Comely'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etsy.com/au/listing/158988814/resistance|title=Resistance by Crafterdark|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a manifesto and a checklist of goals for the work of the group which includes being welcoming,&lt;ref name="satreview"&gt;Ruth Lewy, ''I get frustrated knitting socks. I want to make a difference.'', ''The Times Saturday Review'', 10 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; encouraging and positive,&lt;ref name="positive2"&gt;Rin Simpson, ''Getting crafty: a creative approach to activism'', ''Positive News'', Winter 2012&lt;/ref&gt; creative and non-threatening,&lt;ref name="house"&gt;Holly Howe, ''Sarah Corbett'', ''House'', Autumn 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and focusing on global poverty and human rights injustices.&lt;ref name="bigissuenorth"&gt;Jameela Oberman, ''Stitch in time'', ''Big Issue in the North'', 10–16 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Craftivist Collective's key achievements was to convince the [[M&amp;S]] board to pay their 50,000 employees the living wage in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Alexi Duggins, [https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2017/sep/18/why-craftivists-are-hiding-notes-in-pockets-during-london-fashion-week ''Is there a protest message in your new jacket's pocket? You've been shop-dropped''], theguardian.com, 18 September 2017, retrieved 28 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;.
This campaign was awarded with the Economic Justice Campaigner of the year 2017 by [[Sheila McKechnie Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://smk.org.uk/oxy_testimonial/sarah-corbett-craftivism-economic-justice-award-winner-2017/ ''Sarah Corbett, Craftivism, Economic Justice Award winner 2017''], smk.org.uk, 18 August 2017, retrieved 30 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;, and was nominated for the 2017 [[Care2]] UK Impact Award. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.care2services.com/2017-uk-impact-award ''Vote now for the 2017 UK Impact Award finalists!''] care2services.com, retrieved 28 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

On the back of this award, Sarah Corbett continues to work with large charities to deliver strategic craftivism projects and teach them in the art of gentle protest.&lt;ref&gt;Kirstie Brewer [https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-42181743 ''Why I leave hidden messages in High Street clothes''], bbc.com, 1 December 2017, retrieved 30 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guerrilla Kindness ===
Australian artist Sayraphim Lothian uses craftivism to "make people's day brighter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/christchurch-life/art-and-stage/9834934/Kakapo-sculptures-hidden-in-Christchurch |title=Kakapo sculptures hidden in Christchurch |website=Stuff.co.nz |date=17 March 2014 |author=Will Harve |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She leaves small handcrafted works of art on the streets for people to find and take home  “aimed at creating tiny bubbles of joy in the lives of passersby, tiny surreal moments that might make people do a double take.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/alannaokun/people-who-use-crafting-for-activism |title=10 People Who Use Crafting For Activism |website=buzzfeed.com |date=22 April 2014 |author=Alanna Okun |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protest models ==
When craftivists take to the street, they utilize various protest models.

A popular form of protest is the "knit-in," where knitters infiltrate a public space and knit. They might ride a subway, occupy a civic building, or sit in a park. They use the knit-in to draw attention to their issue of concern. The [[Revolutionary Knitting Circle]] of Calgary, Canada stage a knit-in in front of Calgary's financial office buildings during the summit of the G-8 nations in 2002.&lt;ref name="Gohil, Neha Singh 2007"/&gt; The Knit-in not only provides an opportunity to protest against injustice, but also allows for a running discussion about social issues between the stationary knitters. Jack Bratich of [[Rutgers University]] argues that, "Knitting in public also creates a gendered question of space. It rips open the enclosure of the domestic space to public consumption, exposing productive work that has contributed to women's invisible and unpaid labor".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bratich|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women are, thereby, able to gain power from an activity that previously symbolized their repression.

Craftivist [[Carrie Reichardt]] has covered her home, car and studio with mosaics which utilizes  ceramics, screen-printing and transfers to highlight "plight of inmates on death row, the Black Panthers, and the spirituality of the planet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/07/homes |title=Interiors |newspaper=The Guardian |date=6 February 2010 |author=Kate Makhail |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of craft-themed activism is guerilla art. The Texas-based group [[Knitta]] places street art such as street pole cozies and antenna warmers in cities throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Knitta homepage|url=http://www.knittaplease.com/Home.html|website=knittaplease.com|accessdate=20 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306151047/http://www.knittaplease.com/Home.html|archivedate=6 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a blogger in England, Sarah Corbett, "creates textile art with political messages in public spaces first by herself at a blog called 'a lonely craftivist' and then as the head of the worldwide Craftivist Collective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alonelycraftivist.blogspot.com/ |title=a lonely craftivist |website=alonelycraftivist.blogspot.com |date=4 October 2009 |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volunteers for [[Postcards To Voters]] often create their own hand-decorated postcards to send to potential voters ahead of elections in hopes of increasing turnout. The work can be done solo, but is often done at "postcarding parties" at a volunteer's home or a cafe.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Writing Postcards Brings Voters Back From the Edge: ‘It’s Sharpie Therapy’ |date=November 1, 2018 |last1=Tackett |first1=Michael |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/us/politics/postcards-democrats-midterm-elections.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In transition==
In the spring of 2009, an online debate began over the definition of craftivism. The debate spread after the self-titled Craftivism team on [[Etsy]] had an inner-group argument about the political affiliation of its members, causing some members to leave the group. 
The original description of the group states, "The Etsy Craftivism Team is a team of progressive Etsyans who believe that craft and art can change the world. Some of us use our work to carry messages of protest and political activism. Others believe that the act of making craft can be an act of resistance. Still others see that by buying and selling directly from the maker we are challenging the all pervasive corporate culture that promotes profit over people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://craftingagreenworld.com/2009/04/04/what-is-craftivism-division-over-the-definition-explodes-an-etsy-team/ |title=What is Craftivism? Division over the Definition Explodes an Etsy Team - Crafting a Green World |website=Craftingagreenworld.com |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Conservative members accused the group of assuming a liberal agenda, and argued that politics should not be involved. Some members of the group felt that the mere act of crafting itself was political, while others felt that the act must also be attached to a political message. Rayna Fahey from Radical Cross Stitch replied to a thread stating "Personally if a John McCain supporter joined this group and told me that my latest piece in support of indigenous sovereignty was a well-made piece that serves the purpose for which it was designed well, I'd think that was awesome and I'd have hope for the future of this world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Whose Craftivism?|url=http://radicalcrossstitch.com/2009/04/06/whose-craftivism/|website=radicalcrossstitch.com|accessdate=20 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408031802/http://radicalcrossstitch.com/2009/04/06/whose-craftivism/|archivedate=8 April 2009|date=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, craftivist Betsy Greer believes that "the personal is political," and that you cannot separate the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greer|2008|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dendermonde Codex''' or sometimes called '''Villarenser Kodex''' or '''codex 9''' of the [[Dendermonde Abbey]],&lt;ref&gt;Hildegard of Bingen: Woman of Vision /Carol Reed-Jones&lt;/ref&gt; is a valuable manuscript containing the ''Symphonia harmoniae caelestium revelationum'' of [[Hildegard of Bingen]].&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/bljde_20130731_001|publisher=nieuwsblad.be|title=Dendermonde Codex in doctoraatsthesis (Dendermonde) - Het Nieuwsblad|accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
This valuable manuscript is kept in a 19th-century monastery because, it did pass in several other Benedictine monasteries.&lt;ref name="stretto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stretto.be/hildegard-von-bingen-in-dendermonde/|publisher=stretto.be|title=HILDEGARD VON BINGEN IN DENDERMONDE &amp;#124; Stretto &amp;#8211; Magazine voor kunst, geschiedenis en muziek|accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Historians]] believe it was first sent to the Belgian [[Villers Abbey]], hence the name Villarensis. It then moved to [[Gembloux Abbey]]
and finally it arrived in the famous [[Affligem Abbey]], where the monks were chased out in 1796. In 1869/70, the abbey of Affligem was re-established, but the valuable collection did not return and is kept until today inside Dendermonde Abbey. The Bingen manuscript is considered the most valuable of the library, and is world-famous therefor.

== The Manuscript ==
The collection of songs inside the codex was named by Hildegard ''Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum&lt;ref name="alamirefoundation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alamirefoundation.org/en/publications/hildegard-bingen-symphonia-harmoniae-caelestium-revelationum-dendermonde-st-pieters-pau|publisher=alamirefoundation.org|title=Hildegard of Bingen, Symphonia harmoniae caelestium revelationum. Dendermonde, St.-Pieters &amp;amp; Paulusabdij, Ms. Cod. 9 &amp;#124; International Centre for the Study of Music in the Low Countries|accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.

The current manuscript is not complete as several folios are missing. However, it still contains 183 folios, made of parchment, containing 60 psalmes and cantica in honour of father and son.&lt;ref name="hetstillepand"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hetstillepand.be/von_bingen.html|publisher=hetstillepand.be|title=Hildegard von Bingen|accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is dated ca. 1176 A.D. and is considered one of the major works by Hildegard von Bingen.

'''Ernestine Panckoucke''', née Désormeaux aka '''Anne-Ernestine Panckoucke''' (1784-1860), was a talented French botanical illustrator and flower painter, and considered one of [[Redouté]]'s most gifted students. 

She described herself as a 'translator of [[Goethe]]'s poems, pupil of Redouté and designer of [[François-Pierre Chaumeton|Chaumeton]]'s "Flore Médicale"', published by her husband Charles Louis Fleury Panckoucke (1780-1844). She illustrated this work with [[Pierre Jean François Turpin]] (1775-1840). She is thought to have met Redouté at either the [[Château de Malmaison]] whilst a student under [[Prud'hon]], or at [[Jean-Baptiste Isabey]]'s studio while sitting for a portrait. Afterwards she regularly attended Redoute's classes at the [[Jardin des Plantes]]. Redouté had been commissioned by Empress Joséphine to depict the roses and lilies at Malmaison. 

One of her works was sold at the [[Charles X of France|Duc de Berry]]'s 1834 sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donaldheald.com/search/search_01.php?Author=PANCKOUCKE%2C%20Anne-Ernestine |publisher=Donald Heald |title=PANCKOUCKE, Anne-Ernestine (1784-1860) |accessdate=8 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418080412/http://www.donaldheald.com/search/search_01.php?Author=PANCKOUCKE%2C%20Anne-Ernestine |archivedate=18 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origin===
Free Speech Coalition is the trade association of the adult entertainment industry in the United States. Founded in 1991, it opposes the passage and enforcement of some censorship laws (with the exception of "anti-piracy" laws) and obscenity laws. The concept of an organization as a rallying point for those who believe in the free expression of adult-themed works began as early as 1970. The first truly national group to emerge was the [[Adult Film Association of America]] (AFAA). At that time, adult entertainment was only available in adult theaters and bookstores so early members were largely theatrical exhibitors.

With the advent of inexpensive home videos, the AFAA became the Adult Film and Video Association of America (AFVAA). The next significant event that galvanized the AFVAA was the arrest of [[Hal Freeman]] for [[Procuring (prostitution)|pandering]]. Prosecutors wanted to establish once and for all that paying performers to have sex in a film was an act of prostitution. Freeman won that legal battle, which redefined the use of the pandering laws relative to providers of adult product. As video productions became the dominant factor in the marketplace, theatrical exhibition diminished. The [[Freeman decision]] effectively legalized the production of adult films in the state of California.

Video chains and many independent stores in suburbs and smaller cities started carrying adult fare. Law enforcement officials subjected more and more retailers to obscenity charges. Then, in 1990, under the first [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush#Presidency .281989.E2.80.931993.29|Bush administration]], the Federal government attacked most of the major manufacturers of adult video with a sting operation designed to destroy the industry.

===Legal advocacy===
In response, the Free Speech Legal Defense Fund (FSLDF) was formed by industry leaders to protect the rights of members in all areas of adult entertainment. In 1991, as the government attack was blunted, the FSLDF decided to select a name more reflective of its broadened role in the adult community, and the Free Speech Coalition was born. The association became closely aligned with other organizations representing the rights of free speech and civil liberties

In 1995, a comprehensive Federal scheme regulating the creation and wholesale distribution of recorded images of sexual conduct went into effect. Aimed at detecting and deterring child pornography, the Federal Labeling Law (also known as the [[Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act]]) eliminated all privacy in the creation of sexual images. Any producers of, and performers in, such materials were ordered to comply with detailed disclosure requirements. In order for the industry to comply, the FSC was essential. FSC conducted training seminars, prepared compliance documents and uniform exemption labels and negotiated with the Justice Department for relief from some of the more burdensome and unreasonable components of the law.

It was FSC's response to the [[Federal Labeling and Record-Keeping Law|Federal Labeling Law]] that established broadly throughout the industry the necessity of a functional trade organization to assist the industry.

===Member advocacy===
In February 2015, the FSC announced an affiliation with the [[First Entertainment Credit Union]]. The arrangement with make member financial services available to approved production studios employees and their families, primarily in the [[adult film]] industry. [[Diane Duke]], CEO of the FSC, stated "We are thrilled to be able to offer active FSC members and their families the opportunity to access First Entertainment for their banking needs and many other financial services. Especially because of difficulties faced by industry members that have had their business turned away by other institutions."&lt;ref name=2015FSC&gt;{{cite web|title=FSC Partners with Credit Union to Provide Banking to Members|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/FSC-Partners-with-Credit-Union-to-Provide-Banking-to-Members-589749.html |website=AVN.com|publisher=''Adult Video News''|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lobbyist activity===
The FSC entered the field of lobbying in earnest in 1994, with the retention of a lobbyist in [[Sacramento, California]]'s state capitol. After a year, the lobbying presence proved itself critical for the health of the national industry. A tax bill was introduced, with the purpose of assisting victims of domestic abuse and rape. An excise tax was proposed for all adult products and services, with the proceeds going to collection of the tax, law enforcement and, if anything remained, to rape counseling centers and battered victim shelters.

Constitutional law had long forbade the targeting of a content-defined tax and this bill was the model of such a tax scheme. Traditionally the industry had relied solely on the judiciary to protect itself against such intrusions, and legislatures across the country have become accustomed to regulating the adult industry without consultation with the parties to be regulated. Both patterns came to a halt with this proposed tax.

The FSC led a coalition of affected businesses and industry groups in fighting the tax. The FSC argued that the tax was a dangerous, unconstitutional precedent and that it would be bad for the state's economy. During the course of the ensuing debate, the economic influence of the adult entertainment industry was established in the minds of the zero votes in support. The bill was defeated at its first committee hearing.

===First Amendment ===
The industry and FSC were placed in a difficult position by the amendment of the Federal Child Pornography laws in 1997, which included "simulated" child pornography within the definition of child pornography. The redefinition of child pornography to include adults appearing to be minors, engaging in actual or simulated sexual activity was controversial. The Senate Judiciary Committee (the committee of origin), never even held a vote on the bill, yet it was signed into law, following Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] (R-Utah) attaching it during the Conference Committee to the October 1997 Spending Bill. Under the definition, films such as ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'', ''[[Animal House]]'', ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', ''[[Halloween (franchise)|Halloween]]'', ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'', ''[[Return to the Blue Lagoon]]'', ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', ''[[Risky Business]]'', ''[[Porky's]]'', ''[[Bull Durham]]'', ''[[Blowup]]'', ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', and ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' were now subject to prosecution and potentially a five-year mandatory minimum imprisonment. When these concerns were brought to Senator Hatch's staff, they responded by conceding that such films could be charged but that "legitimate" movies need not fear prosecution. The FSC challenged the constitutionality of the law. For the first time since its own redefinition as a trade association, FSC undertook litigation challenging the constitutionality of a Federal statute.

In 1999, FSC hired its first full-time Executive Director and began to gain a national reputation as a defender of First and Fourth Amendment rights. During the Clinton Administration, there were few obscenity prosecutions. Then-Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] seemed to see "obscenity" as a victimless crime. She also realized that in many areas community standards had changed and "obscenity" convictions were becoming more difficult to sustain.

In 1996 the "[[Communications Decency Act]]" (CDA) was enacted to protect children from accessing adult material on the Internet. The [[Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996|Child Pornography Protection Act]] (CPPA) soon followed; this legislation sought to criminalize the depiction of minors in sexually explicit video or online content, even if those depicted in the material were over 18-years of age. FSC filed suit against then-Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]], charging that the CPPA abridged first amendment rights by defining protected speech as obscene or as child pornography. In 2002, FSC views were upheld in the US Supreme Court in "[[Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition]]", the "virtual child porn" case.

In 2005, FSC filed a complaint against the Dept of Justice and then-Attorney General [[Alberto Gonzales]], citing that 18 U.S.C. § 2257 regulations endangered the privacy and safety of performers by allowing private information to be accessed through the record-keeping process; also that 2257 regulations were complicated to the extent that adult producers would be unable to fully comply with the record-keeping system.

The controversial regulations have been an ongoing issue for adult industry producers and FSC. In February 2009, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] held in ''[[Connection Distributing Co. v. Holder]]'' that the record-keeping provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 2257 did not violate the First Amendment. A revised set of the § 2257 regulations was released in December 2009, prompting another complaint against the DOJ and Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] in 2010.

The FSC Lifetime Achievement Awards are given to adult industry businesses and professionals for outstanding achievements and contributions to the adult entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freespeechcoalition.com/pressreleasesmedia/135-award.html|title=FSC Business Award Winners Announced|publisher=Free Speech Coalition|date=6 October 2009|accessdate=2010-02-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109100140/http://www.freespeechcoalition.com/pressreleasesmedia/135-award.html|archivedate=9 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were launched in mid-1988 by the [[Adult Film Association of America|Adult Video Association]] at its annual Night of the Stars fundraising event, replacing its discontinued [[Adult Film Association of America#Erotic Film Awards|Erotic Film Awards]]. When the association merged into the Free Speech Coalition in late 1992, the new coalition took over the tradition. [[Adult Film Association of America#Lifetime Achievement Awards|Previous years' awards]] are listed at the AVA Wikipedia entry. Starting in 2008 an "Election Bash" in the fall replaced the former Night of the Stars awards ceremony, reflecting the FSC's change in focus from the entertainers to the business side of the industry.&lt;ref name="xbiz100708"&gt;Ariana Rodriguez, [http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php?id=100039&amp;mi=all&amp;q=night+of+the+stars "AEBN’s Scott Coffman Named FSC’s Man of the Year"], October 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The award presentations were normally made late in the year, but starting in 2014 they were changed to January as part of the XBIZ 360 conference, which is also site of the [[XBIZ Award]] ceremony. Thus the awards normally presented in late 2013 were given out in January 2014. In 2015 a new award, the Christian Mann Courage and Leadership Award, was added.&lt;ref name=avn010915&gt;{{cite web|title=FSC Award Recipients Announced|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/FSC-Award-Recipients-Announced-584097.html |publisher=''Adult Video News''|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Eugeniou''' (born June 1931) is a Cypriot actor, director and writer. He is the founder and artistic director of Theatro Technis in London, England, which was established in 1957.

==Early life and career==

George Eugeniou was born in [[Limassol]], [[Cyprus]]. He came to London in 1950 to study theatre with the support of his eldest sister, Loula Ionnides, and her family.

He trained at [[Morley College]], where he met Frank Drew, who gave him free lessons in diction and voice. With Drew's help, Eugeniou received a scholarship at the [[Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art]], where he won a Spotlight and a Webber Cup awards for his acting abilities.

In 1954 he joined [[Dundee Repertory Theatre]] company in Scotland as assistant stage manager, while also performing small parts. Then, he returned to London and joined a Cypriot amateur group under the auspices of The Cypriot Brotherhood with Paul Stasino, Anna Koutayiar and Theo Moreas. One year later he joined Sir [[Donald Wolfit]]'s company which was performing the play ''The Strong are Lonely'', touring all the major cities of England ending at [[Piccadilly Theatre]] first and then at the [[Haymarket Theatre]]. In 1956, he joined [[Joan Littlewood]]'s Theatre Workshop in [[Stratford East]] with several productions, including ''[[The Quare Fellow]]'' by [[Brendan Behan]].

==Theatro Technis==

In 1957, Eugeniou founded Theatro Technis, which was neither commercial nor subsidised, with the help of a group of actors, workers and students, including Andreas Markou, Stelios Kyriacou, Medea O'Brennon, Andy Lysandrou and [[Spyros Kyprianou]]. Theatro Technis can be defined as a "radical and total" theatre as Eugeniou's philosophy is to break barriers between nationalities, religions, genders, sexual orientations, classes, ages and languages.

Eugeniou has totally dedicated himself to Theatro Technis, abandoning his career as a mainstream actor, apart from a few movies in the 1950s and '60s. As Theatro Technis' artistic director he devised, directed and acted in numerous productions, often inspired by Cypriot or Greek artists and events. He was among the first to produce plays written or acted by black personalities such as Mark Heath, Harcourt Nichols, and Peter Blackman. Eugeniou has helped hundreds of student from all over London and abroad, proposing work-experiences or internships, free of charge. His passion for alternative theatre remains a common thread in his work as he always believes that the creative spirit is not for sale.

Still marked by his Cypriot accent, Eugeniou staged a production of [[Aristophanes]]' famous satires, as ''Women in Parliament'', in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/reviews/women-in-parlia-theatre-technis-8907 Howard Loxton, "Women in Parliament – Aristophanes, translated by G Theodorides, Theatro Technis, Camden", British Theatre Guide.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Help to the Cypriot community==

In 1967, he initiated the Cyprus Week, an annual festival to highlight the Cypriot culture and way of life in the United Kingdom and to create a greater awareness of the struggle of [[Cyprus]] against British colonialism and [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]]. He is also one of the founders of the [[National Federation of Cypriots]] in England, an umbrella organisation of more than one hundred Cypriot organisations.

In 1968, he created the first Cypriot Advisory Service in the United Kingdoms, which has helped thousands of Cypriot migrants and refugees receive welfare benefits, education, or housing. He also instigated and helped build the Cyprus Villages Housing in partnership with St Pancras Housing Association in the late 1980s. This "from life to art to life" philosophy is a cornerstone of his work.

==Personal life==

In 1969, George Eugeniou married Maroulla Sekkides, who became an actress with Theatro Technis. They have a son Aris, who is also dedicated to the theatre.

[[File:Group action on equilateral triangle.svg|right|thumb|Given an [[equilateral triangle]], the counterclockwise [[rotation]] by 120° around the center of the triangle maps every vertex of the triangle to another one. The [[cyclic group]] ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; consisting of the rotations by 0°, 120° and 240° acts on the set of the three vertices.]]

In [[mathematics]], an '''action''' of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] is a formal way of interpreting the manner in which the elements of the group correspond to transformations of some [[Space (mathematics)|space]] in a way that preserves the [[mathematical structure|structure]] of that space. Common examples of spaces that groups act on are [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], [[vector spaces]], and [[topological spaces]]. Actions of groups on vector spaces are called [[Group representation|representations]] of the group.

When there is a natural correspondence between the set of group elements and the set of space transformations, a group can be interpreted as acting on the space in a [[canonical map|canonical]] way. For example, the [[symmetric group]] of a finite [[set (mathematics)|set]] consists of all [[bijective]] transformations of that set; thus, applying any element of the permutation group to an element of the set will produce another (not necessarily distinct) element of the set. More generally, [[symmetry groups]] such as the [[homeomorphism group]] of a [[topological space]] or the [[general linear group]] of a [[vector space]], as well as their subgroups, also admit canonical actions. For other groups, an interpretation of the group in terms of an action may have to be specified, either because the group does not act canonically on any space or because the canonical action is not the action of interest. For example, we can specify an action of the two-element [[cyclic group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C}_2 = \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; on the finite set &lt;math&gt;\{a,b,c\}&lt;/math&gt; by specifying that 0 (the identity element) sends &lt;math&gt;a\mapsto a,b\mapsto b,c\mapsto c&lt;/math&gt;, and that 1 sends &lt;math&gt;a\mapsto b,b\mapsto a,c\mapsto c&lt;/math&gt;. This action is not canonical.

A common way of specifying non-canonical actions is to describe a [[homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; from a group ''G'' to the group of symmetries of a set ''X''. The action of an element &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; on a point &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be identical to the action of its image &lt;math&gt;\varphi(g) \in \text{Sym}(X)&lt;/math&gt; on the point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is also frequently called the "action" of ''G'', since specifying &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to specifying an action. Thus, if ''G'' is a group and ''X'' is a set, then an action of ''G'' on ''X'' may be formally defined as a [[group homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; from ''G'' to the [[symmetric group]] of ''X''. The action assigns a [[permutation]] of ''X'' to each element of the group in such a way that:
* the [[identity element]] of ''G'' is assigned the [[identity transformation]] of ''X'';
* any product ''gk'' of two elements of ''G'' is assigned the [[function composition|composition]] of the permutations assigned to ''g'' and&amp;nbsp;''k''.
If ''X'' has additional structure, then &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is only called an action if for each &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;, the permutation &lt;math&gt;\varphi(g)&lt;/math&gt; preserves the structure of&amp;nbsp;''X''.

The [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction]] provided by group actions is a powerful one, because it allows geometrical ideas to be applied to more abstract objects. Many objects in mathematics have natural group actions defined on them. In particular, groups can act on other groups, or even on themselves. Because of this generality, the theory of group actions contains wide-reaching [[theorem]]s, such as the orbit stabilizer theorem, which can be used to prove deep results in several fields.

If ''G'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] and ''X'' is a set, then a (''left'') ''group action'' ''&amp;phi;'' of ''G'' on ''X'' is a function
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi\colon G \times X \to X\colon (g,x)\mapsto \varphi(g,x)&lt;/math&gt;
that satisfies the following two axioms (where we denote ''&amp;phi;''(''g'', ''x'') as ''g''⋅''x''):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eie &amp; Chang |title=A Course on Abstract Algebra|year=2010|url={{Google books|plainurl=y|id=jozIZ0qrkk8C|page=144|text=group action}}|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Identity: {{nowrap|1=''e''⋅''x'' = ''x''}} for all ''x'' in ''X''. (Here, ''e'' denotes the identity element of the group ''G''.)
; Compatibility: {{nowrap|1=(''gh'')⋅''x'' = ''g''⋅(''h''⋅''x'')}} for all ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'' and all ''x'' in ''X''. (Here, ''gh'' denotes the result of applying the group operation of ''G'' to the elements ''g'' and ''h''.)

The group ''G'' is said to act on ''X'' (on the left). The set ''X'' is called a (''left'') ''G-set''.

From these two axioms, it follows that for every ''g'' in ''G'', the function which maps ''x'' in ''X'' to ''g''⋅''x'' is a [[bijective function|bijective map]] from ''X'' to ''X'' (its [[inverse function|inverse]] being the function which maps ''x'' to ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''x''). Therefore, one may alternatively define a group action of ''G'' on ''X'' as a [[group homomorphism]] from ''G'' into the [[symmetric group]] Sym(''X'') of all bijections from ''X'' to ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;This is done, e.g., by {{cite book|author=Smith |title=Introduction to abstract algebra|year=2008|url={{Google books|plainurl=y|id=PQUAQh04lrUC|page=253|text=group action}}|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In complete analogy, one can define a ''right group action'' of ''G'' on ''X'' as an operation {{nowrap|''X'' × ''G'' → ''X''}} mapping {{nowrap|(''x'', ''g'')}} to ''x''⋅''g'' and satisfying the two axioms:
; Identity: {{nowrap|1=''x''⋅''e'' = ''x''}} for all ''x'' in ''X''.
; Compatibility: {{nowrap|1=''x''⋅(''gh'') = (''x''⋅''g'')⋅''h''}} for all ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'' and all ''x'' in ''X'';

The difference between left and right actions is in the order in which a product like ''gh'' acts on ''x''. For a left action ''h'' acts first and is followed by ''g'', while for a right action ''g'' acts first and is followed by ''h''. Because of the formula {{nowrap|1=(''gh'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, one can construct a left action from a right action by composing with the inverse operation of the group. Also, a right action of a group ''G'' on ''X'' is the same thing as a left action of its [[opposite group]] ''G''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; on ''X''. It is thus sufficient to only consider left actions without any loss of generality.

== Types of actions ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Diffeomorphism]], and redirected from "Transitive action" --&gt;
The action of ''G'' on ''X'' is called
* ''{{visible anchor|Transitive}}'' if ''X'' is non-empty and if for each pair ''x'', ''y'' in ''X'' there exists a ''g'' in ''G'' such that {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''y''}}. For example, the action of the symmetric group of ''X'' is transitive, the action of the [[general linear group]] or the [[special linear group]] of a vector space ''V'' on {{nowrap|''V'' ∖ {0}{{null}}}} is transitive, but the action of the [[orthogonal group]] of a [[Euclidean space]] ''E'' is not transitive on {{nowrap|''E'' ∖ {0}{{null}}}} (it is transitive on the [[unit sphere]] of ''E'', though).
* ''{{visible anchor|Faithful}}'' (or ''{{visible anchor|effective}}'') if for every two distinct ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'' there exists an ''x'' in ''X'' such that {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' ≠ ''h''⋅''x''}}; or equivalently, if for each {{nowrap|''g'' ≠ ''e''}} in ''G'' there exists an ''x'' in ''X'' such that {{nowrap|''g''⋅''x'' ≠ ''x''}}.  In other words, in a faithful group action, different elements of ''G'' induce different permutations of ''X''. In algebraic terms, a group ''G'' acts faithfully on ''X'' [[if and only if]] the corresponding homomorphism to the symmetric group, {{nowrap|''G'' → Sym(''X'')}}, has a trivial [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]]. Thus, for a faithful action, ''G'' embeds into a [[permutation group]] on ''X''; specifically, ''G'' is isomorphic to its image in Sym(''X''). If ''G'' does not act faithfully on ''X'', one can easily modify the group to obtain a faithful action. If we define {{nowrap|1=''N'' = {''g'' in ''G'' : ''g''⋅''x'' = ''x'' for all ''x'' in ''X''}{{null}}}}, then ''N'' is a [[normal subgroup]] of ''G''; indeed, it is the kernel of the homomorphism {{nowrap|''G'' → Sym(''X'')}}. The [[factor group]] ''G''/''N'' acts faithfully on ''X'' by setting {{nowrap|1=(''gN'')⋅''x'' = ''g''⋅''x''}}. The original action of ''G'' on ''X'' is faithful if and only if {{nowrap|1=''N'' = {''e''}{{null}}}}.
* ''{{visible anchor|Free}}'' (or ''semiregular'' or ''fixed point free'') if, given ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'', the existence of an ''x'' in ''X'' with {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''h''⋅''x''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''g'' = ''h''}}. Equivalently: if ''g'' is a group element and there exists an ''x'' in ''X'' with {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''x''}} (that is, if ''g'' has at least one fixed point), then ''g'' is the identity. Note that a free action on a [[non-empty]] set is faithful.
* ''{{visible anchor|Regular}}'' (or ''{{visible anchor|simply transitive}}'' or ''sharply transitive'') if it is both transitive and free; this is equivalent to saying that for every two ''x'', ''y'' in ''X'' there exists precisely one ''g'' in ''G'' such that {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''y''}}.  In this case, ''X'' is called a [[principal homogeneous space]] for ''G'' or a ''G''-torsor. The action of any group ''G'' on itself by left multiplication is regular, and thus faithful as well. Every group can, therefore, be embedded in the symmetric group on its own elements, Sym(''G''). This result is known as [[Cayley's theorem]].
* ''{{visible anchor|n-transitive}}'' if ''X'' has at least ''n'' elements and for all pairwise distinct ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and pairwise distinct ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' there is a ''g'' in ''G'' such that {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''y&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for {{nowrap|1 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''n''}}.  A 2-transitive action is also called ''{{visible anchor|doubly transitive}}'', a 3-transitive action is also called ''triply transitive'', and so on.  Such actions define interesting classes of subgroups in the symmetric groups: [[2-transitive group]]s and more generally [[multiply transitive group]]s. The action of the symmetric group on a set with ''n'' elements is always ''n''-transitive; the action of the [[alternating group]] is ''n-2''-transitive.
* ''{{visible anchor|Sharply n-transitive}}'' if there is exactly one such ''g''.
* ''{{visible anchor|Primitive}}'' if it is transitive and preserves no non-trivial partition of ''X''. See [[primitive permutation group]] for details.
* ''Locally free'' if ''G'' is a [[topological group]], and there is a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] ''U'' of ''e'' in ''G'' such that the restriction of the action to ''U'' is free; that is, if  {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''x''}} for some ''x'' and some ''g'' in ''U'' then {{nowrap|1=''g'' = ''e''}}.

Furthermore, if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acts on a [[topological space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then the action is:

*''Wandering'' if every point &lt;math&gt; x \in X &lt;/math&gt; has a neighbourhood &lt;math&gt; U &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{g \in G : g \cdot U \cap U \neq \emptyset\}&lt;/math&gt; is finite.&lt;ref name="Thurston 1980 p175"&gt;{{Citation | last1=Thurston | first1=William | title=The geometry and topology of three-manifolds | url=http://library.msri.org/books/gt3m/ | series=Princeton lecture notes | year=1980 | page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the action of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z^n&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; by translations is wandering. The action of the [[modular group]] on the Poincaré half-plane is also wandering.
*''Properly discontinuous'' if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[locally compact space]] and for every compact subset &lt;math&gt;K \subset X&lt;/math&gt; the set &lt;math&gt;\{g \in G: gK \cap K \neq \emptyset \}&lt;/math&gt; is finite. The wandering actions given above are also properly discontinuous. On the other hand, the action of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^2 \setminus \{0\}&lt;/math&gt; by the linear map &lt;math&gt;(x, y) \mapsto (2x, 1/2y)&lt;/math&gt; is wandering and free but not properly discontinuous.{{sfn|Thurston|1980|p=176}}
*''{{visible anchor|Proper}}'' if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a topological group and the map from &lt;math&gt;G \times X \rightarrow X \times X : (g,x) \mapsto (g \cdot x,x)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Proper map|proper]].&lt;ref name="tom Dieck 1987 p29"&gt;{{Citation | last1=tom Dieck | first1=Tammo | title=Transformation groups | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=azcQhi6XeioC | publisher=Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co. | location=Berlin | series=de Gruyter Studies in Mathematics | isbn=978-3-11-009745-0 | mr=889050 | year=1987 | volume=8 | page=29 | doi=10.1515/9783110858372.312}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''G'' is [[Discrete group|discrete]] then properness is equivalent to proper discontinuity for ''G''-actions.
* Said to have ''discrete orbits'' if the orbit of each &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; under the action of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is discrete in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Thurston 1980 p175" /&gt;

If ''X'' is a non-zero [[module (mathematics)|module]] over a ring ''R'' and the action of ''G'' is ''R''-linear then it is said to be 
* ''Irreducible'' if there is no nonzero proper invariant submodule.

==&lt;span id="orbstab"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="quotient"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Orbits and stabilizers ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Symmetry]] --&gt;
[[File:Compound of five tetrahedra.png|thumb|In the [[compound of five tetrahedra]], the symmetry group is the (rotational) [[icosahedral group]] ''I'' of order 60, while the stabilizer of a single chosen tetrahedron is the (rotational) [[tetrahedral group]] ''T'' of order 12, and the orbit space ''I''/''T'' (of order 60/12&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5) is naturally identified with the 5 tetrahedra – the coset ''gT'' corresponds to the tetrahedron to which ''g'' sends the chosen tetrahedron.]]

Consider a group ''G'' acting on a set ''X''. The ''orbit'' of an element ''x'' in ''X'' is the set of elements in ''X'' to which ''x'' can be moved by the elements of ''G''. The orbit of ''x'' is denoted by ''G''⋅''x'':

:&lt;math&gt; G\cdot x = \left\{ g\cdot x \mid g \in G \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The defining properties of a group guarantee that the set of orbits of (points ''x'' in) ''X'' under the action of ''G'' form a [[partition of a set|partition]] of ''X''. The associated [[equivalence relation]] is defined by saying {{nowrap|''x'' ∼ ''y''}} [[if and only if]] there exists a ''g'' in ''G'' with {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''y''}}. The orbits are then the [[equivalence class]]es under this relation; two elements ''x'' and ''y'' are equivalent if and only if their orbits are the same; i.e., {{nowrap|1=''G''⋅''x'' = ''G''⋅''y''}}.

The group action is [[Group action#Types of actions|transitive]] if and only if it has exactly one orbit, i.e., if there exists ''x'' in ''X'' with {{nowrap|1=''G''⋅''x'' = ''X''}}. This is the case if and only if {{nowrap|1=''G''⋅''x'' = ''X''}} for ''all'' ''x'' in ''X''.

The set of all orbits of ''X'' under the action of ''G'' is written as ''X''/''G'' (or, less frequently: ''G''\''X''), and is called the ''quotient'' of the action. In geometric situations it may be called the ''{{visible anchor|orbit space}}'', while in algebraic situations it may be called the space of ''{{visible anchor|coinvariants}}'', and written ''X&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'',  by contrast with the invariants (fixed points), denoted ''X&lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;'': the coinvariants are a ''quotient'' while the invariants are a ''subset.'' The coinvariant terminology and notation are used particularly in [[group cohomology]] and [[group homology]], which use the same superscript/subscript convention.

===Invariant subsets===
If ''Y'' is a [[subset]] of ''X'', we write ''GY'' for the set {{nowrap|{ ''g''⋅''y'' : ''y'' ∈ ''Y'' and ''g'' ∈ ''G''}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}}. We call the subset ''Y'' ''invariant under G'' if {{nowrap|1=''G''⋅''Y'' = ''Y''}} (which is equivalent to {{nowrap|''G''⋅''Y'' ⊆ ''Y''}}). In that case, ''G'' also operates on ''Y'' by restricting the action to ''Y''. The subset ''Y'' is called ''fixed under G'' if {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''y'' = ''y''}} for all ''g'' in ''G'' and all ''y'' in ''Y''. Every subset that is fixed under ''G'' is also invariant under ''G'', but not vice versa.

Every orbit is an invariant subset of ''X'' on which ''G'' acts [[Group action#Types of actions|transitively]]. The action of ''G'' on ''X'' is ''transitive'' if and only if all elements are equivalent, meaning that there is only one orbit.

A ''G-invariant'' element of ''X'' is {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''X''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''x''}} for all {{nowrap|''g'' ∈ ''G''}}. The set of all such ''x'' is denoted ''X&lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;'' and called the ''G-invariants'' of ''X''. When ''X'' is a [[G-module|''G''-module]], ''X&lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the zeroth [[group cohomology]] group of ''G'' with coefficients in ''X'', and the higher cohomology groups are the [[derived functor]]s of the [[functor]] of ''G''-invariants.

===Fixed points and stabilizer subgroups===
Given ''g'' in ''G'' and ''x'' in ''X'' with {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''x''}}, we say ''x'' is a fixed point of ''g'' and ''g'' fixes ''x''.

For every ''x'' in ''X'', we define the ''stabilizer subgroup'' of ''G'' with respect to ''x'' (also called the ''isotropy group'' or ''little group''&lt;ref name="Procesi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Procesi|first1=Claudio|title=Lie Groups: An Approach through Invariants and Representations|date=2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780387289298|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sl8OAGYRz_AC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22little+group%22+action&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP0P3X5qbSAhXriFQKHfNLDDsQ6AEIODAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22little%20group%22%20action&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as the set of all elements in ''G'' that fix ''x'':
:&lt;math&gt;G_x = \{g \in G \mid g \cdot x = x\}.&lt;/math&gt;
This is a [[subgroup]] of ''G'', though typically not a normal one. The action of ''G'' on ''X'' is [[Group action#Types of actions|free]] if and only if all stabilizers are trivial. The kernel ''N'' of the homomorphism with the symmetric group, {{nowrap|''G'' → Sym(''X'')}}, is given by the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the stabilizers ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' for all ''x'' in ''X''. If ''N'' is trivial, the action is said to be faithful (or effective).

Let ''x'' and ''y'' be two elements in ''X'', and let ''g'' be a group element such that {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''g''⋅''x''}}. Then the two stabilizer groups ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''G&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' are related by {{nowrap|1=''G&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''g'' ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Proof: by definition, {{nowrap|''h'' &amp;isin; ''G&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''}} if and only if {{nowrap|1=''h''⋅(''g''⋅''x'') = ''g''⋅''x''}}. Applying ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to both sides of this equality yields {{nowrap|1=(''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''hg'')⋅''x'' = ''x''}}; that is, {{nowrap|''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''hg'' &amp;isin; ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. An opposite inclusion follows similarly by taking {{nowrap|''h'' &amp;isin; ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and supposing {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''y''}}.

The above says that the stabilizers of elements in the same orbit are [[Conjugacy class|conjugate]] to each other. Thus, to each orbit, one can associate a conjugacy class of a subgroup of ''G'' (i.e., the set of all conjugates of the subgroup). Let &lt;math&gt;(H)&lt;/math&gt; denote the conjugacy class of ''H''. Then one says that the orbit ''O'' has type &lt;math&gt;(H)&lt;/math&gt; if the stabilizer &lt;math&gt;G_x&lt;/math&gt; of some/any ''x'' in ''O'' belongs to &lt;math&gt;(H)&lt;/math&gt;. A maximal orbit type is often called a [[principal orbit type]].

==={{visible anchor|Orbit-stabilizer theorem}} and Burnside's lemma===
Orbits and stabilizers are closely related. For a fixed &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, consider the map &lt;math&gt;G\to X&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;g \mapsto g\cdot x&lt;/math&gt;. This map induces a bijection from the set &lt;math&gt;G/G_x&lt;/math&gt; of  [[coset]]s of &lt;math&gt;G_x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to the orbit &lt;math&gt;G\cdot x&lt;/math&gt;, as the translate &lt;math&gt;g\cdot x&lt;/math&gt; depends only on the left coset &lt;math&gt;gG_x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Artin, &lt;em&gt;Algebra&lt;/em&gt;, Proposition 6.4 on p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;. This result is known as the ''orbit-stabilizer theorem''. 

If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is finite then the orbit-stabilizer theorem, together with [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]], gives
:&lt;math&gt;|G\cdot x| = [G\,:\,G_x] = |G| / |G_x|.&lt;/math&gt;

This result is especially useful since it can be employed for counting arguments (typically in situations where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is finite as well).

[[File:Labeled cube graph.png|thumb|Cubical graph with vertices labeled]]
: '''Example:'''  One can use the orbit-stabilizer theorem to count the automorphisms of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. Consider the [[cubical graph]] as pictured, and let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; denote its [[Graph automorphism|automorphism]] group. Then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acts on the set of vertices &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,\ldots,8\}&lt;/math&gt;, and this action is transitive as can be seen by composing rotations about the center of the cube. Thus, by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, we have that &lt;math&gt;|G| = |G\cdot1||G_1| = 8|G_1|&lt;/math&gt;. Applying the theorem now to the stabilizer &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain &lt;math&gt;|G_1| = |(G_1)\cdot2||(G_1)_2|&lt;/math&gt;. Any element of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that fixes &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; must send &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; to either &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt;. There are such automorphisms; consider for example the map that transposes &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;, transposes &lt;math&gt;6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;8&lt;/math&gt;, and fixes the other vertices. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\left|(G_1)\cdot2\right| = 3&lt;/math&gt;. Applying the theorem a third time gives &lt;math&gt;|(G_1)_2| = |((G_1)_2)\cdot3||((G_1)_2)_3|&lt;/math&gt;. Any element of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that fixes &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; must send &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; to either &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;6&lt;/math&gt;, and one easily finds such automorphisms. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\left|((G_1)_2)\cdot3\right| = 2&lt;/math&gt;. One also sees that &lt;math&gt;((G_1)_2)_3&lt;/math&gt; consists only of the identity automorphism, as any element of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; fixing &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; must also fix &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; and consequently all other vertices. Combining the preceding calculations, we now obtain &lt;math&gt;|G| = 8\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1 = 48&lt;/math&gt;.

A result closely related to the orbit-stabilizer theorem is [[Burnside's lemma]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\left|X/G\right|=\frac{1}{\left|G\right|}\sum_{g\in G}\left|X^g\right|&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;X^g&lt;/math&gt; the set of points fixed by &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. This result is mainly of use when &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are finite, when it can be interpreted as follows: the number of orbits is equal to the average number of points fixed per group element.

Fixing a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, the set of formal differences of finite &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-sets forms a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] called the [[Burnside ring]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, where addition corresponds to [[disjoint union]], and multiplication to [[Cartesian product]].

== Examples ==
* The ''{{visible anchor|trivial}}'' action of any group ''G'' on any set ''X'' is defined by {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''x''}} for all ''g'' in ''G'' and all ''x'' in ''X''; that is, every group element induces the [[identity function|identity permutation]] on ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eie &amp; Chang |title=A Course on Abstract Algebra|year=2010|url={{Google books|plainurl=y|id=jozIZ0qrkk8C|page=144|text=trivial action}}|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In every group ''G'', left multiplication is an action of ''G'' on ''G'': {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''gx''}} for all ''g'', ''x'' in ''G''. This action forms the basis of a rapid proof of [[Cayley's theorem]] - that every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group of permutations of the set ''G''.
* In every group ''G'' with subgroup ''H'', left multiplication is an action of ''G'' on the set of cosets ''G/H'': {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''aH'' = ''gaH''}} for all ''g'',''a'' in ''G''. In particular if H contains no nontrivial normal subgroups of ''G'' this induces an isomorphism from ''G'' to a subgroup of the permutation group of degree ''[G : H]''.
* In every group ''G'', [[inner automorphism|conjugation]] is an action of ''G'' on ''G'': {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''gxg''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. An exponential notation is commonly used for the right-action variant: {{nowrap|1=''x&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''xg''}}; it satisfies ({{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''gh''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.
* In every group ''G'' with subgroup ''H'', [[inner automorphism|conjugation]] is an action of ''G'' on conjugates of ''H'': {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''K'' = ''gKg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''}} for all ''g'' in ''G'' and ''K'' conjugates of ''H''.
* The [[symmetric group]] S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and its [[subgroup]]s act on the set {{nowrap|{ 1, …, ''n'' }&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} by permuting its elements
* The [[symmetry group]] of a [[polyhedron]] acts on the set of vertices of that polyhedron. It also acts on the set of faces or the set of edges of the polyhedron.
* The symmetry group of any geometrical object acts on the set of points of that object.
* The [[automorphism group]] of a [[vector space]] (or [[graph theory|graph]], or group, or [[ring (algebra)|ring]]…) acts on the vector space (or set of vertices of the graph, or group, or ring…).
* The [[general linear group]] {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''K'')}} and its subgroups, particularly its [[Lie subgroup]]s (including the [[special linear group]] {{nowrap|SL(''n'', ''K'')}}, [[orthogonal group]] {{nowrap|O(''n'', ''K'')}}, special orthogonal group {{nowrap|SO(''n'', ''K'')}}, and [[symplectic group]] {{nowrap|Sp(''n'', ''K'')}}) are [[Lie group]]s that act on the [[vector space]] ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. The group operations are given by multiplying the matrices from the groups with the vectors from ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.
* The [[general linear group]] {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''Z''')}} acts on '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; by natural matrix action. The orbits of its action are classified by the greatest common divisor of coordinates of the vector in '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.
* The [[affine group]] acts [[#Types of actions|transitively]] on the points of an [[affine space]], and the subgroup V of the affine group (i.e., a vector space) transitive and free (i.e., ''regular'') action on these points;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geometry and topology|last=Reid|first=Miles|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780521613255|location=Cambridge, UK New York|pages=170|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; indeed this can be used to give a definition of an [[Affine space#Definition|affine space]].
* The [[projective linear group]] {{nowrap|PGL(''n'' + 1, ''K'')}} and its subgroups, particularly its Lie subgroups, which are Lie groups that act on the [[projective space]] '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;(''K''). This is a quotient of the action of the general linear group on projective space. Particularly notable is {{nowrap|PGL(2, ''K'')}}, the symmetries of the projective line, which is sharply 3-transitive, preserving the [[cross ratio]]; the [[Möbius group]] {{nowrap|PGL(2, '''C''')}} is of particular interest.
*The [[Isometry|isometries]] of the plane act on the set of 2D images and patterns, such as [[wallpaper group|wallpaper pattern]]s. The definition can be made more precise by specifying what is meant by image or pattern; e.g., a function of position with values in a set of colors. Isometries are in fact one example of affine group (action).{{dubious|reason=The isometries of a space are a subgroup of the affine group of that space, but not an affine group in themselves|date=March 2015}}
*The sets acted on by a group G comprise the category of G-sets in which the objects are G-sets and the morphisms are G-set homomorphisms: functions {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅(''f''(''x'')) = ''f''(''g''⋅''x'')}} for every ''g'' in ''G''.
* The [[Galois group]] of a [[field extension]] ''L''/''K'' acts on the field L but has only a trivial action on elements of the subfield K. Subgroups of Gal(L/K) correspond to subfields of L that contain K, i.e., intermediate field extensions between L and K.
* The additive group of the [[real number]]s {{nowrap|('''R''', +)}} acts on the [[phase space]] of "[[well-behaved]]" systems in [[classical mechanics]] (and in more general [[dynamical systems]]) by [[time translation]]: if ''t'' is in '''R''' and ''x'' is in the phase space, then ''x'' describes a state of the system, and {{nowrap|''t'' + ''x''}} is defined to be the state of the system ''t'' seconds later if ''t'' is positive or &amp;minus;''t'' seconds ago if ''t'' is negative.
*The additive group of the real numbers {{nowrap|('''R''', +)}} acts on the set of real functions of a real variable in various ways, with (''t''⋅''f'')(''x'') equal to, e.g., {{nowrap|''f''(''x'' + ''t'')}}, {{nowrap|''f''(''x'') + ''t''}}, {{nowrap|''f''(''xe&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;'')}}, {{nowrap|''f''(''x'')''e&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, {{nowrap|''f''(''x'' + ''t'')''e&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, or {{nowrap|''f''(''xe&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;'') + ''t''}}, but not {{nowrap|''f''(''xe&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;'' + ''t'')}}.
*Given a group action of ''G'' on ''X'', we can define an induced action of ''G'' on the [[power set]] of ''X'', by setting {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''U'' = {''g''⋅''u'' : ''u'' ∈ ''U''}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} for every subset ''U'' of ''X'' and every ''g'' in ''G''. This is useful, for instance, in studying the action of the large [[Mathieu group]] on a 24-set and in studying symmetry in certain models of [[finite geometry|finite geometries]].
* The [[quaternions]] with [[Norm of a quaternion|norm]] 1 (the [[versor]]s), as a multiplicative group, act on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;: for any such quaternion {{nowrap|1=''z'' = cos ''α''/2 + '''v''' sin ''α''/2}}, the mapping {{nowrap|1=''f''('''x''') = ''z'''''x'''''z''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a counterclockwise rotation through an angle ''α'' about an axis given by a unit vector '''v'''; ''z'' is the same rotation; see [[quaternions and spatial rotation]].

== Group actions and groupoids ==
The notion of group action can be put in a broader context by using the ''action [[groupoid]]'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle G' \;=\;  G \,\ltimes\, X&lt;/math&gt;  associated to the group action, thus allowing techniques from groupoid theory such as presentations and [[fibration]]s. Further the stabilizers of the action are the vertex groups,  and the orbits of the action are the components, of the action groupoid. For more details, see the book ''Topology and groupoids'' referenced below.

This action groupoid comes with a morphism &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle p:\; G' \,\rightarrow\, G&lt;/math&gt; which is a ''covering morphism of groupoids''. This allows a relation between such morphisms and [[covering maps]] in topology.

== Morphisms and isomorphisms between ''G''-sets ==
If ''X'' and ''Y'' are two ''G''-sets, we define a ''[[morphism]]'' from ''X'' to ''Y'' to be a function {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''f''(''g''⋅''x'') = ''g''⋅''f''(''x'')}} for all ''g'' in ''G'' and all ''x'' in ''X''. Morphisms of ''G''-sets are also called ''[[equivariant map]]s'' or ''G-maps''.

The composition of two morphisms is again a morphism.

If a morphism ''f'' is [[bijective]], then its inverse is also a morphism, and we call ''f'' an ''[[isomorphism]]'' and the two ''G''-sets ''X'' and ''Y'' are called ''isomorphic''; for all practical purposes, they are indistinguishable in this case.

Some example isomorphisms:
* Every regular ''G'' action is isomorphic to the action of ''G'' on ''G'' given by left multiplication.
* Every free ''G'' action is isomorphic to {{nowrap|''G'' × ''S''}}, where ''S'' is some set and ''G'' acts on {{nowrap|''G'' × ''S''}} by left multiplication on the first coordinate. (''S'' can be taken to be the set of orbits ''X''/''G''.)
* Every transitive ''G'' action is isomorphic to left multiplication by ''G'' on the set of left [[coset]]s of some [[subgroup]] ''H'' of ''G''. (''H'' can be taken to be the stabilizer group of any element of the original ''G''-set.the original action.)

With this notion of morphism, the collection of all ''G''-sets forms a [[category theory|category]]; this category is a [[Grothendieck topos]] (in fact, assuming a classical metalogic, this topos will even be Boolean).

== Continuous group actions ==
{{main article|continuous group action}}

One often considers ''continuous group actions'': the group ''G'' is a [[topological group]], ''X'' is a [[topological space]], and the map {{nowrap|''G'' × ''X'' → ''X''}} is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] with respect to the [[product topology]] of {{nowrap|''G'' × ''X''}}. The space ''X'' is also called a ''G-space'' in this case. This is indeed a generalization, since every group can be considered a topological group by using the [[discrete space|discrete topology]]. All the concepts introduced above still work in this context, however we define morphisms between ''G''-spaces to be ''continuous'' maps compatible with the action of ''G''. The quotient ''X''/''G'' inherits the [[quotient topology]] from ''X'', and is called the ''quotient space'' of the action. The above statements about isomorphisms for regular, free and transitive actions are no longer valid for continuous group actions.

If ''X'' is a [[Covering map#Deck transformation group, regular covers|regular covering space]] of another topological space ''Y'', then the action of the [[Covering map#Deck transformation group, regular covers|deck transformation group]]  on ''X'' is properly discontinuous as well as being free. Every free, properly discontinuous action of a group ''G'' on a [[path-connected]] topological space ''X'' arises in this manner: the quotient map {{nowrap|''X'' ↦ ''X''/''G''}} is a regular covering map, and the deck transformation group is the given action of ''G'' on ''X''. Furthermore, if ''X'' is simply connected, the fundamental group of ''X''/''G'' will be isomorphic to ''G''.

These results  have been generalized in the book ''Topology and Groupoids'' referenced below to obtain the [[fundamental groupoid]] of the orbit space of a discontinuous action of a discrete group on a Hausdorff space, as,  under reasonable  local conditions, the orbit groupoid of the fundamental groupoid of the space. This allows calculations such as the fundamental group of the [[symmetric square]] of a space ''X'', namely the orbit space of the product of ''X'' with itself under the twist action of the cyclic group of order 2 sending {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}} to {{nowrap|(''y'', ''x'')}}.

An action of a group ''G'' on a [[locally compact space]] ''X'' is ''cocompact'' if there exists a compact subset ''A'' of ''X'' such that {{nowrap|1=''GA'' = ''X''}}. For a properly discontinuous action, cocompactness is equivalent to compactness of the quotient space ''X/G''.

The action of ''G'' on ''X'' is said to be ''proper'' if the mapping {{nowrap|''G'' × ''X'' → ''X'' × ''X''}} that sends {{nowrap|(''g'', ''x'') ↦ (''g⋅x'', ''x'')}} is a [[proper map]].

===Strongly continuous group action and smooth points===
A group action of a topological group ''G'' on a topological space ''X'' is said to be ''strongly continuous'' if for all ''x'' in ''X'', the map {{nowrap|''g'' ↦ ''g''⋅''x''}} is continuous with respect to the respective topologies. Such an action induces an action on the space of continuous functions on ''X'' by defining {{nowrap|1=(''g''⋅''f'')(''x'') = ''f''(''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''x'')}} for every ''g'' in ''G'', ''f'' a continuous function on ''X'', and ''x'' in ''X''. Note that, while every continuous group action is strongly continuous, the converse is not in general true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The subspace of ''smooth points'' for the action is the subspace of ''X'' of points ''x'' such that {{nowrap|''g'' ↦ ''g''⋅''x''}} is smooth; i.e., it is continuous and all derivatives{{where|date=August 2013}} are continuous.

== Variants and generalizations ==
One can also consider actions of [[monoid]]s on sets, by using the same two axioms as above. This does not define bijective maps and equivalence relations however. See [[semigroup action]].

Instead of actions on sets, one can define actions of groups and monoids on objects of an arbitrary [[category theory|category]]: start with an object ''X'' of some category, and then define an action on ''X'' as a monoid homomorphism into the monoid of endomorphisms of ''X''. If ''X'' has an underlying set, then all definitions and facts stated above can be carried over. For example, if we take the category of [[vector space]]s, we obtain [[group representation]]s in this fashion.

One can view a group ''G'' as a category with a single object in which every [[morphism]] is invertible. A (left) group action is then nothing but a (covariant) [[functor]] from ''G'' to the [[category of sets]], and a group representation is a functor from ''G'' to the [[category of vector spaces]]. A morphism between G-sets is then a [[natural transformation]] between the group action functors.  In analogy, an action of a [[groupoid]] is a functor from the groupoid to the category of sets or to some other category.

In addition to [[continuous group action|continuous actions]] of topological groups on topological spaces, one also often considers [[Lie group action|smooth actions]] of [[Lie groups]] on [[manifold|smooth manifold]]s, regular actions of [[algebraic group]]s on [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]], and [[group-scheme action|actions]] of [[group scheme]]s on [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]]. All of these are examples of [[group object]]s acting on objects of their respective category.

'''Guy Louis Debord''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|b|ɔr}}; {{IPA-fr|gi dəbɔʁ|lang}}; 28 December 1931 – 30 November 1994) was a French [[Marxist]] theorist, philosopher, [[filmmaker]], member of the [[Letterist International]], founder of a Letterist faction, and founding member of the [[Situationist International]] (SI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/14/Dead_Bored_Debords_Dead|title=Dead Bored: Debord's Dead!  Andrew Hussey on the death of a turbulent thinker|last=|first=|date=|website=Philosophynow.org|publisher=|access-date=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also briefly a member of ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]''.

==Early life==
Guy Debord (also known as "Debord Guy") was born in [[Paris, France|Paris]] in 1931. Debord's father, Martial, was a pharmacist who died due to illness when Debord was young. Debord's mother, Paulette Rossi, sent Guy to live with his grandmother in her family villa in Italy. During World War II, the Rossis left the villa and began to travel from town to town. As a result, Debord attended high school in Cannes, where he began his interest in film and [[vandalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bourseiller, Christophe. "Vie et Mort de Guy Debord". Agora.&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man, Debord actively opposed the [[Algerian War|French war in Algeria]] and joined in demonstrations in Paris against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notbored.org/guillaume.html|title=Pierre Guillaume Remembers Guy Debord|website=Notbored.org|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debord studied Law at the University of Paris, but left early and did not complete his university education. After ending his stint at the University of Paris, he began his career as a writer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guy Debord, Concept of the Spectacle|last=Jappe|first=A|publisher=Berkely, CA: University of California Press.|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Involvement with the Letterists ==
Debord joined the [[Lettrism|Letterist International]] when he was 19. The Letterists were led dictatorially by [[Isidore Isou]] until a widely agreed upon schism ended Isou's authority. This schism gave rise to several factions of Letterists, one of which was decidedly led by Debord upon Gil Wolman's unequivocal recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;Bourseiller, ibid&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, Debord led the [[Situationist International]] group, which influenced the Paris Uprising of [[May 1968 in France|1968]], during which he took part in the occupation of the Sorbonne. Some consider his book ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1967) to be a catalyst for the uprising,&lt;ref&gt;Andreotti, L. "Review: Leaving the twentieth century: The Situationist International." ''Journal of Architectural Education, 49''(3), p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; although perhaps a more immediately significant text was [[Mustapha Khayati]]'s "[[On the Poverty of Student Life]]", published in November 1966.

==Founding of the Situationist International==
In 1957, the Letterist International, the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]], and the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] gathered in Cosio d'Arroscia (Cuneo), Italy, to found the Situationist International, with Debord having been the leading representative of the Letterist delegation. Initially made up of a number of well-known artists such as Asger Jorn and Pinot Gallizio, the early days of the SI were heavily focused on the formulation of a critique of art, which would serve as a foundation for the group's future entrance into further political critiques. The SI was known for a number of its interventions in the art world, which included one raid against an international art conference in Belgium during 1958&lt;ref&gt;Internationale Situationniste No. 1, June 1958, pages 29-30,&lt;/ref&gt; that included a large pamphlet drop and significant media coverage, all of which culminated in the arrest of various situationists and sympathizers associated with the scandal. In addition to this action, the SI endeavored to formulate industrial painting, or, painting prepared en masse with the intent of defaming the original value largely associated with the art of the period. In the course of these actions, Debord was heavily involved in the planning and logistical work associated with preparing these interventions, as well as the work for ''Internationale Situationniste'' associated with theoretical defense of the Situationist International's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Debord, Guy. ''Correspondence: The Founding of the Situationist International. ''Semiotext(e). 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political phase of the Situationist International==
In the early 1960s Debord began to direct the SI toward an end of its artistic phase, eventually expelling members such as Jorn, Gallizio, Troche, and Constant—the bulk of the "artistic" wing of the SI—by 1965. Having established the situationist critique of art as a social and political critique, one not to be carried out in traditional artistic activities, the SI began, due in part to Debord's contributions, to pursue a more concise theoretical critique of capitalist society along Marxist lines.

With Debord's 1967 work, ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'', and excerpts from the group's journal, ''Internationale Situationniste'', the Situationists began to formulate their theory of the spectacle, which explained the nature of late capitalism's historical decay. In Debord's terms, situationists defined the spectacle as an assemblage of social relations transmitted via the imagery of class power, and as a period of capitalist development wherein "all that was once lived has moved into representation".{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} With this theory, Debord and the SI would go on to play an influential role in the [[May 1968 events in France|revolts of May 1968 in France]], with many of the protesters drawing their slogans from Situationist tracts penned or influenced by Debord.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the Situationist International==
[[File:In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni.JPG|thumb|left|Published by [[Éditions Gérard Lebovici]] (1990)]]
In 1972, Debord disbanded the Situationist International after its original members, including [[Asger Jorn]] and [[Raoul Vaneigem]], quit or were expelled. (Vaneigem wrote a biting criticism of Debord and the International.&lt;ref&gt;"The Veritable Split in the SI", 1972&lt;/ref&gt;) Debord then focused on filmmaking with financial backing from the movie mogul and publisher, [[Gérard Lebovici]] (éditions [[Champ Libre]]), until Lebovici's mysterious death. Debord was suspected of Lebovici's murder. Distraught by the accusations and his friend's death, Debord took his films and writings out of production until after his death. He had agreed to have his films released posthumously at the request of the American researcher, [[Thomas Y. Levin]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Debord, "Reflections of the Death of Gérard Lebovici"&lt;/ref&gt; Debord's two most recognized films are ''[[The Society of the Spectacle (film)|Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1973) and "{{Interlanguage link multi|In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni|fr}}" (1978).

After dissolving the Situationist International, Debord spent his time reading, and occasionally writing, in relative isolation in a cottage at Champot with Alice Becker-Ho, his second wife. He continued to correspond on political and other issues, notably with Lebovici and the Italian situationist [[Gianfranco Sanguinetti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notbored.org/debord.html|title=Guy Debord|website=Notbored.org|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He focused on reading material relating to war strategies, e.g. [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]] and [[Sun Tzu]], and he designed a [[A Game of War|war game]] with [[Alice Becker-Ho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.fr/dp/2070776514 |title=Le Jeu de la Guerre: RelevÃ© des positions successives de toutes les forces au cours d'une partie - Guy Debord, Alice Becker-Ho - Livres |website=Amazon.fr |date= |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debord married twice, first to [[Michèle Bernstein]] and then [[Alice Becker-Ho]]. Debord had affairs with other women, including [[Michèle Mochot-Bréhat]]. Bernstein wrote a vaguely fictional but detailed account of the open relationships Mochot and she had with Debord in her novel ''All The King's Horses''.

== Death ==
Just before Debord's death, he filmed (although did not publish) a documentary, "Son art et son temps" ("His Art and His Times"), an autobiography of sorts that focused primarily on social issues in Paris in the 1990s. It has been suggested that his dark depiction of this period was a suicide note of sorts. Both Debord's depression and alcohol consumption had become problematic, resulting in a form of [[neuritis|polyneuritis]]. Perhaps in order to end the suffering caused by these conditions, Debord committed suicide by shooting himself in the head (or possibly heart) on 30 November 1994. This was not the first time he attempted to end his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guy Debord and the Situationist International|last=McDonough|first=|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his involvement with the radical [[Situationist International]] (SI), as well as his sadness at 'the society as a spectacle' being considered a cliché in later life, many think that Debord felt hopeless about the very society he was trying to shed light on. Debord was said to be "victim of the Spectacle he fought".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/aug/25/biography.highereducation1|title=The Game of War: The Life and Death of Guy Debord|last=Baker|first=|date=August 2001|website=|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many commentaries on Debord's demise, one scholar noted: "Guy Debord did not kill himself.

Guy Debord's best known works are his theoretical books, ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and ''[[Comments on the Society of the Spectacle]]''. In addition to these he wrote a number of autobiographical books including ''Mémoires'', ''Panégyrique'', ''Cette Mauvaise Réputation...'', and ''Considérations sur l'assassinat de [[Gérard Lebovici]]''. He was also the author of numerous short pieces, sometimes anonymous, for the journals ''Potlatch'', ''Les Lèvres Nues'', ''Les Chats Sont Verts'', and ''Internationale Situationniste''. The [[The Society of the Spectacle|''Society of the spectacle'']] was written in an "interesting prose", unlike most writings in that time or of that nature. For Debord, the Spectacle is viewed as false representations in our real lives. The [[Spectacle (critical theory)|Spectacle]] is a materialized worldview. The spectacle 'subjects human beings to itself'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Society of the Spectacle|last=Debord|first=Guy|publisher=Canberra : Hobgoblin Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debord was deeply distressed by the [[Cultural hegemony|hegemony]] of governments and media over everyday life through mass production and consumption. He criticized both the [[capitalism]] of the West and the dictatorial [[communism]] of the Eastern bloc for the lack of autonomy allowed to individuals by both types of governmental structure. Debord postulated that [[Marx's theory of alienation|Alienation]] had gained a new relevance through the invasive forces of the '[[Spectacle (critical theory)|spectacle]]' - "a social relation between people that is mediated by images" consisting of [[mass media]], [[Advertising|advertisement]], and [[popular culture]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The spectacle is a self-fulfilling control mechanism for society. Debord's analysis developed the notions of "[[reification (Marxism)|reification]]" and [[commodity fetishism|"fetishism of the commodity"]] pioneered by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Georg Lukács]]. [[Semiotics of culture|Semiotics]] was also a major influence, particularly the work of his contemporary, Roland Barthes, who was the first to envisage bourgeois society as a spectacle, and to study in detail the political function of fashion within that spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Sollers "L'antifascisme de Barthes", Le Monde // Hors-Série Roland Barthes, Juillet-Août, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Debord's analysis of "the spectaclist society" probed the historical, economic, and psychological roots of the media and popular culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Central to this school of thought was the claim that alienation is more than an emotive description or an aspect of individual psychology: rather, it is a consequence of the mercantile form of social organization that has reached its climax in capitalism, as theorized by [[Herbert Marcuse]] of the [[Frankfurt School]]. 
{{Libertarian socialism |expanded=People}}
The Situationist International (SI), a political/artistic movement organized by Debord and his colleagues and represented by a journal of the same name, attempted to create a series of strategies for engaging in class struggle by reclaiming individual autonomy from the spectacle. These strategies, including "[[dérive]]" and "[[détournement]]," drew on the traditions of [[Lettrism]]. As founder of the SI, it has been suggested that Debord felt driven to generalize and define the values, ideas, and characteristics of the entire group, which may have contributed to his hand-picking and expulsion of members. The hierarchical and dictatorial nature of the SI existed, however, in the groups that birthed it, including the Letterists and the Surrealists.

Debord's first book, ''[[Mémoires]]'', was bound with a [[sandpaper]] cover so that it would damage other books placed next to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newshelton.com/wet/dry/?p=10356 |title=the new shelton wet/dry |website=Newshelton.com |date=10 January 2013 |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debord has been the subject of numerous biographies, works of fiction, artworks, and songs, many of which are catalogued in the bibliography by Shigenobu Gonzalves, "Guy Debord ou la Beauté du Negatif."

Often, it is suggested that Debord was opposed to the creation of art, however, Debord writes in the Situationist International magazine ("Contre le Cinema") that he believes that "ordinary" (quotidian) people should make "everyday" (quotidian) art; art and creation should liberate from the [[Spectacle (critical theory)|spectacle]], from capitalism, and from the banality of everyday life in contemporary society. In "The Society of the Spectacle," Debord argues that it is the price put on art that destroys the integrity of the art object, not the material or the creation itself. It is important to note that Debord does not equate art to "the spectacle."

==Films==

Debord began an interest in film early in his life when he lived in Cannes in the late 1940s. Debord recounted that, during his youth, he was allowed to do very little other than attend films. He said that he frequently would leave in the middle of a film screening to go home because films often bored him. Debord joined the Lettrists just as [[Isidore Isou]] was producing films and the Lettrists attempted to sabotage [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s trip to Paris through negative criticism.

Overall, Debord challenged the conventions of filmmaking; prompting his audience to interact with the medium instead of being passive receivers of information. As a matter of fact, his film ''Hurlements'' exclusively consists of a series of black and white screens and silence with a bit of commentary dispersed throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Howls for Guy Debord|journal=Film Quarterly|volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debord directed his first film, ''[[Hurlements en faveur de Sade]]'' in 1952 with the voices of Michèle Bernstein and Gil Wolman. The film has no images represented; instead, it shows bright white when there is speaking and black when there is not. Long silences separate speaking parts. The film ends with 24 minutes of black silence. People were reported to have become angry and left screenings of this film. The script is composed of quotes appropriated from various sources and made into a montage with a sort of non-linear narrative.

Later, through the financial support of Michèle Bernstein and Asger Jorn, Debord produced a second film, ''Sur le passage de quelques personnes à travers une assez courte unité de temps'', which combined scenes with his friends and scenes from mass media culture. This integration of Debord's world with mass media culture became a running motif climaxing with "The Society of the Spectacle". Debord wrote the book ''The Society of the Spectacle'' before writing the movie. When asked why he made the book into a movie, Debord said, "I don't understand why this surprised people. The book was already written like a script". Debord's last film, "Son Art et Son Temps", was not produced during his lifetime. It worked as a final statement where Debord recounted his works and a cultural documentary of "his time".

== History ==

=== 1940s origins ===
{{See also|Hipster (1940s subculture)|Hip (slang)}}
[[File:Wiliam P. Gottlieb, Portrait of Harry Gibson, New York, ca. July 1948 (LOC gottlieb.11851).jpg|thumb|[[Dixieland|Hot jazz]] artist [[Harry Gibson]] (at the piano), coiner of the word ''hipster'' in the 1940s]]

The term was coined during the [[Jazz Age]], when "hip" emerged as an adjective to describe aficionados of the growing scene.&lt;ref name="TimeJ" /&gt; Although the adjective's exact origins are disputed, some say it was a derivative of "hop", a slang term for [[opium]], while others believe it comes from the West African word ''hipi'', meaning "to open one's eyes".&lt;ref name="TimeJ" /&gt; Another argument suggests the term derives from the practice of lying on one's hip while smoking opium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826388,00.html |title=JAZZ: Drugs &amp; Drums |publisher=TIME |date=1960-05-02 |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate meaning of "hip", attested as early as 1902, is "aware" or "in the know". Conversely, the antonym ''unhip'' connotes those who are unaware of their surroundings, also including those who are opposed to hipness.

Nevertheless, "hip" eventually acquired the common English suffix ''-ster'' (as in ''[[spinster]]'' and ''[[gangster]]''), and "hipster" entered the language.&lt;ref name="TimeJ" /&gt; The first dictionary to list the word is the short glossary "For Characters Who Don't Dig Jive Talk", which was included with [[Harry Gibson]]'s 1944 album, ''Boogie Woogie In Blue''. The entry for "hipsters" defined them as "characters who like hot jazz".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hyzercreek.com/boogie_in_blue.htm|title=Boogie In Blue|work=hyzercreek.com|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not a complete glossary of jive, however, as it included only jive expressions that were found in the lyrics to his songs.
[[File:Zootsuit2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zoot suit|Zoot-suited]] hipsters in the 1940s]]
The same year, [[Cab Calloway]] published ''The New Cab Calloway's Hepster's Dictionary of Jive'', which had no listing for "hipster", and because there was also a 1939 edition of Calloway's Hepster's (an obvious play on "[[Webster's]]") Dictionary, it appears that "[[hepster]]" pre-dates "hipster". The term used in African-American culture was originally spelled "hep," as in [[Cab Calloway]]'s famous song ''(Hep Hep) The Jumpin' Jive'' recorded on July 17, 1939. 'Hep' is also used in ''Mezz Mezzrow'' essential account of underground jazz culture ''Really the Blues'' (published in 1946).

Initially, hipsters were usually middle-class white youths seeking to emulate the lifestyle of the largely black jazz musicians they followed.&lt;ref name="TimeJ" /&gt; In ''The Jazz Scene'' (1959), author [[Eric Hobsbawm]] (originally writing under the pen name Francis Newton) described hipster language—i.e., "jive-talk or hipster-talk"—as "an [[argot]] or [[Cant (language)|cant]] designed to set the group apart from outsiders". This group crucially includes white jazz musicians such as [[Benny Goodman]], [[Al Cohn]], [[Gerry Mulligan]], [[Stan Getz]], [[Mezz Mezzrow]], [[Barney Kessel]], [[Doc Pomus]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Joey Bishop]], [[Chet Baker]], and [[Gene Krupa]] who ought to be counted as some of the true original hipsters as they were instrumental in turning the white world onto jazz and its underground culture in the 1930s and 1940s.

The subculture rapidly expanded, and after [[World War II]], a burgeoning literary scene grew up around it.&lt;ref name="TimeJ" /&gt; [[Jack Kerouac]] described 1940s [[hipster (1940s subculture)|hipsters]] as "rising and roaming America, bumming and hitchhiking everywhere [as] characters of a special spirituality".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.tc/kerouac/beat.html Kerouac, Jack. "About the Beat Generation", (1957), published as "Aftermath: The Philosophy of the Beat Generation" in ''Esquire'', March 1958] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107052429/http://archive.tc/kerouac/beat.html |date=November 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the beginning of his poem ''[[Howl]]'', [[Allen Ginsberg]] mentioned "angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night". In his essay "[[The White Negro]]", [[Norman Mailer]] characterized hipsters as American [[existentialists]], living a life surrounded by death—annihilated by atomic war or strangled by social conformity—and electing instead to "divorce [themselves] from society, to exist without roots, to set out on that uncharted journey into the rebellious imperatives of the self".&lt;ref name="TimeJ" /&gt;

== 21st-century hipsters ==

In early 2000, both ''The New York Times'' and ''Time Out New York'' ran profiles of [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]] without using the term ''hipster''. The ''Times'' referred to "bohemians"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brooklyn Nights Turn Brighter|first=Ann|last=Powers|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 11, 2000|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/11/movies/brooklyn-nights-turn-brighter.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''TONY'' to "arty East Village types".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Bedford Files|journal=Time Out New York|date=February 3–10, 2000|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2003, when ''[[The Hipster Handbook]]'' was published by Williamsburg resident [[Robert Lanham]], the term had come into widespread use in relation to Williamsburg and similar neighborhoods. ''The Hipster Handbook'' described hipsters as young people with "[[Beatle haircut|mop-top haircuts]], swinging retro [[Handbag|pocketbook]]s, talking on [[cell phone]]s, smoking European [[cigarette]]s... strutting in [[platform shoes]] with a [[biography]] of [[Che Guevara]] sticking out of their bags".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lanham, ''The Hipster Handbook'' (2003) p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Lanham further describes hipsters: "You graduated from a liberal arts school whose football team hasn't won a game since the [[Reagan administration]]" and "you have one [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] friend who you always describe as being your 'one Republican friend.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="TimeJ" /&gt; Mark Greif  dates the initial phase of the revival of the term from 1999 to 2003.&lt;ref name="Mark Greif" /&gt;

A similar phenomenon occurred in the United Kingdom, with young workers in the media and digital industries moving into traditional working class areas of London such as [[Hoxton]], [[Spitalfields]], and, particularly, [[Shoreditch]]. The subculture was parodied in the magazine ''[[Shoreditch Twat]]'' (1999) and the television sitcom ''[[Nathan Barley]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://overlycriticalreviews.wordpress.com/2013/04/17/nathan-barley-retrospective-review-charlie-brooker-christopher-morris/ |title=Nathan Barley: A retrospective review, the self-loathing of Charlie Brooker, and the elusiveness of Christopher Morris|work=Overly Critical Reviews|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2005).

In 2008, ''[[Utne Reader]]'' magazine writer Jake Mohan described "[[Hipster hop|hipster rap]]" as "consisting of the most recent crop of MCs and DJs who flout conventional hip-hop fashions, eschewing baggy clothes and gold chains for tight jeans, big sunglasses, the occasional [[keffiyeh]], and other trappings of the hipster lifestyle". He notes that the "old-school hip-hop website Unkut, and [[Jersey City]] rapper Mazzi" have criticized mainstream rappers whom they deem to be [[poseur|posers]] or "fags for copping the [[metrosexual]] appearances of hipster fashion".&lt;ref name=HipsterRap&gt;{{cite web | title=Hipster Rap: The Latest Hater Battleground | first=Jake|last=Mohan | url=http://www.utne.com/arts/hipster-rap-the-latest-hater-battleground.aspx | publisher=[[Utne Reader]] | date=2008-06-13 | accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Prefix Mag'' writer Ethan Stanislawski argues that there are racial elements to the rise of hipster rap. He claims that there "have been a slew of angry retorts to the rise of hipster rap", which he says can be summed up as "white kids want the funky otherness of hip-hop...without all the scary black people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Chicago Reader has hip-hop hipster backlash against hip-hop hipster backlash | first=Ethan|last=Stanislawski | url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/hip-hop-hipster-backlash/19451/ |journal=[[Prefix Magazine]] | date=2008-06-20 | accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article described hipsters thus: "take your grandmother's sweater and [[Bob Dylan]]'s [[Ray-Ban Wayfarer|Wayfarers]], add jean shorts, [[Converse All-Stars]] and a can of [[Pabst Blue Ribbon|Pabst]] and bam—hipster."&lt;ref name="TimeJ" /&gt;

''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' writer Brandon Stosuy noted that "[[heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] has recently conquered a new frontier, making an unexpected crossover into the realm of hipsterdom". He argues that the "current revival seems to be a natural mutation from the hipster fascination with post-punk, noise, and no wave", which allowed even the "nerdiest indie kids to dip their toes into jagged, autistic sounds". He argues that a "byproduct" of this development was an "investigation of a musical culture that many had previously feared or fetishized from afar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Heavy Metal: It's alive and flourishing | first=Brandon|last=Stosuy | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2005/08/heavy_metal.html | publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date=2005-08-19 | accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|While mainstream society of the 2000s (decade) had been busying itself with reality television, dance music, and locating the whereabouts of Britney Spears's underpants, an uprising was quietly and conscientiously taking place behind the scenes. Long-forgotten styles of clothing, beer, cigarettes and music were becoming popular again. [[Retro]] was cool, the environment was precious, and old was the new 'new'. Kids wanted to wear [[Sylvia Plath]]'s cardigans and [[Buddy Holly]]'s glasses—they revelled in the irony of making something so [[nerdy]] so cool. They wanted to live sustainably and eat organic gluten-free grains. Above all, they wanted to be recognised for being different—to diverge from the mainstream and carve a cultural niche all for themselves. For this new generation, style wasn't something you could buy in a department store, it became something you found in a thrift shop, or, ideally, made yourself. The way to be cool wasn't to look like a television star: it was to look like as though you'd never seen television.}}

Christian Lorentzen of ''Time Out New York'' argues that "hipsterism [[commodity fetishism|fetishizes]] the authentic" elements of all of the "fringe movements of the postwar era—Beat, hippie, punk, even grunge", and draws on the "cultural stores of every unmelted ethnicity" and "gay style," and then "regurgitates it with a winking inauthenticity." He claims that this group of "18-to-34-year-olds," who are mostly white, "have defanged, skinned and consumed" all of these influences.&lt;ref name="killthehip" /&gt; Lorentzen says hipsters, "in their present undead incarnation," are "essentially people who think of themselves as being cooler than America," also referring to them as "the assassins of cool." He argues that [[metrosexual]]ity is the hipster appropriation of [[gay culture]], as a trait carried over from their "Emo" phase. He writes that "these [[aesthetics]] are assimilated&amp;mdash;cannibalized&amp;mdash;into a repertoire of meaninglessness, from which the hipster can construct an identity in the manner of a collage, or a shuffled playlist on an [[iPod]]."&lt;ref name="killthehip" /&gt; He also criticizes how the subculture's original menace has long been abandoned and has been replaced with "the form of not-quite-passive aggression called [[wikt:snark#Noun|snark]]".&lt;ref name="killthehip" /&gt;

In a ''[[Huffington Post]]'' article entitled "Who's a Hipster?", Julia Plevin argues that the "definition of 'hipster' remains opaque to anyone outside this self-proclaiming, highly-selective circle". She claims that the "whole point of hipsters is that they avoid labels and being labeled. However, they all dress the same and act the same and conform in their non-conformity" to an "iconic carefully created sloppy vintage look".&lt;ref name="plevin"&gt;{{cite news|title=Who's a Hipster?|first=Julia|last=Plevin|publisher=huffingtonpost.com|date=2008-08-08|accessdate=2014-05-06|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julia-plevin/whos-a-hipster_b_117383.html |newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rob Horning developed a critique of hipsterism in his April 2009 article "The Death of the Hipster" in ''[[PopMatters]]'', exploring several possible definitions for the hipster. He muses that the hipster might be the "embodiment of [[postmodernism]] as a spent force, revealing what happens when pastiche and irony exhaust themselves as aesthetics", or might be "a kind of permanent cultural middleman in hypermediated late capitalism, selling out alternative sources of social power developed by outsider groups, just as the original 'white negros' evinced by [[Norman Mailer]] did to the original, pre-pejorative 'hipsters'&amp;mdash;blacks". Horning also proposed that the role of hipsters may be to "appropriat[e] the new cultural capital forms, delivering them to mainstream media in a commercial form and stripping their inventors ... of the power and the glory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Death of the Hipster | first=Rob|last=Horning | work=[[Pop Matters]] | url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/the-death-of-the-hipster-panel/ | date=2009-04-13 | accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horning argues that the "problem with hipsters" is the "way in which they reduce the particularity of anything you might be curious about or invested in into the same dreary common denominator of how 'cool' it is perceived to be", as "just another signifier of personal identity". Furthermore, he argues that the "hipster is defined by a lack of authenticity, by a sense of lateness to the scene" or the way that they transform the situation into a "self-conscious scene, something others can scrutinize and exploit".

[[File:BywaterKeepOffHipstersStepsB.jpg|thumb|"Hipsters manage to attract a loathing unique in its intensity." –Dan Fletcher, ''Time Magazine''.]]
Dan Fletcher in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' seems to support this theory, positing that stores like [[Urban Outfitters]] have mass-produced hipster [[List of chics|chic]], merging hipsterdom with parts of mainstream culture, thus overshadowing its originators' still-strong alternative art and music scene.&lt;ref name="TimeJ" /&gt; According to Fletcher, "Hipsters manage to attract a loathing unique in its intensity. Critics have described the loosely defined group as smug, full of contradictions and, ultimately, the dead end of Western civilization."&lt;ref name="TimeJ" /&gt;

Elise Thompson, an editor for the LA blog ''LAist'' argues that "people who came of age in the 70s and 80s punk rock movement seem to universally hate 'hipsters'", which she defines as people wearing "expensive 'alternative' fashion[s]", going to the "latest, coolest, hippest bar...[and] listen[ing] to the latest, coolest, hippest band". Thompson argues that hipsters "don't seem to subscribe to any particular philosophy ... [or] ... particular genre of music". Instead, she argues that they are "[[mercenary|soldiers of fortune]] of style" who take up whatever is popular and in style, "appropriat[ing] the style[s]" of past countercultural movements such as punk, while "discard[ing] everything that the style stood for".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Elise|title=Why Does Everyone Hate Hipster Assholes?|date=February 20, 2008|url=http://laist.com/2008/02/20/why_does_everyo.php|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306054749/http://laist.com/2008/02/20/why_does_everyo.php|archivedate=March 6, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing from [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s work and [[Thomas Frank]]'s theories of [[co-optation]], Zeynep Arsel and Craig Thompson argue that in order to segment and [[Cultural appropriation|co-opt]] the indie marketplace, mass media and marketers have engaged in commercial "mythmaking" and contributed to the formation of the contemporary discourse about hipsters.&lt;ref name="Arsel and Thompson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arsel|first1=Zeynep|first2=Craig J.|last2=Thompson|jstor=10.1086/656389|title=Demythologizing Consumption Practices: How Consumers Protect their Field-Dependent Identity Investments From Devaluing Marketplace Myths|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=August 26, 2010|doi=10.1086/656389}}&lt;/ref&gt; They substantiate this argument using a historical [[discourse analysis]] of the term and its use in the popular culture, based on Arsel's dissertation that was published in 2007. Their claim is that the contemporary depiction of hipster is generated through mass media narratives with different commercial and ideological interests. In other words, hipster is less of an objective category, and more of a culturally- and ideologically-shaped and mass-mediated modern mythology that appropriates the [[Indie (music)|indie]] consumption [[Field (Bourdieu)|field]] and eventually turns into a form of [[Social stigma|stigma]]. Arsel and Thompson also interview participants of the indie culture (DJs, designers, writers) to better understand how they feel about being labeled as one. Their findings demonstrate three strategies for dissociation from the hipster [[stereotype]]: aesthetic discrimination, symbolic demarcation, and proclaiming sovereignty. These strategies, empowered by one's status in the indie field (or their [[cultural capital]]) enable these individuals to defend their field dependent cultural investments and tastes from devaluing hipster mythology.

[[File:No Hipsters!.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Humorous and [[passive-aggressive]] "no hipsters" sign at the entrance to a venue.]]
Arsel and Thompson's work seeks to explain why people who are ostensibly fitting the hipster stereotype profusely deny being one: they argue that hipster mythology devalues their tastes and interests and thus they have to socially distinguish themselves from this cultural category and defend their tastes from devaluation. To succeed in denying being a hipster, while looking, acting, and consuming like one, Arsel and Thompson suggest that these individuals demythologize their existing consumption practices by engaging in rhetorics and practices that symbolically differentiate their actions from the hipster [[Stigma (sociological theory)|stigma]].&lt;ref name="Arsel and Thompson"/&gt;

[[Mark Greif]], a founder of ''[[n+1]]'' and an Assistant Professor at [[The New School]], in a ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial, states that "hipster" is often used by youth from disparate economic backgrounds to jockey for [[social status|social position]]. He questions the contradictory nature of the label, and the way that no one thinks of themselves as a hipster: "Paradoxically, those who used the insult were themselves often said to resemble hipsters—they wore the skinny jeans and big eyeglasses, gathered in tiny enclaves in big cities, and looked down on mainstream fashions and 'tourists'." He believes the much-cited difficulty in analyzing the term stems from the fact that any attempt to do so provokes universal anxiety, since it "calls everyone's bluff". Like Arsel and Thompson, he draws from ''[[La Distinction]]'' by [[Pierre Bourdieu]] to conclude:

{{quote|You can see how hipster neighborhoods are crossroads where young people from different origins, all crammed together, jockey for social gain. One hipster subgroup's strategy is to disparage others as "[[liberal arts college]] grads with too much time on their hands"; the attack is leveled at the children of the [[upper middle class]] who move to cities after college with hopes of working in the "creative professions". These hipsters are instantly declassed, reservoired in abject [[internship]]s and ignored in the urban hierarchy—but able to use college-taught skills of classification, collection and appreciation to generate a superior body of [[cultural capital|cultural "cool"]].
They, in turn, may malign the "trust fund hipsters". This challenges the wealthy who possess money, but but lack culture, and convert real capital into "cultural capital" ([[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu's]] most famous coinage), acquiring subculture as if it were ready-to-wear. (Think of Paris Hilton in her trucker hat.) Both groups, meanwhile, look down on the couch-surfing, old-clothes-wearing hipsters who seem most authentic but are also often the most socially precarious—the lower-middle-class young, moving up through style, but with no backstop of parental culture or family capital. They are the bartenders and boutique clerks who wait on their well-to-do peers and wealthy tourists. Only on the basis of their cool clothes can they be "superior": hipster knowledge compensates for economic immobility.&lt;ref name=NYT111310&gt;{{cite news|author1=Mark Greif|title=The Hipster in the Mirror|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/14/books/review/Greif-t.html |accessdate=October 3, 2015 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 12, 2010|quote=All hipsters play at being the inventors or first adopters of novelties: pride comes from knowing, and deciding, what’s cool in advance of the rest of the world}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Greif's efforts puts the term "hipster" into a [[socioeconomic]] framework rooted in the [[Petite bourgeoisie|petite bourgeois]] tendencies of a youth generation unsure of their future social status. The cultural trend is indicative of a social structure with heightened economic anxiety and lessened class mobility.&lt;ref name=NYT111310 /&gt;

'''''Huǒhēiàn''''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]:&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|火|黑|暗}}}}) is an ancient [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] system of [[aesthetics]] believed to serve as the philosophical [[yin and yang|yang]] to [[fengshui]]'s [[yin and yang|yin]]. It was originally described as an art of only theoretical use, although it was eventually adopted as the ''de facto'' alternative to fengshui.

''Huǒhēiàn'' translate as "fire and darkness" in English. This name refers to a passage from the ''[[Book of Burial]]'' of [[Guo Pu]] of the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]]:&lt;ref name="Field" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Qi vapors in the fire, and is lost in the darkness.&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;{{cite web | last = Field | first = Stephen L. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = ''The Zangshu, or Book of Burial''. | work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.trinity.edu/sfield/Fengshui/Zangshu.html | doi = | accessdate = May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike fengshui, ''huǒhēiàn'' values [[diagonal]] and non-orthogonal arrangements, closed spaces, corners, dim lighting, blocked pathways, and [[Chinese jade|jade]] statuettes of snakes (a trademark of the art).

Early practitioners of the aethetic system were considered cruel, brash, and unpleasing to human tastes in their creations.  However, like the dark [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s of [[Gothic architecture]] (believed by some to be a Western [[analogy]] of sorts), ''huǒhēiàn'' grew to mainstream acceptance at various points in [[Chinese history]]. The mixing of the grandiose and unseen blended to give many a feelings of mystery and [[Psychomotor agitation|excitement]].

The art of ''huǒhēiàn'' countermands many of fengshui's stylistic imperatives, such as screen walls facing the main entrance of the house, talismans to ward off evil, and elevated landscapes to the anterior of the house.  Additionally, ''huǒhēiàn'' enjoins against the presence of ponds, pools, wells, or indeed water sources of any kind. In fact, this prohibition was the origin of the now-canonical [[Chinese rock garden]].

'''Irina Stolyarova''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Ирина Столярова''; born 14 February1966 in [[Moscow]]) is an art collector, nonconformist movement expert, art director of Flying in the Wake of Light collection. Her collection is focused on the work of Russian artists of several generations, living both in the home country and in the West; and the first émigrés generation associated with the School of Paris.

==Career==
Stolyarova's collection, ''Flying in the Wake of Light'', collected during the last decade, and not all the Russian artists included are products of Soviet soil. Many are émigrés or children of émigrés, like the formidable [[Pierre Dmitrienko]] (1925–1974), with a biographical background that is more [[Montparnasse]] than [[Arbat]]. Yet the animating genius of the whole is nonetheless a distinctly Russian spirit that, as the Evangelist said, ''bloweth where it listeth'', evidently, even in the desolation of the Soviet epoch. That cogency of purpose is what makes this private collection remarkable; indeed, this is what makes it a private art collection – in the same qualitative, if not quantitative, sense as those built by the Fricks and the Mellons of yesteryear – rather than a selection of pictures decorating the walls of a private house.

Russian art critic [[Alexander Rappaport]], who has contributed one of the essays to ''Flying in the Wake of Light'', wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;«I see at least three aspects that put a small private collection in an advantageous position vis-à-vis large-scale projects and institutions. The first one concerns the new critical numbness in front of a work of art. In different instances the reasons for this silence could be different, but the silence itself seems very symptomatic. In the case of private collections such silence is incongruous, and here we have none of the deafening silence that accompanies portentous suggestiveness of major events. What we have instead are individual voices that we want to hear. The second aspect is the convivial atmosphere that brings together people without any conceptual programme or ritual. Every painting is surrounded by others, they all seem to be close to each other in spirit, and the feeling is that people attracted to these paintings should also form a union of the like-minded, rather than remain an accidental crowd. Browsing through these paintings I recalled a chance encounter I had with the artist Leon Zak in the house of the famous St Petersburg organist Isiah Braudo, and endless conversations with the artist Eduard Steinberg, and friendly meetings with Francisco Infante... All these people suddenly surfaced in my memory as if they were all sitting around the table. A wonderful phenomenon, not unlike déjà vu. A third aspect is about the institutional future of these seemingly accidental collections, which are becoming an increasingly significant element of contemporary art life and increasingly significant counterbalance to major museums, galleries, and festivals. In other words, I see them as sprouts of a new, relatively independent and elitist art milieu».&lt;/blockquote&gt;
'''J.E. Bowlt:''' "The painters represented in the collection of Irina Stoliarova document that alternative tradition, reminding us of the forthright vision, moral courage and artistic integrity of that counter-movement – and of the fact that, in order for any culture to withstand and survive the verdict of ages, it must retain intrinsic values which transcend the immediate social and political perimeters of its particular time and place. The spontaneity, artistry, and mystery of this pictorial polyphony demonstrate that its creators possessed these constant values and that they did, indeed, move beyond their Soviet roots to become an organic part of the contemporary global process. In this respect, the Stoliarova collection is not merely a casual assemblage of various artifacts, but a single celebration of private initiative and the total freedom of aesthetic expression — “Freedom is freedom”, as the poet Vsevolod Nekrasov wrote 

'''A. Borovsky:''' "The Stolyarova's collection has been focused on the work of Russian artists of several generations, living both in the home country and in the West; and the first émigrés generation associated with the School of Paris. The émigré artists in the collection include those who worked in the early post-war decades; many of them were then expressing their individuality in an entirely different way. Irina Stolyarova, however, and it is important to say, is completely indifferent to the political aspects of the artist’s residence. For her, an artist is ‘Russian’ in the broadest sense, to be viewed within a European cultural context. At least, in choosing her artists, she is referencing this European paradigm. I would further say that Irina Stolyarova is not concerned with a conceptual and even less so with a narrative content of a work. The primary object of her interest is painting as a material substance. She is in interested in painting as such, in its entire gamut: all the way from figurative representation to abstract. Her forte is navigating in this material substance of painting moving from “representational density” (the concept of art theorist Yury Tynyanov) to the free-spirited expressions of various forms of abstraction".

[[File:Pirate_Flag.svg|thumb|250px|right|The traditional "Jolly Roger" of [[piracy]]]]

'''Jolly Roger''' is the traditional English name for the [[naval ensign|flags]] flown to identify a [[piracy|pirate ship]] about to attack, during the early 18th century (the later part of the [[Golden Age of Piracy]]).

The flag most commonly identified as the Jolly Roger today, the [[skull and crossbones (symbol)|skull and crossbones]] symbol on a black flag, was used during the 1710s by a number of pirate captains including [[Black Sam Bellamy]], [[Edward England]], and [[John Taylor (pirate)|John Taylor]]. It went on to become the most commonly used pirate flag during the 1720s, although other designs were also in use.

==Origins==

===Name===

Use of the term ''Jolly Roger'' in reference to pirate flags goes back to at least [[Charles Johnson (pirate biographer)|Charles Johnson]]'s ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]],'' published in Britain in 1724.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ou7Bm11IgEC&amp;pg=PR7 |title=Pirates|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson specifically cites two pirates as having named their flag "Jolly Roger": [[Bartholomew Roberts]] in June 1721&lt;ref&gt;Charles Johnson (1724), ''A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates'', p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Francis Spriggs]] in December 1723.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1724), pp. 411–12.&lt;/ref&gt;
While Spriggs and Roberts used the same name for their flags, their flag designs were very different, suggesting that already "Jolly Roger" was a generic term for black pirate flags rather than a name for any single specific design.  Neither Spriggs' nor Roberts' Jolly Roger consisted of a skull and crossbones.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew Roberts' Jolly Roger in June 1721 is simply described as "their black flag," which may or may not be the same Roberts is described as flying earlier on pp. 243–44, the man standing on a Barbadian's head and a Martinican's head. Spriggs' Jolly Roger is described as follows: "a black Ensign was made, which they called ''Jolly Roger'', with the same device that Captain Low carried, ''viz.'' a white Skeliton in the Middle of it, with a Dart in one Hand striking a bleeding Heart, and in the other, an Hour-Glass."&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Hawkins, who was captured by pirates in 1724, reported that the pirates had a black flag bearing the figure of a skeleton stabbing a heart with a spear, which they named "Jolly Roger." This description closely resembles the infamous flag of Edward Teach/Thatch, otherwise known as [[Blackbeard]], who flew a similar design six years prior.&lt;ref name="cordingly117"&gt;David Cordingly (1995). ''Under the Black Flag: The Romance and Reality of Life Among the Pirates'', New York: Random House, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes claimed that the term derives from "Jolie Rouge" ("Pretty Red") in reference to a red flag used by French [[privateer]]s.  This hypothesis is considered a [[false etymology]], as the phrase "Jolie Rouge" in reference to a pirate flag does not appear in any historical sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=Jolly Roger, n. |work=OED Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=June 2016 |accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early reference to "Old Roger" is found in a news report in the ''Weekly Journal or British Gazetteer''  (London,  Saturday, October 19, 1723; Issue LVII, page 2, col. 1):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Parts of the West-Indies.
Rhode-Island, July 26. This Day, 26 of the Pirates taken by his Majesty Ship the ''[[HMS Greyhound|Greyhound]], Captain Solgard'', were executed here. Some of them delivered what they had to say in writing, and most of them said something at the Place of Execution, advising all People, young ones especially, to take warning by their unhappy Fate, and to avoid the crimes that brought them to it. Their black Flag, under which they had committed abundance of Pyracies and Murders, was affix'd to one Corner of the Gallows. It had in it the Portraiture of Death, with an Hour-Glass in one Hand, and a Dart in the other, striking into a Heart, and three Drops of Blood delineated as falling from it. This Flag they called ''Old Roger'', and us'd to say, ''They would live and die under it''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1207A&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=R7450&amp;I=-3&amp;d=No+Match%3BMatch%3BMatches Old Roger is Jolly Roger]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Linquistlist'', [[American Dialect Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{further information|Skull and crossbones (military)|Totenkopf}}

The first recorded uses of the skull-and-crossbones symbol on naval flags date to the 17th century.
It possibly originated among the [[Barbary pirates]] of the period, which would connect the black colour of the Jolly Roger to the Muslim [[Black Standard]] (black flag). But an early reference to Muslim corsairs flying a skull symbol, in the context of a 1625 [[Barbary slave trade|slave raid]] on Cornwall, explicitly refers to the symbol's being shown on a [[Green in Islam|green flag]].&lt;ref&gt;Giles Milton, ''White Gold '' (2004), p. 9:
"The flags on their mainmasts depicted a human skull on a dark green background - the menacing symbol of a new and terrible enemy. It was the third week of July 1625, and England was about to be attacked by the Islamic corsairs of Barbary."&lt;/ref&gt;
There are mentions of [[Francis Drake]]'s flying a black flag as early as 1585, but the historicity of this tradition has been called into question.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Frear Keeler (ed.), ''Sir Francis Drake's West Indian Voyage, 1585-86'' (1981), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DhWfsDLFC34C&amp;pg=PA161#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 161], footnote 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary accounts show [[Peter Easton]] using a plain black flag in 1612; a plain black flag was also used by Captain Martel's pirates in 1716,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Teach]] aka [[Blackbeard]], [[Charles Vane]], and [[Richard Worley]] in 1718,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Johnson, pp. 72, 147, 344.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Howell Davis]] in 1719.

An early record of the skull-and-crossbones design being used on a (red) flag by pirates is found in a December 6, 1687 entry in a log book held by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]. The entry describes pirates using the flag, not on a ship but on land.&lt;ref&gt;BnF, Manuscrit [http://archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cc50290v Français 385], f. 25, digitised on [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b9060640j/f25.image Gallica] ; For a translation in English, see [http://www.bonaventure.org.uk/ed/flags2.htm Pirate Flags] Pirate Mythtory. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050121042925/http://www.bonaventure.org.uk/ed/flags2.htm |date=January 21, 2005 }}: "And we put down our white flag, and raised a red flag with a Skull head on it and two crossed bones (all in white and in the middle of the flag), and then we marched on."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bonnet.gif|thumb|right|upright|1725 woodcut of [[Stede Bonnet]] with a Jolly Roger in [[Captain Charles Johnson|Charles Johnson]]'s ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'']]
17th and 18th century colonial governors usually required privateers to fly a specific version of the British flag, the 1606 Union Jack with a white crest in the middle, also distinguishing them from naval vessels.&lt;ref&gt;David Cordingly (1995). ''Under the Black Flag: The Romance and Reality of Life Among the Pirates'', New York: Random House, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;  Before this time, British privateers such as Sir [[Henry Morgan]] sailed under English colours.&lt;ref name="cordingly117"/&gt;
An early use of a black flag with skull, crossbones, and hourglass is attributed to pirate captain [[Emanuel Wynn]] in 1700, according to a wide variety of secondary sources.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Angus Konstam]], ''Pirates: 1660–1730''; Douglas Botting, ''The Pirates''; {{cite web |url=http://www.bonaventure.org.uk/ed/flags.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115071330/http://www.bonaventure.org.uk/ed/flags.htm |archivedate=2008-01-15 |df= }}; etcetera.&lt;/ref&gt;  Reportedly, these secondary sources are based on the account of Captain John Cranby of HMS ''Poole'' and are verified at the London [[Public Record Office]].

With the end of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] in 1714, many privateers turned to piracy. They still used red and black flags, but now they decorated them with their own designs. Edward England, for example, flew three different flags: from his mainmast the black flag depicted above; from his foremast a red version of the same; and from his ensign staff the English national flag.
Just as variations on the Jolly Roger design existed, red flags sometimes incorporated yellow stripes or images symbolic of death.&lt;ref name="cordingly118"&gt;David Cordingly (1995). ''Under the Black Flag: The Romance and Reality of Life Among the Pirates'', New York: Random House, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Colored pennants and ribbons could also be used alongside flags.

[[Marcus Rediker]] (1987) claims that most pirates active between 1716 and 1726 were part of one of two large interconnected groups sharing many similarities in organisation. He states that this accounts for the "comparatively rapid adoption of the piratical black flag among a group of men operating across thousands of miles of ocean", suggesting that the skull-and-crossbone design became standardized at about the same time as the term ''Jolly Roger'' was adopted as its name. By 1730, the diversity of symbols in prior use had been mostly replaced by the standard design.&lt;ref&gt;cited after [[David Cordingly]] in ''Life Amongst The Pirates'' (1996), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical designs==
The gallery below showing pirate flags in use from 1693 ([[Thomas Tew]]'s) to 1724 ([[Edward Low]]'s) appears in multiple extant works on the history of piracy.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''inter alia,'' Douglas Botting (1978), ''The Pirates'',  Alexandria, VA: TimeLife Books, Inc., pp. 48–49; [[Angus Konstam]] (1999), ''The History of Piracy'', {{ISBN|1-55821-969-2}}, Italy: Lyons Press, pp. 98–101. Some of these flags are verified by contemporary accounts such as Johnson's. As to Low's flag, for instance, Johnson writes, "Low goes aboard of this ship, [the ''Merry Christmas''], assumes the title of admiral, and hoists a black flag, with the figure of death in red, at the main-topmast head." Charles Johnson (1724), ''A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pirates'', ed. by David Cordingly (2002), Globe Pequot, {{ISBN|1-58574-558-8}}, p. 307. Likewise, Bartholomew Roberts' flag is described in the same edition of Johnson, p. 202, thus: "The jack had a man portrayed in it, with a flaming sword in his hand, and standing on two skulls, subscribed A.B.H. and A.M.H."  Roberts' other flag, showing a man and a skeleton holding up an hourglass, appears in an engraving on p. 278 of Johnson's original 1724 text (reproduced [[:File:Bartholomew Roberts.jpg|here]]).  Kennedy's flag is as described by one of his victims, Captain J. Evans of the ''Greyhound Galley'', according to a letter written to Johnson in the second edition of the History (1726), on p. 331 (note, however, that this capture was in 1716, and thus probably does not refer to the same Walter Kennedy who sailed first with [[Bartholomew Roberts|Roberts]] and then on his own account from 1720–23).  For Wynn's flag, see the preceding footnote.  The origin of the flags for Blackbeard, Tew, Every, Condent, Worley and Bonnet are far more obscure.  Ed Foxe believes that the versions of the latter six pirates' Jolly Rogers shown in the secondary sources are taken from an undated, unsourced manuscript in Britain's National Maritime Museum. {{cite web |url=http://www.bonaventure.org.uk/ed/flags.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115071330/http://www.bonaventure.org.uk/ed/flags.htm |archivedate=2008-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All the secondary sources cited in the gallery below are in agreement except as to the background color of Every's flag.

* '''[[John Phillips (pirate)|John Phillips]].'''  At the hanging of two of John Phillips' pirates, the ''[[Boston News-Letter]]'' reported: "At one end of the gallows was their own dark flag, in the middle of which an anatomy, and at one side of it a dart in the heart, with drops of blood proceeding from it; and on the other side an hour-glass."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephens, John R. Stephens |date=2006|title=Captured by Pirates: 22 Firsthand Accounts of Murder and Mayhem on the High Seas|isbn= 0-7607-8537-6|page= 305}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Edward Low]].'''  Low used at least two other flags besides his famous red skeleton. One was "a white Skeliton in the Middle of it, with a Dart in one Hand striking bleeding Heart, and in the other, an Hour-Glass."&lt;ref name="Johnson 1724, p. 411–12"&gt;Johnson (1724), p. 411–12.&lt;/ref&gt;  The other was described by George Roberts, a prisoner of Low's, as a call to council among Low's ships: "a green silk flag with a yellow figure of a man blowing a trumpet on it."&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Francis Spriggs]]''' is reported to have flown a Jolly Roger identical to one of Low's, from whom he had deserted: "a white Skeliton in the Middle of it, with a Dart in one Hand striking bleeding Heart, and in the other, an Hour-Glass."&lt;ref name="Johnson 1724, p. 411–12"/&gt;
* '''[[Walter Kennedy (pirate)|Walter Kennedy]]'''.  The Jolly Roger flag pictured above for Kennedy was flown at his [[ensign]] staff, i.e., at the stern of his ship.  Kennedy also flew a [[Jackstaff|jack]] (at the bow of the ship) and a pennant (a long narrow flag flown from the top of a mast).  Both Kennedy's jack and his pennant had "only the head and cross bones".&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Florida Straits]] pirates'''.  On May 2, 1822, the Massachusetts [[brigantine]] ''Belvidere'' fended off an attack by a pirate [[schooner]] in the [[Florida Strait]].  The pirates "hoisted a red flag with death's head and cross under it".  Neither the pirate schooner's name nor her captain was identified by the ''Belvidere''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1780, a pirate flag was captured in battle off the [[North Africa]]n coast by Lt [[Richard Curry]], who later became an admiral. The flag is red with a yellow skull and crossbones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-16164191 | work=BBC News | title=Rare Jolly Roger goes on display at Portsmouth's navy museum | date=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1783, [[William Falconer (poet)|William Falconer]] reported that the "[t]he colours usually displayed by pirates are laid to be a black field, with a death's head, a battle-axe and hour-glass," but does not state which pirate or pirates allegedly showed this device.&lt;ref&gt;William Falconer (1783), ''An Universal Dictionary of the Marine'', s.v. "Pirate."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in practice==

Pirates did not fly the Jolly Roger at all times.  Like other vessels, pirate ships usually stocked a variety of different flags, and would normally fly [[false colors]] or no colors until they had their prey within firing range.&lt;ref&gt;This practice is considered deceitful today, but in the period of sail it was the standard practice for all ships. There was no other way to approach an enemy or victim on the open sea if they didn't want to fight.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the pirates' intended victim was within range, the Jolly Roger would be raised, often simultaneously with a warning shot.

The flag was probably intended as communication of the pirates' identity, which may have given target ships an opportunity to change their mind and surrender without a fight.  For example, in June 1720 when [[Bartholomew Roberts]] sailed into the harbour at [[Trepassey]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] with black flags flying, the crews of all 22 vessels in the harbour abandoned them in panic.&lt;ref&gt;Burl, Aubery ''Black Bart'' pp. 133–4.&lt;/ref&gt; If a ship then decided to resist, the Jolly Roger was taken down and a red flag was flown, indicating that the pirates intended to take the ship by force and without mercy. In the mid-18th century, [[Richard Hawkins|Sir Richard Hawkins]] confirmed that pirates gave quarter beneath the black flag, while no quarter was given beneath the red flag.&lt;ref&gt;Cordingly, p. 117.  Cordingly cites only one source for pages 116–119 of his text: Calendar of State Papers, Colonial, America and West Indies, volumes 1719–20, no. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In view of these models, it was important for a prey ship to know that its assailant was a pirate, and not a privateer or government vessel, as the latter two generally had to abide by a rule that if a crew resisted, but then surrendered, it could not be executed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An angry pirate therefore posed a greater danger to merchant ships than an angry Spanish coast guard or privateer vessel. Because of this, although, like pirate ships, Spanish coast guard vessels and privateers were almost always stronger than the merchant ships they attacked, merchant ships may have been more willing to attempt resisting these "legitimate" attackers than their piratical counterparts. To achieve their goal of taking prizes without a costly fight, it was therefore important for pirates to distinguish themselves from these other ships also taking prizes on the seas.&lt;ref&gt;p. 10, [http://www.peterleeson.com/Pirational_Choice.pdf "Pirational Choice: The Economics of Infamous Pirate Practices"], Peter T. Leeson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Flying a Jolly Roger was a reliable way of proving oneself a pirate. Just possessing or using a Jolly Roger was considered proof that one was a criminal pirate rather than something more legitimate; only a pirate would dare fly the Jolly Roger, as he was already under threat of execution.&lt;ref&gt;"Ships attacking under the death head's toothy grin were therefore considered criminal and could be prosecuted as pirates. Since pirates were criminals anyway, for them, flying the Jolly Roger was costless. If they were captured and found guilty, the penalty they faced was the same whether they used the Jolly Roger in taking merchant ships or not – the hangman's noose... For legitimate ships, however, things were different. To retain at least a veneer of legitimacy, privateers and Spanish coast guard ships could not sail under pirate colors. If they did, they could be hunted and hanged as pirates." p. 12, Leeson 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the introduction of [[submarines]] in several navies circa 1900, Admiral Sir [[Arthur Knyvet Wilson|Arthur Wilson]], the [[First Sea Lord]] of the British [[Royal Navy]], stated that submarines were "underhanded, unfair, and damned un-English", and that he would convince the British [[Admiralty]] to have the crews of enemy submarines captured during wartime [[hanging|hanged]] as pirates.&lt;ref name=RichardsSmith10&gt;Richards &amp; Smith, ''Onslow's Jolly Roger'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1914, the British submarine {{HMS|E9||6}} successfully torpedoed the German cruiser [[SMS Hela|SMS ''Hela'']].&lt;ref name=Compton62&gt;Compton-Hall, ''Submarines at War 1939–45'', p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Remembering Wilson's statements, commanding officer [[Max Horton]] instructed his submariners to manufacture a Jolly Roger, which was flown from the submarine as she entered port.&lt;ref name=RichardsSmith10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Compton62/&gt; Each successful patrol saw Horton's submarine fly an additional Jolly Roger until there was no more room for flags, at which point Horton had a large Jolly Roger manufactured, onto which symbols indicating ''E9''{{'}}s achievements were sewn.&lt;ref name=Compton62/&gt; A small number of other submarines adopted the practice:&lt;ref name=Compton62/&gt; {{HMS|E12||6}} flew a red flag with the skull and crossbones on return from a foray into the [[Dardanelles]] in June 1915,&lt;ref name=DJsub/&gt; and the first known photograph of the practice was taken in July 1916 aboard {{HMS|H5||6}}.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, ''A Precarious Existence'', p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice restarted during [[World War II]]. In October 1941, following a successful patrol by {{HMS|Osiris|N67|6}}, during which she sank the Italian destroyer [[Italian destroyer Palestro|''Palestro'']], the submarine returned to [[Alexandria]], but was ordered to remain outside the [[Anti-submarine net|boom net]] until the motorboat assigned to the leader of the [[British 1st Submarine Flotilla|1st Submarine Flotilla]] had come alongside.&lt;ref name=DJsub/&gt;&lt;ref name=Admiralty33&gt;Admiralty, ''His Majesty's Submarines'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; The flotilla leader wanted to recognise the boat's achievement, so had a Jolly Roger made and delivered to ''Osiris''.&lt;ref name=Admiralty33/&gt;{{ref|Horton|(I)}} After this, the commanders of submarine flotillas began to hand out the flags to successful submarines.&lt;ref name=Admiralty33/&gt; Although some sources claim that ''all'' British submarines used the flag,&lt;ref name=Sumner&gt;Sumner, ''The Royal Navy 1939–45'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; the practice was not taken up by those submarine commanders who saw it as boastful and potentially inaccurate, as sinkings could not always be confirmed.&lt;ref name=Compton62/&gt; During the war, British submarines were entitled to fly the Jolly Roger on the day of their return from a successful patrol: it would be hoisted as the boat passed the boom net, and remain raised until sunset.&lt;ref name=Admiralty33/&gt;

During the Vietnam war an urgent airfield was needed at [[Quảng Trị]] by the United States forces.  U.S. Seabee Battalions 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 74, 121, and 133 all sent detachments of men and equipment to get the job done.  Those detachments dubbed themselves the Ghost Battalion and chose the Jolly Roger for the Battalion's colors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Naval History and Heritage Command, U.S. Navy Seabee Museum, The Ghost Battalion|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/museums/seabee/explore/civil-engineer-corps-history/the-ghost-battalion.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Jolly Roger Ecuador2006.jpg|thumb|Jolly Roger flags, ships, pirate. Stamp of Ecuador, 2006.]]
The Jolly Roger flag became a cliché of pirate fiction in the 19th century.
The "[[Golden Age of Piracy]]" was over by the mid-18th century, and piracy was widely suppressed by the 1800s, although the problem of [[Barbary pirates]] persisted until the [[French conquest of Algeria]] in 1830.
By the [[Victorian era]], the pirate threat had receded enough for it to become a [[Literary_topos|topos]] of boyish adventure fiction, notably influenced by Stevenson's 1883 ''[[Treasure Island]]''. Gilbert and Sullivan's ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' introduced pirates as comedic characters, and since the later 20th century, pirates sporting the Jolly Roger flag were often depicted as cartoonish or silly characters. [[J.M. Barrie]] also used it as the name of [[Captain Hook]]'s pirate ship in ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''; it was thus used in most adaptations of the character, including [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon A Time]]''.

===In music===
The song "Jolly Roger" appears on the [[Adam and the Ants]] album ''[[Kings of the Wild Frontier]]'' (1980).

[[Kenny Chesney]]'s single "[[Pirate Flag (song)|Pirate Flag]]", from his fourteenth studio album ''[[Life on a Rock]]'' (2013).

On the cover of the [[Iron Maiden]] album, ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (album)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' (2006), a version of a Jolly Roger depicting a helmeted [[Eddie (mascot)|Eddie]] and two [[assault rifles]] instead of bones is displayed hanging from a tank.

Also on the cover of Michael Jackson's ''[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|Dangerous]]'' (1991) album, it can be seen on the left side with the alteration of a skull over two swords.

The re-issued version of the [[Megadeth]] album, ''[[Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!]]'' (1985), shows a stylized Vic Rattlehead skull on top of crossed swords and crossed bones. This was based on Mustaine's original drawing for the cover which the band did not have enough money to produce at the time.

The "pirate" metal band [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]] often references the Jolly Roger and other pirate related themes in their music.

The Pirates, a spinoff of the band [[Johnny Kidd &amp; the Pirates]], released an album called ''Out of their Skulls'' featuring a skull with crossed guitars below it.[http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YS9KRXR1L.jpg]

British [[DJ]] [[Eddie Richards]] released the [[acid house]] hit "Acid Man" in 1988 under Jolly Roger alias.

===In sports===
&lt;!--[[File:Tampa Bay Buccaneers 2014.png|thumb|right|The Tampa Bay Buccaneers' variant of "Calico Jack's" flag]]--&gt;
A number of sports teams have been known to use variations of the Jolly Roger, with one of the best known in current use, an adaptation of [[Calico Jack]]'s pirate flag, with a [[Carnelian (color)|carnelian]] red background instead of the black, being that of the [[National Football League]]'s [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], with an American football over the crossing area of the two swords.

The [[FC St. Pauli#Supporters|supporters]] of [[FC St. Pauli]], a sports club from [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]], best known for its [[association football]] team, have adopted a variation of Richard Worley's flag as their own unofficial emblem. Also, the Jolly Roger is the popular icon of all [[University College Cork]] (Ireland) sports teams.

"Raise the Jolly Roger!" is also used in a statement by the [[Major League Baseball]]'s team [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] announcer [[Greg Brown (broadcaster)|Greg Brown]] when the Pirates win a game.&lt;ref name="Buccos"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://raisethejollyroger.com/2010/04/the-story-behind-raise-the-jolly-roger-told-by-greg-brown-himself/ | title=The story behind Raise the Jolly Roger, told by Greg Brown himself | publisher=''Blog: Raise the Jolly Roger" | date=15 April 2010 | accessdate=7 October 2013 | author=McElhinny, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown has become known for the phrase, his signature call, similar to other sports broadcasters, such as the Cincinnati Reds' announcer [[Marty Brennaman#Cincinnati Reds|Marty Brennamen]]'s phrase ('This one belongs to the Reds'), and former Pirates announcers [[Lanny Frattare]] ("There was no doubt about it!") and [[Bob Prince]], who liked to end Pirates wins with similarly jovial statements.

Another such variation is the [[Oakland Raiders]], it uses a head with facial features, wearing an eye patch and a helmet, crossed swords behind the helmet completes the image.

All these variations are seen as the logos of sporting teams in (Scotland):
* The [[Braehead Paisley Pirates]]/[[Paisley Pirates]] of the [[Scottish National League (ice hockey)|Scottish National League]] and The [[Paisley Buccaneers]] and [[Riversdale Pirates]] of the [[Scottish Recreational Ice Hockey Conference]]
* The [[East Kilbride Pirates]] American football team in [[BAFA Division 1]]
* The [[Edinburgh Buccaneers]] basketball club of the [[Scottish Men's National League]]

The [[South African Football Association]] soccer team [[Orlando Pirates]] also has the classic Jolly Roger as their logo.

The athletic teams of [[East Carolina University]] used a stylized Jolly Roger as one of their logos. This particular variation includes an [[earring]]ed and [[eyepatch]]-wearing skull donning a [[tricorn]] of purple and gold (the school's colors) emblazoned over two crossbones. This logo appears on the [[football helmet|helmets]] of the school's [[East Carolina Pirates football|football]] team, and an elaborate pre-game ritual takes place prior to each home contest wherein a [[flag]] bearing the university's Jolly Roger logo is raised on a special [[flagpole]] located behind the west [[end zone]] prior to the opening [[kickoff (gridiron football)|kickoff]]. Immediately prior to the start of the fourth quarter, the normal (black) Jolly Roger is lowered and replaced with a flag bearing the [[East Carolina University|ECU]] Jolly Roger on a red background, indicating that the [[ECU Pirates|Pirates]] will grant their opponents "[[no quarter]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecupirates.com/trads/ecu-trads.html|title=ECU Pirates Official Athletic Site - Traditions|work=ecupirates.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921084719/http://www.ecupirates.com/trads/ecu-trads.html|archivedate=2013-09-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Blackshirts (American football)|Blackshirts]], the starting defensive unit players for the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football]] team, are represented by a Jolly Roger, somewhat similar to [[Richard Worley]]'s flag but with the skull encased in the team's [[football helmet]]. Additionally, the players and fans often celebrate by "throwing the bones", where they cross the forearms in front of the chest in an 'X' imitating the logo, and the [[student section]] at [[Memorial Stadium, Lincoln]] is known as the 'Boneyard', where the logo is often displayed on banners, signs, and flags in an act of intimidation.

When [[Viktor Korchnoi]] opposed [[Anatoly Karpov]] for the [[World Chess Championship 1978]], he was a defector from the Soviet Union and momentarily stateless; so he played with a miniature Jolly Roger at the chess table.

===Other uses===
[[File:Seashepherd small pt.jpg|thumb|right|Variant version of the Sea Shepherd flag]] 
The flag of the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] is modeled to look like a classic Jolly Roger, with some alterations. the flag has a whale and a dolphin on the skull's forehead, and the crossed longbones are replaced with a crossed trident and a [[Shepherd#The shepherd's crook|shepherd's crook]].

The early development team of the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Macintosh]] used a pirate flag to maintain a "rebellious" spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Pirate_Flag.txt|title=Pirate Flag|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204235542/http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Pirate_Flag.txt|archivedate=2010-12-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before changing to a stylized 'P', the [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party]] used the Jolly Roger as its symbol; it is still used extensively in the Pirate movement. The [[Piratbyrån]] and [[The Pirate Bay]] also use either the skull and crossbones symbol, or derivatives of it, such as the logo of [[Home Taping Is Killing Music]].

'''''Landscape with Two Nymphs''''' is a c.1659 painting by [[Nicolas Poussin]]. A late work, it seems to have been painted for [[Charles Le Brun]], another painter. It was sold from the Radziwiłł collection in 1866 to [[Frédéric Reiset]], a curator at the Louvre. Reiset sold it with the rest of his collection to [[Henri d'Orleans, Duke of Aumale]] in 1879 and so the work is now in the [[Musée Condé]] in Chantilly

In the modern [[Gaelic languages]], '''''Lochlann'''''&amp;nbsp;{{Pronunciation-needed}} signifies [[Scandinavia]] or, more specifically, [[Norway]]. As such it is [[cognate]] with the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name for Scandinavia, '''Llychlyn'''. In both old Gaelic and old Welsh, such names literally mean "land of lakes" or "land of swamps".

[[Classical Gaelic]] literature and other sources from [[Early Medieval Ireland 800–1166|early medieval Ireland]] first featured the name, in earlier forms like '''Laithlind''' and ''' Lothlend'''.  In [[Irish Language|Irish]], the adjectival noun ''Lochlannach'' ("person belonging to Lochlann") has an additional sense of "raider" or, more specifically, a [[viking]].

==Historical uses==
All uses of the word "Lochlann" relate it to Nordic realms of Europe.  While the traditional view has identified Laithlind with [[Norway]], some have preferred to locate it in a Norse-dominated part of [[Scotland]], perhaps the [[Hebrides]] or the [[Northern Isles]].&lt;ref&gt;Woolf (2007) pp. 107–108 &amp; 286–289&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donnchadh Ó Corráin]] states that Laithlinn was the name of [[Viking Scotland]], and that a substantial part of Scotland—the Northern and [[Western Isles]] and large areas of the coastal mainland from [[Caithness]] and [[Sutherland]] to [[Argyll]]—was conquered by the [[Viking expansion|Vikings]] in the first quarter of the ninth century and a Viking kingdom was set up there earlier than the middle of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Corráin (1998) various pages.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Ireland and the ''Suðreyjar''===
[[File:Ardnamurchan sword, by Pieta Greaves.jpg|thumb|An x-ray image of the sword found at the [[Port an Eilean Mhòir ship burial]].]]
The ''[[Fragmentary Annals of Ireland]]'' contain numerous reference to the "Lochlanns", who are clearly Vikings and feared and distrusted by the writers. However relatively few named individuals are identified from amongst their number and their relationships with one another are largely obscure.

[[Tomrair|Jarl Tomrair]], described as the "tanist of the king of Lochlann" fell in the Battle of Sciath Nechtain (near modern [[Castledermot]]) in 848.&lt;ref&gt;''Annals of Ulster'' AU 848.5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 851 Zain, also identified as the "half-king of the Lochlanns"&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan (1860) p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; and Iargna "the two chiefs of the fleet of the Lochlanns" are recorded as fighting against the Danes in [[Carlingford Lough]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan (1860) p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The same source notes that in the sixth year of the reign of [[Máel Sechnaill mac Maíl Ruanaid|Maelsechlainn]], circa 852 [[Amlaíb Conung|Amlaíb]] "the son of the King of Lochlann, came to Erin, and he brought with him commands from his father for many rents and tributes, but he left suddenly. Imhar, his younger brother, came after him to levy the same rents."&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan (1860) pp. 125–27&lt;/ref&gt; Amlaíb is also called the "son of the king of Laithlind" by the ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'' in 853.&lt;ref&gt;''Annals of Ulster'' AU 853.2&lt;/ref&gt; While certainly of Scandinavian origin – Amlaíb is the [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] representation of the [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] name ''Oláfr'' – the question of Amlaíb's immediate origins is debated. In 871 he "went from Erin to Lochlann to wage war on the Lochlanns" to assist his father [[Gofraid of Lochlainn|Goffridh]] who had "come for him".&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan (1860) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OC34&gt;Ó Corráin (1998) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Hona, who the annalists believed was a [[druid]] and Tomrir Torra were "two noble chiefs",  "of great fame among their own people", and "of the best race of the Lochlanns", although their careers appear to have been otherwise unrecorded. They died whilst fighting the men of [[Munster]] in 860.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan (1860) pp. 145–47&lt;/ref&gt;

Gnimbeolu, chief of the Galls of [[Cork (city)|Cork]], was killed in 865, possibly the same person as Gnim Cinnsiolla, chief of the Lochlanns who is recorded as dying in similar circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan (1860) pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; In 869 Tomrark the Earl is described as a "fierce, rough, cruel man of the Lochlanns"&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan (1860) p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; and the annalist notes, perhaps with some satisfaction, that this "enemy of [[Brendan|Brenann]]" died of madness at Port-Mannan (possibly the harbour of the [[Isle of Man]]) in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan (1860) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kong-magnus-berrfott-menn.jpg|200 px|right|thumb|19th-century depiction of Magnus Barefoot's forces in Ireland.]]
Also in 869 the [[Pict]]s were attacked by the Lochlanns and internal strife in Lochlann was recorded because:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the sons of Albdan, King of Lochlann, expelled the eldest son, Raghnall, son of Albdan, because they feared that he would take the kingdom of Lochlann after their father; and Raghnall came with his three sons to [[Orkney|Innsi Orc]] and Raghnall tarried there with his youngest son. But his elder sons, with a great host, which they collected from every quarter, came on to the British Isles, being elated with pride and ambition, to attack the Franks and Saxons. They thought that their father had returned to Lochlann immediately after setting out.&lt;ref name=OD158&gt;O'Donovan (1860) pp. 158–59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This entry provides a number of problems. The demise of Gofraid, King of Lochlann and father of Amlaíb and Imhar (or Ímar) and [[Auisle]]&lt;ref name=D171&gt;O'Donovan (1860) p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; seems to be recorded in the ''Fragmentary Annals'' in 873:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Ég righ Lochlainne .i. Gothfraid do tedmaimm grána opond. Sic quod placuit Deo''. (The death of the king of Lochlainn i.e. Gothfraid of a sudden and horrible fit. So it pleased God.)&lt;ref name=OC36&gt;Ó Corráin (1998) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; O' Corrain (1998) concludes that: "this much-emended entry appears to be the death notice of Gøðrøðr, king of the Vikings in Scotland"&lt;ref&gt;Ó Corráin (1998) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; and although other interpreters believed this entry referred to the death of his son Ímar it is clearly about one of the other.&lt;ref&gt;Todd (1867) p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Who then is "Albdan"? The name is probably a corruption of the Norse Halden, or Halfdane,&lt;ref name=OD158/&gt; and this may be a reference to [[Halfdan the Black]]. This would make Raghnall [[Rognvald Eysteinsson]] of More in Norway and the brother of [[Harald Finehair]] (although the Norse sagas claim that Halfdan was Raghnall/Rognvald's grandfather).&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Lochlanns" may thus have been a generic description for both Norwegian-based warriors and insular forces of Norse descent based in the [[Northern Isles|Norðreyjar]] or [[Hebrides|Suðreyjar]].

Other Lochlannachs mentioned in the texts for dates during the early 10th century are [[Ingimundr (tenth century)|Hingamund]]&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan (1860) p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; (or Ingimund) and Otter, son of Iargna, who was killed by the Scots.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan (1860) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the meaning of Laithlind and Lochlann in Ireland in the ninth and tenth centuries, it may have referred to [[Norway]] later.  In 1058 [[Magnus II of Norway|Magnus Haraldsson]] is called "the son of the king of Lochlann", and his nephew [[Magnus Barefoot]] is the "king of Lochlann" in the Irish πreports of the great western expedition four decades later.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Annals of Tigernach]]'', s.a. 1058, s.a 1102; Woolf (2007) pp. 266–267.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish Lochlann has a cognate in the [[Welsh language]] ''Llychlyn'', which appears as a name for Scandinavia in the prose tales ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'' and ''[[The Dream of Rhonabwy]]'', and in some versions of [[Welsh Triad]] 35.&lt;ref name="Bromwich88"&gt;Bromwich, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; In these versions of Triad 35 ''Llychlyn'' is the destination of the otherwise unattested Yrp of the Hosts, who depleted Britain's armies by demanding that each of the island's chief fortresses provide him with twice the men he brought; though he began with only two men he left with many thousands.&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; The same versions also give Llychlyn as the destination of the army led by [[Elen (saint)|Elen of the Hosts]] and [[Maxen Wledig]], the Welsh version of the historical Roman usurper [[Magnus Maximus]]. However, [[Rachel Bromwich]] suggests that ''Llychlyn'' in this case might be a corruption of ''Llydaw'', or [[Armorica]], Maxen's usual destination in other sources.&lt;ref name="Bromwich88"/&gt; In ''The Dream of Rhonabwy'', a company from Llychlyn led by [[Mark of Cornwall|March ap Meirchiawn]] (the King Mark of the [[Tristan and Iseult]] legend) appears among Arthur's vividly-depicted host.&lt;ref name="Bromwich435"&gt;Bromwich, p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt; Bromwich suggests this appearance derives ultimately from a recollection of Welsh Triad 14, which depicts March ap Meirchiawn as one of the "Three Seafarers/Fleet Owners of the Island of Britain" – the Scandinavians being famed for their nautical skills.&lt;ref name="Bromwich435"/&gt;

==Literary uses==
Lochlann is the land of the [[Fomorians]] in the Irish ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]''.  In the ''[[Lebor na hUidre]]'' and the ''[[Book of Leinster]]'' the "huge and ugly" Fomorians are pirates who inhabit the [[Outer Hebrides]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1926) pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt;

A Scandinavian Lochlann appears in later Irish tales, generally concerning the King of Lochlann—sometimes called Colgán—or his sons, such as in the tales of [[Lugh]] and the [[Fenian Cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;MacKillop, James, ''Oxford Dictionary of Celtic Mythology'', s.v. "Llychlyn" &amp; "Lochlainn". Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-19-860967-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Lebor Bretnach]]'' – a Gaelic adaption of the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' perhaps compiled at [[Abernethy, Perth and Kinross|Abernethy]]—makes [[Hengist]]'s daughter "the fairest of the women of all Lochlann". Hengist was a legendary [[Anglo-Saxon]] leader of the 5th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;The phrase is an addition to the ''Lebor Bretnach'' and thus cannot be compared to the original ''Historia''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Scarba and The Strait of Coryvreckan - geograph.org.uk - 20844.jpg|thumb|The [[Gulf of Corryvreckan]] between [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]] and [[Scarba]]. According to tradition "Prince Breacan of Lochlann" was shipwrecked there with a fleet of fifty ships.&lt;ref name=HS51&gt;Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HS61&gt;Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WHM71&gt;Murray (1966) pp. 71–2&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The adventures of Prince Breacan of Lochlann are part of the mythology of the naming of the [[Gulf of Corryvreckan]] ({{Lang-gd|Coire Bhreacain}}), a whirlpool between the islands of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]] and [[Scarba]] on the west coast of [[Scotland]]. The story goes that the tidal race was named after this Norse Prince "said to be son to the King of Denmark" who was shipwrecked there with a fleet of fifty ships. Breacan is reputed to be buried in a cave at ''Bagh nam Muc'' (bay of the swine) at the north-western tip of Jura.&lt;ref name=HS51/&gt;&lt;ref name=HS61/&gt; According to Haswell-Smith (2004) [[Adomnan]]'s ''Life of St Columba'' suggests this calamity occurred between Rathlin Island and the [[County Antrim|Antrim]] coast.&lt;ref name=HS51/&gt; [[W.H. Murray]] corroborates the view that the original story may have referred to this latter location, quoting the 10th century ''Glossary'' of Cormac who describes the tale of "Brecan, son of Maine, son of Nial Naoighhiallach".&lt;ref name=WHM71/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Martin|Martin, Martin]] (1703) "[http://www.appins.org/martin.htm A Voyage to St. Kilda] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313003106/http://www.appins.org/martin.htm |date=13 March 2007 }}" in ''A Description of The Western Islands of Scotland'', Appin Regiment/Appin Historical Society. Retrieved 3 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same story is associated with the ''Bealach a' Choin Ghlais'' (pass of the grey dog), a tidal race further north between Scarba and [[Lunga, Firth of Lorn|Lunga]]. The prince's dog managed to swim to land and went in search of his master. Failing to find him on Jura or Scarba he tried to leap across the strait to Lunga, but missed his footing on Eilean a' Bhealaich which sits in the middle of the channel between the two islands. He slipped into the raging current and drowned as well, giving his own name in turn to the strait where he fell.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Mike [http://www.ukseakayakguidebook.co.uk/jura_easter_04/art_jura_easter_2004.htm "Jura &amp; the Corryvreckan ~ tales and legends from an Easter Expedition in 2004"] ukseakayakguidebook.co.uk Retrieved 26 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kareem Dennis''' (born 23 May 1986),&lt;ref name="suuk"/&gt; better known by his [[stage name]] '''Lowkey''', is a [[British Iraqis|British-Iraqi]] [[rapper]] and [[activist]] based in London, England. He first became known through a series of mixtapes he released before he was 18,&lt;ref name="vol3r"/&gt; before taking a hiatus from the music business. He would return in 2008 with wider music coverage, featured on BBC Radio&lt;ref name="1xtra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk//1xtra/semtex/20081031.shtml|title=31 Oct&amp;nbsp;08, Brand New Kanye West, Q-Tip &amp; Lowkey|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcasian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00fc7v4|title=Lowkey is live in the studio to talk about his BBC Electric Proms performance|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appearing at various festivals and concerts including the [[BBC Electric Proms]],&lt;ref name="proms"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/electricproms/2008/artists/lowkey/|title=Electric Proms Artists|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], [[T In The Park]] and [[Oxegen]]&lt;ref name="hhk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hip-hopkings.com/2009/01/lowkey-interview/ |title=Lowkey Interview |last=Hallick |first=Stuart |date=4 January 2009 |publisher=Hip-Hop Kings |accessdate=2009-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090123212731/http://www.hip-hopkings.com/2009/01/lowkey-interview/ |archivedate=23 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the buildup to his first solo album ''[[Dear Listener]]'', as well as collaborating with other British musicians to form the supergroup Mongrel. He released his second solo album ''[[Soundtrack to the Struggle]]'' independently on 16 October 2011.

==Early life==
From the age of twelve he began to rap, initially imitating American rappers but soon began using his own accent.&lt;ref name="suuk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukhh.org/index.php/Interviews/Lowkey.html |title=Lowkey |publisher=Stand Up UK |accessdate=2009-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106144617/http://www.ukhh.org/index.php/Interviews/Lowkey.html |archivedate=6 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began attending the [[open mic]] sessions which took place at the Deal Real record shop on [[Carnaby Street]], [[Central London]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukhh.com/oldreviews/twelve-inch/1661.html/{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first time he went he introduced himself as Lowkey and was told there was already a regular there by that name; the two had a rap battle to decide who would continue to use the alias, Kareem emerged victorious and continued to use the name thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopug.com/lowkey.html/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20100922222914/http://www.hiphopug.com/lowkey.html/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-09-22|title=Hiphopug.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
===2003–09: Mixtapes &amp; ''Dear Listener''===
The first part of his mixtape series ''Key to the Game'', was released independently in 2003.&lt;ref name="hhk"/&gt; Within a year and a half he had released a second and third volume, all of which gained critical acclaim from UK hip hop circles.&lt;ref name="vol3r"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukhh.com/reviews/lp/2036.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219065352/http://www.ukhh.com/reviews/lp/2036.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-12-19 |title=Key to the Game Vol 3 Review |publisher=UK Hip Hop |accessdate=2008-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the first volume largely used music from other artists, the second was mostly original work in conjunction with numerous artists and producers while the third, which had no skits or short songs like a traditional mixtape would, was mostly his own work.&lt;ref name="hhk"/&gt;

While Lowkey the man was busying himself with European tours in support of [[Immortal Technique]], [[Canibus]], and [[Dead Prez]],&lt;ref name="hhk"/&gt; he began to make musical contacts and set about recording his official debut album. Though stalled by [[Lowkey#Other work|other artistic endeavours]], ''[[Dear Listener]]'' was eventually released in January 2009.&lt;ref name="bbcreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/d5mq|title=An album full of poetry.|last=Small|first=Elle J|date=5 February 2009|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factmagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1718&amp;Itemid=32|title=Lowkey 'Dear Listener'|last=Oliver|first=Matt|date=7 January 2009|publisher=Fact Magazine|accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He bookended the year with another release, ''Uncensored'', with highlights from the entire ''Key To The Game'' series and ''Dear Listener''. This was released digitally in December through [[iTunes]].&lt;ref name="uncens"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/uncensored/id340715527|title=Uncensored by Lowkey|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009–12: ''Soundtrack to the Struggle''===
After touring with Immortal Technique the two made a single, "Voices of the Voiceless" which was released in September 2009.&lt;ref name="metro09"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-edition.metro.co.uk/2009/08/13/25.html|title=One to watch: Lowkey|last=Haider|first=Arwa|date=13 August 2009|publisher=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]|accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The second single, "Long Live Palestine" (also known as "Tears to Laughter") was digitally released on 9 March 2009. In December 2009, Lowkey revealed he would release a second part to "Long Live Palestine" featuring international artists including Palestinian rap group [[DAM (band)|DAM]], Anglo-Palestinian soloist [[Shadia Mansour]], [[Narcy (rapper)|Narcy]] from Iraq, Iranian artists [[Hich Kas]] and [[Reveal (rapper)|Reveal]], Syrian-Lebanese performer [[Eslam Jawaad]] and African-American Muslim [[Hasan Salaam]]. "Long Live Palestine" was packaged in an EP with Part 1 and the instrumental.&lt;ref name="llp2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0031CS65U|title=Long Live Palestine Parts 1 &amp; 2: Lowkey|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon]]|accessdate=2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single received statements of support from [[Tony Benn]] and [[Benjamin Zephiniah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palestinecampaign.org/about/patrons/ Palestine Solidarity Campaign: Our Patrons] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104021810/http://www.palestinecampaign.org/about/patrons/ |date=4 January 2015 }} palestinecampaign.org&lt;/ref&gt;

''Soundtrack to the Struggle'' was released on 16 October 2011. The album entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] on 23 October at number 57 – becoming Lowkey's first entry on the national charts. In the [[UK Download Chart]], ''Soundtrack to the Struggle'' peaked higher than its [[UK Albums Chart]] position – at number 14. And in the [[UK R&amp;B Chart]], the album received its highest ''[[The Official Charts Company|OCC]]'' position, number 6. In the [[UK Indie Chart]], the album peaked at number 9.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Chart|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/3/2011-10-29/|publisher=[[The Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=23 October 2011|date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Chart|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/17/2011-10-29/|publisher=[[The Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=23 October 2011|date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Chart|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/13/2011-10-29/|publisher=[[The Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=23 October 2011|date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Chart|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/7/2011-10-29/|publisher=[[The Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=23 October 2011|date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012–16: Musical hiatus===
On 17 April 2012, Lowkey officially put his musical career on hiatus, announcing the news on [[Facebook]]. He said that after months of contemplation, he has decided to "step away from music and concentrate on my studies". With this, he announced that he would deactivate his Facebook page, which had over 180,000 followers.&lt;ref name="sbtvlowkeydeparture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sbtv.co.uk/2012/04/lowkey-announces-his-departure-from-music-news/|title=Lowkey Career Pause|first=Mehreen|date=18 April 2012|publisher=UK Hip Hop|accessdate=2012-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422190012/http://sbtv.co.uk/2012/04/lowkey-announces-his-departure-from-music-news/|archive-date=22 April 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016–present: Return and touring===
On 26 July 2016, various sources shared an image on social media relating to Lowkey's return to the music scene with new single "Ahmed". On 29 July 2016, Lowkey released a video for the single, the subject matter of which revolves around the refugee crisis and Europe's response. In addition, a seven-day tour across the UK in September 2016 was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbtv.co.uk/watch/music-videos/lowkey-ahmed-new-track-uk-tour/|title=Lowkey returns with new track 'Ahmed' and announces a UK Tour - SBTV|first=|last=SBTV|date=29 July 2016|publisher=|access-date=30 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802025727/http://www.sbtv.co.uk/watch/music-videos/lowkey-ahmed-new-track-uk-tour/|archive-date=2 August 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 September, his next single “Children of Diaspora”  was released. The track addresses issues of racism and xenophobia, and mentions victims of police brutality in the UK and US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbtv.co.uk/watch/music-videos/lowkey-children-of-diaspora-mai-khalil/|title=Lowkey returns with video for Mai Khalil-assisted 'Children of Diaspora' - SBTV|first=|last=SBTV|date=5 September 2016|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104022006/http://www.sbtv.co.uk/watch/music-videos/lowkey-children-of-diaspora-mai-khalil/|archivedate=4 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}
 &lt;/ref&gt; 

In August 2018, Lowkey announced via social media that he would be releasing his single 'Ahmed', which features Mai Khalil, on platforms such as Spotify and iTunes on September 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; 2018, stating that this would be his first commercial release since 2011. He has also confirmed that he is in the process of making a second album, entitled ''Soundtrack to the Struggle 2.''

===Collaborations===
Lowkey joined a hip-hop group called Poisonous Poets with which was formed by rapper Reveal and released one self-titled mixtape in 2005.&lt;ref name="ukhhpp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukhh.com/features/interviews/poisonous_poets/index.html |title=Poisonous Poets Interview |first=Mehreen |date=05-04-22 |publisher=UK Hip Hop |accessdate=2009-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223222022/http://www.ukhh.com/features/oldinterviews/poisonous_poets/index.html |archivedate=23 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poisonous Poets (sometimes known as Double P) the group also consisted of Doc Brown whom Lowkey met at Real Deal records, [[Reveal (rapper)|Reveal]], Stylah, Tony D and Therapist.&lt;ref name="ukhhpp"/&gt;

Lowkey's manager passed on the first two parts of ''Key to the Game'' to [[Jon McClure]], frontman of [[Reverend and The Makers]] who is also an outspoken political activist.&lt;ref name="hhc"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McNally|first=James|date=December 2008|title=Low Life|journal=[[Hip Hop Connection]]|issue=229|pages=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wanting to mix popular music with politics, and mix [[indie rock]] with [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], the two set about making a supergroup, [[Mongrel (band)|Mongrel]], composed of other noted musicians. Also in the band is [[Arctic Monkeys]] drummer [[Matt Helders]] and ex-bassist [[Andy Nicholson]] alongside bassist of [[Babyshambles]] [[Drew McConnell]] and a revolving set of other musicians.

Lowkey is a vocal opponent of [[Zionism]] and is a patron of the [[Palestine Solidarity Campaign]]. He characterises Zionism as [[colonialism]] and [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref name="ceasefiremagazine.co.uk"&gt;[http://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/interview-lowkey/ Exclusive Jody Mcintyre interviews Lowkey] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305210353/http://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/interview-lowkey/ |date=5 March 2016 }} Ceasefiremagazine.co.uk, 27 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palestinecampaign.org/Index5b.asp?m_id=1&amp;l1_id=2&amp;l2_id=12 Palestine Solidarity Campaign: Patrons] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302091920/http://www.palestinecampaign.org/Index5b.asp?m_id=1&amp;l1_id=2&amp;l2_id=12 |date=2 March 2009 }} palestinesolidaritycampaign.org, 2 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, he travelled to Palestinian refugee camps around the [[West Bank]] area to perform fundraising shows to help rebuild the [[Gaza Strip]] but was detained by the [[Israel Police]] for nine hours at [[Ben Gurion International Airport]] and interrogated, while having his passport confiscated.&lt;ref name="detained"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/mongrel/43171|title=Mongrel rapper Lowkey detained in Israel airport|date=3 March 2009|publisher=[[NME]]|accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2009, he travelled with [[M-1 (rapper)|M-1]] of [[Dead Prez]] to carry out a humanitarian aid mission and bring medical aid to the [[Palestinian people]] in the [[Gaza Strip]]; this led to a collaboration between the two on ''Soundtrack to the Struggle''.&lt;ref name="conspiracyworldwide.podomatic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conspiracyworldwide.podomatic.com/entry/eg/2010-03-22T15_25_47-07_00|title=PodOmatic - Best Free Podcasts|work=PodOmatic|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was detained for a second time in July 2010, en route to a number of concerts and musical workshops in refugee camps in the West Bank. After detaining him for twelve hours and an online petition was started, he was released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=301454 Israel releases British rapper detained at airport] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317063049/http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=301454 |date=17 March 2014 }} Ma'an News Agency, 21 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowkey has been a prominent member of the [[Stop The War Coalition]] and has spoken against the invasion of Iraq. Furthermore, he has been a sharp critic of United States and British foreign policy, claiming that the two powers are only interested in supporting leaders who are under their influence or are willing to assist them. He also claims American media overlooks those within the country who do not believe in American military supremacy.&lt;ref name="ceasefiremagazine.co.uk"/&gt;

In May 2017, Lowkey endorsed [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 UK general election]]. He said: "We have a choice between policies which foster empathy and policies which foster greed, resentment, estrangement and alienation."&lt;ref name="thecanary1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sykes|first=Ed|url=https://www.thecanary.co/2017/05/19/legendary-uk-rapper-lowkey-explains-why-he-backs-jeremy-corbyn-wholeheartedly-video/|title=Legendary UK rapper Lowkey explains why he backs Jeremy Corbyn ‘wholeheartedly’ [VIDEO]|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Canary (political blog)|The Canary]]''|date=19 May 2017|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thecanary2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Topple|first=Steve|url=https://www.thecanary.co/2017/06/08/rapper-lowkey-tells-canary-whatever-happens-8-june-country-needs-corbyn-video//|title=Rapper Lowkey tells The Canary Corbyn has turned disenchanted people into ‘shapers of the future’ [VIDEO]|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Canary (political blog)|The Canary]]''|date=8 June 2017|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowkey witnessed the [[Grenfell Tower fire]] disaster on 14 June 2017 which resulted in the death of more than 80 people. He criticised the British government, Queen [[Elizabeth II]], corporations and the mainstream media in the wake of the disaster; and opined that the tragic event was a result of the injustice and criminality at the heart of Britain’s current political system.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thecanary.co/2017/06/16/lowkey-explains-grenfell-disaster-must-death-knell-tory-rule-video/&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently made a tribute song titled Ghosts of Grenfell in honor of the victims. He was later hailed in Parliament as "poet laureate" for Grenfell Tower by MP [[Emma Dent Coad]], comparing him and others to [[Ben Jonson]] and [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/poet-stormzy-emma_uk_59666085e4b0d51cda5f6ac9|title=Stormzy Hailed In Parliament As A 'Poet Laureate' Of Grenfell Tower|date=12 July 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics and feuds==

In January 2011, Marcus Dysch writing for the ''[[Jewish Chronicle]]'' about the involvement of Lowkey in the Palestine Solidarity Campaign claimed "One expert studying anti-Israel activity described the increasing influence of performers such as Lowkey as a "potential nightmare," and compared the impact of his backing for the campaign to the effect of artists such as [[Annie Lennox]] and [[Elvis Costello]] "attacking the Jewish state."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/node/44347 Palestine Solidarity Campaign hits the youth trail] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304195601/http://www.thejc.com/node/44347 |date=4 March 2016 }} thejc.com, 27 Jan 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox News]] host [[Glenn Beck]] mocked Lowkey on his radio show, poking fun at the lyrics of his song "Terrorist?", and recorded himself dancing to the song and showing gang signs in an effort to ridicule the content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theblaze.com/stories/why-is-glenn-beck-dancing-throwing-up-gang-signs-and-listening-to-anti-american-rap/ Why is Glenn Beck dancing, throwing gang signs and listening to anti American rap] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113082405/http://www.theblaze.com/stories/why-is-glenn-beck-dancing-throwing-up-gang-signs-and-listening-to-anti-american-rap/ |date=13 November 2012 }} theblaze.com, 10 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, Lowkey and [[Chipmunk (rapper)|Chipmunk]], who was signed to [[Sony]] at the time, argued on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelalareport.com/jhome/2010/6/16/lowkey-vs-chipmunk-the-saga-continues.html Lowkey VS Chipmunk – The Sage Continues] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308031659/http://www.thelalareport.com/jhome/2010/6/16/lowkey-vs-chipmunk-the-saga-continues.html |date=8 March 2016 }} The LALA Report Wednesday, 16 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The two tied in tenth place on [[MTV Base]]'s poll of ''Best Of The Best: UK MCs 2010'' with [[Tinie Tempah]] in the top position.

Lowkey turned down an opportunity to appear on [[Tim Westwood]] TV in protest, after Westwood chose to broadcast his show from the British military base [[Camp Bastion]] in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/lowkey-no-to-westwood-tv/ Lowkey: Why I had to say no to Westwood TV] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023701/https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/lowkey-no-to-westwood-tv/ |date=4 March 2016 }} ceasefiremagazine.co.uk, Wednesday 25th January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''‘Made in Russia’''' national [[brand]] is a Russian communication project aimed at promoting and raising awareness of Russia’s [[export|exports]], [[business]], and culture in both domestic and foreign [[market (economics)|markets]]. 
The project was created by a team of professional translators, designers, marketers, and foreign trade specialists with the goal of improving communication - in every sense of the word - between Russian companies and international audiences.

Amongst its other activities, ‘Made in Russia’ is working to promote the country’s non-commodity goods, attracting necessary partners and target audiences through media platforms, a multi-lingual online portal, catalogues with information about domestic export companies, and a unified corporate style: visual identification systems combining all Russian exports.  
The concept and logo of ‘Made in Russia’ have been included in the second edition of an international textbook on branding called Nation Branding. Keith Dinnie, the author of the book, is a PhD candidate, an expert on branding, and a leading business school lecturer at Middlesex University in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brandhorizons.com/book/nation-branding-concepts-issues-practice-2nd-edition Nation Branding: Concepts, Issues, Practice (2nd Edition) ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Logo and corporate style''' 
[[File:MadeInRussiaLogoEn.jpg|thumb|The "Made In Russia" logo]]

"Commercial use of Made in Russia"
[[File:"Made in Russia" printed on a "Raketa" shoping bag (2).jpg|thumb|"Made in Russia" printed on a shopping bag]]

The logo for ‘Made in Russia’ is a combination of a bar code and birch bark texture. References to business, goods production and sales, and the rich culture and history of Russian entrepreneurship are all included in the logo.

The ‘Made in Russia’ logo has been legally registered in all Nice 45 classes ([[International (Nice) Classification of Goods and Services|International Classification of Goods and Services]]).

The logo and corporate style of ‘Made in Russia’ have already become a visual support element used by Russian exporters in business missions around the world organized by the Russian Ministry for Economic Development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mid.ru/maps/cu/-/asset_publisher/ZCoR8WfDPJng/content/id/1920362/pop_up?_101_INSTANCE_ZCoR8WfDPJng_viewMode=print&amp;_101_INSTANCE_ZCoR8WfDPJng_qrIndex=0 http://www.mid.ru/maps/cu/-/asset_publisher/ZCoR8WfDPJng/content/id/1920362/pop_up?_101_INSTANCE_ZCoR8WfDPJng_viewMode=print&amp;_101_INSTANCE_ZCoR8WfDPJng_qrIndex=0]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rights to use the national brand’s logo'''

Companies that are registered, pay taxes, and create jobs in Russia are eligible to use the logo. All companies are selected and approved by the project’s expert advisory board. The logo is issued free of charge for a period of one year, with the possibility of extension upon entrance into the ‘Made in Russia’ register.

Foreign companies may also qualify for the logo if they have joint ventures in Russia or have localized their business inside the country.

'''Official ‘Made in Russia’ portal'''

There is currently a multi-lingual portal  www.madeinrussia.ru and media platform for promoting Russian exporters, and catalogues about Russian export companies have also been created.

'''International presentation of the ‘Made in Russia’ national brand'''

The ‘Made in Russia’ national brand was presented to the international business community at the [[Expo 2015|Milan EXPO 2015]] exhibition. Its presentation comprised part of Made in Russia Day at the Russian pavilion with the participation of Igor Shuvalov, the first deputy prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.wn.com/view/2015/06/06/The_First_VicePremier_Igor_Shuvalov_promotes_the_Made_in_Rus/ http://article.wn.com/view/2015/06/06/The_First_VicePremier_Igor_Shuvalov_promotes_the_Made_in_Rus/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the project participated as an informational and visual partner in a number of events for Russian exporters both in Russia and abroad. As a result, a number of agreements were signed and contacts made, as well as an assessment of the prospects for exporting Russian products, which included a study of reactions to the new brand.

'''International experience'''
[[File:InternEng.jpg|thumb|The international branding experience]]

National brands are a common trend in many countries’ foreign policies. Similar promotion programs have been implemented in other nations.  The national brands ‘Made in…’ are also available in Germany, Canada, the USA, China, Italy, Belarus, India and other countries.

'''Expert opinion'''

“The ‘Made in Russia’ national brand offers a single system for image promotion to domestic exporters that includes a variety of tools to help Russian producers effectively present their products in the process of entering foreign markets.” (Alexey Tyupano, CEO of EXIAR) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazeta.ru/eksport/2015/12/08_a_7942769.shtml http://www.gazeta.ru/eksport/2015/12/08_a_7942769.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

“The idea and conception of the ‘Made in Russia’ national brand seemed very interesting to me, and worthy to talk about with readers.” (author of the Nation Brand textbook on branding, Keith Dinnie – a PhD candidate, branding expert, leading business school lecturer at Middlesex University in London) &lt;ref&gt;[http://madeinrussia.ru/ru/news/98 http://madeinrussia.ru/ru/news/98]&lt;/ref&gt;

“The idea of patriotism in our time often turns into clowning... from this point of view, the website www.madeinrussia.ru is interesting. It gives a reasonable attempt, devoid of ridiculous patriotic jingoism, to summarize all brands and people whom our country can be proud of in every field - from Faberge, the jeweler to the tsars, to Igor Butman, the contemporary jazz musician.” (Leonid Kaganov, author and scriptwriter) &lt;ref&gt;[http://lleo.me/dnevnik/2013/10/11_madeinrussia.html http://lleo.me/dnevnik/2013/10/11_madeinrussia.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

“The project aims to support and promote the best domestic achievements in various arenas: science, production, education, business, society, culture, and sports. It brings together companies that are developing their business in Russia and are creating new technologies - be it architecture, marketing, or sales - and through its work, promotes these achievements as a brand of Russian business.” (Irina Dobrokhotova, chairman of the board of directors at Best-Novostroy) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazeta.ru/eksport/2015/06/25_a_6853881.shtml http://www.gazeta.ru/eksport/2015/06/25_a_6853881.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

“The ‘Made in Russia’ project is a powerful label integrator whose mission is to gather Russian companies and become a forceful consolidation tool for them. International experience suggests that such initiatives are both strong and promising.” (Alexey Andreyev, managing partner of Depot WPF branding agency) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.depotwpf.ru/publications/414/ http://www.depotwpf.ru/publications/414/]&lt;/ref&gt;

“The open, cooperative nature of this initiative has been highlighted at the communicative level. It was important for the creator of this idea to show that it’s possible to receive government assistance quickly and easily.” (Elena Yufereva, CEO of Brandson Branding Agency) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazeta.ru/eksport/2015/06/25_a_6853881.shtml http://www.gazeta.ru/eksport/2015/06/25_a_6853881.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''modern Indian art''' movement in [[Indian painting]] is considered to have begun in [[Calcutta]] in the late nineteenth century.The old traditions of painting had more or less died out in Bengal and new schools of art were started by the British.&lt;ref name="Bhattacharya1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhattacharya|first=Sunil Kumar|title=Trends in modern Indian art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SIs5qkjljpQC|accessdate=14 December 2011|date=1 January 1994|publisher=M.D. Publications Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=978-81-85880-21-1|pages=7–11|chapter=2. Revivalism and the Impact of the West}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, protagonists of Indian art such as [[Raja Ravi Varma]] drew on Western traditions and techniques including oil paint and easel painting. A reaction to the Western influence led to a revival in primitivism, called as the [[Bengal school of art]], which drew from the rich cultural heritage of India. It was succeeded by the [[Santiniketan]] school, led by [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s harking back to idyllic rural folk and rural life. Despite its country-wide influence in the early years, the importance of the School declined by the 'forties' and now it is as good as dead. 

==British art schools==
Oil and easel painting In India began in the starting of eighteenth century which saw many European artists, such as [[Johann Zoffany|Zoffany]], [[Tilly Kettle|Kettle]], [[William Hodges|Hodges]], [[Thomas Daniell|Thomas]] and [[William Daniell]], [[Joshua Reynolds]], [[Emily Eden]] and [[George Chinnery]] coming out to India in search of fame and fortune.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kapur|first=Geeta|editor=Turner, Caroline|title=Art and social change: contemporary art in Asia and the Pacific|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lYmfAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=12 December 2011|year=2005|publisher=Pandanus Books, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, the Australian National University|isbn=978-1-74076-046-1|pages=146–163|chapter=A Stake in Modernity – A Brief History of Modern Indian Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courts of the [[princely state]]s of India were an important draw for European artists due to their patronage of the visual and performing arts and also their need for European style of portraits

The merchants of the [[East India Company]] also provided a large market for native art. A distinct genre developed of watercolour painting on paper and mica in the later half of the 18th century depicting scenes of everyday life, regalia of princely courts, and native festivities and rituals. Referred to as the "[[Company style]]" or "Patna style", it flourished at first in Murshidabad and spread to other cities of British suzerainty. The style is considered by authorities to be "of hybrid style and undistinguished quality".&lt;ref name="Educational2010"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Kuiper, Kathleen|title=The Culture of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LiqloV4JnNUC&amp;pg=PA230|accessdate=10 February 2012|date=1 July 2010|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group &amp; Britannica Educational Publishing|isbn=978-1-61530-203-1|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-1857, [[John Griffiths (artist)|John Griffiths]] and [[John Lockwood Kipling]] (father of [[Rudyard Kipling]]) came out to India together; Griffith going on to head the [[Sir J. J. School of Art]] and being considered as one of the finest Victorian painters to come to India and Kipling went on to head both the J. J. School of Art and the [[Mayo School of Arts]] established in [[Lahore]] in 1878.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TOI05102007"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kipling house to become museum |author= |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-10-05/mumbai/27989345_1_kipling-house-bungalow-jsw-foundation |newspaper=Times of India |date=October 5, 2007 |accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Raja Ravi Varma==
[[Raja Ravi Varma]]  (1848–1906) was a remarkable self-taught [[India]]n [[Painting|painter]] from the [[princely state]] of [[Travancore]]. His exposure in the west came when he won the first prize in the [[Vienna]] Art Exhibition in 1873. Varma's paintings were also sent to the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] held in Chicago in 1893 and his work was awarded two gold medals.&lt;ref&gt;Kilimanoor Chandran, ''Ravi Varmayum Chitrakalayum''(in Malayalam), Department of Culture, Kerala, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered the first of the modernists, and, along with [[Amrita Sher-gil]] (1913–1941), the main exponents of Western techniques to develop a new aesthetic in the subjective interpretation of Indian culture with "the promise of materiality in the medium of oils and the reality-paradigm of the mirror/window format of easel painting".&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; Some other prominent Indian painters born in the 19th century are [[M. V. Dhurandhar|Mahadev Vishwanath Dhurandhar]] (1867–1944), [[A X Trindade]] (1870–1935),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Nalini Bhagwat |url=http://www.indiaart.com/Articles-and-Features/Articles-on-A-X-Trindade-by-Nalini-Bhagwat/Articles-on-A-X-Trindade-by-Nalini-Bhagwat.asp |title=Old Master A.

The work of Varma was considered to be among the best examples of the fusion of Indian traditions with the techniques of European [[academic art]], in the colonial-nationalistic framework of the 19th century. He is most remembered for his paintings of beautiful [[sari]]-clad [[women]], who were portrayed as shapely and graceful. Varma became the best-known allegorist of Indian subjects in his depiction of scenes from the [[Epic poetry|epics]] of the [[Mahabharata]] and [[Ramayana]].

Raja Ravi Varma considered his work as "establishing a new civilisational identity within the terms of 19th Century India".&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt;{{rp|147}} He aimed to form an Indian canton of art in the manner of those of the classic Greek and Roman civilisations.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; Varma's art came to play an important role in the development of the Indian national consciousness. Varma purchased a printing press which churned out oleograph copies of his paintings which graced the middle-class homes of India, many decades after he died.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; Considered a genius in his heydey, within a few years of his passing, Varma's paintings came under severe strictures for mimicking Western art.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Raja Ravi Varma died in 1906 at the age of 58. He is considered among the greatest painters in [[Indian art|the history of Indian art]].

==The Bengal School==
{{main|Bengal School of Art}}
During the colonial era, Western influences had started to make an impact on Indian art. Some artists developed a style that used Western ideas of composition, perspective and realism to illustrate Indian themes, [[Raja Ravi Varma]] being prominent among them.&lt;ref name="Mitter1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitter|first=Partha|title=Art and nationalism in colonial India, 1850–1922: occidental orientations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mRTtkri8E0C&amp;pg=PA179|accessdate=12 December 2011|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-44354-8|pages=179–215|chapter=5 – The Artist as Charismatic Individual – Raja Ravi Varma}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bengal school arose as an [[avant garde]] and nationalist movement reacting against the [[academic art]] styles previously promoted in India, both by Indian artists such as Varma and in British art schools.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt;

Following the widespread influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the [[Western world|West]], the British art teacher [[Ernest Binfield Havel]] attempted to reform the teaching methods at the [[Calcutta School of Art]] by encouraging students to imitate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniatures.&lt;ref name="Cotter2008"/&gt;
This caused immense controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Havel was supported by the artist [[Abanindranath Tagore]], a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]].&lt;ref name="Cotter2008"/&gt;

Abanindranath painted a number of works influenced by Mughal art, a style that he and Havel believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the "materialism" of the West. His best-known painting, ''Bharat Mata'' (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. The other prominent figures of the [[Bengal school of art]] were [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], Abanindranath's elder brother, [[Jamini Roy]], [[Mukul Dey]], [[Manishi Dey]] and [[Ram Kinker Baij]], who is more famous as the pioneer of Modern Indian Sculpture. Another important figure of this era was [[Chittaprosad Bhattacharya]], who rejected the classicism of the Bengal School and its spiritual preoccupations.&lt;ref name=multi2&gt;''Manifestations II'', Rabina Karode, Delhi Art Gallery 2004, {{ISBN|81-902104-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''Hungry Bengal : a tour through Midnapur District'' included many sketches of the Bengal Famine drawn from life, as well as documentation of the persons depicted. The book was immediately banned by the British and 5000 copies were seized and destroyed. Only one copy was hidden by Chittaprosad's family and is now in the possession of the Delhi Art Gallery.

During the opening years of the 20th century, Abanindranath developed links with Japanese cultural figures such as the art historian [[Okakura Kakuzō]] and the painter [[Yokoyama Taikan]] as part of a globalised [[Modernism|Modernist]] initiative with [[pan-Asianism|pan-Asian]] tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Arrowsmith, Rupert Richard.

Those associated with this Indo-Far Eastern model included [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]], Vinayak Shivaram Masoji, [[B.C. Sanyal]], [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha]], and subsequently their students [[A. Ramachandran]], Tan Yuan Chameli, and a few others. The Bengal school's influence on Indian art scene gradually started alleviating with the spread of [[modernist]] ideas post-independence.

==Santiniketan==
The mantle of the Bengal School was taken up when Rabindranath Tagore established the visionary university of [[Santiniketan]], a university focussed on the preservation and upliftment of Indian culture, values and heritage.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; It included an art school "[[Kala Bhavan]]" founded in 1920–21. Though Rabindranath himself came late to painting in his long, productive life, his ideas greatly influenced Indian modernism.&lt;ref name="Mitter2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitter|first=Partha|title=The triumph of modernism: India's artists and the avant-garde, 1922–1947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=krdWkzVLSbkC|accessdate=13 December 2011|year=2007|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-86189-318-5|pages=65–72|chapter=2. The Indian Discourse of Primitivism. II – Rabindranath's Vision of Art and the Community}}&lt;/ref&gt; In private, Tagore made small drawings, coloured with inks, for which he drew inspiration for his primitivism from his unconscious.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitter2007"/&gt; In public life, Rabindranath's primitivism can be directly attributed to an anti-colonial resistance, akin to that of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref name="Mitter2007"/&gt;

One of the early students of Abanindranath Tagore was [[Nandalal Bose]], who subsequently became a teacher and later the Director for art.&lt;ref name="Cotter2008"/&gt; Nandalal led the school to a position of pre-eminence in the nationalistic ideology now emerging in Indian culture. The Shantiniketan school of thought emphasised that "an aesthetic was also an ethos, that art’s role was more than life-enhancing, it was world-shaping".&lt;ref name="Cotter2008"/&gt; It established an Indian version of naturalism distinct from the oriental and western schools, one example being the eschewing of oil and easel painting for work on paper drawn/coloured using watercolours, wash, tempera and ink.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; Rabindranath Tagore's dream of veneration of old values, typified by motifs such as rural folk, especially [[Santhal people|Santhal]] tribals, came to fruition in the art-related schools of [[Viswa-Bharati University]] at Santiniketan.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; Some of the prominent artists of Santiniketan school are [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]], Ramkinkar Baij, Shanko Chowdhury,  Dinkar Kowshik, [[K. G. Subramanyan]], [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha]], Krishna Reddy, A Ramachandran, Shobha Brhma, Ramananda Bandhapadhyay, Dharma Narayan Dasgupta, Sushen Ghose,  Janak Jhankar Narzary .

===Contextual Modernism===
{{main|Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism}}
[[File:Professor R. Siva Kumar.jpg|thumb|art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]]]]
The idea of [[Contextual Modernism]] emerged in 1997 from [[R. Siva Kumar]]'s [[Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism]] as a [[postcolonial]] critical tool in the understanding of an alternative [[modernism]] in the visual arts of the erstwhile colonies like India, specifically that of the Santiniketan artists.

Several terms including [[Paul Gilroy]]’s ''counter culture of modernity'' and [[Tani Barlow]]'s ''Colonial modernity'' have been used to describe the kind of alternative modernity that emerged in non-European contexts. Professor Gall argues that ‘Contextual Modernism’ is a more suited term because "the colonial in ''colonial modernity'' does not accommodate the refusal of many in colonized situations to internalize inferiority. Santiniketan’s artist teachers’ refusal of subordination incorporated a counter vision of modernity, which sought to correct the racial and cultural essentialism that drove and characterized imperial Western modernity and modernism. Those European modernities, projected through a triumphant British colonial power, provoked nationalist responses, equally problematic when they incorporated similar essentialisms."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huichawaii.org/assets/gall,-david---overcoming-polarized-modernities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[R. Siva Kumar]] "The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism."&lt;ref name="humanitiesunderground.org"&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt; He had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 80s. The practice of subsuming [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] under the [[Bengal School of Art]] was, according to Siva Kumar, misleading. ''This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice''.&lt;ref name="humanitiesunderground.org"/&gt;

''Contextual Modernism'' in the recent past has found its usage in other related fields of studies, specially in [[Architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:444711&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-independence==
By the time of Independence in 1947, several schools of art in India provided access to modern techniques and ideas. Galleries were established to showcase these artists. Modern Indian art typically shows the influence of Western styles, but is often inspired by Indian themes and images. Major artists are beginning to gain international recognition, initially among the Indian diaspora, but also among non-Indian audiences.

The [[Progressive Artists' Group]], established shortly after India became independent in 1947, was intended to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. Its founder was [[Francis Newton Souza]] and [[S. H. Raza]], [[M. F. Husain]] and [[Manishi Dey]] were early members. It was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all of the major artists of India in the 1950s were associated with the group. Prominent among them were [[Akbar Padamsee]], [[Sadanand Bakre]], [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], [[Tyeb Mehta]], [[K. H. Ara]], [[H. A. Gade]] and Bal Chabda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngmaindia.gov.in/sh-pag.asp |title=Showcase – Artists Collectives |publisher=National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi |date=2012-11-09 |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, [[Vasudeo S. Gaitonde|V. S. Gaitonde]], [[Krishen Khanna]] and [[Mohan Samant]] joined the Group. The group disbanded in 1956.

Women artists like [[B. Prabha]], [[Shanu Lahiri]], [[Arpita Singh]], [[Anjolie Ela Menon]] and [[Lalita Lajmi]] have made immense contributions to Modern Indian Art and Painting. Art historians like Prof. Rai [[Anand Krishna]] have also referred to those works of modern artistes that reflect Indian ethos. Some of the acclaimed contemporary Indian artists include [[Nagasamy Ramachandran]], [[Jitish Kallat]], [[Atul Dodiya]] and [[Geeta Vadhera]]  who has had acclaim in translating complex, Indian spiritual themes onto canvas like Sufi thought, the Upanishads and the Bhagwad Geeta.

Indian Art got a boost with the economic liberalization of the country since early 1990s. Artists from various fields now started bringing in varied styles of work. Post liberalization Indian art works not only within the confines of academic traditions but also outside it. Artists have introduced new concepts which have hitherto not been seen in Indian art. [[Devajyoti Ray]] has introduced a new genre of art called [[Pseudorealism]]. Pseudorealist Art is an original art style that has been developed entirely on the Indian soil. Pseudorealism takes into account the Indian concept of abstraction and uses it to transform regular scenes of Indian life into fantastic images.

In post-liberalization India, many artists have established themselves in the international art market like the [[Abstract art|abstract painter]] [[Natvar Bhavsar]], abstract Art painter [[Nabakishore Chanda]], and sculptor [[Anish Kapoor]] whose mammoth [[postminimalist]] artworks have acquired attention for their sheer size. Many art houses and galleries have also opened in USA and Europe to showcase Indian artworks.

'''Mycenaean pottery''' was produced from c. 1600 BC to c. 1000 BC by [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greek]] [[pottery|potters]]. It is divided by archaeologists into a series of stillages on the slopes of hills to, eventually, the dominating culture of [[Ancient Greece]].

Mycenaeans rose in prominence around 1600&amp;nbsp;BC and stayed in control of [[Greece]] until about 1100&amp;nbsp;BC. Evidence shows that they spoke an early form of [[Greek language|Greek]]. They took control of [[Crete]] c. 1450&amp;nbsp;BC.

An abundance of Mycenaean pottery is found in [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]], suggesting that they were in contact and traded with the Mycenaeans.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Arthur. ''Greek Pottery''. London: Faber, 1971. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late Helladic I-IIA (c. 1675/1650 – 1490/1470 BC)==

There is some question as to how much of the pottery of this age relies on [[Minoan pottery]] for both their shapes and the patterns. For at least the first half of the seventeenth century BC there is only a small portion of all pottery produced that is in the Minoan style.

Late Helladic I-IIA pottery can be distinguished by the use of a more lustrous paint than the predecessors. While this is more common during this age, there was a considerable amount of pottery produced in the Middle [[Helladic period]] style, using matte paints and middle Helladic shapes.

Where the first recognizably Mycenaean pottery emerged is still under debate. Some believe that this development took place in the northeast [[Peloponnese]] (probably in the vicinity of [[Mycenae]]). There is also evidence that suggests that the style appeared in the southern Peloponnese (probably [[Lanconia]]) as a result of the Minoan potters taking up residence at coastal sites along the [[Greek Mainland]].&lt;ref name="projectsx.dartmouth.edu"&gt;http://projectsx.dartmouth.edu/classics/history/bronze_age/lessons/les/24.html#10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Helladic I (c. 1675/1650 – 1600/1550 BC)===

The pottery during this period varies greatly in style from area to area. Due to the influence of [[Minoan Crete]], the further south the site, the more the pottery is influenced by Minoan styles.

The easiest way to distinguish the pottery of this period from that of the late [[Middle Helladic]] is the use of a fine ware that is painted in a '''dark-on-light''' style with lustrous paints. This period also marks the appearance of a fine ware that is coated all over with paint varying from red and black in color. This ware is '''monochrome painted''' and is directly descended from grey and black [[Minyan ware]] (which disappear during LH I). A form of the '''yellow Minyan''' style also appears in this period, merging into Mycenaean unpainted wares.

Additionally, Mycenaean art is different from that of the Minoans in that the different elements of a work are distinguished from each other much more clearly, whereas Minoan art is generally more fluid. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/745332893|title=Greek art and archaeology : a new history, c. 2500-c. 150 BCE|last=T.,|first=Neer, Richard|isbn=9780500288771|location=New York|oclc=745332893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also some carry-over of matte-painted wares from the Middle Helladic period into LH I. The majority of large closed vessels that bear any painted decorations are matte. They are generally decorated in two styles of matte paints known as ''Aeginetan Dichrome'' and ''Mainland Polychrome''.

Some of the preferred shapes during this period were the '''vapheio cup''', '''semi globular cup''', '''alabastron''', and '''piriform jar'''.

===Late Helladic IIA (c. 1600/1550 – 1490/1470 BC)===

During this phase there is a drastic increase in the amount of fine pottery that is decorated with lustrous paints. An increase in uniformity in the [[Peloponnese]] (both in painting and shape) can be also seen at this time. However, [[Central Greece]] is still defined by Helladic pottery, showing little Minoan influence at all, which supports the theory that Minoan influence on ceramics traveled gradually from south to north.

By this period, matte-painted pottery is much less common and the Grey Minyan style has completely disappeared. In addition to the popular shapes of LH I [[goblets]], '''jugs''', and '''jars''' have increased in popularity.&lt;ref name="projectsx.dartmouth.edu"/&gt;

===Late Helladic IIB-IIIA1 (c. 1490/1470 – 1390/1370 BC)===
[[File:Pottery from chamber tomb 10 of Dendra 1.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Archaeological Museum of Nafplion]]: [[wikt:pyriform|pyriform]] jar from chamber tomb 10 of the [[Dendra]] cemetery (1500-1450 BC)]]
During this phase, Minoan civilization slowly decreased in importance and eventually the Mycenaeans rose in importance, possibly even temporarily being in control of the Cretan palace of [[Knossos]]. The mainland pottery began to break away from Minoan styles and Greek potters started creating more abstract pottery as opposed to the previously naturalistic Minoan forms. This abstract style eventually spread to Crete as well.

====Late Helladic IIB (c. 1490/1470 – 1435/1405 BC)====
During this period the most popular style was the Ephyraean style; most commonly represented on goblets and jugs. This style is thought to be a spin-off of the '''Alternating style''' of LM IB. This style has a restricted shape range, which suggests that potters may have used it mostly for making matching sets of jugs, goblets and dippers.

It is during LH IIB that the dependence on Minoan ceramics is completely erased. In fact, looking at the pottery found on Crete during this phase suggests that artistic influence is now flowing in the opposite direction; the Minoans are now using Mycenaean pottery as a reference.

Ivy, lilies, and nautili are all popular patterns during this phase and by now there is little to no matte painting.

====Late Helladic IIIA1 (c. 1435/1405 – 1390/1370 BC)====
During LH IIIA1, there are many stylistic changes. Most notably, the Mycenaean goblet begins to lengthen its stem and have a more shallow bowl. This stylistic change marks the beginning of the transformation from goblet to ''kylix''. The vapheio cup also changes into an early sort of mug and becomes much rarer. Also during this period, the stirrup jar becomes a popular style and naturalistic motifs become less popular.

===Late Helladic IIIA2-B (c. 1390/1370 – 1190 BC)===
Not long after the beginning of this stage there is evidence of major destruction at the palace at Knossos on Crete. The importance of Crete and Minoan power decreases and Mycenaean culture rises in dominance in the southern [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. It was during this period that the [[Levant]], [[Egypt]] and [[Cyprus]] came into close and continuous contact with the Greek world. Masses of Mycenaean pottery found in excavated sites in the eastern Mediterranean show that not only were these ancient civilizations in contact with each other, but also had some form of established trade.

The '''Koine style''' (from Greek ''koinos'' = "common") is the style of pottery popular in the first three quarters of this era. This form of pottery is thus named for its intense technical and stylistic uniformity, over a large area of the eastern and central Mediterranean. During LH IIIA it is virtually impossible to tell where in Mycenaean Greece a specific vase was made. Pottery found on the islands north of [[Sicily]] is almost identical to that found in Cyprus and the [[Levant]].        
It is only during the LH IIIB period that stylistic uniformity decreased; around the same time that the amount of trade between the [[Peloponnese]] and Cyprus dramatically decreased.

====Late Helladic IIIA2 (c. 1390/1370 – 1320/1300 BC)====
It is in this period that the [[Kylix (drinking cup)|''kylix'']] truly becomes the dominant shape of pottery found in settlement deposits. The [[stirrup jar]], piriform jar, and [[alabastron]] are the shapes most frequently found in tombs from this era.
Also during LH IIIA2 two new motifs appear: the whorl shell and LH III flower. These are both stylized rather than naturalistic, further separating Mycenaean pottery from Minoan influence.

Excavations at [[Tell el-Amarna]] in Egypt have found large deposits of Aegean pottery. These findings provide excellent insight to the shape range (especially closed forms) of Mycenaean pottery. By this time, monochrome painted wares were almost exclusively large kylikes and stemmed bowls while fine unpainted wares are found in a vast range of shapes.

====Late Helladic IIIB (c. 1320/1300 – 1190 BC)====
The presence of the deep bowl as well as the conical kylix in this age is what allows one to differentiate from LH IIIA. During LH IIIB paneled patterns also appear. Not long into this phase the deep bowl becomes the most popular decorated shape, although for unpainted wares the kylix is still the most produced.

One can further distinguish the pottery from this period into two sub-phases:
* '''LH IIIB1:''' this phase is characterized by an equal presence of both painted deep bowls and kylikes. The kylikes at this time are mostly ''Zigouries''.
* '''LH IIIB2:''' during this phase there is an absence of decorates kylikes and deep bowl styles further develop into the ''Rosette'' form.

It is unknown how long each sub-phase lasted, but by the end of LH IIIB2 the palaces of Mycenae and [[Tiryns]] and the citadel at [[Midea, Greece|Midea]] had all been destroyed. The palace of [[Pylos]] was also destroyed at some point during this phase, but it is impossible to tell when in relation to the others the destruction took place.

===Late Helladic IIIC (c. 1190 – 1050/1025 BC)===
During this period, the differences in ceramics from different regions become increasingly more noticeable, suggesting further degradation of trade at this time. Other than a brief 'renaissance' period that took place mid-twelfth century that brought some developments, the pottery begins to deteriorate. This decline continues until the end of LH IIIC, where there is no place to go but up in terms of technical and artistic pottery.

The shapes and decorations of the ceramics discovered during this final period show that the production of pottery was reduced to little more than a household industry, suggesting that this was a time of poverty in Greece.

It is possible to divide this phase into several different sub-phases.

====Early phase====
At this time, the '''medium band''' form of deep bowl appears and most painted shapes in this phase have linear decoration. Occasionally new shapes (like the '''carinated cup''') and new decorations appear, helping to distinguish wares from this period from those of earlier phases.

Around the same time as the destruction of the great palaces and citadels is recovered an odd class of handmade pottery lacking any ancestry in the Mycenaean world. Similar pottery is also found in other areas both to the East (e.g. [[Troy]], Cyprus and [[Lebanon]]) and to the West ([[Sardinia]] and [[Southern Italy]]). Most of the scholars in recent times agree that such a development is probably to be interpreted as the result of long-range connections with the Central Mediterranean area (and in particular with southern Italy),&lt;ref&gt;Kilian, K. 2007. Tiryns VII. Die handgemachte geglättete Keramik mykenischer Zeitstellung. Reichert, Wiesbaden.&lt;/ref&gt; and some have connected this with the appearance in the Eastern Mediterranean of the so-called [[Sea Peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boileau | first1 = M.-C. | last2 = Badre | first2 = L. | last3 = Capet | first3 = E. | last4 = Jung | first4 = R. | last5 = Mommsen | first5 = H. | year = 2010 | title = Foreign ceramic tradition, local clays: the Handmade Burnished Ware of Tell Kazel (Syria) | url = | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | volume = 37 | issue = 7| pages = 1678–1689 | doi=10.1016/j.jas.2010.01.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Developed phase====
In this sub-phase there is increased development in pattern painted pottery. Scenes of warriors (both foot soldiers and on chariots) become more popular. The majority of the developments however are representational motifs in a variety of regional styles:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Style !! Region !! Example
|-
| Closed style || [[Argolid]] ||
|-
| Octopus style || eastern [[Attica]], [[Cyclades]], [[Dodecanese]] ||
|-
| Pictorial or Fantastic style || [[Lefkandi]] ||
|-
| Fringed style || [[Crete]] ||
|}

====Late phase====
There is very little pottery found during this phase, thus not providing much information. It is clear, however, that the bountiful decorations of the developed phase are no longer around. When patterns did occur in this phase, they were very simple; most of the pottery was decorated with a simple band or a solid coat of paint.

==Technology==
The earliest form of the [[potter's wheel]] was developed in the Near East around 3500 BC. This was then adopted by the people of [[Mesopotamia]] who later altered the performance of the wheel to make it faster. Around 2000 years later, during the Late [[Helladic period]], Mycenaeans adopted the wheel.

The idea behind the pottery wheel was to increase the production of pottery. The wheels consisted of a circular platform, either made of baked clay, wood or terracotta and were turned by hand; the artist usually had an assistant that turned the wheel while he molded the clay.

Clay is dug from the ground, checked for impurities and placed on the wheel to be molded. Once the potter gets the shape he desires, the potter stops the wheel, allowing the access water to run of. The artist then spins it again to ensure the water is off then it is placed in a [[kiln]]. The kiln was usually a pit dug in the ground and heated by fire; these were estimated to reach a temperature of 950 degree Celsius (1,742 degree Fahrenheit). Later kilns were built above ground to be easier to maintain and ventilate. During the firing of the pottery, artists went through a three-phase firing in order to achieve the right colour (further reading).

Many [[historians]] question how Mycenaean potter's developed the technique of glossing their pottery. Some speculate that there is a "elite or a similar clay mineral in a weak solution"&lt;ref name="A History of Pottery"&gt;[http://www.artistictile.net/pages/Info/Info_pottery.html]&lt;/ref&gt; of water. This mixture is then applied to the pottery and placed in the [[kiln]] to set the surface. [[Art Historians]] suggest that the "black areas on Greek pots are neither pigment nor glaze but a slip of finely sifted clay that originally was of the same reddish clay used."&lt;ref name="The Mycenaean Pottery of Attica"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/30096719.pdf?acceptTC=true&amp;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the appearance of the pottery, many [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] fragments of pottery that have been uncovered, has indicated that there is colour to the pottery. Much of this colouring comes from the clay itself; pigments are absorbed from the soil. Vourvatsi pots start off with a pink clay "due merely to long burial in the deep red soil of the [[Mesmogia]]". "The colours of the clay vary from white and reds to yellows and browns. The result of the pottery is due to the effects of the [[kiln]]; this ties in the three-phases of firing."&lt;ref name="Greek Pottery"&gt;[Kleiner, Fred S. Gardner's Art Through the Ages. 13 ed. Boston, 2010. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Phase One''': Oxidizing. Oxygen is added to the kiln, thus creates the slip and pot to turn red
*'''Phase Two''': Reducing. The shutter in the kiln is closed, reducing the amount of oxygen the pottery receives, this causes both the slip and pot to turn black.
*'''Phase Three''': Re-oxidizing. Oxygen is then released back into the kiln, causing the coarser material to turn red and the smother silica-laden slip to remain black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stubbings|first=F. H.|title=the Mycenaean Pottery of Attica|journal=The Annual of the British School of Athens|year=1947|volume=42|pages=94|jstor=30096719}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Artists used a variety of tools to engrave designs and pictures onto the pottery. Most of the tools used were made up of stones, sticks, bones and thin metal picks. Artists used boar-hair brushes and feathers used to distribute the sifted clay evenly on the pottery.

==Art history==

===Forms of pottery===

There are many different and distinct forms of pottery that can have either very specific or multi-functional purposes. The majority of forms, however are for holding or transporting liquids.

The form of a vessel can help determine where it was made, and what it was most likely used for. Ethnographic analogy and experimental [[archaeology]] have recently become popular ways to date a vessel and discover its function.

====Anatomy====
[[File:Anatomy of a Vessel.jpg|thumb|Anatomy of a typical Mycenaean vessel]]
The anatomy of a vessel can be separated into three distinct parts: '''orifice''', '''body''' and '''base'''. There are many different shapes depending on where the vessel was made, and when.

The '''body''' is the area between the orifice (opening) and base (bottom). The maximum diameter of a vessel is usually at the middle of the body or a bit higher. There are not many differences in the body; the shape is pretty standard throughout the Mycenaean world.

The '''orifice''' is mouth of the vessel, and is subject to many different embellishments, mostly for functional use. The opening is further divided into two categories:
*'''Unrestricted:''' an unrestricted orifice is when the opening is equal to or greater than the maximum diameter.
*'''Restricted:''' contrarily, is when the opening is less than the maximum diameter.

The space between the orifice and the body can be divided into two specific shapes:
*'''Neck:''' a restriction of the opening that is above the maximum diameter.
*'''Collar:''' an extension of the opening that does not reduce the orifice.

The '''base''' is the underside of the vessel. It is generally flat or slightly rounded so that it can rest on its own, but certain wares (especially of the elite variety) have been known to be extremely rounded or pointed.

====Shapes====

There are many different shapes of pottery found from the Mycenaean world. They can serve very specific tasks or be used for different purposes. Some popular uses for pottery at this time are: saucepans, storage containers, ovens, frying pans, stoves, cooking pots, drinking cups and plates.

Some shapes with specific functions are:
*''Stamnos:'' a wine jar
*''Krateriskos:'' miniature mixing bowl
*''Aryballos, Lekythoi, Alabastra:'' for holding precious liquids

Many shapes can be used for a variety of things, such as jugs (''oinochoai'') and cups (''kylikes''). Some, however, have very limited uses; such as the ''kyathos'' which is used solely to transfer wine into these jugs and cups.

Throughout the different phases of Mycenaean pottery different shapes have risen and fallen in prominence. Others evolve from previous forms (for example, the [[Kylix (drinking cup)]] evolved from the Ephyraean goblet).&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, A. D. Greek Pottery in the Bronze Age. London: Methuen, 1967. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ephyrean goblet=====

This goblet is the finest product of a Mycenaean potter's craft. It is a stout, short stemmed goblet that is [[Cretan]] in origin with [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] treatment. Its decoration is confined to the center of each side and directly under the handles.

=====Stirrup jar=====

The [[stirrup jar]] is used for storage and transportation, most commonly of oil and wine that was invented in [[Crete]]. Its body can be [[globular]], [[pear-shaped]] or [[cylindrical]]. The top has a solid bar of clay shaped in two stirrup handles and a spout.

=====Alabastron=====

The [[alabastron]] is the second most popular shape (behind the [[stirrup jar]]). It is a squat jar with two to three ribbon-handles at the opening.

====Function====
[[File:Vessel function.jpg|thumb|upright=0.56| Different vessel functions]]

Vessel function can be broken down into three main categories: '''storage''', '''transformation/processing''' and '''transfer'''. These three categories can be further broken down by asking questions such as: 
*hot or cold?
*liquid or dry?
*frequency of transactions?
*duration of use?
*distance carried

The main problem with pottery is that it is very fragile. While well-fired clay is virtually indestructible, if bumped or dropped it will shatter. Other than this, it is very useful in keeping rodents and insects out and as it can be set directly into a fire it is very popular.

There are a few different classes of pottery, generally separated into two main sections: utilitarian and elite. '''Utilitarian''' pottery is generally plainwares, sometimes with decorations, made for functional, domestic use, and constitutes the bulk of the pottery made. '''Elite''' pottery is finely made and elaborately decorated with great regard for detail. This form of pottery is generally made for holding precious liquids and for decoration.

===Geometric style===

The geometric style of decorating pottery has been popular since [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] times. Although it did decrease in abundance for some time, it resurfaced c. 1000 BC. This form of decoration consists of light clay and a dark, lustrous slip of design. Around 900 BC it became very popular in [[Athens]] and different motifs; such as abstract animals and humans began to appear. Among the popular shapes for geometric pottery are:
* Circles
* Checkers
* Triangles
* Zigzags
* [[Meander (art)]]

===Production centers===

The two main production centers during [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] times were Athens and [[Corinth]]. Attributing pottery to these two cities is done based on two distinct and different characteristics: shapes (and color) and detailed decoration.

In Athens the clay fired rich red and decorations tended towards the geometric style. In Corinth the clay was light yellow in color and they got their motifs from more natural inspirations.

===Phylakopi classification===

This classification system is based on the Mycenaean pottery found at the third city of [[Phylakopi]] on the island of [[Milos]]. This has been divided into four phases

# In this first phase, black matte decoration is the only style to be found. Popular motifs are straight bands, spirals, birds and fish.
# Red and brown lustrous decoration come into play alongside black matte in this phase. Birds and fish are still popular, and we start to see flowers painted on wares as well.
# In this phase both red and brown lustrous and black matte are still around, but the lustrous decorations have surpassed the matte in popularity. The flower becomes much more popular.
# Red/Black and Red lustrous are still seen in this final phase, and black matte has completely disappeared. Shape and decorative motifs do not change much during this phase.&lt;ref&gt;Dussaud, René. René Dussaud. Les Civilisations Préhelléniques Dans Le Bassin De La Mer Egée. 2e édition Revue Et Augmentée. Paris, P. Geuthner, 1914. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lustrous painted wares===

Lustrous painted wares slowly rise in popularity throughout the Late Helladic period until eventually they are the most popular for of painted wares. There are four distinct forms of lustrous decorations:
# The first style sees the ware covered entirely with brilliant decoration, with red or white matte paint underneath.
# This form consists of wares with a yellower tone with black lustrous decorations.
# In the third style, the yellow clay becomes paler and floral and marine motifs in black paint are popular.
# The final style has matte red clay with a less lustrous black paint. Human and animal decorations that are geometric in form.

===Fine wares vs. common wares===

'''Fine wares''' are made from well purified clay of a buff color. They have thin, hard walls and a smooth, well polished slip. The paint is generally lustrous and the decorations can be: 
* Birds
* Fish
* Animals (commonly oxen and horses)
* Humans

This form of ware is generally of a high class; making it more expensive and elite.

'''Common wares''' are plain and undecorated wares used for everyday tasks. They are made from a red coarse and porous clay and often contain grit to prevent cracking. Later on in the Helladic period the tendency to decorate even common wares surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;French, Elizabeth B., and Alan J. Wace. Excavations at Mycenae: 1939-1955. [London]: Thames and Hudson, 1979. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pattern vs. pictorial style===

====Pattern====

The pattern style is characterized by motifs such as:
* scales
*spirals
*chevrons
*octopuses
*shells
*flowers

Throughout the Late Helladic era, the patterns become more and more simplified until they are little more than calligraphic squiggles. The [[vase painter]] would cover the majority of the vase with horizontal bands, applied while the pottery was still on the wheel. There is a distinct lack of invention in this form of decoration. 
&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Reynold Alleyne. Minoan and Mycenaean Art. London: Thames and Hudson, 1967. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pictorial====

The majority of pictorial pottery has been found on Cyprus, but it originates in the [[Peloponnese]]. It is most likely copied or inspired from the palace [[frescoes]] but the vase painters lacked the ability at this time to recreate the fluidity of the art.

The most common shape for this form of decoration are large jars, providing a larger surface for the decoration; usually chariot scenes.

==Society and culture==
[[Sub-Mycenaean pottery|Submycenaean]] is now generally regarded as the final stage of Late Helladic IIIC (and perhaps not even a very significant one), and is followed by [[Protogeometric art|Protogeometric]] pottery (1050/25–900 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Dickinson, ''The Aegean from Bronze Age to Iron Age'', London 2006, 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence for a [[Dorian invasion]] at any time between 1200 and 900 BC is absent, nor can any pottery style be associated with the [[Dorians]].

[[Dendrochronology|Dendrochronological]] and C14 evidence for the start of the Protogeometric period now indicates this should be revised upwards to at least 1070 BC, if not earlier.&lt;ref&gt;http://dendro.cornell.edu/articles/newton2005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The remnants of Mycenaean pottery allow [[archaeologist]]s to date the site they have excavated. With the estimated time of the site, this allows [[historian]]s to develop timelines that contribute to the understanding of ancient civilization. Furthermore, with the extraction of pottery, historians can determine the different classes of people depending on where the pottery shards were taken from. Due to the large amount of trading the Mycenae people did, tracking whom they traded with can determine the extent of their power and influence in their society and others. Historians then can learn the importance of who the Mycenae people were, where pottery mainly comes from, who was reigning at that time and the different economic standards.

Historians don't know why the power of dominance changed from the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]s to the Mycenaes, but much of the influence of pottery comes from the Minoans' culture. Shapes as well as design are direct influences from the Minoans. The Mycenae didn't change the design of their pottery all that much, but the development of the [[stirr-up jar]] became a  huge influence on other communities. Fresco paintings became an influence on the pictures painted on the pottery. Most of these images depict the warlike attitude of the Mycenae; as well, animals became a common feature painted on the pottery.

Through the excavation of [[tombs]] in [[Greece]], [[archaeologist]]s believe that much of the pottery found belongs to the upper class. Pottery was seen as slave work or that of the lower class. Graves with few pots or vessels indicate the burial was for a poorer family; these are usually not of much worth and are less elaborate then that of the higher class. Pottery was used for ceremonies or gifts to other rulers in the Mycenaean cities.

For historians to decipher what pottery was used for, they have to look for different physical characteristics that would indicate what it was used for. Some indicators can be:
* Where the pottery was extracted from (i.e., houses, [[graves]], [[temples]])
* Dimension and shape: what the capacity is, stability, manipulation and how easy it is to extract its content
* Surface wear: scratches, pits or chips resulting from stirring, carrying, serving and washing
* Soot deposit: if it was used for cooking

Pottery was mainly used for the storage of [[water]], [[wine]] and [[olive oil]] and for cooking. Pottery was also "used as a prestige object to display success or power".&lt;ref&gt;Tite, M.S. ''Ceramic Production, Provenience And Use — A Review''. dcr.webprod.fct.unl.pt/laboratorios-e-atelies/4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Most grave sites contain pottery to serve as a passing into another life. Along with burial rituals and gifts, pottery was widely traded.

Much of the Mycenae's wealth came from the trading they did along the coast of the [[Mediterranean]]. When power passed from the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]s to the Mycenae, [[Crete]] and [[Rhodes]] became major trading points. Trading eventually moved further north, as far as [[Mount Olympus]]. With the growing power and influence, trading went as far as [[Egypt]], [[Sicily]], and the coast of [[Italy]]. Other sites where pottery was discovered are [[Baltic region|Baltic]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Spain]], and most of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. Another society that the Mycenae traded with were the [[Neolithic]]. Around 1250&amp;nbsp;BC, the Mycenae combined forces to take over [[Troy]] due to high taxation of ships through the channel among other reasons. With the coming of the Bronze Age Collapse, famine became more prevalent and many families moved to places closer to food production around the Eastern Mediterranean. With a declining population, production of pottery also declined. Pottery did not become a lost art form like many others, but it became more rugged.

With the establishment of trade, prices were agreed upon before ships were sent out.&lt;ref name="Mycenaean Pottery"&gt;Wijngaarden, Gert Jan Van. ''Use and Appreciation of Mycenaean Pottery in the Levant, Cyprus and Italy (1600-1200 B.C.)'', Amsterdam University Press, 2002. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Other materials such as olive oil, wine, fabrics and copper were traded.

'''Neoclassicism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] νέος ''nèos'', "new" and [[Latin]] ''classicus'', "of the highest rank")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=neo-classical| title=Etymology of the English word "neo-classical"| accessdate=2016-05-09| publisher=myetymology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the name given to Western [[Cultural movement|movements]] in the decorative and visual arts, literature, theatre, music, and architecture that draw inspiration from the "classical" art and culture of [[classical antiquity]]. Neoclassicism was born largely thanks to the writings of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], at the time of the rediscovery of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], but its popularity spread all over Europe as a generation of European art students finished their [[Grand Tour]] and returned from Italy to their home countries with newly rediscovered Greco-Roman ideals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1189&amp;dq=neoclassicism+originated+in.Rome&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCl9eT0cLVAhVLDcAKHSy7B1cQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=neoclassicism%20originated%20in.Rome&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/artdok/volltexte/2010/978 The road from Rome to Paris. The birth of a modern Neoclassicism]&lt;/ref&gt; The main Neoclassical movement coincided with the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment]], and continued into the early 19th century, laterally competing with [[Romanticism]]. In architecture, the style continued throughout the 19th, 20th and up to the 21st century.

European Neoclassicism in the [[visual art]]s began c. 1760 in opposition to the then-dominant [[Rococo]] style. Rococo architecture emphasizes grace, ornamentation and asymmetry; Neoclassical architecture is based on the principles of simplicity and symmetry, which were seen as virtues of the arts of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece]], and were more immediately drawn from 16th-century [[Renaissance|Renaissance Classicism]]. Each "neo"-classicism selects some models among the range of possible classics that are available to it, and ignores others. The Neoclassical writers and talkers, patrons and collectors, artists and sculptors of 1765–1830 paid homage to an ''idea'' of the generation of [[Phidias]], but the sculpture examples they actually embraced were more likely to be Roman copies of Hellenistic sculptures. They ignored both Archaic Greek art and the works of [[Late Antiquity]]. The "Rococo" art of ancient [[Palmyra]] came as a revelation, through engravings in Wood's ''The Ruins of Palmyra''. Even Greece was all-but-unvisited, a rough backwater of the [[Ottoman Empire]], dangerous to explore, so Neoclassicists' appreciation of Greek architecture was mediated through drawings and engravings, which subtly smoothed and regularized, "corrected" and "restored" the monuments of Greece, not always consciously.

==History==
Neoclassicism is a revival of the many styles and spirit of classic antiquity inspired directly from the classical period,&lt;ref name=Irwin&gt;{{cite book |title = Neoclassicism A&amp;I (Art and Ideas)| last=Irwin| first=David G.| publisher =  Phaidon Press|year = 1997 | pages = | isbn=978-0-7148-3369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which coincided and reflected the developments in [[philosophy]] and other areas of the Age of  Enlightenment, and was initially a reaction against the excesses of the preceding [[Rococo]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 17-25; Novotny, 21&lt;/ref&gt; While the movement is often described as the opposed counterpart of [[Romanticism]], this is a great over-simplification that tends not to be sustainable when specific artists or works are considered. The case of the supposed main champion of late Neoclassicism, [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], demonstrates this especially well.&lt;ref&gt;A recurring theme in Clark: 19-23, 58-62, 69, 97-98 (on Ingres); Honour, 187-190; Novotny, 86-87&lt;/ref&gt; The revival can be traced to the establishment of formal archaeology.&lt;ref name=Lingo&gt;{{cite book |title = François Duquesnoy and the Greek ideal| last=Lingo| first=Estelle Cecile| publisher = Yale University Press; First Edition|year = 2007| pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wlq67ikF0OEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=Winckelmann+Neoclassicism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zGxFT-GiPMHWiAKY_dypDg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Winckelmann%20Neoclassicism&amp;f=false 161]| isbn=978-0-300-12483-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Classical Savannah: fine &amp; decorative arts, 1800-1840| last=Talbott | first=Page| publisher = University of Georgia Press |year = 1995| pages = 6| isbn=978-0-8203-1793-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|left|250|Johann Joachim Winckelmann, often called "the father of archaeology"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Culture and values: a survey of the humanities| last=Cunningham, Reich| first= Lawrence S., John J. | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing; 7 edition|year = 2009| pages = 104 | isbn=978-0-495-56877-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The writings of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] were important in shaping this movement in both architecture and the visual arts. His books ''Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture'' (1750) and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums'' ("History of Ancient Art", 1764) were the first to distinguish sharply between Ancient Greek and Roman art, and define periods within Greek art, tracing a trajectory from growth to maturity and then imitation or decadence that continues to have influence to the present day. Winckelmann believed that art should aim at "noble simplicity and calm grandeur",&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 57-62, 61 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; and praised the idealism of Greek art, in which he said we find "not only nature at its most beautiful but also something beyond nature, namely certain ideal forms of its beauty, which, as an ancient interpreter of [[Plato]] teaches us, come from images created by the mind alone". The theory was very far from new in Western art, but his emphasis on close copying of Greek models was: "The only way for us to become great or if this be possible, inimitable, is to imitate the ancients".&lt;ref&gt;Both quotes from the first pages of "Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture"&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of the [[Grand Tour]], a fad of collecting [[antiquities]] began that laid the foundations of many great collections spreading a Neoclassical revival throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = In Pursuit of Ancient Pasts: A History of Classical Archaeology in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries| last= Dyson| first=Stephen L.| publisher = Yale University Press |year = 2006| pages = xii | isbn=978-0-300-11097-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Neoclassicism" in each art implies a particular canon of a "classical" model.

In English, the term "Neoclassicism" is used primarily of the visual arts; the similar movement in [[English literature]], which began considerably earlier, is called [[Augustan literature]]. This, which had been dominant for several decades, was beginning to decline by the time Neoclassicism in the visual arts became fashionable. Though terms differ, the situation in French literature was similar. In music, the period saw the rise of [[classical music]], and "Neoclassicism" is used of [[Neoclassicism (music)|20th-century developments]]. However, the operas of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] represented a specifically Neoclassical approach, spelt out in his preface to the published score of ''[[Alceste (Gluck)|Alceste]]'' (1769), which aimed to reform opera by removing [[ornamentation (music)|ornamentation]], increasing the role of the chorus in line with [[Greek tragedy]], and using simpler unadorned melodic lines.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mengs, Urteil des Paris.jpg|thumb|[[Anton Raphael Mengs]], ''[[Judgement of Paris]]'', c. 1757, bought by [[Catherine the Great]] from the studio]]

The term "Neoclassical" was not invented until the mid-19th century, and at the time the style was described by such terms as "the true style", "reformed" and "revival"; what was regarded as being revived varying considerably. Ancient models were certainly very much involved, but the style could also be regarded as a revival of the [[Renaissance]], and especially in France as a return to the more austere and noble [[Baroque]] of the age of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], for which a considerable nostalgia had developed as France's dominant military and political position started a serious decline.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 11, 23-25&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s coronation portrait of Napoleon even borrowed from Late Antique [[consular diptych]]s and their [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] revival, to the disapproval of critics.

Neoclassicism was strongest in [[architecture]], [[sculpture]] and the [[decorative arts]], where classical models in the same medium were relatively numerous and accessible; examples from ancient painting that demonstrated the qualities that Winckelmann's writing found in sculpture were and are lacking. Winckelmann was involved in the dissemination of knowledge of the first large Roman paintings to be discovered, at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] and, like most contemporaries except for [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], was unimpressed by them, citing [[Pliny the Younger]]'s comments on the decline of painting in his period.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 44-46; Novotny, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

As for painting, Greek painting was utterly lost: Neoclassicist painters imaginatively revived it, partly through bas-relief friezes, mosaics and pottery painting, and partly through the examples of painting and decoration of the High Renaissance of [[Raphael]]'s generation, frescos in Nero's ''[[Domus Aurea]]'', [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], and through renewed admiration of [[Nicholas Poussin]]. Much "Neoclassical" painting is more classicizing in subject matter than in anything else. A fierce, but often very badly informed, dispute raged for decades over the relative merits of Greek and Roman art, with Winckelmann and his fellow Hellenists generally the winning side.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 43-62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting and printmaking==
[[File:(20) Flaxman Ilias 1795, Zeichnung 1793, 194 x 338 mm.jpg|thumb|Print of a drawing by [[John Flaxman]] of a scene in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', 1795]]

It is hard to recapture the radical and exciting nature of early Neoclassical painting for contemporary audiences; it now strikes even those writers favourably inclined to it as "insipid" and "almost entirely uninteresting to us"—some of [[Kenneth Clark]]'s comments on [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]' ambitious ''Parnassus'' at the [[Villa Albani]],&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 20 (quoted); Honour, 14; [[:File:Mengs Parnasus.jpg|image of the painting]] (in fairness, other works by Mengs are more successful)&lt;/ref&gt; by the artist who his friend Winckelmann described as "the greatest artist of his own, and perhaps of later times".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 31-32 (31 quoted)&lt;/ref&gt; The drawings, subsequently turned into [[old master print|prints]], of [[John Flaxman]] used very simple line drawing (thought to be the purest classical medium&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 113-114&lt;/ref&gt;) and figures mostly in profile to depict ''[[The Odyssey]]'' and other subjects, and once "fired the artistic youth of Europe" but are now "neglected",&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 14&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[history painting]]s of [[Angelica Kauffman]], mainly a portraitist, are described as having "an unctuous softness and tediousness" by [[Fritz Novotny]].&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 62&lt;/ref&gt;  Rococo frivolity and Baroque movement had been stripped away but many artists struggled to put anything in their place, and in the absence of ancient examples for history painting, other than the [[Ancient Greek pottery|Greek vases]] used by Flaxman, [[Raphael]] tended to be used as a substitute model, as Winckelmann recommended. 
[[File:David-Oath of the Horatii-1784.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacques-Louis David]], ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'', 1784]]

The work of other artists, who could not easily be described as insipid, combined aspects of Romanticism with a generally Neoclassical style, and form part of the history of both movements.  The German-Danish painter [[Asmus Jacob Carstens]] finished very few of the large mythological works that he planned, leaving mostly drawings and colour studies which often succeed in approaching Winckelmann's prescription of "noble simplicity and calm grandeur".&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 51-54&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Carstens' unrealized schemes, the [[etching]]s of [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]] were numerous and profitable, and taken back by those making the [[Grand Tour]] to all parts of Europe. His main subject matter was the buildings and ruins of Rome, and he was more stimulated by the ancient than the modern. The somewhat disquieting atmosphere of many of his ''Vedute'' (views) becomes dominant in his series of 16 prints of ''Carceri d'Invenzione'' ("Imaginary Prisons") whose "oppressive cyclopean architecture" conveys "dreams of fear and frustration".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 45-58 (47-48 quoted); Honour, 50-57&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss-born [[Henry Fuseli|Johann Heinrich Füssli]] spent most of his career in England, and while his fundamental style was based on Neoclassical principles, his subjects and treatment more often reflected the "Gothic" strain of [[Romanticism]], and sought to evoke drama and excitement.

Neoclassicism in painting gained a new sense of direction with the sensational success of [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'' at the [[Paris Salon|Paris Salon of 1785]]. Despite its evocation of republican virtues, this was a commission by the royal government, which David insisted on painting in Rome. David managed to combine an idealist style with drama and forcefulness. The central perspective is perpendicular to the picture plane, made more emphatic by the dim arcade behind, against which the heroic figures are disposed as in a [[frieze]], with a hint of the artificial lighting and staging of [[opera]], and the classical colouring of [[Nicholas Poussin]]. David rapidly became the leader of French art, and after the [[French Revolution]] became a politician with control of much government patronage in art. He managed to retain his influence in the [[Napoleon]]ic period, turning to frankly propagandistic works, but had to leave France for exile in Brussels at the [[Bourbon Restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 34-37; Clark, 21-26; Novotny, 19-22&lt;/ref&gt;

David's many students included [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], who saw himself as a classicist throughout his long career, despite a mature style that has an equivocal relationship with the main current of Neoclassicism, and many later diversions into [[Orientalism]] and the [[Troubadour style]] that are hard to distinguish from those of his unabashedly Romantic contemporaries, except by the primacy his works always give to drawing. He exhibited at the Salon for over 60 years, from 1802 into the beginnings of [[Impressionism]], but his style, once formed, changed little.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 39-47;Clark, 97-145; Honour, 187-190&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture==

If Neoclassical painting suffered from a lack of ancient models, Neoclassical sculpture tended to suffer from an excess of them, although examples of actual Greek sculpture of the "classical period" beginning in about 500 BC were then very few; the most highly regarded works were mostly Roman copies.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 378&lt;/ref&gt; The leading Neoclassical sculptors enjoyed huge reputations in their own day, but are now less regarded, with the exception of [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], whose work was mainly portraits, very often as busts, which do not sacrifice a strong impression of the sitter's personality to idealism. His style became more classical as his long career continued, and represents a rather smooth progression from Rococo charm to classical dignity. Unlike some Neoclassical sculptors he did not insist on his sitters wearing Roman dress, or being unclothed. He portrayed most of the great figures of the Enlightenment, and travelled to America to produce a [[George Washington (Houdon)|statue of George Washington]], as well as busts of [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Benjamin Franklin|Ben Franklin]] and other luminaries of the new republic.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 378–379&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chinard, Gilbert, ed., Houdon in America'' Arno PressNy, 1979, a reprint of a book published by Johns Hopkins University, 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonio Canova]] and the Dane [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]] were both based in Rome, and as well as portraits produced many ambitious life-size figures and groups; both represented the strongly idealizing tendency in Neoclassical sculpture. Canova has a lightness and grace, where Thorvaldsen is more severe; the difference is exemplified in their respective groups of the ''Three Graces''.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 379-384&lt;/ref&gt; All these, and Flaxman, were still active in the 1820s, and Romanticism was slow to impact sculpture, where versions of Neoclassicism remained the dominant style for most of the 19th century.

An early Neoclassicist in sculpture was the Swede [[Johan Tobias Sergel]].&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 384-385&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Flaxman]] was also, or mainly, a sculptor, mostly producing severely classical reliefs that are comparable in style to his prints; he also designed and modelled Neoclassical ceramics for [[Josiah Wedgwood]] for several years. [[Johann Gottfried Schadow]] and his son [[Rudolph Schadow|Rudolph]], one of the few Neoclassical sculptors to die young, were the leading German artists,&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 388-389&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Franz Anton von Zauner]] in Austria. The late Baroque Austrian sculptor [[Franz Xaver Messerschmidt]] turned to Neoclassicism in mid-career, shortly before he appears to have suffered some kind of mental crisis, after which he retired to the country and devoted himself to the highly distinctive "character heads" of bald figures pulling extreme facial expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 390-392&lt;/ref&gt; Like Piranesi's ''Carceri'', these enjoyed a great revival of interest during the age of [[psychoanalysis]] in the early 20th century. The Dutch Neoclassical sculptor [[Mathieu Kessels]] studied with Thorvaldsen and worked almost exclusively in Rome.

Since prior to the 1830s the United States did not have a sculpture tradition of its own, save in the areas of tombstones, weathervanes and ship figureheads,&lt;ref&gt;Gerdts, William H., ''American Neo-Classic Sculpture: The Marble Resurrection'',  Viking Press, New York, 1973 p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; the European Neoclassical manner was adopted there, and it was to hold sway for decades and is exemplified in the sculptures of  [[Horatio Greenough]], [[Hiram Powers]], [[Randolph Rogers]] and [[William Henry Rinehart]].

==Architecture and the decorative arts==

Neoclassicism first gained influence in England and France, through a generation of French art students trained in Rome and influenced by the writings of Winckelmann, and it was quickly adopted by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden and Russia. At first, classicizing decor was grafted onto familiar European forms, as in the interiors for [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]]'s lover, [[Grigory Orlov|Count Orlov]], designed by an Italian architect with a team of Italian ''[[stucco|stuccadori]]'': only the isolated oval medallions like cameos and the [[bas-relief]] overdoors hint of Neoclassicism; the furnishings are fully Italian Rococo.

A second Neoclassic wave, more severe, more studied (through the medium of [[engraving]]s) and more consciously archaeological, is associated with the height of the [[Napoleon|Napoleonic Empire]]. In France, the first phase of Neoclassicism was expressed in the "Louis XVI style", and the second in the styles called "Directoire" or [[Empire style|Empire]]. The Rococo style remained popular in Italy until the Napoleonic regimes brought the new archaeological classicism, which was embraced as a political statement by young, progressive, urban Italians with republican leanings.{{according to whom|date=March 2013}}

In the decorative arts, Neoclassicism is exemplified in Empire furniture made in Paris, London, New York, Berlin; in [[Biedermeier]] furniture made in Austria; in [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]'s museums in Berlin, Sir [[John Soane]]'s Bank of England in London and the newly built "[[United States Capitol|capitol]]" in Washington, D.C.; and in [[Josiah Wedgwood|Wedgwood]]'s [[bas relief]]s and "black basaltes" [[vase]]s. The style was international; Scots architect [[Charles Cameron (architect)|Charles Cameron]] created palatial Italianate interiors for the German-born [[Catherine II the Great]], in Russian St. Petersburg.

Indoors, Neoclassicism made a discovery of the genuine classic interior, inspired by the rediscoveries at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. These had begun in the late 1740s, but only achieved a wide audience in the 1760s,&lt;ref name="Gontar"&gt;Gontar&lt;/ref&gt; with the first luxurious volumes of tightly controlled distribution of ''[[Le Antichità di Ercolano]]'' (''The Antiquities of Herculaneum''). The antiquities of Herculaneum showed that even the most classicizing interiors of the [[Baroque]], or the most "Roman" rooms of [[William Kent]] were based on [[basilica]] and [[temple]] exterior architecture turned outside in, hence their often bombastic appeatrance to modern eyes: [[pediment]]ed window frames turned into [[gilding|gilded]] mirrors, fireplaces topped with temple fronts. The new interiors sought to recreate an authentically Roman and genuinely interior vocabulary. Techniques employed in the style included flatter, lighter motifs, sculpted in low [[frieze]]-like relief or painted in monotones ''[[Camaïeu|en camaïeu]]'' ("like cameos"), isolated medallions or vases or busts or ''[[bucrania]]'' or other motifs, suspended on swags of laurel or ribbon, with slender arabesques against backgrounds, perhaps, of "Pompeiian red" or pale tints, or stone colors. The style in France was initially a Parisian style, the ''[[Goût grec]]'' ("Greek style"), not a court style; when [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] acceded to the throne in 1774, [[Marie Antoinette]], his fashion-loving Queen, brought the "Louis XVI" style to court. However, there was no real attempt to employ the basic forms of Roman furniture until around the turn of the century, and furniture-makers were more likely to borrow from ancient architecture, just as silversmiths were more likely to take from ancient pottery and stone-carving than metalwork: "Designers and craftsmen ... seem to have taken an almost perverse pleasure in transferring motifs from one medium to another".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 110–111, 110 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Château de Malmaison - Appartement de Joséphine 003.jpg|thumb|[[Château de Malmaison]], 1800, room for the [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Empress Joséphine]], on the cusp between [[Directoire style]] and [[Empire style]]]]

From about 1800 a fresh influx of Greek architectural examples, seen through the medium of etchings and engravings, gave a new impetus to Neoclassicism, the [[Greek Revival]]. At the same time the [[Empire style]] was a more grandiose wave of Neoclassicism in architecture and the decorative arts. Mainly based on Imperial Roman styles, it originated in, and took its name from, the rule of [[Napoleon]] in the [[First French Empire]], where it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The style corresponds to the more bourgeois [[Biedermeier]] style in the German-speaking lands, [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] in the United States,&lt;ref name="Gontar"/&gt; the [[Regency style]] in Britain, and the ''Napoleon style'' in Sweden. According to the art historian [[Hugh Honour]] "so far from being, as is sometimes supposed, the culmination of the Neo-classical movement, the Empire marks its rapid decline and transformation back once more into a mere antique revival, drained of all the high-minded ideas and force of conviction that had inspired its masterpieces".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 171–184, 171 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier phase of the style was called the [[Adam style]] in Great Britain and "Louis Seize", or Louis XVI, in France.

Neoclassicism continued to be a major force in [[academic art]] through the 19th century and beyond—a constant antithesis to [[Romanticism]] or [[Gothic revival]]s —, although from the late 19th century on it had often been considered anti-modern, or even reactionary, in influential critical circles.{{who|date=March 2013}} The centres of several European cities, notably [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] and [[Munich]], came to look much like museums of Neoclassical architecture.

Gothic revival architecture (often linked with the Romantic cultural movement), a style originating in the 18th century which grew in popularity throughout the 19th century, contrasted Neoclassicism. Whilst Neoclassicism was characterized by Greek and Roman-influenced styles, geometric lines and order, Gothic revival architecture placed an emphasis on medieval-looking buildings, often made to have a rustic, "romantic" appearance.

==Neoclassical gardens==
In England, Augustan literature had a direct parallel with the Augustan style of landscape design. The links are clearly seen in the work of [[Alexander Pope]]. The best surviving examples of Neoclassical English gardens are [[Chiswick House]], [[Stowe House]] and [[Stourhead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Turner|title=British gardens: history, philosophy and design, Chapter 6 Neoclassical gardens and landscapes 1730-1800|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415518789|pages=456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neoclassicism and fashion==
[[File:Thérésa Cabarrus.JPG|thumb|Revolutionary socialite [[Thérésa Tallien]]]]
[[File:5th Duke of Bedford.png|thumb|[[Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford]] in a [[Bedford Crop]]]]
In fashion, Neoclassicism influenced the much greater simplicity of women's dresses, and the long-lasting fashion for white, from well before the French Revolution, but it was not until after it that thorough-going attempts to imitate ancient styles became fashionable in France, at least for women. Classical costumes had long been worn by fashionable ladies posing as some figure from Greek or Roman myth in a portrait (in particular there was a rash of such portraits of the young model [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]] from the 1780s), but such costumes were only worn for the portrait sitting and [[masquerade ball]]s until the Revolutionary period, and perhaps, like other exotic styles, as undress at home. But the styles worn in portraits by [[Juliette Récamier]], [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]], [[Thérésa Tallien]] and other Parisian trend-setters were for going-out in public as well. Seeing Mme Tallien at the opera, [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]] quipped that: "''Il n'est pas possible de s'exposer plus somptueusement!''" ("One could not be more sumptuously undressed"). In 1788, just before the Revolution, the court portraitist [[Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun]] had held a Greek supper where the ladies wore plain white Grecian tunics.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 244&lt;/ref&gt; Shorter classical hairstyles, where possible with curls, were less controversial and very widely adopted, and hair was now uncovered even outdoors; except for evening dress, [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]]s or other coverings had typically been worn even indoors before. Thin Greek-style ribbons or fillets were used to tie or decorate the hair instead.

Very light and loose dresses, usually white and often with shockingly bare arms, rose sheer from the ankle to just below the bodice, where there was a strongly emphasized thin hem or tie round the body, often in a different colour. The shape is now often known as the [[Empire silhouette]] although it predates the [[First French Empire]] of Napoleon, but his first Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais was influential in spreading it around Europe. A long rectangular shawl or wrap, very often plain red but with a decorated border in portraits, helped in colder weather, and was apparently laid around the midriff when seated—for which sprawling semi-recumbent postures were favoured.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 244-245&lt;/ref&gt;  By the start of the 19th century, such styles had spread widely across Europe.

Neoclassical fashion for men was far more problematic, and never really took off other than for hair, where it played an important role in the shorter styles that finally despatched the use of wigs, and then white hair-powder, for younger men. The trouser had been the symbol of the barbarian to the Greeks and Romans, but outside the painter's or, especially, the sculptor's studio, few men were prepared to abandon it. Indeed, the period saw the triumph of the pure trouser, or [[trousers|pantaloon]], over the ''cullottes'' or [[knee-breeches]] of the [[Ancien Régime]]. Even when David designed a new French "national costume" at the request of the government during the height of the Revolutionary enthusiasm for changing everything in 1792, it included fairly tight leggings under a coat that stopped above the knee. A high proportion of well-to-do young men spent much of the key period in military service because of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], and military uniform, which began to emphasize jackets that were short at the front, giving a full view of tight-fitting trousers, was often worn when not on duty, and influenced cilivian male styles.

The trouser-problem had been recognised by artists as a barrier to creating contemporary [[history painting]]s; like other elements of contemporary dress they were seen as irredeemably ugly and unheroic by many artists and critics. Various strategems were used to avoid depicting them in modern scenes. In ''[[James Dawkins (antiquarian)|James Dawkins]] and [[Robert Wood (antiquarian)|Robert Wood]] Discovering the Ruins of [[Palmyra]]'' (1758) by [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], the two gentleman antiquaries are shown in [[toga]]-like Arab robes.  In ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' (1778) by [[John Singleton Copley]], the main figure could plausibly be shown nude, and the composition is such that of the eight other men shown, only one shows a single [[breeches|breeched]] leg prominently.  However the Americans Copley and [[Benjamin West]] led the artists who successfully showed that trousers could be used in heroic scenes, with works like West's ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1770) and Copley's ''[[The Death of Major Peirson, 6 January 1781]]'' (1783), although the trouser was still being carefully avoided in ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'', completed in 1819.

Classically inspired male hair styles included the [[Bedford Crop]], arguably the precursor of most plain modern male styles, which was invented by the radical politician [[Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford]] as a protest against a [[Duty on Hair Powder Act 1795|tax on hair powder]]; he encouraged his friends to adopt it by betting them they would not. Another influential style (or group of styles) was named by the French "à la Titus" after [[Titus Junius Brutus]] (not in fact the Roman Emperor [[Titus]] as often assumed), with hair short and layered but somewhat piled up on the crown, often with restrained quiffs or locks hanging down; variants are familiar from the hair of both [[Napoleon]] and [[George IV of England]]. The style was supposed to have been introduced by the actor [[François-Joseph Talma]], who upstaged his wigged co-actors when appearing in productions of works such as [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Brutus (tragedy)|Brutus]]'' (about [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], who orders the execution of his son Titus).  In 1799 a Parisian fashion magazine reported that even bald men were adopting Titus wigs,&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 243&lt;/ref&gt; and the style was also worn by women, the ''[[Journal de Paris]]'' reporting in 1802 that "more than half of elegant women were wearing their hair or wig ''à la Titus''.&lt;ref&gt;Rifelj, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later "Neoclassicisms"==

{{Classicism}}
In American architecture, Neoclassicism was one expression of the [[American Renaissance]] movement, ''ca.'' 1890–1917; its last manifestation was in [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], and its very last, large public projects were the [[Lincoln Memorial]] (highly criticized at the time), the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. (also heavily criticized by the architectural community as being backward thinking and old fashioned in its design), and the [[American Museum of Natural History]]'s Roosevelt Memorial. These were considered stylistic anachronisms when they were finished. In the British Raj, Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]]' monumental city planning for [[New Delhi]] marks the glorious sunset of Neoclassicism. World War II was to shatter most longing for (and imitation of) mythical, heroic times.

Conservative [[modernist]] architects such as [[Auguste Perret]] in France kept the rhythms and spacing of columnar architecture even in factory buildings. Where a [[colonnade]] would have been decried as "reactionary", a building's [[pilaster]]-like [[fluting (architecture)|fluted]] panels under a repeating [[frieze]] looked "progressive". [[Pablo Picasso]] experimented with classicizing motifs in the years immediately following [[World War I]], and the [[Art Deco]] style that came to the fore following the 1925 Paris ''Exposition des Arts Décoratifs'', often drew on Neoclassical motifs without expressing them overtly: severe, blocky [[commode]]s by [[Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann|É.-J. Ruhlmann]] or [[Louis Süe|Süe]] &amp; [[André Mare|Mare]]; crisp, extremely low-relief friezes of damsels and gazelles in every medium; fashionable dresses that were draped or cut on the bias to recreate Grecian lines; the art dance of [[Isadora Duncan]]; the [[Streamline Moderne]] styling of U.S. post offices and county court buildings built as late as 1950; and the [[Dime (United States coin)|Roosevelt dime]].

There was an entire 20th-century movement in the Arts which was also called Neo-classicism. It encompassed at least music, philosophy and literature. It was between the end of World War I and the end of World War II. (For information on the musical aspects, see [[20th century classical music#Neoclassicism|20th-century classical music]] and [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism in music]]. For information on the philosophical aspects, see [[Great Books]].)

This literary Neoclassical movement rejected the extreme romanticism of (for example) [[Dada]], in favour of restraint, religion (specifically Christianity) and a reactionary political program. Although the foundations for this movement in [[English literature]] were laid by [[T. E. Hulme]], the most famous Neoclassicists were [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Wyndham Lewis]]. In Russia, the movement crystallized as early as 1910 under the name of [[Acmeism]], with [[Anna Akhmatova]] and [[Osip Mandelshtam]] as the leading representatives.

===In music===
[[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism in music]] is a 20th-century movement; in this case it is the [[classical music | Classical]] and [[baroque music | Baroque]] musical styles of the 17th and 18th centuries, with their fondness for Greek and Roman themes, that were being revived, not the music of the ancient world itself. (The early 20th century had not yet distinguished the Baroque period in music, on which Neoclassical composers mainly drew, from what we now call the Classical period.) The movement was a reaction  in the first part of the 20th century to the disintegrating chromaticism of late-Romanticism and Impressionism, emerging in parallel with musical Modernism, which sought to abandon key tonality altogether. It manifested a desire for cleanness and simplicity of style, which allowed for quite dissonant paraphrasing of classical procedures, but sought to blow away the cobwebs of Romanticism and the twilit glimmerings of [[Impressionism in music | Impressionism]] in favour of bold rhythms, assertive harmony and clean-cut sectional forms, coinciding with the vogue for reconstructed "classical" dancing and costume in [[ballet]] and [[physical education]]. 

The 17th-18th century dance suite had had a minor revival before [[World War I]] but the Neoclassicists were not altogether happy with unmodified diatonicism, and tended to emphasise the bright dissonance of suspensions and ornaments, the angular qualities of 17th-century modal harmony and the energetic lines of countrapuntal part-writing. [[Respighi, Ottorino | Respighi's]] ''Ancient Airs and Dances'' (1917) led the way for the sort of sound the Neoclassicists aspired to. Although the practice of borrowing musical styles from the past has not been uncommon throughout musical history, art musics have gone through periods where musicians used modern techniques coupled with older forms or harmonies to create new kinds of works. Notable compositional characteristics are: referencing diatonic tonality, conventional forms (dance suites, concerti grossi, sonata forms, etc.), the idea of absolute music untramelled by descriptive or emotive associations, the use of light musical textures, and a conciseness of musical expression. In classical music, this was most notably perceived between the 1920s and the 1950s. [[Igor Stravinsky]] is the best-known composer using this style; he effectively began the musical revolution with his Bach-like [[Octet (Stravinsky)|Octet for Wind Instruments]] (1923). A particular individual work that represents this style well is [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s [[Classical Symphony]] No. 1 in D, which is reminiscent of the symphonic style of [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] or [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. [[Neoclassical ballet]] as innovated by [[George Balanchine]]  de-cluttered the Russian Imperial style in terms of costume, steps and narrative, while also introducing technical innovations.

=== Architecture in Russia and the Soviet Union ===
[[File:Ostdv5.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ostankino Palace]], designed by [[Francesco Camporesi]] and completed in 1798, in Moscow, Russia]]
In 1905–1914 Russian architecture passed through a brief but influential period of [[Russian neoclassical revival|Neoclassical revival]]; the trend began with recreation of Empire style of [[Alexander I of Russia|alexandrine]] period and quickly expanded into a variety of neo-[[Renaissance]], [[palladian architecture|palladian]] and modernized, yet recognizably classical schools. They were led by architects born in the 1870s, who reached creative peak before World War I, like [[Ivan Fomin]], [[Vladimir Shchuko]] and [[Ivan Zholtovsky]]. When economy recovered in the 1920s, these architects and their followers continued working in primarily [[modernism (architecture)|modernist]] environment; some (Zholtovsky) strictly followed the classical canon, others (Fomin, Schuko, [[Ilya Golosov]]) developed their own modernized styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft1g5004bj&amp;brand=eschol |title=The Origins of Modernism in Russian Architecture |publisher=Content.cdlib.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arkhangelskoe Estate Aug2012 buildings 03.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Arkhangelskoye estate]].]]

With the crackdown on architects' independence and official denial of modernism (1932), demonstrated by the international contest for the [[Palace of Soviets]], Neoclassicism was instantly promoted as one of the choices in [[Stalinist architecture]], although not the only one. It coexisted with moderately modernist architecture of [[Boris Iofan]], bordering with contemporary [[Art Deco]] (Schuko); again, the purest examples of the style were produced by Zholtovsky school that remained an isolated phenomena. The political intervention was a disaster for [[Constructivist architecture|constructivist]] leaders yet was sincerely welcomed by architects of the classical schools.

Neoclassicism was an easy choice for the USSR since it did not rely on modern construction technologies ([[steel frame]] or [[reinforced concrete]]) and could be reproduced in traditional [[masonry]]. Thus the designs of Zholtovsky, Fomin and other old masters were easily replicated in remote towns under strict material [[rationing]]. Improvement of construction technology after World War II permitted Stalinist architects to venture into skyscraper construction, although stylistically these skyscrapers (including "exported" architecture of [[Palace of Culture and Science]], [[Warsaw]] and the [[Shanghai]] International Convention Centre) share little with the classical models. Neoclassicism and neo-Renaissance persisted in less demanding residential and office projects until 1955, when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] put an end to expensive Stalinist architecture.

===Architecture in the 21st century===
{{Main|New Classical Architecture}}
[[File:Schermerhorn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]], 2006]]

After a lull during the period of modern architectural dominance (roughly post-World War II until the mid-1980s), Neoclassicism has seen something of a resurgence.

As of the first decade of the 21st century, contemporary Neoclassical architecture is usually classed under the umbrella term of [[New Classical Architecture]]. Sometimes it is also referred to as Neo-Historicism or Traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arch-tour.blogspot.com/2009/03/neo-classicist-architecture.html Neo-classicist Architecture. Traditionalism. Historicism.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a number of pieces of [[postmodern architecture]] draw inspiration from and include explicit references to Neoclassicism, [[Antigone District]] and the [[National Theatre of Catalonia]] in [[Barcelona]] among them. [[Postmodern architecture]] occasionally includes historical elements, like columns, capitals or the tympanum.

For sincere traditional-style architecture that sticks to regional architecture, materials and craftsmanship, the term [[Vernacular architecture|Traditional Architecture]] (or vernacular) is mostly used. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is awarded to major contributors in the field of 21st century traditional or classical architecture, and comes with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/ Driehaus Prize for New Classical Architecture at Notre Dame SoA] – ''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''; retained March 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, various contemporary public buildings are built in Neoclassical style, with the 2006 [[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]] in [[Nashville]] being an example.

In Britain, a number of architects are active in the Neoclassical style. Examples of their work include two university libraries: [[Quinlan Terry]]'s Maitland Robinson Library at [[Downing College]] and Robert Adam Architects' [[Sackler Library]].

The '''Neue Bachgesellschaft''', or New Bach Society, is an organisation based in [[Leipzig]], Germany, devoted to the music of the composer [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].  It was founded in 1900 as the successor to the [[Bach Gesellschaft]], which between 1850 and 1900 produced a complete edition of Bach's works, publishing many pieces for the first time. On completion of these collected works (the ''Bach-Ausgabe''), the original Society dissolved itself.

The new Society approved three enduring projects: 
* the annual edition of a ''Bach-Jahrbuch'' (Bach yearbook)&lt;ref name="Bach Archive"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bach-leipzig.de/index.php?id=173&amp;L=1 | title=Bach Jahrbuch | publisher=[[Bach-Archiv Leipzig|Bach Archive Leipzig]] | accessdate=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* biannual (today: annual) ''Bachfeste'' (Bach festivals). The venues of the Bachfest have mainly been in Germany, but the 2012 Festival had an international dimension, being held in [[Görlitz]]-[[Zgorzelec]] on the [[German-Polish border]].
* the founding of a Bach museum. In 1907 the Society opened the first museum dedicated to Bach at [[Eisenach]], the town where he was born. This [[Bachhaus Eisenach|Bachhaus]] is managed by the ''Bachhaus Eisenach gemeinnützige GmbH'', a registered charitable company, with the New Bach Society as its sole associate.

The Society has not been directly involved in publishing scores in the way that its predecessor was.  However, in 1950 it recommended that the second complete edition of Bach's music be undertaken, the [[Neue Bach-Ausgabe]] (NBA, in English: New Bach Edition). The project was a joint venture of musicologists in Göttingen, then [[West Germany]], and Leipzig, then [[East Germany]], in order to stress that the common cultural heritage was undivisible.

[[Major General]] '''Nguyễn Ngọc Loan''' ({{IPA-vi|ŋʷǐənˀ ŋâwkp lʷāːn|lang}}; 11 December 1930{{spaced ndash}}14 July 1998) was a [[South Vietnam|South Vietnamese]] general and  chief of the South Vietnamese National Police. 

Loan gained international attention when he [[Summary execution|summarily executed]] handcuffed prisoner [[Nguyễn Văn Lém]], on February 1st, 1968 in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]], Vietnam during the [[Tet Offensive]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/photos/iconic-images-vietnam-20658104/image-20658508|title=Stunning AP Images of Vietnam War from Stunning Images of Vietnam War|last=News|first=ABC|website=ABC News|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/2009632258/|title=[Vietcong prisoner, Nguyễn Văn Lém, being executed by police chief General Nguyễn Ngọc Loan in Saigon]|work=The Library of Congress|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nguyễn Văn Lém was a [[Viet Cong|Việt Cộng]] member.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The event was witnessed and recorded by Võ Sửu, a cameraman for [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]], and [[Eddie Adams (photographer)|Eddie Adams]], an [[Associated Press]] photographer. The photo and film became two famous images in contemporary American journalism.
== Early life ==
Loan was born in 1930 to a middle-class family in [[Huế]], and was one of eleven children.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1998/07/16/nguyen-ngoc-loan-dies-at-67/6d360dcf-b95b-451d-ae82-1ecff1607151/|title=NGUYEN NGOC LOAN DIES AT 67|last=Barnes|first=Bart|date=1998-07-16|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied pharmacy at [[Huế University]] before joining the [[Vietnamese National Army]] in 1951. He soon studied at an officer training school, where he befriended classmate [[Nguyễn Cao Kỳ]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Loan received pilot training in Morocco before returning to Vietnam in 1955, serving with the [[South Vietnam Air Force|Vietnamese Air Force]] (VNAF) for the next decade.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

He received additional training in the United States at some point during this period, enabling him to speak English fluently by the time he rose to prominence in the late 1960s. Despite gradually taking on administrative tasks involving intelligence and security, Loan flew as wingman to Kỳ, now commander of the VNAF, during the February 1965 [[Operation Flaming Dart]] airstrikes targeting North Vietnam.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4VG4AQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=nguyen&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=nguyen&amp;f=false|title=The A to Z of the Vietnam War|last=Moise|first=Edwin E.|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2005|isbn=9781461719038|location=Lanham, Maryland|pages=283–284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In June 1965, when Kỳ became prime minister of South Vietnam, he promoted Loan to colonel and appointed him director of the [[Military Security Service]]. This was followed within a few months by an appointment to director of the [[Republic of Vietnam Central Intelligence Organization|Central Intelligence Organization]], giving Loan simultaneous control of both military intelligence and security. He was further made director general of the [[Republic of Vietnam National Police]] in April 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qh5lffww-KsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=loan&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War: A Political, Social, and Military History|last=Tucker|first=Spencer C.|last2=Anh|first2=Ho Dieu|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2011|isbn=9781851099610|edition=2nd|location=Santa Barbara, California|pages=829–830}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holding these positions enabled Loan to wield immense power, and he supervised the suppression of the early 1966 [[Buddhist Uprising|uprising]] of Kỳ's rival General [[Nguyễn Chánh Thi]] and dissident [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; When Kỳ agreed to become vice president to [[Nguyễn Văn Thiệu]] in 1967, the former relied on the support Loan provided for him in order to retain power.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Loan was a staunch South Vietnamese nationalist, refusing to give Americans special treatment in his jurisdiction. For example, he rejected the arrest of a Vietnamese mayor by American military police and insisted that only South Vietnamese authorities could arrest and detain South Vietnamese citizens.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} He also insisted that U.S. civilians, including journalists, fell under South Vietnamese jurisdiction while in Saigon.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Loan's uncompromising stand caused him to be regarded as a troublemaker by the [[Presidency of Lyndon B.

Max Hastings, in his book “Vietnam: An Epic Tragedy, 1945-1975,” notes that the Viet Cong was in civilian clothes and had just cut the throats of a South Vietnamese officer, his wife, their six children and the officer’s 80-year-old mother.

The photograph and footage were broadcast worldwide, galvanizing the anti-war movement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Eddie Adams (photographer)|Eddie Adams]]' photo  won Adams the 1969 [[Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-category/274|title=Pullitzer Prize Winners|last=|first=|date=|website=www.pulitzer.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image became an anti-war icon.

A few months after the execution picture was taken, Loan was seriously wounded near Saigon by machine gun fire that led to the [[amputation]] of his leg. Again his picture hit the world press, this time as Australian war correspondent Pat Burgess carried him back to his lines.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He was evacuated to Australia and then to the United States. Afterwards, Loan remained in the United States for an extended period as Thiệu consolidated his power by replacing Kỳ supporters. Upon his return to Saigon, he was appointed to a position that involved long-range planning, but lacked actual power.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:mop3.JPG|thumb|250px|A box of [[commercial]] oil pastels]] --&gt;
'''Oil pastel''' (also called '''wax oil crayon''') is a painting and drawing medium with characteristics similar to [[pastel]]s and wax [[crayon]]s. Unlike "soft" or "Japanese" pastel sticks, which are made with a gum or [[methyl cellulose]] binder, oil pastels consist of [[pigment]] mixed with a non-drying oil and wax binder. The surface of an oil pastel painting is therefore less powdery, but more difficult to protect with a [[fixative (drawing)|fixative]]. Oil pastels provide a harder edge than "soft" or "French" pastels but are more difficult to blend. 

==History==
[[Image:Oil pastel portrait of a child.JPG|thumb|350px|Portrait of a child made from oil pastels.]]At the end of [[World War I]], [[Kanae Yamamoto (artist)|Kanae Yamamoto]] proposed an overhaul of the [[Japan]]ese education system. He thought that it had been geared too much towards uncritical absorption of information by imitation and wanted to promote a less restraining system, a vision he expounded in his book ''Theory of self-expression'' which described the ''Jiyu-ga'' method, "learning without a teacher". Teachers Rinzo Satake and his brother-in-law Shuku Sasaki read Yamamoto's work and became fanatical supporters. They became keen to implement his ideas by replacing the many hours Japanese children had to spend drawing [[ideogram]]s with black [[Indian ink]] with free drawing hours, filled with as much color as possible. For this, they decided to produce an improved wax crayon and in 1921 founded the  ''[[Sakura Color Products|Sakura Cray-Pas Company]]'' and began production. The new product wasn't completely satisfactory, pigment concentration was low and blending or impasto was impossible, so in 1924 they decided to develop a high viscosity crayon: the oil pastel. This used a mixture of mashed [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]], [[stearic acid]] and [[coconut oil]] as a [[Binder (material)|binder]]. Designed as a relatively cheap, easily applied, colorful medium, oil pastels granted younger artists and students a greater freedom of expression than the expensive chalk-like [[pastels]] normally associated with the fine arts. Until the addition of a stabiliser in 1927, oil pastels came in two types: winter pastels with additional oil to prevent hardening and summer pastels with little oil to avoid melting. [[State school]]s simply couldn't afford the medium and, suspicious of the very idea of "self-expression" in general, favoured the [[coloured pencil]], a cheaper German invention then widely promoted in Europe as a means to instill [[work ethic|work discipline]] in young children.

Oil pastels were an immediate commercial success and other manufacturers were quick to take up the idea, such as Dutch company ''Talens'', who began to produce Panda Pastels in 1930. However, none of these were comparable to the professional quality oil pastels produced today. These early products were intended to introduce [[Western world|west]]ern [[art education]] to Japanese children, and not as a fine arts medium, although Sakura managed to persuade some avant-garde artists to acquaint themselves with the technique, among them [[Pablo Picasso]]. In 1947 Picasso, who for many years had been unable to procure oil pastels because of the [[World War II|war condition]]s, convinced [[Henri Sennelier]], a French manufacturer who specialized in high quality art products, to develop a fine arts version. In 1949 [[Sennelier]] produced the first oil pastels intended for professionals and experienced artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5581725

| accessdate=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These were superior in wax viscosity, texture and pigment quality and capable of producing more consistent and attractive work. The Japanese ''Holbein'' brand of oil pastel appeared in the mid-1980s with both student and professional grades; the latter with a range of 225 colours. Another brand, Caran d'Ache, introduced [[Neocolor]] wax crayons onto the market in 1965, using a patented [[polyethylene]] wax with superior [[lubrication]]; in the nineties these were developed into an oil pastel, [[Neopastel]].

==Use==
Oil pastels can be used directly in dry form; when done lightly, the resulting effects are similar to oil paints. Heavy build-ups can create an almost [[impasto]] effect. Once applied to a surface, the oil pastel pigment can be manipulated with a brush moistened in [[white spirit]], [[turpentine]], [[linseed oil]], or another type of [[vegetable oil]] or [[solvent]]. Alternatively, the drawing surface can be oiled before drawing or the pastel itself can be dipped in oil. Some of these solvents pose serious health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baylor.edu/ehs/index.php?id=94372|title=Section 10: Painting and Drawing|website=Environmental Health &amp; Safety {{!}} Baylor University|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil pastels are considered a fast medium because they are easy to paint with and convenient to carry; for this reason they are often used for sketching, but can also be used for sustained works. Because oil pastels never dry out completely, they need to be protected somehow, often by applying a special [[fixative (drawing)|fixative]] to the painting or placing the painting in a sleeve and then inside a frame. There are some known [[wikt:durability|durability]] problems: firstly, as the oil doesn't dry, it keeps permeating the paper. This process degrades both the paper and the colour layer as it reduces the flexibility of the latter. A second problem is that the stearic acid makes the paper brittle. Lastly both the stearic acid and the wax will be prone to [[efflorescence]] or "wax bloom", the building-up of fatty acids and wax on the surface into an opaque white layer. This is easily made transparent again by gentle polishing with a woolen cloth; but the three effects together result in a colour layer consisting mainly of brittle stearic acid on top of brittle paper, a combination that will crumble easily. A long term concern is simple [[evaporation]]: [[palmitic acid]] is often present and half of it will have evaporated within 40 years; within 140 years half of the stearic acid will have disappeared. Impregnation of the entire art work by [[beeswax]] has been evaluated as a [[Art conservation|conservation]] measure.

==Surface and techniques==

[[Image:Example Scraping Oil pastel.JPG|thumb|150px|An example of the ''scraping down'' technique.]]The surface chosen for oil pastels can have a very dramatic effect on the final painting. Paper is a common surface but this medium can be used on other surfaces including wood, metal, hardboard (often known as "masonite"), [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]], canvas and glass. Many companies make papers specifically for pastels that are suitable for use with oil pastels.

Building up layers of color with the oil pastel, called ''[[Layering (painting)|layering]]'', is a very common technique. Other techniques include ''[[underpainting]]'' and ''scraping down'' or [[sgraffito]]. Turpentine, or similar liquids such as [[mineral spirits]], are often used as a blending tool to create a [[wash (visual arts)|wash]] effect similar to some watercolor paintings. Commercially available oil sketching papers are preferred for such technique.

==Brands==

[[Image:Blended Oil pastel.JPG|thumb|150px|A blended picture using mineral spirits and oil pastels.]]There are a number of types of oil pastels, each of which can be classified as either ''scholastic'', ''student'' or ''professional'' grade.

''Scholastic grade'', for example the Loew Cornell brand, is the lowest grade: generally the oil pastels are harder and less vibrant than higher grades. It is generally meant for children or people starting out with oil pastels, and is fairly cheap compared to other grades, often about [[US$]]5 for a large box. The middle grade, ''student grade'', is meant for art students and can be much more expensive but softer and more vibrant than scholastic grade. They are usually more expensive and cost around $1 to $2 each. An example of a student grade oil pastel is ''Van Gogh'', manufactured by Talens. ''Professional grade'' is the highest grade of oil pastel and can be very expensive, often costing $3 to $5 per oil pastel, but are also the softest and most vibrant. Professional quality brands of oil pastel include Sennelier, Holbein, Garich, and Sakura Specialist.

"'''Ornament and Crime'''" is an essay and lecture by modernist architect [[Adolf Loos]] that criticizes [[ornament (art)|ornament]] in useful objects.

==History==
Contrary to popular belief that it was composed in 1908, Adolf Loos first gave the lecture in 1910 at the Akademischer Verband für Literatur und Musik in Vienna. The essay was then published in 1913 in ''Les Cahiers d’aujourd’hui'' in French as "Ornement et Crime". Only in 1929 was the essay published in German in the ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'', as "Ornament und Verbrechen". It was the architect [[Henry Kulka]], who assisted Loos during a reprint of the essay in 1931 in ''Trotzdem'', that altered the original year to 1908 after he consulted Loos, who either didn't remember well or wanted to assume primacy in the confrontation against the [[Secession (art)|Secessionists]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Long, [http://apps.acsa-arch.org/resources/proceedings/uploads/streamfile.aspx?path=ACSA.AM.85&amp;name=ACSA.AM.85.107.pdf “Ornament, Crime, Myth, and Meaning”], ''85th ACSA Annual Meeting Proceedings, Architecture: Material and Imagined'', 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The essay was written when [[Art Nouveau]]—known as [[Vienna Secession|Secession]] in Austria and which Loos had excoriated even at its height in 1900—was showing a new way forward for modern art. The essay is important in articulating some moralizing views, inherited from the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], which would be fundamental to the [[Bauhaus]] design studio, and would help define the ideology of [[Modern architecture|modernism in architecture]].

"The evolution of culture marches with the elimination of ornament from useful objects," Loos proclaimed, thus linking the optimistic sense of the linear and upward progress of cultures with the contemporary vogue for applying [[evolution]] to cultural contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Jimena Canales, Andrew Herscher, [http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hsdept/bios/docs/canales-Criminal%20Skins.pdf "Criminal Skins: Tattoos and Modern Architecture in the Work of Adolf Loos"], ''Architectural History'' 48, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Loos's work was prompted by regulations he encountered when he designed a tailorshop without ornamentation next to a palace. He eventually conceded to requirements by adding a flowerpot.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |last=Wise|first=Michael |date=4 December 2013 |title=Reassessing an Uproar in Architecture |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/garden/reassessing-an-uproar-in-architecture.html?_r=0 |newspaper=New York Times |location=New York |access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the essay, Loos explains his philosophy, describing how ornamentation can have the effect of causing objects to go out of style and thus become obsolete. It struck him that it was a crime to waste the effort needed to add ornamentation, when the ornamentation would cause the object to soon go out of style. Loos introduced a sense of the "immorality" of ornament, describing it as "degenerate", its suppression as necessary for regulating modern society. He took as one of his examples the [[tattoo]]ing of the "[[Papuan peoples|Papuan]]" and the intense surface decorations of the objects about him—Loos says that, in the eyes of western culture, the Papuan has not evolved to the moral and civilized circumstances of modern man, who, should he tattoo himself, would either be considered a criminal or a degenerate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adolf Loos|year=1908|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~art/Temporary_SL/177/pdfs/Loos.pdf|title=Ornament and Crime|location=Innsbruck, reprint Vienna, 1930|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403175309/http://www2.gwu.edu/~art/Temporary_SL/177/pdfs/Loos.pdf|archivedate=2015-04-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rawson&gt;{{cite book | last = Rawson | first = Jessica | |authorlink= Jessica Rawson |title = Chinese ornament: the lotus and the dragon | publisher = British Museum Publications | location = London | year = 1984 | isbn = 0-7141-1431-6 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loos never argued for the complete absence of ornamentation, but believed that it had to be appropriate to the type of material.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Loos concluded that "No ornament can any longer be made today by anyone who lives on our cultural level ... Freedom from ornament is a sign of spiritual strength".&lt;ref name=rawson/&gt;

'''''Paraphrase E''''' is one of a series of [[avant-garde]] drawings called ''paraphrases'' by [[Ado Vabbe]] in the [[Tartu Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muis.ee/museaalview/1378256 museum record]&lt;/ref&gt;

The drawing shows a set of lines that act as partial contours of possible images, such as faces and the rear end of a horse. Ado Vabbe was the first to bring abstraction to Estonia after studying with [[Vassily Kandinsky]] and [[Franz Marc]] in Munich during the years 1911-1923. The German Expressionist Group [[Der Blaue Reiter]] was to have a great influence on his own work, and his "paraphrases" influenced young artists in Estonia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=r73fmcC5itkC&amp;pg=PA43 Ado Vabbe] discussed by Eda Sepp in ''Estonian Non-conformist art from the Soviet occupation in 1944 to Perestroika'', Chapter 2 in ''Art of the Baltics: The Struggle for Freedom of Artistic Expression under the Soviets, 1945-1991'', edited by Jane Voorhees, Alla Rosenfeld and Norton T.

A '''penciller''' (or '''penciler''') is a [[collaboration]] artist who works in creation of [[comic book]]s, [[graphic novel]]s, and similar visual art forms, with focus on primary pencil illustrations, hence the term "penciller".

In the [[American comic book]] industry, the penciller is the first step in rendering the story in visual form,&lt;ref&gt;[[Fox, Margalit]] (April 5, 2013). [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/06/arts/carmine-infantino-who-revamped-batman-and-the-flash-dies-at-87.html?_r=1&amp; "Carmine Infantino, Reviver of Batman and Flash, Dies at 87"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and may require several steps of feedback with the writer. These artists are concerned with layout (positions and vantages on scenes) to showcase steps in the plot.

==Tools and materials==
A penciller works in [[pencil]]. Beyond this basic description, however, different artists choose to use a wide variety of different tools. While many artists use traditional wood pencils, others prefer [[mechanical pencil]]s or drafting leads. Pencillers may use any lead hardness they wish, although many artists use a harder lead (like a [[2H lead|2H]]) to make light lines for initial sketches, then turn to a slightly softer lead (like a [[HB lead|HB]]) for finishing phases of the drawing. Still other artists do their initial layouts using a [[Non-photo blue|light-blue]] [[colored pencil]] because that color tends to disappear during [[photocopying]].

Most US comic book pages are drawn oversized on large sheets of paper, usually [[Bristol board]].&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, Brian (January 15, 2009). [http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2009/01/15/comic-book-legends-revealed-190/ "Comic Book Legends Revealed #190"]. [[Comic Book Resources]].&lt;/ref&gt; The customary size of comic book pages in the mainstream [[United States|American]] comics industry is 11 by 17 inches. The [[inker]] usually works directly over the penciller's pencil marks, though occasionally pages are inked on [[translucent]] paper, such as drafting [[vellum]], preserving the original pencils. The artwork is later photographically reduced in size during the printing process. With the advent of digital illustration programs such as [[Photoshop]], more and more artwork is produced digitally, either in part or entirely (see below).

==Notable creators and their techniques==
;Jack Kirby
From 1949 until his retirement, [[Jack Kirby]] worked out of a ten-foot-wide basement studio dubbed "The Dungeon" by his family. When starting with clean piece of Bristol board, he would first draw his panel lines with a [[T-square]].&lt;ref name=HeroComplex&gt;Kirby, Neal. "Growing Up Kirby". ''Hero Complex'' (July 2012). ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. pp 22 and 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Arthur Adams
[[Arthur Adams (comics)|Arthur Adams]] begins drawing thumbnail layouts from the script he's given, either at home or in a public place. The thumbnails range in size from 2 inches x 3 inches to half the size of the printed comic book. He or an assistant will then enlarge the thumbnails and trace them onto [[illustration board]] with a [[non-photo blue pencil]], sometimes using a [[Prismacolor]] light-blue pencil, because it is not too waxy, and erases easily. When working on the final illustration board, he does so on a large drawing board when in his basement studio, and a lapboard when sitting on his living room couch. After tracing the thumbnails, he will then clarify details with another light-blue pencil, and finalize the details with a [[Number 2 pencil]]. He drew the first three chapters of "[[Jonni Future]]" at twice the printed comic size, and also drew the fifth chapter, "The Garden of the Sklin", at a size larger than standard, in order to render more detail than usual in those stories. For a large poster image with a multitude of characters, he will go over the figure outlines with a marker in order to emphasize them. He will use photographic reference when appropriate, as when he draws things that he is not accustomed to.&lt;ref name="CBA#17"&gt;Cooke, Jon B. [http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/17adams.html "The Art of Arthur Adams"], Reprinted from ''Comic Book Artist'' #17, November 15, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ModernMasters&gt;George Khoury and Eric Nolen-Weathington. ''Modern Masters Volume Six: Arthur Adams'', 2006, TwoMorrows Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Because a significant portion of his income is derived from selling his original artwork, he is reluctant to learn how to produce his work digitally.&lt;ref&gt;Siuntres, John (September 11, 2013).

;Jim Lee
Artist [[Jim Lee]] is known to use [[Pencil#Grading and classification|F lead]] for his pencil work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Campbell, J. Scott]] (2008). [http://j-scott-campbell.deviantart.com/art/Pencils-79071837 "Artist's Comments"]. [[DeviantArt]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AVClub&gt;{{cite web | title = Reinventing the pencil: 21 artists who changed mainstream comics (for better or worse)|publisher=[[The A.V.

;J. Scott Campbell
Artist [[J. Scott Campbell]] does his pencil with a [[lead holder]], and Sanford Turquoise [[H lead]], which he uses for its softness and darkness, and for its ability to provide a "sketchy" feel, with a minimal amount of powdery lead smearing. He uses this lead because it strikes a balance between too hard, and therefore not dark enough on the page, and too soft, and therefore prone to smearing and crumbling. Campbell avoids its closest competitor because he finds it too waxy. Campbell has also used [[HB lead]] and F lead. He maintains sharpness of the lead with a Berol Turquoise sharpener, changing them every four to six months, which he finds is the duration of their grinding ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Campbell, J. Scott|title=Pencils|url=http://j-scott-campbell.deviantart.com/art/Pencils-79071837|publisher=DeviantArt|accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell uses a combination of Magic Rub erasers, eraser sticks, and since he began to ink his work digitally, a Sakura [[electric eraser]]. He often sharpens the eraser to a cornered edge in order to render fine detailed work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Campbell, J. Scot|title=Drawing Supplies Erasers|url=http://j-scott-campbell.deviantart.com/art/Drawing-Supplies-Erasers-79071662|publisher=DeviantArt|accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Travis Charest
Artist [[Travis Charest]] uses mainly 2H lead to avoid smearing, and sometimes [[HB lead]]. He previously illustrated on regular illustration board provided by publishers, though he disliked the [[non-photo blue]] lines printed on them. By 2000, he switched to Crescent board for all his work, because it does not warp when wet, produces sharper illustrations, and are more suitable for framing because they lack the non-photo blue lines.&lt;ref name=Materials&gt;[[Charest, Travis|Travis Charest]]. [http://travischarestgallery.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=faq#materials FAQ: "What materials do I use?"] The Official Unofficial Travis Charest Gallery. December 1, 2000. Accessed August 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Charest usually prefers not to employ preliminary sketching practices, such as layouts, thumbnails or [[lightbox]]ing, in part due to impatience, and in part because he enjoys the serendipitous nature in which artwork develops when produced with greater spontaneity.&lt;ref&gt;Charest, Travis. [http://travischarestgallery.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=faq#techniques FAQ: "Working techniques"]. The Official Unofficial Travis Charest Gallery. December 1, 2000; Accessed August 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He also prefers to use reference only when rendering objects that require a degree of real-life accuracy, such as guns, vehicles or characters of licensed properties that must resemble actors with whom they are closely identified, as when he illustrated the cover to ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation: Embrace the Wolf]]'' in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Charest, Travis.

Accessed August 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

;Adam Hughes
The penciling process that artist [[Adam Hughes]] employs for his cover work is the same he uses when doing sketches for fans at conventions, with the main difference being that he does cover work in his sketchbook, before transferring the drawing to virgin art board with a lightbox,&lt;ref name=YouTubePart2&gt;Coulson, Steve. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAO3sUyg-Bw&amp;feature=related "Adam Hughes - Anatomy of a sketch, Pt2 - The Process"]. [[YouTube]]. May 15, 2006. Accessed September 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; whereas he does convention drawings on 11 x 14 Strathmore bristol, as he prefers penciling on the rougher, [[vellum]] surface rather than smooth paper, preferring smoother paper only for brush inking.&lt;ref name=YouTubePart3&gt;Coulson, Steve. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrzZffdJD_k&amp;feature=related "Adam Hughes - Anatomy of a sketch, Pt3 - The Tools"]. YouTube. May 15, 2006; Accessed September 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He does preliminary undersketches with a [[lead holder]],&lt;ref name=YouTubePart1&gt;Coulson, Steve. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvaG1EZ9shM&amp;feature=related "Adam Hughes - Anatomy of a sketch, Pt1 - The Idea"]. YouTube. May 15, 2006. Accessed September 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; because he feels regular pencils get worn down to the nub too quickly. As he explained during a sketch demonstration at a comic book convention, during this process he uses a Sanford Turquoise [[4B lead]], a soft lead, though when working at home in Atlanta, where the humid weather tends to dampen the paper, he sometimes uses a [[B lead]] or [[2B lead]], which acts like a 4B in that environment.&lt;ref name=YouTubePart3/&gt; However, his website explains that he uses 6B lead, with some variation. For pieces rendered entirely in pencil, he employs a variety of pencil leads of varying degrees of hardness.&lt;ref name=OfficialFAQ&gt;[http://www.justsayah.com/faq/ "FAQ"]. Just Say AH! Retrieved November 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; After darkening in the construction lines that he wishes to keep, he erases the lighter ones with a [[kneaded eraser]] before rendering greater detail.&lt;ref name=YouTubePart1/&gt; For more detailed erasures, he uses a pencil-shaped [[white eraser]], and to erase large areas, he uses a larger, hand-held white eraser, the Staedtler Mars plastic, which he calls a "thermonuclear eraser", because it "takes care of everything".&lt;ref name=YouTubePart3/&gt;

;Joe Quesada
Artist and former Marvel Comics editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]] begins with sketches much smaller than the actual size at which he will render the final drawing. He employs a Cintiq [[drawing tablet]] when he desires to do a "tighter" digital layout of an illustration. When sketching figures, he will sometimes use photographic reference, and incorporate the photos directly into his sketches during the process of finalizing a layout. Once he makes a final decision on a layout, he will then print it out at full size, and use a light box to pencil it, sometimes altering elements in the design such as lighting or other details.&lt;ref&gt;[[Quesada, Joe]]. [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=21572 "The Making of the Cover for 'Amazing Spider-Man' #593"]. Comic Book Resources. June 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=doodle "Cup O' Doodles" Archives], Comic Book Resources, accessed January 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Bryan Hitch
Artist [[Bryan Hitch]] begins with multiple rough sketches employing different camera angles on paper with a blue pencil, which traditionally does not photocopy or scan, and then select the desired elements from the rough sketch with a graphite pencil. After picking the initial shapes, he will further emphasize his selections with a red marker pen and other colored pens, continuing to attempt different variations. He will then, depending on how late in the day it is, either redraw the illustration on a sheet of layout paper or use his lightbox to tighten and clean up the drawing, emphasizing that the lightbox should not be a mere exercise in tracing, but an opportunity to refine or change elements in the drawing to make it "clean" enough to be inked. When Hitch transfers the drawing to the final art board, he does initial layouts with a 2H pencil, which he feels provides the necessary accuracy and detail, and uses an erasable blue pencil to mark panel frames and [[vanishing point]]s, which he introduces after the rough stage. He chooses not to put too much time or polish into this stage, preferring to work quickly, lightly and instinctively. He uses a mechanical pencil with 0.9mm 2H lead at this stage for fine outlines and detail work, and a traditional pencil for more organic work, including softer lines, shading large areas and creating more fluid motion. The "best tool of all", according to him, is a traditional pencil cut with a [[craft knife]], which he says can produce a variety of marks, and be used for detail, shading and general sketching. Hitch believes the best results combine both the mechanical and the knife-sharpened traditional pencil. Hitch is particular about his studio workspace, which does not contain a TV or sofa, stating that such things belong in the lounge for relaxation. Despite using a professional drawing board, he emphasizes that any inexpensive board large enough to hold the paper is sufficient, as he himself mostly uses a piece of roughly cut [[chip-board]] leaning on the edge of his desk. He uses an [[Apple iMac]] desktop computer, [[flatbed scanner]] and [[Photoshop]] to modify his artwork digitally.&lt;ref name=BHUCStudio&gt;[[Hitch, Bryan]]. ''Bryan Hitch's Ultimate Comics Studio'', Impact Books, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

;Simone Bianchi
In contrast to Hitch's work environment, artist [[Simone Bianchi (artist)|Simone Bianchi]] says that he cannot work unless he is listening to music, and has an extensive music collection in his studio, and stereo speakers placed above his drawing board. Bianchi uses extensive photo reference and a lightbox to give his artwork a realistic look. He uses a wooden drawing board that he used to draw on flat, but angled it due to back pain that he began having in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Weiland, Jonah (January 10, 2007). [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=9019 "Studio Tours: Artist Simone Bianchi"]. Comic Book Resources.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Marc Silvestri
Another artist who listens to music while working is [[Marc Silvestri]], who says that he listens to [[down-tempo chill music]] while working, in contrast to the [[alternative rock]] he listens to at other times.&lt;ref name=ThirdDegree&gt;"The Third Degree: Marc Silvestri". ''Point of Impact''. Image Comics. October 2012. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Erik Larsen
On the Biography &amp; Bibliography page of his website, [[Erik Larsen]] explains that he uses a Staedtler Mars Lumograph 100 2H pencil, and a Staedtler Mars Plastic Eraser.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Erik. [http://www.savagedragon.com/eriklarsen.htm "Erik Larsen - Biography &amp; Bibliography"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526004822/http://www.savagedragon.com/eriklarsen.htm |date=2011-05-26 }}. [[Savage Dragon]].com. Retrieved February 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the site's Frequently Asked Questions page, he states that he uses a standard Dixon Ticonderoga #2 pencil with HB lead, explaining, "It's mushy as all hell but it doesn't slow me down like a harder pencil would."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savagedragon.com/faq.htm|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=SavageDragon.com|author=Larsen, Erik|accessdate=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Amanda Conner
While reading each page of a script, artist [[Amanda Conner]] does tiny thumbnail sketches with stick figures corresponding to the story indicated on each page, in order to help her design the page's layout. She then does tighter, more elaborate sketches, though still fairly small compared with the finished artwork,&lt;ref name=CreatingComics&gt;Salavetz, Judith; Drate, Spencer.

She then uses "very tight pencils" to [[light-box]] it onto [[Bristol board]], if she intends to have it inked by her husband and collaborator, Jimmy Palmiotti, but will do the pencils "lighter and looser" if she intends to ink it herself, as she already knows how she wants the artwork rendered.&lt;ref name=CreatingComics/&gt; Conner has created her own paper stock and blue line format on her drawing paper, because, she explains, she likes having those configurations pre-printed on the page, and feels that "sometimes the rough is too toothy and the smooth is too slick." The stock she uses is the 10" x 15" Strathmore 500 series, but she also orders a custom 8" x 12" stock because she sometimes finds those dimensions more comfortable and easier to work on more quickly. She also finds the Strathmore 300 series "pretty good" likes its nice texture and greater affordability, but says that must occasionally content with getting a "bleedy batch". Conner uses mechanical pencils with .03 lead because she found it easier to use than regular pencils that require her to stop and sharpen them frequently.&lt;ref name=CreatorOwnedHeroes/&gt;

;Gene Ha
Once artist [[Gene Ha]] obtains a script, he makes "tiny" thumbnail sketches of each page, and then makes layout sketches on shrunked copies of comic art board, two per page. It is at this stage that he works out the light/dark balance of the page. Though he says about 90% of his artwork are done without photo reference, he will sometimes photograph his friends pose as the central characters, or use a full length mirror to draw himself. He renders minor characters from his imagination. Irrespective of how much sunlight he has on a given day, he prefers to use a 500W incandescent photo lamp, though he believes a 500W halogen lamp is also adequate. He prefers to use a [[lead holder]] with [[H lead]] for sketching, and [[2B lead]] for shading, which he sharpens with a rotary lead pointer, believing that such leads can be sharpened better than a traditional pencil. He blows up a scan of each page layout to 8.5" x 11", and draws "tight" pencils on top of these, which are then scanned and printed on 11" x 17" [[inkjet paper]] in faint [[Non-photo blue|blue line]]. He prefers [[Xerox]] paper because he feels that the surface of marker paper tends to get smudgy or oily. When importing art to modify in his computer, he uses [[Photoshop]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geneha.com/faq.htm "Questions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215112348/http://www.geneha.com/faq.htm |date=2013-12-15 }}.

;Jason Shiga
Artist [[Jason Shiga]] penciled his 2011 graphic novel ''Empire State: A Love Story (Or Not)'' with a yellow [[No. 2 pencil]] on copy paper, before transferring it with brushed ink via a lightbox.&lt;ref name=EmpireState&gt;Shiga, Jason.

;Jonathan Luna
Artist Jonathan Luna uses 14 x 17 Strathmore Bristol board, which he cuts into 11 x 17 pieces on which to draw. He draws using a 2H pencil, and after inking his pencils with a [[Micron pen]], he edits his line work on a graphics tablet.&lt;ref name=YouTube&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3Hm-0TbvxM Interview with the Luna Brothers at] [[Midtown Comics]]; [[YouTube]]; May 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

;Marcio Takara
Artist [[Marcio Takara]] begins his pages with 7" x 5" ink thumbnail sketches with which he shows his overall ideas to his editor. When he begins the actual pencils, he keeps them "loose", because he will eventually ink over them himself, and does not require greater specificity. The penciling stage is the fastest stage for Takara, who does all of his pencil work with an [[HB pencil|HB 0.5]] mechanical pencil, completing two or three penciled pages a day, sometimes even inking all three by the end of the day.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Incredibles: Family Matters]]'' trade paperback. (July 2009) [[BOOM! Studios]].&lt;/ref&gt;

;Chuck Austen
Writer/artist [[Chuck Austen]] did his work on ''[[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]'' entirely on a computer. He prefers uses mostly Macintoshes, but also uses [[IBM PC compatible|PC]]s. When using a Mac, he uses ''[[Ray Dream Studio]]'', and when using a PC, usings ''[[3D Studio Max]]''. These allow him to take three-dimensional models and break them down into simplified two-tone line forms. He purchases the models from catalogues, or uses ones that he built for ''Strips'' using in ''Hash'' or ''[[Animation:Master]]''. After importing the models into ''Studio'' or ''Max'', he arranges the angles and other aspects of the scene before rendering them, such as placement of background objects or modifying gestures, while the computer corrects elements such as [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], [[foreshortening]], proportions, etc. After the files are rendered to Austen's satisfaction, he assembles them into page form using [[Photoshop]], completing details that the modeling programs cannot perfect, such as facial expressions, hair, filling in blacks, rendering clothes and wrinkles, etc. To finish the art, he will either print out the "pencils" directly onto Bristol board and finalize them with an HB Tombow pencil and ink them with a #2 nib, or will apply the finishes in Photoshop.&lt;ref name=CBRWarMachine&gt;Giles, Keith (September 6, 2011).

;Scott McCloud
[[Scott McCloud]] also does his work almost entirely on a [[computer tablet]]. Although he sketches his layouts in pencil, the remainder of his work is done digitally, explaining in his 2006 book ''[[Making Comics]]'' that he had not used traditional materials like Bristol board, pens or brushes in years. After sketching layouts, which he says are "pretty tight", and include the full script, he scans them into an 18-inch tablet/monitor to use them as a guide for lettering them in [[Adobe Illustrator]]. After completing the lettering, he exports the files to Photoshop, where he fully renders the art at a resolution of 1,200 [[Dots per inch|dpi]], creating between five and fifty layers of finished art before flattening it into a single black and white [[bitmap]], plus a [[greyscale]] page, if needed.&lt;ref&gt;McCloud, Scott (2006), ''Making Comics''. [[William Morrow Paperbacks]]. pp 196-197&lt;/ref&gt;

;Fiona Staples
Another artist who does her work almost entirely digitally is [[Fiona Staples]], who switched to that process several years prior to beginning her work on ''[[Saga (comic book)|Saga]]'', though her process for that series is different from previous ones, for which she characterizes it as "one intense, ongoing experiment." She begins with thumbnails, roughly drawn on printed paper templates. During this stage Staples does not use reference, but does so later in the inking stage. During the thumbnail stage, she gives copious thought to the layouts and staging, making it, in her words, the most important part of the process. After scanning the thumbnails, she enlarges them and uses them as rudimentary pencils, and "inks" over them in [[Manga Studio]], and later colors the art in Photoshop. One of the advantages Staples sees in working digitally is the ability to dispense with tight pencils in favor of making corrections in an ad hoc manner, as she finds penciling in great detail and drawing such art a second time in ink to be boring.&lt;ref name="Saga#8"&gt;{{cite comic|title=[[Saga (comic book)|Saga]]|issue=8|story=Fiona's Process|publisher=Image Comics|writer=Staples, Fiona|artist=Staples, Fiona|date=December 2012|page=24-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Chris Samnee
Artist [[Chris Samnee]] Samnee uses 300 series two-ply Strathmore Bristol board. He does not use non-photo blue pencils or any other equipment purchased at specialty stores for preliminary sketching, but uses .9&amp;nbsp;mm mechanical pencils that he purchases from [[Target Corporation|Target]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comic-con.org/toucan/chris-samnee-devil-details-part-2 "Chris Samnee: The Devil is in the Details, Part 2"]. Toucan: The Official Blog. June 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes his pencils as "just awful", and inks them himself, as he cannot envision giving them to someone else to ink.&lt;ref name=Toucan&gt;[http://www.comic-con.org/toucan/chris-samnee-devil-details-part-1 "Chris Samnee: The Devil is in the Details, Part 1"]. Toucan Blog. May 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==
Some artists use a '''loose pencilling''' approach, in which the penciller does not take much care to reduce the vagaries of the pencil art, leaving it to the inker to interpret the penciller's intent. In those cases, the penciller is usually credited with "'''breakdowns'''" or "'''layouts'''" and the inker is credited as the "embellisher" or "finisher".&lt;ref&gt;"Bullpen Bulletins", ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #52 (Marvel Comics, June 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Other pencillers prefer to create detailed pages, where every nuance that they expect to see in the inked art is indicated in pencil. This is known as '''tight pencilling'''.

== Workflow ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
A comic book penciller usually works closely with the comic book's [[editing|editor]], who commissions a script from the [[writer]] and sends it to the penciller.

Comic book scripts can take a variety of forms. Some writers, such as [[Alan Moore]], produce complete, elaborate, and lengthy outlines of each page. Others send the artist only a plot outline consisting of no more than a short overview of key scenes with little or no dialogue. [[Stan Lee]], was known to prefer this latter form, and thus it came to be known as the [[Marvel Method]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Evanier|Evanier, Mark]]. ''Kirby: King of Comics'' ([[Harry N. Abrams]], New York, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a writer or another artist (such as an [[art director]]) will include basic layouts, called "[[script breakdown|breakdown]]s," to assist the penciller in scene composition. If no breakdowns are included, then it falls to the penciller to determine the layout of each page, including the number of panels, their shapes and their positions. Even when these visual details are indicated by a script, a penciller may feel when drawing the scene that there is a different way of composing the scene, and may disregard the script, usually following consultation with the editor and/or writer.

'''''Plique-à-jour''''' (French for "letting in daylight") is a [[vitreous enamel]]ling technique where the enamel is applied in cells, similar to [[cloisonné]], but with no backing in the final product, so light can shine through the transparent or translucent enamel. It is in effect a miniature version of [[stained-glass]] and is considered very challenging technically:  high time consumption (up to 4 months per item), with a high failure rate.  The technique is similar to that of [[cloisonné]], but using a temporary backing that after firing is dissolved by acid or rubbed away.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 38-40; Ostoia, 78; [http://www.glass-on-metal.com/pastart/pliqueajour.htm ''Plique à Jour - Yesterdays Technique Today''], Bill Helwig, June 1992, Glass on Metal magazine&lt;/ref&gt; A different technique relies solely on [[surface tension]], for smaller areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SX29QC99mS8C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=Byzantine+plique-%C3%A0-jour+enamel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KEjVTfDiI8vAtAaF1uSKDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Art of Fine Enameling''], Karen L. Cohen, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan the technique is known as '''shotai-jippo''' (shotai shippo), and is found from the 19th century on.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O119856/bowl/ Japanese bowl] in the V&amp;A&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The technique was developed in the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 6th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phokani.ge/pdf/enamel_eng.pdf Georgian Art Studio Phokani]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.langantiques.com/pages/decorative_periods/art-nouveau-period Lang Antiques]&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of Byzantine plique-à-jour survived in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n [[icon]]s. The technique of plique-à-jour was adopted by [[Kievan Russia]] (strong trading partner of [[Constantinople]]) with other enamel techniques. Despite its complexity plique-à-jour tableware (especially "[[kovsh]]" bowls) was used by its aristocracy. Russian masters significantly developed plique-à-jour technique: in addition to cells cut in precious metal they worked with cells made of silver wire. Unfortunately the plique-à-jour technique of [[Kievan Russia]] was lost after the crushing [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasion]] in the 13th century. Some surviving examples are exhibited in the Historical Museum in Moscow.

Western Europe adopted the plique-à-jour technique (cells cut in metal) of Byzantium.  The term 'smalta clara' ("clear enamel"), probably meaning ''plique à jour'' appears in 1295 in the inventory of [[Pope Boniface VIII]]&lt;ref&gt;Labarte, Histoire des arts industriels, iii, Paris, 1865, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; and the French term itself appears in inventories from the 14th century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pgYqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=plique-%C3%A0-jour&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZR_VTbilGY_4sgaIk42jDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=plique-%C3%A0-jour&amp;f=false ''Recherches sur la peinture en émail dans l'antiquité et au moyen âge''], Jules Labarte, 1856.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benvenuto Cellini]] (1500–1571) gives a full description of the process in his Treatises of Benvenuto Cellini on Gold-smithing and Sculpture of 1568. Pre-19th century pieces are extremely rare because of their "extreme fragility ... which increases greatly with their size", and the difficulty of the technique.  Survivals "are almost exclusively small ornamental pieces". The outstanding early examples that survive are "the decorative insets in the early fifteenth-century [[Mérode Cup]] (Burgundian cup) at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London, a Swiss early sixteenth-century plique-a-jour enamel plaque representing the family of the Virgin Mary in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/medieval_art/plaque_with_the_virgin_and_child//objectview.aspx?OID=170008038&amp;collID=17&amp;dd1=17 Plaque in Metropolitan]&lt;/ref&gt; and the eight pinnacle points over the front of the eleventh-century [[Saint Stephen's Crown]] in Hungary".&lt;ref&gt;Ostoia, 78&lt;/ref&gt;   The technique was lost in both Western and Eastern Europe.

The technique was revived in the late 19th century movement of revivalist jewellery, and became especially popular in Russia and Scandinavia. Works by [[Pavel Ovchinikov]], [[Ivan Khlebnikov]], and some masters working for [[Faberge]] are real masterpieces of plique-à-jour. Russian masters predominately worked with tableware.  Norwegian jewellers included David Andersen and J. Tostrup in Oslo,&lt;ref&gt;Marit Guinness Aschan and Rika Smith McNally. "Enamel." Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. 28 July 2010 [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T026009 Subscription required].&lt;/ref&gt; and Martin Hummer in Bergen.  [[Art nouveau]] artists such as [[René Lalique]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/tchan_5_04.shtm National Gallery of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; and other French and German artists predominantly used plique-à-jour in small jewellery, though the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum has a tray of 1901 by [[Eugene Feuillâtre]] (1870–1916).&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O88346/ring-tray/ Ring-tray by Eugene Feuillâtre], V&amp;A.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Currently plique-à-jour still not often used because it is challenging technically and mainly due to break in transferring of skills between generations of jewelers. Although some luxury houses ([[Tiffany &amp; Co.|Tiffany]] in jewellery, [[Bulushoff]] in jewellery and tableware) produce limited numbers of products in plique-à-jour technique.  Works in shotai shippo technique are also known from China and Iran.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Techniques==
There are four basic ways of creating plique-a-jour:

1. Filigree plique-a-jour ("Russian plique-a-jour"): This is a building up process whereby a planned design is interpreted using gold or silver wires which are worked over a metal form (i.e. bowl). Wires are twisted or engraved, e.g. have additional micro patterns. The wires are soldered together. Enamels are ground and applied to each "cell" created by the metal wirework. The piece is fired in a kiln. This process of placing and firing the enamels is repeated until all cells are completely filled. Usually it takes up to 15-20 repeats.

2. Pierced plique-a-jour ("Western plique-a-jour"): A sheet of gold or silver is pierced and sawed, cutting out a desired design. This leaves empty spaces or "cells" to fill with enamel powders (ground glass).

3. Shotai shippo ("Japanese plique-a-jour"): A layer of flux (clear enamel) is fired over a copper form. Wires are fired onto the flux (similar to cloisonné) and the resulting areas are enameled in the colors of choice. When all the enameling is finished, the copper base is etched away leaving a translucent shell of plique-a-jour.

4. Cloisonné on mica: Cells in precious metal are covered with fixed mica, which is stitched out with abrasives after enameling.

The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style of architecture]] was introduced in [[Architecture of Portugal|Portugal]] between the end of the 11th and the beginning of the 12th century. In general, Portuguese cathedrals have a heavy, fortress-like appearance, with crenellations and few decorative elements apart from portals and windows. Portuguese Romanesque cathedrals were later extensively modified, among others the [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra]], although it only had some minor changes.&lt;ref name="A Chronology of Western Architecture"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Chronology of Western Architecture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LQMvt0lE6egC|publisher = Courier Corporation|date = 2010-06-01|isbn = 9780486476483|first = Doreen|last = Yarwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronological and geographical distribution of Romanesque buildings in [[Portugal]] are intimately connected with the territorial organization emerging from the [[Reconquista]], being the fundamental reason for the differences between a locally influenced artistical phenomenon in the North of the country and a more "international" kind in buildings like [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra|Coimbra]] and [[Lisbon Cathedral|Lisbon]] Cathedrals.&lt;ref name="Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3105.pdf|title = Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|publisher = Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Romanesque architecture first developed in Minho and Douro regions (with [[Braga Cathedral]] being its reference) spreading later southwards to Coimbra. It is in the rural areas of the northwest and center regions that Romanesque buildings are more concentrated, being more dense in the margins of rivers Douro and Mondego.&lt;ref name="ARQUITECTURA ROMÂNICA E GÓTICA NO MINHO"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/35392/1/ARQUITECTURA%20ROM%C3%82NICA%20E%20G%C3%93TICA%20NO%20MINHO.pdf|title = ARQUITECTURA ROMÂNICA E GÓTICA NO MINHO|date = |accessdate = |website = Repositório da Universidade do Minho|publisher = Paula Bessa|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in areas that had been recently added to Portuguese territory, thus more open to foreign influence, places where royal and ecclesiastical sponsorship were stronger, where French monastical communities settled in and foreign artists produced their works (like [[Coimbra]] and [[Lisbon]]), that we find the most artistically complete forms of Romanesque. As it expanded it became more local, mixing with earlier regional construction techniques and solutions.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanesque building construction activity gained pace after 1095, when [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Count Henry]] took possession of the [[County of Portugal]]. Count Henry came with noblemen and Benedictine monks from the [[Cluny Abbey|Abbey of Cluny]], which was headed by Henry's brother, [[Hugh of Cluny|Hugh]]. The Benedictines and other religious orders ended up giving great impulse to Romanesque architecture in Portugal during the whole 12th century.
Examples of those rural monastical and parish churches, most of them built in the 9th and 10th centuries with late High Middle Ages artistical features and before the expansion of Romanesque architecture, are the [[Monastery of Rates]], one of the best iconographical buildings of this style in Portugal, the churches of Paço de Sousa Monastery, [[Igreja de Santa Maria de Airães|Santa Maria de Airães]] and the [[Igreja de São Pedro de Ferreira|Monastery of São Pedro de Ferreira]], among others.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their communities first followed the Benedictine rule but were later deeply influenced by the monastical reforms in the 11th century, mainly the [[Cluniac Reforms|Cluniac]], reflected in the adoption of newly Romanesque architectural features, creating some very regional and rich decorative and architectural solutions.&lt;ref name="Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3105.pdf|title = Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|publisher = Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Mozarabic communities maintained for the practice of their religious rites some of the Visigothic churches predating the Islamic occupation, the extent of this Visigothic artistical heritage is hard to pinpoint,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://books.google.pt/books?id=WdXQnaME1gMC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=The+art+of+Medieval+Portugal&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Mozarabic%20architecture&amp;f=false|title = Art of the frontier: Mozarabic Monasticism|date = |accessdate = |website = The Art of Medieval Spain, A.D. 500-1200|publisher = The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; as most monuments from the previous period have been lost. Nevertheless, those buildings that did survive seem to hold on tenaciously to traditions of [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic]] architecture with few, if any, [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] features. All this includes them in the ample concept of [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque architecture]]. Besides this possible Visigothic connection, Mozarabic architecture in Portugal also came in contact with [[Asturian architecture|Asturian art]], identified with the artistic creations that were being produced during the 9th century specifically in the territories that comprised the [[Kingdom of Asturias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Novos elementos sobre a arte moçárabe em território português|url = https://www.academia.edu/462174/Novos_elementos_sobre_a_arte_mo%25C3%25A7%25C3%25A1rabe_em_territ%25C3%25B3rio_portugu%25C3%25AAs|website = www.academia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this artistic activity, in general (and architecture specifically) was not limited to this area or this century, it encompassed the whole northern peninsula and continued during the next century.

[[Image:PM 33274 P Lourosa.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Central nave of the Church of São Pedro de Lourosa (Coimbra)]]

The most exceptional example of Mozarabic architecture in [[Portugal]] is the Church of São Pedro de Lourosa,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DGPC {{!}} Pesquisa Geral|url = http://www.patrimoniocultural.pt/pt/patrimonio/patrimonio-imovel/pesquisa-do-patrimonio/classificado-ou-em-vias-de-classificacao/geral/view/70268/|website = www.patrimoniocultural.pt|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Igreja de São Pedro de Lourosa faz 1100 anos: é uma das mais antigas de Portugal e a «única» do período moçárabe {{!}} Secretariado Nacional da Pastoral da Cultura|url = http://www.snpcultura.org/igreja_sao_pedro_lourosa_faz_1100_anos.html|website = www.snpcultura.org|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Coimbra]]. There is no doubt that this rural church was founded sometime around 912 AD (950 by the [[Spanish era|Era of Caesar]], corresponds to 912 by [[Anno Domini|Christian Era]]) according to an authentic inscription found in one of the transept arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.snpcultura.org/fotografias/igreja_sao_pedro_lourosa/3.jpg|title = Inscription found in São Pedro de Lourosa church that points to the date of its construction.|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a number of Asturian references to the church's engravings, the influences of the architectural models favoured by the Mozarabs are clearly visible in the modulation of the masonry and mainly in the decorative elements of the cornices (use of the [[Alfiz]]) and the design of [[horseshoe arch]]es, typical of Mozarabic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A igreja de São Pedro de Lourosa - Oliveira do Hospital|url = https://saopedrodelourosa.no.sapo.pt/mocarabeartes.htm|website = saopedrodelourosa.no.sapo.pt|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its basilican type structure comprises a small transept separating the chancel from the main body of the building (called a [[Narthex]]), and a row of three surmounted arches supported by columns separating the central nave from the side aisles. During restoration works carried out in the mid-20th century, various architectural features were found that would have belonged to an earlier Visigothic church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = In the Lands of the Enchanted Moorish Maiden: Islamic Art in Portugal (Islamic Art in the Mediterranean)|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TDzdBAAAQBAJ|publisher = Museum With No Frontiers, MWNF (Museum Ohne Grenzen)|date = 2013-06-01|isbn = 9783902782137|first = Cláudio|last = Torres|first2 = Santiago|last2 = Macias|first3 = Susana|last3 = Gómez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise and development of Romanesque in Portugal (11th to 13th century)==
[[Image:Mosteiro_de_Santa_Cruz%2C_fachada.jpg|thumb|right|'''Monastery of Santa Cruz''' (Coimbra), its original Romanesque facade was later redecorated with [[Manueline]] style during the 16th century]]

In Portugal, the Romanesque architecture comes in late 11th century within a wider phenomenon of European cultural and religious spreading to the Iberian Peninsula, influenced by the [[Cluniac Reforms|Cluniac]] monastical reforms and the arrival of the Orders of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] (after 1086), [[Cistercians|Cister]] (or Citeaux) (1144), [[Order of Saint Augustine|St. Augustine]] (after 1131) and the Military-Religious Orders of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] (1121) and the [[Knights Templar]] (1126).&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanesque architecture, through its prestige, relates with the rise and assertion of Portuguese independence.

Developing itself later than witnessed in the rest of Europe, in Portugal it only gained real significance after the second quarter of the 12th century, although previous buildings of the same style already existed. Various factors contribute to this aspect, mainly the unstable environment experienced in the Iberian Peninsula at the time due to the [[Reconquista]]&lt;ref name="Portuguese Romanesque architecture, the foundation of Portugal as a Kingdom and its artistic convergence"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Portuguese Romanesque architecture, the foundation of Portugal as a Kingdom and its artistic convergence|url = https://www.academia.edu/10344015/Portuguese_Romanesque_architecture_the_foundation_of_Portugal_as_a_Kingdom_and_its_artistic_convergence|website = www.academia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the consequent political reorganisation of peninsular geography. In fact, one of the most significant aspects of Romanesque architecture in the Peninsula, but particularly in Portugal, is the noticeable connotation that we find between its spreading and land organisation and occupation.&lt;ref name="Portuguese Romanesque architecture, the foundation of Portugal as a Kingdom and its artistic convergence"/&gt; The arrival in Portugal of the religious orders mentioned above must be understood in the general context of the Reconquista. In fact, those monastical institutions received immense privileges from the Portuguese monarchs and nobility, contributing to the security of the territory, but above all, to its social organization.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"/&gt; This Reconquista took place from North to South, resulting in the same spread of Romanesque architecture with a decreasing density to the South. Almost no Romanesque artifacts survive in Southern Portugal.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;José Custódio Vieira da Silva, Portugal §2: Architecture; Oxford Art online&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Igreja_de_Rates.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Main façade of [[Monastery of Rates]] old church, a Cluniac monastic building.]]

The first Romanesque churches in the North were simple constructions, consisting of a nave with a timber roof and a rectangular apse. Examples can be found at the [[Igreja de São Cristóvão de Rio Mau]], at the [[Igreja de Santa Eulália do Mosteiro de Arnoso]] and at the [[Church of Fontarcada]] (with already a semicircular apse at the east end).&lt;ref name="Oxford" /&gt;

Expansion of the Romanesque style coincided with the reign of [[Afonso I of Portugal|D.Afonso Henriques]] (1139–1185), a monarch with [[House of Burgundy|Burgundian]] background being the son of [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Count Henry]] and great grandson of [[Robert II of France|Robert II]], King of France.&lt;ref name="Mattoso"&gt;{{Cite book|author = José Mattoso |title= D. Afonso Henriques |language=pt |edition=second |location=Lisbon |publisher=Temas e Debates |date=2014 |isbn=978-972-759-911-0 |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his reign [[Lisbon Cathedral|Lisbon]], [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra|Coimbra]], [[Porto Cathedral|Porto]] and [[Viseu Cathedral|Viseu]] Cathedrals were built and also the Augustinian [[Monastery of Santa Cruz (Coimbra)|Monastery of Santa Cruz]], projected to be a royal pantheon.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"/&gt; The construction began in 1131 and by 1150 the nave and its apses were already finished. Its structural shape and decorative features were a novelty in Portugal, showing that its architect was either probably French or came in contact with [[List of Romanesque buildings|French Romanesque]] architecture from [[Burgundy]] like Tournus, Cluny, Paray-le-Monial or Romainmôtier.

Being a predominantly religious architecture, Portuguese Romanesque style was deeply related with ecclesiastical rural church parishes and [[Monasticism|monastic]] monasteries founded or rebuilt in the 12th and 13th centuries, with bishops, by royal mandate, their biggest sponsors.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"/&gt;

==Romanesque cathedrals (Braga, Porto, Viseu, Coimbra and Lisbon)==
===Braga Cathedral===
The [[Braga Cathedral|Cathedral of Braga]] was rebuilt in the 1070s by Bishop Pedro and consecrated in 1089, although only the apse was finished at the time. He wished to create a pilgrimage church, with a three aisled nave, an ambulatory and a large transept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://repositorio.ucp.pt/bitstream/10400.14/4966/1/LS_S1_01_AvelinoJCosta.pdf|title = Restoration of Braga Cathedral in 1070 AD|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Universidade Católica Portuguesa|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Works increased during the tenure of [[Paio Mendes|D.Paio Mendes]] as archbishop (1118–37), after King D.Afonso Henriques granted a [[Foral|foral chart]] to the city as well as generous donations for its construction. It was then resumed and lasted until the middle of the 13th century. The original 12th-century building was built in the Burgundian Romanesque style of the monastery church of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] and influenced many other churches and monasteries in Portugal in that period. In later times the cathedral was greatly modified, so that today it is a mix of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Manueline]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Monumentos|url = http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=1050|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

[[Image:Sé_de_Braga_001.jpg|thumb|left|Main façade of '''Braga Cathedral'''. The entrance gallery (galilee) with three arches is gothic (end of the 15th century), but the towers and upper storeys are early baroque (17th century).]]

The original Romanesque '''Western façade''' of the Cathedral has been totally suppressed, except for some [[archivolt]]s and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] of the main portal, heavily decorated with animal and human sculptured reliefs. The figures on one archivolt, with hens, foxes and a minstrel, may be telling a moralistic song like the ones from [[Roman de Renart]], of French tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MEDIEVALISTA|url = http://www2.fcsh.unl.pt/iem/medievalista/MEDIEVALISTA1/medievalista-iconografia.htm|website = www2.fcsh.unl.pt|accessdate = 2015-11-23|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131107001353/http://www2.fcsh.unl.pt/iem/medievalista/MEDIEVALISTA1/medievalista-iconografia.htm|archivedate = 2013-11-07|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside it has three [[aisle]]s covered by a wooden roof, a transept and five Eastern chapels in the apse. On the north wall outside of the cathedral there is the small '''Chapel of São Geraldo''', in memory of [[Gerald of Braga|Geraldo of Moissac]], Archbishop of Braga (1096–1108), of early Romanesque design, that may be a remnant of the late 11th-century building. This chapel was left outside of the final cathedral, perhaps due to a change of design in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Evolução Histórico - Artística - Rota das Catedrais|url = http://rotadascatedrais.com/pt/braga-evolucao-historico-artistica|website = rotadascatedrais.com|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''[[nave]]''' is essentially Romanesque thanks to a "purifying" reform in the 20th century that suppressed most later additions, although some original capitals of the columns have been lost. '''D.Afonso''', son of King [[John I of Portugal|D.João I]], is buried in a 15th-century tomb made of bronze, which can be seen in the nave of the Cathedral.

Several chapels were built adjacent to the cathedral in the Middle Ages. The '''Chapel of Kings''' (Capela dos Reis) was built around 1374 in the place where [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Count Henrique]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Tumulo_Conde_D._Henrique.JPG/1280px-Tumulo_Conde_D._Henrique.JPG|title = Tomb of Count Henry of Burgundy|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Theresa, Countess of Portugal|Countess Teresa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/D._Teresa.JPG/800px-D._Teresa.JPG|title = Tomb of D.Teresa, Countess and Queen of Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; were buried.

===Porto Cathedral===
[[Image:Se-Catedral-Exterior (4), Sé do Porto, 2004.png|thumb|right|250px|'''Porto Cathedral''', its heavy and imposing facade with thick buttresses was later embellished by a Baroque portal.]]
The [[Porto Cathedral]], located in the historical centre of the city of [[Porto]], is one of the city's oldest monuments and one of the most important Romanesque monuments in the country.
There is evidence that the city has been a bishopric seat since the [[Suevi]] domination in the 5th-6th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.pt/books?id=F-aXDCMdJR0C&amp;pg=PP61&amp;lpg=PP61&amp;dq=Bispos+do+Porto+no+per%C3%ADodo+Suevo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UCaW74yio1&amp;sig=p18fTn80iMpXenJPDRCsUH0oSSU&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjs0o_Z76nJAhXIbxQKHUdABRUQ6AEILDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Bispos%20do%20Porto%20no%20per%C3%ADodo%20Suevo&amp;f=false|title=Catálogo e historia dos bispos do Porto|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Diocese do Porto|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current building was built according to tradition around 1110 under the patronage of '''Bishop Hugo''' (1112-1136),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MEDIEVALISTA|url = http://www2.fcsh.unl.pt/iem/medievalista/MEDIEVALISTA12/melo_ribeiro1207.html|website = www2.fcsh.unl.pt|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; but apparently the church is likely to have been built in the mid-12th century, after 1147, because the "[[De expugnatione Lyxbonensi|De Expugnatione Lyxbonensi]]" appears to describe a small church that appears to match the old pre-Romanesque cathedral built in the 9th-10th centuries. As such, the building was likely built later, as the artistic evidence, that links the Romanesque of this church to the area of La Rochelle, supports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title=A Arte Românica em Portugal|last=Rosas|first=Lúcia|last2=Botelho|first2=Leonor|publisher=Fundación Santa Maria la Real|year=2010|isbn=|location=Aguilar de Campo|pages=201–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church was only completed in 1557, when the Manueline lantern tower was installed.

The cathedral is flanked by two square towers, each supported with two [[buttresses]] and crowned with a [[cupola]]. The façade lacks decoration and is rather architecturally heterogeneous. It shows a [[Baroque]] porch and a beautiful [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Rose window|wheel window]] under a [[crenellated]] arch, giving the impression of a fortified church.
The Romanesque [[nave]] is rather narrow and is covered by [[barrel vault]]ing. It is flanked by two [[aisle]]s with a lower vault. The stone roof of the central aisle is supported by [[flying buttress]]es, making the building one of the first in Portugal to use this architectonic feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.artes.ucp.pt/citar/portoxvi/pdf/relatorio/PortoVirtualSecXVI-Mem%C3%B3ria-ParteI.pdf|title = MEMÓRIA JUSTIFICATIVA PROJECTO PORTO SÉCULO XVI A Sé e a sua envolvente no Século XVI|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = José Ferrão Afonso e Maria Leonor Botelho|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This original building has suffered some alterations (minored by the archaizing restorations of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] between 1927 and 1945&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title=Arte Românica em Portugal|last=Rosas|first=Lúcia|last2=Botelho|first2=Leonor|publisher=Fundación Santa Maria la Real|year=2010|isbn=|location=Aguilar de Campo|pages=207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;) but the general aspect of the building has remained a mix of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and Gothic.

Also to be referenced the elegant [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cloister, built between the 14th and the 15th centuries during the reign of King [[John I of Portugal|D.João I]], who married English Princess [[Philippa of Lancaster]] in this cathedral in 1387.

===Viseu Cathedral===
[[Image:Sé_de_Viseu_fachada.jpg|thumb|left|290px|'''Viseu Cathedral''', its two towers are still Romanesque but the three-storey portal is Mannerist.]]
[[Viseu Cathedral]] started being built in the 12th century and is the most important historical monument of the city. It is currently a mix of architectural styles, specially from the [[Manueline]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Mannerist]] periods.

The current cathedral building started being erected in the mid-12th century, but little remains from this early Romanesque building except for some architectural details. The church was greatly enlarged in the following centuries of the Middle Ages, assuming its present configuration as a three-aisled building with three Eastern chapels. Some Gothic chapels in the [[cloisters]] also date from this period.

Built has a three-aisled nave, [[transept]] and three Eastern chapels. The main façade is flanked by two towers. The outer, lateral walls of the church have a heavy, menacing appearance, typical of Portuguese medieval cathedrals, being partially decorated with [[merlon]]s.
The South (clock) tower is still of medieval origin, while the North tower had to be rebuilt in the 17th century after a storm. The storm also destroyed the Manueline façade, which was rebuilt around 1635. The three-storey façade resembles a Mannerist altarpiece and is decorated with niches harbouring statues of the [[Four Evangelists]], as well as the [[Holy Mary]] and [[Theotonius|Saint Theotonius]].

===Coimbra Cathedral===
The [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra]] (Portuguese: '''Sé Velha de Coimbra''') was built some time after the [[Battle of Ourique]] in 1139. The project of this Romanesque cathedral is attributed to Master Robert, a, possibly, French architect who was directing the building of Lisbon Cathedral at that time and visited Coimbra regularly. The works were supervised by Master Bernard, possibly also French, who was succeeded by Master Soeiro, an architect active in other churches around the Diocese of Porto.

[[Image:SeVelha1.jpg|thumb|right|310px|'''Coimbra Cathedral''', with crenellated tops and heavy buttresses giving it a castle like appearance.]]

From the outside, Coimbra's old cathedral looks like a fortress, with its high, [[Battlement|crenellated]] walls harbouring few, narrow windows. This menacing appearance is explained by the belligerent times in which it was built. There is a tower-like structure in the middle of the western façade with a portal and a similar-looking upper window. Both portal and window are heavily decorated with Romanesque motifs of [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic]] and [[Pre-Romanesque]] influences. The façade is reinforced by thick [[buttress]]es at the corners that compensate for the angle of the terrain (the cathedral was built on the slope of a hill).
The interior of the cathedral has a nave with two aisles, a small transept, and an eastern [[apse]] with three chapels. The nave is covered by barrel vaulting and the lateral aisles by [[groin vault]]s. The nave has an upper storey, a spacious [[triforium]] (arched gallery), that could accommodate more mass attendants in the tribunes if needed. All columns of the interior have decorated capitals, mainly with vegetable motifs, but also with animals and geometric patterns. The windows of the lantern-tower and the big window in the west facade are the main sources of natural light of the cathedral.

The cloister, built during the reign of [[Afonso II of Portugal|Afonso II]] (early 13th century), is a work of the transition between Romanesque and Gothic. Each of the Gothic pointed arches that face the courtyard encompass two twin round arches in Romanesque style.

===Lisbon Cathedral===
The '''Patriarchal Cathedral of St. Mary Major''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: Santa Maria Maior de Lisboa or Sé de Lisboa) or simply [[Lisbon Cathedral]] is the oldest church in the city and the see of [[Patriarchate of Lisbon|Archdiocese of Lisbon]].

[[Image:Se-cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|330px|'''Lisbon Cathedral''', severely damaged after the earthquake of 1755, it was rebuilt following the same original 12th-century plan.]]

This first building was completed between 1147 and the first decades of the 13th century in Late Romanesque style. At that time the relics of [[Vincent of Saragossa|St. Vincent of Saragossa]], patron saint of Lisbon, were brought to the cathedral from Southern Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = St. Vincent's Cathedral - About Us|url = http://www.stvincentscathedral.org/page/st_vincent_of_saragossa_deacon_first_martyr_of_spain|website = www.stvincentscathedral.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cathedral follows a Latin cross plan with three aisles, a transept and a main chapel surrounded by a Gothic [[ambulatory]]. The church is connected with a cloister on the Eastern side. The main façade of the cathedral looks like a fortress, with two towers flanking the entrance and crenellations over the walls. This menacing appearance, also seen in other Portuguese cathedrals of the time, is a relic from the Reconquista period, when the cathedral could be used as a base to attack the enemy during a siege.

From its first building period from 1147 until the first decades of the 13th century, Lisbon cathedral has preserved the West façade with a [[rose window]] (rebuilt from fragments in the 20th century), the main portal, the North lateral portal and the nave of the cathedral. The portals have interesting sculptured [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] with Romanesque motifs.
The nave is covered by [[barrel vault]]ing and has an upper, arched gallery ([[triforium]]). Light gets in through the rose windows of the West façade and transept, the narrow windows of the lateral aisles of the nave as well as the windows of the lantern tower of the transept. The general plan of the cathedral is very similar to that of the [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra|Cathedral of Coimbra]], which dates from the same period. One of the chapels of the ambulatory has an interesting Romanesque iron gate.

==Knights Templar round church (Charola/Rotunda) at Convent of Christ==
Originally a 12th-century [[Knights Templar|Templar]] stronghold, when the order was dissolved in the 14th century the Portuguese branch was turned into the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Knights of the Order of Christ]], that later supported Portugal's [[Age of Discovery|maritime discoveries]] of the 15th century. The [[Convent of Christ (Tomar)|Convent and Castle complex]] in [[Tomar]] is a historic and cultural monument which was listed in the list of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]] list in 1983.

[[Image:Tomar_Convento_0254.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The round church of the '''Knights Templar''' in Tomar was built to be a fortified chapel, serving both for praying and defense.]]

The convent was founded by the [[Knights Templar|Order of Poor Knights of the Temple]] (or Templar Knights) in 1160. Its construction continued until the final part of the 12th century with the construction of the Charola (oratory), in one of the angles of the castle, completed by the Grand Master [[Gualdim Pais]] sometime around 1180.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=4718|title = Convento de Cristo / Mosteiro de Cristo Portugal, Santarém, Tomar, União das freguesias de Tomar (São João Baptista) e Santa Maria dos Olivais|date = 2006|accessdate = |website = Lisbon, Portugal: SIPA – Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico|publisher = Mendonça, Isabel; Marques, Lina; Branco, Ricardo; Matias, Cecília|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Templar Church===
The Romanesque round church (charola, rotunda) was built in the second half of the 12th century by the Knights Templar, as a 16-side polygonal structure, with strong buttresses, round windows and a bell-tower. Inside, the round church has a central, octagonal structure, connected by arches to a surrounding gallery ([[ambulatory]]). The general shape of the church is modelled after similar round structures in [[Jerusalem]]: the [[Mosque of Omar]] and the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www2.fcsh.unl.pt/iem/medievalista/MEDIEVALISTA4/medievalista-santos.htm|title = The Templar round church of Tomar: A Romanesque masterpiece between East and West.|date = 2008|accessdate = |website = Institute of Medieval Studies - New University of Lisboa|publisher = Carlos Emanuel Santos|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] of the columns are still Romanesque (end of the 12th century) and depict vegetal and animal motifs, as well as a Daniel in the Lions' Den scene. The style of the capitals shows the influence of artists working on the [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra|Cathedral of Coimbra]], which was being built at the same time as the round church.&lt;ref name="A Charola Templária de Tomar: Jerusalém Perdida"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.uc.pt/chsc/rhsc/rhsc_11/rhsc11_39-56_cess.pdf|title = A Charola Templária de Tomar: Jerusalém Perdida|date = 2011|accessdate = |website = Universidade Nova de Lisboa, FCSH|publisher = Carlos Emanuel Sousa Santos|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interior of the round church is magnificently decorated with late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]/[[Manueline]] sculptures and paintings, added during a renovation sponsored by King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] starting in 1499. The pillars of the central octagon and the walls of the ambulatory have polychrome statues of saints and angels under exuberant Gothic canopies, while the walls and ceilings of the ambulatory are painted with Gothic patterns and panels depicting the life of Christ. The paintings are attributed to the workshop of the court painter of Manuel I, the Portuguese [[Jorge Afonso]], while the sculptured decoration is attributed to Flemish sculptor Olivier of Gand and the Spaniard Hernán Muñoz.&lt;ref name="A Charola Templária de Tomar: Jerusalém Perdida"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.uc.pt/chsc/rhsc/rhsc_11/rhsc11_39-56_cess.pdf|title = A Charola Templária de Tomar: Jerusalém Perdida|date = 2011|accessdate = |website = Universidade Nova de Lisboa, FCSH|publisher = Carlos Emanuel Sousa Santos|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A magnificent panel depicting the [[martyrdom]] of [[Saint Sebastian]], by Portuguese painter [[Gregório Lopes]], was painted for the Round Church and now hangs in the [[National Museum of Ancient Art]] in [[Lisbon]].

==Churches and monasteries==
[[Image:Mosteiro_de_Paco_de_Sousa.jpg|thumb|left|300px|'''Monastery of Paço de Sousa''', built in the 10th century by the Benedictine monks.]]
As previously stated, Romanesque architecture style reached Portugal by the end of the 11th century by the hand of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluniac]], [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] and [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] orders, bringing with them the [[Cluniac Reforms|monastical reforms]] that were already underway in their countries of origin. Their influence and importance on the spreading of this new art form can be asserted by the large number of [[Architecture of Portugal|churches and monasteries]], one of the kind of Romanesque buildings that survived until our days.&lt;ref name="Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3105.pdf|title = Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|publisher = Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of this new style coincides with the advance of the [[Reconquista]] to the south and the development of recent Portuguese independence and its territorial changes, reflecting this war paradigm and the need for defense profoundly engraved in the specific kind of Romanesque art we can find in Portugal: thick and menacing crenelated walls, towers, use of [[battlement]]s, [[merlon]]s, [[Embrasure|narrow slits]] and decorative austerity, like the church of '''Travanca Monastery''' with its heavy tower, the '''Monastery of Cete''', the [[Igreja de Santa Maria de Airães|Church of Airães]], [[Igreja de São Martinho de Mouros|São Martinho de Mouros]], '''Paço de Sousa Monastery''' and the [[Monastery of Rates]], one of the most artistically diverse. Almost every religious building has a fortress-like design because in the absence of castles, churches were always considered the best fortresses.&lt;ref name="Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3105.pdf|title = Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|publisher = Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SMMouros_01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Igreja de São Martinho de Mouros|Church of São Martinho de Mouros]] with its heavy and fortified structure.]]

Therefore, it is not surprising that monastical buildings comprise most of the Romanesque kind, specially in the northern areas of [[Entre-Douro-e-Minho Province|Entre-Douro-e-Minho]], [[Tâmega Subregion|Tâmega]] and Sousa valleys and along the [[Douro]] river margins. With a significant rural population dispersed within these regions and organized in [[Foral|villages]] or [[concelho]]s we also find a significant number of parish churches, like [[Igreja de São Gens de Boelhe|São Gens de Boelhe]], [[Igreja de São Vicente de Sousa|São Vicente de Sousa]], [[Igreja de São Pedro de Ferreira|São Pedro de Ferreira]] or '''Santa Maria de Cárquere''' Being very simple and small constructions, it is astonishing how each of them have such an [[Iconography|iconographic]] variety of decorative features, being another unique "indigenous" characteristic of Portuguese Romanesque.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portuguese Romanesque churches have a longitudinal structure, following the basilical plan common throughout Europe: three [[aisle]]s, [[transept]] and [[apse]] with two apsidoles, either semi-circular or square shaped, or just with one single aisle and apse.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; With semi-circular apse and apsidoles we have the churches of Ganfei, Rates, Pombeiro, São Tiago of Coimbra and Castro de Avelãs. The churches of [[Igreja de Santa Eulália do Mosteiro de Arnoso|São Cristóvão de Rio Mau]] and [[Igreja de Santa Eulália do Mosteiro de Arnoso|Santa Eulália de Arnoso]], among others, present a square-shape apse and apsidoles.

===Interiors===
[[Image:Sao_Pedro_de_Rates_Church2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Interior of the church of [[Monastery of Rates]] seen towards the main chapel, with its wooden roof and pointed arches.]]

Most Romanesque monasteries, parish churches and abbey churches in Portugal are aisless halls with a projecting [[apse]] at the chancel end, or sometimes, a projecting rectangular chancel with a chancel arch that might be decorated with mouldings. More ambitious churches have [[aisle]]s separated from the nave by arcades. The apse is lower or at the same height of the nave. Monasteries are usually larger with 3 aisles supported by decorated [[column]]s and piers. The walls are of massive thickness with few and comparatively small openings and almost entirely made out of granite stones.&lt;ref name="Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3105.pdf|title = Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|publisher = Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arcade (architecture)|Arcades]] can occur in storeys or stages. While the arcade of a [[cloister]] is typically of a single stage, the arcade that divides the nave and aisles in a church is typically of two stages, with a third stage of window openings known as the [[clerestory]] rising above them. Arcading on a large scale generally fulfils a structural purpose, but it is also used, generally on a smaller scale, as a decorative feature, both internally and externally where it is frequently "blind arcading" with only a wall or a narrow passage behind it.&lt;ref name="Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3105.pdf|title = Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|publisher = Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Iglesia_de_Sanfins_de_Friestas_(3424487664).jpg|thumb|left|280px|Interior of the church of [[Igreja de São Pedro de Ferreira|São Pedro de Ferreira Monastery]] with small openings and carved capitals.]]

The [[arch]]es used in Portuguese Romanesque buildings follow the basic European model and are nearly always semicircular, for openings such as doors and windows, for vaults and for arcades. Wide doorways are usually surmounted by a semi-circular arch, except where a door with a [[lintel]] is set into a large arched recess and surmounted by a semi-circular [[lunette]] with decorative carving.&lt;ref name="Art through the Ages"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art through the Ages.|last = |first = |publisher = Helen Gardner|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These doors sometimes have a carved central [[jamb]].
Narrow doors and small windows might be surmounted by a solid stone lintel. Larger openings are nearly always arched. A characteristic feature of Portuguese Romanesque architecture, both ecclesiastic and domestic, is the pairing of two arcade openings, separated by a [[Column|pillar]] or '''colonette''' and often set within a larger arch. There were some number of buildings in which '''pointed arches''' have been used extensively, apparently for stylistic reasons and it is believed that in these cases there is a direct influence of Mozarabic and/or Islamic architecture.&lt;ref name="A Chronology of Western Architecture"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Chronology of Western Architecture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LQMvt0lE6egC|publisher = Courier Corporation|date = 2010-06-01|isbn = 9780486476483|first = Doreen|last = Yarwood}}&lt;/ref&gt; At other late Romanesque churches the pointed arch was introduced as a structural device in ribbed vaulting. Its increasing application was fundamental to the development of [[Gothic architecture]].

[[Image:Iglesia_de_São_Pedro_de_Rubiães_(1861498064).jpg|thumb|right|280px|Interior of the [[Church of São Pedro de Rubiães]] seen towards the main entrance, with its wooden roof.]]

Although basically rectangular, piers can often be of highly complex form, with half-segments of large hollow-core [[column]]s on the inner surface supporting the arch, or a clustered group of smaller shafts leading into the mouldings of the arch.
Piers that occur at the intersection of two large arches, such as those under the crossing of the nave and [[transept]], are commonly [[cruciform]] in shape, each arch having its own supporting rectangular pier at right angles to the other.&lt;ref name="Portuguese Romanesque architecture, the foundation of Portugal as a Kingdom and its artistic convergence"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Portuguese Romanesque architecture, the foundation of Portugal as a Kingdom and its artistic convergence|url = https://www.academia.edu/10344015/Portuguese_Romanesque_architecture_the_foundation_of_Portugal_as_a_Kingdom_and_its_artistic_convergence|website = www.academia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Columns, colonnettes and attached shafts are also used structurally and for decoration. Arcades of columns cut from single pieces are also common in structures that do not bear massive weights of masonry, such as cloisters, where they are sometimes paired.

The majority of buildings have wooden roofs, generally of a simple truss, tie beam or king post form. In the case of trussed rafter roofs, they are sometimes lined with wooden ceilings in three sections like those that survive at the monasteries of [[Monastery of Rates|Rates]] or '''Paço de Sousa'''. Some others are completely [[Barrel vault|barrel]] vaulted or a mix between wooden roofs and a vaulted apse. In later stages [[rib vault]]ing started to be used as an experiment in main altar roofs.

===Portals===
[[Image:PortalSaoTiagoCoimbra.png|thumb|right|220px|Portal of the [[Igreja de Santiago (Coimbra)|Church of Santiago]] in Coimbra has columns decorated with detailed motifs.]]
Romanesque churches generally have a single portal centrally placed on the west front, the focus of decoration for the facade of the building, and both the largest and the smallest, had lateral entrances that were commonly used by worshippers. Doorways have a character form, with the [[Doorjamb|jambs]] having a series of receding planes, into each of which is set a circular [[Fluting (architecture)|shaft]], all surmounted by a continuous [[Abacus (architecture)|abacus]].

[[Image:TravancaPortal.png|thumb|left|230px|'''Travanca Monastery''' has a pointed arch portal, a feature that would later be developed in [[Gothic architecture]].]]

The semi-circular arch which rises from the abacus has the same serried planes and circular [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]] as the jambs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Romanesque.|last = |first = |publisher = Rolf Toman|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The arch consists typically of four planes containing three shafts, but there may be as many as twelve shafts, symbolic of the apostles.

The opening of the portal may be arched, or may be set with a lintel supporting a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], generally carved. A carved tympanum generally constitutes the major sculptural work of a Romanesque church. The subject of the carving on a major portal may be Christ in Majesty or the Last Judgement. Lateral doors may include other subjects such as the [[Nativity in art|Birth of Christ]]. The portal may be protected by a porch, from simple open porches to more elaborate structures. The religious context of the art at the time was well noticeable in the churches carvings, both inside the church as outside. They showed several episodes of the life of saints and various myths and biblical stories. Those that were sculptured specially in the tympanums, capitals and collonettes of the portals can be divided into two major themes:
* Representations of [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] motifs, such as crosses and [[Esoteric Christianity|esoteric]] symbols.
* Representations of [[Theophany|Theophanies]] or [[Christ in Majesty|"Maiestas Domini"]] (Christ in Majesty) such as [[Lamb of God|"Agnus Dei"]] (the mystical lamb trespassed by a cross) or [[Christ]] in [[Aureola|mandorla]] surrounded by prophets, angels and [[tetramorph]]s.

===Capitals===
The foliate [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] style provided the inspiration for many Romanesque capitals, and the accuracy with which they were carved depended very much on the availability of original models, being some much closer to the Classical than others.&lt;ref name="Art through the Ages"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art through the Ages.|last = |first = |publisher = Helen Gardner|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Iglesia_de_Nossa_Senhora_da_Orada_(2105927940).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Vegetalist capitals at the chapel of '''Nossa Senhora da Orada'''.]]

The Corinthian capital is essentially round at the bottom where it sits on a circular column and square at the top, where it supports the wall or arch. This form of capital was maintained in the general proportions and outline of the Romanesque capital. This was achieved most simply by cutting a rectangular cube and taking the four lower corners off at an angle so that the block was square at the top, but octagonal at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Escultura Românica: Arte e Técnica.|last = |first = |publisher = Marlene Borges Félix|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This shape lent itself to a wide variety of superficial treatments, sometimes foliate in imitation of the source, but often figurative, without forgetting that the kind of stone used for construction of Romanesque churches in Portugal was mostly granite which made the carving of intricate and sharp details much harder.

[[Image:Igreja_de_São_Tiago%2C_Coimbra._Capiteis_y_colunelos.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Vegetalist and animal intricate capital and column carvings in [[Igreja de Santiago (Coimbra)|Santiago Church]].]]

It is however in the figurative capitals that the greatest originality is shown. While some are dependent on [[Manuscript illumination|manuscripts illustrations]] of Biblical scenes and depictions of beasts and monsters, others are lively scenes of the legends of local saints, all of those with a deep religious meaning and pedagogical objective of teaching the faithful ones about virtues and sins guiding them through the right path.&lt;ref name="Rota do Românico"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rotadoromanico.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PerfilHistoriador/O_Romanico_em_Portugal.pdf|title = Rota do Românico|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important aspect of the iconography represented in capitals throughout the Portuguese Romanesque buildings are the scenes of daily life or mundane events such as musicians playing instruments, acrobats performing stunts, people dancing. Also, scenes representing the several economical activities of that period like peasants planting crops, farm animals (cows, sheep, goats, horses, etc.), as well as the social medieval hierarchy displaying knights, bishops and peasants each performing specific tasks according to their social positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www2.fcsh.unl.pt/iem/medievalista/MEDIEVALISTA8/marques8013.html|title = O Mundo do Fantástico na Arte Românica e Gótica em Portugal.|date = |accessdate = |website = Medievalista online|publisher = Marisa Costa Marques|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corbels and Modillions===
[[Image:Exterior_Cathedral_Braga_(3).jpg|thumb|right|180px|The "horn blower" at [[Braga Cathedral]].]]
In [[Romanesque architecture]] a corbel is a structural piece of stone jutting from a wall to carry a [[wikt:superincumbent|superincumbent]] weight, a type of [[Bracket (architecture)|bracket]]. The technique of corbelling, where rows of [[corbel]]s deeply keyed inside a wall support a projecting wall or parapet, has been used since Neolithic times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Corbel, Encyclopædia Britannica|last = Chisholm|first = Hugh|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1911|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A modillion is an ornate bracket, a corbel, underneath a [[Cornice (architecture)|cornice]] and supporting it, more elaborate than [[dentil]]s (literally translated as small teeth), they were carved classically under a [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] or a [[Composite order|Composite]] cornice, but may support any type of [[eaves]] cornice.

[[Image:Iglesia_de_Sanfins_de_Friestas_(1922122488).jpg|thumb|left|240px|A '''corbel table''' with humans, animals and beasts carved in the modillions. [[Igreja de São Fins de Friestas|Sanfins de Friestas Church]].]]

Corbels in Portuguese Romanesque buildings often have an elaborately carved appearance with stylised heads of humans, animals and imaginary "beasts", or a wide range of motifs, sometimes end with a point apparently growing into the wall, or forming a knot, and often are supported by angels and other figures. In later periods the carved foliage and other ornaments used on corbels resembled those used in the [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] of [[column]]s.&lt;ref name="Portuguese Romanesque architecture, the foundation of Portugal as a Kingdom and its artistic convergence"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Portuguese Romanesque architecture, the foundation of Portugal as a Kingdom and its artistic convergence|url = https://www.academia.edu/10344015/Portuguese_Romanesque_architecture_the_foundation_of_Portugal_as_a_Kingdom_and_its_artistic_convergence|website = www.academia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another particular feature of Romanesque buildings are '''corbel tables''', a projecting moulded [[string course]] supported by a range of corbels. Sometimes these corbels carry a small [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] under the string course, the arches of which are pointed and trefoiled. As a rule corbel tables carries the [[Rain gutter|gutter]], but the arcaded corbel table was also used as a decoration to subdivide the storeys and break up the wall surface. In some buildings corbels will form a moulding, and above a plain piece of projecting wall forming a [[parapet]].&lt;ref name="ARQUITECTURA ROMÂNICA E GÓTICA NO MINHO"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/35392/1/ARQUITECTURA%20ROM%C3%82NICA%20E%20G%C3%93TICA%20NO%20MINHO.pdf|title = ARQUITECTURA ROMÂNICA E GÓTICA NO MINHO|date = |accessdate = |website = Repositório da Universidade do Minho|publisher = Paula Bessa|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apses (East ends) and apsidoles===
[[Image:Capilla_de_Santo_Abdão_da_Correlhã_(2437007714).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Simple square east end on the'Chapel of Santo Abdão.]]
One of the most striking features of a Romanesque church is its [[apse]] or "east-end", a recess covered with a hemispherical vault or semi-dome, also known as an [[Exedra]], applied to a semi-circular or polygonal termination to the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] or aisles of a church at the liturgical east end (where the altar is), regardless of the shape of the roof, which may be flat, sloping, domed, or hemispherical.&lt;ref name="A Chronology of Western Architecture"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Chronology of Western Architecture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LQMvt0lE6egC|publisher = Courier Corporation|date = 2010-06-01|isbn = 9780486476483|first = Doreen|last = Yarwood}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apses and [[Apsidiole|apsidoles]] can be either semi-circular, with or without a high chancel surrounded by an [[ambulatory]], or a square end from which an apse is projected. Apsidoles can be also be found whenever the main altar is surrounded by lateral chapels.

[[Image:Igreja_Matriz_de_Armamar_002.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 12th-century-built [[Igreja de São Miguel (Armamar)|Church of Armamar]] already has a semi-circular apse.]]

Churches in Portugal have long since followed the Pre-Romanesque kind of simple square-shaped apses typical of [[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic]] and [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic]] periods where east ends reflected the common structural plan of single-aisled churches as the main altar is separated from the nave by a [[transept]] or is just the extension of it. This style continued to be popular through the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and well into [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period.&lt;ref name="Rota do Românico"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rotadoromanico.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PerfilHistoriador/O_Romanico_em_Portugal.pdf|title = Rota do Românico|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fully Romanesque semi-circular apses started being more widespread in the regions between [[Entre-Douro-e-Minho Province|Douro and Minho]] in the second quarter of the 12th century (1125-1150), coming from the center region of [[Coimbra]] that was more open to foreign novelties as stated above. This kind of so-called "French style" semi-circular apses and apsidoles became more frequent not only in single nave churches, on which case there are no apsidoles, but particularly in three-aisled churches and monasteries built in the second half of the 12th century and during the 13th century.

===Cloisters===
[[Image:Catedral_Vieja_de_Coimbra%2C_claustro.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cloister of [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra|Coimbra Cathedral]], arcades and columns are Romanesque but its roof already presents a ribbed vault.]]

A '''[[cloister]]''' (from [[Latin]] claustrum, "enclosure") is a covered walk, open gallery, or open [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] running along the walls of buildings and forming a [[Quadrangle (architecture)|square]] or garth. The attachment of a cloister to a [[cathedral]] or church, commonly against a warm southern flank,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = On the Origins of the Medieval Cloister|last = Horn|first = Walter|publisher = Gesta 12.1/2|year = 1973|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; usually indicates that it is (or once was) part of a [[monastic]] foundation, forming a continuous and solid architectural barrier that effectively separates the world of the [[monk]]s from that of the [[serf]]s and workmen, whose lives and works went on outside and around the cloister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cloister|last = |first = |publisher = Oxford Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Claustro_Igreja_de_S._Pedro_do_Mosteiro_de_Cête_(4931341221).jpg|thumb|left|250px|'''Monastery of Cete''' cloister have simple composite capitals with no decorations.]]

Although much of the cloisters in Portuguese churches and cathedrals have been extensively remodelled in later centuries, original Romanesque ones still survived, some almost completely preserved, others in various states of ruin. In contrast to their French counterparts, they often have suffered less modern intervention, and as a result, their current state is more likely to reflect their original arrangement and to preserve more fully the character of the visual imagery found there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Pictorial Narrative in the Romanesque Cloister: Cloister Imagery &amp; Religious Life in Medieval Spain|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_2mEB4XlrcwC|publisher = Peter Lang|date = 2004-01-01|isbn = 9780820472683|first = Pamela Anne|last = Patton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most arcades and masonry walls of the cloister carries simple wooden [[shed]] roofs as barrel or groin vaulted ceilings weren't common or likely didn't survived into our days.

Cloisters provided special accommodation for the activities that took place within it: stone benches were used for reading, books were sometimes stored in cupboards or armoires built into the walls. In addition, the cloister often contained a fountain or well, where the monks could wash and draw water to drink. The single, double, and even triple and quadruple capitals of 12th-century cloisters' columns were carved with foliate forms derived from the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]], such as vine [[scroll]]s and acanthus leaves, real and imaginary animals in combat or in heraldic positions, secular images such as musicians, entertainers, hunters, saints' lives and biblical events. Piers bore narrative scenes or relief figures of apostles or saints.&lt;ref name="The Grove Encyclopedia of Medieval Art and Architecture"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Grove Encyclopedia of Medieval Art and Architecture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FtlMAgAAQBAJ|publisher = OUP USA|date = 2012-12-06|isbn = 9780195395365|first = Colum|last = Hourihane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cistercian Romanesque==
[[Image:R1033302c_(7881550954).jpg|thumb|left|250px|'''Tarouca Abbey''' copying the facade of the [[Abbey of Fontenay]].]]
The [[Cistercian architecture|Cistercian Romanesque architecture]] reflected the austerity and sobriety characteristic of that monastical Order in their quest for a mistic and spiritual goal preached by their leader and mentor Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux]].
In Portugal, besides a Cistercian Gothic-featured architecture (in which the [[Alcobaça Monastery]] is a universal symbol), there is a previous Romanesque style expressed by the '''Abbeys of Tarouca''' (construction started in 1144, the year of Cistercian monks arrival in Portugal), '''Salzedas''' (started in 1152) and [[Church of Fiães|Fiães]] (started in 1163).
&lt;ref name="Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3105.pdf|title = Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|publisher = Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:O_mosteiro.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''Amares Abbey''', one of the first of the Order of Cister in Portugal.]]

In the architecture of Cistercian churches the transept is usually quite wide and the lateral aisles are covered with groined vaults that help to sustain the longitudinal central nave. There is a clear preference for square-shaped apses, more simple and economical to build. The columns and piers supporting pointed-arched arcades (already a [[Gothic architecture|proto-Gothic]] feature), have big strong capitals and stand on rectangular blocks on the ground floor. Although Tarouca Abbey was clearly inspired in the Burgundian abbeys of [[Clairvaux Abbey|Clairvaux]] and [[Abbey of Fontenay|Fontenay]] and Salzedas still have some similarities with [[Fontfroide Abbey|Fontfroide]], their authentic and magnificent Cistercian architectural features are mixed with local Portuguese decorative motifs.&lt;ref name="Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3105.pdf|title = Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|publisher = Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of smaller churches were also influenced by Cistercian Romanesque, like the vault of [[Igreja de São Martinho de Mouros|São Martinho de Mouros]] that shows the influx of Tarouca's abbey central nave vault and the exterior capitals in the main altar of [[Igreja de São Miguel (Armamar)|Armamar]] church are significantly influenced by the outlayer of Salzedas abbey.

==Civil and military architecture==
===Domus Municipalis (Town hall) of Bragança===
[[Image:Domus_Municipalis_4.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The stonework of the '''Domus Municipalis''', located across the courtyard of [[Castelo de Bragança|Bragança Castle]].]]
The [[Domus Municipalis]] ([[Latin language|Latin]]: municipal house) is a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] building in the northeastern municipality of [[Bragança, Portugal|Bragança]]. Its exact function, name and construction date have been the onset of much debate and controversy, even after many researches during the 20th century: first it was believed it could have been the city's [[Town hall|Municipal house]] ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: "Casa da Câmara"), place of public meetings and a symbol of people's local government through their representatives, but more recent findings have presented basis for a theory that it could have served as [[cistern]], but there are still doubts if that was its primary function.

[[Image:P8093277w_(7874335812).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Upper level where the town meetings took place (cistern drains in the centre )]]

This singular (and enigmatic) building of Romanesque civic architecture also presents challenges in its dating construction. An initial thesis stated that by its design and decorative features it could have been built as early as the 10th or 11th century, but a closer look actually tells us that was, most likely, built in the first half of the 13th century. Also, a deeper research showed that the existing building might be the result of two different dating constructions, with an older cistern on its lower floor and a meeting room built on top, using the already existing structure. Doubts about its real function arouse from a document of 1501 in which the author (according to the published writings of the Abbot of Baçal (1865-1947)) referred to the local record of Martim Anes (1185-1254) who spoke of the construction of the '''Domus''' upper level during his lifetime. In this account he stated that it was used as a meeting place for the "good men" of the municipality.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Domus_Municipalis_6.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Corbel details show its Romanesque style although probably built in a later period.]]

There is another document from 1503 referring to the building as both a ''Sala da Água'' ([[English language|English]]: Water-room) and a place where the town representatives gathered to discuss and sign contracts, therefore, it should not be surprising if this supposed double-function turns out to be correct. Its construction date also becomes more clear in face of this facts, art-historian Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida noted that by its medallions, the diamond-shaped openings and the layout of windows we can date the upper level by the end of the 13th century or beginning of the 14th century, in which its already archaic Romanesque architectural style can be explained with the need of a compromise with the pre-existent cistern.&lt;ref name="Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3105.pdf|title = Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|publisher = Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located near the Castle's courtyard alongside the '''Church of Santa Maria''', the structure is based on a multi-level irregular [[pentagon]], constructed of rounded granite blocks and held together by [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]], with a barrel vaulted wooden roof supported by three arches and covered by tiles. Its floor-plan is slightly steeped and a natural water fountain was found in the Northwest corner at a low depth.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Towers and fortified houses===
[[Image:Paco_S_Cipriano.JPG|thumb|right|280px|'''Tower-House of São Cipriano''', near [[Guimarães]]. Remodelled in the 15th and 18th centuries, its tower and main building date back to the early 12th century.]]
In sharp contrast to the reality throughout most of Europe, there are still some examples of Portuguese [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque civil architecture]] that survived to our days, specially the fortified noble residences or [[Tower house|Domus Fortis]] (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]:"Casa-Torre"). Most are no longer more than single towers that stand out from more modern constructions carried out in the house that surrounds them, and many were remodelled in later [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] styles, but their Romanesque features are still very much visible. These noble fortified manors were built within, or in the periphery, of feudal lands ([[Feudalism|Coutos or Honras]]), among agricultural fertile valleys. We can also find them in neighbouring areas of forests or mountain ranges where nobility could control new farm lands outside more occupied regions in which the purchase of new lands and titles was more difficult.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Solar_Azevedo_(43).JPG|thumb|left|280px|'''Azevedo Tower-House''', in [[Braga]] (13th century). Nowadays, like many manors, is a rural-tourism guest house.]]

Among those we have the manors and towers of '''Vilar''' ([[Penafiel]]), '''Pousada''' ([[Guimarães]]), [[Dornelas (Amares)|Dornelas]] in [[Braga]], '''Oriz''' ([[Vila Verde]]), '''Lourosa do Campo''' ([[Arouca, Portugal|Arouca]]) and '''Quintela''' ([[Vila Real, Portugal|Vila Real]]). In northern Portugal there were two kinds of fortified houses during the Middle Ages: the [[Manor house]] and the [[Tower house|Domus Fortis]].&lt;ref name="Torres, casas-torres ou casas-fortes: a concepção do espaço de habitação da pequena e média nobreza na Baixa Idade Média (sécs.

This kind of model was adopted by the smaller ranks of nobility in search of social ascension in a way of displaying to local communities their newly acquired power.&lt;ref name="Torres, casas-torres ou casas-fortes: a concepção do espaço de habitação da pequena e média nobreza na Baixa Idade Média (sécs.

[[Image:Solar_dos_Pinheiros.JPG|thumb|right|290px|'''Pinheiro''' fortress-house, built by late 14th and early 15h centuries still, near [[Guimarães]].]]

The [[Tower house|Domus Fortis]] is composed by several divisions:

- The most important being the [[Fortified tower|Tower]], of square plan (round ones were rare in Portugal), fortifying the house and offering protection to their owners and respective [[Serfdom|servants]] in case of need. It was built with four levels, each corresponding to a single division. Just like a keep tower in castles, the main gate was accessed by the first floor rather than the ground floor. This ground floor was the reception and living room, as the upper floors were destined for private chambers.

- A "domus fortis" also had a separate building coupled with or close to the tower, with rectangular plan and two floors. Those were usually the servants area and accommodations.

- In some cases is reported the existence of a private chapel like in [[Pedro Martins, Lord of the Tower of Vasconcelos|Vasconcelos Tower-house]]. Also other individual structures, like kitchens, were built close to water springs or small streams. No remains are left from these buildings although their existence if fully documented.&lt;ref name="Torres, casas-torres ou casas-fortes: a concepção do espaço de habitação da pequena e média nobreza na Baixa Idade Média (sécs.

Most of tower-houses were built in northern and central regions of Portugal that belonged to feudal areas. Some were progressively restored in later centuries reflecting more modern [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] styles: like [[Aguiã]], [[Ponte de Lima|Refoios]], '''Gomariz''', [[Castro, Portugal|Castro]], '''Faralães''' and '''Barbosa''' Tower-Houses. In other cases their towers were separated from the main building like '''Silva''', '''Quintela''', '''Oriz''' and [[Tower of Penegate|Penegate]] Towers, among others.

===Bridges===
[[Image:Ponte_Lagoncinha_-_Lousado.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Ponte de Lagoncinha|Lagoncinha Bridge]] over the [[Ave River]], built in the 12th century on the road between [[Braga]] and [[Porto]].]]
Construction activity of [[bridge]]s during the [[Middle Ages]] is directly related to the need of restoring the old [[Roman roads|Roman road system]] that was already obsolete, in order to develop new connections and boost trading. Since the end of the 11th century that need was so urgent that building bridges and restoring the paveways were activities that started to be considered as pious. [[Gonçalo de Amarante|São Gonçalo of Amarante]] and '''São Lourenço Mendes''', sponsors of the construction of [[Amarante, Portugal|Amarante]] and '''Cavês''' bridges, respectively, were called saints by popular acclamation, such as [[Pont Saint-Bénézet|Saint Benizet of Avignon]] (France) or '''Sán Domingos da Calçada''' ([[La Rioja (Spain)]]), showing how much this phenomenon of bridge and road construction were considered extremely important elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ponte_do_Porto_04.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Ponte do Porto|Porto Bridge]] over the [[Cávado River]], built in the 11th century.]]

In the will of monarchs, noblemen and clergymen there are many references to donations for building bridges, King [[Afonso I of Portugal|D.Afonso Henriques]] (1109-1185) himself contributed to the construction of [[Coimbra]], [[Ave River|Ave]] and '''Piares''' ([[Douro]] river) bridges.
The stonemasons of the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] period were more careful about the structural design and maintenance of bridges than their previous [[Roman Empire|Roman]] counterparts, and looked for more solid grounds to build them, and because of that, according to Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida, medieval bridges resisted better against the danger of floodings and the test of time.
&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ponte_de_Prado_(4).JPG|thumb|left|250px|[[Ponte do Prado|Prado Bridge]] over the [[Cávado River]], although originally Roman it was rebuilt in the early 12th century.]]

Romanesque bridges present large [[arch]]es whose height had to be balanced with the use of [[abutment]]s at each end by transferring the weight of the bridge and its loads partially into a horizontal thrust restrained by the abutments at either side. Bridge builders also improved on the Roman structures by using narrower [[pier]]s, thinner arch barrels and lower span-rise ratios.
Examples of these are the bridges of [[Ponte de Lagoncinha|Lagoncinha]] (12th century), over the [[Ave River]], with six arches, [[Ponte do Prado|Prado]] bridge over the [[Cávado River]] (11th century), with nine arches and '''Cavês''' bridge over the [[Tâmega River]] (13th century).&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridge building deeply shaped the Portuguese medieval landscape. Among the Romanesque civil architecture and by the economical and technical means used for their construction, the building of bridges had the most impact in everyday life, benefiting communication between people.

===Castles===
{{See also|Castles in Portugal}}

[[Image:19.4.14_Guimaraes_61_(13917539186).jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''[[Guimarães Castle]]''', built in the 10th century, its current look is the result of late 13th-century enlargements.]]
In Portugal, [[castle]]s are directly related with military needs and the state of continuous warfare characterised by the [[Reconquista]]. Populations living closer of the border between Christians and Muslims were under threat of constant raids and the advance of either sides in pursue of territorial conquest. The region more precociously fortified was the area south of the [[Douro]] river, where in the 10th century almost all the population centers had their castle. The majority of these defensive positions, the rural castles, were of very simple structure and took advantage of natural conditions such as high places with [[Granite|granite outcrops]], that made access difficult. During the next three centuries (10th to 13th centuries) we witness a boom of castles due to the ever-growing necessity to provide a territorial passive defense.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Celorico_de_Basto_2.JPG|thumb|left|250px|'''Arnoia Castle''', built in the late 11th century, offered protection to a nearby monastery.]]

The strength of a Romanesque castle sits in the thickness and height of its walls in order to resist sieges. The [[Chemin de ronde|Allure or round-path]] ([[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]]: Adarve) was intertwinned with towers in order to break continuous cloths of wall and in the 12th century other outer sets of walls were built next to castles themselves to shelter populations and cattle as attested in the [[Castle of Castro Laboreiro]].&lt;ref name="Portuguese Romanesque architecture, the foundation of Portugal as a Kingdom and its artistic convergence"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Portuguese Romanesque architecture, the foundation of Portugal as a Kingdom and its artistic convergence|url = https://www.academia.edu/10344015/Portuguese_Romanesque_architecture_the_foundation_of_Portugal_as_a_Kingdom_and_its_artistic_convergence|website = www.academia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romanesque castle testifies to the triumph of rural nobility and is also the symbol of a territory's safety. During this period it consisted of a wall with [[Chemin de ronde|allures]], [[battlement]]s and a central tower: the [[Keep]], symbol of feudal power, and the biggest innovation to the fortress. This element has its origins in the [[Tower house|domus fortis]], the strengthened noble residence.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tor_mit_(Zug-)_Brücke_zum_Castelo_do_Lindoso.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Main gate of '''Lindoso Castle''' and its [[drawbridge]].]]

Between the North and the South of Portugal, particularly in the regions defined by the margins of the [[Mondego River|Mondego]] and [[Tagus|Tejo]] Rivers, there are notable differences in military structures. In the North castles have a more basic structure and are very tied to fortifications typified in [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|pre-Romanesque]] era. Going southwards castles display more advanced techniques in the field of military architecture. The strategic area was then concentrated on the border with the [[Moors]] where the [[Military order (monastic society)|Military Orders]] would play a key role. In the North we can find the castles of [[Castelo de Lanhoso|Lanhoso]], [[Castle of Castro Laboreiro|Castro Laboreiro]], [[Castelo de Lindoso|Lindoso]], [[Castelo de Melgaço|Melgaço]], [[Castelo de Arnóia|Arnoia]], [[Castelo de Pena de Aguiar|Pena de Aguiar]], [[Castelo de Trancoso|Trancoso]], [[Castelo de Vilar Maior|Vilar Maior]], and the most outstanding [[Guimarães Castle]]. This fortress, documented since around 950 AD, had undergone restoration works during the reign of [[Afonso I of Portugal|D.Afonso Henriques]] and later changes in its layout in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Castelo_de_Lanhoso_(7).JPG|thumb|left|250px|Battlements and the round-path at '''Póvoa de Lanhoso Castle''', late 11th century.]]

Built under the tenure of [[Gualdim Pais]] as Master of the [[Knights Templar]] (1157-1195), the castles of [[Castle of Pombal|Pombal]] (c.1156), [[Convent of Christ (Tomar)|Tomar]] (1160), [[Castelo de Monsanto|Monsanto]] (1165), [[Castelo de Penas Róias|Penas Roias]] (1166), [[Castle of Almourol|Almourol]] (1171) and [[Castelo de Longroiva|Longroiva]] (1174) demonstrate the importance of the Templars in the development of Portuguese military architecture during the second half of the 12th century. The first document stating the Knights Templar presence in Portugal dates back to 1128, when Queen [[Theresa, Countess of Portugal|D.Teresa]] donated them the castle of [[Soure Castle|Soure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PT-TT-OCCT-A-5-1-1_m0001.TIF - Carta de doação de D. Teresa, rainha de Portugal, do Castelo de Soure concedida ao Templo de Salomão - Arquivo Nacional da Torre do Tombo - DigitArq|url = http://digitarq.dgarq.gov.pt/viewer?id=4251189|website = digitarq.dgarq.gov.pt|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its keep, built on the north side of the fortress, retains a distinctive feature: the [[Levee|Alambor]], a reinforced base for the tower using a stone-slanted ramp. This solution gives it greater strength and makes an assault on its walls harder to accomplish. This feature can also be seen in the Keep of Pombal Castle.

At Tomar Castle, headquarters of the Order in Portugal, the alambor was built along the outer walls of the fortification. With origins in the military architecture developed by the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] in the [[Holy Land]], this constructive technique was used in the castle of [[Citadel of Salah Ed-Din|Saône]] and the [[Krak des Chevaliers]], both located in [[Syria]], where Gualdim Pais was stationed between 1151 and 1156. It owns to the Templar Order some of the most innovative solutions that the Portuguese military architecture met throughout the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Romanesque Art in Portugal"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sgfm.elcorteingles.es/SGFM/FRA/recursos/doc/Libros/879611670_1042012165947.pdf|title = Romanesque Art in Portugal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition to Gothic architecture==
{{See also|Portuguese Gothic architecture}}
[[Image:La_Orden_del_Temple_y_el_"art_gotique".jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Church of Santa Maria do Olival]], built by the Knights Templar around 1170, was one of the first buildings reflecting the newly arrived [[Gothic architecture]] maintaining a Romanesque structural shape.]]
The arrival of the [[Cistercians]] in Portugal after 1142 coincided with the first steps on the development of the new [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] artistical style in France. Those initial Gothic features (pointed [[arch]], taller and slimmer [[column]]s, [[Groin vault|groin]] and [[rib vault]]s, [[flying buttress]]es and more [[Rose window|windows]]), although still with much Romanesque flavour, were implemented in Cistercian abbeys as they matched the exact kind of austere and ascetic teachings preached by their leader and mentor Saint Bernard of Clairvaux.&lt;ref name="Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3105.pdf|title = Primeiras Impressões sobre a Arquitectura Românica Portuguesa|date = 2001|accessdate = |website = Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto|publisher = Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Igreja_de_São_João_de_Alporão.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Igreja de São João de Alporão|Church of São João do Alporão]], built by the Knights Hospitaller after 1185, also presents early Gothic features like the rose window or the non-decorated portal.]]

Thus, in Portugal, the strong presence and popularity of Romanesque until later centuries meant that this decorative and architectural Cistercian model was the perfect basis for the slow change into Gothic style, without never completely cutting off with the previous Romanesque. Instead, these two styles merged in Portuguese architecture like nowhere else in Europe within a specific kind called '''Mendicant Gothic''', typical of monastic buildings. [[Alcobaça Monastery|Alcobaça]], one of the biggest Cistercian abbeys in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://repositorio.ucp.pt/bitstream/10400.14/4973/1/LS_S1_04_MaurCocheril.pdf|title = ABADIAS CISTERCIENSES PORTUGUESAS|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Cocheril|first = Frei Maur}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the first fully Gothic building in Portugal, but it still has a heavy and austere exterior appearance, only balanced by its tall and massive [[rib vault]]ed central [[nave]] and [[aisle]]s. Churches like [[Church of Santa Maria do Olival|Santa Maria dos Olivais]] in [[Tomar]], or [[Igreja de São João de Alporão|São João de Alporão]] in [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]] are perfect examples of this Mendicant transitional period between the Romanesque and the definitive settle of Gothic style, which would only be a reality by the 14th and 15th centuries.&lt;ref name="ARQUITECTURA ROMÂNICA E GÓTICA NO MINHO"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/35392/1/ARQUITECTURA%20ROM%C3%82NICA%20E%20G%C3%93TICA%20NO%20MINHO.pdf|title = ARQUITECTURA ROMÂNICA E GÓTICA NO MINHO|date = |accessdate = |website = Repositório da Universidade do Minho|publisher = Paula Bessa|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Evoros_katedra.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Lateral view of [[Cathedral of Évora|Évora Cathedral]], where its massive buttresses give a very Romanesque look.]]

[[Cathedral of Évora|Évora Cathedral]] is another example of Romanesque/Gothic transition, combining both in a single monument. Built between 1186 and 1204 (but only fully completed by 1250) with a clear Romanesque outlook, it was again enlarged circa 1280-1340, this time in early Gothic style. The cathedral received several valuable additions through time, such as the cloisters (Gothic period - 14th century), or its [[Dome|zimborium]] (dome), built in the late 13th century and another addition already showing the new Gothic features.&lt;ref name="ARQUITECTURA ROMÂNICA E GÓTICA NO MINHO"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/35392/1/ARQUITECTURA%20ROM%C3%82NICA%20E%20G%C3%93TICA%20NO%20MINHO.pdf|title = ARQUITECTURA ROMÂNICA E GÓTICA NO MINHO|date = |accessdate = |website = Repositório da Universidade do Minho|publisher = Paula Bessa|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanesque never truly ceased to be expressed in various ways both decorative and structural until as late as the 16th century, thus most historians name it as '''Resistance Romanesque''', referring to a specific kind of buildings that present a very marked statement of this period even if mixed with later artistical styles ([[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Manueline]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]]). Some examples of those are the Churches of [[Igreja Matriz de Caminha|Caminha]], (built in the late 15th century), '''Torre de Moncorvo''' (built in the early 16th century), and the '''Cathedral of Viana do Castelo''' (also from the 15th century).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8720">'''''Poshlost''''' or '''''Poshlost' ''''' ({{lang-rus |по́шлость |p= ˈpoʂləsʲtʲ}}) is a Russian word  for a particular negative human character trait or man-made thing or idea.  It has been cited as an example of an [[Untranslatability|untranslatable]] word, as there is no single exact English equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://rbth.com/blogs/2014/05/29/a_question_of_taste_the_untranslatable_word_poshlost_37047.html | title = A question of taste: The untranslatable word 'poshlost' | last = Mikheev | first = Alexey | date = 29 May 2014 | website = Russia Beyond The Headlines | access-date = 12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It carries much cultural baggage in [[Russia]] and has been discussed at length by various writers.

It is derived from the adjective 
[[:wikt:пошлый|пошлый]].

==Description==
It has been defined as "petty evil or self-satisfied [[vulgarity]]",{{Sfn | Alexandrov | 1991 | p = 106}} while [[Svetlana Boym]]{{Sfn | Boym | 2001 | p = 279}} defines it briefly as "[[obscenity]] and bad taste".

Boym goes on to describe it at more length:{{Sfn | Boym | 1994 | p = 41}}
{{quote |''Poshlost’'' is the Russian version of banality, with a characteristic national flavoring of metaphysics and high morality, and a peculiar conjunction of the sexual and the spiritual.  This one word encompasses triviality, vulgarity, sexual promiscuity, and a lack of spirituality.  The war against ''poshlost’'' was a cultural obsession of the Russian and Soviet intelligentsia from the 1860s to 1960s.}}

Early examinations of ''poshlost'' in literature are in the work of [[Nikolai Gogol]].  Gogol wrote (of [[Pushkin]]),&lt;!--Please leave the following quotation as the author wrote it, including the part in brackets.--&gt;
{{Quote | He used to say of me that no other writer before me possessed the gift to expose so brightly life's ''poshlust'', to depict so powerfully the ''poshlust'' of a ''poshlusty'' man [''poshlost' poshlovo cheloveka''] in such a way that everybody's eyes would be opened wide to all the petty trivia that often escape our attention." | "The Third Letter à Propos ''Dead Souls''", 1843, quoted and translated by Davydov, 1995.  Brackets in original.  See below for his transliteration "poshlust".}}

In his novels, [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgenev]] "tried to develop a heroic figure who could, with the verve and abandon of a [[Don Quixote]], grapple with the problems of Russian society, who could once and for all overcome 'poshlost’, the complacent mediocrity and moral degeneration of his environment".{{Sfn | Lindstrom | 1966 | p = 149}}  [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky |Dostoyevsky]] applied the word to the [[Satan |Devil]]; [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn|Solzhenitsyn]], to Western-influenced young people.{{Sfn | Boym | 1994 | page = 41}}

[[D. S. Mirsky]] was an early user of the word in English in writing about Gogol; he defined it as "'self-satisfied inferiority,' moral and spiritual".{{Sfn | Mirsky | 1927 | p = 158}}  [[Vladimir Nabokov]] made it more widely known in his book on Gogol, where he romanized it as "'''poshlust'''" (punningly: "[[wikt:posh|posh]]" + "[[lust]]"). Poshlust, Nabokov explained, "is not only the obviously trashy but mainly the falsely important, the falsely beautiful, the falsely clever, the falsely attractive.  A list of literary characters personifying ''poshlust'' will include... Polonius and the royal pair in ''[[Hamlet]]'', Rodolphe and Homais from ''[[Madame Bovary]]'', Laevsky in [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]'s 'The Duel', [[James Joyce|Joyce]]'s [[Molly Bloom|Marion [Molly] Bloom]], young Bloch in ''[[In Search of Lost Time|Search of Lost Time]]'', [[Guy de Maupassant |Maupassant]]'s '[[Bel Ami]]', [[Anna Karenina]]'s husband, and Berg in ''[[War and Peace]]''".{{Sfn | Nabokov | 1944 | p = 70 | ps = .  Brackets added.}} {{Harvnb | Nabokov | 1973}} also listed
{{quote |Corny trash, vulgar clichés, [[Philistinism]] in all its phases, imitations of imitations, bogus profundities, crude, moronic and dishonest pseudo-literature&amp;mdash;these are obvious examples.  Now, if we want to pin down poshlost in contemporary writing we must look for it in Freudian symbolism, moth-eaten mythologies, social comment, humanistic messages, political allegories, overconcern with class or race, and the journalistic generalities we all know.}}

[[Azar Nafisi]] mentions it and quotes the "falsely" definition in ''[[Reading Lolita in Tehran]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = The Guardian | place = [[United Kingdom |UK]] | url = http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,1039915,00.html | title = Books | type = review}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nabokov often targeted ''poshlost'' in his own work; the Alexandrov definition above refers to the character of M'sieur Pierre in ''[[Invitation to a Beheading]]''.

Another notable literary treatment is [[Fyodor Sologub]]'s novel ''[[Fyodor Sologub#The Petty Demon|The Petty Demon]]''.  It tells the story of a provincial schoolteacher, Peredonov, notable for his complete lack of redeeming human qualities. [[James H. Billington]]{{Sfn | Billington | 1966 | page = 494}} said of it:
{{quote|The book puts on display a Freudian treasure chest of perversions with subtlety and credibility.  The name of the novel's hero, Peredonov, became a symbol of calculating [[concupiscence]] for an entire generation...  [Peredonov] seeks not the ideal world but the world of petty venality and sensualism, ''poshlost'.''  He torments his students, derives erotic satisfaction from watching them kneel to pray, and systematically befouls his apartment before leaving it as part of his generalized spite against the universe.}}

[[Richard Taruskin]] summarized poshlost as "highfalutin bad taste," applying the term to a performance of the [[Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution (Prokofiev)]].

'''''Reflections''''' by [[Idries Shah]] is a collection of eighty fables, aphorisms, and statements that seek to challenge the conditioned mind. The book intends to confront the reader with unaccustomed perspectives and ideas, in an attempt to set the mind free, to see how things really are.&lt;ref name=Octagon&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Reflections|url=http://www.octagonpress.com/titles/books/refl.htm|work=Octagon Press|accessdate=4 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807161507/http://www.octagonpress.com/titles/books/refl.htm|archivedate=7 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the book’s foreword states, "Do you imagine that fables exist only to amuse or to instruct, and are based upon fiction? The best ones are delineations of what happens in real life, in the community and in the individual’s mental processes".&lt;ref name=Reflections&gt;{{cite book|last=Shah|first=Idries|title=Reflections|year=1968|publisher=Octagon Press|location=London|isbn=0 900860 07 3|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content== 
''Reflections'' is a collection of a foreword and eighty brief literary pieces which were designed for reflection. Many are as brief as this example:

{{Quotation|History is not usually what has happened. History is what some people have thought to be significant.}}

==Reception==
This small, pocket-sized book was well received by critics. In her review in ''The Observer'', author [[Doris Lessing]] called ''Reflections'' "... a lively collection of fables, comments, aphorisms, its quality astringency."&lt;ref name=Observer&gt;{{cite news|last=Lessing|first=Doris|newspaper=The Observer|title=Some Kind of a Cake|date=January 19, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Times Book Review'' called it "... witty, tart and instructional - they tend to come into your mind at appropriate moments."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Lessing|first=Doris|newspaper=New York Times Book Review|title=What Looks Like an Egg and Is An Egg|date=May 7, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pat Williams, reviewing for BBC's Review of the Year, stated that ''Reflections'' was "Very funny ... more wisdom than I have found in any other book this year. I found myself sitting up straight."

'''Samādhi''' (Hindi: समाधि) or '''samadhi mandir''' is the [[Hindi]] name for a temple commemorating the dead (similar to a [[tomb]] or [[mausoleum]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dict.hinkhoj.com/words/meaning-of-SAMADHI-in-hindi.html|title=Hindi dictionary (Samadhi)|publisher=|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/samadhi?q=Samadhi|title=Oxford Dictionary - American English|publisher=|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/samadhi|title=Oxford Dictionary - English|publisher=|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may or may not contain the body of the deceased. Samadhi sites are often built in this way to honor people regarded as [[saint]]s or [[guru]]s in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] religious traditions, wherein such souls are said to have passed into ''[[Mahasamādhi|mahāsamādhi]]'', or were already in ''[[Samadhi|samādhi]]'' (non-dualistic state of consciousness) at the time of death. 

The tradition of India is [[cremation]] for most Hindu people at the time of death, while samadhi is generally reserved for very advanced souls, such as yogis and saints, who have already been "purified by the fire of yoga"&lt;ref&gt;Georg Feuerstein, ''The Encyclopedia of Yoga and Tantra'' (Boston: Shambhala Publications, 2011 ), p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; or who are believed to have been in the state of ''samadhi'' at time of death. Samadhi doesn’t involve cremation.

One of the popular site of pilgrimage in India is the town of [[Alandi]] in the state of [[Maharashtra]] where the 13th century [[Varkari]] saint [[Dnyaneshwar]] took Sanjivan Samadhi or entombed himself in the state of Samadhi.His devotees believe that he is still alive{{sfn|Novetzke|2009|p=218}}{{sfn|Glushkova|2014|p=116}}.

The Persian weekly journal '''''Sur-e Esrafil''''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: صور اسراقیل; [[Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft|DMG]]: Ṣūr-e Esrāfīl; [[English language|English]]: “Trumpet of Esrafil“) was published between May 1907 and March 1909. The first 32 issues were published by the founder of the journal, [[Mirza Jahangir Khan |Mirza Jahangir Khan (1870-1908)]], an Iranian author and journalist. With its liberal as well as revolutionary orientation ''Sur-e Esrafil'' contributed significantly to support the [[Constitutional Revolution]]. The editor published articles criticising strongly the high-class and the social situation of the country that time and discussing controversial between conservatives and modern religion.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Christl Catanzaro: "Leserbriefe in Ṣûr-e Esrâfîl und Rûḥ ul-Qods als Forum des Informationsaustausches für die Intelligenzija der Mašrûṭîyat-Zeit“. In: Herzog, Christoph, Raoul Monika und Anja Pastor-Hatam (Hgg.): Presse und Öffentlichkeit im Nahen Osten. Heidelberg 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; But the journal became well-known and famous due to its literary satirical elements. [[Ali Akbar Dehkhoda]] (1879-1956) was responsible for the satirical articles of the column „Charand-o Parand“ („Nonsense“). He had a simple linguistic style in contrast to the rather literary style addressing the educated people. In this way he wanted to reach the majority of the population and to address the daily problems of the common people.&lt;ref&gt;Edward G. Browne: The Press and Poetry of Modern Persia. Cambridge 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the repressions and on the command of [[Mohammad Ali Shah]] the journal was finally suspended in June 1908. Mirza Jahangir Khan was arrested and executed. In January 1909 ''Sur-e Esrafil'' was revived under Dekhoda who published further 3 issues of the journal from [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. Christl Catanzaro: "Leserbriefe in Ṣûr-e Esrâfîl und Rûḥ ul-Qods als Forum des Informationsaustausches für die Intelligenzija der Mašrûṭîyat-Zeit“.

'''The Newtown Neurotics''' (later just '''The Neurotics''') are an [[English people|English]] [[punk rock]] group formed in [[Harlow]], [[Essex]], [[England]], in 1979. They are noted for their openly [[political music]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=newtown_neurotics&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As The Newtown Neurotics, the band began their career playing punk heavily indebted stylistically to [[The Clash]] and [[The Ramones]]. They released a series of [[single (music)|singles]] from 1979 – later collected on the album ''45 Revolutions per Minute'' – and debut album ''Beggars Can Be Choosers'' in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/album/beggers-can-be-choosers-mw0000470020&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the 1980s, the band dropped the "Newtown" from its name and became simply The Neurotics; along with the name change came a stylistic broadening, including slower tempos and horn arrangements. They released several albums on noted UK postpunk label [[Jungle Records]] including ''Repercussions'' in 1986 and ''Is Your Washroom Breeding Bolsheviks'' in 1988. 

Lead singer and guitarist Steve Drewett took openly [[socialist]] stances in his lyrics throughout the course of the band's career and currently displays an [[Anarcho-Syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] sticker on his guitar. From 1986 the Neurotics became one of the first [[Western world|Western]] bands to play behind the [[Iron Curtain]], with successive tours of [[East Germany]] alongside artists like [[Billy Bragg]] and [[Attila the Stockbroker]].&lt;ref&gt;http://steve-drewett.com/neurotics/ddr/ddr.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

When bassist Colin Dredd contracted [[pleurisy]], he left the band; Mac (Travis Cut /The Pharaohs /The Skabilly Rebels) was brought in to play bass for some farewell shows (at which the band's entire catalogue was played), and the band called it quits in October 1988. 

==Post break-up==
Drewett went on to form "Afropunk" band The Indestructible Beat,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discogs.com/artist/741561-The-Indestructible-Beat&lt;/ref&gt; which disbanded in 1995. Drewett also played sporadic solo gigs, including visits to [[North Korea]] and [[Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;http://steve-drewett.com/neurotics/interviews/dtp2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He released his debut solo album ''KuJenga Society'' in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://steve-drewett.com/steve-drewett/vivlarockkujenga%20review.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Reformation==
The band reformed as The Newtown Neurotics for reunion shows in London and Brighton leading up to Blackpool's 2006 Wasted and 2008 Rebellion punk festivals, their biggest British audiences to date. A new rhythm section of David Walsh (Drums) and Adam Smith (Bass) (Both from [[Harlow|Harlow Newtown]]) backed Steve Drewett from 2007, including an appearance in the Empress Ballroom, [[Blackpool]] for the 2009 Rebellion Festival. In 2010 Steve Drewett made his first US appearance, playing at [[The Big Takeover]] magazine's 30th Anniversary festival.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

In 2015 Simon Lomond rejoined the band for a string of dates including a return to the Rebellion Festival. Original bassist, Colin Dredd (Masters), died on 19 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/24/colin-dredd-obituary&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tonya &amp; Nancy: The Inside Story''''' is a 1994 American [[television film|made-for-television]] [[Biography|biographical]] [[Satire|satirical]]-[[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written by Phil Penningroth and directed by [[Larry Shaw (director)|Larry Shaw]]. It stars [[Alexandra Powers]] as [[Tonya Harding]] and [[Heather Langenkamp]] as [[Nancy Kerrigan]] and focuses on the [[Tonya Harding#Attack on Nancy Kerrigan and aftermath|January 1994 attack]] on Kerrigan and the extensive media coverage surrounding the infamous incident. It was released on [[NBC]] in April 1994, based on [[public domain]] material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-08-26/features/9408260191_1_nancy-kerrigan-movie-night-tv-audience|title=Remember Nancy And Tonya?|first=Jessica|last=Seigel |newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=August 26, 1994|accessdate=August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film portrays [[Figure Skating|figure skaters]] [[Tonya Harding]] and [[Nancy Kerrigan]], and the extensive media coverage following the infamous [[Tonya Harding#Attack on Nancy Kerrigan and aftermath|1994 attack]] on Kerrigan. It features a [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] breaking of the [[fourth wall]] by having [[Dennis Boutsikaris]] play its screenwriter, addressing the audience over the course of the story. It also features, as labelled by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', various "witnesses" of [[Greek chorus]] [[actors]], discussing their perspectives of different issues and themes as they emerge in the story. One of the last lines in it is "We imprisoned [Tonya and Nancy] in images we use to sell newspapers, soup, and TV movies. They're victims of those that the media serve".&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;

==Production==
When asked about her role as Tonya, Alexandra Powers stated "In a lot of ways, it's the role of the year. Nothing like this ever happened in figure skating. Tonya and Nancy were all over the media, day in and day out. To me, Tonya has the best poker face I've ever seen. With all the controversy going down, she had a smile on her face. She still went to the Olympics. That makes an actor interested. She's either really innocent or deep in denial or she's insane."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-04-15/news/9404150479_1_alexandra-powers-tonya-and-nancy-skater-tonya-harding|title=Alexandra Powers Of 'L.A. Law' Laces Up An Attitude For Tonya Role|agency=Philadelphia Inquirer|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=April 15, 1994|accessdate=August 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The film premiered on [[NBC]] on April 30, 1994, with a rating of 10.4 and share of 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvtango.com/movie/tonya_and_nancy_the_inside_story|title=Tonya &amp; Nancy: The Inside Story|last=|first=|date=|website=TV Tango|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Ray Loynd of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated that ''Tonya &amp; Nancy: The Inside Story'' "intelligently captures the chaos of the source material. The story may reek of moral squalor and may already be played out in the print and electronic media, but the moviemakers almost make it look fresh." He enjoyed how the "''[[Rashomon]]''-style multiple viewpoints and array of talking witnesses, presented à la the movie ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'', continually propel the narrative", giving it a [[Satire|satirical]] tone. Loynd liked how Alexandra Powers portrayed Harding as stranded between [[figure skating]]'s culture of gentility and her rural heritage. He thought that the film did convey the pressures of competitive sports and the relentless demand to win. Loynd also admired the [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] perspective of a scene with television network executives debating how to tell this very story.&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1994/tv/reviews/tonya-nancy-the-inside-story-1200436535/|title=Tonya &amp; Nancy: The Inside Story|last=Loynd|first=Ray|date=April 29, 1994|website=Variety|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott Williams of [[The Associated Press]] praised how writer Phil Penningroth [[Frame story|framed the narrative]] cleverly, beginning with a [[close-up]] of [[Dennis Boutsikaris]], as the film's screenwriter, musing "Sometimes, I think this could be a [[Anti-fairy tale|fairy tale]]...one of those strange dark tales, where monsters eat little children." He liked that ''Tonya &amp; Nancy: The Inside Story'' was "interpretive", and thought it was generally well crafted, acted, and sometimes poignant. Williams wrote that Alexandra Powers successfully portrayed Harding's insecurities and vulnerability, and that director [[Larry Shaw (director)|Larry Shaw]] kept the story engaging. He also wrote that, although the film could have been "a hasty 'ripped from the headlines' movie-of-the-week with cartoon characters...overacting stale emotions and restating public record", ''Tonya &amp; Nancy'' emerged as less of an "evidence photo" and more of a character study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/32f312e2053ef3efcb7abd01bc4feb0d| title=NBC's 'Tonya and Nancy: The Inside Story' Transcends Its Genre|first=Scott|last=Williams|agency=The Associated Press|date=April 29, 1994|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John J. O'Connor (journalist)|John J. O'Connor]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the story held few surprises, yet he too admired Phil Penningroth's method of [[Frame story|structuring the narrative]]. O'Connor liked the [[Dennis Boutsikaris]] character alluding to [[Anti-fairy tale|fairy tale]]s while addressing the audience about Tonya and Nancy: "Once upon a time there were two little girls..." He praised how various perspectives were offered regarding the [[caricature]]s of "Nancy the Good" and "Tonya the Bad". O'Connor also enjoyed the [[metafiction]]al scene of television network executives discussing how to produce ''Tonya &amp; Nancy'': "an ingenious ploy to undercut any suggestion of NBC cupidity". He liked that the film commented about how the [[Olympism|Olympic ideal]] has evolved and thought that [[James Wilder (actor)|James Wilder]] portrayed Jeff Gillooly as a compelling character. O'Connor believed that ''Tonya &amp; Nancy: The Inside Story'' generally avoided the artifice of other [[docudrama]]s that "have a nasty habit of distorting facts." He also believed Harding was portrayed with fitting sympathy, as the film chronicled her undoing. The last line in the film was the screenwriter feeling sorry for her: "Some fairy tales don't have a happy ending".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/29/arts/tv-weekend-how-a-confederate-widow-became-the-oldest.html|title=TV Weekend; 'Tonya &amp; Nancy: The Inside Story', NBC|last=O'Connor|first=John J.|date=April 29, 1994|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Jicha of the ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'' also praised the film's narrative, but did not believe it offered an "inside story" with "significant information". He liked that two versions of Jeff Gillooly approaching the conspiracy meeting are presented, and that "it is up to the viewer to sort out what to believe". Jicha wrote that ''Tonya &amp; Nancy: The Inside Story'' was "more Tonya's story than Nancy's", and noted that Harding's mother was portrayed as a greater "domineering" influence over Harding than Gillooly. He also liked that Nancy Kerrigan was represented compassionately with some dimension as she struggles with self-doubt. Jicha was also impressed that "NBC doesn't spare itself" in the [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] network executives scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-04-30/lifestyle/9404280609_1_tonya-and-nancy-tonya-harding-nancy-kerrigan|title=Insight's Out - In Tonya Tale - Film Is Slick Narrative But No New Details Emerge|last=Jicha|first=Tom|date=April 30, 1994|newspaper=Sun-Sentinel|access-date=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Shales]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' did not believe the film transcended the "tedious account of that big news story all America is sick to death of". Shales wrote that screenwriter Phil Penningroth did explore themes of celebrity, notoriety, and [[media ethics]] – but did so inadequately. He wrote that one of the weaknesses of the film was that none of the characters had a chance to be credible personalities. Shales thought that portions of the film bordered on [[cliché]], although he did concede to some effective comedic moments. He praised the performances of Powers and Langenkamp, stating "Alexandra Powers and Heather Langenkamp do look like Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan and do passable impressions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/olympics1998/history/timeline/articles/time_043094.htm |title='Tonya and Nancy: The Inside Story'|last=Shales|first=Tom|date=April 30, 1994|website=The Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-04-30/features/1994120064_1_inside-story-tonya-and-nancy-tonya-harding|title='Most Wanted' looks for 300th fugitive|last=Bianculli|first=David|date=April 30, 1994|website=The Baltimore Sun|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; praised Langenkamp's portrayal of Kerrigan but was more negative towards Powers' performance stating "Ms. Langenkamp wastes a decent performance here, but Alexandra Powers of ''[[L.A. Law]]'' is woefully miscast as Tonya Harding."

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-30/entertainment/ca-52145_1_thin-ice|title=NBC's 'Tonya and Nancy' on Very Thin Ice : TV Review: The network criticizes itself in the movie, but that doesn't make it any better.|last=Rosenburg|first=Howard|date=April 30, 1994|website=Los Angeles Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave the film a negative review stating:
:"By sharply criticizing itself for existing, ''Tonya &amp; Nancy: The Inside Story'' is television's first movie in years to have its own out-of-body experience. Unfortunately, that in no way enhances the experience of watching it."
:"Ridiculing Gillooly, Shawn Eckardt ([[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]]) and their fellow conspirators as clowns, Penningroth and director Larry Shaw try for some of the [[Black comedy|dark comedy]] deployed in [[HBO]]'s Emmy-winning docu-parody ''[[The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom]]''. Instead, [this film] turns out to be just another dull movie about dull people. After squandering two hours on it, you may be asking: "Why me? Why anyone?"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7553">'''Vladimir Bodiansky''' (March 25, 1894 - December 10, 1966) was a French engineer with origins in Russia and a specialty in [[modern architecture]].

==Early life and education==
Vladamir Bodiansky began his education in 1910 at the Moscow Highway Institute.  After spending four years there, Bodianksy left with a [[civil engineering]] degree in 1914, and began building railways for the Russian Protectorate of [[Bokhara]].  Because he was enrolled as a volunteer member of the Russian Cavalry, he was sent off to fight in [[World War I]] in 1915.  He fought in Russia until three months after the [[October Revolution|October 1917 Revolution]], receiving his first degree in aviation in November 1917 from the Aviation School of Tiflis. He arrived in France in January 1918, and three months later Bodiansky joined the [[French Foreign Legion]].  As a member of the Foreign Legion, Bodiansky had many different roles in the aviation division, including as a military aviator pilot, a hydroplane pilot, a seaplane pilot, and a civil aviation pilot.  He demobilised from the French Legion on November 27, 1919, however he remained in France.  He decided to attend the [[Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology|College of Aeronautics Mechanical Construction]], receiving a diploma in 1920.  He elected to apply for [[Naturalization]] on April 11, 1927 and was naturalized on June 26, 1929.  After a three-year stint in the Congo building highways, Bodianski returned to France in 1923, where he started working with design offices and aircraft companies, specifically one owned by the [[Caudron|Caudron brothers]].  From 1925 to 1930, Bondiansky worked as a project manager for the aviation studios of [[Francois Villiers]] in [[Meudon]], where he was able to take out three patents with Villier himself.  Following Villier's death, Bodiansky started designing prototypes for a two-seater fighter plane for the French Army.

==Change in career==
Due to his work in the field of aviation, Bodiansky was able to meet Marcel Lods, an architect who shared his interest in the field.  This encounter marked a change in Bodiansky's career, as he took on the role of an engineer in the field of [[architecture]].  Through Lods, Bodiansky met Eugene Mopin, an accomplished contractor who was working on making concrete for a housing complex in [[Drancy]].  Because this was the first time that Mopin was using his experimental method of construction and Bodiansky's name was associated with it, this furthered Bodiansky's role in the field of architecture.  This continued when Bodiansky began working as the head of design in Mopin's office starting in March 1933.  He worked there until July 1937, when he was hired by Lods' agency to be a salaried engineer, where he worked until July 1940.  This marked another shift in Bodiansky's career, as he then began his career as a freelance engineer.&lt;ref name=Frapier &gt;{{cite web |last=Frapier |first=Christel |title=The career of engineer Vladimir Bodiansky |journal=Proceedings of the ICE-Engineering History and Heritage |volume=165 |issue=2 |year=2012 |pages=113-121 |accessdate= 2 November 2017|doi=10.1680/ehah.8.00017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maison du Peuple==
In 1935, a contest was held to see which architect could most efficiently design a rooftop for the open air market in Rue de Lorraine.  The contest, organized by the Mayor of [[Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine|Clichy]], gave Bodiansky the opportunity to work closely with Lods again.  The two of them, along with architect Eugène Beaudouin and metal fabricator [[Jean Prouvé]], designed a market with both a ground and upper floor, along with a 1000-seat auditorium that was capable of being transformed into a movie theatre, that came to be known as the [[Maison du Peuple]].  Both the floor and the roof were retractable.  Because this idea was innovative at the time, this helped Bodiansky solidify himself as both an engineer and an architect, as his design made the market more versatile (by providing both food and entertainment).  The Maison du Peuple is now known as one of the biggest open air markets in France.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Jimmy.

==ATBAT==
[[File:Unitè d'habitation Marseille.jpg|thumb|alt=Unitè d'habitation image|Facade of Unitè d'habitation, Marseille]]
Bodiansky met [[Le Corbusier]] during the Second World War, and together they organized a team of architects and engineers to engage in the postwar reconstruction.&lt;ref name="Emanuel2016"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Emanuel|editor-first=Muriel|last=Candilis|first=Georges|title=Contemporary Architects|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n8VyCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102|year=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-1-349-04184-8|pages=102–103|chapter=Bodiansky, Vladimir}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the formation of the Atelier des Bâtisseurs (ATBAT, builders' workshop), an interdisciplinary research group, in 1945.&lt;ref name="FCorbu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Associations professionnelles|url=http://www.fondationlecorbusier.fr/corbuweb/zcomp/pages/AtelAtba.htm|publisher=Fondation Le Corbusier|accessdate=2 November 2017|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Bodiansky accompanied Le Corbusier on a trip to the United States, where he was impressed with the interdisciplinary approach of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority|TVA]] projects. On their return to France Bodiansky took the leadership of ATBAT and reorganized it as a collaborative research center.&lt;ref name="Swenarton2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swenarton|first1=Mark|last2=Avermaete|first2=Tom|last3=Heuvel|first3=Dirk van den|title=Architecture and the Welfare State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UT-DBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT329|date=15 September 2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-66189-4|page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Over the next few years, Bodiansky as head of ATBAT collaborated with Le Corbusier on the realization of some of his best-known buildings, including the [[Unité d'habitation]] in Marseille and the [[Headquarters of the United Nations]] in New York.&lt;ref name="Emanuel2016"/&gt;

==North African housing problem==
In the late 1940s, Bodiansky oversaw the construction of houses in [[Morocco]], an area that had been plagued with too much internal migration from nearby rural areas, leading to a shortage of houses.  Bodiansky, acting on behalf of Le Corbusier, teamed up with young architects such as [[Georges Candilis]], [[Shadrach Woods]], and Henri Pilot, and created ATBAT-Afrique, a firm designed to fix the housing problems throughout Northern Africa.  The goal of the firm was to efficiently construct projects and bring engineers and architects closer together, as well as strengthen and contribute to the reconstruction effort following [[World War II]].  Bodiansky's team was able to come up with quick and innovative housing solutions, and solved the housing problem within two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Alsaden |first=Amin |title='Casbahism' in Europe: the Journey of an Architectural Idea|website=ARCC Conference Repository|date= 2013 |accessdate=30 August 2015|url=http://www.arcc-journal.org/index.php/repository/article/view/115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vladimir J. Konečni''' (born October 27, 1944&lt;ref name="VJKbio" /&gt;) is an [[United States|American]] and [[Serbia]]n psychologist, aesthetician, poet, dramatist, fiction writer, and art photographer, currently an Emeritus Professor of Psychology at the [[University of California, San Diego]].&lt;ref name="SPN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UCSD" /&gt; 

In psychology, he has carried out influential work in several distinct areas, related to each other by strong methodological concerns.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson, N. H. (2013). Unified psychology based on three laws of information integration. ''Review of General Psychology, 17'', 125-132. doi: 10.1073/a0032921&lt;/ref&gt; Konečni has conducted laboratory and field studies of human [[emotion]] and (physical and verbal) [[aggression]], as well as of [[Altruism|altruistic]] behavior, which have been cited in numerous social psychology textbooks.

[[Decision-making]] has been another major research area in which Konečni has been heavily involved (in close collaboration with Dr. Ebbe B. Ebbesen, a long-time colleague at the University of California, San Diego). Most of their work has been devoted to [[Legal psychology|judicial decisions]] in the criminal justice system, but they have also conducted a number of frequently cited studies of drivers’ decisions in real-world settings.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., Ebbesen, E. B., &amp; Konečni, D. K. (1976). Decision processes and risk taking in traffic: Driver response to the onset of yellow light. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 61'', 359-367.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ebbesen, E. B., Parker, S., &amp; Konečni, V. J. (1977). Laboratory and field analyses of decisions involving risk. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 3'', 576-589.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finally, Konečni has for some forty years worked in the multi-faceted interdisciplinary domains of [[International Association of Empirical Aesthetics|empirical aesthetics]], [[psychology of art]], and [[music psychology]]. Notable groups of his studies in these areas have addressed the highly specialized and technical problems of the “[[golden ratio]]” (or “golden section”) in visual art, the significance of [[Musical form|macrostructure in music]], peak aesthetic responses, and the relationship between [[music and emotion]].

==Biography==
Vladimir Konečni grew up in [[Belgrade]] (then the capital of Yugoslavia, now of [[Serbia]]). His parents were Dora D. Konečni (née Vasić), an economist and banker, and Josip J. Konečni, M.D., a Professor of Medicine at the University of Belgrade.

Konečni is of Serbian, Czech, and Austrian descent.&lt;ref name="VJKbio" /&gt;

Konečni is married and has two sons. He lives in San Diego (California, USA), Amsterdam (Netherlands), Tallinn (Estonia), and Belgrade (Serbia).&lt;ref name="VJKbio" /&gt;

==Career==
Konečni received his Bachelor of Arts degree in experimental and clinical psychology, and philosophy, from the University of Belgrade in 1969; as an undergraduate, he published three refereed articles.&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konecni, V. J. (1968). Psychological bases of application of the item-hierarchy procedure in behavior therapy. ''Psihološki Bilten'' (Yugoslavia), ''1'', 7-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konecni, V. J. (1969). Interaction in the clinical interview: Manipulation of certain formal variables. ''Psihologija'' (Yugoslavia), ''2'', 308-323.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konecni, V. J. (1971). Piaget’s concept of egocentrism and some related issues. ''Psihologija'' (Yugoslavia), ''4'', 197-210.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1970, he began graduate studies in experimental and social psychology at the University of Toronto, Canada, receiving an M.A. degree in 1971 and a Ph.D. in 1973. The title of his dissertation was “Experimental Studies of Human Aggression: The Cathartic Effect.”&lt;ref name="dissert"&gt;[http://search.library.utoronto.ca/details?2951077&amp;uuid=8734e28e-309f-483f-bc7f-2fff03b3d489 University of Toronto Library Catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK3"&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1975). Annoyance, type and duration of postannoyance activity, and aggression: The “cathartic effect”. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 104'', 76-102.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1973, Konečni was appointed Assistant Professor and thus began his 35-year-long uninterrupted association with the Department of Psychology at the University of California, San Diego (Associate Professor in 1978; Professor in 1982; Emeritus Professor in 2008).

In the period after 1973, he was at various times a Visiting Professor at a number of renowned universities outside the United States, including the London School of Economics, Sydney University, Hebrew University Jerusalem, University of Cape Town, Universiteit van Amsterdam, and Freie Universität Berlin.&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt; In the course of his career so far, Konečni has given colloquia on his research at some 150 universities on all continents.&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt;

===Negative Emotions, Physiological Arousal, and Aggressive Behavior===
In the period 1972-1984, Konečni carried out, in parallel, field experiments on [[Altruism|altruistic]] behavior,&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1972). Some effects of guilt on compliance: A field replication. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 23'', 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., Libuser, L., Morton, H., &amp; Ebbesen, E.

''Science, 194'', 562.&lt;/ref&gt; and laboratory and field studies on human physical and verbal [[aggression]].&lt;ref name="VJK3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK1"&gt;Konečni, V. J., &amp; Doob, A. N. (1972). Catharsis through displacement of aggression. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 23'', 379-387.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK2"&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1974).

Austin &amp; S. Worchel (Eds.), ''The social psychology of intergroup relations'' (pp. 85-102). Monterey, CA: Brooks/Cole.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK10"&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2013).

''Psihologija u Svetu, 7'', 29-45.&lt;/ref&gt; 

With regard to aggression, on the basis of experimental findings, Konečni distinguished among physical, verbal, play, fantasy and other types of aggression, and proposed the existence of bidirectional causation (behavioral and psychophysiological) between the degree of anger (high arousal antagonistically labeled) and the amount of expressed physical aggression.&lt;ref name="VJK1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK6" /&gt; 

This theoretical model, which emphasized previously unacknowledged feedback loops, seems to resolve the classical issue of “catharsis.” By means of definitional clarity and experimental precision, the model shifts the debate to the many implications of the theoretically sound and empirically observable “cathartic effect,”&lt;ref name="VJK3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baron, R.A. (1977). ''Human aggression''. New York, NY: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, R. M., Konečni, V. J., &amp; Novaco, R. W. (Eds.). (1984). ''Aggression in children and youth''. The Hague, The Netherlands: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; replacing unfocused appeals to sources as diverse as [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Aristotle’s ''Poetics'']], [[Melanie Klein|Kleinian]] play therapy, and Albert Bandura’s social learning theory.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1973). ''Aggression: A social learning analysis''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; This Anger-Aggression Bidirectional-Causation (AABC&lt;ref name="VJK10" /&gt;) theoretical model parsimoniously accounts for hundreds of experimental findings in the literature.&lt;ref name="VJK8" /&gt; These ideas have also been applied to the role of aversive events in the development of intergroup conflict.&lt;ref name="VJK9" /&gt; Subsequently, Konečni's writing on aggression was extended to the concept of revenge&lt;ref name="VJK10" /&gt; and the expression of anger and violence on the stage.&lt;ref name="VJK11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK12" /&gt;

===Legal Psychology and Judicial Decision-Making===
From 1973 to 2011 (the year of Emeritus Professor Ebbe B. Ebbesen’s passing), Ebbesen and Konečni worked on judicial decision-making in the criminal justice system. Using quantitative methods, they studied how various participants in the system – judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, police officers, perpetrators, and others – combine the information available to them into decisions that then become information items for other decision-makers in the system. 

This work has been very influential&lt;ref&gt;Lösel, F., Bender, D., &amp; Bliesener, T. (Eds.). (1992). ''Psychology and law: International perspectives''. Berlin, Germany: Walter de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wrightsman, L. S., Nietzel, M. T., &amp; Fortune, W. H. (1994). ''Psychology and the legal system'' (3rd ed.). Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lovegrove, A. (1997). ''The framework of judicial sentencing: A study in legal decision making''. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kapardis, A. (2003). ''Psychology and law: A critical introduction'' (2nd ed.). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described as “arduous” and “pioneering.”&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; 

One of its major features has been the comparison of data from experimental simulations to those obtained from archival records and court hearings, often involving the same participants or the same classes of participants (even Superior Court judges participated in the simulations). After their much-cited first article, in 1975, comparing judges’ bail-setting decisions in a simulation to those they made in the courtroom,&lt;ref&gt;Ebbesen, E. B., &amp; Konečni, V. J. (1975). Decision making and information integration in the courts: The setting of bail. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 32'', 805-821.&lt;/ref&gt; Ebbesen and Konečni published a number of critical methodological articles on the key issue of ''external validity'' at many points in the existing research on the legal process, with special reference to jury simulations.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., &amp; Ebbesen, E. B. (1979). External validity of research in legal psychology. ''Law and Human Behavior, 3'', 39-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ebbesen, E. B., &amp; Konečni, V. J. (1980).

In B. D. Sales (Ed.), ''The trial process'' (Vol. 2, pp. 481-498). Perspectives in law and psychology. New York, NY: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., &amp; Ebbesen, E. B. (1984).

Criticisms of the criminal justice system: A decision-making analysis. ''Behavioral Sciences &amp; the Law, 3'', 177-194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., &amp; Ebbesen, E. B. (1992).

[Methodological issues in research on legal decision-making, with special reference to experimental simulations]. ''Gruppendynamik, 2'', 175-188.&lt;/ref&gt; This led both to resistance&lt;ref&gt;King, M. (1986). ''Psychology in and out of court: A critical examination of legal psychology''. Oxford, England: Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and critiques of the resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, A. S. (1988). A critique of legal psychology. ''Contemporary Psychology, 33'', 586-588.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1982, Konečni and Ebbesen edited a book (dedicated to [[Egon Brunswik]] and [[Kurt Lewin]]), ''The Criminal Justice System: A Social-Psychological Analysis'', to which they contributed five chapters that outlined their theoretical and methodological viewpoint and addressed several major empirical issues.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., &amp; Ebbesen, E. B. (Eds.). (1982). ''The criminal justice system: A social-psychological analysis''. San Francisco, CA: W. H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the chapters presented the results of a large project (over one thousand cases) on judicial sentencing for felonies in California; among other findings, it included a causal analysis that eliminated several popular views of sentencing and highlighted the decisive role of probation officers.&lt;ref&gt;Ebbesen, E. B., &amp; Konečni, V. J. (1981). The process of sentencing adult felons: A causal analysis of judicial decisions. In B. D. Sales (Ed.), ''The trial process'' (Vol. 2, pp. 413-458).

Ebbesen (Eds.), ''The criminal justice system: A social-psychological analysis'' (pp. 293-332). San Francisco, CA: W. H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Konečni and Ebbesen, with several students, also conducted empirical investigations of “mentally disordered sex offenders,” child-custody decisions, and other issues of societal importance.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., Mulcahy, E. M., &amp; Ebbesen, E. B. (1980). Prison or mental hospital: Factors affecting the processing of persons suspected of being “mentally disordered sex offenders”. In P. D. Lipsitt &amp; B. D. Sales (Eds.), ''New directions in psycholegal research'' (pp. 87-124). New York, NY: Van Nostrand Reinhold.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kunin, C. C., Ebbesen, E. B., &amp; Konečni, V. J. (1992). An archival study of decision-making in child custody disputes. ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 48'', 564-573.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., &amp; Ebbesen, E. B. (1986). Courtroom testimony by psychologists on eyewitness identification issues: Critical notes and reflections. ''Law and Human Behavior, 10'', 117-126.&lt;/ref&gt; 

They also published extensive critiques of what they believed were mistaken, yet entrenched, views on another major issue in legal psychology, namely, the probative value of prior eyewitness memory research in general,&lt;ref&gt;Ebbesen, E. B., &amp; Konečni, V. J. (1997). Eyewitness memory research: Probative v. prejudicial value. ''Expert Evidence, 5'', 2-28.&lt;/ref&gt; and, specifically, the probative value of psychologists’ testimony on eyewitness issues in the cases of exonerations by DNA evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., Ebbesen, E. B., &amp; Nehrer, E. (2000). Retrospective implications for the probative value of psychologists’ testimony on eyewitness issues of exonerations by DNA evidence. In A. Czerederecka, T. Jaskiewicz-Obydzinska &amp; J. Wojcikiewicz (Eds.), ''Forensic psychology and law: Traditional questions and new ideas'' (pp. 41-45). Krakow, Poland: Institute of Forensic Research.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finally, while working in Konečni’s laboratory, G. Kette, an Austrian psychologist, coauthored two articles with Konečni on communication channels and the decoding and integration of cues in judicial decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Kette, G., &amp; Konečni, V. J. (1996). Communication channels and gender differences in decoding and integration of cues in legal decision-making. In G. Davies, S. Lloyd-Bostock, M. McMurran &amp; C. Wilson (Eds.) ''Psychology, law, and criminal justice: International developments in research and practice'' (pp. 314-326). Berlin, Germany: Walter de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kette, G., &amp;  Konečni, V. J. (1996). Geschlechtsspezifisches Dekodieren und Integrieren nonverbaler Information in der richterlichen Urteilsfindung. [Gender-specific decoding and integration of nonverbal information in judicial judgements]. ''Gruppendynamik, 3'', 309-328.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empirical Aesthetics===
Throughout his career, Vladimir Konečni has conducted numerous experiments in diverse areas of [[International Association of Empirical Aesthetics|empirical aesthetics]] – a field dominated by scientifically oriented psychologists and thus often referred to as psychological or (psycho-) aesthetics (distinct from “[[aesthetics]],” which usually refers to philosophical aesthetics).&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2005). On philosophical and empirical aesthetics. In A. Šļahova (Ed.), ''Proceedings of the 4th International Conference Person-Color-Nature-Music'' (pp. 46-55). Daugavpils, Latvia: Saule.&lt;/ref&gt; In his first article (1976) in psycho-aesthetics, Konečni, influenced by [[Daniel Berlyne]] (one of his graduate-school mentors&lt;ref name="VJKbio" /&gt;), successfully combined work on physiological arousal with his own prior work on the “cathartic effect” to study music preference (as a dependent variable).&lt;ref name="VJK6" /&gt; A broad and innovative empirical approach to the study of emotional, mood, and personality antecedents of aesthetic preference and choice in both visual art and music resulted in a number of publications with several American and European graduate students and in various languages.&lt;ref name="VJK13"&gt;Konečni, V. J., &amp; Sargent-Pollock, D. (1976). Choice between melodies differing in complexity under divided-attention conditions. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 2'', 347-356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., &amp; Sargent-Pollock, D. (1977). Arousal, positive and negative affect, and preference for Renaissance and 20th-Century paintings. ''Motivation and Emotion, 1'', 75-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sargent-Pollock, D. N., &amp; Konečni, V.

''Music Perception, 2'', 459-470.&lt;/ref&gt; Konečni also wrote two widely cited theoretical articles that addressed (a) the social, emotional, and cognitive determinants of aesthetic preference and (b) the measurable psychological consequences of exposure to aesthetic stimuli,&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1979). Determinants of aesthetic preference and effects of exposure to aesthetic stimuli: Social, emotional and cognitive factors. In B. A. Maher (Ed.), ''Progress in experimental personality research'' (Vol. 9, pp. 149-197). New York, NY: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK16"&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1982). Social interaction and musical preference. In D. Deutsch (Ed.), ''The psychology of music'' (pp. 497-516). New York, NY: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in his formulation of the “Model of Aesthetic Episode” (MAE), which he continued to refine over many years.&lt;ref name="VJK17"&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2013). Empirical psycho-aesthetics and her sisters: Substantive and methodological issues (Part 2). ''Journal of Aesthetic Education, 47'', 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Visual Art====
Various problems in the area of visual art have been frequently and to this day investigated by Konečni. There have been articles, inspired by MAE, on the interactive effects of visual art and music on emotion and mood,&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1994). Interactive effects of music and visual art. In I. Deliège (Ed.), ''Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference for Music Perception and Cognition'' (pp. 23-24). Liège, Belgium: Université de Liège.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1995). Interactive effects of music and visual art in different emotional states. In I. Gorlova, V. M. Petrov &amp; Yu. Rags (Eds.), ''Proceedings of the International Conference on The Human in the World of Art: Informational Aspects'' (pp. 126-133). Moscow, Russia.&lt;/ref&gt; culminating recently (2010, 2015) in two theoretical articles.&lt;ref name="VJK18"&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2010). The influence of affect on music choice. In P. N. Juslin &amp; J. A. Sloboda (Eds.), ''Handbook of music and emotion: Theory, research, applications'' (pp. 697-723). Oxford, England: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK19"&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2015). Emotion in painting and art installations. ''American Journal of Psychology, 128'', 305-322.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he is one of very few psychoaestheticians who has been able to study the creative process ''in vivo'' – in his experimental study of portraiture.&lt;ref name="VJK17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1991). Portraiture: An experimental study of the creative process. ''Leonardo, 24'', 325-328.&lt;/ref&gt; Konečni has also written about the politics and social ecology of architecture – specifically in Stalin’s Soviet Union and Hitler’s Germany – and he has recently addressed the aesthetic and social issues regarding new museums in China.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1996). Politika i social'naya ekologiya arkhitektur'i. [Politics and the social ecology of architecture]. ''Kul'turologicheskie Zapiski, 2'', 175-189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2015). Two extraordinary new museums in south-eastern China. ''Art and Design Review, 3'', 76-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The “Golden Ratio”====
For about ten years (1995-2005), Konečni did a great deal of experimental and theoretical work on the “[[golden ratio]]” (or “golden section”).&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1997). The vase on the mantelpiece: The golden section in context. ''Empirical Studies of the Arts, 15'', 177-207.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2001).

On the “golden section” (Chinese Trans. by Geng Yan). ''Art and Science, 2'', 154-160.&lt;/ref&gt; He has repeatedly emphasized the need for distinguishing among the numerous facets of this classical problem in aesthetics and art: Objects in nature vs. objects in art and architecture; the known presence vs. absence of artist’s intention in utilizing the ratio; the degree of perceivers’ awareness of the ratio in an object and the influence of that awareness, if any, on the object’s aesthetic appeal. In his work on paintings, Konečni used many different measures, including the dimensions of the rectangle (frame); the vertical and horizontal bisections of a painting; and the dimensions of significant depicted objects within the painting. He considered the analysis of this variety of measures indispensable and developed several methodological innovations, as well as refinements of the classical [[Gustav Fechner|Fechnerian]] ones. Konečni has described the golden ratio as “elusive but detectable,”&lt;ref name="VJK20" /&gt; and more likely to influence the results of carefully conducted experiments as part of higher-order interactions than as a main effect; its “contextuality and configurality” make it, he has suggested, comparable to concepts in Zen aesthetics.&lt;ref name="VJK21" /&gt;

====Neuroaesthetics====
This new, 21st century, area of research has been considered a branch of empirical aesthetics. Konečni has described its main characteristics, and has critically analyzed some of the claims made by several prominent practitioners, arguing that these claims are exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2012). Empirical psycho-aesthetics and her sisters: Substantive and methodological issues (Part 1). ''Journal of Aesthetic Education, 46'', 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2012). Empirical psycho-aesthetics and her sisters: Substantive and methodological issues. In F. Dorsch &amp; D.-E. Ratiu (Eds.), ''Proceedings of the European Society for Aesthetics, 4'', 271-315.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2015). Reflections on psychological and neuroaesthetics. ''Theoria, 58'', 5-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music Psychology===
Konečni has been heavily involved in many aspects of music psychology. In addition to the experimental and theoretical articles on the effects of a variety of factors (including high arousal and other forms of stress) on music preference and choice (for example, among melodies differing in complexity),&lt;ref name="VJK13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK16" /&gt; he developed a new methodology to investigate the theoretically interesting question of “hedonic effects of development vs. chance in resolved and unresolved aural episodes.”&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1999). Expression and meaning in Tasol: Hedonic effects of development vs. chance in resolved and unresolved aural episodes. ''Musikpsychologie, 14'', 102-123.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he contributed to topics of interest to musicians, such as a two-part article that presented a psychological analysis of J. S. Bach’s ''St. Matthew Passion'',&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1986, July). Bach's St. Matthew Passion: A rudimentary psychological analysis (Part 1). ''BACH, 17'', 10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1986, October). Bach's St. Matthew Passion: A rudimentary psychological analysis (Part 2). ''BACH, 17'', 3-16.&lt;/ref&gt; and another on mode and tempo in Western classical music of the common-practice era.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2009). Mode and tempo in Western classical music of the common-practice era: My grandmother was largely right – but no one knows why. ''Empirical Musicology Review, 4'', 23-26.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Konečni wrote about the (Latin) ''Requiem'' by the Russian composer Vyacheslav Artyomov and about the playing style of the Canadian pianist Glenn Gould.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1997, October–November). Rekviem Vyacheslava Artyomova: Proizvedenie gumanista? [Vyacheslav Artyomov's Requiem: A humanist document?]. ''In the concert program for the performances of the Requiem at the Moscow Conservatory Great Hall'' (pp. 11-16). Moscow, Russia: Fond Duchovnogo Tvorchestva.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1991) [Review of the book ''Glenn Gould, a life and variations'' by O. Friedrich]. ''Musik Psychologie, 8'', 148-153.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also his three contributions to ''Music in the Social and Behavioral Sciences: An Encyclopedia'' by SAGE&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2014). Emotions, aesthetic. In W. F. Thompson (Ed.), ''Music in the social and behavioral sciences: An encyclopedia'' (Vol. 1, pp. 382-385). London, England: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J.

(2014). Music research, causal effects. In W. F. Thompson (Ed.), ''Music in the social and behavioral sciences: An encyclopedia'' (Vol. 2, pp. 756-761). London, England: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt; and a highly technical review of Steven Jan’s book ''The Memetics of Music: A Neo-Darwinian View of Musical Structure and Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2008). [Review of the book ''The memetics of music: A neo-Darwinian view of musical structure and culture'' by S. Jan]. ''British Journal of Aesthetics, 48'', 463-465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan, S. B. (2007). ''The memetics of music: A neo-Darwinian view of musical structure and culture''. Aldershot, England: Ashgate.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Macrostructure in Music====
In 1984, Konečni published an article with five experiments on the “elusive effects of artists’ ‘messages,’”&lt;ref name="VJK17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1984). Elusive effects of artists’ “messages”. In W. R. Crozier &amp; A. J. Chapman (Eds.), ''Cognitive processes in the perception of art'' (pp. 71-93). Amsterdam, The Netherlands: North Holland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crozier, W. A., &amp; Chapman, A. J. (Eds.). (1984). ''Cognitive processes in the perception of art''. Amsterdam, The Netherlands: North Holland.&lt;/ref&gt; in which “messages” were defined broadly to include, in the two experiments devoted to music, the [[Musical form|macrostructure of the pieces]], such as the original ordering of the movements in [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven’s]] piano sonatas and string quartets. Surprisingly, and contrary to strongly held musicological conventions, even drastic reordering of the movements produced negligible decrements in listeners’ enjoyment. Follow-up experiments produced analogous results; a variety of highly esteemed and diverse music pieces were used as research stimuli in this work, including [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach’s]] ''Goldberg Variations'' (diverse ordering of the variations) and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart’s]] ''Symphony in G-Minor'', K. 550 (reordering of the key structural parts of the first movement).&lt;ref&gt;Gotlieb, H., &amp; Konečni, V. J. (1985). The effects of instrumentation, playing style, and structure in the Goldberg Variations by Johann Sebastian Bach.

The effects of structural interventions in the First Movement of Mozart's Symphony in G-Minor K. 550 on aesthetic preference. ''Music Perception, 10'', 63-72.&lt;/ref&gt; These and related experiments were further discussed by Konečni and Karno in 1994, at which time they also summarized the previous debate with musicologists Robert Batt and [[Nicholas Cook]] about this research.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., &amp; Karno, M. (1994). Empirical investigations of the hedonic and emotional effects of musical structure. ''Musik Psychologie, 11'', 119-137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1987).

====Music and Emotion====
Konečni has been very active in this area since about 2002. There have been reports of laboratory experiments,&lt;ref name="VJK22"&gt;Konečni, V. J., Wanic, R. A., &amp; Brown, A. (2007).

''American Journal of Psychology, 126'', 179-195.&lt;/ref&gt; and detailed reviews of important books in music-psychology and philosophical-aesthetics journals.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2003). [Review of the book ''Music and emotion: Theory and research'' by P. N. Juslin &amp; J. A. Sloboda (Eds.)]. ''Music Perception, 20'', 332– 341.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2003).

[Review of the book ''The emotional power of music: Multidisiplinary perspectives on musical arousal, expression, and social control'' by T. Cochrane, F. Bernardino &amp; K. R. Scherer (Eds.)]. ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, 73'', 214-218.&lt;/ref&gt; Konečni has taken a strong and elaborate – albeit minority – stance against what he regards is an avalanche of insufficiently substantiated claims regarding the relationship between music and emotion, and specifically against the thesis that music ''causes'' emotion. In a recent book review, he wrote: “The authors never clearly state something very simple and almost certainly true: ''some'' music ''may'', ''sometimes'', in ''some'' people, under ''some'' circumstances, elicit ''some'' psychobiological emotions, but never nearly as powerful as the correspondent emotions in social life.”&lt;ref name="VJK29" /&gt; Konečni has based this view on a careful examination of the literature in both music psychology and philosophical aesthetics; on the Prototypical Emotion-Episode Model (PEEM, which he had developed over many years);&lt;ref name="VJK24" /&gt; on his own experimental findings and theoretical work regarding music and emotion;&lt;ref name="VJK18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK23" /&gt; and on what he perceives as widespread neglect of definitional precision and sound methodology in this multidisciplinary field, including in numerous highly cited research articles.&lt;ref name="VJK18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK24" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK27" /&gt;

====Anti-“Emotivism”====
Konečni has written that there is ample evidence to view the majority position about the relationship between music and emotion as an aspect of the socio-culturally prevalent “emotivism,”&lt;ref name="VJK25" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK26" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK28" /&gt; which he distinguished from [[emotivism]] in ethics, and defined as “the propensity for excessive insertion of emotion and ‘feeling’ into both lay and scientific theories of mental life, motives, needs, and daily behavior, in matters artistic and non-artistic.”&lt;ref name="VJK25" /&gt; He has suggested that the proclivity for emotional and quasi-emotional excess is related to the prevalent anti-narrative social climate, which often ignores evidence and reason.

Konečni recently published a theoretical article on emotion in the domain of painting and art installations&lt;ref name="VJK19" /&gt; and discussed emotivism in this context also.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2013). A critique of emotivism in aesthetic accounts of visual art. ''Philosophy Today, 57'', 388-400.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2014). Paintings and emotion: A nonemotivist reevaluation [CD, pp. 34-39]. ''Proceedings of the 23rd biennial congress of the International Association of Empirical Aesthetics''. New York, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peak Aesthetic Experiences===
This issue is one in which philosophical aesthetics and psycho-aesthetics are intertwined – in general and in Konečni’s extensive work in the past decade. In 2005, he published a theoretical article outlining his “aesthetic trinity theory” (ATT),&lt;ref name="VJK30"&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2005). The aesthetic trinity: Awe, being moved, thrills. ''Bulletin of Psychology and the Arts, 5'', 27-44.&lt;/ref&gt; in which “trinity” refers to a tripartite hierarchical organization of peak aesthetic responses&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2005). Ancient and contemporary aesthetic “emotions”. ''Proceedings of the Wuhan University Aesthetics Conference Beauty and the way of modern life'' (pp. 351-367). Wuhan, China: Wuhan University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2006). Ancient and contemporary aesthetic “emotions” (Chinese Trans. by Yang Yi &amp; Deng Yang-zhou). ''Philosophic Inquiry, 5'', 56-76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2007). The aesthetic trinity: Awe, being moved, thrills (Chinese Trans. by Deng Yang-zhou). ''Art and Science, 4'', 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2010). Aesthetic trinity theory and the sublime. In A. Bertinetto, F. Dorsch &amp; C. Todd (Eds.), ''Proceedings of the European Society for Aesthetics'' (Vol. 2, pp. 244-264). Udine, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK31"&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2011). Aesthetic trinity theory and the sublime. ''Philosophy Today, 55'', 64-73.&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of: (a) physiological thrills (or chills),&lt;ref name="VJK22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK30" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK31" /&gt; the most frequent and transient response, and the least pronounced, yet the object of most experimental work; (b) the state of “being moved,” considered to be intermediate in depth and duration&lt;ref name="VJK30" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK31" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2015). Being moved as one of the major aesthetic emotional states: A commentary on “Being moved: Linguistic representation and conceptual structure”. ''Frontiers in Psychology: Emotion Science, 6''(343). doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00343&lt;/ref&gt; (the linguistic representation and conceptual structure of this state have recently been empirically investigated by Kuehnast et al., 2014&lt;ref&gt;Kuehnast, M., Wagner, V., Wassiliwizky, E., Jacobsen, T., &amp; Menninghaus, W. (2014). Being moved: Linguistic representation and conceptual structure. ''Frontiers in Psychology, 5''(1242). doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01242&lt;/ref&gt;); and (c) aesthetic awe,&lt;ref name="VJK19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK30" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK31" /&gt; conceptualized as the peak aesthetic response, exceedingly rare and memorable, and similar to the fundamental emotions in terms of physiological fluctuation, but, unlike them, characterized by existential safety, controllability of danger, and the ease with which it can be “switched off.” In ATT, aesthetic awe is viewed as the prototypical response to the “sublime stimulus-in-context” that is external to the perceiver (unlike some positions in philosophy), defined independently of aesthetic awe, and characterized by physical grandeur, great rarity, extraordinary beauty, and novelty, among other criteria). Many aspects of ATT are testable and the results would speak to both philosophical and psychological aestheticians.&lt;ref name="VJK30" /&gt;

===Work in Literature and the Arts===
Vladimir Konečni has for a long time been a prolific poet, dramatist, short-story writer, and art photographer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pickedrawpeeled.blogspot.com/2013/09/a-conversation-with-vladimir-konecni.html  “A conversation with Vladimir Konečni about art, aesthetics and critics.”]&lt;/ref&gt; He has published literary works in English, French, and Serbian. His plays have been performed in a number of countries in North America and Europe, under his direction on two occasions.&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt; In addition, he participated in many group art-photography shows in California, and had solo exhibitions in U.S.A. and Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalartguild.com/content/view/73/  “San Diego to Belgrade”]&lt;/ref&gt; Konečni’s work in all of these areas can be accessed gratis at his website.
