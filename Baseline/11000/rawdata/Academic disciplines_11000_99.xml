'''The Alliance of Independent Academic Medical Centers (AIAMC)''' is an American national membership organization of approximately 70 major [[Academic health science centre|academic medical centers]] and health systems committed to quality [[patient care]], [[medical education]] and [[research]].  AIAMC members regard medical education and research as strategic assets in providing [[patient-centered care]]; operate independently of [[medical school]] ownership or governance while maintaining major medical school affiliations; care for a patient population that mirrors their local communities; and provide teaching and research that is innovative, applicable to practice and community responsive.

==History ==
The AIAMC was formed in 1989 to provide a forum for those institutions whose governance and academic leadership were distinct from that of their associated medical schools.  Since that time, the organization’s prestige and influence have grown progressively.&lt;ref&gt;Medical Meetings. [http://meetingsnet.com/medicalmeetings/news/3-ways-aiamc-changed-up-its-annual-conference-0419/.] "3 Ways AIAMC Changed Up Its Annual Conference."&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is considered a national resource, with Alliance members participating in leadership and governance roles in key groups as the [[Association of American Medical Colleges|AAMC]], [[Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education|ACCME]], [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education|ACGME]], [[American Hospital Association|AHA]], [[American Medical Association|AMA]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;AIAMC. [http://www.aiamc.org/history.php AIAMC History.] "AIAMC."&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Initiative to Improve Patient Care through Graduate Medical Education ==
===National Initiative I===
In early 2007, the Alliance of Independent Academic Medical Centers (AIAMC) launched Improving Patient Care through Graduate Medical Education: A National Initiative of Independent Academic Medical Centers. Nineteen AIAMC-member institutions participated in this charter effort. The National Initiative (NI) featured five meetings over the course of 18 months which served as touchstones for ongoing quality improvement in AIAMC participating organizations. These meetings, as well as the monthly collaborative calls held in-between, provided structure, discussion and networking opportunities around specific quality improvement initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;ACGME. [http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/bulletin/bulletin11_07.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928070626/http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/bulletin/bulletin11_07.pdf |date=2011-09-28 }} ''ACGME Bulletin.'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This 18-month "NI-I" was supported by a grant from the foundation of [[HealthPartners Institute for Medical Education]], an AIAMC member institution located in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;AIAMC. [http://www.aiamc.org/ni-overview.php National Initiative Overview.] ''AIAMC.''&lt;/ref&gt; The effort was led by Carl Patow, MD, Executive Director of HealthPartners Institute for Medical Education. 

As a result of these efforts, AIAMC has initial findings that demonstrate the efficacy of integrating GME into patient safety and quality improvement initiatives. These findings have been organized into a series of articles that were published in the December 2009 issue of Academic Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1749–56 |doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181bf686f |title=Integrating Quality Improvement and Residency Education: Insights from the AIAMC National Initiative About the Roles of the Designated Institutional Official and Program Director |year=2009 |last1=Jenson |first1=Hal B. |last2=Dorner |first2=Douglas |last3=Hinchey |first3=Kevin |last4=Ankel |first4=Felix |last5=Goldman |first5=Stuart |last6=Patow |first6=Carl |journal=Academic Medicine |volume=84 |issue=12 |pmid=19940584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Initiative II===
In 2009, AIAMC launched the second National Initiative and expanded participation to 35 AIAMC-member teaching hospitals from Seattle to Maine.  Each participating hospital developed a quality improvement team led by a resident or faculty member, and included their respective quality improvement leader. These teams met four times and participated in monthly conference calls over an 18-month period. Quality improvement projects focused on the following areas: Communication, Hand Offs, Infection Control, Readmissions and Transitions of Care. The objectives of this second phase were: 
* to align and integrate academic programs with quality initiatives to accelerate the efforts of quality and patient safety;
* assist residency program directors and house staff in the teaching, learning and assessment of the core competencies focused on Practice-Based Learning and Systems Based Practice;
* inform hospital and policy leaders about the contributions that can be made by faculty and house staff in expediting patient safety; and
* integrate house staff into multidisciplinary team-based safety initiatives as a national priority.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Harris. [https://www.aamc.org/newsroom/reporter/feb11/174758/residents_quality_improvement.html] "Residents Help Drive Quality Improvement". 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Initiative III===
National Initiative III launched in the fall of 2011, and will directly address the ACGME Common Program Requirements for Professionalism, Personal Responsibility and Patient Safety by educating program directors, faculty members and residents in a train-the-trainer approach. The structure and content of NI III will also meet directives for Teamwork by providing training in effective communication as part of inter-professional teams. The structure of the National Initiative III will resemble the previous two initiatives, with quarterly meetings for quality improvement didactics and leadership training, conference calls to assess progress, and local hospital team initiatives to improve patient care.

===National Initiative IV===
The fourth National Initiative recognized the importance of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education initiative entitled the "Clinical Learning Environment Review".  Teams from over 35 teaching hospitals across the United States participated in a two year learning collaborative to improve performance in six focus areas: patient safety, quality imrpvoement, transitions of care, supervision, fatigue management and professionalism. 

===National Initiative V===
National Initiative V began in 2015, and focused on the role of teaching hospitals' response to health care disparities. Findings from the National Initiatives are published in the Oschner Journal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4716">'''Antilocution''' is a form of [[prejudice]] in which [[Affirmative and negative|negative]] [[Speech|verbal]] remarks against a [[person]], group, or community, are made in a [[public]] or private setting and not addressed directly to the target. American psychologist [[Gordon Allport]] first used this term in his 1954 book, ''The Nature of Prejudice''''',''' to label the first of the five degrees of [[antipathy]] that measure manifestation of prejudice in a society as antilocution (see also: "[[Allport's Scale]]"). Antilocution is similar to the rather common form of [[betrayal]] in which a person "talks behind someone's back.", but antilocution involves an in-group [[ostracism|ostracizing]] an out-group on a [[bias]]ed basis.

The use of the term antilocution is overshadowed by the term [[hate speech]], which holds a similar meaning but places no regard on the fact that the out-group is unaware of the [[discrimination]].

==Etymology==

The term antilocution first appeared in 1954 in "The Nature of Prejudice", a book written by an American psychologist "Gordon Allport". Antilocution is the first stage of Allport's scale, a scale to measure the degree of bias or prejudice in one's [[society]]. Following antilocution, the greater stages of prejudice are [[Avoidance coping|avoidance]], [[discrimination]], [[physical abuse|physical attack]], and [[Genocide|extermination]] respectively. Antilocution is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] noun which consists of the word locution and the word anti, to express a counterproductive way to employ locution.

==Description==
Antilocution is considered the least aggressive form of prejudice and represented by [[conversations]] of individuals in a society sharing similar opinions, which often are biased and result in negative reputation of the target of antilocution. Although this form of prejudice maybe the least aggressive, it nevertheless can be very destructive and life-changing for the subject. Those who employ antilocution may not be aware or consider themselves as involved in any discriminatory act.  Antilocution is perhaps the most common form of discriminative act, and is more commonly referred as minor [[gossips]] or [[scandals]]. The subject may feel the need to join in with the flow or comedize it if the antilocution is employed by the [[majority]]. This can either create a place for the subject in the pack or lead to a spread of biased [[information]] through the society and can lead to negative modification in [[behaviors]] toward the subject, thus will significantly put the subject in a [[disadvantaged]] way both socially and mentally.

==Causes, employment, and danger==
Individuals often engage in prejudicial conversation when they feel threatened and frequently is based on misperceptions and stereotyping of the subject. Antilocution often related to the fact that the subject is viewed as an anomaly to the group, for example the subject maybe a newcoming member thus no one actually know the subject so they judge the subject based on their perceptions and stereotyping, often involve [[racism]], [[ethnic]], or [[gender]]. Most individuals engaged in this type of behavior will most likely deny that their behavior is prejudicial in any way, and often indicate this as a matter of expressing their own [[opinions]]. This kind of treatment to antilocution is very dangerous in its own as it leads to a widespread in discriminative acts toward the subject as individuals feel little to no [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] in doing so. Facts are often needed to [[contradict]] [[misinformation]] and create a positive [[Social influence|influence]] in the society toward the subject, or else opinions will continue to multiply and lead to further misconceptions, which can eventually lead to more serious forms of prejudice and discrimination and will harm the subject socially, mentally, and even physically if the problem worsen to a certain degree.

'''Arachnoid''' as a descriptive term in botany, refers to organs such as leaves or stems that have a cobwebby exterior appearance, from being covered with fine white hairs, usually tangled. Such material is one common cause of plants having a grey or white appearance.&lt;ref name= "BotGloss"&gt;Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, 4th ed 1928&lt;/ref&gt; The usages of various authors in distinguishing between "arachnoid" and a few other terms referring to [[leaf#Hairiness|hairiness]], such as [[Glossary of botanical terms|floccose]], [[Glossary of botanical terms|pubescent]], [[Glossary of botanical terms|tomentum]], cottony, or [[Glossary of botanical terms|villous]], tend to be arbitrary, but as a rule the term is best reserved for hairiness lighter than a [[felted]] layer, and inclined to rub off or to be easily damaged in other ways. The arachnoid appearance is common on the leaves and stems of various sclerophyllous members of the [[Asteraceae]], such as some [[thistle]]s.

Nonetheless, "cobwebbiness" is a subjective impression, and in the likes of ''Hayworthia arachnoidea'' the arachnoid impression arises from the thicket of [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spinescent leaf denticles]] that are not at all fine, tangled, or fragile. In the cactus ''[[Cephalocereus senilis]]'', the arachnoid effect arises from long-lasting hairy spines.

In many cases [[Astronomy|astronomical phenomena]] viewed from the planet [[Mars]] are the same or similar to those seen from [[Earth]] but sometimes (as with the view of Earth as an evening/morning star) they can be quite different. For example, because the [[atmosphere of Mars]] does not contain an [[ozone layer]], it is also possible to make [[UV astronomy|UV observation]]s from the surface of Mars.

==Seasons==
{{See also|Climate of Mars|Timekeeping on Mars}}

Mars has an [[axial tilt]] of 25.19°, quite close to the value of 23.44° for [[Earth]], and thus Mars has seasons of spring, summer, autumn, winter as Earth does. As on Earth, the southern and northern hemispheres have summer and winter at opposing times.

However, the orbit of Mars has significantly greater [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] than that of Earth. Therefore, the seasons are of unequal length, much more so than on Earth:

{| class="wikitable"
!Season !! Sols&lt;br /&gt;(on Mars) !! Days&lt;br /&gt;(on Earth)
|-
| Northern spring, southern autumn: || 193.30 || 92.764
|-
| Northern summer, southern winter: || 178.64 || 93.647
|-
| Northern autumn, southern spring: || 142.70 || 89.836
|-
| Northern winter, southern summer: || 153.95 || 88.997
|}

In practical terms, this means that summers and winters have different lengths and intensities in the northern and southern [[Hemispheres of Earth|hemispheres]]. Winters in the north are warm and short (because Mars is moving fast near its [[perihelion]]), while winters in the south are long and cold (Mars is moving slowly near [[aphelion]]). Similarly, summers in the north are long and cool, while summers in the south are short and hot. Therefore, extremes of temperature are considerably wider in the southern hemisphere than in the north.

The [[seasonal lag]] on Mars is no more than a couple of days,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pds-atmospheres.nmsu.edu/education_and_outreach/encyclopedia/radiative_time_constant.htm radiative time constant&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; due to its lack of large bodies of water and similar factors that would provide a buffering effect. Thus, for temperatures on Mars, "spring" is approximately the mirror image of "summer" and "autumn" is approximately the mirror image of "winter" (if you consider the solstices and equinoxes to be the beginnings of their respective seasons), and if Mars had a circular orbit the maximum and minimum temperatures would occur a couple of days after the summer and winter [[solstice]]s rather than about one month after as on Earth. The only difference between spring temperatures and summer temperatures is due to the relatively high eccentricity of Mars's orbit: in northern spring Mars is farther from the Sun than during northern summer, and therefore by coincidence spring is slightly cooler than summer and autumn is slightly warmer than winter. However, in the southern hemisphere the opposite is true.

The temperature variations between spring and summer are much less than the very sharp variations that occur within a single Martian sol (solar day). On a daily basis, temperatures peak at local solar noon and reach a minimum at local midnight. This is similar to the effect in Earth's deserts, only much more pronounced.

The axial tilt and eccentricity of Earth (or Mars) are by no means fixed, but rather vary due to [[Perturbation (astronomy)|gravitational perturbations]] from other planets in the [[solar system]] on a timescale of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years. Thus, for example Earth's eccentricity of about 1% regularly fluctuates and can increase up to 6%, and at some point in the distant future the Earth will also have to deal with the calendrical implications of seasons of widely differing length and the major climate disruptions that go along with it.

Aside from the eccentricity, the Earth's [[axial tilt]] can also vary from 21.5° to 24.5°, and the length of this "obliquity cycle" is 41,000 years. These and other similar cyclical changes are thought to be responsible for [[ice age]]s (see [[Milankovitch cycles]]). By contrast, the obliquity cycle for Mars is much more extreme: from 15° to 35° over a 124,000-year cycle. Some recent studies even suggest that over tens of millions of years, the swing may be as much as 0° to 60°.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/news/mars-water-science-00d.html The Obliquity of Mars&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Earth's large Moon apparently plays an important role in keeping Earth's axial tilt within reasonable bounds; Mars has no such stabilizing influence and its axial tilt can vary more chaotically.

==The color of the sky==
The normal hue of the sky during the daytime is a pinkish-red; however, in the vicinity of the setting or rising sun it is blue. This is the exact opposite of the situation on Earth. However, during the day the sky is a yellow-brown "butterscotch" color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humbabe.arc.nasa.gov/mgcm/faq/sky.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040810170442/http://humbabe.arc.nasa.gov/mgcm/faq/sky.html |archivedate=2004-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On Mars, [[Rayleigh scattering]] is usually a very small effect. It is believed that the color of the sky is caused by the presence of 1% by volume of [[magnetite]] in the dust particles. Twilight lasts a long time after the Sun has set and before it rises, because of all the dust in Mars's atmosphere. At times, the Martian sky takes on a violet color, due to scattering of light by very small water ice particles in clouds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://starryskies.com/The_sky/events/mars/opposition08.html The Martian Sky: Stargazing from the Red Planet]&lt;/ref&gt;

Generating accurate true-color images of Mars's surface is surprisingly complicated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/hoagland/mars_colors.html Phil Plait's Bad Astronomy: Misconceptions: What Color is Mars?]&lt;/ref&gt; There is much variation in the color of the sky as reproduced in published images; many of those images, however, are using filters to maximize the science value and are not trying to show true color. Nevertheless, for many years, the sky on Mars was thought to be more pinkish than it now is believed to be.

==Astronomical phenomena==

===Earth and Moon===

As seen from Mars, the Earth is an inner planet like Venus (a "morning star" or "evening star"). The Earth and Moon appear starlike to the naked eye, but observers with telescopes would see them as crescents, with some detail visible.

An observer on Mars would be able to see the Moon orbiting around the Earth, and this would easily be visible to the [[naked eye]]. By contrast, observers on Earth cannot see any other planet's satellites with the naked eye, and it was not until soon after the invention of the telescope that the first such satellites were discovered ([[Jupiter]]'s [[Galilean moons]]).
[[Image:PIA05547-Spirit Rover-Earth seen from Mars.png|thumb|right|200px|Earth as morning star, imaged by [[Spirit rover|MER ''Spirit'']] on March 7, 2004]]
At maximum angular separation, the Earth and Moon would be easily distinguished as a double planet, but about one week later they would merge into a single point of light (to the naked eye), and then about a week after that, the Moon would reach maximum angular separation on the opposite side. The maximum angular separation of the Earth and Moon varies considerably according to the relative distance between the Earth and Mars: it is about 17′ when Earth is closest to Mars (near [[inferior conjunction]]) but only about 3.5′ when the Earth is farthest from Mars (near [[superior conjunction]]). For comparison, the apparent diameter of the Moon from Earth is 31′.
[[Image:Earth and Moon from Mars PIA04531.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Earth and Moon from Mars, imaged by [[Mars Global Surveyor]] on May 8, 2003, 13:00 [[UTC]]. South America is visible.]]
The minimum angular separation would be less than 1′, and occasionally the Moon would be seen to [[astronomical transit|transit]] in front of or pass behind (be occulted by) the Earth. The former case would correspond to a lunar [[occultation]] of Mars as seen from Earth, and because the Moon's [[albedo]] is considerably less than that of the Earth, a dip in overall brightness would occur, although this would be too small to be noticeable by casual naked eye observers because the size of the Moon is much smaller than that of the Earth and it would cover only a small fraction of the Earth's disk.

[[Mars Global Surveyor]] imaged the Earth and Moon on May 8, 2003 13:00 UTC, very close to maximum angular [[Elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] from the [[Sun]] and at a distance of 0.930 AU from Mars. The [[apparent magnitude]]s were given as −2.5 and +0.9.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/2003/05/22/ Mars Global Surveyor MOC2-368 Release]&lt;/ref&gt; At different times the actual magnitudes will vary considerably depending on distance and the phases of the Earth and Moon.

From one day to the next, the view of the Moon would change very differently for an observer on Mars than for an observer on Earth. The [[lunar phase|phase of the Moon]] as seen from Mars would not change much from day to day; it would match the phase of the Earth, and would only gradually change as both Earth and Moon move in their orbits around the Sun. On the other hand, an observer on Mars would see the Moon rotate, with the same period as its orbital period, and would see far side features that can never be seen from Earth.

Since Earth is an inner planet, observers on Mars can occasionally view [[transit of Earth from Mars|transits of Earth]] across the [[Sun]]. The next one will take place in 2084. They can also view [[transit of Mercury from Mars|transits of Mercury]] and [[transit of Venus from Mars|transits of Venus]].

===Phobos and Deimos===
[[Image:PIA05553.gif|thumb|Phobos [[Transit of Phobos from Mars|eclipses]] the Sun, imaged by [[Mars Exploration Rover|MER]]]]

The moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] appears about one third the angular diameter that the full [[Moon]] appears from Earth; on the other hand, [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] appears more or less starlike with a disk barely discernible if at all. Phobos orbits so fast (with a period of just under one third of a sol) that it rises in the west and sets in the east, and does so twice per sol; Deimos on the other hand rises in the east and sets in the west, but orbits only a few hours slower than a Martian sol, so it spends about two and a half sols above the horizon at a time.

The maximum brightness of Phobos at "full moon" is about magnitude −9 or −10, while for Deimos it is about −5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.arm.ac.uk/~aac/mars/Information.html |title=Astronomical Phenomena From Mars |access-date=2005-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602015650/http://www.arm.ac.uk/~aac/mars/Information.html |archive-date=2008-06-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, the full [[Moon]] as seen from Earth is considerably brighter at magnitude −12.7. Phobos is still bright enough to cast shadows; Deimos is only slightly brighter than [[Venus]] is from Earth. Just like Earth's Moon, both Phobos and Deimos are considerably fainter at non-full phases. Unlike Earth's Moon, Phobos's phases and angular diameter visibly change from hour to hour; Deimos is too small for its phases to be visible with the naked eye.

Both Phobos and Deimos have low-inclination equatorial orbits and orbit fairly close to Mars. As a result, Phobos is not visible from latitudes north of 70.4°N or south of 70.4°S; Deimos is not visible from latitudes north of 82.7°N or south of 82.7°S. Observers at high latitudes (less than 70.4°) would see a noticeably smaller angular diameter for Phobos because they are farther away from it. Similarly, equatorial observers of Phobos would see a noticeably smaller angular diameter for Phobos when it is rising and setting, compared to when it is overhead.

Observers on Mars can view [[transit of Phobos from Mars|transits of Phobos]] and [[transit of Deimos from Mars|transits of Deimos]] across the [[Sun]]. The transits of Phobos could also be called partial [[Solar eclipses on Mars|eclipses of the Sun]] by Phobos, since the angular diameter of Phobos is up to half the angular diameter of the Sun. However, in the case of Deimos the term "transit" is appropriate, since it appears as a small dot on the Sun's disk.

Since Phobos orbits in a low-inclination equatorial orbit, there is a seasonal variation in the latitude of the position of [[shadow of Phobos on Mars|Phobos's shadow]] projected onto the Martian surface, cycling from far north to far south and back again. At any given fixed geographical location on Mars, there are two intervals per Martian year when the shadow is passing through its latitude and about half a dozen transits of Phobos can be observed at that geographical location over a couple of weeks during each such interval. The situation is similar for Deimos, except only zero or one transits occur during such an interval.

It is easy to see that the shadow always falls on the "winter hemisphere", except when it crosses the equator during the [[vernal equinox]] and the [[autumnal equinox]]. Thus transits of Phobos and Deimos happen during Martian autumn and winter in the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere. Close to the equator they tend to happen around the autumnal equinox and the vernal equinox; farther from the equator they tend to happen closer to the [[solstice|winter solstice]]. In either case, the two intervals when transits can take place occur more or less symmetrically before and after the winter solstice (however, the large eccentricity of Mars's orbit prevents true symmetry).
[[Image:Earth Sol63A UFO-A067R1.jpg|thumb|First meteor photographed from Mars, March 7, 2004, by [[Spirit rover|MER ''Spirit'']]]]

Observers on Mars can also view [[lunar eclipse]]s of Phobos and Deimos. Phobos spends about an hour in Mars's shadow; for Deimos it is about two hours. Surprisingly, despite its orbit being nearly in the plane of Mars's equator and despite its very close distance to Mars, there are some occasions when Phobos escapes being eclipsed.
 
Phobos and Deimos both have [[synchronous rotation]], which means that they have a "far side" that observers on the surface of Mars can't see. The phenomenon of [[libration]] occurs for Phobos as it does for Earth's [[Moon]], despite the low inclination and eccentricity of Phobos's orbit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1990A%26A...233..235B 1990A&amp;A...233..235B Page 235&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1991BAICz..42..271P 1991BAICz..42..271P Page 271&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the effect of librations and the [[parallax]] due to the close distance of Phobos, by observing at high and low latitudes and observing as Phobos is rising and setting, the overall total coverage of Phobos's surface that is visible at one time or another from one location or another on Mars's surface is considerably higher than 50%.

The large [[Stickney crater]] is visible along one edge of the face of Phobos. It is easily visible with the naked eye from the surface of Mars.

===Comets and meteors===
[[File:Mars-C2013A1SidingSpring-Orbits-20141019.png|thumb|right|250px|Projected path of [[C/2013 A1|Comet Siding Spring]] [[Astronomy on Mars#Comets and meteors|passing]] [[Mars]] on 19 October 2014.]]
Since Mars has an atmosphere that is relatively transparent at optical wavelengths (just like Earth, albeit much thinner), [[meteor]]s will occasionally be seen. [[Meteor shower]]s on Earth occur when the Earth intersects the orbit of a [[comet]], and likewise, Mars also has meteor showers, although these are different from the ones on Earth.
[[File:NASA-14090-Comet-C2013A1-SidingSpring-Hubble-20140311.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[C/2013 A1|Comet Siding Spring]] as seen by [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] on 11 March 2014.]]
The first meteor photographed on Mars (on March 7, 2004 by the ''[[Spirit (rover)|Spirit]]'' rover) is now believed to have been part of a meteor shower whose parent body was comet [[114P/Wiseman-Skiff]]. Because the radiant was in the constellation [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]], this meteor shower could be dubbed the Martian Cepheids.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7811359_Extraterrestrial_meteors_A_martian_meteor_and_its_parent_comet&lt;/ref&gt;

As on Earth, when a meteor is large enough to actually impact with the surface (without burning up completely in the atmosphere), it becomes a [[meteorite]]. The first known meteorite discovered on Mars (and the third known meteorite found someplace other than Earth) was [[Heat Shield Rock]]. The first and the second ones were found on the moon by the [[Apollo program|Apollo missions]].&lt;ref name=joy&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/metsoc2013/pdf/5315.pdf |title=Bench Crater meteorite: Hydrated Asteroid Material Delivered to the Moon |last1=Joy |first1=K.H |last2=Messenger |first2=S|last3=Zolensky |first3=M.E |last4=Frank |first4=D.R| last5=Kring |first5=D.A|date=2013|conference=76th Annual Meteoritical Society Meeting }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=metbuldb&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/index.php?code=11469 Meteoritical Bulletin Database: ''Hadley Rille'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auroras===
[[Aurora (astronomy)|Aurora]]s occur on Mars, but they do not occur at the poles as on Earth, because Mars has no planetwide magnetic field. Rather, they occur near magnetic anomalies in Mars's [[crust (geology)|crust]], which are remnants from earlier days when Mars did have a magnetic field. Martian auroras are a distinct kind not seen elsewhere in the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa003&amp;articleID=000F35AE-4DE0-12A7-8DE083414B7F0000| publisher=[[Scientific American]]|  date=2005-06-09| title=Martian Aurora Is One of a Kind| first=Sarah| last= Graham| accessdate=2006-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would probably also be invisible to the human eye, being largely ultraviolet phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news8987.html Hundreds of auroras detected on Mars&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celestial poles and ecliptic===
[[File:Northern_polar_sky_on_mars.png|280px|thumb|Celestial north pole on Mars]]
[[File:Southern_polar_sky_on_mars.png|280px|thumb|Celestial south pole on Mars]]
The orientation of Mars's axis is such that its north [[celestial pole]] is in [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] at [[right ascension|R.A.]] {{RA|21|10|42}} [[declination|Decl.]] {{DEC|+52|53.0}} (or more precisely, 317.67669 +52.88378), near the 6th-magnitude star BD +52 2880 (also known as HR 8106, HD 201834, or SAO 33185), which in turn is at R.A. {{RA|21|10|15.6}} Decl. {{DEC|+53|33|48}}.

The top two stars in the [[Cygnus (constellation)|Northern Cross]], [[Gamma Cygni|Sadr]] and [[Deneb]], point to the north celestial pole of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eknent.com/etc/mars_np.png]&lt;/ref&gt; The pole is about halfway between Deneb and [[Alpha Cephei]], less than 10° from the former, a bit more than the apparent distance between Sadr and Deneb. Because of its proximity to the pole, Deneb never sets in nearly all of Mars's northern hemisphere. Except in areas close to the equator, Deneb permanently circles the North pole. The orientation of Deneb and Sadr would make a useful clock hand for telling [[sidereal time]].

Mars's north celestial pole is also only a few degrees away from the [[galactic plane]]. Thus the [[Milky Way]], especially rich in the area of Cygnus, is always visible from the northern hemisphere.

The South celestial pole is correspondingly found at {{RA|9|10|42}} and {{DEC|-52|53.0}}, which is a couple of degrees from the 2.5-magnitude star [[Kappa Velorum]] (which is at {{RA|9|22|06.85}} {{DEC|-55|00.6}}), which could therefore be considered the southern polar star. The star [[Canopus (star)|Canopus]], second-brightest in the sky, is a circumpolar star for most southern latitudes.

The [[zodiac]] constellations of Mars's [[ecliptic]] are almost the same as those of Earth &amp;mdash; after all, the two ecliptic planes only have a mutual inclination of 1.85° &amp;mdash; but on Mars, the Sun spends 6 days in the [[constellation]] [[Cetus]], leaving and re-entering [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] as it does so, making a total of 14 zodiacal constellations. The equinoxes and [[solstice]]s are different as well: for the northern hemisphere, [[vernal equinox]] is in [[Ophiuchus]] (compared to [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] on Earth), summer solstice is at the border of [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] and Pisces, [[autumnal equinox]] is in [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], and winter solstice is in [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]].

As on Earth, [[precession]] will cause the solstices and equinoxes to cycle through the zodiac constellations over thousands and tens of thousands of years.

===Long-term variations===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Precession (astronomy)]] --&gt;

As on Earth, the effect of [[Precession (astronomy)|precession]] causes the north and south celestial poles to move in a very large circle, but on Mars the cycle is 175,000 Earth years

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
rather than 26,000 years as on Earth.

As on Earth, there is a second form of precession: the point of [[perihelion]] in Mars's orbit changes slowly, causing the [[anomalistic year]] to differ from the [[sidereal year]]. However, on Mars, this cycle is 83,600 years rather than 112,000 years as on Earth.

On both Earth and Mars, these two precessions are in opposite directions, and therefore add, to make the precession cycle between the [[Year#Sidereal.2C tropical.2C and anomalistic years|tropical and anomalistic years]] 21,000 years on Earth and 56,600 years on Mars.

As on Earth, the period of rotation of Mars (the length of its day) is slowing down. However, this effect is three orders of magnitude smaller than on Earth because the gravitational effect of Phobos is negligible and the effect is mainly due to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1988BAICz..39..168B 1988BAICz..39..168B Page 168&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On Earth, the gravitational influence of the Moon has a much greater effect. Eventually, in the far future, the length of a day on Earth will equal and then exceed the length of a day on Mars.

As on Earth, Mars experiences [[Milankovitch cycles]] that cause its [[axial tilt]] (obliquity) and orbital [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] to vary over long periods of time, which has long-term effects on its climate. The variation of Mars's axial tilt is much larger than for Earth because it lacks the stabilizing influence of a large moon like Earth's moon. Mars has a 124,000-year obliquity cycle compared to 41,000 years for Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4305">The '''Buxheim Organ Book''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Buxheimer Orgelbuch'') is a manuscript created around 1460/1470 with 256 original compositions and arrangements for keyboard instruments for the [[Buxheim Charterhouse]] in [[Germany]], in today's district of [[Unterallgäu]]. Most of the composers are anonymous, but some are also known composers of the time (e.g. [[John Dunstable]], [[Guillaume Du Fay]], [[Gilles Binchois]], [[Walter Frye]], [[Conrad Paumann]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/cds/nxs53466.htm|title=Buxheimer Orgelbuch|website=www.medieval.org|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
[[File:Buxheimer Orgelbuch (f°169r).jpg|alt=Manuscript|thumb|A page from the Buxheim Organ Book as preserved in Bavarian State Library, Munich]]
In addition to arrangements of secular chansons, dances and songs, it contains about fifty pieces of liturgical character and about thirty preludes, in which rhapsodic-figurative and purely chordal parts alternate. The pieces are mostly two- and three-part, but several are four-part.

The research is still at odds with the origins of the Buxheim Organ Book. There are no records of its use, so it can therefore be regarded as a transcript for teaching (or illustration) purposes. Presumably it came from a writer from the southern German area and was in the possession of the Buxheim Charterhouse near [[Memmingen]] from 16th century and until 1883, when it was offered for sale and has been owned by the [[Bavarian State Library]] in [[Munich]] since then. The manuscript is often attributed to [[Conrad Paumann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.553466&amp;catNum=553466&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English#|title=BUXHEIMER ORGELBUCH (DAS), Vol.  1|website=www.naxos.com|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-nr89013017/|title=Paumann, Conrad 1410-1473|last=|first=|date=|website=worldcat.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; because his "Fundamentum organisandi" is included in its entirety. This would mean that the manuscript originates from Munich, since from 1450 until his death in 1473, Paumann worked as a [[Bavaria]]n court organist in Munich. Paumann's "Fundamentum organisandi" is also included in the [[Lochamer-Liederbuch]], compiled around the same time.

The tabular inscription of the Buxheim Organ Book consists of a seven-line system and letters, the so-called "older" German [[organ tablature]].

CMOS was officially created in 1967 as the Canadian Meteorological Society and adopted its present name in 1977, following an invitation by the Canadian Meteorological Society to the oceanographic community in Canada to join the Society. However, CMOS has a rich history dating back to 1939 when it was known as the Canadian Branch of the [[Royal Meteorological Society]].&lt;ref name="cmos"/&gt;

In 2007, CMOS issued a position statement on [[global warming]]:

:CMOS endorses the process of periodic climate science assessment carried out by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and supports the conclusion, in its [[Third Assessment Report]], which states that the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmos.ca/climatechangepole.html Position Statement on Global Warming]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1296">'''Casting television''' is a competition [[television program]] where the winner wins a recording contract, or takes part in a competition.

== Slovakia ==

Slovakia's competition is Superstars, and the prize is a car, cash and recording contracts. Stars such as [[Zdenka Predna]] came to prominence this way.

== United Kingdom ==

Simon Cowell's "Popstars" is perhaps the most famous one of the lot, and other shows on a similar focus are ''[[Stars in Their Eyes]]'', and Andrew Lloyd Webber's ''[[How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?]]''.

== United States ==
Following directly on the UK template is the ''[[American Idol]]'' competition.

== Republic of Ireland ==

Ireland's version, called ''[[You're a Star]]'', had a unique twist: winners came into the Eurovision Song Contest as the prize.  However, after the disaster of the [[McCall Twins]] that format has been abandoned. The most famous winner and most successful in Eurovision (though he did not win) was [[Mickey Joe Harte]].

The '''[http://www.cfsp.org/ Consortium on Financial Systems and Poverty]''' (CFSP) is a private economic research consortium dedicated to studying the interaction of financial systems and poverty, using a variety of economic approaches in a range of developing countries.

The CFSP was established in 2009 by a grant to the University of Chicago from the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Grants-2009/Pages/University-of-Chicago-OPP51935.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314162337/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Grants-2009/Pages/University-of-Chicago-OPP51935.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Robert M. Townsend]] ([[MIT]]) as Principal Investigator, and economists [[Juliano Assuncao]] ([[Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro|PUC-Rio]]), [[Abhijit Banerjee]] ([[MIT]]), [[Francisco Buera]] ([[UCLA]]), [[Diamond-Dybvig model|Douglas Diamond]] ([[Booth School of Business]]), [[Weerachart Kilenthong]] ([[University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce]]), [[Gabriel de Abreu Madeira]] ([[University of São Paulo]]), [[Roberto Rigobon]] ([[MIT Sloan School of Management]]), [[Kenneth Singleton]] ([[Stanford]]), [[Tavneet Suri]] ([[MIT]]), [[Christopher Udry]] ([[Northwestern University]]), [[Christopher Woodruff]] ([[UCSD]]) as members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfsp.org/about/members |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109033328/http://www.cfsp.org/about/members |archivedate=2011-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFSP shares members with several other organizations that work in [[development economics]], including the [[Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab]], the [[Financial Access Initiative]], and [[Innovations for Poverty Action]]. In contrast to these organizations, however, which tend to focus on rigorous [[randomized evaluation]]s to generate policy recommendations,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.povertyactionlab.org/methodology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://financialaccess.org/research |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314233414/http://financialaccess.org/research |archivedate=2011-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://poverty-action.org/about/mission |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727184224/http://www.poverty-action.org/about/mission |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the CFSP attempts to connect traditional approaches in developmental economics to a wider range of approaches and models, including [[General equilibrium theory|general equilibrium models]] applied to both macro and regional financial systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfsp.org/about/about-consortium/cfsp-vision-statement |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109033313/http://www.cfsp.org/about/about-consortium/cfsp-vision-statement |archivedate=2011-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program refers to the bachelor's degree class L-10 (literary studies) and offers four majors in

* [[linguistics]] and [[didactics]],
* [[literature]],
* [[arts]] and
* [[history]] and [[culture]].

Exams are carried out at institutions in the country of residence (partner universities, Italian embassies). The title will be issued by the administrative university, actually Pisa, mentioning all participating universities. As Italy is part of [[European Higher Education Area]], the program has a value of 180 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] points and permits to participate in a [[Master's degree]] program.

== Master's degrees ==

The ICoN consortium organizes three [[executive master's degree]]s (60 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]) in the field of Italian studies. They consist of phases of attendance, distance education and e-learning. The offer includes

* [[Translation|Specialized translation]] (English–Italian), issued by the Universities of [[University of Pisa|Pisa]], [[University of Bari|Bari]] and [[University of Genoa|Genoa]]
* [[Didactics]] of Italian language and literature, issued by the Foreigner Universities of [[University for Foreigners Perugia|Perugia]] and [[Foreigners University of Siena|Siena]]
* [[Cultural heritage management]], issued by the [[University of Parma]]

== Language courses ==

The consortium ICoN also offers language courses and programs in written Italian at distinct levels. For native English speakers special packages have been designed in collaboration with the [[National Italian American Foundation]] and the [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California]]'s department of Italian. The courses have been awarded with the [[European Commission]]'s ''European Language Label''.

The '''''Ecce Homo''''' ('''Behold the Man''') in the Sanctuary of Mercy church in [[Borja, Zaragoza|Borja]], Spain, is a [[fresco]] painted circa 1930 by the Spanish painter [[Elías García Martínez]] depicting [[Jesus]] [[Crown of thorns|crowned with thorns]]. Both the subject and style are typical of traditional [[Catholic art]].&lt;ref name=CentroBorjanos&gt;[http://cesbor.blogspot.com.es/2012/08/un-hecho-incalificable.html "Un hecho incalificable"] (in Spanish).

==The original mural==
The artist, a professor at the School of Art of Zaragoza, gave the painting to the village where he used to spend his holidays, painting it directly on the wall of the church in about 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/disfigured-spanish-fresco-hit-artist-town-151848237.html|title=Disfigured Spanish Fresco Is Hit for Artist, Town|date=13 August 2013|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albarium Conservación y Restauración.

==Failed restoration attempt and internet phenomenon==
[[File:Attempted restoration of Ecce Homo.jpg|thumb|180px|Cecilia Giménez's attempted restoration of the fresco]]

The authorities in Borja said they had suspected vandalism at first, but then determined that the alterations had been made by an elderly parishioner, Doña Cecilia Giménez, who was in her 80s. She said on Spanish national television that she had started to restore the fresco, because she was upset that parts of it had flaked off due to moisture on the church's walls. Giménez defended herself, saying she could not understand the uproar because she had worked in broad daylight and had tried to salvage the fresco with the approval of the local clergyman. "The priest knew it," she told Spanish television. "I've never tried to do anything hidden."&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt;

News of the disfigured painting spread around the globe in August 2012 on mainstream and social media, which promptly led to the status of an [[List of Internet phenomena|internet phenomenon]]. BBC Europe correspondent [[Christian Fraser]] said that the result resembled a "crayon sketch of a very hairy monkey in an ill-fitting tunic".&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; The restored version has been jokingly dubbed ''"Ecce Mono"'' ('Behold the Monkey,' ''ecce'' is Latin, whereas ''mono'' is Spanish for 'monkey'; in Latin, it is ''simius'') in an "online rush of global hilarity",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |department=Editorial |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=24 August 2012 |title=Ecce mono |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/269a80c4-edec-11e1-8d72-00144feab49a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Elderly woman destroys 19th century fresco in do-it-herself restoration attempt |date=27 August 2012 |author=Victoria Cavaliere |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/elderly-woman-destroys-19th-century-fresco-do-it-herself-restoration-attempt-article-1.1142772 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=De Ecce Homo... |work=[[El Heraldo (Tegucigalpa)|El Heraldo]] |date=23 August 2012 |quote=Malestar e hilaridad general por destrozo que anciana 'restauradora' ocasionó a pintura.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compared to the plot of the film ''[[Bean (film)|Bean]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/23/church-masterpiece-restored-as-mr-bean-would-do-it |title=Church masterpiece 'restored' as Mr. Bean would do it |publisher=CNN |date= 23 August 2012|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the negative attention, the priest of the church, Father Florencio Garces, thought the painting should be covered up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=David Randall |author2=Megan Tatum |title=Botched art is an online sensation |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-33520671.html |location=London, England |publisher=''The Independent on Sunday'' (via HighBeam Research) |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic significance==
[[Tongue-in-cheek]] critiques have interpreted the piece as a multifaceted comment on both [[sacred]] and [[Secularity|secular]] themes. A ''[[Forbes]]'' commentator suggested that the "inept restoration" represented "one woman's vision of her savior, uncompromised by schooling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=[...] the updated monkey-like Christ has a freakish new power all its own, and may be its own kind of metaphor for modern man. |title=Spanish Octogenarian's Disastrous Unauthorized Art Restoration Yields Surprisingly Avant-Garde Results |author=Alexander Forbes |work=Art+Auction |date=23 August 2012 |url=http://artinfo.com/news/story/821028/spanish-octogenarians-disastrous-unauthorized-art-restoration-yields-surprisingly-avant-garde-results |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | quote= Works such as the Giménez Jesus are as vital for believers – and as insightful for the rest of us – as traditional masterpieces, albeit for different reasons...

      <comment>/* Definition */ The Ko et al. article cited here does include the quotation as written, but if you read the article, the authors clearly intended to sat "rather [than] public use," since they go on to say "the distinction here is that [the] program itself is not primarily intended for use by a large number of users with varying needs". I also added a blockquote to match the above style.</comment>

'''End-user development''' ('''EUD''') or '''end-user programming''' ('''EUP''') refers to activities and tools that allow [[User (computing)|end-user]]s – people who are not professional software developers – to [[Computer programming|program computers]]. People who are not professional developers can use EUD tools to create or modify ''software artifacts'' (descriptions of automated behavior) and complex data objects without significant knowledge of a [[programming language]]. In 2005 it was estimated (using statistics from the U.S. [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]) that by 2012 there would be more than 55 million end-user developers in the United States, compared with fewer than 3 million professional programmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scaffidi|first=C.|last2=Shaw|first2=M.|last3=Myers|first3=B.|date=2005-09-01|title=Estimating the numbers of end users and end user programmers|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1509505/|journal=2005 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC'05)|pages=207–214|doi=10.1109/VLHCC.2005.34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various EUD approaches exist, and it is an active [[Discipline (academia)|research topic]] within the field of [[computer science]] and [[human-computer interaction]]. Examples include [[natural language programming]],&lt;ref&gt;Little, Greg, and Robert C. Miller.

The most popular EUD tool is the [[spreadsheet]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/end-user_development.html|first1=Margaret M.|last1=Burnett|author1-link=Margaret Burnett|first2=Christopher|last2=Scaffidi|title=End-User Development|publisher=Interaction-Design.org}} at "Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Empowering Users"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2009/08/empowering-users-to-create-their-own-software.php|title=Empowering Users to Create Their Own Software|first=Peter |last=Hornsby |date=2009-08-03 |accessdate=2014-01-31 |website=UXmatters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their unrestricted nature, spreadsheets allow relatively un-sophisticated computer users to write programs that represent complex data models, while shielding them from the need to learn lower-level programming languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abraham |first=R. |last2=Burnett |first2=M |last3=Erwig |first3=M |year=2009 |chapter=Spreadsheet programming |title=Wiley Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Engineering |pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of their common use in business, spreadsheet skills are among the most beneficial skills for a graduate employee to have, and are therefore the most commonly sought after&lt;ref&gt;Kruck, S. &amp; Sheetz, S., 2001. [http://www.pucrs.br/ciencias/viali/tic_literatura/artigos/planilhas/KRUCK-SHEETZ_SpreadsheetAccTheory.pdf Spreadsheet accuracy theory]. Journal of Information Systems Education.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States of America alone, there are an estimated 13 million end-user developers programming with spreadsheets&lt;ref&gt;Scaffidi, C., Shaw, M. &amp; Myers, B., 2005. [http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~cscaffid/papers/eu_20050923_vlhcc.pdf Estimating the Numbers of End Users and End User Programmers]. 2005 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC’05), pp.207–214.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[programming by example]] (''PbE'') approach reduces the need for the user to learn the abstractions of a classic programming language. The user instead introduces some examples of the desired results or operations that should be performed on the data, and the PbE system infers some abstractions corresponding to a program that produces this output, which the user can refine. New data may then be introduced to the automatically created program, and the user can correct any mistakes made by the program in order to improve its definition. [[Low-code development platforms]] are also an approach to EUD.

One evolution in this area has considered the use of mobile devices to support end-user development activities. In this case previous approaches for desktop applications cannot be simply reproposed, given the specific characteristics of mobile devices. Desktop EUD environments lack the advantages of enabling end users to create applications opportunistically while on the move.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/532659/ Paternò F., 2013, ISRN Software Engineering, End User Development: Survey of an Emerging Field for Empowering People]&lt;/ref&gt; 

More recently, interest in how to exploit EUD to support development of Internet of Things applications has increased. In this area trigger-action programming seems a promising approach.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3057861&amp;ftid=1868975&amp;dwn=1&amp;CFID=15395619&amp;CFTOKEN=88b71644acac92dd-68065E67-C078-832A-D6A5CF54EBDFA5C9/ Ghiani, G., Manca, M., Paternò, F., Santoro, C.: Personalization of Context-dependent Applications through Trigger-Action Rules. ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, Vol.24, Issue 2, Article N.14, April 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lessons learned from EUD solutions can significantly influence the [[Software release life cycle|software life cycles]] for [[Software product management|commercial software products]], in-house [[intranet]]/[[extranet]] developments and [[Enterprise resource planning|enterprise application]] deployments.

==Application specific low code development platforms==
Roughly 40 vendors now offer solutions targeted at end users designed to reduce programming efforts. These solutions do not require traditional programming and may be based around relatively narrow functionality, e.g. contract management, customer relationships management, issue and bug tracking. Often referred to as low code development platforms, web based interactions guide a user to develop an application in as little as 40-80 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[[Low-code development platforms]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=December 2017}}

==Definition==
Lieberman et al. propose the following definition:&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, H., Paternò, F., Klann, M., and Wulf, V. (2006). End-User Development: An Emerging Paradigm. In: End-User Development, Lieberman, H., Paternò, F., and Wulf, V. (eds.), Springer Netherlands, 2006, ser. Human-Computer Interaction Series, vol. 9, Chapter 1, pp. 1-7, {{doi|10.1007/1-4020-5386-X_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;End-User Development can be defined as a set of methods, techniques, and tools that allow users of software systems, who are acting as non-professional software developers, at some point to create, modify or extend a software artifact.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ko et al. propose the following definition:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ko|first=Andrew J.|last2=Abraham|first2=Robin|last3=Beckwith|first3=Laura|last4=Blackwell|first4=Alan|last5=Burnett|first5=Margaret|last6=Erwig|first6=Martin|last7=Scaffidi|first7=Chris|last8=Lawrance|first8=Joseph|last9=Lieberman|first9=Henry|date=2011-04-01|title=The State of the Art in End-user Software Engineering|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1922649.1922658|journal=ACM Comput.

&lt;blockquote&gt;End-user programming is programming to achieve the result of a program primarily for personal, rather [than] public use.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Artifacts defined by end users may be objects describing some automated behavior or control sequence, such as database requests or grammar rules,&lt;ref&gt;H. Lieberman, B. A. Nardi, and D. Wright.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EUD essentially outsources development effort to the end user. Because there is always some effort to learn an EUD tool, the users' motivation depends on their confidence that it will empower their work, save time on the job or raise productivity. In this model, the benefits to users are initially based on marketing, demonstrations and word-of-mouth. Once the technology is put into use, experience of actual benefits becomes the key motivator.

This study defines costs as the sum of:

* Technical cost: the price of the technology and the effort to install it
* Learning cost: the time taken to understand the technology
* Development cost: the effort to develop applications using the technology
* Test and debugging cost: the time taken to verify the system

The first and second costs are incurred once during acquisition, whereas the third and fourth are incurred every time an application is developed. Benefits (which may be perceived or actual) are seen as:

* Functionality delivered by the technology
* Flexibility to respond to new requirements
* Usability of applications produced
* Overall quality of the applications produced

== Collaborations in end-user development ==
Many end-user development activities are collaborative in nature, including collaboration between professional developers and end-user developers and collaboration among end-user developers.

Mutual development&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andersen|first=Renate|last2=Mørch|first2=Anders I.|date=2009-03-02|title=Mutual Development: A Case Study in Customer-Initiated Software Product Development|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-00427-8_3|journal=End-User Development|language=en|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=31–49|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-00427-8_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a technique where professional developers and end-user developers work together in creating software solutions. In mutual development, the professional developers often “under design” the system and provide the tools to allow the “owners of problems&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-03035-6_23|title=User-Centred Requirements for Software Engineering Environments|last=Fischer|first=Gerhard|date=1994-01-01|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=297–306|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-662-03035-6_23}}&lt;/ref&gt;" to create the suitable solution at use time for their needs, objectives and situational contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-4020-5386-X_19|title=End User Development|last=Fischer|first=Gerhard|last2=Giaccardi|first2=Elisa|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9781402042201|editor-last=Lieberman|editor-first=Henry|series=Human-Computer Interaction Series|pages=427–457|language=en|doi=10.1007/1-4020-5386-x_19|editor-last2=Paternò|editor-first2=Fabio|editor-last3=Wulf|editor-first3=Volker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then the communication between professional developers and end-user developers can often stimulate formalizing ad hoc modifications by the end users into software artifacts, transforming end-user developed solutions into commercial product features with impacts beyond local solutions.

In this collaboration, various approaches such as the Software Shaping Workshop&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-4020-5386-X_1|title=End User Development|last=Lieberman|first=Henry|last2=Paternò|first2=Fabio|last3=Klann|first3=Markus|last4=Wulf|first4=Volker|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9781402042201|editor-last=Lieberman|editor-first=Henry|series=Human-Computer Interaction Series|pages=1–8|language=en|doi=10.1007/1-4020-5386-x_1|editor-last2=Paternò|editor-first2=Fabio|editor-last3=Wulf|editor-first3=Volker}}&lt;/ref&gt; are proposed to bridge the communication gap between professional developers and end-user developers. These approaches often provide translucency according to the social translucence model,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erickson|first=Thomas|last2=Kellogg|first2=Wendy A.|date=2000-03-01|title=Social Translucence: An Approach to Designing Systems That Support Social Processes|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/344949.345004|journal=ACM Trans. Comput.-Hum. Interact.|volume=7|issue=1|pages=59–83|doi=10.1145/344949.345004|issn=1073-0516}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabling everyone in the collaboration to be aware of changes made by others and to be held accountable of their actions because of the awareness.

Besides programming collaboration platforms like GitHub, which are mostly utilized by expert developers due to their steep learning curve, collaborations among end-user developers often take place on wiki platforms where the software artifacts created are shared. End-user development is also often used for creating automation scripts or interactive tutorials for sharing “how-to” knowledge. Examples of such application include CoScripter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leshed|first=Gilly|last2=Haber|first2=Eben M.|last3=Matthews|first3=Tara|last4=Lau|first4=Tessa|date=2008-01-01|title=CoScripter: Automating &amp; Sharing How-to Knowledge in the Enterprise|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1357054.1357323|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '08|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=1719–1728|doi=10.1145/1357054.1357323|isbn=9781605580111}}&lt;/ref&gt; and HILC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Intharah|first=Thanapong|last2=Turmukhambetov|first2=Daniyar|last3=Brostow|first3=Gabriel J.|date=2017-01-01|title=Help, It Looks Confusing: GUI Task Automation Through Demonstration and Follow-up Questions|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3025171.3025176|journal=Proceedings of the 22Nd International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces|series=IUI '17|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=233–243|doi=10.1145/3025171.3025176|isbn=9781450343480}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such applications, user can create scripts for tasks using pseudo-natural language or via programming by demonstration. The users can choose to upload the script to a wiki style repository of scripts. On this wiki, users can browse available scripts and extend existing scripts to support additional parameters, to handle additional conditions or to operate on additional objects.

Online and offline communities of end-user developers have also been formed, where end-user developers can collaboratively solve EUD problems of shared interest or for mutual benefit. In such communities, local experts spread expertise and advice. Community members also provide social support for each other to support the collaborative construction of software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=G.|last2=Giaccardi|first2=E.|last3=Ye|first3=Y.|last4=Sutcliffe|first4=A. G.|last5=Mehandjiev|first5=N.|date=2004-09-01|title=Meta-design: A Manifesto for End-user Development|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1015864.1015884|journal=Commun. ACM|volume=47|issue=9|pages=33–37|doi=10.1145/1015864.1015884|issn=0001-0782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Commentators have been concerned that end users do not understand how to test and secure their applications. Warren Harrison, a professor of computer science at Portland State University, wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=01309636 |title= The Dangers of End-User Programming |last=Harrison |first=Warren |journal=IEEE Software | volume=21 | issue=4 | date=July–August 2004 | format=PDF | doi=10.1109/MS.2004.13 | accessdate=2009-03-02|page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It’s simply unfathomable that we could expect security... from the vast majority of software applications out there when they’re written with little, if any, knowledge of generally accepted good practices such as specifying before coding, systematic testing, and so on.... How many X for Complete Idiots (where "X" is your favorite programming language) books are out there? I was initially amused by this trend, but recently I’ve become uneasy thinking about where these dabblers are applying their newfound knowledge.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This viewpoint assumes that all end users are equally naive when it comes to understanding software, although Pliskin and Shoval argue this is not the case, that sophisticated end users are capable of end-user development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1017817 |first=Nava |last=Pliskin |author2=Shoval, Peretz |title=End-user prototyping: sophisticated users supporting system development |journal=ACM SIGMIS Database |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=7–17|year=1987|doi=10.1145/1017816.1017817|accessdate=2008-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, compared with expert programmers, end-user programmers rarely have the time or interest in systematic and disciplined software engineering activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Joel|last2=Guo|first2=Philip J.|last3=Lewenstein|first3=Joel|last4=Klemmer|first4=Scott R.|date=2008-01-01|title=Opportunistic Programming: How Rapid Ideation and Prototyping Occur in Practice|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1370847.1370848|journal=Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on End-user Software Engineering|series=WEUSE '08|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=1–5|doi=10.1145/1370847.1370848|isbn=9781605580340}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes ensuring the quality of the software artifact produced by end-user development particularly challenging.

In response to this, the study of '''end-user software engineering''' has emerged. It is concerned with issues beyond end-user development, whereby end users become motivated to consider issues such as reusability, security and verifiability when developing their solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eusesconsortium.org/findings.php |title=End-User Software Engineering: Empirical Findings| publisher=End Users Shaping Effective Software Consortium | accessdate=2008-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative scenario is that end users or their consultants employ [[Declarative programming|declarative]] tools that support rigorous business and security rules at the expense of performance and scalability; tools created using EUD will typically have worse efficiency than those created with professional programming environments. Though separating functionality from efficiency is a valid [[separation of concerns]], it can lead to a situation where end users will complete and document the [[requirements analysis]] and [[Software prototyping|prototyping]] of the tool, without the involvement of [[Business analysis|business analysts]]. Thus, users will define the functions required before these experts have a chance to consider the limitations of a specific [[Application software|application]] or [[software framework]]. Senior management support for such end-user initiatives depends on their attitude to existing or potential [[vendor lock-in]].

'''Epimorphosis''' is defined as the [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] of a specific part of an organism in a way that involves extensive cell proliferation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/epimorphosis|title=Medical Definition of EPIMORPHOSIS|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[blastema]] formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yokoyama H | title = Initiation of limb regeneration: the critical steps for regenerative capacity | journal = Development, Growth &amp; Differentiation | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–22 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17986260 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-169X.2007.00973.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epimorphosis can be considered a simple model for [[Developmental biology|development]], though it only occurs in tissues surrounding the site of injury rather than occurring system-wide.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal  | vauthors = Kubo T, Arai T | date = September 1996|title=Insect Lectins and Epimorphosis|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tigg1989/8/43/8_43_357/_pdf/-char/en|journal=Trends in Glycoscience and Glycotechnology|publisher=Japanese Society of Carbohydrate Research|volume=8|issue=43|pages=357–364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Epimorphosis ==
[[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], an evolutionary biologist who also worked with embryology, argued that limb and tissue reformation bore many similarities to embryonic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sunderland ME | title = Regeneration: Thomas Hunt Morgan's window into development | journal = Journal of the History of Biology | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 325–61 | date = 2010-05-01 | pmid = 20665231 | doi = 10.1007/s10739-009-9203-2 | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10739-009-9203-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Building off of the work of German embryologist [[Wilhelm Roux]], who suggested regeneration was two cooperative but distinct pathways instead of one, Morgan named the two parts of the regenerative process epimorphosis and [[morphallaxis]]. Specifically, Morgan wanted epimorphosis to specify the process of entirely new tissues being regrown from an amputation or similar injury, with morphallaxis being coined to describe regeneration that did not use [[cell proliferation]], such as in [[Hydrozoa|hydra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/thomas-hunt-morgans-definition-regeneration-morphallaxis-and-epimorphosis | title = Thomas Hunt Morgan's Definition of Regeneration: Morphallaxis and Epimorphosis | work = The Embryo Project Encyclopedia | access-date = 2018-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epimorphosis in vertebrates==
[[File:Limb bud diagram.jpg|thumb|The [[apical ectodermal ridge]] in embryonic development is very similar to the [[apical ectodermal cap]] in limb regeneration. The [[progress zone]] can be seen near to the [[zone of polarizing activity]], which instructs cells on how to orient the limb.&lt;ref name="Summerbell_1973"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Summerbell D, Lewis JH, Wolpert L | title = Positional information in chick limb morphogenesis | journal = Nature | volume = 244 | issue = 5417 | pages = 492–6 | date = August 1973 | pmid = 4621272 | doi = 10.1038/244492a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|left|381x381px]][[File:The elements of experimental embryology (1963) (21260217591).jpg|alt=Dorsal and ventral views of a newt that has had a limb amputated and regrown.|thumb|Dorsal and ventral views of a newt that has had a limb amputated and regrown, from "The elements of experimental embryology"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://archive.org/details/elementsofexperi00huxl | title = The Elements of Experimental Embryology | last = Huxley | first = Julian | last2 = De Beer | first2 = Gavin | name-list-format = vanc | date=1963| location = New York | publisher = Hafner Pub. Co. }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Julian Huxley]] and [[Gavin de Beer]]. 
|306x306px]]In [[vertebrate]]s, epimorphosis relies on blastema formation to [[Wound healing|proliferate]] cells into the new tissue. Through studies involving [[zebrafish]] fins, the toetips of mice, and limb regeneration in [[axolotl]]s, researchers at the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] found evidence for epimorphosis occurring in a variety of vertebrates, including instances of mammal epimorphosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Animal models for the study of human disease | last = Conn | first = P. Michael | name-list-format = vanc | isbn = 978-0-12-809699-4 | edition = Second | location = London, United Kingdom | oclc = 992170104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salamanders===
Epidermal cells at the wound margins migrate to cover the wound and will become the wound epidermis.&lt;ref name="dev bio text"&gt;{{cite book | first = Scott F. | last = Gilbert | name-list-format = vanc | title = Developmental Biology | edition = Tenth | publisher = Sinauer Associates, Inc. | location = Sunderland, MA, USA | year = 2014 | pages = 571–573 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No scar tissue forms, as it would in mammals.

An [[apical ectodermal cap (AEC)]] forms on the tip of the stump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Issues in Biological, Biochemical, and Evolutionary Sciences Research | publisher = ScholarlyEditions | year = 2012 | isbn = | location=Atlanta, GA|pages=464}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to the embryonic [[apical ectodermal ridge]], which forms during normal [[limb development]].  The AEC causes the [[apical ectodermal ridge|progress zone]] to re-establish; this means the cells under the AEC [[Dedifferentiation|dedifferentiate]] and become [[mesenchyme|mesenchymal]].  The AEC releases [[fibroblast growth factor]]s (FGFs) (including [[FGF4|FGF-4]] and [[FGF8|-8]]) that drive the development of the new limb, essentially resetting the limb back to its embryonic development stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nye|first=Holly L.D.|last2=Cameron|first2=Jo Ann|last3=Chernoff|first3=Ellen A.G.|last4=Stocum|first4=David L.|title=Regeneration of the urodele limb: A review|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/dvdy.10236|journal=Developmental Dynamics|volume=226|issue=2|pages=280–294|doi=10.1002/dvdy.10236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even though some of the limb cells are able to dedifferentiate, they are not able to fully dedifferentiate to the level of [[multipotent]] progenitor cells. During regeneration, only cartilage cells can form new cartilage tissue, only muscle cells can form new muscle tissue, and so on. The dedifferentiated cells still retain their original [[cell fate determination|specification]].&lt;ref name="dev bio text"/&gt;

== Epimorphosis in invertebrates ==

=== ''Periplaneta americana'' ===
The [[American cockroach]] is capable of regenerating limbs that have been damaged or destroyed, such as legs and antennae, as well parts of its compound eye. It does this with [[lectin]]—a protein made for binding proteins—named [[regenectin]], which shares a family with other [[Lipopolysaccharide binding protein|lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding proteins]]. Regenectin carries both a regenerative and a system defense function, and it is produced by the cockroach's [[Paracrine signalling|paracrine system]] to work with muscle reformation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''Capitella teleta'' ===
[[Capitella teleta|''C. teleta'']] is a segmented worm found in North America that is capable of regenerating posterior segments after amputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fröbius|first=Andreas C.|last2=Matus|first2=David Q.|last3=Seaver|first3=Elaine C.|date=2008-12-23|title=Genomic Organization and Expression Demonstrate Spatial and Temporal Hox Gene Colinearity in the Lophotrochozoan Capitella sp.

All of the ''Hox'' genes concerned in epimorphosis are present in the abdominal area of the worm, but not in the anterior portion. However, the genes do not, themselves, direct the anterior-posterior patterning of the worm's thorax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Jong DM, Seaver EC | title = A Stable Thoracic Hox Code and Epimorphosis Characterize Posterior Regeneration in Capitella teleta | journal = PLOS One | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = e0149724 | date = 2016-02-19 | pmid = 26894631 | pmc = 4764619 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0149724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Planaria vitta'' ===
[[Planaria vitta|''P. vitta'']] is a [[flatworm]] of genus ''[[Planaria]]'' that, when needed, can draw upon both morphallaxis and epimorphosis to regrow itself; in ''P. vitta,'' epimorphosis precedes morphallaxis and lasts about ten days. The [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] contracts immediately after the worm is cut at the head, which activates [[totipotent]] regenerative cells, and [[rhabdite]]s gather on the epidermis. Near the time the eye-spots on the worm begin to take form, epimorphosis begins to shift over to morphallaxis, which then finishes regrowth into a complete individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pedersen|first=K.

[[File:FEI1.JPG|thumb|Federal Executive Institute]]
The '''Federal Executive Institute''' ('''FEI''') is an [[executive education|executive and management development]] and training center for governmental leaders located on a {{convert|14|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus near the center of [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], less than a mile from [[University of Virginia]].

FEI offers values-based [[leadership development]] opportunities through an "interagency 
residential learning experience" which emphasizes "personal growth as well as professional growth."&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, T.W. What's So Special? An Introduction. ''The Public Manager'' Vol.28 No.1 Spring 1999. Pg 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Programs are designed specifically for [[public sector]] [[senior management]].

==History==
The Federal Executive Institute was founded in 1968 "to endow the career leadership levels of the Federal government with the capacity and motivation to bring proactive change to a huge enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, Frank et al. The Early Years of the Federal Executive Institute (Bloomington, IN: iUniverse, 2010) 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
In the 1950s, the federal civilian workforce was larger than it had ever been. Millions of workers had been hired to manage the programs of the New Deal in the 1930s, and more still were brought into federal service to manage the American mobilization during World War II. However, the United States had not implemented any kind of education programs to prepare federal executives to manage this expanded workforce. As a result, the Society for Personnel Administration published a proposal for a "federal staff college" in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;   
Early ideas for senior executive education were based on military models, specifically the military staff colleges which were used to prepare officers for assignments in the upper ranks, specifically as admirals and generals. The United States military had a long experience of organizing and training millions of men and it was believed by many that a similar model of continuing education should be applied to civil servants, to prepare them for more senior assignments.&lt;ref&gt;Proposal for a Federal Staff College&lt;/ref&gt;  
The first step towards the creation of such a federal staff college was taken in 1958 when Congress passed the Government Employees Training Act. The act established several precedents that became central to the formation of the Federal Executive Institute. First and foremost, it cleared the way for the establishment of an executive training center funded by its own revenues, rather than by congressional allocations. This allowed FEI freedom of maneuver and sheltered it from political storms. Second, the act gave agency directors the authority to determine how much money they would spend on executive education and where they would send their executives to be trained. This encouraged FEI to remain tied to the senior executives it was founded to serve because they constantly had to market themselves to federal agencies. Finally, the act paved the way for interagency training. Interagency interaction would become one of the hallmarks of FEI, where senior executives from various backgrounds and agencies would live and learn with each other for weeks at a time.
However, it would still be approximately 10 years before FEI was founded. In the meantime, federal executives furthered their education primarily through the Brookings Institution. Additionally, the Civil Service Commission (CSC) founded two Executive Seminar Centers. The first was founded at King's Point, Long Island in 1963 and the second at Berkeley, California in 1966.  Even with these centers, Chairman Macy wanted more to be done. He wanted to create an institute for those civil servants who had reached the pinnacle of their careers, the "supergrades." These people could not be motivated by further promotion and would only attend the institute in order to improve their own work and the work done by their organizations. Therefore, in August 1966&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; the CSC completed a proposal for a center for advanced executive study to be called the Federal Executive Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creating the Federal Executive Institute===
Following President Johnson's speech, John Macy designated James Beck to coordinate the creation of the Federal Executive Institute. Beck visited potential sites for FEI including Colonial Williamsburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia, the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, the Walter P. Chrysler Estate, and Charlottesville, Virginia. The site needed to be near a university which the faculty could partner with, a location where courses could be held and executives housed, and be within driving distance of Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 38-40.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition to a location, the FEI needed a director. Chairman Macy was able to convince Frank Sherwood, who was teaching at the University of Southern California, to come to Charlottesville as the first director of the Federal Executive Institute. Macy chose Sherwood to be the FEI's first director because he wanted someone "with academic credentials who understands something about adult learning and adult education, who had a substance of understanding about problems of the Federal executive gained through academic research and study, someone with academic status and thus able to attract staff and deal with the University of Virginia."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Peggy. "Federal Executive Institute: Special School for the Super Grades." Government Executive, May 1969:58-61.&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted someone who could turn his vision of a university model within the federal government into a reality. Macy and Sherwood worked exceptionally together and the two soon formed a partnership that shaped the foundational years of FEI.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both agreed that FEI should have an Advisory Board. The FEI Advisory Board provided FEI with supporters placed throughout the government who knew about FEI's mission and the unusual way it operated.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; 
When the Civil Service Commission (CSC) began leasing the Thomas Jefferson Inn, the facilities were in a state of disrepair. Though the exterior had been maintained, leaking pipes and other problems created many maintenance projects that had to be completed in a very short period of time. To help accomplish this, most of the hotel staff was kept on and became the initial FEI staff. Along with other workers, they were able to complete the most necessary repairs and prepare the facility for the first class in October 1968.

===The First Session at FEI===
The first session at FEI began on October 13, 1968. Fifty-three executives were in attendance. All were from within the federal government and all but two were supergrades. The session lasted eight weeks, a period intended to take the executives away from the office long enough to allow them to "look seriously at themselves and their careers and to consider what changes they needed to make for the future." The curriculum was heavily based on John Gardener's book Self-Renewal and emphasized the ability to adapt and change over technical knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Nuechterlein]]. "FEI at Twenty: a Personal Retrospect." Bureaucrat. (Washington D.C.: National Capital Area Chapter of the American Society for Public Administration, Spring 1988) 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emphasis on change and adaptability was a product of the times. The initial FEI faculty had witnessed many changes in American society in the last decade. As a result, they believed that any attempt to prepare executives for the future was too big a gamble, since it was impossible to accurately predict what the future held. Instead, they wanted to prepare America's "civilian generals" for the future by teaching them how to adapt with change and harness it to accomplish their agency's primary mission.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  To ensure that FEI remained innovative, Macy and Sherwood only contracted faculty for short periods, ensuring that fresh personnel and ideas were always being brought to the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 58.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although self-development was an important part of the original FEI curriculum, Macy believed it should be one of several intellectual and learning goals that executives pursued while at FEI.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Macy and Sherwood intentionally created a learning environment that was learner focused. Individuals were allowed to tailor their experience to their needs and chose which courses they would take to supplement the main programs.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, T.B. Rocky Top, Rocky Road, Solid Rock: Thirty Years of Intellectual History at the Federal Executive Institute. Diss. Virginia Tech, 1998. Falls Church, VA: 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major problems Macy identified in federal civil service was that most executives ranked GS-13 or higher had no experience outside their own agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  It bothered John Macy that the majority of federal executives spent most of their career in one department or even in one bureau. He wanted talented people to gain experience outside what they already knew. So he designed FEI to encourage executives from different agencies to get to know each other and what each person's agency did, furthering an understanding of the functions of government across the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  The founders of FEI intentionally created a casual atmosphere to encourage the executives to mingle with each other and learn more about different government agencies. Executives were given nametags with names and agencies, not positions or rank, to encourage a feeling of equality rather than one of hierarchy among the executives.&lt;ref&gt;Nuechterlein, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===FEI within the Civil Service Commission===
When it was founded, FEI was placed outside the mainstream CSC bureaucracy. The FEI Director reported directly to the CSC Chairman, an unusual relationship for such a small institution. Macy created this relationship so that FEI would be as independent as possible while remaining part of the government. He and his successor, Robert Hampton, ensured that this relationship was preserved. However, when Alan Campbell became Chairman of the Commission and the CSC began transitioning into the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), FEI became part of OPM's larger training program, the Center for Leadership Development.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Today the Federal Executive Institute is part of OPM's Center for Leadership Development. FEI operates five programs of leadership development: Leadership for a Democratic Society (LDS), the FEI SES Leading EDGE Portfolio, Custom Executive Programs (CEP), Open Enrollment Courses (OEP), and the Center for Global Leadership (CGL).  Programs, workshops, and courses are designed and administered by a team of federally employed faculty and staff.  In addition, all programs are supported by adjunct faculty representing a wide spectrum of expertise.

===Leadership for a Democratic Society===
{{ad|date=October 2018}}
The four-week "Leadership for a Democratic Society" (LDS) program improves the leadership skills of senior career federal government executives to enhance their individual performance and the performance of government agencies.  The program focuses on four themes: personal leadership, transforming organizations, policy in a Constitutional system, and the global context for executive action.

LDS offers federal executives a residential learning experience.  Traditional sessions last four weeks while applied learning sessions consist of a two week period at FEI, three months back at the executives' home agency, and another two weeks at FEI. This program was designed to solve the issue that many interested executives are unable to take four weeks away from work.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 78.&lt;/ref&gt;  The maximum enrollment is approximately seventy executives per session, but FEI will often see up to 750 executives complete the LDS program per year.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In addition to an intense curriculum based on Constitutional values, LDS offers a personal approach to leadership development.  By incorporating 360-degree assessments, inventories of strengths and areas for improvement, and constant feedback from peers and facilitators, participants are led to a larger picture of self-awareness.  Executives learn in Leadership Development Teams (LDTs) which are smaller discussion and peer consultation groups that include guidance from a professional facilitator.  In addition, interagency networking is encouraged and fostered throughout the program.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Leadership for a Democratic Society program also includes a wellness track.  All participants complete a comprehensive health risk appraisal to include blood lipid profile and fitness assessment and nutritional counseling.  Executives are provided with the opportunity to take fitness classes in the mornings before breakfast and during the midday break as well as during the open hours when the fitness facility is available for individual exercise.  In addition, smaller breakout sessions and seminar focusing on specific health and wellness topics are offered during the program.  FEI offers on-campus gym facilities as well as a [[volleyball court]] and a [[swimming pool]].

===Custom Executive Programs ===
In addition to LDS, elements of FEI focus on [[Consultant|consulting]] and specific organizational needs within federal agencies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1553">A '''flow show''' is a device on a [[drilling rig (petroleum)|drilling rig]] that is attached to the [[flow line]] and has a paddle that swings out as the flow of [[drilling fluid]] passes by it. The angle of the paddle increases as the volume of drilling fluid increases and pushes it out further and vice versa.

The purpose of the flow show is to allow the driller (and other rig personnel) to monitor the flow of drilling fluid as it comes out of the hole. The reason for monitoring the flow:

*If a high pressure zone is drilled and overcomes the [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the column of drilling fluid, the fluid or gas in the high-pressure zone will begin to enter the [[borehole]] and increase the amount of fluid coming out of the hole. By monitoring the flow, rig personnel will know in advance before the flow becomes critical.
*If a low pressure zone is drilled and is overcome by the [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the column of drilling fluid, the low pressure zone may begin to ''take'' fluid and decrease the amount of fluid coming out of the hole. By monitoring the flow, rig personnel will know in advance before losing too much drilling fluid (which is typically very expensive) down the hole and/or losing so much fluid that the [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the (decreasing) column of mud becomes so low that a blowout situation becomes imminent.

See [[Drilling rig (petroleum)]] for a diagram of a drilling rig.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8609">A '''formula restaurant''' is a type of [[formula retail]] business. It is characterized as a restaurant regulated by contractual or other arrangements to standardize menus, ingredients, food preparation, interior and exterior design and/or uniforms. The term refers to the characteristics of the restaurant rather than its ownership, following a business model controlled by an overseeing corporation.  Most formula restaurants are [[chain store|chain restaurants]], though this does not have to be the case.

In legal definitions, there may be a minimum number of "substantially identical" restaurants for them to be considered formula restaurants. This number varies across jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="mccall"&gt;[http://www.mccall.id.us/uploads/committees/planning_zoning/20161004pzap.pdf McCall, ID proposal to amend restriction from "one or more" to "five"] (.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sf_use"&gt;[http://sf-planning.org/chain-stores-formula-retail-use San Francisco retail use] (11 or more)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="porttownsend"&gt;[http://www.codepublishing.com/WA/PortTownsend/html/PortTownsend17/PortTownsend1754.html Port Townsend] (14 or more)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formula retail==

Formula retail is a type of sales activity required by contractual or other arrangements to offer a standardized array of services and/or merchandise, trademark, interior or exterior design and/or uniforms.&lt;ref name="jaffrey_NH"&gt;[http://www.townofjaffrey.com/sites/jaffreynh/files/pages/summary_of_proposed_zoning_changes.pdf Town of Jaffrey Planning Board Proposed Zoning Changes Summary], Public Hearing January 22, 2018, Town of Jaffrey, New Hampshire (.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;  This applies to the restaurant industry where menus, ingredients and food preparation may be standardized according to the overseeing corporation's business model, intended to maximize marketing potential.

===Comparison with chain restaurants===

Although there is considerable [[financial]] overlap, "[[chain store|chain restaurant]]" refers to ownership or franchise while "formula restaurant" refers to the characteristics of the business. A formula restaurant doesn't need to belong to a chain but it generally does. Nevertheless, most codified municipal regulation relies on definitions of formula restaurant or formula retail (although non-codified restrictions will sometimes target "chains").

Some [[chain store|chain restaurants]] are not considered formula restaurants because the chain does not maintain a formulaic or monolithic character at different locations, or has few enough locations that they are substantially dissimilar to what is commonly considered to be a formula restaurant. In addition, the term "chain restaurants" generically describes a business arrangement, whereas formula restaurants describe the aesthetic characteristics and customer experience.

===Disguised formula restaurants===

In some cases, a chain may establish a set of formula restaurants but attempt to present each venue as unique. This is common with hotel chains, which rely on centralized meal planning and management, but want to avoid the appearance of their in-house dining facilities being formulaic. Generally, the local manager is encouraged to modify the corporate menu so as to present the appearance of a unique character, while still building the menu around a corporate model (e.g., several entrees based on frozen chicken breast in accordance with a corporate formula).&lt;ref name="cookiecutter"&gt;[https://www.hotelfandb.com/articles/39-building-a-successful-hotel-restaurant Building a Successful Hotel Restaurant], ''Hotel F&amp;B'', 4-Jul-2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newrecipe"&gt;[https://www.hotelmanagement.net/food-beverage/first-hospitality-group-s-john-harkey-wants-hotels-to-cook-a-new-recipie First Hospitality Group's Justin Harkey wants hotels to create a new recipe], ''Hotel Management'' 13-Apr-2017&lt;/ref&gt;  Disguised formula restaurants may be recognized by marketing indicators: intense use of staged photographs on the menu, frequent use of marketing [[Marketing buzz|buzzwords]] (or [[Corporate jargon#Marketing speak|marketing terms]]) such as "add" listed under multiple menu items.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gritsandgrids.com/2012/10/restaurant-menus-and-pictures-yes-or-no/ Restaurant menus and pictures: Yes or No?], gritsandgrids.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===Cultural===

Concerns have been expressed that formula restaurants detract from the unique characteristics of cities and towns.&lt;ref name="ILSR-impact"&gt;[https://ilsr.org/impact-chain-stores-community/ The Impact of Chain Stores on Community], Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ILSR-sanibel"&gt;[https://ilsr.org/rule/formula-business-restrictions/2323-2/ ILSR report on Sanibel, Florida business restrictions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marketplace-gentrification"&gt;[https://www.marketplace.org/2014/12/05/business/how-do-chain-restaurants-embody-gentrification How do chain restaurants embody gentrification?] ''Marketplace'' 5-Dec-2014&lt;/ref&gt; The standardization of menus can mean fewer choices for consumers. Formula restaurants tend to be marketing centric or based on perception.

===Economic===

Formula restaurants can harm local independent businesses.&lt;ref name="ILSR-impact" /&gt;&lt;ref name="governing"&gt;[http://www.governing.com/columns/assessments/gov-gentrification-local-business-extinction.html Hyper gentrification and the Disappearance of Local Businesses], governing.com&lt;/ref&gt;{{explain|date=October 2018}} Formula restaurants accelerate [[gentrification]] but deteriorate quality of life.&lt;ref name="governing" /&gt;{{how|date=October 2018}}

Formula restaurants often rely on an economic model that encourages the use of disposable tableware.&lt;ref name="dontbus"&gt;[http://www.skoozeme.com/issues/dontbus.html  www.skoozeme.com/issues/dontbus.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  This can create a negative economy in waste&lt;ref name="dontbus" /&gt; and food distribution, in part to support the business model of the controlling corporation.

==Response and regulation==
===Informal restrictions===
* [[Ketchum, Idaho]] has traditionally restricted franchise restaurants through the zoning approval process. The city has no formal formula restaurant ordinances.
* Iceland has informal health restrictions that discourage some formula restaurants.&lt;ref name="iceland webcam"&gt;[https://www.bushostelreykjavik.com/last-mcdonalds-in-iceland/ webcam] of "the last McDonald's in Iceland"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal restrictions===

===Legal challenges===
In the United States, legal restrictions on formula restaurants (and formula retail in general) have been challenged as an impermissible restriction on [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]], and as exceeding municipal zoning authority.&lt;ref name="park_v_malibu"&gt;[https://cases.justia.com/california/court-of-appeal/2017-b271620.pdf?ts=1498075335 The Park at Cross Creek v.

[[File:Lucas Cranach - Der Jungbrunnen (Gemäldegalerie Berlin).jpg|right|thumb|407x407px|[[The Fountain of Youth (Cranach)|The ''Fountain of Youth'']], 1546 painting by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]]]

The '''Fountain of Youth''' is a [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] that supposedly restores the youth of anyone who drinks or bathes in its waters. Tales of such a fountain have been recounted across the world for thousands of years, appearing in writings by [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC), the [[Alexander romance]] (3rd century AD), and the stories of [[Prester John]] (early Crusades, 11th/12th centuries AD). Stories of similar waters were also evidently prominent among the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] of the [[Caribbean]] during the [[Age of Exploration]] (early 16th century), who spoke of the restorative powers of the water in the mythical land of [[Bimini#The Fountain of Youth|Bimini]].

The legend became particularly prominent in the 16th century, when it was attached to the Spanish explorer [[Juan Ponce de León]], first [[Governor of Puerto Rico]]. According to an apocryphal combination of New World and Eurasian elements, Ponce de León was searching for the Fountain of Youth when he traveled to what is now [[Florida]] in 1513. The legend says that Ponce de León was told by Native Americans that the Fountain of Youth was in Bimini and it could restore youth to anyone.

==Early accounts==
[[Herodotus]] mentions a fountain containing a special kind of water in the land of the [[Macrobians]], which gives the Macrobians their exceptional longevity.{{Quote|The [[Ichthyophagi]]d then in their turn questioned the king concerning the term of life, and diet of his people, and were told that most of them lived to be a hundred and twenty years old, while some even went beyond that age{{mdash}}they ate boiled flesh, and had for their drink nothing but milk. When the Ichthyophagi showed wonder at the number of the years, he led them to a fountain, wherein when they had washed, they found their flesh all glossy and sleek, as if they had bathed in oil- and a scent came from the spring like that of violets. The water was so weak, they said, that nothing would float in it, neither wood, nor any lighter substance, but all went to the bottom. If the account of this fountain be true, it would be their constant use of the water from it which makes them so long-lived.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [[s:History of Herodotus/Book 3|Book III]]: 23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Al-khidr.jpg|thumb|left|[[Persian miniature]] depicting [[Khidr]] and [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] watching the Water of Life revive a salted fish]]

A story of the "Water of Life" appears in the Eastern versions of the [[Alexander romance]], which describes [[Alexander the Great]] and his servant crossing the [[Land of Darkness]] to find the restorative spring. The servant in that story is in turn derived from Middle Eastern legends of [[Al-Khidr]], a sage who appears also in the [[Qur'an]]. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Aljamiado]] versions of the ''Alexander Romance'' were very popular in Spain during and after the period of [[Al-Andalus|Moorish rule]], and would have been known to the explorers who journeyed to America. These earlier accounts inspired the popular medieval fantasy ''[[John Mandeville|The Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]'', which also mentions the Fountain of Youth as located at the foot of a mountain outside Polombe (modern [[Kollam]]&lt;ref&gt;Kohanski, Tamarah &amp; Benson, C. David (Eds.) ''The Book of John Mandeville''. Medieval Institute Publications (Kalamazoo), 2007. "[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/tkap2.htm Indexed Glossary of Proper Names]". Accessed 24 Sept 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;) in India.&lt;ref&gt;Mandeville, John. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/782/pg782.txt The Travels of Sir John Mandeville]''. Accessed 24 Sept 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the influence of these tales, the Fountain of Youth legend was popular in courtly [[Gothic art]], appearing for example on the ivory [[Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)]] and several ivory mirror-cases, and remained popular through the European [[Age of Exploration]].&lt;ref name="Peck"&gt;{{cite web|author=Peck, Douglas T|title=Misconceptions and Myths Related to the Fountain of Youth and Juan Ponce de Leon's 1513 Exploration Voyage|url=http://www.newworldexplorersinc.org/FountainofYouth.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=New World Explorers, Inc|accessdate=2008-04-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409062720/http://www.newworldexplorersinc.org/FountainofYouth.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:French - Mirror Cover with the Fountain of Youth - Walters 71170.jpg|thumb|French 14th-century ivory mirror case with a ''Fountain of Youth'']]

European [[iconography]] is fairly consistent, as the [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]] painting and mirror-case from 200 years earlier demonstrate: old people, often carried, enter at left, strip, and enter a pool that is as large as space allows. The people in the pool are youthful and naked, and after a while they leave it, and are shown fashionably dressed enjoying a courtly party, sometimes including a meal.

There are countless indirect sources for the tale as well. [[Eternal youth]] is a gift frequently sought in myth and legend, and stories of things such as the [[philosopher's stone]], [[universal panacea]]s, and the [[elixir of life]] are common throughout [[Eurasia]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Finding the Fountain of Youth: The Science and Controversy Behind Extending Life and Cheating Death|last=Zorea|first=Aharon|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1440837982|location=Westport, CT|pages=35–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional hint may have been taken from the account of the [[Pool of Bethesda]] in the [[Gospel of John]], in which [[Jesus]] heals a man at the pool in [[Jerusalem]].

==Bimini==
{{main|Bimini#The Fountain of Youth}}
According to legend, the Spanish heard of Bimini from the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]]s in [[Hispaniola]], [[Cuba]], and [[Puerto Rico]]. The Caribbean islanders described a mythical land of ''Beimeni'' or ''Beniny'' (whence [[Bimini]]), a land of wealth and prosperity, which became conflated with the fountain legend. By the time of Ponce de Leon, the land was thought to be located northwest towards the Bahamas (called ''la Vieja'' during the Ponce expedition). The natives were probably referring to the area occupied by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]].&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; This land also became confused with the [[Boinca]] or [[Boyuca]] mentioned by [[Juan de Solis]], although Solis's navigational data placed it in the [[Gulf of Honduras]]. It was this Boinca that originally held a legendary fountain of youth, rather than Bimini itself.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; [[Sequene]], an Arawak chief from [[Cuba]], purportedly was unable to resist the lure of Bimini and its restorative fountain. He gathered a troupe of adventurers and sailed north, never to return.

Found within the salt water [[mangrove]] swamp that covers {{convert|6|km|mi}} of the shoreline of North Bimini is ''The Healing Hole'', a pool that lies at the end of a network of winding underground tunnels. During outgoing tides, these channels pump cool, [[Mineral water|mineral-laden]] fresh water into the pool. Because this well was carved out of the limestone rock by ground water thousands of years ago it is especially high in calcium and [[magnesium]].{{cn|date=February 2017}} Magnesium, which has been shown to improve longevity and reproductive health,&lt;ref&gt;EPIDEMIOLOGY OF WATER MAGNESIUM;EVIDENCE OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO HEALTH

==Ponce de León==
[[File:Ponce de León.jpg|thumb| 19th-century German artist’s impression of [[Juan Ponce de León]] and his explorers drinking from a spring in [[Florida]] while supposedly seeking the Fountain of Youth]]
In the 16th century the story of the Fountain of Youth became attached to the biography of the [[conquistador]] [[Juan Ponce de León]]. As attested by his royal charter, Ponce de León was charged with discovering the land of ''[[Bimini|Beniny]]''.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; Although the indigenous peoples were probably describing the land of the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] in [[Yucatán region|Yucatán]], the name{{mdash}}and legends about Boinca's fountain of youth{{mdash}}became associated with the [[Bahamas]] instead. However, Ponce de León did not mention the fountain in any of his writings throughout the course of his expedition.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt;

The connection was made in [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo]]'s ''Historia general y natural de las Indias'' of 1535, in which he wrote that Ponce de León was looking for the waters of Bimini to regain youthfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo. ''Historia general y natural de las Indias'', book 16, chapter XI.&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have suggested that Oviedo's account may have been politically inspired to generate favor in the courts.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; A similar account appears in [[Francisco López de Gómara]]'s ''Historia general de las Indias'' of 1551.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco López de Gómara. ''Historia general de las Indias'', second part.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Memoir'' of [[Hernando d'Escalante Fontaneda]] in 1575, the author places the restorative waters in Florida and mentions de León looking for them there; his account influenced [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]]' unreliable history of the Spanish in the New World.&lt;ref name=Fontaneda&gt;[http://www.keyshistory.org/Fontenada.html "Fontaneda's Memoir"]. Translation by Buckingham Smith, 1854. From keyshistory.org. Retrieved July 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Fontaneda had spent seventeen years as an Indian captive after being shipwrecked in Florida as a boy. In his ''Memoir'' he tells of the curative waters of a lost river he calls "[[Jordan River (symbolism)|Jordan]]" and refers to de León looking for it. However, Fontaneda makes it clear he is skeptical about these stories he includes, and says he doubts de León was actually looking for the fabled stream when he came to Florida.&lt;ref name=Fontaneda /&gt;

Herrera makes that connection definite in the romanticized version of Fontaneda's story included in his ''Historia general de los hechos de los Castellanos en las islas y tierra firme del Mar Oceano''. Herrera states that local [[cacique]]s paid regular visits to the fountain. A frail old man could become so completely restored that he could resume "all manly exercises … take a new wife and beget more children." Herrera adds that the Spaniards had unsuccessfully searched every "river, brook, lagoon or pool" along the Florida coast for the legendary fountain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''The European Discovery of America: The Southern Voyages 1492{{ndash}}1616'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1974), p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park==
{{main|Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park}}
[[File:Fountain of Youth postcard.jpg|thumb|Postcard from the Fountain of Youth in St. Augustine]]
The city of [[St. Augustine, Florida]], is home to the Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park, a tribute to the spot where Ponce de León was supposed to have landed according to promotional literature, although there is no historical or archaeological evidence to support the claim. There were several instances of the property being used as an attraction as early as the 1860s; the tourist attraction in its present form was created by Luella Day McConnell in 1904. Having abandoned her practice as a physician in Chicago and gone to the [[Yukon]] during the [[Klondike gold rush]] of the 1890s, she purchased the Park property in 1904 from Henry H. Williams, a British horticulturalist, with cash and diamonds, for which she became known in St. Augustine as "Diamond Lil". Around the year 1909 she began advertising the attraction, charging admission, and selling post cards and water from a well dug in 1875 for Williams by Philip Gomez and Philip Capo.&lt;ref name="KimJonesNPS2016"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Sujin Kim |author2=Robert 0.

The exact spot of the landing will probably never be known. The claim that the actual site of the landing has been definitely established at the Fountain of Youth Park seems unsupported by satisfactory evidence. The Fountain of Youth seems to be a well, not a spring, and to be without authenticated historical importance. One gets the impression that an effort is made to give the tourists their money's worth and to popularize history with such revisions as will best serve the gate receipts, and that in so doing historical accuracy has suffered.}}&lt;/ref&gt; McConnell later claimed to have "discovered" on the grounds a large cross made of [[coquina]] rock, asserting it was placed there by Ponce de León himself. She continued to fabricate stories to amuse and appall the city's residents and tourists until her death in a car accident in 1927. 

Walter B. Fraser, a transplant from Georgia who managed McConnell's attraction, then bought the property and made it one of the state's most successful tourist attractions.&lt;ref name="Clark2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=James C.

These digs produced a large number of Christianized [[Timucua]] burials. These burials eventually pointed to the Park as the location of the first Christian mission in the United States. Called the [[Mission Nombre de Dios]], this mission was begun by Franciscan friars in 1587. Succeeding decades have seen the unearthing of items which positively identify the Park as the location of [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]]'s 1565 settlement of St. Augustine, the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in North America. The park currently exhibits native and colonial artifacts to celebrate St. Augustine's Timucua and Spanish heritage.

'''Han Pao-teh''' ({{zh|c=漢寶德|p=Hàn Bǎodé}}; 19 August 1934 – 20 November 2014) was a [[Taiwan]]ese architect, educator and curator.

Han Pao-teh was born and raised in [[Shandong]], China and moved to Taiwan in 1952. In 1958, he graduated in architecture from Tainan Institute of Technology, now known as the [[National Cheng Kung University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/fp.asp?xItem=24778&amp;CtNode=2196 |title=A Postmodern Traditionalist |author=Kelly Her |magazine=Taiwan Today |volume=57  |issue=11 |date=November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a scholarship to [[Harvard University]] in the United States for a master's degree in architecture in 1965 and then also gained an MA degree at [[Princeton University]] in 1967.

He returned to Taiwan in 1967, where he lectured as the head of the Department of Architecture at [[Tunghai University]] in [[Taichung]]. He left Tunghai in 1977 to be Dean of the College of Science and Engineering at [[National Chung Hsing University]]. He was one of the architects who played a role in the preservation of historic structures, including the [[Lin Family Mansion and Garden|Lin Family Mansion]] in [[Banqiao District|Banqiao]].&lt;ref name="Wu1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dingbo Wu|title=Handbook of Chinese Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V0R-3zFSJbkC&amp;pg=PA341|year=1994|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-27808-2|pages=341–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1981–1986, Han Pao-teh was appointed by the [[Executive Yuan]] to lead the preparation for the establishment of [[National Museum of Natural Science]], the first modern museum in Taiwan, where he was also appointed by the Ministry of Education the first Director from 1987 to 1995. In 1993, Han Pao-teh was also appointed to establish [[Tainan National University of the Arts]] (TNNUA), where he was also selected to be the first president of TNNUA and the program chair of  [https://web.archive.org/web/20080403092430/http://web.tnnua.edu.tw/~museum/news_txt.htm the graduate school of Museum Studies] in 1996. Shortly after his retirement from TNNUA in 2000, Han Pao-teh was invited by the Ling Jiou Mountain Buddhist Foundation to be the first curator of the [[Museum of World Religions]]. During 1998–2001, he was also the director of [http://www.ncafroc.org.tw/ National Culture and Arts Foundation]. Han Pao-teh has been appointed the [[Geheimrat]] of [[Presidential Office Building, Taipei|Presidential Office]] in Taiwan since 2001.

Han Pao-teh died in Taipei, Taiwan, on 20 November 2014. He was posthumously given the Executive Yuan Culture Award, the nation's highest cultural award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Executive Yuan honors contributors to national culture |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/11/26/2003605346 |newspaper=Taipei Times |location= |date=26 November 2014 |accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also known as '''Damas–Milner''' or '''Damas–Hindley–Milner'''. It was first described by [[J. Roger Hindley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = J. Roger Hindley | first = J.

Among HM's more notable properties are its completeness and its ability to infer the [[principal type|most general type]] of a given program without programmer-supplied [[type annotation]]s or other hints. [[#Algorithm W|Algorithm W]] is an efficient [[type inference]] method that performs in almost [[linear time]] with respect to the size of the source, making it practically useful to type large programs.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Hindley–Milner is [[DEXPTIME]]-complete. Non-linear behaviour does manifest itself, yet only on [[Pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] inputs. Thus the complexity theoretic proofs by {{harvtxt|Mairson|1990}} and {{harvtxt|Kfoury|Tiuryn|Urzyczyn|1990}} came as a surprise to the research community. When the depth of nested let-bindings is bounded—which is the case in realistic programs—Hindley–Milner type inference becomes polynomial.&lt;/ref&gt; HM is preferably used for [[functional language]]s. It was first implemented as part of the type system of the programming language [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. Since then, HM has been extended in various ways, most notably with [[type class]] constraints like those in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]].

==Introduction==

{{main|Type system}}

One and the same thing can be used for many purposes.  A [[chair]] might be used to support a sitting person but also as a [[ladder]] to stand on while changing a light bulb or as a [[clothes valet]]. Beside having particular material qualities, which make a chair usable as such, it also has the particular designation for its use. When no chair is at hand, other things might be used as a seat, and so the designation of a thing can be changed as fast as one can turn an empty bottle crate upside down to change its purpose from a container to that of a support.

Different uses of physically near-identical things are usually accompanied by giving those things different names to emphasize the intended purpose. Depending on the use, seamen have a dozen or more words for a [[rope]] though it might materially be the same thing. The same in everyday language, where a [[leash]] indicates a use different to a [[clothes line|line]].

In computer science, this practice of naming things by its intended use is put to an extreme called ''typing'' and the names or expressions called ''types'':

* Contrary to the richly varying raw materials in the physical world, computing has only one raw material, bytes, and much like letters in a book they are used to build up and express everything in a computer's memory.
* Programmers not only have many words indicating the different uses for bytes, but rather a plethora of formal ''type'' ''languages'', each having their own grammar.
* There are branches of research in computer science and mathematics dedicated to developing and enhancing such languages. Their theoretical foundations have [[type systems]] and [[type theory]] as their subjects.
* Types are not only used in specifications and documentations, but are also an integral part of programming languages. There, they are mechanised to strongly support the programmers' tasks.

Beside structuring objects, (data) types serve as means to validate that these objects are used as intended. Much like a crate that could only be used as a support or a container at a time, a particular arrangement of bytes designated for one purpose might exclude other possible uses.

In programming, these uses are expressed as ''functions'' or ''procedures'' which serve the role of verbs in [[natural language]]. As an example for typing verbs, an English dictionary might define ''gift'' as "to give so. sth.", indicating that the object must be a person and the indirect object a physical thing. In programming, "so." (someone) and "sth." (something) would be called types and using a thing into the place of "so." would be indicated as a programming error by a [[type checker]].

Beside checking, one can use the types in this example to gain knowledge about an unknown word. Reading the sentence "Mary gifts John a bilber" the types could be used to conclude that a "bilber" is likely a physical thing. This activity and conclusion is called ''type inference''. As the story unfolds, more and more information about the unknown "bilber" may be gained, and eventually enough details become known to form a complete image of that kind of thing.

The type inference method designed by [[J. Roger Hindley|Hindley]] and [[Robin Milner|Milner]] does just this for programming languages. The advantage of type inference over type checking is that it allows a more natural and dense style of programming. Instead of starting a program text with a glossary defining what a bilber and everything else is, one can distribute this information over the text simply by using the yet undefined words and let a program collect all the details about them. The method works for both nouns (data types) and for verbs (functions types).  As a consequence, a programmer can proceed without ever mentioning types at all, while still having the full support of a type checker that validates their writing. When reading a program, the programmer can use type inference to query the full definition of anything named in the program whenever needed.

=== History of type inference ===
Historically, type inference to this extent was developed for a particular group of programming languages, called [[functional languages]]. These started in 1958 with [[Lisp]], a programming language based on the [[lambda calculus]] and that compares well with modern [[scripting languages]] like [[Python (programming language)|Python]] or [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]]. Lisp was mainly used for computer science research, often for symbol manipulation purposes where large, tree-like data structures were common.

Data in Lisp is [[dynamic type|dynamically typed]] and the types are only available to some degree while running a program. Debugging type errors was no less of a concern than it is with modern script languages. But, being completely untyped, i.e. written without any explicit type information, maintaining large programs written in Lisp soon became a problem because the many complicated types of the data were mentioned only in the program documentation and comments at best.

Thus, the need to have a Lisp-like language with machine-checkable types became more and more pressing. At some point, programming language development faced two challenges:

# [[Polymorphism (computer science)|Polymorphism]]. Some kinds of data are very generic. In particular, Lisp is a "list programming language" where lists are data whose type can be a "list of something", e.g. a list of numbers.  Functions for such generic data types are often themselves generic. For instance, counting the number of items on a list is independent of the type of its items. However, a generic function that adds another item to a given list, needs type checking to ensure that the list will remain consistent with respect to the type of its items. For example, that only numbers may be added to a list of numbers.  Types for such "generic" data and functions are called ''polymorphic'', meaning that they can be used for more than one type. The polymorphic function for adding an item can be used for a list of numbers as well as for a list of words or even a list of anything. More precisely, this kind of polymorphism is called [[parametric polymorphism]], where "something" is the parameter in "list of something".  More formally, "list of something" may be written &lt;code&gt;List T&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; being the type parameter. The type of a function that adds a new item to a list is &lt;code&gt;forall T . T -&gt; List T -&gt; List T&lt;/code&gt;, meaning that for any and all types T the adding function needs an item of type T and a list-of-Ts, to produce a resulting (new) list-of-Ts.  Thus, the first challenge was, to design a type system that properly expressed parametric polymorphism.
# [[Type inference]]. Unfortunately, polymorphic functions requiring type checking must be continuously informed of the types. The above function would need the type T as an additional first parameter, resulting in program text so cluttered with type information that it becomes unreadable. Additionally, when keying in a program, a programmer would spend a significant portion of time keying in types.

As an example, polymorphically constructing the list "(1 2)" of two numbers would mean writing:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
  (addItem Number 1 (addItem Number 2 (emptyList Number)))
&lt;/source&gt;

This example was quite typical. Every third word a type, monotonously serving the type checker in every step. This worsens when the types become more complex. Then, the methods to be expressed in code become buried in types.

To handle this issue, effective methods for type inference were the subject of research, and Hindley-Milner's method was one of them. Their method was first used in [[ML (programming language)|ML]] (1973) and is also used in an extended form in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] (1990). The HM type inference method is strong enough to infer types not only for expressions, but for whole programs including the procedures and local definitions, providing a type-less style of programming.

The following text gives an impression of the resulting programming style for the [[quicksort]] procedure in Haskell:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
quickSort []     = []                           -- Sort an empty list
quickSort (x:xs) = quickSort (filter (&lt;x) xs)   -- Sort the left part of the list
                   ++ [x] ++                    -- Insert pivot between two sorted parts
                   quickSort (filter (&gt;=x) xs)  -- Sort the right part of the list
&lt;/source&gt;

Though all of the functions in the above example need type parameters, types are nowhere mentioned. The code is statically type-checked even though the type of the function defined is unknown and must be inferred to type-check the applications in the body.

Over the years, other programming languages added their own version of parametric types. [[C++]] templates were introduced in 1998 and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] introduced [[Generics in Java|generics]] in 2004. As programming with type parameters became more common, problems similar to the ones sketched for Lisp surfaced in [[imperative programming|imperative languages]] too, perhaps not as pressing as it was for the functional languages. As a consequence, these languages obtained support for some type inference techniques, for instance "auto" in [[C++11#Type inference|C++11]] (2014). Unfortunately, the stronger type inference methods developed for functional programming cannot simply be integrated in the imperative languages, as their type systems' features are in part incompatible, and a programming language must be designed from the ground up when continuous type inference is wanted.

== Features of the Hindley–Milner method ==

Before presenting the HM type system and related algorithms, the following sections make some features of HM more formal and precise.

===Type-checking vs. type-inference===

In a typing, an expression E is opposed to a type T, formally written as E : T. Usually a typing only makes sense within some context, which is omitted here.

In this setting, the following questions are of particular interest:

# E : T? In this case, both an expression E and a type T are given. Now, is E really a T? This scenario is known as [[type-checking]].
# E : _? Here, only the expression is known. So, what type is E? If there is a way to derive a type for E, then we have accomplished [[type inference]].
# _ : T? The other way round. Given only a type, is there any expression for it or does the type have no values? Is there any example of a T? And in light of the [[Curry–Howard isomorphism]], is there a proof for T?

For the [[simply typed lambda calculus]], all three questions are decidable. The situation is not as comfortable when more expressive types are allowed. Additionally, the simply typed lambda calculus makes the types of the parameters of each function explicit, while they are not needed in HM. While HM is a method for type inference, it can be used also for type checking and answer the first question. To do that, a type is first inferred from E and then compared with the type wanted. The third question becomes of interest when looking at recursively-defined functions at the end of this article.

===Monomorphism vs. polymorphism===

{{main|parametric polymorphism}}

In the [[simply typed lambda calculus]], types &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; are either atomic type constants or function types of form &lt;math&gt;T \rightarrow T&lt;/math&gt;.  Such types are ''monomorphic''. Typical examples are the types used in arithmetic values:

  3       : Number
  add 3 4 : Number
  add     : Number -&gt; Number -&gt; Number

Contrary to this, the untyped lambda calculus is neutral to typing at all, and many of its functions can be meaningfully applied to all type of arguments. The trivial example is the identity function

:id &lt;math&gt;\equiv \lambda&lt;/math&gt; x . x

which simply returns whatever value it is applied to. Less trivial examples include parametric types like lists.

While polymorphism in general means that operations accept values of more than one type, the polymorphism used here is parametric. One finds the notation of ''type schemes'' in the literature, too, emphasizing the parametric nature of the polymorphism. Additionally, constants may be typed with (quantified) type variables. E.g.:

  cons : forall a . a -&gt; List a -&gt; List a
  nil  : forall a . List a.
  id   : forall a . a -&gt; a

Polymorphic types can become monomorphic by consistent substitution of their variables. Examples of monomorphic ''instances'' are:

 id'  : String -&gt; String
 nil' : List Number

More generally, types are polymorphic when they contain type variables, while types without them are monomorphic.

Contrary to the type systems used for example in [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] (1970) or [[C (programming language)|C]] (1972), which only support monomorphic types, HM is designed with emphasis on parametric polymorphism. The successors of the languages mentioned, like [[C++]] (1985), focused on different types of polymorphism, namely [[Polymorphism (computer science)#Subtyping|subtyping]] in connection with object-oriented programming and [[Polymorphism (computer science)#Ad hoc polymorphism|overloading]]. While subtyping is incompatible with HM, a variant of systematic overloading is available in the HM-based type system of Haskell.

===Let-polymorphism===

When extending the simply-typed lambda calculus towards polymorphism, one has to define when deriving an instance of a value is admissible. Ideally, this would be allowed with any use of a bound variable, as in:

  (λ id .  ... (id 3) ... (id "text") ... ) (λ x . x)

Unfortunately, type inference in such a system is not decidable.{{Citation needed|reasoning=Not obvious, under what rules.|date=November 2018}} Instead, HM provides ''let-polymorphism'' of the form

  '''let''' id = λ x . x
   '''in''' ... (id 3) ... (id "text") ...

restricting the binding mechanism in an extension of the expression syntax. Only values bound in a let construct are subject to instantiation, i.e. are polymorphic, while the parameters in lambda-abstractions are treated as being monomorphic.

==Overview==

The remainder of the article is more technical as it has to present the HM method as it is handled in the literature. It proceeds as follows:

* The HM type system is defined. This is done by describing a deduction system that makes precise what expressions have what type, if any.
* From there, it works towards an implementation of the type inference method. After introducing a syntax driven variant of the above deductive system, it sketches an efficient implementation (algorithm J), appealing mostly to the reader's metalogical intuition.
* Because it remains open whether algorithm J indeed realises the initial deduction system, a less efficient implementation (algorithm W), is introduced and its use in a proof is hinted.
* Finally, further topics related to the algorithm are discussed.

The same description of the deduction system is used throughout, even for the two algorithms, to make the various forms in which the HM method is presented directly comparable.

== The Hindley–Milner type system ==

The type system can be formally described by [[Formal grammar|syntax rules]] that fix a language for the expressions, types, etc. The presentation here of such a syntax is not too formal, in that it is written down not to study the [[Parse tree|surface grammar]], but rather the [[Abstract syntax|depth grammar]], and leaves some syntactical details open. This form of presentation is usual. Building on this, [[type rule]]s are used to define how expressions and types are related. As before, the form used is a bit liberal.

The expressions to be typed are exactly those of the [[lambda calculus]] extended with a let-expression as shown in the adjacent table. Parentheses can be used to disambiguate an expression. The application is left-binding and binds stronger than abstraction or the let-in construct.

Types are syntactically split into two groups, monotypes and polytypes.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Polytypes are called "type schemes" in the original article.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Monotypes ====
Monotypes always designate a particular type. Monotypes &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are syntactically represented as [[Term (logic)|terms]].

Examples of monotypes include type constants like &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{int}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{string}&lt;/math&gt;, and parametric types like &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{Map\ (Set\ string)\ int}&lt;/math&gt;.   The later types are examples of ''applications'' of type functions, for example, from the set
&lt;math&gt; \{ \mathtt{Map^2,\ Set^1,\ string^0,\ int^0},\ \rightarrow^2 \} &lt;/math&gt;, 
where the superscript indicates the number of type parameters.  The complete set of type functions &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is arbitrary in HM,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The parametric types &lt;math&gt;C\ \tau\dots\tau&lt;/math&gt; were not present in the original paper on HM and are not needed to present the method. None of the inference rules below will take care or even note them. The same holds for the non-parametric "primitive types" in said paper. All the machinery for polymorphic type inference can be defined without them. They have been included here for sake of examples but also because the nature of HM is all about parametric types. This comes from the function type &lt;math&gt;\tau\rightarrow\tau&lt;/math&gt;, hard-wired in the inference rules, below, which already has two parameters and has been presented here as only a special case.&lt;/ref&gt; except that it ''must'' contain at least &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow^2&lt;/math&gt;, the type of functions.  It is often written in infix notation for convenience.  For example, a function mapping integers to strings has type &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{int}\rightarrow \mathtt{string}&lt;/math&gt;. Again, parentheses can be used to disambiguate a type expression. The application binds stronger than the infix arrow, which is right-binding.

Type variables are admitted as monotypes. Monotypes are not to be confused with monomorphic types, which exclude variables and allow only ground terms.

Two monotypes are equal if they have identical terms.

==== Polytypes ====
''Polytypes'' (or ''type schemes'') are types containing variables bound by one or more for-all quantifiers, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\forall\alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

A function with polytype &lt;math&gt;\forall\alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha&lt;/math&gt; can map ''any'' value of the same type to itself,
and the [[identity function]] is a value for this type.

As another example &lt;math&gt;\forall\alpha.(\mathtt{Set}\ \alpha)\rightarrow \mathtt{int}&lt;/math&gt; is the type of a function mapping all finite sets to integers. A function which returns the [[cardinality]] of a set would be a value of this type.

Note that quantifiers can only appear top level, i.e. a type &lt;math&gt;\forall\alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\forall\alpha.\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for instance, is excluded by the syntax of types. Note also that monotypes are included in the polytypes, thus a type has the general form &lt;math&gt;\forall\alpha_1\dots\forall\alpha_n.\tau&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is a monotype.

Equality of polytypes is up to reordering the quantification and renaming the quantified variables (&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-conversion). Further, quantified variables not occurring in the monotype can be dropped.

==== Context and Typing ====

To meaningfully bring together the still disjoint parts (syntax expressions and types) a third part is needed: context. Syntactically, a context is a list of pairs &lt;math&gt;x:\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, called [[Assignment (mathematical logic)|assignments]], [[:wikt:assumption|assumptions]] or [[Name binding|bindings]], each pair stating that value variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i&lt;/math&gt;. All three parts combined give a ''typing judgment'' of the form &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\ \vdash\ e:\sigma&lt;/math&gt;,
stating that under assumptions &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, the expression &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Free type variables ====

In a type &lt;math&gt;\forall\alpha_1\dots\forall\alpha_n.\tau&lt;/math&gt;, the symbol &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; is the quantifier binding the type variables &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; in the monotype &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. The variables &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; are called ''quantified'' and any occurrence of a quantified type variable in &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is called ''bound'' and all unbound type variables in &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are called ''free''. Additionally to the quantification &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; in polytypes, type variables can also be bound by occurring in the context, but with the inverse effect on the right hand side of the &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt;. Such variables then behave like type constants there. Finally, a type variable may legally occur unbound in a typing, in which case they are implicitly all-quantified.

The presence of both bound and unbound type variables is a bit uncommon in programming languages. Often, all type variables are implicitly treated all-quantified. For instance, one does not have clauses with free variables in [[Prolog]]. Likely in Haskell, in the absence of the ScopedTypeVariables language extension, all type variables implicitly occur quantified, i.e. a Haskell type &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt; means &lt;math&gt;\forall\alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha&lt;/math&gt; here.

=== Type order ===
{{main|Unification (computer science)#Substitution}}

Polymorphism means that one and the same expression can have (perhaps
infinitely) many types. But in this type system, these types are not completely
unrelated, but rather orchestrated by the parametric polymorphism.

As an example, the identity &lt;math&gt;\lambda x . x&lt;/math&gt; can have &lt;math&gt;\forall
\alpha . \alpha \rightarrow \alpha&lt;/math&gt; as its type as well as
&lt;math&gt;\texttt{string} \rightarrow \texttt{string}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\texttt{int}
\rightarrow \texttt{int}&lt;/math&gt; and many others, but not &lt;math&gt;\texttt{int}
\rightarrow \texttt{string}&lt;/math&gt;. The most general type for this function is
&lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha . \alpha\rightarrow \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, while the
others are more specific and can be derived from the general one by consistently
replacing another type for the ''type parameter'', i.e. the quantified
variable &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  The counter-example fails because the
replacement is not consistent.

The consistent replacement can be made formal by applying a [[Unification (computer science)#Substitution|substitution]] &lt;math&gt;S = \left\{\ a_i \mapsto \tau_i,\ \dots\ \right\}&lt;/math&gt; to the term of a type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, written &lt;math&gt;S\tau&lt;/math&gt;. As the example suggests, substitution is not only strongly related to an order, that expresses that a type is more or less special, but also with the all-quantification which allows the substitution to be applied.

{| class=infobox
|align=center style="background:#e0e0ff"|'''Specialization Rule'''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\frac{\tau' = \left\{\alpha_i \mapsto \tau_i\right\} \tau \quad \beta_i \not\in \textrm{free}(\forall \alpha_1...\forall\alpha_n . \tau)}{\forall \alpha_1...\forall\alpha_n . \tau \sqsubseteq \forall \beta_1...\forall\beta_m . \tau'}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Formally, in HM, a type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is 
more general than &lt;math&gt;\sigma'&lt;/math&gt;, formally &lt;math&gt;\sigma \sqsubseteq
\sigma'&lt;/math&gt; if some quantified variable in &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is
consistently substituted such that one gains &lt;math&gt;\sigma'&lt;/math&gt; as shown in the side bar.
This order is part of the type definition of the type system.

While substituting a monomorphic (ground) type for a quantified variable is
straight forward, substituting a polytype has some pitfalls caused by the
presence of free variables. Most particularly, unbound variables must not be
replaced. They are treated as constants here. Additionally, note
that quantifications can only occur top-level. Substituting a parametric type,
one has to lift its quantors. The table on the right makes the rule precise.

Alternatively, consider an equivalent notation for the polytypes without
quantors in which quantified variables are represented by a different set of
symbols. In such a notation, the specialization reduces to plain consistent
replacement of such variables.

The relation &lt;math&gt;\sqsubseteq&lt;/math&gt; is a [[partial order]]
and  &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha . \alpha&lt;/math&gt; is its smallest element.

==== Principal type ====
While specialization of a type scheme is one use of the order, it plays a
crucial second role in the type system. Type inference with polymorphism
faces the challenge of summarizing all possible types an expression may have.
The order guarantees that such a summary exists as the most general type
of the expression.

==== Substitution in typings ====

The type order defined above can be extended to typings because the implied all-quantification of typings enables consistent replacement:
:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma \vdash e : \sigma \quad\Longrightarrow\quad S\Gamma \vdash e : S\sigma
&lt;/math&gt;
Contrary to the specialisation rule, this is not part of the definition, but like the implicit all-quantification rather a consequence of the type rules defined next.
Free type variables in a typing serve as placeholders for possible refinement. The binding effect of the environment to free type
variables on the right hand side of &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; that prohibits their substitution in the specialisation rule is again
that a replacement has to be consistent and would need to include the whole typing.

=== Deductive system ===
{| class=infobox
|align=center style="background:#e0e0ff"|'''The Syntax of Rules'''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lrl}
  \text{Predicate}  &amp; =      &amp;\sigma\sqsubseteq\sigma'\\
                    &amp; \vert\ &amp;\alpha\not\in free(\Gamma)\\
                    &amp; \vert\ &amp;x:\alpha\in \Gamma\\
\\
  \text{Judgment}   &amp; =      &amp;\text{Typing}\\
  \text{Premise}    &amp; =      &amp;\text{Judgment}\ \vert\ \text{Predicate}\\
  \text{Conclusion} &amp; =      &amp;\text{Judgment}\\
\\
  \text{Rule}       &amp; =      &amp;\displaystyle\frac{\textrm{Premise}\ \dots}{\textrm{Conclusion}}\quad [\mathtt{Name}]
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The syntax of HM is carried forward to the syntax of the [[Rule of inference|inference rules]] that form the body of the [[formal system]], by using the typings as [[Judgment (mathematical logic)|judgments]]. Each of the rules define what conclusion could be drawn from what premises. Additionally to the judgments, some extra conditions introduced above might be used as premises, too.

A proof using the rules is a sequence of judgments such that all premises are listed before a conclusion. The examples below show a possible format of proofs. From left to right, each line shows the conclusion, the &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Name}]&lt;/math&gt; of the rule applied and the premises, either by referring to an earlier line (number) if the premise is a judgment or by making the predicate explicit.

==== Typing rules ====
{{see also|Type rules}}
{| class=infobox
|align=center style="background:#e0e0ff"|'''Declarative Rule System'''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{cl}
 \displaystyle\frac{x:\sigma \in \Gamma}{\Gamma \vdash_D x:\sigma}&amp;[\mathtt{Var}]\\ \\
 \displaystyle\frac{\Gamma \vdash_D e_0:\tau \rightarrow \tau' \quad\quad \Gamma \vdash_D e_1 : \tau }{\Gamma \vdash_D e_0\ e_1 : \tau'}&amp;[\mathtt{App}]\\ \\

 \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The side box shows the deduction rules of the HM type system. One can roughly divide the rules into two groups:

The first four rules &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Var}]&lt;/math&gt; (variable or function access), &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{App}]&lt;/math&gt; (''application'', i.e. function call with one parameter), &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Abs}]&lt;/math&gt; (''abstraction'', i.e. function declaration) and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Let}]&lt;/math&gt; (variable declaration) are centered around the syntax, presenting one rule for each of the expression forms. Their meaning is obvious at the first glance, as they decompose each expression, prove their sub-expressions and finally combine the individual types found in the premises to the type in the conclusion.

The second group is formed by the  remaining two rules &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Inst}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Gen}]&lt;/math&gt;.
They handle specialization and generalization of types. While the rule &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Inst}]&lt;/math&gt; should be clear from the section on specialization above, &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Gen}]&lt;/math&gt; complements the former, working in the opposite direction. It allows generalization, i.e. to quantify monotype variables not bound in the context.
 
The following two examples exercise the rule system in action. Since both the expression and the type are given, they are a type-checking use of the rules.

'''Example''': A proof for &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash_D id(n):int&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = id:\forall \alpha . \alpha\rightarrow\alpha,\ n:int&lt;/math&gt;,
could be written

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{llll}
1:&amp;\Gamma \vdash_D id : \forall\alpha.\alpha \rightarrow \alpha  &amp;[\mathtt{Var}]&amp; (id : \forall\alpha.\alpha \rightarrow \alpha \in \Gamma) \\
2:&amp;\Gamma \vdash_D id : int \rightarrow int &amp; [\mathtt{Inst}]&amp;(1),\ (\forall\alpha.\alpha \rightarrow \alpha \sqsubseteq int\rightarrow int)\\
3:&amp;\Gamma \vdash_D n : int&amp;[\mathtt{Var}]&amp;(n : int \in \Gamma)\\
4:&amp;\Gamma \vdash_D id(n) : int&amp;[\mathtt{App}]&amp; (2),\ (3)\\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example''': To demonstrate generalization,
&lt;math&gt;\vdash_D\ \textbf{let}\, id = \lambda x . x\ \textbf{in}\ id\, :\, \forall\alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha&lt;/math&gt;
is shown below:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{llll}
1: &amp; x:\alpha \vdash_D x : \alpha &amp; [\mathtt{Var}] &amp; (x:\alpha \in \left\{x:\alpha\right\})\\
2: &amp; \vdash_D \lambda x.x : \alpha\rightarrow\alpha &amp; [\mathtt{Abs}] &amp; (1)\\
3: &amp; \vdash_D \lambda x.x : \forall \alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha &amp; [\mathtt{Gen}] &amp; (2),\ (\alpha \not\in free(\epsilon))\\
4: &amp; id:\forall \alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha \vdash_D id : \forall \alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha &amp; [\mathtt{Var}] &amp; (id:\forall \alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha \in \left\{id : \forall \alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha\right\})\\
5: &amp; \vdash_D \textbf{let}\, id = \lambda x . x\ \textbf{in}\  id\, :\,\forall\alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha  &amp; [\mathtt{Let}] &amp; (3),\ (4)\\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Let-polymorphism ===
Not visible immediately, the rule set encodes a regulation under which circumstances a type might be generalized or not by a slightly varying use of mono- and polytypes in the rules &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Abs}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Let}]&lt;/math&gt;. Remember that &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; denote poly- and monotypes respectively.

In rule &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Abs}]&lt;/math&gt;, the value variable of the parameter of the function &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.e&lt;/math&gt; is added to the context with a monomorphic type through the premise &lt;math&gt;\Gamma,\ x:\tau \vdash_D e:\tau'&lt;/math&gt;, while in the rule  &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Let}]&lt;/math&gt;, the variable enters the environment in polymorphic form &lt;math&gt;\Gamma,\ x:\sigma \vdash_D e_1:\tau&lt;/math&gt;. Though in both cases the presence of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the context prevents the use of the generalisation rule for any free variable in the assignment, this regulation forces the type of parameter &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in a &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-expression to remain monomorphic, while in a let-expression, the variable could be introduced polymorphic, making specializations possible.

As a consequence of this regulation, &lt;math&gt;\lambda f.(f\, \textrm{true}, f\, \textrm{0})&lt;/math&gt; cannot be typed,
since the parameter &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is in a monomorphic position, while &lt;math&gt;\textbf{let}\ f = \lambda x . x\, \textbf{in}\, (f\, \textrm{true}, f\, \textrm{0})&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;(bool, int)&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has been introduced in a let-expression and is treated polymorphic therefore.

===Generalization rule===

The generalisation rule is also worth for closer look. Here, the all-quantification implicit in the premise &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e : \sigma&lt;/math&gt; is simply moved to the right hand side of &lt;math&gt;\vdash_D&lt;/math&gt; in the conclusion. This is possible, since &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; does not occur free in the context. Again, while this makes the generalisation rule plausible, it is not really a consequence. Vis versa, the generalisation rule is part of the definition of HM's type system and the implicit all-quantification a consequence.

== An inference algorithm ==
Now that the deduction system of HM is at hand, one could present an algorithm and validate it with respect to the rules.
Alternatively, it might be possible to derive it by taking a closer look on how the rules interact and proof are
formed. This is done in the remainder of this article focusing on the possible decisions one can make while proving a typing.

=== Degrees of freedom choosing the rules ===
Isolating the points in a proof, where no decision is possible at all,
the first group of rules centered around the syntax leaves no choice since
to each syntactical rule corresponds a unique typing rule, which determines
a part of the proof, while between the conclusion and the premises of these
fixed parts chains of &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Inst}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Gen}]&lt;/math&gt;
could occur. Such a chain could also exist between the conclusion of the
proof and the rule for topmost expression. All proofs must have
the so sketched shape.

Because the only choice in a proof with respect of rule selection are the
&lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Inst}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Gen}]&lt;/math&gt; chains, the
form of the proof suggests the question whether it can be made more precise,
where these chains might be needed. This is in fact possible and leads to a
variant of the rules system with no such rules.

A contemporary treatment of HM uses a purely [[syntax-directed]] rule system due to
Clement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Clement | date = 1986 | title = A Simple Applicative Language: Mini-ML | conference = LFP'86 | publisher = ACM}}&lt;/ref&gt;
as an intermediate step. In this system, the specialization is located directly after the original &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Var}]&lt;/math&gt; rule
and merged into it, while the generalization becomes part of the &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Let}]&lt;/math&gt; rule. There the generalization is
also determined to always produce the most general type by introducing the function &lt;math&gt;\bar{\Gamma}(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;, which quantifies
all monotype variables not bound in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

Formally, to validate, that this new rule system &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the original &lt;math&gt;\vdash_D&lt;/math&gt;, one has
to show that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash_D\ e:\sigma \Leftrightarrow \Gamma \vdash_S\ e:\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, which falls apart into two sub-proofs:

* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash_D\ e:\sigma \Leftarrow \Gamma \vdash_S\ e:\sigma&lt;/math&gt; ([[Consistency]])
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash_D\ e:\sigma \Rightarrow \Gamma \vdash_S\ e:\sigma&lt;/math&gt; ([[Completeness (logic)|Completeness]])

While consistency can be seen by decomposing the rules &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Let}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Var}]&lt;/math&gt;
of &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt; into proofs in &lt;math&gt;\vdash_D&lt;/math&gt;, it is likely visible that &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt; is incomplete, as
one cannot show &lt;math&gt;\lambda\ x.x:\forall\alpha.\alpha\rightarrow\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt;, for instance, but only
&lt;math&gt;\lambda\ x.x:\alpha\rightarrow\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  An only slightly weaker version of completeness is provable

* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash_D\ e:\sigma \Rightarrow \Gamma \vdash_S\ e:\tau \wedge \bar{\Gamma}(\tau)\sqsubseteq\sigma&lt;/math&gt;

implying, one can derive the principal type for an expression in &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt; allowing us to generalize the proof in the end.

Comparing &lt;math&gt;\vdash_D&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt;, note that now only monotypes appear in the judgments of all rules. Additionally, the shape of any possible proof with the deduction system is now identical to the shape of the expression (both seen as [[Term (logic)#Formal definition|trees]]). Thus the expression fully determines the shape of the proof. In &lt;math&gt;\vdash_D&lt;/math&gt; the shape would likely be determined with respect to all rules except &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Inst}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Gen}]&lt;/math&gt;, which allow building arbitrarily long branches (chains) between the other nodes.

=== Degrees of freedom instantiating the rules ===

Now that the shape of the proof is known, one is already close to formulating a type inference algorithm.
Because any proof for a given expression must have the same shape, one can assume the monotypes in the
proof's judgements to be undetermined and consider how to determine them.

Here, the substitution (specialisation) order comes into play. Although at the first glance one cannot determine the types locally, the hope is that it is possible to refine them with the help of the order while traversing the proof tree, additionally assuming, because the resulting algorithm is to become an inference method, that the type in any premise will be determined as the best possible. And in fact, one can, as looking at the rules of &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt; suggests:

* &lt;math&gt;[Abs]&lt;/math&gt;: The critical choice is &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. At this point, nothing is known about &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, so one can only assume the most general type, which is &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha . \alpha&lt;/math&gt;. The plan is to specialize the type if it should become necessary. Unfortunately, a polytype is not permitted in this place, so some &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; has to do for the moment. To avoid unwanted captures, a type variable not yet in the proof is a safe choice. Additionally, one has to keep in mind that this monotype is not yet fixed, but might be further refined.
* &lt;math&gt;[Var]&lt;/math&gt;: The choice is how to refine &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Because any choice of a type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; here depends on the usage of the variable, which is not locally known, the safest bet is the most general one. Using the same method as above one can instantiate all quantified variables in &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; with fresh monotype variables, again keeping them open to further refinement.
* &lt;math&gt;[Let]&lt;/math&gt;: The rule does not leave any choice. Done.
* &lt;math&gt;[App]&lt;/math&gt;: Only the application rule might force a refinement to the variables "opened" so far.

The first premise forces the outcome of the inference to be of the form &lt;math&gt;\tau \rightarrow \tau'&lt;/math&gt;.
* If it is, then fine. One can later pick its &lt;math&gt;\tau'&lt;/math&gt; for the result.
* If not, it might be an open variable. Then this can be refined to the required form with two new variables as before.
* Otherwise, the type checking fails because the first premise inferred a type which is not and cannot be made into a function type.

The second premise requires that the inferred type is equal to &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; of the first premise. Now there are two possibly different types, perhaps with open type variables, at hand to compare and to make equal if it is possible. If it is, a refinement is found, and if not, a type error is detected again. An effective method is known to "make two terms equal" by substitution, [[John Alan Robinson|Robinson's]] [[Unification (computing)|Unification]] in combination with the so-called [[Disjoint-set data structure|Union-Find]] algorithm.

To briefly summarize the union-find algorithm, given the set of all types in a proof, it allows one to group them together into [[equivalence class]]es by means of a &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{union}&lt;/math&gt;
procedure and to pick a representative for each such class using a &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{find}&lt;/math&gt; procedure. Emphasizing the word [[Procedure (computer science)|procedure]] in the sense of [[Side effect (computer science)|side effect]], we're clearly leaving the realm of logic in order to prepare an effective algorithm. The representative of a &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{union}(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; is determined such that, if both &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are type variables then the representative is arbitrarily one of them, but while uniting a variable and a term, the term becomes the representative. Assuming an implementation of union-find at hand, one can formulate the unification of two monotypes as follows:

 unify(ta,tb):
   ta = find(ta)
   tb = find(tb)
   '''if''' both ta,tb are terms of the form D p1..pn with identical D,n '''then'''
     unify(ta[i],tb[i]) for each corresponding ''i''th parameter
   '''else'''
   '''if''' at least one of ta,tb is a type variable '''then'''
     union(ta,tb)
   '''else'''
     error 'types do not match'

Now having a sketch of an inference algorithm at hand, a more formal presentation is given in the next section. It is described in Milner&lt;ref name="Milner"/&gt; P. 370 ff. as algorithm J.

=== Algorithm J ===
{| class=infobox
|align=center style="background:#e0e0ff"|'''Algorithm J'''

\begin{array}{cl}
\displaystyle\frac{x:\sigma \in \Gamma \quad \tau = \mathit{inst}(\sigma)}{\Gamma \vdash_J x:\tau}&amp;[\mathtt{Var}]\\ \\
\displaystyle\frac{\Gamma \vdash_J e_0:\tau_0 \quad \Gamma \vdash_J e_1 : \tau_1 \quad \tau'=\mathit{newvar} \quad \mathit{unify}(\tau_0,\ \tau_1 \rightarrow \tau') }{\Gamma \vdash_J e_0\ e_1 : \tau'}&amp;[\mathtt{App}]\\ \\

\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The presentation of Algorithm J is a misuse of the notation of logical rules, since it includes side effects but allows a direct comparison with &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt; while expressing an efficient implementation at the same time. The rules now specify a procedure with parameters &lt;math&gt;\Gamma, e&lt;/math&gt; yielding &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; in the conclusion where the execution of the premises proceeds from left to right.

The procedure &lt;math&gt;inst(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; specializes the polytype &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; by copying the term and replacing the bound type variables consistently by new monotype variables. '&lt;math&gt;newvar&lt;/math&gt;' produces a new monotype variable. Likely, &lt;math&gt;\bar{\Gamma}(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; has to copy the type introducing new variables for the quantification to avoid unwanted captures. Overall, the algorithm now proceeds by always making the most general choice leaving the specialization to the unification, which by itself produces the most general result. As noted [[#Syntax driven Rule System|above]], the final result &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; has to be generalized to &lt;math&gt;\bar{\Gamma}(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; in the end, to gain the most general type for a given expression.

Because the procedures used in the algorithm have nearly O(1) cost, the overall cost of the algorithm is close to linear in the size of the expression for which a type is to be inferred. This is in strong contrast to many other attempts to derive type inference algorithms, which often came out to be [[NP-hard]], if not [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] with respect to termination. Thus the HM performs as well as the best fully informed type-checking algorithms can. Type-checking here means that an algorithm does not have to find a proof, but only to validate a given one.

Efficiency is slightly reduced because the binding of type variables in the context has to be maintained to allow computation of &lt;math&gt;\bar{\Gamma}(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; and enable an [[occurs check]] to prevent the building of recursive types during &lt;math&gt;union(\alpha,\tau)&lt;/math&gt;.
An example of such a case is &lt;math&gt;\lambda\ x.(x\ x)&lt;/math&gt;, for which no type can be derived using HM.  Practically, types are only small terms and do not build up expanding structures.  Thus, in complexity analysis, one can treat comparing them as a constant, retaining O(1) costs.

==Proving the algorithm==

In the previous section, while sketching the algorithm its proof was hinted at with metalogical argumentation.  While this leads to an efficient algorithm J, it is
not clear whether the algorithm properly reflects the deduction systems D or S
which serve as a semantic base line.

The most critical point in the above argumentation is the refinement of monotype
variables bound by the context. For instance, the algorithm boldly changes the
context while inferring e.g. &lt;math&gt;\lambda f . (f\ 1)&lt;/math&gt;,
because the monotype variable added to the context for the parameter &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; later needs to be refined
to &lt;math&gt;int \rightarrow \beta&lt;/math&gt; when handling application.
The problem is that the deduction rules do not allow such a refinement.
Arguing that the refined type could have been added earlier instead of the
monotype variable is an expedient at best.

The key to reaching a formally satisfying argument is to properly include
the context within the refinement. Formally,
typing is compatible with substitution of free type variables.

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash_S e : \tau \quad\Longrightarrow\quad S \Gamma \vdash_S e : S \tau&lt;/math&gt;

To refine the free variables thus means to refine the whole typing.

=== Algorithm W ===
{| class=infobox
|align=center style="background:#e0e0ff"|'''Algorithm W'''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{cl}
\displaystyle\frac{x:\sigma \in \Gamma \quad \tau = \mathit{inst}(\sigma)}{\Gamma \vdash_W x:\tau,\emptyset}&amp;[\mathtt{Var}]\\ \\
\displaystyle\frac{\begin{array}{ll}\Gamma \vdash_W e_0 : \tau_0, S_0 &amp; S_0 \Gamma \vdash_W e_1 : \tau_1, S_1\\ \tau'=\mathit{newvar} &amp; S_2 = \mathsf{mgu}(S_1 \tau_0,\ \tau_1 \rightarrow \tau')\end{array} }{\Gamma \vdash_W e_0\ e_1 : S_2 \tau', S_2 S_1 S_0}&amp;[\mathtt{App}]\\ \\

\end{array}

&lt;/math&gt;
|}
From there, a proof of algorithm J leads to algorithm W, which only makes the
side effects imposed by the procedure &lt;math&gt;\textit{union}&lt;/math&gt; explicit by
expressing its serial composition by means of the substitutions
&lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt;. The presentation of algorithm W in the sidebar still makes use of side effects
in the operations set in italic, but these are now limited to generating
fresh symbols. The form of judgement is &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e : \tau, S&lt;/math&gt;,
denoting a function with a context and expression as parameter producing a monotype together with
a substitution. &lt;math&gt;\textsf{mgu}&lt;/math&gt; is a side-effect free version
of &lt;math&gt;\textit{union}&lt;/math&gt; producing a substitution which is the [[Unification (computer science)#Syntactic unification of first-order terms|most general unifier]].

While algorithm W is normally considered to be ''the'' HM algorithm and is
often directly presented after the rule system in literature, its purpose is
described by Milner&lt;ref name="Milner"/&gt; on P. 369 as follows:

: ''As it stands, W is hardly an efficient algorithm; substitutions are applied too often. It was formulated to aid the proof of soundness. We now present a simpler algorithm J which simulates W in a precise sense.''

While he considered W more complicated and less efficient, he presented it 
in his publication before J. It has its merits when side effects are unavailable or unwanted.
By the way, W is also needed to prove completeness, which is factored by him into the soundness proof.

=== Proof obligations ===

Before formulating the proof obligations, a deviation between the rules systems
D and S and the algorithms presented needs to be emphasized.

While the development above sort of misused the monotypes as "open" proof variables, the possibility that proper monotype variables might be harmed was sidestepped by introducing fresh variables and hoping for the best. But there's a catch: One of the promises made was that these fresh variables would be "kept in mind" as such. This promise is not fulfilled by the algorithm.

Having a context &lt;math&gt;1 : int,\ f : \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the expression &lt;math&gt;f\ 1&lt;/math&gt;
cannot be typed in either &lt;math&gt;\vdash_D&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt;, but the algorithms come up with
the type &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, where W additionally delivers the substitution &lt;math&gt;\left\{\alpha \mapsto int \rightarrow \beta\right\}&lt;/math&gt;,
meaning that the algorithm fails to detect all type errors. This omission can easily be fixed by more carefully distinguishing proof
variables and monotype variables.

The authors were well aware of the problem but decided not to fix it. One might assume a pragmatic reason behind this.
While more properly implementing the type inference would have enabled the algorithm to deal with abstract monotypes,
they were not needed for the intended application where none of the items in a preexisting context have free
variables. In this light, the unneeded complication was dropped in favor of a simpler algorithm.
The remaining downside is that the proof of the algorithm with respect to the rule system is less general and can only be made
for contexts with &lt;math&gt;free(\Gamma) = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; as a side condition.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lll}
\text{(Correctness)}  &amp;\Gamma |-_W e : \tau, S &amp;\quad\Longrightarrow\quad \Gamma \vdash_S e : \tau \\
\text{(Completeness)} &amp;\Gamma |-_S e : \tau   &amp;\quad\Longrightarrow\quad  \Gamma \vdash_W e : \tau', S \quad\quad \text{forall}\ \tau\ \text{where}\ \overline\emptyset(\tau') \sqsubseteq \tau
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

The side condition in the completeness obligation addresses how the deduction may give many types, while the algorithm always produces one. At the same time, the side condition demands that the type inferred is actually the most general.

To properly prove the obligations one needs to strengthen them first to allow activating the substitution lemma threading the substitution &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;\vdash_S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vdash_W&lt;/math&gt;. From there, the proofs are by induction over the expression.

Another proof obligation is the substitution lemma itself, i.e. the substitution of the typing, which finally establishes the all-quantification. The later cannot formally be proven, since no such syntax is at hand.

== Extensions ==

=== Recursive definitions ===

To make [[Turing completeness|programming practical]] recursive functions are needed.
A central property of the lambda calculus is that recursive definitions
are not directly available, but can instead be expressed with a [[fixed point combinator]].
But unfortunately, the fixpoint combinator cannot be formulated in a typed version
of the lambda calculus without having a disastrous effect on the system as outlined
below.

==== Typing rule ====

The original paper&lt;ref name="Damas"/&gt; notes that recursion can be realized by a combinator
&lt;math&gt;\mathit{fix}:\forall\alpha.(\alpha\rightarrow\alpha)\rightarrow\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. A possible recursive definition could thus be formulated as
&lt;math&gt;\mathtt{rec}\ v = e_1\ \mathtt{in}\ e_2\ ::=\mathtt{let}\ v = \mathit{fix}(\lambda v.e_1)\ \mathtt{in}\ e_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Alternatively an extension of the expression syntax and an extra typing rule is possible:

: &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\frac{
\Gamma, \Gamma' \vdash e_1:\tau_1\quad\dots\quad\Gamma, \Gamma' \vdash e_n:\tau_n\quad\Gamma, \Gamma'' \vdash e:\tau
}{
\Gamma\ \vdash\ \mathtt{rec}\ v_1 = e_1\ \mathtt{and}\ \dots\ \mathtt{and}\ v_n = e_n\ \mathtt{in}\ e:\tau
}\quad[\mathtt{Rec}]&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma' = v_1:\tau_1,\ \dots,\ v_n:\tau_n&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma'' = v_1:\bar\Gamma(\ \tau_1\ ),\ \dots,\ v_n:\bar\Gamma(\ \tau_n\ )&lt;/math&gt;
basically merging &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Abs}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\mathtt{Let}]&lt;/math&gt; while including the recursively defined
variables in monotype positions where they occur to the left of the &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{in}&lt;/math&gt; but as polytypes to the right of it. This
formulation perhaps best summarizes the essence of [[#Let-polymorphism|let-polymorphism]].

==== Consequences ====

While the above is straightforward it does come at a price.

[[Type theory]] connects lambda calculus computation and logic.
The easy modification above has effects on both:

* The [[Normalization property (abstract rewriting)|strong normalisation property]] is spoiled.
* The logic [[Consistency|collapses]].

Programs in simply typed lambda calculus are guaranteed to always terminate. Moreover, they
are even guaranteed to terminate under any evaluation strategy, be it top down, bottom up, breadth first, whatever. The same is true for expressions that have types in HM. It is well-known that separating
terminating from non-terminating programs is most difficult, and especially in lambda calculus,
which is so expressive that it can formulate recursion with just a few symbols. Thus the initial
inability of HM to provide recursive functions was not an omission, but a feature. Adding
recursion enables normal programming but the guarantee is not longer valid.

Another reading of the typing is given by the [[Curry–Howard isomorphism]]. Here
the types are interpreted as logical expressions. Let's look at the type of the fixpoint combinator from this
perspective, assuming the variables to have logical value:
: &lt;math&gt;
(\alpha \rightarrow \alpha) \rightarrow \alpha  \quad\Leftrightarrow\quad 
\textsf{true} \rightarrow \alpha  \quad\Leftrightarrow\quad  \alpha
&lt;/math&gt;
But this is [[Validity (logic)|invalid]].
Adding an invalid axiom will break the logic in the sense that
every formula can then be shown to be true in it, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\text{true} \Leftrightarrow \text{false}&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus the ability to distinguish even two simple things is no longer given. Everything is the same and
collapses into [[Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything|42]]. The fixpoint
combinator that came in so handy above also plays a role in [[Curry's paradox#Lambda calculus|Curry's paradox]].

Logic aside, does this matter for typing programs? It does. Since one is now able to formulate
non-terminating functions, one can make a function that would return whatever one wants&lt;ref group="note"&gt;
To make a function that works just like [[Aladdin]]'s wonderful lamp, one can define: &lt;math&gt;\text{iwisha} \equiv \text{fix id}&lt;/math&gt;
and formulate the wish in a slightly more expressive type language like: "(iwisha ([[flying carpet]]))" passing the type explicitly as
in the introduction. When the function returns, it delivers the wish, but no longer as a type (i.e. specification), but as something
real, a value of that type. This implementation at least does not return. Many have dreamed of such a useful device, and if it exists it could do wonders even if only in computing. The type &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha.\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is so general, that its values belong to the realm of imagination.&lt;/ref&gt; but never really returns:
: &lt;math&gt;\text{fix}\ \text{id} : \forall a . a&lt;/math&gt;.
In practical programming such a function can come in handy when breaking out of a computation,
like with &lt;code&gt;exit(1)&lt;/code&gt; in [[C (programming language)|C]], while silencing the type checker in
the current branch by returning essentially nothing but with a suitable type.

Less desirable is that the type checker (type inferencer) now succeeds with a type for a function that in fact never returns any value, like &lt;math&gt;\text{fix}\ \text{id}&lt;/math&gt;. The function ''would'' return a value of this type, but it ''cannot'' because no terminating function with this type exists. The type checker's claim that everything is ok thus has to be taken with a grain of salt. The types might only be ''claimed'' to be checked, but the program can still be typed wrong. Only if all functions are terminating does &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in the logic above have a ''true'' value, and the assertions of the type checker become strong again.

=== Overloading ===

{{main|Type class}}

Overloading means, that different functions still can be defined and used with the same name. Most programming languages at least provide overloading with the built-in arithmetic operations (+,&lt;,etc.), to allow the programmer to write arithmetic expressions in the same form, even for different numerical types like &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;real&lt;/code&gt;. Because a mixture of these different types within the same expression also demands for implicit conversion, overloading especially for these operations is often built into the programming language itself. In some languages, this feature is generalized and made available to the user, e.g. in C++.

While [[Ad hoc polymorphism|ad-hoc overloading]] has been avoided in functional programming for the computation costs both in type checking and inference{{Citation needed|reasoning=I remember Huet wrote an article on this topic|date=June 2018}}, a means to systematise overloading has been introduced that resembles both in form and naming to object oriented programming, but works one level upwards. "Instances" in this systematic are not objects (i.e. on value level), but rather types.
The quicksort example mentioned in the introduction uses the overloading in the orders, having the following type annotation in Haskell:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
quickSort :: Ord a =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
&lt;/source&gt;
Herein, the type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is not only polymorphic, but also restricted to be an instance of some type class &lt;code&gt;Ord&lt;/code&gt;, that provides the order predicates &lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; used in the functions body. The proper implementations of these predicates are then passed to quicksorts as additional parameters, as soon as quicksort is used on more concrete types providing a single implementation of the overloaded function quickSort.

Because the "classes" only allow a single type as their argument, the resulting type system can still provide inference. Additionally, the type classes can then be equipped with some kind of overloading order allowing one to arrange the classes as a [[Lattice (order)|lattice]].

=== Meta types ===

{{main|Type_class#Higher-kinded_polymorphism}}

Parametric polymorphism implies that types themselves are passed as parameters as if they were proper values. Passed as arguments into a proper functions as in the introduction, but also into "type functions" as in the "parametric" type constants, leads to the question how to more properly type types themselves. A meta type,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;
The term "higher-order" has been so overused, that "meta type" is preferred here.
&lt;/ref&gt; the "type of types" would be useful to create an even more expressive type system.

Though this would be a straight forward extension, unfortunately, only [[Unification (computer science)#Higher-order unification|unification]] is not longer decidable in the presence of meta types, rendering type inference impossible in this extend of generality.
Additionally, assuming a type of all types that includes itself as type leads into a paradox, as in the set of all sets, so one must proceed in steps of levels of abstraction.
Research in [[second order lambda calculus]], one step upwards, showed, that type inference is undecidable in this generality.

Parts of one extra level has been introduced into Haskell named [[Kind (type theory)|kind]], where it is used helping to type [[Monad (functional programming)|monads]]. Kinds are left implicit, working behind scene in the inner mechanics of the extended type system.

=== Subtyping ===

{{main|Subtyping}}

Attempts to combine subtyping and type inference have caused quite some frustration. While type inference is needed in object-oriented programming for the same reason as in functional languages, methods like HM cannot be made going for this purpose.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} It is not difficult to setup a type system with subtyping enabling object-oriented style, as
e.g. [[Cardelli]]

&lt;/ref&gt; shows in [[System F-sub|his system]] &lt;math&gt;F_{&lt;:}&lt;/math&gt;.

* The type equivalence can be broken up into a subtyping relation "&lt;:".
* Extra type rules define this relation e.g. for the [[Subtyping#Function types|functions]].
* A suiting [[Subtyping#Record types|record type]] is then added whose values represent the objects.

Such objects would be immutual in a functional language context, but the type system would enable object-oriented programming style and the type inference method could be reused in imperative languages.

The subtyping rule for the record types is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\displaystyle\frac{
n \le m\quad\quad \tau_1 &lt;: \tau_1' \quad \dots \quad \tau_n &lt;: \tau_n'
}{
\Gamma\ \vdash\ \mathbf{Record}\ v_1 : \tau_1\ \dots\  v_n : \tau_n\ \mathbf{end} &lt;: \mathbf{Record}\ v_1 : \tau_1'\ \dots\  v_m : \tau_m'\ \mathbf{end}
}\quad[\mathtt{Record}]
&lt;/math&gt;
Syntatically, record expressions would have form
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{record}\ v_1 = e_1,\ \dots\ \mathbf{end}&lt;/math&gt;
and have a type rule leading to the above type.
Such record values could then be used the same way as objects in object oriented programming.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13149">{{for|the 1976 book|The Hunting Hypothesis}}
In [[paleoanthropology]], the '''hunting hypothesis''' is the hypothesis that [[human evolution]] was primarily influenced by the activity of [[hunting]] for relatively large and fast animals, and that the activity of  hunting  distinguished human ancestors from other [[hominins]].

While it is undisputed that early humans were hunters, the importance of this fact for the final steps in the emergence of the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' out of earlier [[australopithecines]], with its [[bipedalism]] and production of [[stone tool]]s (from about 2.5 million years ago), and eventually also [[control of fire]] (from about 1.5 million years ago), are emphasized in the "hunting hypothesis", and de-emphasized in scenarios that stress the [[omnivore]] status of humans as their recipe for success, and [[social interaction]], including [[mating|mating behaviour]] as essential in the emergence of language and culture.

Advocates of the hunting hypothesis tend to believe that [[tool]] use and toolmaking essential to effective hunting were an extremely important part of human evolution, and trace the  [[origin of language]] and [[prehistoric religion|religion]] to a hunting context.

As societal evidence Buss cites that modern tribal population deploy hunting as their primary way of acquiring food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buss|first1=David|title=Evolutionary Psychology: The new Science of the Mind.|date=1999|publisher=Needham Heights: Allyn &amp; Bacon.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aka people|Aka pygmies]] in the [[Central African Republic]] spend 56% of their quest for nourishment hunting, 27% gathering, and 17% processing food. Additionally, the [[!Kung]] in Botswana retain 40% of their calories from hunting and this percentage varies from 20% to 90% depending on the season.&lt;ref name="Buss"&gt;Buss, David M. Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2011. Print. 80&lt;/ref&gt;  For physical evidence Buss first looks to the guts of humans and apes.  The human gut consists mainly of the small [[intestines]], which are responsible for the rapid breakdown of proteins and absorption of nutrients. The ape’s gut is primarily [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], which indicates a vegetarian diet. This structural difference supports the hunting hypothesis in being an evolutionary branching point between modern humans and modern primates. Buss also cites human teeth in that fossilized human teeth have a thin enamel coating with very little heavy wear and tear that would result from a plant diet. The absence of thick enamel also indicates that historically humans have maintained a meat-heavy diet.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt;  Buss notes that the bones of animals human ancestors killed found at Olduvai Gorge have cut marks at strategic points on the bones that indicate tool usage and provide evidence for ancestral butchers.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt;

==Applications ==
===[[Sexual division of labor (evolutionary perspective)]]===
According to the hunting hypothesis, women are preoccupied with pregnancy and dependent children and so do not hunt because it is dangerous and less profitable. Gijsbert Stoet highlights the fact that men are more competent in throwing skills, focused attention, and spatial abilities. (Experiments 1 and 2).&lt;ref name = "Stoet"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stoet | first1 = Gisbert | year = 2011 | title = Sex Differences in Search and Gathering Skills | url = | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 32 | issue = 6| pages = 416–22 | doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2011.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible explanation for women gathering is their inherent prioritization of rearing offspring, which is difficult to uphold if women were hunting.&lt;ref name="Stoet"/&gt;

==Provisioning hypothesis==
===Parental investment===
Buss purports that the hunting hypothesis explains the high level of human male parental investment in offspring as compared to primates. Meat is an economical and condensed food resource in that it can be brought home to feed the young, however it is not efficient to carry low-calorie food across great distances. Thus, the act of hunting and the required transportation of the kill in order to feed offspring is a reasonable explanation for human male provisioning.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt;

===Male coalitions===
Buss suggests that the Hunting hypothesis also explains the advent of strong male coalitions. Although chimpanzees form male-male coalitions, they tend to be temporary and opportunistic. Contrastingly, large game hunters require consistent and coordinated cooperation to succeed in large game hunting. Thus male coalitions were the result of working together to succeed in providing meat for the hunters themselves and their families.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt; Kristen Hawkes suggests further that obtaining resources intended for community consumption increases a male’s fitness by appealing to the male’s society and thus being in the good favor of both males and females. The male relationship would improve hunting success and create alliances for future conflict and the female relationship would improve direct reproductive success.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt; 
Buss proposes alternate explanations of emergence of the strong male coalitions. He suggests that male coalitions may have been the result of group-on-group aggression, defense, and in-group political alliances. This explanation does not support the relationship between male coalitions and hunting.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt;

Hawkes proposes that hunters pursue large game and divide the kill across the group. Hunters compete to divvy up the kill to signal courage, power, generosity, prosocial intent, and dedication. By engaging in these activities, hunters receive reproductive benefits and respect.&lt;ref name = "Nolin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nolin | first1 = David A | year = 2010 | title = Food-Sharing Networks in Lamalera, Indonesia | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513811001188 | journal = Human Nature | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 243–68 | doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2011.11.003| pmc = 3398706 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These reproductive benefits lead to greater reproductive success in more skilled hunters.&lt;ref name = "Nolin"/&gt; Evidence of these hunting goals that do not only benefit the families of the hunters are in the [[Aché people|Ache]] and [[Hadza people|Hadza]] men. Hawkes notes that their hunting techniques are less efficient than alternative methods and are energetically costly, but the men place more importance on displaying their bravery, power, and prosocial intent than on hunting efficiency. This method is different as compared to other societies where hunters retain the control of their kills and signal their intent of sharing. This alternate method aligns with the coalition support hypothesis, in efforts to create and preserve political associations.&lt;ref name = "Nolin"/&gt;

===Reciprocal altruism===
The meat from successful large game hunts are more than what a single hunter can consume. Further, hunting success varies by week. One week a hunter may succeed in hunting large game and the next may return with no meat. In this situation Buss suggests that there are low costs to giving away meat that cannot be eaten by the individual hunter on his own and large benefits from the expectation of the returned favor in a week where his hunting is not successful.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt; Hawkes calls this sharing “tolerated theft” and purports that the benefits of reciprocal altruism stem from the result that families will experience “lower daily variation and higher daily average” in their resources.&lt;ref name = "Hawkes"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkes | first1 = Kristen | year = 1991 | title = Showing Off Tests of an Hypothesis About Men's Foraging Goals | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016230959190011E | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 29–54 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(91)90011-E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provisioning may actually be a form of sexual competition between males for females.&lt;ref name = "Norton"&gt;Larsen, Clark S. "Early Hominid Origins and Evolution: The Roots of Humanity." Chapter 10:. W.W. Norton &amp; Company, n.d. Web. 15 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.wwnorton.com/college/anthro/our-origins2/ch/10/outline.aspx&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkes suggests that male provisioning is a particularly human behavior, which forges the nuclear family.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt; The structure of familial provisioning determines a form of resource distribution. However, Hawkes does acknowledge inconsistencies across societies and contexts such as the fluctuating time courses dedicated to hunting and gathering, which are not directly correlated with return rates, the fact that nutrition value is often chosen over caloric count, and the fact that meat is a more widely spread resource than other resources.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt;

===The show-off hypothesis===
The show-off hypothesis is the concept that more successful men have better mate options. The idea relates back to the fact that meat, the result of hunting expeditions, is a distinct resource in that it comes in large quantities that more often than not the hunter’s own family is not able to consume in a timely manner so that the meat doesn’t go sour.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt; Also the success of hunting is unpredictable whereas berries and fruits, unless there is a drought or a bad bush, are fairly consistent in seasonality. Kristen Hawkes argues that women favor neighbors opting for men who provide the advantageous, yet infrequent meat feasts.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt; These women may profit from alliance and the resulting feasts, especially in times of shortage. Hawkes suggests that it would be beneficial for women to reward men who employ the “show-off strategy” by supporting them in a dispute, caring for their offspring, or providing sexual favors.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt; The benefits women may gain from their alignment lie in favored treatment of the offspring spawned by the show-off from neighbors.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt; Buss echoes and cites Hawke’s thoughts on the show-off’s benefits in sexual access, increased likelihood of having children, and the favorable treatment his children would receive from the other members of the society.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt; Hawkes also suggests that show-offs are more likely to live in large groups and thus be less susceptible to predators.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt; Show-offs gain more benefits from just sharing with their family (classical fitness) in the potential favorable treatment from the community and reciprocal altruism from other members of the community.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt;

Hawkes uses the Ache people of Paraguay as evidence for the Show-off hypothesis. Food acquired by men was more widely distributed across the community and inconsistent resources that came in large quantities when acquired were also more widely shared.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt;

While this is represented in the Ache according to Hawkes, Buss notes that this trend is contradicted in the Hadza who evenly distribute the meat across all members of their population and whose hunters have very little control over the distribution. In the Hadza the show-off hypothesis does not have to do with the resources that result from hunting, but from the prestige and risk that is involved in big game hunting. There are possible circuitous benefits such as protection and defense.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt;  
&lt;!-- The following is not a sentence and does not carry a message - please complete if possible.
Why hunters forge male coalitions, even though the hunter’s personal return rate is lower and hunters eat less of their own kill than other family and community members.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt;--&gt;

'''Jesse Michael Bering''' (born 6 May 1975) is a writer and academic. He is Associate Professor in Science Communication at the [[University of Otago]], as well as a frequent contributor to ''[[Scientific American]]'', ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', and ''[[Das Magazin]]'' (Switzerland). His work has also appeared in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', and ''[[The New Republic]]'', and has been featured on ''[[NPR]]'', the ''[[BBC]]'', ''[[Playboy Radio]]'' and elsewhere.

==Life and career==
Bering is the former director of the Institute of Cognition and Culture at [[Queen's University Belfast]] and began his career as a psychology professor at the [[University of Arkansas]]. After a period as a full-time writer and professor at [[Wells College]], he took up a science communication post at the [[University of Otago]] in 2014.

Bering is notable for his frank and humorous handling of controversial issues in psychological science, especially those dealing with [[human sexuality]]. His ''Scientific American'' blog, ''Bering in Mind,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/bering-in-mind/|title=Bering in Mind - A research psychologist's curious look at human behavior| publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was named a 2010 [[Webby Award]] Honoree for the Blog-Cultural category by members of The [[International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences]]. He also received the 2010 "Scientist of the Year Award" from the [[National Organization of Gay and Lesbian Scientists and Technical Professionals]] (NOGLSTP), an affiliate of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].

He is also a Project Partner in the [[Oxford University]]-based 'Explaining Religion' project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icea.ox.ac.uk/large-grants/explaining-religion/ |title=Explaining Religion Project |publisher=Oxford University, Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology |accessdate=December 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112013032/http://www.icea.ox.ac.uk/large-grants/explaining-religion/ |archivedate=January 12, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a three-year, €2 million project funded by the [[European Commission]].

He attended graduate school at the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]] where he earned his MA degree (1999) studying [[Chimpanzee#Social structure|chimpanzee social cognition]] under the guidance of [[comparative psychologist]] Daniel J. Povinelli. He then transferred to [[Florida Atlantic University]], where he obtained a PhD in [[developmental psychology]] (2002). His doctoral advisor was the [[evolutionary developmental psychologist]] [[David F. Bjorklund]]. Bering's formal academic research is in the area of the [[cognitive science of religion]]. In his book ''Perv: The Sexual Deviant in All of Us'' he has expressed support for [[Virtuous Pedophiles]], an anti-[[child sexual abuse]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rachel Kramer|last=Bussel|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/18/can-pedophiles-help-themselves-a-book-s-provocative-take-on-sexuality.html |title=Can Pedophiles Help Themselves? A Book’s Provocative Take on Sexuality |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=2013-10-18 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Bering is the author of ''The Belief Instinct: The Psychology of Souls, Destiny, and the Meaning of Life'' ([[W. W. Norton]]), ''Why is the Penis Shaped Like That? And Other Reflections on Being Human'' ([[Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux]], released July 3, 2012), ''Perv: The Sexual Deviant in All of Us ''(Farrar, Straus and Giroux, October 8, 2013), and ''Suicidal: Why We Kill Ourselves'' ([[University of Chicago Press]], August 23, 2018). ''The Belief Instinct'' was named one of the top 25 books of 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press_release | url=http://www.ala.org/news/pr?id=8827 | title=Choice editors preview their favorite books and websites of 2011 | publisher=American Library Association | date=December 13, 2011 | accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[American Library Association]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="987">'''Kari''', in [[shakuhachi]] music, is both a property of a note and a technique.  To play a note kari means to play it with raised [[pitch (music)|pitch]], relative to playing the note [[Meri (note)|meri]].  In addition to sharpening the pitch, playing a note kari also modifies the tone color or [[timbre]] of a note.

The usual technique to play a note kari is to raise the chin, increasing the angle and distance between the [[embouchure]] and [[utaguchi]] (blowing edge).

The '''Karl Jaspers Prize''' or '''Karl-Jaspers-Preis''' is a German [[philosophy award]] named after [[Karl Jaspers]] and awarded by the city of [[Heidelberg]] and the [[University of Heidelberg]]. It was first awarded in 1983 "for a scientific work of international significance supported by philosophical spirit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karl-Jaspers-Preis|url=http://www.heidelberg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1149145/index.html|publisher=www.heidelberg.de|accessdate=2 March 2013|quote=Translated from the German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Karl Jaspers Prize is endowed with 5,000 euros. Next to the [[Friedrich Nietzsche Prize]] it is one of the highest awards in Germany awarded exclusively for philosophical achievements.

'''Language and Communication Technologies''' ('''LCT'''; also known as '''''human language technologies''''' or '''''[[language technology]]''''' for short) is the scientific study of technologies that explore language and communication.  It is an interdisciplinary field that encompasses the fields of [[computer science]], [[linguistics]] and [[cognitive science]].

==History==
One of the first problems to be studied in the 1950s, shortly after the invention of computers, was an LCT problem, namely the translation of human languages.  The large amounts of funding poured into [[machine translation]] testifies to the perceived importance of the field, right from the beginning.  It was also in this period that scholars started to develop theories of language and communication based on scientific methods. In the case of language, it was [[Noam Chomsky]] who refines the goal of linguistics as a quest for a formal description of language,&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky, ''Syntactic Structures'', London: Mouton, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; whilst [[Claude Shannon]] and [[Warren Weaver]] provided a mathematical theory that linked communication with information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/paper.html A Mathematical Theory of Communication]. Cm.bell-labs.com (1998-05-18). Retrieved on 2011-03-21. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980131083455/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/paper.html|date=1998-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computers and related technologies have provided a physical and conceptual framework within which scientific studies concerning the notion of communication within a computational framework could be pursued. Indeed, this framework has been fruitful on a number of levels. For a start, it has given birth to a new discipline, known as [[natural language processing]] (NLP), or [[computational linguistics]] (CL). This discipline studies, from a computational perspective, all levels of language from the production of speech to the meanings of texts and dialogues. And over the past 40 years, NLP has produced an impressive computational infrastructure of resources, techniques, and tools for analyzing sound structure ([[phonology]]), word structure ([[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]), grammatical structure ([[syntax]]) and meaning structure ([[semantics]]). As well as being important for language-based applications, this computational infrastructure makes it possible to investigate the structure of human language and communication at a deeper scientific level than was ever previously possible.

Moreover, NLP fits in naturally with other branches of computer science, and in particular, with [[artificial intelligence]] (AI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AITopics/NaturalLanguage AITopics / NaturalLanguage]. Aaai.org. Retrieved on 2011-03-21. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731224551/http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AITopics/NaturalLanguage|date=2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an AI perspective, language use is regarded as a manifestation of intelligent behaviour by an active agent. The emphasis in AI-based approaches to language and communication is on the computational infrastructure required to integrate linguistic performance into a general theory of intelligent agents that includes, for example, learning generalizations on the basis of particular experience, the ability to plan and reason about intentionally produced utterances, the design of utterances that will fulfill a particular set of goals. Such work tends to be highly interdisciplinary in nature, as it needs to draw on ideas from such fields as [[linguistics]], [[cognitive psychology]], and [[sociology]]. LCT draws on and incorporates knowledge and research from all these fields.

==Today==
Language and communication are so fundamental to human activity that it is not at all surprising to find that Language and Communication Technologies affect all major areas of society, including health, education, finance, commerce, and travel. Modern LCT is based on a dual tradition of symbols and statistics. This means that nowadays research on language requires access to large databases of information about words and their properties, to large scale computational grammars, to computational tools for working with all levels of language, and to efficient inference systems for performing reasoning. By working computationally it is possible to get to grips with the deeper structure of natural languages, and in particular, to model the crucial interactions between the various levels of language and other cognitive faculties.

Relevant areas of research in LCT include:

*[[Machine translation]]
*[[Information retrieval]]
*[[Ontologies]]
*[[Formal semantics (linguistics)|Formal semantics]]
*[[Knowledge representation and reasoning|Information and knowledge representation]]
*[[Question answering]]
*[[Speech recognition]] and [[Speech synthesis|synthesis]]
*Models of human language processing and understanding
*[[Psycholinguistics]]

==Educational programs==
The increasing interest in the field is proved by the existence of several European Masters in this dynamic research area:&lt;ref&gt;[http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus_mundus/results_compendia/selected_projects_action_1_master_courses_en.php Erasmus Mundus – Action 1 – Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses (EMMCs) | EACEA].

'''Lichen morphology''' includes [[lichen growth forms]] used to group lichens by "vegetative" [[thallus]] types, and forms of "non-vegetative" reproductive parts. Some lichen thalli have the aspect of leaves (foliose lichens); others cover the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] like a crust (crustose lichens) (''illustration, right''), others such as the genus ''[[Ramalina]]'' adopt shrubby forms (fruticose lichens), and there are gelatinous lichens such as the genus ''[[Collema]]''.&lt;ref name=Smith1929&gt;{{cite book |author=Smith, A.L. |year=1929 |title=Lichens |publisher=Cambridge University Press |series=Cambridge Botanical Handbooks |isbn=0-916422-33-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the form of a lichen is determined by the [[DNA|genetic material]] of the fungal partner, association with a photobiont is required for the development of that form.  When grown in the laboratory in the absence of its photobiont, a lichen fungus develops as an undifferentiated mass of [[hypha]]e. If combined with its photobiont under appropriate conditions, its characteristic form emerges, in the process called [[morphogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Brodo, Sharnoff &amp; Sharnoff, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In a few remarkable cases, a single lichen fungus can develop into two very different lichen forms when associating with either a green algal or a cyanobacterial symbiont. Quite naturally, these alternative forms were at first considered to be different species, until they were found growing in a conjoined manner.

There is evidence to suggest that the lichen symbiosis is [[parasitism|parasitic]] or [[commensalism|commensalistic]], rather than [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]].&lt;ref name=Ahmadjian&gt;Ahmadjian 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The photosynthetic partner can exist in nature independently of the fungal partner, but not vice versa. Furthermore, photobiont cells are routinely destroyed in the course of [[nutrient]] exchange. The association is able to continue because reproduction of the photobiont cells matches the rate at which they are destroyed.&lt;ref name=Ahmadjian/&gt;

Under magnification, a section through a typical foliose lichen [[Thallus (tissue)|thallus]] reveals four layers of interlaced fungal filaments. The uppermost layer is formed by densely agglutinated fungal hyphae building a protective outer layer called the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]], which can reach several hundred μm in thickness.&lt;ref name=Budel1996&gt;{{cite journal| author = Büdel, B.|author2=Scheidegger, C. | year = 1996| title = Thallus morphology and anatomy| journal = Lichen Biology| pages = 37–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cortex may be further topped by an epicortex 0.6-1μm thick in some Parmeliaceae, which may be with or without pores, and is secreted by cells—it is not itself cellular.&lt;ref name=Budel1996/&gt; In lichens that include both green algal and cyanobacterial symbionts, the cyanobacteria may be held on the upper or lower surface in small pustules called [[cephalodium|cephalodia]]. Beneath the upper cortex is an algal layer composed of algal cells embedded in rather densely interwoven fungal hyphae. Each cell or group of cells of the photobiont is usually individually wrapped by hyphae, and in some cases penetrated by an [[haustorium]]. Beneath this algal layer is a third layer of loosely interwoven fungal hyphae without algal cells. This layer is called the [[wikt:medulla|medulla]]. Beneath the medulla, the bottom surface resembles the upper surface and is called the [[lower cortex]], again consisting of densely packed fungal hyphae. The lower cortex of [[foliose]] lichens often bears rootlike fungal structures known as [[rhizines]], which serve to attach the thallus to the substrate on which it grows. Lichens also sometimes contain structures made from fungal [[metabolite]]s, for example crustose lichens sometimes have a [[polysaccharide]] layer in the cortex. Although each lichen thallus generally appears homogeneous, some evidence seems to suggest that the fungal component may consist of more than one genetic individual of that species. This seems to also be true of the photobiont species involved.

A [[podetium]] (plural [[podetia]]) is a lichenized stem-like structure of an [[apothecium]] rising from the primary body of the thallus.&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ&gt;[http://www.lichens.lastdragon.org/faq/glossary3.html Alan Silverside's Lichen Glossary (p-z), Alan Silverside]&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is part of the reproductive tissue, it is not considered part of the thallus.&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt; The podetium may be branched, and sometimes cup-like. It usually bears the [[pycnidia]] or [[apothecia]] or both.

The '''MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology''' (often simply called the '''MacDiarmid Institute''') is a [[New Zealand]] research organisation specialising in [[materials science]] and [[nanotechnology]]. It is based at [[Victoria University of Wellington]], although it also draws on other universities and on two [[Crown Research Institute]]s.

The Institute is named after [[Alan MacDiarmid]], a New Zealander who won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] (with two others) in 2000. It was established by the government as one of eight Centres of Research Excellence throughout the country.

The Institute divides its work into six "themes":
*[[Nanofabrication]] and Devices
*[[electro-optics|Electronic and Optical Materials]] (including [[superconductivity]])
*Molecular Materials (including [[conducting polymers]])
*Soft Materials (including [[rheology]], [[fluid mechanics]], [[porous media]])
*Hybrid Materials (inorganic nano-structured materials, inorganic polymers, hybrid organic/inorganic materials)
*The Intersection of Nanoscience and Biology

This program is designed for both recent graduates and individuals with experience in the private or public sector in dealing with [[natural resource]]s and the [[Environmental quality|environment]]. The program seeks students from a range of disciplines including [[biology]], [[engineering]], [[chemistry]], [[forestry]], [[geology]], [[business]], [[economics]], [[geography]], planning and [[social sciences]]. The program is recognized as an accredited [[sustainable planning]] program by the [[Canadian Institute of Planners]] and the [[Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.cip-icu.ca/web/la/en/pa/5580378D83DC444EB76DE6A461BB2E21/template.asp|title=The Canadian Institute of Planners|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=

== Degree requirements ==
The M.R.M. degree requires completion of six required courses (social science in [[natural resource management]], [[ecology]], [[ecological economics]], [[earth systems]], research methods), six elective courses, a [[field workshop]], and a [[research project]].

The aim is to increase familiarity and competence in understanding the dynamics of natural resources, the strategies and techniques of natural resource and [[environmental planning]] and management, and the biological, physical, social, economic and institutional implications of resource decisions. Students also become familiar with various quantitative methods of analysis and aids to [[decision making]]. In the field of natural resources, in particular, it is important that an academic degree provide a foundation for problem-solving as well as creative and critical thinking rather than focus primarily on subject matter such as [[fisheries]], economics, or forestry.

Graduate student research projects required to complete the degree evaluate the effectiveness of existing natural resource management policies and, where appropriate, present alternatives. Students apply a range of approaches including [[cost-benefit analysis]], [[simulation modeling]], legal and institutional assessment frameworks, and social surveys to address critical and emerging natural resource management issues on local, national, and international scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rem.sfu.ca/research/publications/|title=REM Publications|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''memex''' (originally coined "at random",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; though sometimes said to be a [[portmanteau]] of "memory" and "index"&lt;ref name="Buckland"/&gt;) is the name of the hypothetical [[proto-hypertext]] system that [[Vannevar Bush]] described in his 1945 ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' article "[[As We May Think]]". Bush envisioned the memex as a device in which individuals would compress and store all of their books, records, and communications, "mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility".  The memex would provide an "enlarged intimate supplement to one's memory".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Citation | last = Manovich | first = Lev | contribution = As We May Think | title = The New Media Reader | pages = 35 | publisher = The MIT Press}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the memex influenced the development of early [[hypertext]] systems (eventually leading to the creation of the [[World Wide Web]]) and [[personal knowledge base]] software.&lt;ref&gt;DAVIES, Stephen. "Still Building The Memex". ''Communications of The ACM'' 54.2 (Feb. 2011): 80–88. ''Business Source Elite''. Web. 12 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The hypothetical implementation depicted by Bush for the purpose of concrete illustration was based upon a document bookmark list of static [[microfilm]] pages and lacked a true hypertext system, where parts of pages would have internal structure beyond the common textual format. Early electronic hypertext systems were thus inspired by memex rather than modeled directly upon it.

== Details ==

=== A proto-hypertext system ===
In "[[As We May Think]]", Bush describes a memex as an electromechanical device enabling individuals to develop and read a large self-contained research library, create and follow associative trails of links and personal annotations, and recall these trails at any time to share them with other researchers. This device would closely mimic the associative processes of the human mind, but it would be gifted with permanent recollection. As Bush writes, "Thus science may implement the ways in which man produces, stores, and consults the record of the race".{{Sfn | Bush | 1945 | loc =Section 8}}

The technology used would have been a combination of electromechanical controls, [[microfilm]] cameras and readers, all integrated into a large desk.  Most of the microfilm library would have been contained within the desk, but the user could add or remove microfilm reels at will.  A memex would hypothetically read and write content on these microfilm reels, using electric photocells to read coded symbols recorded next to individual microfilm frames while the reels spun at high speed, stopping on command. The coded symbols would enable the memex to index, search, and link content to create and follow associative trails.

The top of the desk would have slanting translucent screens on which material could be projected for convenient reading. The top of the memex would have a transparent platen. When a longhand note, photograph, memoranda, or other things were placed on the platen, the depression of a lever would cause the item to be photographed onto the next blank space in a section of the memex film.

The memex would become "'a sort of mechanized private file and library'.{{Sfn | Bush | 1945 | loc =Section 6}}  It would use microfilm storage, dry photography, and analog computing to give postwar scholars access to a huge, indexed repository of knowledge {{endash}} any section of which could be called up with a few keystrokes."{{Sfn | Wardrip-Fruin | Montfort | 2003 | p = 35}}

The vision of the memex predates, and is credited as the inspiration for, the first practical [[hypertext]] systems of the 1960s. Bush describes the memex and other visions of [[As We May Think]] as projections of technology known in the 1930s and 1940s {{endash}} in the spirit of [[Jules Verne]]'s adventures, or [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s 1945 proposal to orbit [[geosynchronous satellite]]s for global telecommunication. The memex proposed by Bush would create ''trails'' of links connecting sequences of microfilm frames, rather than links in the modern sense where a [[hyperlink]] connects a single word, phrase or picture within a document and a local or remote destination.

===Associative trails===
An associative trail as conceived by Bush would be a way to create a new ''linear'' sequence of microfilm frames across any arbitrary sequence of microfilm frames by creating a chained sequence of links in the way just described, along with personal comments and ''side trails''. At the time Bush saw the current ways of indexing information as limiting and instead proposed a way to store information that was analogous to the mental association of the human brain: storing information with the capability of easy access at a later time using certain cues (in this case, a series of numbers as a code to retrieve data).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The World Wide Web: the Beginning and Now | publisher = U Mich | last = Kaz | first = Matt | url = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mattkaz/history/memex3.html | contribution = Vannevar Bush and Memex}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The closest analogy with the modern Web browser would be to create a list of bookmarks to articles relevant to a topic, and then to have some mechanism for automatically scrolling through the articles (for example, use [[Google]] to search for a keyword, obtain a list of matches, repeatedly use the "open in new tab" feature of the Web browser, and then visit each tab sequentially). Modern hypertext systems with word and phrase-level linking offer more sophistication in connecting relevant information, but until the rise of [[wiki]] and other [[social software]] models, modern hypertext systems have rarely imitated Bush in providing individuals with the ability to create personal trails and share them with colleagues – or publish them widely.

===Other features===
The memex would have features other than linking. The user could record new information on microfilm, by taking photos from paper or from a touch-sensitive translucent screen. A user could "...insert a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. ...Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him."{{Sfn | Bush | 1945 | loc=Section 7}} A user could also create a copy of an interesting trail (containing references and personal annotations) and "...pass it to his friend for insertion in his own memex, there to be linked into the more general trail."{{Sfn | Bush | 1945 | loc=Section 7}} As observers like Tim Oren have pointed out, the memex could be considered to be a microfilm-based precursor to the [[personal computer]].  The September 10, 1945, [[Life magazine]] article showed the first illustrations of what the memex desk&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite/Secondary.html | publisher = Sloan | title = Mouse site | place = Stanford | contribution = Secondary}}.&lt;/ref&gt; could look like, as well as illustrations of a head-mounted [[camera]], which a scientist could wear while doing experiments, and a [[typewriter]] capable of [[speech recognition|voice recognition]] and of reading text by [[speech synthesis]]. Considered together, these memex machines were probably the earliest practical description of what we would call today the [[Office of the future]].

"Given a memex, a scholar could create her own knowledge tools as connections within reams of information, share these tools, and use complexes of tools to create yet more sophisticated knowledge that could in turn be deployed toward this work.  The memex has been envisioned as a means of turning an information explosion into a knowledge explosion. This remains one of the defining dreams of [[new media]]."{{Sfn | Wardrip-Fruin | Montfort | 2003 | p = 35}}

=== Extending, storing, and consulting the record of the species ===
Bush's idea for the memex extended far beyond a mechanism which might augment the research of one individual working in isolation. In Bush's idea, the ability to connect, annotate, and share both published works and personal trails would profoundly change the process by which the "world's record" is created and used:

{{blockquote|Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified. The lawyer has at his touch the associated opinions and decisions of his whole experience, and of the experience of friends and authorities. The patent attorney has on call the millions of issued patents, with familiar trails to every point of his client's interest. The physician, puzzled by a patient's reactions, strikes the trail established in studying an earlier similar case, and runs rapidly through analogous case histories, with side references to the classics for the pertinent anatomy and histology. ...

The historian, with a vast chronological account of a people, parallels it with a skip trail which stops only on the salient items, and can follow at any time contemporary trails which lead him all over civilization at a particular epoch. There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record. The inheritance from the master becomes, not only his additions to the world's record, but for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which they were erected. {{emdash}} ''[[As We May Think]]'' 
}}

Bush states that "technical difficulties of all sorts have been ignored," but that, "also ignored are means as yet unknown which may come any day to accelerate technical progress as violently as did the advent of the thermionic tube."{{Sfn | Bush | 1945 | loc=Section 8}}  Indeed, anyone who stops to consider the performance consequences of trail following – let alone link-directed [[pointer chasing]] – over a microfilm library of near universal scope should quickly come to the conclusion that microfilm is no more appropriate a technology for implementing AWMT's vision than [[Jules Verne]]'s cannon is an appropriate technology for sending astronauts to the Moon.  In both cases the vision may be more significant than the specific technology used to describe it. See [[Michael Buckland]]'s conclusion: "Bush's contributions in this area were twofold: (i) A significant engineering achievement by the team under his leadership in building a truly rapid prototype microfilm selector, and (ii) a speculative article, 'As We May Think,' which, through its skillful writing and the social prestige of its author, has had an immediate and lasting effect in stimulating others."&lt;ref name="Buckland"&gt;[[Michael Buckland|Buckland, Michael K.]] "Emanuel Goldberg, Electronic Document Retrieval, And Vannevar Bush's Memex". Journal of the American Society for Information Science 43, no. 4 (May 1992): 284–94&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Memex: Getting Back on the Trail",&lt;ref name="Nyce"&gt;Nyce, James M.; Kahn, Paul (eds.) "From Memex to Hypertext: Vannevar Bush and the Mind's Machine". San Diego, London (...) 1991.  [A reprint of all of Bush's texts regarding Memex accompanied by related Sources and Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Oren argues that Bush's original vision expressed in AWMT describes a "...private device into which public encyclopedias and colleague's trails might be inserted to be joined with the owner's own work."

However, in Bush's manuscript draft of "Memex II" of 1959,&lt;ref name= "Nyce"/&gt; Bush says, "Professional societies will no longer print papers..." and states that individuals will either order sets of papers to come on tape – complete with photographs and diagrams – or download 'facsimiles' by telephone. Each society would maintain a 'master memex' containing all papers, references, tables "intimately interconnected by trails, so that one may follow a detailed matter from paper to paper, going back through the classics, recording criticism in the margins."

=== Missing features: search and metadata ===
The AWMT paper did not describe any automatic search, nor any universal [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]] scheme such as a standard [[library classification]] or a hypertext element set like the [[Dublin Core|Dublin core]]. Instead, when the user made an entry, such as a new or annotated manuscript, typescript or image, he was expected to index and describe it in his personal code book. By consulting his code book, the user could retrace annotated and generated entries.

Between 1990 and 1994, [[Paul Flaherty]], a Stanford student who was looking for a project, was introduced by his wife to her supervisor.  The supervisor had just seen a demonstration of the World Wide Web and suggested it could be improved and better conformed to the memex described by Vannevar Bush if links did not have to be manually inserted and instead one could follow a link simply by using the words themselves.  Flaherty went on to create [[AltaVista]], the first searchable, full-text database of a large part of the Web.

By 1999, many companies had created [[Web annotation|web annotation systems]], where web site publishers or users could annotate web pages. Sentius Corporation, for one, developed technology that would automatically insert hyperlinks into web or text documents, from a dictionary of terms. This was used in particular to display Japanese translations of English medical terms when the mouse hovered over a term, while maintaining the look of a standard text document normally, and then extended for other purposes.
 
== Legacy ==
This idea directly influenced computer pioneers [[J.C.R. Licklider]] (see his 1960 paper ''[[Man-Computer Symbiosis]]''), [[Douglas Engelbart]] (see his 1962 report ''[[Augmenting Human Intellect]]''), and also led to [[Ted Nelson]]'s groundbreaking work in concepts of [[hypermedia]] and [[hypertext]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = [[Engines of Creation]] | year = 1986 | first = K Eric | last = Drexler | author-link = K. Eric Drexler}}{{Page needed |date=November 2011}}{{verify source| date= November 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=November 2011}}{{verify source|date=November 2011}}

''As We May Think'' also predicted many kinds of technology invented after its publication in addition to [[hypertext]] such as [[personal computers]], the [[Internet]], the [[World Wide Web]], [[speech recognition]], and [[CD-ROM encyclopedia]]s such as [[Encarta]] and [[online encyclopedia]]s such as [[Wikipedia]]: "Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified."{{Sfn | Bush | 1945 | loc=Section 8}}

Bush's influence is still evident in research laboratories of today in [[Gordon Bell]]'s [[MyLifeBits]] (from [[Microsoft Research]]), which implements [[Path (graph theory)|path]]-based systems reminiscent of the Memex, is especially impactful in the areas of [[information retrieval]] and [[information science]].&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, B. J. and Rieh, S. (2010) [https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/jansen_theoretical_constructs.pdf The Seventeen Theoretical Constructs of Information Searching and Information Retrieval]. Journal of the American Society for Information Sciences and Technology. 61(8), 1517-1534.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fictional implementation of the memex appears in [[The Laundry Files]] series by [[Charles Stross]].

A high-performance computing cluster (HPC) at the [[Carnegie Institution for Science]] is named "Memex".

=== DARPA's Memex program ===
In early 2014, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) released a statement on their website outlining the preliminary details of the "Memex program", which aims at developing new search technologies overcoming some limitations of text-based search.&lt;ref name="DARPA PR 20140209"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Memex Aims to Create a New Paradigm for Domain-Specific Search |url=http://www.darpa.mil/newsevents/releases/2014/02/09.aspx |publisher=[[DARPA]] |date=February 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DARPA wants the Memex technology developed in this research to be usable for search engines that can search for information on the [[Deep Web (search indexing)|Deep Web]] – the part of the Internet that is largely unreachable by commercial search engines like [[Google]] or [[Yahoo]]. DARPA's website describes that "The goal is to invent better methods for interacting with and sharing information, so users can quickly and thoroughly organize and search subsets of information relevant to their individual interests".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/program/memex|title=Memex (Domain-Specific Search)|website=www.darpa.mil|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As reported in a 2015 ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' article, the search technology being developed in the Memex program "aims to shine a light on the [[dark web]] and uncover patterns and relationships in online data to help law enforcement and others track illegal activity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Darpa Is Developing a Search Engine for the Dark Web |author=Kim Zetter |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=February 2, 2015 |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/darpa-memex-dark-web/}}&lt;/ref&gt; DARPA intends for the program to replace the centralized procedures used by commercial search engines, stating that the "creation of a new domain-specific indexing and search paradigm will provide mechanisms for improved content discovery, information extraction, information retrieval, user collaboration, and extension of current search capabilities to the deep web, the dark web, and nontraditional (e.g. multimedia) content".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In their description of the program, DARPA explains the program's name as a tribute to Bush's original Memex invention, which served as an inspiration.&lt;ref name="DARPA PR 20140209" /&gt;

In April 2015, it was announced parts of Memex would be open sourced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2015/04/17/darpa-nasa-and-partners-show-off-memex/ |title=Watch Out Google, DARPA Just Open Sourced All This Swish 'Dark Web' Search Tech |work= |author=Forbes |date=April 17, 2015 |accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modules were available for download.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opencatalog.darpa.mil/MEMEX.html |title=Memex (Domain-Specific Search) |publisher=DARPA |author= |date= |accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memex revisited ==
In 1967, Vannevar Bush published a retrospective article entitled "Memex Revisited"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Bush, Vannevar. "Memex Revisited," ''Science Is Not Enough'' (New York: William Morrow &amp; Co., 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; in his book ''Science Is Not Enough''. Published 22 years after his initial conception of the Memex, Bush details the various technological advancements that have made his vision a possibility. Specifically, Bush cites photocells, transistors, cathode ray tubes, magnetic and video tape, "high-speed electric circuits", and "miniaturization of solid-state devices" such as the TV and radio. The article claims that [[magnetic tape]] would be central to the creation of a modern Memex device. The erasable quality of the tape is of special significance, as this would allow for modification of information stored in the proposed Memex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the article, Bush stresses the continued importance of supplementing "how creative men think" and relates that the systems for indexing data are still insufficient and rely too much on linear pathways rather than the association-based system of the human brain. Bush writes that a machine with the "speed and flexibility" of the brain is not attainable, but improvements could be made in regard to the capacity to obtain informational "permanence and clarity".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bush also relates that, unlike digital technology, Memex would be of no significant aid to business or profitable ventures, and as a consequence its development would occur only long after the mechanization of libraries and the introduction of what he describes as the specialized "group machine", which would be useful for the sharing of ideas in fields such as medicine. Furthermore, although Bush discusses the compressional ability and rapidity so key to modern machines, he relates that speed will not be an integral part of Memex, stating that a tenth of a second would be an acceptable interval for its data retrieval, rather than the billionths of a second that modern computers are capable of. "For Memex," he writes, "the problem is not swift access, but selective access". Bush states that although the code-reading and potential linking capabilities of the rapid selector would be key to the creation of Memex, there is still an issue of enabling "moderately rapid access to really large memory storage". There is an issue concerning selection, Bush conveys, and despite the fact that improvements have been made in the speed of digital selection, according to Bush, "selection, in the broad sense, is still a stone adze in the hands of the cabinetmaker". Bush goes on to discuss the record-making process and how Memex could incorporate systems of voice-control and user-propagated learning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He proposes a machine that could respond to "simple remarks" as well as build trails&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; based on its user's "habits of association," as Belinda Barnet described them in "The Technical Evolution of Vannevar Bush's Memex." Barnet also makes the distinction between the idea of a constructive Memex and the "permanent trails" described in ''As We May Think,'' and attributes Bush's machine learning concepts to Claude Shannon's mechanical mouse and work with "feedback and [[machine learning]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnet|first=Belinda|date=2008-01-01|title=The Technical Evolution of Vannevar Bush's Memex|url=http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/2/1/000015/000015.html|volume=2|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program''' under the Civil Affairs and Military Government Sections of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] armies was established in 1943 to help protect cultural property in war areas during and after [[World War II]]. The group of approximately 400 service members and civilians worked with military forces to safeguard historic and cultural monuments from war damage, and as the conflict came to a close, to find and return works of art and other items of cultural importance that had been [[Nazi plunder|stolen by the Nazis]] or hidden for safekeeping.

Many of the men and women of the MFAA, also known as '''Monuments Men''', went on to have prolific careers. Largely art historians and museum personnel, they had formative roles in the growth of many of the United States’ greatest cultural institutions, including the [[National Gallery of Art]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and the [[New York City Ballet]], as well as in museums and other institutions in Europe.

== Formation ==
Even before the U.S. entered World War II, art professionals and organizations such as the American Defense Harvard Group and the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (ACLS) were working to identify and protect European art and monuments in harm’s way or in danger of Nazi plundering. The groups sought a national organization affiliated with the military which would have the same goal. [[Francis Henry Taylor]], director of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], took their concerns to Washington, D.C. Their efforts ultimately led to the establishment by [[U.S. President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] of the "American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historic Monuments in War Areas" on June 23, 1943.

What began as a brain trust of the art world’s finest during the war became a group of 345 men and women from 13 countries that comprised the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Section unit. They spent 1945 seeking out more than 1,000 troves containing an estimated 5 million pieces of artwork and cultural items stolen from wealthy Jews, museums, universities, and religious institutions. And for six years after the surrender, a smaller group of about 60 Monuments Men continued scouring Europe as art detectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/08/where-the-nazis-hid-their-art-the-castle-behind-monument-men.html|title=Where the Nazis Hid Their Art: The Castle Behind ‘Monuments Men’|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly referred to as the [[Roberts Commission]] after its chairman, Supreme Court Justice [[Owen J. Roberts]], the group was charged with promoting the preservation of cultural properties in war areas, including the European, Mediterranean, and Far Eastern Theaters of Operations, providing that this mission did not interfere with military operations. Headquartered at the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., the Commission drew up lists of and reports on European cultural treasures and provided them to military units, in hopes that these monuments would be protected whenever possible.

The Commission helped establish the MFAA branch within the Civil Affairs and Military Government Sections of the Allied armies, led by Major [[L. Bancel LaFarge]]. After the war, the Roberts Commission helped the MFAA and Allied Forces return Nazi-confiscated artworks to rightful owners. It also promoted public awareness of looted cultural works. The group was dissolved in June 1946, when the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] took over its duties and functions.

[[General (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] facilitated the work of the MFAA by forbidding looting, destruction, and billeting in structures of cultural significance. He also repeatedly ordered his forces to assist the MFAA as much as possible. This was the first time in history an army attempted to fight a war and at the same time reduce damage to cultural monuments and property.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Prior to this war, no army had thought of protecting the monuments of the country in which and with which it was at war, and there were no precedents to follow.... All this was changed by a general order issued by Supreme Commander-in-Chief [General Eisenhower] just before he left Algiers, an order accompanied by a personal letter to all Commanders...the good name of the Army depended in great measure on the respect which it showed to the art heritage of the modern world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lambourne|first=Nicola|title=War Damage in Western Europe: The Destruction of Historic Monuments During the Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u7oyrzWBRLIC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=Prior+to+this+war,+no+army+had+thought+of+protecting+the+monuments+of+the+country&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NnTABpxkkB&amp;sig=I1q9LbppwC-vLK2RtgJJwU85Acc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JK6mS_S6IM6Utge9gJX2CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Prior%20to%20this%20war%2C%20no%20army%20had%20thought%20of%20protecting%20the%20monuments%20of%20the%20country&amp;f=false |accessdate=24 April 2015|year=2001|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-1285-7|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:—Lt. Col. Sir [[Leonard Woolley]], Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Officer

== War operations ==
As Allied Forces made their way through Europe, liberating [[Nazi-occupied territories]], Monuments Men were present in very small numbers at the front lines. Lacking handbooks, resources, or supervision, this initial handful of officers relied on their museum training and overall resourcefulness to perform their tasks. There was no established precedent for what they confronted. They worked in the field under the Operations Branch of SHAEF ([[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]], Europe, commanded by Eisenhower), and were actively involved in battle preparations. In preparing to take [[Florence]], which was used by the Nazis as a supply distribution center due to its central location in [[Italy]], Allied troops relied on aerial photographs provided by the MFAA which were marked with monuments of cultural importance so that pilots could avoid damaging such sites during bombings.

When damage to monuments did occur, MFAA personnel worked to assess damage and buy time for the eventual restoration work that would follow. Monuments officer [[Deane Keller]] had a prominent role in saving the [[Camposanto Monumentale|Campo Santo]] in [[Pisa]] after a mortar round started a fire that melted the lead roof, which then bled down the iconic 14th century [[fresco]]-covered walls. Keller led a team of Italian and American troops and restorers in recovering the remaining fragments of the frescoes and in building a temporary roof to protect the structure from further damage. Restoration of the frescoes continues even today.

Countless other monuments, churches, and works of art were saved or protected by the dedicated personnel of the MFAA section. Frequently entering liberated towns and cities ahead of ground troops, Monuments Men worked quickly to assess damage and make temporary repairs before moving on with Allied Armies as they conquered Nazi territory.

== Art repositories ==
American and allied forces in Europe discovered hidden caches of priceless treasures. Many were the product of looting by [[Adolf Hitler]] and the Nazis. Others had been legitimately evacuated from museums for safekeeping. Monuments Men oversaw the safeguarding, cataloguing, removal and packing of all works from all these repositories.

In Italy, museum officials had sent their holdings to various countryside locations such as the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] villa of Montegufoni, which housed some of the Florentine collections.  As Allied forces advanced through Italy, the German army retreated north, stealing paintings and sculptures from these repositories as they fled. As German forces neared the [[Austria]]n border, they were forced to store most of their loot in various hiding places, such as a castle at [[Sand in Taufers]] and a jail cell in [[San Leonardo, Friuli|San Leonardo]].

Beginning in late March 1945, Allied forces began discovering these hidden repositories in what would become the "greatest treasure hunt in history". In Germany alone, U.S. forces found about 1,500 repositories of art and cultural objects looted from institutions and individuals across Europe, as well as German and Austrian museum collections that had been evacuated for safekeeping.  Soviet forces also made discoveries, such as treasures from the extraordinary [[Dresden Transport Museum]]. Hundreds of the artifacts were surrendered by, or had their locations reported by, [[SS]] General [[Karl Wolff]] as part of [[Operation Sunrise (World War II)|Operation Sunrise]], his secret negotiation with the [[Office of Strategic Services]]. These included the contents of the [[Uffizi Palace|Uffizi]] and [[Pitti Palace|Pitti]] palaces and paintings by Titian and Botticelli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XHYkBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT381&amp;lpg=PT381&amp;dq=Pitti+and+Uffizi.+wolff&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q6UZf1Ja6A&amp;sig=Dj0HX_js5Co7--J-Il6fzVvFUkY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjr_p253rDZAhUSSN8KHW4TBhcQ6AEwD3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Pitti%20and%20Uffizi.%20wolff&amp;f=false|title=The Last 100 Days: The Tumultuous and Controversial Story of the Final Days of World War II in Europe|last=Toland|first=John|date=2014-11-26|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=9780804180948|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the repositories discovered by Monuments Men in Germany, Austria, and Italy were:
*[[Berchtesgaden]], Germany: The [[101st Airborne Division]], known as the "Screaming Eagles", found more than 1,000 paintings and sculptures stolen by German [[Reichsmarschall]] [[Hermann Göring]]. The cache had been evacuated from his country estate, [[Carinhall]], and moved to Berchtesgaden in April 1945 to protect it from the invading Russians.
*[[Breitenworbis|Bernterode]], Germany: Americans found four coffins containing the remains of Germany’s greatest leaders, including those of Frederick the Great ([[Frederick II of Prussia]]) and [[Generalfeldmarschall|field marshal]] [[Paul Von Hindenburg]].  Also found in the mine were 271 paintings, including court portraits from the [[Prussia]]n [[Sanssouci]] palace in [[Potsdam]], Germany, which had been hidden behind a locked door and a brick wall nearly five feet thick. The site was originally used as an ammunition and military supply complex manned by hundreds of slave laborers.
*[[Merkers]], Germany: The Kaiserode mine at Merkers was discovered by the U.S. 3rd Army under General [[George S. Patton]] in April 1945. [[Reichsbank]] gold, along with 400 paintings from the Berlin museums and numerous other crates of treasures were also discovered.  More dismal discoveries included gold and personal belongings from [[Nazi concentration camp]] victims.
*[[Neuschwanstein Castle]], Germany: Over 6,000 items stolen by the ERR ([[Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg]], [[Alfred Rosenberg]]’s task force that handled the "legalized" looting of Jews) from private collectors in [[France]] were found here, including furniture, jewelry (see [[Nazi gold]]), paintings and other belongings. Monuments Man [[Captain (United States)|Capt.]] [[James Rorimer]] oversaw the evacuation of the repository, which also held ERR documents.
*[[Altaussee#Nazi repository for stolen art|Altaussee]], Austria: This extensive complex of salt mines served as a huge repository for art stolen by the Nazis, but it also contained holdings from Austrian collections. More than 6,500 paintings alone were discovered at Altaussee. The contents included: [[Belgian]]-owned treasures such as [[Michelangelo]]’s ''[[Madonna of Bruges]]'' stolen from the [[Church of Our Lady (Bruges)|Church of Our Lady]] in [[Bruges]], and [[Jan van Eyck]]’s ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' stolen from [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]] in [[Ghent]]; [[Vermeer]]’s ''[[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|The Astronomer]]'' and ''[[The Art of Painting]]'' which were to be focal points of Hitler’s [[Führermuseum]] in [[Linz]], Austria; and paintings from the [[Capodimonte Museum]] in [[Naples]], Italy that had been stolen by the Hermann Göring Tank Division ([[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann Göring]]) at [[Monte Cassino]] in Italy.
*[[San Leonardo, Italy|San Leonardo]], Italy:  In the jail cell of this far northern town, Allied officials discovered paintings from the [[Uffizi]] that had been hurriedly unloaded by retreating German troops.  Among the masterpieces were paintings by [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Filippo Lippi]] and [[Giovanni Bellini]].

== Restitutions ==
In early May 1945, [[Lieutenant Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lt. Col]]. [[Geoffrey Webb]], British MFAA chief at Eisenhower’s headquarters, proposed that U.S. forces quickly prepare buildings in Germany so that they might receive large shipments of artworks and other cultural property found in the numerous repositories. Eisenhower directed his subordinates to immediately begin preparing such buildings, ordering that art objects were to be handled only by MFAA personnel. Suitable locations with little damage and adequate storage space were difficult to find.

By July 1945, U.S. forces had established two central collecting points within the [[Allied-occupied Germany#American Zone of Occupation|U.S. Zone in Germany]]: [[Munich]] and [[Wiesbaden]]. Secondary collecting points were also established in various German towns, including: [[Bad Wildungen]], [[Heilbronn]], [[Marburg]], [[Nuremberg]], and [[Oberammergau]]. One of the more critical of these secondary collecting points was at [[Offenbach (district)|Offenbach]], where officials processed millions of Nazi-looted books, archives, manuscripts, Jewish objects such as [[Torah scroll]]s, and property seized from [[Masonic]] lodges.

In summer 1945, Capt. Walter Farmer became the collecting point's first director. The first shipment of artworks arriving at Wiesbaden. When his superiors ordered that he send to the U.S. 202 German-owned paintings in his custody, Farmer and 35 others who were in charge of the Wiesbaden collection point gathered to draw up what has become known as the [[Wiesbaden manifesto]] on 7 November 1945, declaring "We wish to state that, from our own knowledge, no historical grievance will rankle so long or be the cause of so much justified bitterness as the removal for any reason of a part of the heritage of any nation even if that heritage may be interpreted as a prize of war." Among the co-signers was [[Lieutenant|Lt.]] [[Charles Percy Parkhurst]] of the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Walter I. |last=Farmer |title=The Safekeepers: A Memoir of the Arts at the End of World War II |location=Berlin and New York |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=2000 |isbn=978-3-11-016897-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas C. |last=Howe Jr.|year=1946 |title=Salt mines and castles: The discovery and restitution of looted European art |location=Indiana |publisher=Bobbs-Merrill Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once an object arrived at a collecting point, it was recorded, photographed, studied, and sometimes conserved so that it could be returned to its country of origin as soon as possible. Some objects were easily identifiable and could be quickly returned, such as the [[Veit Stoss]] [[Altar of Veit Stoss]] from [[St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków|St. Mary's Basilica]] in [[Kraków]], which had been discovered in the [[Nuremberg Castle]]. Others, such as unmarked paintings or library collections, were much more difficult to process.
Among the facilities were:
*[[Munich Central Collecting Point]] (MCP):  Monuments officer Lt. Craig Hugh Smyth established the MCP in July 1945. He converted the former ''Führerbau'', which housed Hitler’s office, into a functional art depot complete with photography studios and conservation labs. This facility primarily housed art stolen by the ERR from private collections and Hitler’s collection found at Altaussee.
*Wiesbaden Collecting Point (WCP): Monuments officer Capt. Walter Farmer helped establish this facility in July 1945. Art from the [[Berlin]] museums and other items found in the mines at Merkers were processed here. Museum collections stored at [[Siegen]] and [[Grasleben]] also were sent to Wiesbaden.
*[[Offenbach Archival Depot|Offenbach Collecting Point (OCP)]], also known as the Offenbach Archival Depot:  Established in July 1945 in the I.G. Farben building on the Main River just outside [[Frankfurt]], [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]] primarily served as an archival depot. Because the OCP housed the largest collection of Jewish cultural property in the world, including the entire holdings of the Rothschild Library in Frankfurt and cultural objects from Masonic lodges, restitutions were complicated. Identification of the millions of books, religious objects and other materials was tedious. Many of the owners had become victims of the [[Holocaust]] leaving no one alive to pursue claims. The facility was closed in 1948 and its remaining unclaimed items were transferred to Wiesbaden.

==Occupation of Japan==
As the war neared its end in Japan in 1945, George Stout and fellow Monuments Man [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Laurence Sickman]] recommended creating an MFAA division there. Consequently, the Arts and Monuments Division of the Civil Information and Education Section of GHQ of the Supreme Command of the Allied Powers in Tokyo was established. Stout was the Chief of the Division from about August 1945 until the middle of 1946.&lt;ref name=ueno&gt;{{cite web|last=Ueno|first=Rihoko|title=Monuments Men in Japan: Discoveries in the George Leslie Stout papers|url=http://blog.aaa.si.edu/2012/10/monuments-men-in-japan-discoveries-in-the-george-leslie-stout-papers.html|work=Archives of American Art|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=20 September 2013|date=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Langdon Warner]], archaeologist and curator of Oriental art at Harvard’s Fogg Museum, advised the MFAA Section in Japan from April to September 1946. Other members who served in [[Tokyo]]’s Arts and Monuments Division include Howard Hollis,  [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lt. Col.]] [[Harold Gould Henderson]], Lt. [[Sherman Lee]], and Lt. [[Patrick Lennox Tierney]].&lt;ref name=ueno /&gt;&lt;ref name=weber&gt;{{cite news |last=Weber |first=Bruce |title=Sherman Lee, Who Led Cleveland Museum, Dies at 90 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kappes |first=John |title=Sherman Lee, who led the Cleveland Museum of Art to global renown, dead at 90 |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |location=Cleveland |date=July 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MFAA personnel==
{{Hatnote|For a list of MFAA personnel, see [[List of Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives (MFAA) personnel]]}}
The American museum establishment led the efforts to create the MFAA section. Included in this group were current museum directors, curators and art historians, as well as those who aspired to join their ranks. Upon returning home from service overseas, these men and women led the creation or improvement of some of the leading cultural institutions in the United States. Many major museums employed one or more MFAA officers before or after the war, including the [[National Gallery of Art]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Toledo Museum of Art]], and the [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]].

Many other Monuments Men were professors at esteemed universities such as [[Harvard]], [[Yale]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[New York University]], [[Williams College]], and [[Columbia University]], among others. [[Paul J. Sachs]]’ famous "Museum Course" at Harvard educated dozens of future museum personnel in the decades preceding World War II. [[S. Lane Faison]]'s passion for art history was passed on to hundreds of students and future museum leaders at Williams College in the 1960s and 1970s, some of whom are currently directors at major United States museums.

Other MFAA personnel became founders, presidents, and members of cultural institutions such as the [[New York City Ballet]], the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]], the [[American Alliance of Museums|American Association of Museums]], the American Association of Museum Directors, the [[Archaeological Institute of America]], the [[Society of Architectural Historians]], the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]], the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], as well as respected artists, architects, musicians, and [[archivist]]s.

Two monuments officers were killed in Europe, both near the front lines of the Allied advance into Germany: Captain Walter Huchthausen, an American scholar and architect attached to the [[United States 9th Army|U.S. 9th Army]], was killed in April 1945 by [[small arms]] fire somewhere north of Essen and east of Aachen, Germany;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert M. |last=Edsel |title=The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves, and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History |location=New York |publisher=Center Street |year=2009 |pages=284-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] [[Ronald Edmond Balfour]], a British scholar attached to the [[Canadian First Army]], was killed in March 1945 by an explosion in Cleves, Germany.&lt;ref&gt; Edsel, (2009), pp. 242-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Niente''' ({{IPA-it|ˈnjɛnte}}), also called '''quasi niente''' {{IPA-it|ˈkwaːzi ˈnjɛnte|}}, is a [[dynamics (music)|musical dynamic]] often used at the end of a piece to direct the performer to fade the music away to little more than a bare whisper, normally gradually with a [[Dynamics (music)#Gradual changes|diminuendo]],&lt;ref&gt;''Collins Encyclopedia of Music'', p. 379. {{ISBN|0-907486-50-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''al niente'''.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Helen (2009). ''Young People's Guide to Classical Music'', p.32. Hal Leonard. {{ISBN|9781574671810}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often written as "[[File:Music-diminuendo.svg|25px]]{{serif|'''''n'''''}}" or "[[File:Music-diminuendo.svg|25px]]{{serif|'''''ø'''''}}".
It is also used to direct the performer to fade into a note without any articulation at the beginning of the note, known as '''dal niente''' (from nothing): "{{serif|'''''n'''''}}[[File:Music-crescendo.svg|25px]]".

Niente is distinct from a [[musical rest|rest]] "in that [during niente] the musician is engaged in making sound but so softly that the sound can not be heard."&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Joyce Ann (2010). ''Silence: Everyday Living and Praying'', p.63n8. Liturgy Training Publications. {{ISBN|9781568549026}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his notable projects are museums in Frankfurt, Hamburg and Cologne.

==Biography==
Oswald Mathias Ungers was born in [[Kaisersesch]] in the [[Eifel]] region. From 1947 to 1950 he studied architecture at the [[Universität Karlsruhe (TH)|University of Karlsruhe]] under [[Egon Eiermann]]. He set up an architectural practice in [[Cologne]] in 1950, and opened offices in [[Berlin]] in 1964, [[Frankfurt]] in 1974 and [[Karlsruhe]] in 1983.

He was a professor at the [[Technical University of Berlin]] from 1963 to 1967 and served as the dean of the faculty of architecture from 1965 to 1967. In 1968 he moved to the United States, where he became the chair of the department of architecture at [[Cornell University]] from 1969 to 1975. In 1971 he became a member of the [[American Institute of Architects]]. He was also a visiting professor at [[Harvard University]] (1973 and 1978) and the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (1974/75). He returned to Germany in 1976, becoming a visiting professor at the [[University of Applied Arts Vienna]] (1979/80) and a full professor at the [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf]] (1986).

Oswald Mathias Ungers died on 30 September 2007 from [[pneumonia]]. He was married to Liselotte Gabler (1926–2010) and had one son ([[Simon Ungers]]) and two daughters.

{{confuse|Panniculus}}

'''Pannus''' is an abnormal layer of fibrovascular tissue or [[granulation tissue]]. Common sites for pannus formation include over the cornea, over a joint surface (as seen in [[rheumatoid arthritis]]), or on a [[prosthetic heart valve]].&lt;ref&gt;Farlex Partner Medical Dictionary © Farlex 2012 [http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/pannus]&lt;/ref&gt; Pannus may grow in a tumor-like fashion, as in joints where it may erode articular [[cartilage]] and bone.

In common usage, the term ''pannus'' is often used to refer to a [[panniculus]] (a hanging flap of tissue).

== Pannus in rheumatoid arthritis ==

The term "'''pannus'''" is derived from the Latin for "tablecloth". Inflammation and exuberant proliferation of the synovium leads to formation of '''pannus''' and destruction of cartilage, bone, tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Rheumatoid Arthritis: Practice Essentials, Background, Pathophysiology|url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/331715-overview#a3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basically, the hypertrophied synovium is called pannus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = RA Pathophysiology|url = http://www.hopkinsarthritis.org/arthritis-info/rheumatoid-arthritis/ra-pathophysiology-2/|website = www.hopkinsarthritis.org|accessdate = 2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pannus tissue is composed of aggressive macrophage- and fibroblast-like mesenchymal cells, macrophage-like cells and other inflammatory cells that release collagenolytic enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.clinexprheumatol.org/article.asp?a=3405|title = Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis pannus have similar qualitative metabolic characteristics and pro-inflammatory cytokine response|date = 2008|accessdate = December 5, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Furuzawa-Carballeda|first = J.|last2 = Macip-Rodríguez|first2 = P.M.|last3 = Cabral|first3 = A.R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In people suffering from [[rheumatoid arthritis]], '''pannus tissue''' eventually forms in the [[joint]] affected by the disease, causing loss of [[bone]] and [[cartilage]]. From '''Autoimmunity and Disease''' by Harley Y. Tse and Michail K. Shaw:{{cquote|Chronic stages of the disease typically coincide with the formation of a structure known as a pannus. A pannus is a membrane of granulation tissue composed of mesenchyme- and bone marrow-derived cells. Formation of the pannus stimulates the release of IL-1, platelet-derived growth factor, prostaglandins, and substance P by macrophages, which ultimately cause cartilage destruction and bone erosion.}}

== Pannus in ophthalmology ==

In [[ophthalmology]], '''pannus''' refers to the growth of blood vessels into the peripheral [[cornea]]. In normal individuals, the cornea is [[Blood vessel|avascular]]. Chronic local [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (such as that occurring with overuse of [[contact lenses]]) or inflammation may lead to peripheral corneal vascularization, or pannus. Pannus may also develop in diseases of the corneal [[stem cell]]s, such as [[aniridia]]. It is often resolved by [[peritomy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4735">'''Philippa Hobbs''' is a published South African art historian, an artist and an art collector. She was born in 1955 and matriculated at St Andrew's School in 1972. She studied art at the Johannesburg College of Art before finishing a post-graduate [[printmaking]] course at the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)]]. She then furthered her studies through [[University of South Africa]] (UNISA) and the [[Technikon Witwatersrand]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.durbanet.co.za/exhib/dag/hr/cl08.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbs was a senior Professor of History of Art at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg from 1988 to 1993. She has been noted for her contribution to the practice of art (with national and international exhibitions), art education, research and most recently, community development through art. Hobbs currently works are MTN Art Collection Curator and Arts and Culture Portolio Senior Manager.

==Art==

Hobbs was invited to contribute to the Images of Human Rights project in 1996, which involved artists making visual representation of each clause of South Africa's Bill of Rights. Hobbs' designated clause was Clause 8: Freedom of Expression, where her woodcut - 'Received by the Tongue' - shows the precarious balance between rights of expression and the subsequent consequences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.durbanet.co.za/exhib/dag/hr/cl08.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works by Hobbs include '''Dracunculus and Cat's Cradle'' - a woodcut produced in 1993 and ''Spiritus Candelabrae'' - a two colour woodcut produced in 1992.

==Teaching==

Hobbs also took classes and workshops from her own printmaking studio, 'Foot Print Studio'. The studio started in order to offer visual training and printmaking guidance to beginners and advanced artists.

==Publications==

Hobbs co-published Printmaking in a Transforming South Africa with Elizabeth Rankin in 1997 (David Philip Publishers), which discusses how printmaking has “traversed the divisions of South African art”&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, P., Rankin, E. 1997. Printmaking in a Transforming South Africa. Claremont: David Philip Publishers.{{ISBN|0-86486334-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and describes the technical and expressive components of printmaking, while also exploring the role it played as a form of resistance during the liberation struggle.

In 2003 Hobbs and Rankin published Rorke’s Drift Empowering Prints,&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, P., Rankin, E., 2003. Rorke’s Drift Empowering Prints. Cape Town: Double Story Books.{{ISBN|1-919930-13-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which looks at the Evangelical Lutheran Church Art and Craft Centre, more popularly known as [[Rorke's Drift Art and Craft Centre]], and the art produced by the black artists who studied there.

Hobbs’ most recent publication, Messages and Meaning, is a catalog for the MTN Art Collection for which she is curator. It is a collection of essays by writers such as Nessa Leibhammer, Elizabeth Rankin, Wilma Cruise and other prominent authors. It explores how the collection is “a tool for social investment, an educational resource, a means of inspiring in-house communication and debate, and a showcase of South African and African art to visitors.”&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, P. (ed.) 2006. Messages and Meaning. Johannesburg: David Krut Publishing.{{ISBN|0-9584860-6-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbs has also contributed to a well-known South African art publication, Taxi. Along with this involvement, she frequently writes the corresponding TAXI Art Education Supplement for school teachers and learners - allowing the information to be easily accessible. These supplements contain worksheets, information boxes about otherwise challenging art concepts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.davidkrutpublishing.com/taxi.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Van der Horst was born in [[Driebergen]], the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Biographical note, ''NIAS Newsletter'' 37, Fall 2006, Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences, p. 34 [http://www.nias.knaw.nl/en/new_3/new_1/fall_2006/NIAS+fall+news+37.pdf online.]&lt;/ref&gt; He studied [[classical philology]] and received a [[doctorate]] in [[theology]] in 1978. From 1969 to 2006, he was a [[research assistant]], [[Academic rank#Academic ranks|junior and senior lecturer]], and [[full professor]] at the Faculty of Theology of [[Utrecht University]].&lt;ref&gt;Pieter Willem van der Horst, ''Jews and Christians in Their Graeco-Roman Context'' (Mohr Siebeck, 2006), author's note,  p. iv [https://books.google.com/books?id=-AfzCmGh3fsC&amp;pg=PR4 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; He is an editor of the series Commentaries on Early Jewish Literature, published by [[Walter de Gruyter]],&lt;ref&gt;''NIAS Newsletter'' 37, Fall 2006, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; and is a member of the [[Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="online"&gt;Manfred Gerstenfeld, "Utrecht University: The Myth of Jewish Cannibalism, Censorship, and Fear of Muslim Intimidation," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, September 2008, [http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=381&amp;PID=470&amp;IID=2632 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/members/4281 |title=Piet van der Horst |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=='Jewish cannibalism' controversy==
:''See also: [[Blood libel]] and [[Islam and antisemitism]].''
In 2006, van der Horst became embroiled in a controversy over his [[retirement]] lecture, "The [[Myth]] of [[Blood libel|Jewish Cannibalism]]," which traced the development of this [[antisemitic]] theme from the [[Hellenistic period]] through the [[Middle Ages]] to [[Nazism]]. He planned to conclude by examining the resurgence of the [[cannibalism]] myth in contemporary [[Islamic]] [[Mass media|media]], including [[cartoon]]s, [[television program]]s, and [[sermon]]s, particularly in [[Iran]], [[Syria]], and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;Carine Cassuto, "Academic Censorship in the Netherlands," FrontPageMagazine.com, 12-05-2006, [http://frontpagemagazine.com/Articles/Printable.aspx?GUID=806D6E66-E838-4F18-A4DD-EAA8548C1C19 view.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The text of the lecture was reviewed in advance by Utrecht University administrators. According to van der Horst, he was asked by the [[Dean (education)|dean of faculty]]&lt;ref&gt;The dean has not been named in [[English language|English-language]] sources consulted for this article.&lt;/ref&gt; to delete the passage on what he prefers to call "Islamic Jew hatred."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pieter W. van der Horst, "Tying Down [[Academic Freedom]]," ''Wall Street Journal'' 30 June 2006, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115163738782295106#printMode online.]&lt;/ref&gt; She found the contemporary portions of the lecture to be "[[Pamphlet#Etymology|pamphlet]]-like" and "unscientific."&lt;ref&gt;Jannetje Koelewijn, "'Ik ben niet bang en van censuur is geen sprake': Rector magnificus Gispen over zijn ingrijpen bij afscheidsrede," ''NRC Handelsblad'', 22 June 2006, English via [[Google Translate]].&lt;/ref&gt; When he declined to edit, the dean referred the matter to the ''[[Rector (academia)#Europe|rector magnificus]]'' Willem Hendrik Gispen, the university's chief administrator. Van der Horst was then asked to appear before a committee composed of the rector, two deans of faculty, and [[Bas de Gaay Fortman]], who holds Utrecht's unique [[Chair (academic)|chair]] of [[Political Economy]] of [[Human Rights]]. The administration, while not disputing van der Horst's reconstruction of the chain of events, has maintained that he misunderstood the content of that meeting.&lt;ref name="Koelewijn, Rector magnificus."&gt;Koelewijn, "Rector magnificus."&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Horst says that he was given three reasons for editing his lecture:

{{cquote|They claimed it was too dangerous to give the complete lecture because it might trigger violent reactions from 'well-organized [[Muslim]] student groups' for which the rector could not take any responsibility. The committee also said it feared my speech would thwart efforts at bridge-building between Muslims and non-Muslims at the university. Finally, they claimed my lecture was far below the university's scholarly standards.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;}}
 
Van der Horst said that he was given 24 hours to edit the lecture, and left the meeting "in a state of total confusion." In a [[Column (newspaper)|guest column]] for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', he wrote that he had decided, with no independent means to verify any potential risk to himself or others, to proceed with an expurgated version. Because of the challenge to his academic reputation, he said, he also asked several colleagues, including three professors of [[Islamic Studies]] he left unnamed, to review his work from a scholarly perspective. According to van der Horst, none found weakness in the scholarship, nor any statements offensive to [[Islam]], [[Muhammad]], or the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Van der Horst delivered his "castrated"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; valedictory speech 16 June 2006.

===Media reaction===
The next day, the incident began to receive Dutch [[media coverage]]. The deleted passages were published by the daily [[newspaper]] ''[[Trouw]]'',&lt;ref name="online"/&gt; which had been contacted by van der Horst's fellow professors. These included passages that van der Horst himself identified as "[[polemic]]" involving the connection between German [[fascism]] and "Islamic vilification of Jews" in the contemporary [[Middle East]], with statements such as "the [[Islamization|Islamisation]] of European antisemitism is one of the most frightening developments of the past decades."&lt;ref&gt;Van der Horst, "Tying Down Academic Freedom"; Gerstenfeld, "Utrecht University," where a sample passage involving [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]] is reprinted.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22, ''rector magnificus'' Gispen responded to the controversy in an interview with ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', another Dutch daily. Gispen maintained that neither "[[Islamophobia]]" nor [[censorship]] was at issue, but rather the quality of van der Horst's work. He attributed van der Horst's response to resentment over having to retire and the "[[marginalization]]" of his [[academic department]].&lt;ref name="Koelewijn, Rector magnificus."/&gt;

[[File:TheoVanGogh.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], murdered filmmaker]]
Van der Horst's ''Wall Street Journal'' column was published June 30. In it, he asserted that despite the publication of the unexpurgated version of his lecture in multiple media outlets, he "did not receive a single negative, let alone threatening, Muslim reaction," though some had criticized him for overgeneralization.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
[[File:Debye100.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Peter Debye]], Dutch Nobel laureate]]
Critics interpreted the university's reaction as part of an [[appeasement|excessively conciliatory response]] to a perceived [[Islamism|Islamist]] agenda following the murder of Dutch filmmaker [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] by a [[Islamic Extremism|Muslim extremist]] in late 2004 and subsequent threats against [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|Dutch parliamentarian]] [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], who [[emigration|emigrated]] to the [[United States]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Cassuto, "Academic Censorship in the Netherlands,"; Paul Belien, "Coping with Islam: Censorship in Dutch Academia," ''The Brussels Journal'' 07-03-2006, [http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/1145 view.]&lt;/ref&gt; The incident has been compared to Utrecht University's handling of accusations against [[Peter Debye]], the [[Nobel laureate]] after whom the university's Institute of Physics &amp; Chemistry had been named. Debye's name was removed following allegations that he had collaborated with the Nazis while director of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] in [[Berlin]] during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Carine Cassuto, "Academic Censorship in the Netherlands", stating that the charges against Debye were untrue and evidence of academic censorship; Gerstenfeld, "Utrecht University," with the view that the actions against Debye were justified by his Nazi connections. See extensive treatment of the subject at [[Peter Debye#War activities and controversies|Peter Debye: War activities and controversies]].&lt;/ref&gt; Gispen himself acknowledged that his position toward van der Horst's lecture had been influenced by the Debye controversy.&lt;ref name="Koelewijn, Rector magnificus."/&gt;

Dutch media covered the controversy through news stories and in [[editorial]]s; the positions of both the rector and van der Horst received support.&lt;ref&gt;Gerstenfeld, "Utrecht University,"&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy also received attention from [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] [[blog]]s that deal with antisemitism or with the effects of "Islamophobia" on [[academic freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [[Dhimmi]] Watch in FrontPageMag.com, [http://www.jihadwatch.org/dhimmiwatch/archives/011873.php "Dutch professor censored for daring to criticize Islam"]; Kesher Talk, self-described as having "a hawkish liberal Jewish perspective," 6 July 2006, [http://www.keshertalk.com/archives/2006/07/wackademics_cen.php "Eurabia Here We Come: Wackademics Censor the Truth in the Netherlands"]; and NoolaBeulah (12-05-2006) [http://noolabeulah.blogspot.com/2006/12/limits-of-academic-freedom-netherlands.html "Limits of academic freedom,"] all supporting van der Horst; Demagogue, [http://demagogue.blogspot.com/2006_06_01_demagogue_archive.html "Gadfly or Victim?"], presenting both sides of the issue.&lt;/ref&gt; French media are alleged to have underreported the incident, but French commentator [[Paul Landau]] stated strongly that in his opinion it "illustrated the level of '[[dhimmitude]]' elite universities in many European countries have come to today. … Wake up, [[Erasmus]], they've become fools."&lt;ref&gt;"L’affaire Van Der Horst illustre à mon avis le niveau de dhimmitude auquel sont parvenues les élites universitaires dans de nombreux pays d’Europe aujourd’hui. … Erasme, réveille-toi, ils sont devenus fous." Paul Landau, "Retour sur l'affaire Van Der Horst: [[Eurabia]] et la mise au pas des universités européennes," republished by [http://www.theaugeanstables.com/2006/07/26/laffaire-van-der-horst-eurabia-and-the-european-academy The Augean Stables], referring to the Dutch [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] who was one of the leading figures of the [[northern Europe]]an Renaissance and the author of ''[[The Praise of Folly]]''. Public comments also available at the site.&lt;/ref&gt;

Van der Horst went on to publish "The Myth of Jewish Cannibalism: A Chapter in the History of Antisemitism" in ''Proceedings of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities (English Series)'', vol. 8 (2008). He traces the origin of the belief — that Jews murder a non-Jew each year to ritually consume the entrails and blood — to [[Apion]], a 1st-century [[Alexandrian school|Alexandrian]] scholar who constructed the myth as a conflict between the civilizing [[ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian deity]] [[Isis]] and the [[God in Judaism|god of the Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://www.academy.ac.il/english/asp/catalog/catalog_in_eng.asp?book_id=545 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4904">'''Product stewardship''' is where environmental, health, and safety protection centers on the product itself, and everyone involved in the lifespan of the product is called upon to take up responsibility to reduce its environmental, health, and safety impacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/epr/ The United States Environment Protection Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;  For manufacturers, this includes planning for, and if necessary, paying for the recycling or disposal of the product at the end of its useful life. This may be achieved, in part, by redesigning products to use fewer harmful substances, to be more durable, reusable and recyclable, and to make products from recycled materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-ncec.com/productstewardship/intro The National Chemical Emergency Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528102118/http://www.the-ncec.com/productstewardship/intro/ |date=2007-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For retailers and consumers, this means taking an active role in ensuring the proper disposal or recycling of an end-of-life product.

Those who advocate it are concerned with the later phases of [[Product lifecycle (marketing)|product lifecycle]] and the [[comprehensive outcome]] of the whole production process.  It is considered a pre-requisite to a strict [[service economy]] interpretation of (fictional, national, legal) "commodity" and "product" relationships.

The most familiar example is the [[container-deposit legislation]].  A fee is paid to buy the bottle, separately from the fee to buy what it contains.  If the bottle is returned, the fee is returned, and the supplier must return the bottle for re-use or [[recycling]].  If not, the collected fee can be used to pay for [[landfill]] or [[litter]] control measures.  Also, since the same fee can be collected by anyone finding and returning the bottle, it is common for people to collect these and return them as a means of surviving.  This is quite common for instance among [[homeless]] people in [[United States|U.S.]] cities.

However, the principle is applied very broadly beyond bottles to [[paint]] and [[automobile]] parts such as [[tire]]s.  When purchasing paint or tires in many places, one simultaneously pays for the disposal of the [[toxic waste]] they become.  In some countries, such as [[Germany]], [[law]] requires attention to the [[comprehensive outcome]] of the whole extraction, production, distribution, use and waste of a product, and holds those profiting from these legally responsible for any outcome along the way.  This is also the trend in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[European Union|EU]] generally.  In the [[United States]], the issue has been confronted via [[class action suit|class action lawsuits]] that attempt to hold companies [[Legal liability|liable]] for the environmental impact of their products.  Thus far, such as [[litigation]] or proposed [[accounting reform]]s such as [[full cost accounting]] have not gained much traction for the product stewardship concept in the United States beyond the realm of [[academe]] and corporate [[public relations]] (derisively referred to as [[greenwashing]]). 

The [[Demand|demand-side]] approach [[ethical consumerism]], supported by consumer education and information about environmental impacts, may approach some of the same outcomes as product stewardship.

== Extended producer responsibility ==

Product Stewardship is often used interchangeably with [[Extended producer responsibility]], a similar concept. However, there are distinct differences between the two, as suggested by the semantics of the different terms used. 

While both concepts bring the onus of waste management for end-of-life products from the government to the manufacturers, Product Stewardship further extends this responsibility to everyone involved in the life-cycle of the product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilsr.org/recycling/epr/index.html Waste to Wealth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310194722/http://www.ilsr.org/recycling/epr/index.html |date=2012-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes not only the manufacturers, but also the retailers, consumers and recyclers as well.

== Roles ==

'''Auditor''': Quality engineers may be responsible for auditing their own companies or their suppliers for compliance to international quality standards such as [[ISO9000]] and [[AS9100]]. They may also be independent auditors under an auditing body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://committee.iso.org/sites/tc176sc2/home/page/iso-9001-auditing-practices-grou.html|title=ISO 9001 Auditing Practices Group|website=committee.iso.org|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Process quality''': Quality engineers may be tasked with value stream mapping and statistical process control to determine if a process is likely to produce defective product. They may create inspection plans and criteria to ensure defective parts are detected prior to completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.automotiveengineeringhq.com/process-quality-engineer/|title=Process Quality Engineer|website=''automotiveengineeringhq.com''|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supplier quality''': Quality engineers may be responsible for auditing suppliers or performing root cause and corrective action at their facility or overseeing such activity to prevent the delivery of defective product.

== Software ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
IT services are increasingly interlinked in workflows across platform boundaries, device and organisational boundaries, for example in cyber-physical systems, business-to-business workflows or when using cloud services. In such contexts, quality engineering facilitates the necessary all-embracing consideration of quality attributes.

In such contexts an "end-to-end" view of quality from management to operation is vital. Quality engineering integrates methods and tools from [[enterprise architecture]]-management, [[Software product management]], [[IT service management]], [[software engineering]] and [[systems engineering]], and from [[software quality management]] and [[information security management]]. This means that quality engineering goes beyond the classic disciplines of software engineering, information security management or software product management since it integrates management issues (such as business and IT strategy, risk management, business process views, knowledge and information management, operative performance management), design considerations (including the [[software development process]], [[requirements analysis]], [[software testing]]) and operative considerations (such as configuration, monitoring, [[IT service management]]). In many of the fields where it is used, quality engineering is closely linked to compliance with legal and business requirements, contractual obligations and standards. As far as quality attributes are concerned, reliability, security and safety of IT services play a predominant role.

In quality engineering, quality objectives are implemented in a collaborative process. This process requires the interaction of largely independent actors whose knowledge is based on different sources of information.

[[File:Quality Engineering.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2.0|Quality engineering]]

== Quality objectives ==

[[Quality objectives]] describe basic requirements for [[software quality]]. In quality engineering they often address the quality attributes of availability, security, safety, reliability and performance. With the help of quality models like ISO/IEC 25000 and methods like the [[GQM|Goal Question Metric]] approach it is possible to attribute metrics to quality objectives. This allows measuring the degree of attainment of quality objectives. This is a key component of the quality engineering process and, at the same time, is a prerequisite for its continuous monitoring and control. To ensure effective and efficient measuring of quality objectives the integration of core numbers, which were identified manually (e.g. by expert estimates or reviews), and automatically identified metrics (e.g. by statistical analysis of source codes or automated regression tests) as a basis for decision-making is favourable.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | journal=Proceedings of the 32nd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering |author1=Michael Kläs |author2=Frank Elberzhager |author3=Jürgen Münch |author4=Klaus Hartjes |author5=Olaf von Graevemeyer | title=Transparent combination of expert and measurement data for defect prediction: an industrial case study | accessdate=8 April 2014 | date=2–8 May 2010 | publisher=ACM New York, USA | volume=2 | url=http://www.klaes.org/Z-files/Klaes-2010-ICSE-Paper.pdf | pages=119–128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Actors ==

The end-to-end quality management approach to quality engineering requires numerous actors with different responsibilities and tasks, different expertise and involvement in the organisation.

Different roles involved in quality engineering:
* Business architect, 
* IT architect, 
* Security officer, 
* Requirements engineer, 
* Software quality manager,
* Test manager,
* Project manager,
* Product manager and 
* Security architect.

Typically, these roles are distributed over geographic and organisational boundaries. Therefore, appropriate measures need to be taken to coordinate the heterogeneous tasks of the various roles in quality engineering and to consolidate and synchronize the data and information necessary in fulfilling the tasks, and to make them available to each actor in an appropriate form.

== Knowledge management ==

[[Knowledge management]] plays an important part in quality engineering.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | journal=IEEE Software |author1=Jacek Czerwonka |author2=Nachiappan Nagappan |author3=Wolfram Schulte |author4=Brendan Murphy | title=CODEMINE: Building a Software Development Data Analytics Platform at Microsoft | accessdate=7 April 2014 | date=July–August 2013 | publisher=IEEE Computer Society | volume=30 | number=4 | url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/200717/CodeMine.pdf | pages=64–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality engineering knowledge base comprises manifold structured and unstructured data, ranging from code repositories via requirements specifications, standards, test reports, enterprise architecture models to system configurations and runtime logs. Software and system models play an important role in mapping this knowledge. The data of the quality engineering knowledge base are generated, processed and made available both manually as well as tool-based in a geographically, organisationally and technically distributed context. Of prime importance is the focus on [[quality assurance]] tasks, early recognition of risks, and appropriate support for the collaboration of actors.

This results in the following requirements for a quality engineering knowledge base:

* Knowledge is available in a quality as required. Important quality criteria include that knowledge is consistent and up-to-date as well as complete and adequate in terms of granularity in relation to the tasks of the appropriate actors.
* Knowledge is interconnected and traceable in order to support interaction between the actors and to facilitate analysis of data. Such traceability relates not only to interconnectedness of data across different levels of abstraction (e.g. connection of requirements with the services realizing them) but also to their traceability over time periods, which is only possible if appropriate versioning concepts exist. Data can be interconnected both manually as well as (semi-) automatically.
* Information has to be available in a form that is consistent with the [[domain knowledge]] of the appropriate actors. Therefore, the knowledge base has to provide adequate mechanisms for information transformation (e.g. aggregation) and visualization. The [[RACI matrix|RACI]] concept is an example of an appropriate model for assigning actors to information in a quality engineering knowledge base.
* In contexts, where actors from different organisations or levels interact with each other, the quality engineering knowledge base has to provide mechanisms for ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
* Quality engineering knowledge bases offer a whole range of possibilities for analysis and finding information in order to support quality control tasks of actors.

== Collaborative processes ==

The quality engineering process comprises all tasks carried out manually and in a (semi-)automated way to identify, fulfil and measure any quality features in a chosen context. The process is a highly collaborative one in the sense that it requires interaction of actors, widely acting independently from each other.

The quality engineering process has to integrate any existing sub-processes that may comprise highly structured processes such as [[IT service management]] and processes with limited structure such as [[agile software development]]. Another important aspect is change-driven procedure, where change events, such as changed requirements are dealt with in the local context of information and actors affected by such change. A pre-requisite for this is methods and tools, which support change propagation and change handling.

The objective of an efficient quality engineering process is the coordination of automated and manual [[quality assurance]] tasks. Code review or elicitation of quality objectives are examples of manual tasks, while regression tests and the collection of code metrics are examples for automatically performed tasks. The quality engineering process (or its sub-processes) can be supported by tools such as ticketing systems or security management tools.

[[File:Bauxite bedarieux herault.jpg|thumb|[[Bauxite]], an aluminum ore ([[Hérault]] department, [[France]]). The reddish color is  due to [[iron oxides]] that make up the main part of the red mud.]]

'''Red mud''', also known as '''[[bauxite tailings]]''', '''red sludge''', bauxite residue, or alumina refinery residues (ARR), is a highly alkaline [[waste]] product composed mainly of iron oxide that is generated in the industrial production of [[alumina]] (aluminium oxide, the principal raw material used in the manufacture of [[aluminium]] metal and also widely used in the manufacture of ceramics, abrasives and refractories). Annually, about 77 million tons of the red [[hazardous material|special waste]] are produced, causing serious disposal problem in the [[mining]] industry.&lt;ref name="Ayr"&gt;Ayres, R. U., Holmberg, J., Andersson, B., "Materials and the global environment: Waste mining in the 21st century", MRS Bull. 2001, 26, 477.  {{DOI|10.1557/mrs2001.119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scale of production makes the waste product an important one, and issues with its storage are reviewed and every opportunity is explored to find uses for it.  

Over 95% of the alumina produced globally is through the [[Bayer process]]; for every tonne of alumina produced, approximately 1 to 1.5 tonnes of bauxite tailings/residue are also produced.  Annual production of alumina in 2015 was approximately 115 million tonnes resulting in the generation of about 150 million tonnes of bauxite tailings/residue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-aluminium.org/statistics/alumina-production/ Annual statistics collected and published by World Aluminium].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Red mud is a side-product of the [[Bayer process]], the principal means of refining [[bauxite]] en route to [[alumina]]. The resulting alumina is the raw material for producing [[aluminium]] by the [[Hall–Héroult process]].&lt;ref name="hand"&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WvT2OEf8DskC&amp;pg=PA18 | pages = 18 | chapter = Red Mud Disposal | title = Handbook of aluminium recycling | isbn = 978-3-8027-2936-2 | author1 = Schmitz, Christoph | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical bauxite plant produces one to two times as much red mud as alumina. This ratio is dependent on the type of bauxite used in the refining process and the extraction conditions.&lt;ref name="waste" /&gt;

Red mud is composed of a mixture of solid and [[metal]]lic oxides. The [[red]] colour arises from [[iron oxide]]s, which comprise up to 60% of the mass. The mud is highly [[base (chemistry)|basic]] with a [[pH]] ranging from 10 to 13.&lt;ref name="hand"/&gt;&lt;ref name="waste"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indust"/&gt; In addition to iron, the other dominant components include [[silica]], unleached residual alumina, and [[titanium oxide]].&lt;ref name=Ayr/&gt;

There are over 60 manufacturing operations across the world using the [[Bayer process]] to make [[alumina]] from [[bauxite]] ore.  Bauxite ore is mined, normally in open cast mines, and transferred to an alumina refinery for processing.  To extract the alumina, the soluble part of the bauxite ore is dissolved using sodium hydroxide under conditions of high temperature and pressure.  The insoluble part of the bauxite (the residue) is removed, giving rise to a solution of [[sodium aluminate]], which is then seeded and allowed to cool and [[aluminium hydroxide]] precipitates from the solution. Though some of the aluminium hydroxide is then returned and used to seed the next batch, the remainder is calcined (heated) at over 1000&amp;nbsp;°C in rotary kilns or fluid flash calciners to produce aluminium oxide (alumina). The alumina content of the bauxite used is normally about 50% but ores with a much wider range of alumina contents can be used; the aluminium compound may be present as [[gibbsite]] (Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[boehmite]] (AlOOH) or [[diaspore]] (AlOOH).  The tailings/residue invariably has a high concentration of [[iron oxide]] which gives the product a characteristic red colour.  A small residual amount of the sodium hydroxide used in the process remains with the tailings, causing the material to have a high pH/alkalinity, normally &gt;12. Various stages in the solid/liquid separation process are introduced to recycle as much sodium hydroxide as possible from the residue back into the Bayer Process in order to make the process as efficient as possible and reduce production costs. This also lowers the final alkalinity of the tailings making it easier to handle.

==Composition==
The main constituents of the residue after the extraction of the aluminium component are unreacted metallic oxides. The percentage of these oxides produced by a particular alumina refinery will depend on the quality and nature of the bauxite ore and the extraction conditions. The table below shows the composition ranges for common chemical constituents, but the values vary widely:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Chemical !! Percentage composition
|-
| Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || 5–60%
|-

|}

The objective is to remove as much of the aluminium containing component as economically possible. In general, the composition of the residue reflects that of the non-aluminium components, with the exception of part of the silicon component: crystalline silica (quartz) will not react but some of the silica present, often termed, reactive silica, will react under the extraction conditions and form sodium aluminium silicate.

=== Environmental hazards ===
Discharge of red mud is hazardous environmentally because of its [[alkalinity]].

In October 2010, approximately one million cubic meters of red mud from an [[alumina]] plant near [[Kolontár]] in [[Hungary]] was accidentally released into the surrounding countryside in the [[Ajka alumina plant accident]], killing ten people and contaminating a large area.&lt;ref name=npr100510&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/10/05/130351938/red-sludge-from-hungarian-aluminum-plant-spill-an-ecological-disaster "Toxic Red Sludge Spill From Hungarian Aluminum Plant 'An Ecological Disaster'"], David Gura, NPR, October 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; All life in the [[Marcal]] river was said to have been "extinguished" by the red mud, and within days the mud had reached the [[Danube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Hungarian chemical sludge spill reaches Danube | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11491412| newspaper = BBC| date = 7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Residue storage areas (RSA)==
Tailings storage methods have changed substantially since the original plants were built. The practice in early years was to pump the tailings slurry, at a concentration of about 20% solids, into lagoons or ponds sometimes created in former bauxite mines or depleted quarries. In other cases, impoundments were constructed with dams or [[levee]]s, whilst for some operations valleys were dammed and the tailings deposited in these holding areas.&lt;ref&gt;K. Evans, E. Nordheim and K. Tsesmelis, "Bauxite Residue Management", Light Metals, 63–66 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also common practice for the tailings to be discharged into rivers, estuaries, or the sea via pipelines or barges; in other instances the residue was shipped out to sea and disposed of in deep ocean trenches many kilometres offshore. All disposal in the sea, estuaries and rivers has now stopped.&lt;ref&gt;G. Power, M. Graefe and C. Klauber, "Bauxite residue issues: Current Management, Disposal and Storage Practices", Hydrometallurgy, 108, 33–45 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; As residue storage space ran out and concern increased over wet storage, since the mid-1980s dry stacking has been increasingly adopted.&lt;ref&gt;B. G. Purnell, “Mud Disposal at the Burntisland Alumina Plant”. Light Metals, 157–159. (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Pohland and A. J. Tielens, “Design and Operation on Non-decanted Red Mud Ponds in Ludwigshafen”, Proc. Int. Conf. Bauxite Tailings, Kingston, Jamaica (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. I. Robinsky, “Current Status of the Sloped Thickened Tailings Disposal System”, Proc. Int. Conf. Bauxite Tailings, Kingston, Jamaica (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Chandler, “The Stacking and Solar Drying Process for disposal of bauxite tailings in Jamaica”, Proc. Int. Conf. Bauxite Tailings, Kingston, Jamaica (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; In this method, tailings are thickened to a high density slurry (48-55% solids or higher), and then deposited in a way that it consolidates and dries.&lt;ref&gt;“Bauxite Residue Management: Best Practice”, published by World Aluminium the European Aluminium available from the International Aluminium Institute, 10 King Charles II Street, London, SW1Y 4AA, UK and on line from http://bauxite.world-aluminium.org/refining/bauxite-residue-management.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

An increasing popular storage method is filtration whereby a filter cake (typically &lt;30% solids) is produced. This cake can be washed with either water or steam to reduce alkalinity before being transported and stored as a semi-dried material.&lt;ref&gt;K. S. Sutherland, "Solid/Liquid Separation Equipment", Wiley-VCH, Weinheim (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  Residue produced in this form is ideal for reuse as it has lower alkalinity, is cheaper to transport, and is easier to handle and process.

==Use==

Since the [[Bayer process]] was first adopted industrially in 1894, the value of the remaining oxides has been recognised. Attempts have been made to recover the principal components – especially iron. Since mining began, an enormous amount of research effort has been devoted to seeking uses for the residue. 

Many studies have been conducted to develop uses of red mud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Sanjay|last2=Kumar|first2=Rakesh|last3=Bandopadhyay|first3=Amitava|date=2006-10-01|title=Innovative methodologies for the utilisation of wastes from metallurgical and allied industries|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344906000401|journal=Resources, Conservation and Recycling|volume=48|issue=4|pages=301–314|doi=10.1016/j.resconrec.2006.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 2 to 3 million tonnes are used annually in the production of cement,&lt;ref&gt;Y.

As they are lateral extensions of a single cell and only rarely branched, they are visible to the naked eye and light microscope. They are found only in the region of maturation of the root. Just prior to, and during, root hair cell development, there is elevated [[phosphorylase]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Dosier|first1=Larry W.|last2=Riopel|first2=J. L.|title=Differential Enzyme Activity During Trichoblast Differentiation in Elodea Canadensis|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=64|issue=9|pages=1049–1056|language=en|doi=10.1002/j.1537-2197.1977.tb10794.x|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
The root hairs are where most water absorption happens. They are long and so they can penetrate between soil particles, and prevent harmful bacterial organisms from entering the plant through the xylem vessels. They have a large surface area for absorption of water. Increasing root surface area aids plants to be more efficient in absorbing nutrients and establishing relationships with microbes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3243358/|title=Root Hairs|journal=The Arabidopsis Book|volume=1|pages=e0060|pmc=3243358|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|doi=10.1199/tab.0060|pmid=22303213|year=2002|last1=Grierson|first1=C.|last2=Schiefelbein|first2=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cross-section of root hair cell: a roughly rectangular shape with a long, thin tail extending to the right and a nucleus at the top left.
Water passes from the soil water to the root hair cell’s cytoplasm by osmosis. This happens because the soil water has a higher water potential than the root hair cell cytoplasm. The function of root hairs is to collect water and mineral [[nutrient]]s present in the soil and take this solution up through the roots to the rest of the plant. As root hair cells do not carry out [[photosynthesis]] they do not contain [[chloroplasts]].

==Formation==
Root hair cells are outgrowths at a tip of the plant's roots. Root hair cells vary between 15 and 17 micrometres in diameter, and 80 to 1,500 micrometres in length.&lt;ref&gt;Dittmar, cited in Esau, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; They are found only in the zone of maturation, and not the zone of elongation, possibly because any root hairs that arise are sheared off as the root elongates and moves through the soil. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
Root hairs grow quickly, at least 1μm/min, making them particularly useful for research on cell expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Grierson|first1=Claire|last2=Schiefelbein|first2=John|title=Root Hairs|journal=The Arabidopsis Book|volume=1|pages=e0060|doi=10.1199/tab.0060|pmid=22303213|pmc=3243358|date=1 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
Root hairs form an important surface as they are needed to [[Absorption of water|absorb]] most of the water and nutrients needed for the plant.
They are also directly involved in the formation of root nodules in [[Fabaceae|legume]] plants. The root hairs curl around the bacteria which allows for the formation of an infection thread through into the dividing cortical cells to form the nodule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Mergaert|first1=Peter|last2=Uchiumi|first2=Toshiki|last3=Alunni|first3=Benoît|last4=Evanno|first4=Gwénaëlle|last5=Cheron|first5=Angélique|last6=Catrice|first6=Olivier|last7=Mausset|first7=Anne-Elisabeth|last8=Barloy-Hubler|first8=Frédérique|last9=Galibert|first9=Francis|last10=Kondorosi|first10=Adam|last11=Kondorosi|first11=Eva|title=Eukaryotic control on bacterial cell cycle and differentiation in the Rhizobium–legume symbiosis|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/103/13/5230|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=103|issue=13|accessdate=23 April 2018|pages=5230–5235|language=en|doi=10.1073/pnas.0600912103|pmid=16547129|pmc=1458823|date=28 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having a large surface area, the [[active uptake]] of water and minerals through root hairs is highly efficient. 
Root hair cells also secrete acid (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from [[malic acid]]) which exchanges and helps solubilize the minerals into ionic form, making the ions easier to absorb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Gerke|first1=Jörg|last2=Römer|first2=Wilhelm|last3=Jungk|first3=Albrecht|title=The excretion of citric and malic acid by proteoid roots ofLupinus albus L.; effects on soil solution concentrations of phosphate, iron, and aluminum in the proteoid rhizosphere in samples of an oxisol and a luvisol|journal=Zeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde|volume=157|issue=4|pages=289–294|language=en|doi=10.1002/jpln.19941570408|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Root hair cells can survive for 2 to 3 weeks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prezi.com/4piuz-b_6dgs/root-hair-cells/|title=Root hair cells|website=prezi.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then die off, at the same time new root hair cells are continually being formed at the tip of the root. This way, the root hair coverage stays the same. When a new root hair cell grows, it excretes a poison so that the other cells in close proximity to it are unable to grow one of these hairs. This ensures equal and efficient distribution of the actual hairs on these cells. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The act of re-potting or transplanting a plant can result in root hair cells being pulled off, perhaps to a significant extent, and such plants may therefore wilt for some time as a result.

'''Willowbank''' is an independent educational institution located on the Willowbank [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site]] and in the village centre of [[Queenston, Ontario]], along the Canada-United States border. It operates a School of Restoration Arts which offers a three-year post-secondary diploma in conservation skills and theory, and a Centre for Cultural Landscape, a forum for [[cultural landscape]] theory and practice in Canada and the world. Willowbank was created from the rescue of a 19th-century estate which today forms the centre of its campus, and it is one of a handful of Canadian organisations of which His Royal Highness [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]] is [[List of Canadian organizations with royal patronage|Royal Patron]].

==School of Restoration Arts==

Founded in 2006, the School of Restoration Arts offers a three-year, post-secondary Diploma in Heritage Conservation which combines academic and apprenticeship learning, taught by over 50 faculty associates who are leading practitioners in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.willowbank.ca/asset/1970/Willowbank_Release.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031135/http://www.willowbank.ca/asset/1970/Willowbank_Release.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }} Press Release, The Prince of Wales becomes Royal Patron of Willowbank, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  The School accepts a maximum of 18 students each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willowbank.ca/content/beta/home/school-of-restoration-arts/program/admissions/index/] Willowbank Admissions&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centre for Cultural Landscape==

The Willowbank Centre for Cultural Landscape is an initiative that builds on its exploration of [[cultural landscape]] theory and practice to define a particularly Canadian perspective in this area of current discussion and debate. It facilitates a program of lecture series, workshops and publications to promote a connection between cultural landscape and cultural practice, and to advocate for its ecological view of cultural and natural heritage conservation. The Centre also coordinates Willowbank’s seat in global deliberations about conservation, whose participants include a cross-section of board, staff and students. In 2013, Willowbank signed an agreement with the [[UNESCO]]-affiliated World Heritage Institute in Shanghai, China, with a focus on the UNESCO Recommendation for Historic Urban Landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willowbank.ca/content/beta/home/about-us/new/new/ Willowbank agreement with UNESCO-affiliated World Heritage Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre was created in 2012 through a multi-year grant from the [[Ontario Trillium Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.otf.ca/school-restoration-arts-willowbank?redirected=1] Ontario Trillium Foundation, 2012-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==

Willowbank's campus is composed of two main parts, a 19th-century estate, and a former village elementary school with its surrounding lands. The former, described in further detail below, traces its history to 8,000 years of human habitation. The landscape of the estate includes a ravine and a hill upon which sits a 19th-century stone mansion. Newly built and re-built outbuildings have been constructed to house student workshops, including a barn and a forge and stone studio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willowbank.ca/content/beta/home/national-historic-site/index/#menu-2] Willowbank National Historic Site&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjacent to the estate is the former Laura Secord School in the centre of the village, bought in 2012 by Willowbank after it was abandoned. The transfer is designed to house school activities while also returning the building and lands to community use and creating affordable housing. Its original wing was constructed in 1914, with substantial additions made in the 1950s. The original, two-classroom building housed students upstairs while the lower level was a centre of village life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niagarafallsreview.ca/2012/03/22/willowbank-buys-old-laura-secord-school] Willowbank buys old Laura Secord School, Niagara Falls Review, March 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Field School==
Willowbank runs a three-week field school every summer in partnership with the Canova Association in the [[Ossola|Ossola Valley]] in Northern Italy. It is a microcosm of the diploma program, with an introduction to cultural landscape theory and practice, an experience of documentation and design, and then a major hands-on component. The work involves creative restoration and adaptive reuse of abandoned medieval stone structures, carried out under the direction of Italian masons and craftsmen. It coincides with the International Architect Encounter in the same place, an annual, intimate conference of world leaders in conservation and ecological design, with whom the field school’s participants are able to engage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willowbank.ca/content/beta/home/centre-for-cultural-landscape/short-courses/italy/index/] Willowbank Italy Field School&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Historic Site==

Willowbank's campus includes a designated [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site]] in the century estate to which it traces its name, also designated under Part IV of the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]'', and further protected by a heritage easement granted to The [[Ontario Heritage Trust]]. It is named after [[willow]] trees that were once located on its grounds, is an example of the rural estates of the wealthy settlers of early 19th century [[Upper Canada]]. Its mansion, which is the centre of campus, was built between 1832 and 1834 for Alexander Hamilton, third son of Robert Hamilton, one of the founders  of Upper Canada. Constructed in the [[Greek Revival]] style of [[architecture]] then at its height in North America for such grand houses, Willowbank's is an example of such buildings on the continent. Designed by architect, John Latshaw, and built of local [[Whirlpool]] [[sandstone]], the building is characterised by the rare features of eight hand-carved columns running its full two-story height, and by a front doorway of Greek design. The 13-acre estate today forms the centre of the Willowbank campus.

[[File:Deutsch-Verzeichnis 1978.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Deutsch-Verzeichnis 1978]]
'''''Schubert: Thematic Catalogue of all his Works in Chronological Order''''', also known as the '''Deutsch catalogue''', is a numbered list of all compositions by [[Franz Schubert]] compiled by [[Otto Erich Deutsch]]. Since its first publication in 1951, Deutsch (abbreviated as D or D.) numbers are used for the unique identification of Schubert's compositions.

==1951 edition==
The Deutsch catalogue was first published in London in 1951, as ''Schubert: Thematic Catalogue of all his Works in Chronological Order, compiled by O. E. Deutsch, in collaboration with Donald R. Wakeling.''

==1978 edition: NSE VIII/4==
In 1978, as part VIII Supplement / Volume 4 of the [[New Schubert Edition]] (NSE), an updated version of the catalogue was published in German.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

A few compositions that had been undated in the first edition received a new number (usually followed by a letter), e.g. {{D.|u|number=993}} was renumbered to {{D.|u|number=2E}}

==Later versions==
The original 1951 edition (in English) was re-issued several times, for instance in the United States by W. W. Norton. The 1978 version, published by Bärenreiter, had a double objective: it was not only a list of Schubert's works as such, it was also the compendium of all scores published by that publisher in the New Schubert Edition.

===New versions in English===
In 1995 [[Dover Publications]] republished the 1951 edition, with updates derived from scholarship that had been published since 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===New versions in German===
From 1983 compact versions of the catalogue appeared, edited by Werner Aderhold and others.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes to the numbering of Schubert's works were minor in these later editions.&lt;ref&gt;Aderhold 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21856">'''T-norm fuzzy logics''' are a family of [[non-classical logic]]s, informally delimited by having a [[semantics]] that takes the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] for the system of truth values and functions called [[t-norm]]s for permissible interpretations of [[logical conjunction|conjunction]]. They are mainly used in applied [[fuzzy logic]] and [[fuzzy set|fuzzy set theory]] as a theoretical basis for approximate reasoning.

T-norm fuzzy logics belong in broader classes of [[fuzzy logic]]s and [[many-valued logic]]s. In order to generate a well-behaved [[logical implication|implication]], the t-norms are usually required to be [[left-continuous]]; logics of left-continuous t-norms further belong in the class of [[substructural logic]]s, among which they are marked with the validity of the ''law of prelinearity'',  (''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''B'') &amp;or; (''B''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''A''). Both [[propositional logic|propositional]] and [[first-order logic|first-order]] (or [[higher-order logic|higher-order]]) t-norm fuzzy logics, as well as their expansions by [[Modal operator|modal]] and other operators, are studied. Logics that restrict the t-norm semantics to a subset of the real unit interval (for example, finitely valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]]s) are usually included in the class as well.

Important examples of t-norm fuzzy logics are [[monoidal t-norm logic|monoidal t-norm logic MTL]] of all left-continuous t-norms, [[BL (logic)|basic logic BL]] of all continuous t-norms, [[product fuzzy logic]] of the product t-norm, or the [[nilpotent minimum logic]] of the nilpotent minimum t-norm. Some independently motivated logics belong among t-norm fuzzy logics, too, for example Łukasiewicz logic (which is the logic of the Łukasiewicz t-norm) or [[intermediate logic|Gödel–Dummett logic]] (which is the logic of the minimum t-norm).

== Motivation ==

As members of the family of [[fuzzy logic]]s, t-norm fuzzy logics primarily aim at generalizing classical two-valued logic by admitting intermediary [[truth value]]s between 1 (truth) and 0 (falsity) representing ''degrees'' of truth of propositions. The degrees are assumed to be real numbers from the unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. In propositional t-norm fuzzy logics, [[propositional formula|propositional connectives]] are stipulated to be [[truth-functional]], that is, the truth value of a complex proposition formed by a propositional connective from some constituent propositions is a function (called the ''truth function'' of the connective) of the truth values of the constituent propositions. The truth functions operate on the set of truth degrees (in the standard semantics, on the [0,&amp;nbsp;1] interval); thus the truth function of an ''n''-ary propositional connective ''c'' is a function ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;: [0,&amp;nbsp;1]&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Truth functions generalize [[truth table]]s of propositional connectives known from classical logic to operate on the larger system of truth values.

T-norm fuzzy logics impose certain natural constraints on the truth function of [[logical conjunction|conjunction]]. The truth function &lt;math&gt;*\colon[0,1]^2\to[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; of conjunction is assumed to satisfy the following conditions:
* ''Commutativity'', that is, &lt;math&gt;x*y=y*x&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' and ''y'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This expresses the assumption that the order of fuzzy propositions is immaterial in conjunction, even if intermediary truth degrees are admitted.
* ''Associativity'', that is, &lt;math&gt;(x*y)*z = x*(y*z)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This expresses the assumption that the order of performing conjunction is immaterial, even if intermediary truth degrees are admitted.
* ''Monotony'', that is, if &lt;math&gt;x \le y&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x*z \le y*z&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This expresses the assumption that increasing the truth degree of a conjunct should not decrease the truth degree of the conjunction.
* ''Neutrality of 1'', that is, &lt;math&gt;1*x = x&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This assumption corresponds to regarding the truth degree 1 as full truth, conjunction with which does not decrease the truth value of the other conjunct. Together with the previous conditions this condition ensures that also &lt;math&gt;0*x = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1], which corresponds to regarding the truth degree 0 as full falsity, conjunction with which is always fully false.
* ''Continuity'' of the function &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; (the previous conditions reduce this requirement to the continuity in either argument). Informally this expresses the assumption that microscopic changes of the truth degrees of conjuncts should not result in a macroscopic change of the truth degree of their conjunction. This condition, among other things, ensures a good behavior of (residual) implication derived from conjunction; to ensure the good behavior, however, ''left''-continuity (in either argument) of the function &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is sufficient.&lt;ref name="EG2001"&gt;Esteva &amp;amp; Godo (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; In general t-norm fuzzy logics, therefore, only left-continuity of &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is required, which expresses the assumption that a microscopic ''decrease'' of the truth degree of a conjunct should not macroscopically decrease the truth degree of conjunction.

These assumptions make the truth function of conjunction a left-continuous [[t-norm]], which explains the name of the family of fuzzy logics (''t-norm based''). Particular logics of the family can make further assumptions about the behavior of conjunction (for example, [[Intermediate logic|Gödel logic]] requires its [[idempotence]]) or other connectives (for example, the logic IMTL requires the [[involution (mathematics)|involutiveness]] of negation).

All left-continuous t-norms &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; have a unique [[t-norm#Residuum|residuum]], that is, a binary function &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; such that for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1],
:&lt;math&gt;x*y\le z&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x\le y\Rightarrow z.&lt;/math&gt;
The residuum of a left-continuous t-norm can explicitly be defined as
:&lt;math&gt;(x\Rightarrow y)=\sup\{z\mid z*x\le y\}.&lt;/math&gt;
This ensures that the residuum is the pointwise largest function such that for all ''x'' and ''y'',
:&lt;math&gt;x*(x\Rightarrow y)\le y.&lt;/math&gt;
The latter can be interpreted as a fuzzy version of the [[modus ponens]] rule of inference. The residuum of a left-continuous t-norm thus can be characterized as the weakest function that makes the fuzzy modus ponens valid, which makes it a suitable truth function for implication in fuzzy logic. Left-continuity of the t-norm is the necessary and sufficient condition for this relationship between a t-norm conjunction and its residual implication to hold.

Truth functions of further propositional connectives can be defined by means of the t-norm and its residuum, for instance the residual negation &lt;math&gt;\neg x=(x\Rightarrow 0)&lt;/math&gt; or bi-residual equivalence &lt;math&gt;x\Leftrightarrow y = (x\Rightarrow y)*(y\Rightarrow x).&lt;/math&gt; Truth functions of propositional connectives may also be introduced by additional definitions: the most usual ones are the minimum (which plays a role of another conjunctive connective), the maximum (which plays a role of a disjunctive connective), or the Baaz Delta operator, defined in [0,&amp;nbsp;1] as &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = 1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = 0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise. In this way, a left-continuous t-norm, its residuum, and the truth functions of additional propositional connectives determine the truth values of complex propositional formulae in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

Formulae that always evaluate to 1 are called ''tautologies'' with respect to the given left-continuous t-norm &lt;math&gt;*,&lt;/math&gt; or ''&lt;math&gt;*\mbox{-}&lt;/math&gt;tautologies.'' The set of all &lt;math&gt;*\mbox{-}&lt;/math&gt;tautologies is called the ''logic'' of the t-norm &lt;math&gt;*,&lt;/math&gt; as these formulae represent the laws of fuzzy logic (determined by the t-norm) which hold (to degree 1) regardless of the truth degrees of [[atomic formula]]e. Some formulae are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] with respect to a larger class of left-continuous t-norms; the set of such formulae is called the logic of the class. Important t-norm logics are the logics of particular t-norms or classes of t-norms, for example:
* [[Łukasiewicz logic]] is the logic of the [[T-norm#Prominent examples|Łukasiewicz t-norm]] &lt;math&gt;x*y = \max(x+y-1,0)&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Intermediate logic|Gödel–Dummett logic]] is the logic of the [[T-norm#Prominent examples|minimum t-norm]] &lt;math&gt;x*y = \min(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Product fuzzy logic]] is the logic of the [[T-norm#Prominent examples|product t-norm]] &lt;math&gt;x*y = x\cdot y&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Monoidal t-norm logic]] MTL is the logic of (the class of) ''all'' left-continuous t-norms
* [[Basic fuzzy logic]] BL is the logic of (the class of) all ''continuous'' t-norms

It turns out that many logics of particular t-norms and classes of t-norms are axiomatizable. The completeness theorem of the axiomatic system with respect to the corresponding t-norm semantics on [0,&amp;nbsp;1] is then called the ''standard completeness'' of the logic. Besides the standard real-valued semantics on [0,&amp;nbsp;1], the logics are sound and complete with respect to general algebraic semantics, formed by suitable classes of prelinear commutative bounded integral [[residuated lattice]]s.

== History ==

Some particular t-norm fuzzy logics have been introduced and investigated long before the family was recognized (even before the notions of [[fuzzy logic]] or [[t-norm]] emerged):
* [[Łukasiewicz logic]] (the logic of the Łukasiewicz t-norm) was originally defined by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] (1920) as a [[three-valued logic]];&lt;ref name="Luk1920"&gt;Łukasiewicz J., 1920, O logice trojwartosciowej (Polish, On three-valued logic). Ruch filozoficzny '''5''':170–171.&lt;/ref&gt; it was later generalized to ''n''-valued (for all finite ''n'') as well as infinitely-many-valued variants, both propositional and first-order.&lt;ref name="Hay1963"&gt;Hay, L.S., 1963, Axiomatization of the infinite-valued predicate calculus. ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' '''28''':77–86.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Intermediate logic|Gödel–Dummett logic]] (the logic of the minimum t-norm) was implicit in [[Gödel]]'s 1932 proof of infinite-valuedness of [[intuitionistic logic]].&lt;ref name="Goe1932"&gt;Gödel K., 1932, Zum intuitionistischen Aussagenkalkül, ''Anzeiger Akademie der Wissenschaften Wien'' '''69''': 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Later (1959) it was explicitly studied by [[Michael Dummett|Dummett]] who proved a completeness theorem for the logic.&lt;ref name="Dum1959"&gt;Dummett M., 1959, Propositional calculus with denumerable matrix, ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' '''27''': 97–106&lt;/ref&gt;

A systematic study of particular t-norm fuzzy logics and their classes began with [[Petr Hájek|Hájek]]'s (1998) monograph ''Metamathematics of Fuzzy Logic'', which presented the notion of the logic of a continuous t-norm, the logics of the three basic continuous t-norms (Łukasiewicz, Gödel, and product), and the 'basic' fuzzy logic [[BL (logic)|BL]] of all continuous t-norms (all of them both propositional and first-order). The book also started the investigation of fuzzy logics as non-classical logics with Hilbert-style calculi, algebraic semantics, and metamathematical properties known from other logics (completeness theorems, deduction theorems, complexity, etc.).

Since then, a plethora of t-norm fuzzy logics have been introduced and their metamathematical properties have been investigated. Some of the most important t-norm fuzzy logics were introduced in 2001, by Esteva and Godo ([[monoidal t-norm logic|MTL]], IMTL, SMTL, NM, WNM),&lt;ref name="EG2001" /&gt; Esteva, Godo, and Montagna (propositional ŁΠ),&lt;ref name="EGM2001"&gt;Esteva F., Godo L., &amp; Montagna F., 2001, The ŁΠ and ŁΠ½ logics: Two complete fuzzy systems joining Łukasiewicz and product logics, ''Archive for Mathematical Logic'' '''40''': 39–67.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cintula (first-order ŁΠ).&lt;ref name="Cin2001"&gt;Cintula P., 2001, The ŁΠ and ŁΠ½ propositional and predicate logics, ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'' '''124''': 289–302.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logical language ==

The logical vocabulary of [[propositional logic|propositional]] t-norm fuzzy logics standardly comprises the following connectives:
* '''Implication''' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ([[arity|binary]]). In the context of other than t-norm-based fuzzy logics, the t-norm-based implication is sometimes called '''residual implication''' or '''R-implication''', as its standard semantics is the [[t-norm#Residuum|residuum]] of the [[t-norm]] that realizes strong conjunction.
* '''Strong conjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\And&lt;/math&gt; (binary). In the context of substructural logics, the sign &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; and the names ''group'', ''intensional'', ''multiplicative'', or ''parallel conjunction'' are often used for strong conjunction.
* '''Weak conjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; (binary), also called '''lattice conjunction''' (as it is always realized by the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] operation of [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] in algebraic semantics). In the context of substructural logics, the names ''additive'', ''extensional'', or ''comparative conjunction'' are sometimes used for lattice conjunction. In the logic [[BL (logic)|BL]] and its extensions (though not in t-norm logics in general), weak conjunction is definable in terms of implication and strong conjunction, by
::&lt;math&gt;A\wedge B \equiv A \mathbin{\And} (A \rightarrow B).&lt;/math&gt;
:The presence of two conjunction connectives is a common feature of contraction-free [[substructural logic]]s.
* '''Bottom''' &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; ([[nullary]]); &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\overline{0}&lt;/math&gt; are common alternative signs and '''zero''' a common alternative name for the propositional constant (as the constants bottom and zero of substructural logics coincide in t-norm fuzzy logics). The proposition &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; represents the ''falsity'' or ''absurdum'' and corresponds to the classical truth value ''false''.
* '''Negation''' &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt; ([[unary operation|unary]]), sometimes called '''residual negation''' if other negation connectives are considered, as it is defined from the residual implication by the reductio ad absurdum:
::&lt;math&gt;\neg A \equiv A \rightarrow \bot&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Equivalence''' &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (binary), defined as
::&lt;math&gt;A \leftrightarrow B \equiv (A \rightarrow B) \wedge (B \rightarrow A)&lt;/math&gt;
: In t-norm logics, the definition is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(A \rightarrow B) \mathbin{\And} (B \rightarrow A).&lt;/math&gt;
* '''(Weak) disjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; (binary), also called '''lattice disjunction''' (as it is always realized by the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] operation of [[join (mathematics)|join]] in algebraic semantics). In t-norm logics it is definable in terms of other connectives as
::&lt;math&gt;A \vee B \equiv ((A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow B) \wedge ((B \rightarrow A) \rightarrow A)&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Top''' &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; (nullary), also called '''one''' and denoted by &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\overline{1}&lt;/math&gt; (as the constants top and zero of substructural logics coincide in t-norm fuzzy logics). The proposition &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the classical truth value ''true'' and can in t-norm logics be defined as
::&lt;math&gt;\top \equiv \bot \rightarrow \bot.&lt;/math&gt;

Some propositional t-norm logics add further propositional connectives to the above language, most often the following ones:
* The '''Delta''' connective &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; is a unary connective that asserts classical truth of a proposition, as the formulae of the form &lt;math&gt;\triangle A&lt;/math&gt; behave as in classical logic. Also called the '''Baaz Delta''', as it was first used by Matthias Baaz for [[Intermediate logic|Gödel–Dummett logic]].&lt;ref name="Baa96"&gt;Baaz M., 1996, Infinite-valued Gödel logic with 0-1-projections and relativisations. In P. Hájek (ed.), ''Gödel'96: Logical Foundations of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics'', Springer, ''Lecture Notes in Logic'' '''6''': 23–33&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of a t-norm logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; by the Delta connective is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;L_{\triangle}.&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Truth constants''' are nullary connectives representing particular truth values between 0 and 1 in the standard real-valued semantics. For the real number &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the corresponding truth constant is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;\overline{r}.&lt;/math&gt; Most often, the truth constants for all rational numbers are added. The system of all truth constants in the language is supposed to satisfy the ''bookkeeping axioms'':&lt;ref name="Haj98"&gt;Hájek (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\overline{r \mathbin{\And} s} \leftrightarrow (\overline{r} \mathbin{\And} \overline{s}),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\overline{r \rightarrow s} \leftrightarrow (\overline{r} \mathbin{\rightarrow} \overline{s}),&lt;/math&gt; etc. for all propositional connectives and all truth constants definable in the language.
* '''Involutive negation''' &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; (unary) can be added as an additional negation to t-norm logics whose residual negation is not itself [[involution (mathematics)|involutive]], that is, if it does not obey the law of double negation &lt;math&gt;\neg\neg A \leftrightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;. A t-norm logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; expanded with involutive negation is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;L_{\sim}&lt;/math&gt; and called ''&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; with involution''.
* '''Strong disjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; (binary). In the context of substructural logics it is also called ''group'', ''intensional'', ''multiplicative'', or ''parallel disjunction''. Even though standard in contraction-free substructural logics, in t-norm fuzzy logics it is usually used only in the presence of involutive negation, which makes it definable (and so axiomatizable) by de Morgan's law from strong conjunction:
::&lt;math&gt;A \oplus B \equiv \mathrm{\sim}(\mathrm{\sim}A \mathbin{\And} \mathrm{\sim}B).&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Additional t-norm conjunctions and residual implications'''. Some expressively strong t-norm logics, for instance the logic [[ŁΠ]], have more than one strong conjunction or residual implication in their language. In the standard real-valued semantics, all such strong conjunctions are realized by different t-norms and the residual implications by their residua.

[[Well-formed formula]]e of propositional t-norm logics are defined from [[propositional variable]]s (usually [[countable|countably]] many) by the above logical connectives, as usual in [[propositional logic]]s. In order to save parentheses, it is common to use the following order of precedence:
* Unary connectives (bind most closely)
* Binary connectives other than implication and equivalence
* Implication and equivalence (bind most loosely)

First-order variants of t-norm logics employ the usual logical language of [[first-order logic]] with the above propositional connectives and the following [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s:
* '''General quantifier''' &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Existential quantifier''' &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;
The first-order variant of a propositional t-norm logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;L\forall.&lt;/math&gt;

== Semantics ==

[[Algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|Algebraic semantics]] is predominantly used for propositional t-norm fuzzy logics, with three main classes of [[algebraic structure|algebras]] with respect to which a t-norm fuzzy logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is [[completeness (logic)|complete]]:
* '''General semantics''', formed of all ''&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras'' — that is, all algebras for which the logic is [[Soundness theorem|sound]].
* '''Linear semantics''', formed of all ''linear'' &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras — that is, all &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras whose [[lattice (order)|lattice]] order is [[total order|linear]].
* '''Standard semantics''', formed of all ''standard'' &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras — that is, all &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras whose lattice reduct is the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] with the usual order. In standard &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras, the interpretation of strong conjunction is a left-continuous [[t-norm]] and the interpretation of most propositional connectives is determined by the t-norm (hence the names ''t-norm-based logics'' and ''t-norm &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras'', which is also used for &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras on the lattice [0,&amp;nbsp;1]). In t-norm logics with additional connectives, however, the real-valued interpretation of the additional connectives may be restricted by further conditions for the t-norm algebra to be called standard: for example, in standard &lt;math&gt;L_\sim&lt;/math&gt;-algebras of the logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; with involution, the interpretation of the additional involutive negation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is required to be the ''standard involution'' &lt;math&gt;f_\sim(x)=1-x,&lt;/math&gt; rather than other involutions which can also interpret &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; over t-norm &lt;math&gt;L_\sim&lt;/math&gt;-algebras.&lt;ref name="FM2006"&gt;Flaminio &amp; Marchioni (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In general, therefore, the definition of standard t-norm algebras has to be explicitly given for t-norm logics with additional connectives.

'''Vellum''' is prepared animal skin or "membrane" used as a material for writing on. The term is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''vitulinum'' meaning "made from calf", leading to [[Old French]] ''velin'' for "calfskin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=vellum|title=vellum|publisher=Online Etymological Dictionary|accessdate=2014-08-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904202532/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=vellum|archive-date=2014-09-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Parchment]] is another term for this material category.  If vellum is distinguished, it is by vellum being made from calf skin, as opposed to that from other animals,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/formats/paper-vellum.html | title=Differences between Parchment, Vellum and Paper | website=archives.gov | access-date=2016-06-16 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615030013/http://www.archives.gov/preservation/formats/paper-vellum.html | archive-date=2016-06-15 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or otherwise being of higher quality.&lt;ref name="esdaile"&gt;Stokes and Almagno 2001, 114&lt;/ref&gt;  Vellum is prepared as a surface for writing (or printing) to produce scrolls, single pages, [[Codex|codices]] or books. 

Modern scholars and custodians increasingly use only the safe, if confusing, term "membrane".&lt;ref name="esdaile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c&amp;g9"&gt;Clemens and Graham 2007, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on factors such as the method of preparation it may be very hard to determine the animal species involved (let alone its age) without using a laboratory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Anthony |last=Cains |chapter=The surface examination of skin: a binder's note on the identification of animal species used in the making of parchment |title=The Book of Kells: proceedings of a conference at Trinity College Dublin, 6–9 September 1992 |editor-first=Felicity |editor-last=O'Mahony |publisher=Scolar Press |place=Aldershot |year=1994 |isbn=0-85967-967-5 |pages=172–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term avoids the need to distinguish between vellum and parchment.&lt;ref name="esdaile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c&amp;g9"/&gt;

Vellum is generally smooth and durable, although there are great variations depending on preparation and the quality of the skin. The manufacture involves the cleaning, bleaching, stretching on a frame (a "herse"), and scraping of the skin with a crescent-shaped knife (a "lunarium" or "lunellum"). To create tension, scraping is alternated with wetting and drying. A final finish may be achieved by abrading the surface with [[pumice]], and treating with a preparation of lime or chalk to make it accept writing or printing ink.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Modern "paper vellum" is a made of synthetic plant material, and is called such for its usage and quality similarities.

In Europe, from Roman times, the term "vellum" was used for the best quality of prepared skin, regardless of the animal from which the hide was obtained, [[calfskin|calf]], [[Sheepskin (material)|sheep]], and [[kidskin|goat]] all being commonly used (other animals, including pig, deer, donkey, horse, or camel have been used). Although the term derives from the French for "calf", animal vellum can include hide from virtually any other mammal. The best quality, "uterine vellum",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Houston|first1=Keith|title=The Book: A Cover-to-Cover Exploration of the Most Powerful Object of Our Time|date=2016|publisher=[[W.W. Norton &amp; Company]]|isbn=978-0-393-24479-3|url=https://blog.longreads.com/2016/12/01/hidebound-the-grisly-invention-of-parchment/|accessdate=2 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202124352/https://blog.longreads.com/2016/12/01/hidebound-the-grisly-invention-of-parchment/|archive-date=2016-12-02|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was said to be made from the skins of [[stillbirth|stillborn]] or unborn animals, although the term was also applied to fine quality skins made from young animals.&lt;ref name="esdaile"/&gt; There has long been, however, much blurring of the boundaries between these terms. In 1519, [[William Horman]] could write in his ''Vulgaria'': "That stouffe that we wrytte upon, and is made of beestis skynnes, is somtyme called parchement, somtyme velem, somtyme abortyve, somtyme membraan."&lt;ref&gt;William Horman, ''Vulgaria'' (1519), fol. 80v; cited in Ustick 1936, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1936, Lee Ustick explained that:
{{quote|To-day the distinction, among collectors of manuscripts, is that ''vellum'' is a highly refined form of skin, ''parchment'' a cruder form, usually thick, harsh, less highly polished than vellum, but with no distinction between skin of calf, or sheep, or of goat.&lt;ref&gt;Ustick 1936, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

French sources, closer to the original etymology, tend to define ''velin'' as from calf only, while the [[British Standards Institution]] defines parchment as made from the split skin of several species, and vellum from the unsplit skin.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Laura, A., ''Bookbinding &amp; conservation by hand: a working guide'', Oak Knoll Press, 1995, {{ISBN|1-884718-11-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-884718-11-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G7tUPQdT2hcC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=sheep+vellum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Op-7E6tE48&amp;sig=jX7CogBbfQLEvoXSj1Xz2R5xCRg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hfyOSvfFFc2hjAfb17n8DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#v=onepage&amp;q=sheep%20vellum&amp;f=false Google books] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118132433/https://books.google.com/books?id=G7tUPQdT2hcC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=sheep+vellum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Op-7E6tE48&amp;sig=jX7CogBbfQLEvoXSj1Xz2R5xCRg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hfyOSvfFFc2hjAfb17n8DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#v=onepage&amp;q=sheep%20vellum&amp;f=false |date=2017-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the usage of modern practitioners of the artistic crafts of writing, illuminating, lettering, and bookbinding, "vellum" is normally reserved for calfskin, while any other skin is called "parchment".&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Johnston|Johnston, E.]] (1906 et seq.) ''Writing, Illuminating, and Lettering''; Lamb, C.M. (ed.)(1956) ''The Calligrapher's Handbook''; and publications of [[Society of Scribes &amp; Illuminators]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture==

Vellum is a translucent material produced from the skin, often split, of a young animal. The skin is washed with water and lime ([[Calcium hydroxide]]), but not together. It is then soaked in lime for several days to soften and remove the hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Once clear, the two sides of the skin are distinct: the side facing inside the animal and the hair side. The "inside body side" of the skin is usually the lighter and more refined of the two. The hair follicles may be visible on the outer side, together with any scarring made while the animal was alive. The membrane can also show the pattern of the animal's vein network called the "veining" of the sheet.&lt;ref name="Codex"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://codexsinaiticus.org/en/project/conservation_physDesc.aspx |title="Recording the physical features of Codex Sinaiticus". ''Codex Sinaiticus'', in partnership with the British Library |access-date=2012-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501201624/http://codexsinaiticus.org/en/project/conservation_physDesc.aspx |archive-date=2012-05-01 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any remaining hair is removed ("scudding") and the skin is dried by attaching it to a frame (a "herse").&lt;ref name="c&amp;g11"&gt;Clemens and Graham 2007, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The skin is attached at points around the circumference with cords; to prevent tearing, the maker wraps the area of the skin to which the cord is to be attached around a pebble (a "pippin").&lt;ref name="c&amp;g11"/&gt; The maker then uses a crescent shaped knife, (a "lunarium" or "lunellum"), to clean off any remaining hairs.

Once the skin is completely dry, it is thoroughly cleaned and processed into sheets. The number of sheets extracted from the piece of skin depends on the size of the skin and the given dimensions requested by the order. For example, the average calfskin can provide three and half medium sheets of writing material. This can be doubled when it is folded into two conjoint leaves, also known as a bifolium. Historians have found evidence of manuscripts where the scribe wrote down the medieval instructions now followed by modern membrane makers.&lt;ref name="daniel"&gt;Thompson, Daniel. "Medieval Parchment-Making". The Library 16, no. 4 (1935).&lt;/ref&gt; The membrane is then rubbed with a round, flat object ("pouncing") to ensure that the ink would adhere well.&lt;ref name="Codex"/&gt;

==Manuscripts==
[[File:Treatises On Natural Science, Philosophy, And Mathematics - Planets.jpg|thumb|right|225px|''A Volume Of Treatises On Natural Science, Philosophy, And Mathematics'' (1300) Ink on vellum.]]

===Preparing manuscripts===
Once the vellum is prepared, traditionally a [[paper quire|quire]] is formed of a group of several sheets. Raymond Clemens and Timothy Graham point out, in their ''Introduction to Manuscript Studies'', that "the quire was the scribe's basic writing unit throughout the Middle Ages".&lt;ref&gt;Clemens and Graham 2007, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Guidelines are then made on the membrane. They note "'pricking' is the process of making holes in a sheet of parchment (or membrane) in preparation of its ruling. The lines were then made by ruling between the prick marks...The process of entering ruled lines on the page to serve as a guide for entering text. Most manuscripts were ruled with horizontal lines that served as the baselines on which the text was entered and with vertical bounding lines that marked the boundaries of the columns".&lt;ref&gt;Clemens and Graham 2007, pp. 15–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
Most of the finer sort of medieval manuscripts, whether [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] or not, were written on vellum. Some [[Gandharan Buddhist texts]] were written on vellum, and all [[Sifrei Torah]] (Hebrew: ספר תורה Sefer Torah; plural: ספרי תורה, Sifrei Torah) are written on [[kosher]] [[klaf]] or vellum.

A quarter of the 180 copy edition of [[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s first [[Gutenberg Bible|Bible]] printed in 1455 with [[movable type]] was also printed on vellum, presumably because his market expected this for a high-quality book. Paper was used for most book-printing, as it was cheaper and easier to process through a [[printing press]] and [[bookbinding|bind]].

In art, vellum was used for paintings, especially if they needed to be sent long distances, before [[canvas]] became widely used in about 1500, and continued to be used for drawings, and [[watercolour]]s. [[Old master print]]s were sometimes printed on vellum, especially for presentation copies, until at least the seventeenth century.

[[Limp vellum]] or limp-parchment bindings were used frequently in the 16th and 17th centuries, and were sometimes [[Gilding|gilt]] but were also often not [[embellishment|embellished]]. In later centuries vellum has been more commonly used like leather, that is, as the covering for stiff board bindings. Vellum can be stained virtually any color but seldom is, as a great part of its beauty and appeal rests in its faint grain and hair markings, as well as its warmth and simplicity.

Lasting in excess of 1,000 years&amp;mdash;[[Gregory the Great, Pastoral Care (Troyes, Bibliothèque Municipale, MS 504)]], for example dates from about 600 and is in excellent condition&amp;mdash;animal vellum can be far more durable than paper. For this reason, many important documents are written on animal vellum, such as diplomas. Referring to a diploma as a "sheepskin" alludes to the time when diplomas were written on vellum made from animal hides.

===Modern usage===
British [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] are still printed on vellum for archival purposes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Goat skin tradition wins the day | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 1999-11-02 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/502342.stm | access-date = 2016-02-11 | quote = Acts of Parliament dating back to 1497 recorded on vellum are currently held in the House of Lords Public Record Office | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409112147/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/502342.stm | archive-date = 2008-04-09 | dead-url = no | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as are those of the [[Republic of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2FFAQ%2Fdocument1.htm | title = Frequently Asked Questions about the Houses of the Oireachtas - Tithe an Oireachtais | website = [[Oireachtas]] | access-date = 2016-02-11 | quote = Once a Bill has been passed by both Houses, the Taoiseach presents a vellum copy of the Bill, prepared in the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas to the President for signature and promulgation as law. | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/671a1xfLj?url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2FFAQ%2Fdocument1.htm | archive-date = 2012-04-18 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2016, the UK [[House of Lords]] announced that legislation would be printed on archive paper instead of the traditional vellum from April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hughes | first = Laura | title = Thousand year old tradition of printing Britain's laws on vellum has been scrapped to save just £80,000 | newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 2016-02-09 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/12149181/Thousand-year-old-tradition-of-printing-Britains-laws-on-vellum-has-been-scrapped-to-save-just-80000.html | access-date = 2016-02-11 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160212064333/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/12149181/Thousand-year-old-tradition-of-printing-Britains-laws-on-vellum-has-been-scrapped-to-save-just-80000.html | archive-date = 2016-02-12 | dead-url = no | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Minister for the Cabinet Office|Cabinet Office Minister]] [[Matthew Hancock]] intervened by agreeing to fund the continued use of vellum from the [[Cabinet Office]] budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hughes | first = Laura | title = Vellum should be saved in a bid to 'safeguard our great traditions', says minister | newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 2016-02-14 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/12149181/Thousand-year-old-tradition-of-printing-Britains-laws-on-vellum-has-been-scrapped-to-save-just-80000.html | access-date = 2016-02-15 | quote = Mr Hancock told The Daily Telegraph: 'Recording our laws on vellum is a millennium long tradition, and surprisingly cost effective.

Today, because of low demand and complicated manufacturing process, animal vellum is expensive and hard to find. The only UK company still producing traditional parchment and vellum is William Cowley (established 1870), which is based in [[Newport Pagnell]], [[Buckinghamshire]]. A modern imitation is made of [[cotton]]. Known as paper vellum, this material is considerably cheaper than animal vellum and can be found in most art and drafting supply stores. Some brands of [[writing paper]] and other sorts of paper use the term "vellum" to suggest quality.

Vellum is still used for Jewish scrolls, of the [[Torah]] in particular, for luxury book-binding, [[memorial book]]s, and for various documents in [[calligraphy]].  It is also used on instruments such as the [[banjo]] and the [[bodhran]], although synthetic skins are also available for these instruments.

==Paper vellum==
Modern imitation vellum is made from plasticized rag cotton or fibers from interior tree bark. Terms include: paper vellum, Japanese vellum, and vegetable vellum.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Paper vellum is usually translucent and its various [[Paper size|sizes]] are often used in applications where tracing is required, such as [[architectural plan]]s.  It is more dimensionally stable than a linen or paper sheet, which is frequently critical in the development of large scaled drawings such as [[blueprint]]s. Paper vellum had also become extremely important in hand or chemical reproduction technology for dissemination of plan copies. Like a high-quality traditional vellum, paper vellum could be produced thin enough to be virtually [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] to strong light, enabling a source drawing to be used directly in the reproduction of field-used drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Drafting, 60-61; Yee, Rendow, ''Architectural Drawing: A Visual Compendium of Types and Methods'', 4th edition, 2012, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|1118310446}}, 781118310441, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hphgl8Tu1HEC&amp;pg=PT1532 google]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
{{refimprove|date=August 2014}}
Vellum is ideally stored in a stable environment with constant temperature and 30%&amp;nbsp;(±&amp;nbsp;5%) [[relative humidity]]. If vellum is stored in an environment with less than 11% relative humidity, it becomes fragile, brittle, and susceptible to [[mechanical stress]]es; if it is stored in an environment with greater than 40% relative humidity, it becomes vulnerable to gelation and to [[mold]] or [[fungus]] growth.&lt;ref&gt;Eric F. Hansen and Steve N. Lee, "The Effects of Relative Humidity on Some Physical Properties of Modern Vellum: Implications for the Optimum Relative Humidity for the Display and Storage of Parchment", ''The Book and Paper Group Annual'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; The optimal temperature for the preservation of vellum is {{convert|20|+/-|1.5|°C|°F|sigfig=2}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

[[Image:FieldWindbreaks.JPG|right|thumb|Aerial view of field windbreaks in [[North Dakota]]]]
[[Image:Svappavaara 1965a.jpg|right|thumb|One of the original buildings at [[Svappavaara]], designed by [[Ralph Erskine (architect)|Ralph Erskine]], which forms a long windbreak]]

A '''windbreak''' (shelterbelt) is a [[planting]] usually made up of one or more rows of [[tree]]s or [[shrub]]s planted in such a manner as to provide shelter from the [[wind]] and to protect soil from [[erosion]]. They are commonly planted in [[hedge]]rows around the edges of fields on [[farm]]s. If designed properly, windbreaks around a home can reduce the cost of heating and cooling and save [[energy]]. Windbreaks are also planted to help keep [[snow]] from drifting onto roadways or yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Windbreaks|url=https://www.fs.usda.gov/nac/practices/windbreaks.shtml|website=National Agroforestry Center|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers sometimes use windbreaks to keep snow drifts on farm land that will provide water when the snow melts in the spring. Other benefits include contributing to a [[microclimate]] around [[crop]]s (with slightly less [[drying]] and chilling at night), providing [[habitat]] for wildlife&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.blue-berry.pl/index.php/blog/role-of-trees-in-agriculture|title=Role of trees in agriculture|last=User|first=Super|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and, in some regions, providing [[wood]] if the trees are harvested.

Windbreaks and [[intercropping]] can be combined in a farming practice referred to as [[alleycropping]]. Fields are planted in rows of different crops surrounded by rows of trees. These trees provide fruit, wood, or protect the crops from the wind. Alley cropping has been particularly successful in India, Africa, and Brazil, where coffee growers have combined farming and forestry.&lt;ref&gt;Withgott &amp; Brennan 2008, p.249&lt;/ref&gt;

A further use for a shelterbelt is to screen a farm from a main road or motorway. This improves the farm landscape by reducing the visual incursion of the motorway, [[Noise mitigation|mitigating noise]] from the traffic and providing a safe barrier between farm animals and the road.

The term "windbreak" is also used to describe an article of clothing worn to prevent wind chill; this term is favored by Europeans whereas Americans tend to use the term "[[windbreaker]]".

Fences called "windbreaks" are also used. Normally made from [[cotton]], [[nylon]], [[canvas]], and recycled sails, windbreaks tend to have three or more panels held in place with poles that slide into pockets sewn into the panel.  The poles are then hammered into the ground and a windbreak is formed. Windbreaks or "wind fences" are used to reduce wind speeds over erodible areas such as open fields, industrial stockpiles, and dusty industrial operations. As erosion is proportional to wind speed cubed, a reduction of wind speed of 1/2 (for example) will reduce erosion by over 80%.

== Windbreak aerodynamics ==

[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-15117-0005, Infografik, Windschutz, Ertragssteigerung.jpg|thumb|An [[East Germany|East German]] windbreak promotion poster, 1952]]

In essence, when the wind encounters a porous obstacle such as a windbreak or shelterbelt, air pressure increases (loosely speaking, air ''piles up'') on the windward side and (conversely) air pressure decreases on the leeward side. As a result, the airstream approaching the barrier is retarded, and a proportion of it is displaced up and over the barrier, resulting in a ''jet'' of higher wind speed aloft. The remainder of the impinging airstream, having been retarded in its approach, now circulates through the barrier to its downstream edge, pushed along by the decrease in pressure across the shelterbelt's width; emerging on the downwind side, that airstream is now further retarded by an adverse pressure gradient, because in the lee of the barrier, with increasing downwind distance air pressure ''recovers'' again to the ambient level. The result is that minimum wind speed occurs not at or within the windbreak, nor at its downwind edge, but further downwind - nominally, at a distance of about 3 to 5 times the windbreak height ''H''. Beyond that point wind speed recovers, aided by downward momentum transport from the overlying, faster-moving stream. From the perspective of the [[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations]] these effects can be understood as resulting from the loss of momentum caused by the drag of leaves and branches and would be represented by the body force ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (a distributed momentum sink).&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1985; Journal of Wind Engineering &amp; Industrial Aerodynamics, Vol. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only is the mean (average) wind speed reduced in the lee of the shelter, the wind is also less gusty, for turbulent wind fluctuations are also damped. As a result, turbulent vertical mixing is weaker in the lee of the barrier than it is upwind, and interesting secondary microclimatic effects result. For instance, by day sensible heat rising from the ground due to the absorption of sunlight (see ''surface energy budget'') is mixed upward less efficiently in the lee of a windbreak, with the result that air temperature near ground is somewhat higher in the lee than on the windward side. Of course this effect is attenuated with increasing downwind distance and indeed, beyond about 8''H'' downstream a zone may exist that is actually ''cooler'' than upwind.&lt;ref&gt;Argete &amp; Wilson, 1989, Agricultural &amp; Forest Meteorology, Vol 48&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''wing''' is a type of [[fin]] that produces [[Lift (force)|lift]], while moving through air or some other fluid. As such, wings have [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlined]] [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sections]] that are subject to [[aerodynamic force]]s and act as an [[airfoil]]s. A wing's [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] efficiency is expressed as its [[lift-to-drag ratio]]. The lift a wing generates at a given speed and [[angle of attack]] can be one to two [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] greater than the total [[drag (physics)|drag on the wing]]. A high lift-to-drag ratio requires a significantly smaller [[thrust]] to propel the wings through the air at sufficient lift.

Lifting structures used in water, include various [[Foil (fluid mechanics)|foils]], including [[hydrofoil]]s. [[Hydrodynamics]] is the governing science, rather than aerodynamics. Applications of underwater foils occur in [[Hydroplane (boat)|hydroplane]]s, [[sailboat]]s and [[submarine]]s.

==Etymology and usage==
The word "wing" from the Old Norse ''vængr''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=wing|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Etymonline.com|date=|accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; for many centuries referred mainly to the foremost [[limb (anatomy)|limb]]s of [[bird]]s (in addition to the architectural aisle). But in recent centuries the word's meaning has extended to include lift producing appendages of [[insect wing|insect]]s, [[bat]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, [[boomerangs]], [[Wingsail|some sail boats]] and [[aircraft]], or the inverted airfoil on a [[automobile racing|race car]] that generates a [[downforce|downward force]] to increase traction.{{citation needed|date = April 2017}}

==Aerodynamics==

[[File:Aircraft flaps.svg|thumb|right|[[flap (aircraft)|Flaps]] (green) are used in various configurations to increase the wing area and to increase the lift. In conjunction with [[spoiler (aeronautics)|spoilers]] (red), flaps maximize drag and minimize lift during the landing roll.]]
{{Main|Lift (force)}}
The design and analysis of the wings of aircraft is one of the principal applications of the science of [[aerodynamics]], which is a branch of [[fluid mechanics]]. The properties of the airflow around any moving object can – in principle – be found by solving the [[Navier-Stokes equations]] of [[fluid dynamics]]. However, except for simple geometries these equations are notoriously difficult to solve.&lt;ref name=Nasa_NS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/nseqs.html|title=Navier-Stokes Equations|publisher=[[Glenn Research Center|Grc.nasa.gov]]|date=2012-04-16|accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, simpler explanations can be described.

For a wing to produce "lift", it must be oriented at a suitable [[angle of attack]] relative to the flow of air past the wing. When this occurs the wing deflects the airflow downwards, "turning" the air as it passes the wing. Since the wing exerts a force on the air to change its direction, the air must exert a force on the wing, equal in size but opposite in direction. This force manifests itself as differing air pressures at different points on the surface of the wing.&lt;ref name=HR_378a&gt;"...the effect of the wing is to give the air stream a downward velocity component. The reaction force of the deflected air mass must then act on the wing to give it an equal and opposite upward component." In: {{citation|first1=David|last1=Halliday|first2=Robert|last2=Resnick|title=Fundamentals of Physics 3rd Edition|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"If the body is shaped, moved, or inclined in such a way as to produce a net deflection or turning of the flow, the local velocity is changed in magnitude, direction, or both. Changing the velocity creates a net force on the body" {{cite web|publisher=NASA Glenn Research Center|title=Lift from Flow Turning|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/right2.html|accessdate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weltner_Physics_of_Flight_Reviewed"&gt;"The cause of the aerodynamic lifting force is the downward acceleration of air by the airfoil..." {{Citation|last1=Weltner|first1=Klaus|last2=Ingelman-Sundberg|first2=Martin|title=Physics of Flight – reviewed|url=http://user.uni-frankfurt.de/~weltner/Flight/PHYSIC4.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719102847/http://user.uni-frankfurt.de/~weltner/Flight/PHYSIC4.htm|archivedate=2011-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A region of lower-than-normal air pressure is generated over the top surface of the wing, with a higher pressure on the bottom of the wing. (See: [[airfoil]]) These air pressure differences can be either measured directly using instrumentation, or can be calculated from the airspeed distribution using basic [[physics|physical principles]]—including [[Bernoulli's principle]], which relates changes in air speed to changes in air pressure.

The lower air pressure on the top of the wing generates a smaller downward force on the top of the wing than the upward force generated by the higher air pressure on the bottom of the wing. Hence, a net upward force acts on the wing. This force is called the "lift" generated by the wing.

The different velocities of the air passing by the wing, the air pressure differences, the change in direction of the airflow, and the lift on the wing are intrinsically one phenomenon. It is, therefore, possible to calculate lift from any of the other three. For example, the lift can be calculated from the pressure differences, or from different velocities of the air above and below the wing, or from the total momentum change of the deflected air. Fluid dynamics offers other approaches to solving these problems—and all produce the same answers if done correctly. Given a particular wing and its velocity through the air, debates over which mathematical approach is the ''most convenient'' to use can be mistaken by novices as differences of opinion about the basic principles of flight.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/wrong1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross-sectional shape===
An ''airfoil'' ([[American English]]) or ''aerofoil'' ([[British English]]) is the shape of a wing, blade (of a [[Propeller (aeronautics)|propeller]], [[Helicopter rotor|rotor]], or [[turbine]]), or [[sail]] (as seen in [[Multiview orthographic projection#Section|cross-section]]). Wings with an asymmetrical cross section are the norm in [[subsonic flight]]. Wings with a symmetrical cross section can also generate lift by using a positive [[angle of attack]] to deflect air downward. Symmetrical airfoils have higher [[Stall (flight)|stalling]] speeds than [[Camber (aerodynamics)|cambered airfoils]] of the same wing area&lt;ref&gt;E. V. Laitone, Wind tunnel tests of wings at Reynolds numbers below 70 000, ''Experiments in Fluids'' '''23''', ''405'' (1997). {{doi|10.1007/s003480050128}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are used in [[aerobatic]] aircraft{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} as they provide practical performance whether the aircraft is upright or inverted. Another example comes from sailboats, where the sail is a thin membrane with no path-length difference between one side and the other.&lt;ref name=Babinsky&gt;"...consider a sail that is nothing but a vertical wing (generating side-force to propel a yacht). ...it is obvious that the distance between the stagnation point and the trailing edge is more or less the same on both sides. This becomes exactly true in the absence of a mast—and clearly the presence of the mast is of no consequence in the generation of lift. ''Thus, the generation of lift does not require different distances around the upper and lower surfaces.''" Holger Babinsky ''How do Wings Work?'' Physics Education November 2003, [http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9120/38/6/001/pdf/pe3_6_001.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

For flight speeds near the speed of sound ([[transonic flight]]), airfoils with complex asymmetrical shapes are used to minimize the drastic increase in drag associated with airflow near the speed of sound.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Anderson, Jr. ''Introduction to Flight'' 4th ed page 271.&lt;/ref&gt; Such airfoils, called [[supercritical airfoil]]s, are flat on top and curved on the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;'Supercritical wings have a flat-on-top "upside down" look.'

==Design features==
[[File:bmi a319-100 g-dbca closeup arp.jpg|thumb|right|The wing of a landing [[BMI (airline)|BMI]] [[Airbus]] [[A319-100]]. The [[leading edge slats|slats]] at its [[leading edge]] and the [[flap (aircraft)|flap]]s at its [[trailing edge]] are extended.]]
Aircraft wings may feature some of the following:
*A rounded [[leading edge]] cross-section
*A sharp [[trailing edge]] cross-section
*Leading-edge devices such as [[leading edge slats|slats]], [[leading edge slot|slots]], or [[leading edge extension|extension]]s
*Trailing-edge devices such as [[flap (aircraft)|flap]]s or flaperons (combination of flaps and ailerons)
*[[Winglets]] to keep wingtip vortices from increasing drag and decreasing lift
*[[Dihedral (aircraft)|Dihedral]], or a positive wing angle to the horizontal, increases ''spiral stability'' around the roll axis, whereas ''anhedral'', or a negative wing angle to the horizontal, decreases spiral stability.

Aircraft wings may have various devices, such as flaps or slats that the pilot uses to modify the shape and surface area of the wing to change its operating characteristics in flight.
*[[Aileron]]s (usually near the wingtips) to roll the aircraft clockwise or counterclockwise about its long axis
*[[Spoiler (aeronautics)|Spoiler]]s on the upper surface to disrupt the lift and to provide additional traction to an aircraft that has just landed but is still moving.
*[[Vortex generator]]s to help prevent flow separation in transonic flow
*[[Wing fence]]s to keep flow attached to the wing by stopping boundary layer separation from spreading roll direction. 
*[[Folding wing]]s allow more aircraft storage in the confined space of the [[hangar|hangar deck]] of an [[aircraft carrier]]
*[[Variable-sweep wing]] or "swing wings" that allow outstretched wings during low-speed flight (i.e., take-off and landing) and [[swept wing|swept back wing]]s for high-speed flight (including [[supersonic flight]]), such as in the [[F-111 Aardvark]], the [[F-14 Tomcat]], the [[Panavia Tornado]], the [[MiG-23]], the [[MiG-27]], the [[Tu-160]] and the [[B-1B Lancer]] warplanes

==Applications and variants==
Besides [[fixed-wing aircraft]], applications for wing shapes include:{{citation needed|date = April 2017}}
*[[Hang glider]]s, which use wings ranging from fully flexible ([[paraglider]]s, gliding [[parachute]]s), flexible (framed sail wings), to rigid
*[[Kite types|Kites]], which use a variety of lifting surfaces
*[[Free flight (model aircraft)|Flying model airplane]]s
*[[Helicopter]]s, which use a rotating wing with a variable pitch angle to provide directional forces
*[[Propeller]]s, whose blades generate lift for propulsion.
*The [[NASA]] [[Space Shuttle]], which uses its wings only to glide during its descent to a runway. These types of aircraft are called [[spaceplane]]s.
*Some [[racing cars]], especially [[Formula One car]]s, which use upside-down wings (or ''[[airfoil]]s'') to provide greater traction at high speeds
*[[Sailboat]]s, which use sails as vertical wings with variable fullness and direction to move across water

===In nature===
In nature, wings have [[evolution|evolved]] in insects, [[pterosaurs]], dinosaurs ([[bird]]s), and mammals ([[bats]]) as a means of [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]]. Various species of [[penguin]]s and other flighted or [[flightless bird|flightless]] water birds such as [[auk]]s, [[cormorant]]s, [[guillemot]]s, [[shearwater]]s, [[eider duck|eider]] and scoter ducks and diving [[petrels]] are avid swimmers, and use their wings to propel through water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Swimming.html|title=Swimming|publisher=Stanford.edu|date=|accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tensile structures===
In 1948, [[Francis Rogallo]] invented a kite-like [[Rogallo wing|tensile wing]] supported by inflated or rigid struts, which ushered in new possibilities for aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4308/ch11.htm#382 |title=Rogallo Wing -the story told by NASA |publisher=History.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near in time, [[Domina Jalbert]] invented flexible un-sparred ram-air airfoiled thick wings. These two new branches of wings have been since extensively studied and applied in new branches of aircraft, especially altering the personal recreational aviation landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=56MSopnqjycC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=Domina+Jalbert+ram+air+wing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjSgKCInafcAhXPV98KHTsxCCsQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Domina%20Jalbert%20ram%20air%20wing&amp;f=false|title=The Golden Knights: The U.S. Army Parachute Team|last=Hopkins|first=Ellen|last2=Bledsoe|first2=Glen|date=2001|publisher=Capstone|year=|isbn=9780736807753|location=|pages=21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
