'''''A History of God''''' is a book by [[Karen Armstrong]]. It details the history of the three major [[monotheistic]] traditions, [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], along with [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. The evolution of the idea of [[God]] is traced from its ancient roots in the [[Middle East]] up to the present day.

==Summary==

===Judaism===
Armstrong begins with the rise of the [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] of [[Yahweh]] (Jahweh), one of the deities of [[Canaan]]. According to Armstrong, the cult of Yahweh consisted of a variety of ethnic groups that migrated to [[Canaan]] in three waves. These groups were united by their loyalty to Yahweh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Karen|title=A History of God|year=1993|publisher=Ballatine Books|isbn=0-345-38456-3|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yahweh was unique in the ancient Middle East in that he actually participated in the [[wikt:profane|profane]] lives of his worshipers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Karen|title=A History of God|year=1993|publisher=Ballatine Books|isbn=0-345-38456-3|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She then examines the sources of the [[Pentateuch]] by way of the four supposed authors, or groups of authors, known as [[Documentary hypothesis|''J'', ''E'', ''P'' and ''D'']]. Moreover, she explores some of the textual tensions that exist in the [[Pentateuch]] as a result of the theological tensions between these authors, or groups of authors. For Armstrong, this tension can be seen in, for example, the contrasting accounts of [[theophany|theophanies]]. The [[Jahwist]] (J) writes of very "intimate" encounters between Abraham and Yahweh, while the [[Elohist]] (E) "prefers to distance the event and make the old legends less [[anthropomorphic]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Karen|title=A History of God|year=1993|publisher=Ballatine Books|isbn=0-345-38456-3|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There follows an examination of the major [[Israelite]] [[prophet]]s, including [[Isaiah]], second Isaiah, [[Hosea]] and [[Ezekiel]], and the contribution each made to the [[Jewish]] conception of [[God]].

===Christianity===
Armstrong then turns to the stories attributed to the life of [[Jesus]]. She identifies his roots in the [[Pharisees|Pharisaic]] tradition of [[Hillel the Elder]] and his effect on the Jewish conception of a god. The death of Jesus and its attendant symbolism are examined, including the various constructions others, most notably [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], have placed upon these events. 

The book explores the rise of trinitarianism, leading to the [[Nicene Creed]], and traces the evolution of the Christian conception of God and the [[Trinity]] in the respective [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] and [[Western Christianity|Western]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Logic and Reason&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
The rise of [[Islam]] and its appreciation of the nature of God are examined.  Armstrong analyzes how modern [[Shia Islam]], with its emphasis upon social action in the service of [[Allah]], the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], and the [[Shia Imams]], was a key factor that brought about the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979.

Subsequent chapters examine respectively both philosophical approaches to the idea of God, and the mystical relationship with God. 

Armstrong discusses the rise of modern Christian religiosity, in particular the [[Protestantism]] of [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]].

===Conclusion===
The final chapters examine the notion of the ''[[Death of God]]'' and the idea of God in a [[postmodernity|post-modern]] world.

[[Image:Banksia menziesii 1 gnangarra.jpg|thumb|right|The sequential anthesis of the individual flowers in this ''[[Banksia menziesii]]'' inflorescence has begun.]]
'''Anthesis''' is the period during which a [[flower]] is fully open and functional. It may also refer to the onset of that period.

The onset of anthesis is spectacular in some species. In ''[[Banksia]]'' species, for example, anthesis involves the extension of the [[carpel|style]] far beyond the upper [[perianth]] parts. Anthesis of flowers is sequential within an [[inflorescence]], so when the style and perianth are different colours, the result is a striking colour change that gradually sweeps along the inflorescence.

Flowers with [[diurnality|diurnal]] anthesis generally are brightly colored in order to attract diurnal insects, such as butterflies.
Flowers with [[nocturnal]] anthesis generally are white or less colorful, and as such, they contrast more strongly with the night. These flowers typically attract nocturnal insects including many moth species.

'''Attainable region (AR) theory''' is a branch of [[chemical engineering]], specifically [[chemical reaction engineering]], that uses geometric and mathematical optimization concepts to assist in the design of networks of chemical reactors. AR theory is a method to help define the best reactor flowsheet using graphical techniques for a desired duty or objective function.&lt;ref name="UNISA Online"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reactor Systems Design (Attainable Regions)|url=http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&amp;ContentID=97610|website=UNISA|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fogler &amp; Gurmen © 2008 University of Michigan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Attainable Region Theory – University of Michigan|url=http://www.umich.edu/~elements/arpages/intro/intro.htm|website=University of Michigan|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of AR theory ==
The initial concept of an attainable region for chemical processes was proposed by Fritz Horn in 1964, where he believed in geometric methods to improve process design.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feinberg|first=Martin|date=2002|title=Toward a theory of process synthesis|url=|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas were later refined and made specific to chemical reactors by co-developers David Glasser, Diane Hildebrandt,&lt;ref name="Amazon.com"&gt;{{cite book|title=Attainable Region Theory: An Introduction to Choosing an Optimal Reactor|isbn=978-1119157885|last1=Ming|first1=David|last2=Glasser|first2=David|last3=Metgzer|first3=Matthew|last4=Hildebrandt|first4=Diane|last5=Glasser|first5=Benjamin|date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Martin Feinberg.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Overview ==
The AR is defined as the collection all possible outcomes for all conceivable reactor combinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Metzger|first=Matthew|last2=Glasser|first2=Benjamin|last3=Glasser|first3=David|last4=Hausberger|first4=Brendon|last5=Hildebrandt|first5=Diane|date=2007|title=Teaching Reaction Engineering Using the Attainable Region|url=http://coewww.rutgers.edu/bglasser/ResearchGroup/Publications/CEE07.pdf|journal=Chemical Engineering Education|page=258|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geometrically, the AR may (for instance) be represented as a convex region in state space representing all possible outlet compositions for all reactor combinations. A combination of reactors is often termed a reactor structure. An example of the reactors that are considered for this theory are [[Continuous stirred-tank reactor|Continuous flow stirred-tank reactor (CSTR)]] and a [[Plug flow reactor model|Plug flow reactor model (PFR)]].

Knowledge of the AR helps to address two areas in chemical reactor design:
# The reactor network synthesis problem: Given a system of reactions and feed point, construction of the AR assists with determining an optimal reactor structure that achieves a desired duty or objective function. That is, AR theory assists with understanding specifically what type and combination of the chemical reactors are best suited for a particular system and duty. 
# Performance targeting: Given an existing reactor design, knowledge of the AR assists with understanding if there are other reactor structures that could achieve superior performance, by comparison to its location in the AR. Seeing as the AR represents all reactor designs by definition, different proposed reactor designs must lie as a point in or on the AR in state space. The effectiveness of each design may then all be assessed by comparison the AR and their relation to objective functions if any.

== Applications of theory ==
Examples of where AR theory can be applied, include:
* The design of [[batch reactor]] networks;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ming|first=David et al.|date=2013|title=Application of attainable region theory to batch reactors|url=|journal=Chemical Engineering Science|doi=10.1016/j.ces.2013.06.001|pmid=|access-date=|volume=99|pages=203–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; and

'''Audio system measurements''' are made for several purposes. Designers take measurements so that they can specify the performance of a piece of equipment. Maintenance engineers make them to ensure equipment is still working to specification, or to ensure that the cumulative defects of an audio path are within limits considered acceptable. Some aspects of measurement and specification relate only to intended usage. Audio system measurements often accommodate [[psychoacoustic]] principles to measure the system in a way that relates to human hearing.

== Subjectivity and frequency weighting ==
Subjectively valid methods came to prominence in consumer audio in the UK and Europe in the 1970s, when the introduction of [[compact cassette]] tape, [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx]] and [[Dolby noise reduction]] techniques revealed the unsatisfactory nature of many basic engineering measurements. The specification of [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting|weighted CCIR-468 quasi-peak noise]], and [[flutter measurement|weighted quasi-peak wow and flutter]] became particularly widely used and attempts were made to find more valid methods for distortion measurement.

Measurements based on psychoacoustics, such as the measurement of [[noise (physics)|noise]], often use a [[weighting filter]]. It is well established that [[human hearing]] is more sensitive to some frequencies than others, as demonstrated by [[equal-loudness contours]], but it is not well appreciated that these contours vary depending on the type of sound. The measured curves for pure tones, for instance, are different from those for random noise. The ear also responds less well to short bursts, below 100 to 200 ms, than to continuous sounds&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Brian C. J., ''An Introduction to the Psychology of Hearing'', 2004, 5th ed. p137, Elsevier Press&lt;/ref&gt; such that a [[quasi-peak detector]] has been found to give the most representative results when noise contains click or bursts, as is often the case for noise in digital systems.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Research Report EL17, ''The Assessment of Noise in Audio Frequency Circuits'', 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, a set of subjectively valid measurement techniques have been devised and incorporated into BS, [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]], [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]] and [[ITU]] standards. These methods of [[audio quality measurement]] are used by broadcast engineers throughout most of the world, as well as by some audio professionals, though the older [[A-weighting]] standard for continuous tones is still commonly used by others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sweetwater.com/expert-center/glossary/t--ANSIA-Weighting Expert center glossary]{{Failed verification|date=January 2011}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320214941/http://www.sweetwater.com/expert-center/glossary/t--ANSIA-Weighting |date=20 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No single measurement can assess audio quality. Instead, engineers use a series of measurements to analyze various types of degradation that can reduce fidelity. Thus, when testing an analogue tape machine it is necessary to [[wow and flutter measurement|test for wow and flutter]] and tape speed variations over longer periods, as well as for distortion and noise. When testing a digital system, testing for speed variations is normally considered unnecessary because of the accuracy of clocks in digital circuitry, but testing for [[aliasing]] and timing [[jitter]] is often desirable, as these have caused audible degradation in many systems.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Once subjectively valid methods have been shown to correlate well with listening tests over a wide range of conditions, then such methods are generally adopted as preferred. Standard engineering methods are not always sufficient when comparing like with like. One CD player, for example, might have higher measured  noise than another CD player when measured with a RMS method, or even an A-weighted RMS method, yet sound quieter and measure lower when 468-weighting is used. This could be because it has more noise at high frequencies, or even at frequencies beyond 20&amp;nbsp;kHz, both of which are less important since human ears are less sensitive to them. (See [[noise shaping]].) This effect is how [[Dolby noise-reduction system#Dolby B|Dolby B]] works and why it was introduced. Cassette noise, which was predominately high frequency and unavoidable given the small size and speed of the recorded track could be made subjectively much less important. The noise sounded 10&amp;nbsp;dB quieter, but failed to measure much better unless 468-weighting was used rather than A-weighting.

== Measurable performance ==

=== Analog electrical ===
; [[Frequency response]] (FR) : This measurement tells you over what frequency range output level for an audio component will remain reasonably constant (either within a specified [[decibel]] range, or no more than a certain number of [[Decibel|dB]] from the amplitude at 1k[[Hertz|Hz]]). Some audio components such as tone controls are designed to adjust the loudness of signal content at particular frequencies, e.g., a [[bass (music)|bass]] control allows the attenuation or accentuation of low frequency signal content, in which case the specification may specify the frequency response is taken with tone controls "flat" or disabled. [[Preamplifiers]] may also contain [[equalization (audio)|equalizer]]s, [[filter (signal processing)|filter]]s for example to play [[LP album|LP]]s requiring [[RIAA]] frequency response correction, in which case the specification may describe how closely the response matches the standard.  By comparison, [[Frequency range]] is a term sometimes used of [[loudspeakers]] and other [[transducers]] to indicate the frequencies that are usable, without normally specifying a decibel range.  [[Power bandwidth]] is also related to frequency response - indicating the range of frequencies usable at high power (since frequency response measurements are normally taken at low signal levels, where [[slew rate]] limitations or [[transformer]] saturation would not be a problem.

: A component having a 'flat' frequency response will not change the weighting (i.e., intensity) of signal content across the specified frequency range. The frequency range often specified for audio components is between 20 [[Hertz|Hz]] to 20 kHz, which broadly reflects the human hearing range (the highest audible frequency for most people is less than 20 kHz, with 16 kHz being more typical &lt;ref&gt;Ashihara, Kaoru, [http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=JASMAN00012200000300EL52000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes "Hearing thresholds for pure tones above 16  kHz"], ''J. Acoust. Soc. Am.'' Volume 122, Issue 3, pp. EL52-EL57 (September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;). Components with 'flat' frequency responses are often described as being linear. Most audio components are designed to be linear across their entire operating range. Well-designed solid-state amplifiers and CD players may have a frequency response that varies by only 0.2 dB between 20 Hz to 20 kHz.&lt;ref&gt;Metzler, Bob, [http://ap.com/download/books "Audio Measurement Handbook"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621184958/http://ap.com/download/books |date=21 June 2009 }}, Second edition for PDF. Page 86 and 138. Audio Precision, USA. Retrieved 9 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Loudspeakers tend to have a considerably less flat frequency responses than this.

; [[Total harmonic distortion]] (THD) : Music material contains distinct tones, and some kinds of distortion involve spurious tones at double or triple the frequencies of those tones. Such harmonically related distortion is called harmonic distortion. For [[high fidelity]], this is usually expected to be &lt; 1% for electronic devices; mechanical elements such as loudspeakers usually have inescapable higher levels. Low distortion is relatively easy to achieve in electronics with use of [[negative feedback]], but the use of high levels of feedback in this manner has been the topic of much controversy among [[audiophile]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Essentially all loudspeakers produce more distortion than electronics, and 1–5% distortion is not unheard of at moderately loud listening levels. Human ears are less sensitive to distortion in the low frequencies, and levels are usually expected to be under 10% at loud playback. Distortion that creates only even-order harmonics for a sine wave input is sometimes considered less bothersome than odd-order distortion.

; [[Audio power|Output power]]
: Output power for amplifiers is ideally measured and quoted as maximum Root Mean Square ([[root mean square|RMS]]) [[power (physics)|power]] output per channel, at a specified distortion level at a particular load, which, by convention and government regulation, is considered the most meaningful measure of power available on music signals, though real, non-[[clipping (audio)|clipping]] music has a high [[peak-to-average ratio]], and usually averages well below the maximum possible. The commonly given measurement of PMPO (peak music power out) is largely meaningless and often used in marketing literature; in the late 1960s there was much controversy over this point and the US Government (FTA) required that RMS figures be quoted for all high fidelity equipment. Music power has been making a comeback in recent years. ''See also [[Audio power]].''
: Power specifications require the [[load impedance]] to be specified, and in some cases two figures will be given (for instance, the output power of a power amplifier for loudspeakers will be typically measured at 4 and 8 [[ohm]]s). To deliver maximum power to the load, the impedance of the driver should be the complex conjugate of the impedance of the load. In the case of a purely resistive load, the resistance of the driver should be equal to the resistance of the load to achieve maximum output power. This is referred to as [[impedance matching]].

; [[Intermodulation distortion]] (IMD) : Distortion that is not harmonically related to the signal being amplified is intermodulation distortion. It is a measure of the level of spurious signals resulting from unwanted combination of different frequency input signals. This effect results from non-linearities in the system. Sufficiently high levels of negative feedback can reduce this effect in an amplifier. Many believe it is better to design electronics in a way to minimize feedback levels, though this is difficult to achieve while meeting other high accuracy requirements. Intermodulation in loudspeaker drivers is, as with harmonic distortion, almost always larger than in most electronics. IMD increases with cone excursion. Reducing a driver's bandwidth directly reduces IMD. This is achieved by splitting the desired frequency range into separate bands and employing separate drivers for each band of frequencies, and feeding them through a [[Audio crossover|crossover filter network]]. Steep slope crossover filters are most effective at IMD reduction, but may be too expensive to implement using high-current components and may introduce ringing distortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xsgeo.com/course/filt.htm Excess Geophysics. ''FREQUENCY FILTERING in practice'']&lt;/ref&gt; Intermodulation distortion in multi-driver loudspeakers can be greatly reduced with the use of [[active crossover]], though it significantly increases system cost and complexity.

; [[Noise (physics)|Noise]] : The level of unwanted noise generated by the system itself, or by interference from external sources added to the signal. '''[[Hum (sound)|Hum]]''' usually refers to noise only at power line frequencies (as opposed to broadband [[white noise]]), which is introduced through induction of power line signals into the inputs of gain stages. Or from inadequately regulated power supplies.

; [[Crosstalk]] : The introduction of noise (from another signal channel) caused by ground currents, stray inductance or capacitance between components or lines. Crosstalk reduces, sometimes noticeably, separation between channels (e.g., in a stereo system). A [[crosstalk measurement]] yields a figure in dB relative to a nominal level of signal in the path receiving interference. Crosstalk is normally only a problem in equipment that processes multiple audio channels in the same chassis.

; [[Common-mode rejection ratio]] (CMRR) : In [[balanced audio]] systems, there are equal and opposite signals (difference-mode) in inputs, and any interference imposed on both leads will be subtracted, canceling out that interference (i.e., the common-mode). CMRR is a measure of a system's ability to ignore such interference, and especially hum at its input. It is generally only significant with long lines on an input, or when some kinds of [[ground loop (electricity)|ground loop]] problems exist. Unbalanced inputs do not have common mode resistance; induced noise on their inputs appears directly as noise or hum.

; [[Dynamic range]] ''and'' [[Signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) : The difference between the maximum level a component can accommodate and the noise level it produces. Input noise is not counted in this measurement. It is measured in dB.
: ''Dynamic range'' refers to the ratio of maximum to minimum loudness in a given signal source (e.g., music or programme material), and this measurement also quantifies the maximum dynamic range an audio system can carry. This is the ratio (usually expressed in [[decibel|dB]]) between the noise floor of the device with no signal and the maximum signal (usually a [[sine wave]]) that can be output at a specified (low) distortion level.
:Since the early 1990s it has been recommended by several authorities including the [[Audio Engineering Society]] that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present. This avoids questionable measurements based on the use of blank media, or muting circuits.

: ''Signal-to-noise ratio'' (SNR), however, is the ratio between the noise floor and an arbitrary reference level or [[alignment level]]. In "professional" recording equipment, this reference level is usually +4 dBu (IEC 60268-17), though sometimes 0 dBu (UK and Europe - EBU standard Alignment level). 'Test level', 'measurement level' and 'line-up level' mean different things, often leading to confusion. In "consumer" equipment, no standard exists, though −10 dBV and −6 dBu are common.
: Different media characteristically exhibit different amounts of [[noise measurement|noise]] and [[Headroom (audio signal processing)|headroom]]. Though the values vary widely between units, a typical analogue [[compact cassette|cassette]] might give 60 [[decibel|dB]], a [[Compact disc|CD]] almost 100 dB. Most modern quality amplifiers have &gt;110 dB dynamic range,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.zainea.com/Dynamic%20range.htm|title = Dynamic-Range Issues in the Modern Digital Audio Environment|last = FIELDER|first = LOUIS D.|date = May 1, 1995|website = zainea.com|publisher = Dolby Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA 91403, USA|access-date = 7 March 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160626055428/http://www.zainea.com/Dynamic%20range.htm|archive-date = 26 June 2016|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which approaches that of the human [[ear]], usually taken as around 130 dB. See [[Programme levels]].

; [[Phase distortion]]'', ''[[Group delay]]'', and ''[[Phase delay]] : A perfect audio component will maintain the [[phase (waves)|phase]] coherency of a signal over the full range of frequencies. Phase distortion can be extremely difficult to reduce or eliminate. The human ear is largely insensitive to phase distortion, though it is exquisitely sensitive to relative phase relationships within heard sounds. The complex nature of our sensitivity to phase errors, coupled with the lack of a convenient test that delivers an easily understood quality rating, is the reason that it is not a part of conventional audio specifications.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Multi-driver loudspeaker systems may have complex phase distortions, caused or corrected by crossovers, driver placement, and the phase behaviour of the specific driver.

; [[Transient response]] : A system may have low distortion for a steady-state signal, but not on sudden transients. In amplifiers, this problem can be traced to power supplies in some instances, to insufficient high frequency performance or to excessive negative feedback. Related measurements are [[slew rate]] and [[rise time]]. Distortion in transient response can be hard to measure. Many otherwise good power amplifier designs have been found to have inadequate slew rates, by modern standards. In loudspeakers, transient response performance is affected by the mass and resonances of drivers and enclosures and by [[group delay and phase delay]] introduced by crossover filtering or inadequate time alignment of the loudspeaker's drivers. Most [[loudspeaker]]s generate significant amounts of transient distortion, though some designs are less prone to this (e.g. [[electrostatic loudspeaker]]s, [[plasma arc loudspeaker|plasma arc tweeters]], [[Tweeter#Ribbon tweeter|ribbon tweeter]]s and [[Loudspeaker enclosure#Multiple entry horn|horn enclosures with multiple entry points]]).

; [[Damping factor]] : A higher number is generally believed to be better. This is a measure of how well a power [[amplifier]] controls the undesired motion of a [[loudspeaker]] driver. An amplifier must be able to suppress [[resonance]]s caused by mechanical motion (e.g., [[inertia]]) of a speaker cone, especially a low frequency driver with greater mass. For conventional loudspeaker drivers, this essentially involves ensuring that the [[output impedance]] of the amplifier is close to zero and that the speaker wires are sufficiently short and have sufficiently large diameter. Damping factor is the ratio of the output impedance of an amplifier and connecting cables to the DC resistance of a [[voice coil]], which means that long, high resistance speaker wires will reduce the damping factor. A damping factor of 20 or greater is considered adequate for live [[sound reinforcement system]]s, as the SPL of inertia-related driver movement is 26&amp;nbsp;dB less than signal level and won't be heard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prosoundweb.com/article//what_is_loudspeaker_damping_damping_factor_df/ ProSoundWeb. Chuck McGregor, Community Professional Loudspeakers. September 1999. ''What is Loudspeaker Damping and Damping Factor (DF)?'']&lt;/ref&gt; Negative feedback in an amplifier lowers its effective output impedance and thus increases its damping factor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aikenamps.com/NegativeFeedback.htm Aiken Amplification. Randall Aiken. ''What is Negative Feedback?'' 1999] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016103114/http://www.aikenamps.com/NegativeFeedback.htm |date=16 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanical ===
; [[Wow (recording)|Wow]] and [[Flutter (electronics and communication)|flutter]] : These measurements are related to physical motion in a component, largely the drive mechanism of [[analog signal|analogue]] media, such as [[vinyl record]]s and [[magnetic tape]]. "Wow" is slow speed (a few Hz) variation, caused by longer term drift of the drive motor speed, whereas "flutter" is faster speed (a few tens of Hz) variations, usually caused by mechanical defects such as out-of-roundness of the [[capstan (tape recorder)|capstan]] of a tape transport mechanism. The measurement is given in % and a lower number is better.

; Rumble : The measure of the low frequency (many tens of Hz) noise contributed by the [[phonograph|turntable]] of an analogue playback system. It is caused by imperfect bearings, uneven motor windings, vibrations in driving bands in some turntables, room vibrations (e.g., from traffic) that is transmitted by the turntable mounting and so to the phono cartridge. A lower number is better.

=== Digital ===

Note that digital systems do not suffer from many of these effects at a signal level, though the same processes occur in the circuitry, since the data being handled is ''symbolic''. As long as the symbol survives the transfer between components, and can be perfectly regenerated (e.g., by [[pulse shaping]] techniques) the data itself is perfectly maintained. The data is typically buffered in a memory, and is [[Clock signal|clocked]] out by a very precise [[crystal oscillator]]. The data usually does not degenerate as it passes through many stages, because each stage regenerates new symbols for transmission.

Digital systems have their own problems. Digitizing adds [[quantization noise|noise]], which is measurable and depends on the [[audio bit depth]] of the system, regardless of other quality issues. Timing errors in sampling clocks ([[jitter]]) result in non-linear distortion (FM modulation) of the signal. One quality measurement for a digital system (Bit Error Rate) relates to the probability of an error in transmission or reception. Other metrics on the quality of the system are defined by the [[sample rate]] and [[Audio bit depth|bit depth]]. In general, digital systems are much less prone to error than analog systems; However, nearly all digital systems have analog inputs and/or outputs, and certainly all of those that interact with the analog world do so. These analog components of the digital system can suffer analog effects and potentially compromise the integrity of a well designed digital system.

; [[Jitter]] : A measurement of the variation in period (periodic jitter) and absolute timing (random jitter) between measured clock timing versus an ideal clock. Less jitter is generally better for sampling systems.

; [[Sample rate]] : A specification of the rate at which measurements are taken of the analog signal. This is measured in samples per second, or [[hertz]]. A higher sampling rate allows a greater total bandwidth or pass-band frequency response and allows less-steep anti-aliasing/anti-imaging filters to be used in the stop-band, which can in turn improve overall phase linearity in the pass-band.

; [[Audio bit depth|Bit depth]] : In [[Pulse-code modulation]] audio, the bit depth is the number of [[bit]]s of information in each [[Sampling (signal processing)|sample]]. [[Quantization (signal processing)|Quantization]], a process used in digital audio sampling, creates an error in the [[Signal reconstruction|reconstructed signal]]. The [[Signal-to-quantization-noise ratio]] is a multiple of the bit depth.

:[[Compact Disc Digital Audio|Audio CDs]] use a bit depth of 16-bits, while [[DVD-Video]] and [[Blu-ray]] discs can use 24-bit audio. The maximum [[dynamic range]] of a 16-bit system is about 96dB,&lt;ref name="Middleton, Zak"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dUw8oha56zwC&amp;pg=PA54 |page=54 |last1=Middleton |first1=Chris |last2=Zuk |first2=Allen |title=The Complete Guide to Digital Audio: A Comprehensive Introduction to Digital Sound and Music-Making |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2003 |isbn=978-1592001026 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while for 24 bit it is about 144 dB.

:[[Dither]] can be used in [[audio mastering]] to randomize the [[quantization error]], and some dither systems use [[Noise shaping]] to spectral shape of the quantization noise floor. The use of shaped dither can increase the effective dynamic range of 16-bit audio to around 120&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;http://xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html “With use of shaped dither ... the effective dynamic range of 16 bit audio reaches 120dB in practice”&lt;/ref&gt;

:To calculate the maximum theoretical dynamic range of a digital system ([[Signal-to-quantization-noise ratio]] (SQNR)) use the following algorithm for bit depth Q:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SQNR} = 20 \log_{10}(2^Q) \approx 6.02 \cdot Q\ \mathrm{dB} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:Example: A [[16-bit]] system has 2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; different possibilities, from 0 – 65,535. The smallest signal without dithering is 1, so the number of different levels is one less, 2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; - 1. 
:So for a 16-bit digital system, the Dynamic Range is 20·log(2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; - 1) ≈ 96 dB.

; Sample accuracy/synchronization : Not as much a specification as an ability. Since independent digital audio devices are each run by their own [[crystal oscillator]], and no two crystals are exactly the same, the sample rate will be slightly different. This will cause the devices to drift apart over time. The effects of this can vary. If one digital device is used to monitor another digital device, this will cause dropouts or distortion in the audio, as one device will be producing more or less data than the other per unit time. If two independent devices record at the same time, one will lag the other more and more over time. This effect can be circumvented with a [[wordclock]] synchronization.  It can also be corrected in the digital domain using a drift correction algorithm.  Such an algorithm compares the relative rates of two or more devices and drops or adds samples from the streams of any devices that drift too far from the master device.  Sample rate will also vary slightly over time, as crystals change in temperature, etc.  See also [[clock recovery]]

; Linearity : ''Differential non-linearity'' and ''integral non-linearity'' are two measurements of the accuracy of an [[analog-to-digital converter]]. Basically, they measure how close the threshold levels for each bit are to the theoretical equally-spaced levels.

==Automated sequence testing==
Sequence testing uses a specific sequence of test signals, for frequency response, noise, distortion etc., generated and measured automatically to carry out a complete quality check on a piece of equipment or signal path. A single 32-second sequence was standardized by the [[EBU]] in 1985, incorporating 13 tones (40&amp;nbsp;Hz–15&amp;nbsp;kHz at −12&amp;nbsp;dB) for frequency response measurement, two tones for distortion (1024&amp;nbsp;Hz/60&amp;nbsp;Hz at +9&amp;nbsp;dB) plus crosstalk and compander tests. This sequence, which began with a 110-[[baud]] [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]] signal for synchronizing purposes, also became [[CCITT]] standard O.33 in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ITU-T Recommendation|title=Specifications for Measuring Equipment - Automatic Equipment for Rapidly Measuring Stereophonic Pairs and Monophonic Sound-Programme Circuits, Links and Connections|url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-O.33-199507-I/en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lindos Electronics]] expanded the concept, retaining the FSK concept, and inventing segmented sequence testing, which separated each test into a 'segment' starting with an identifying character transmitted as 110-baud FSK so that these could be regarded as 'building blocks' for a complete test suited to a particular situation. Regardless of the mix chosen, the FSK provides both identification and synchronization for each segment, so that sequence tests sent over networks and even satellite links are automatically responded to by measuring equipment. Thus TUND represents a sequence made up of four segments which test the [[alignment level]], [[frequency response]], [[noise measurement|noise]] and [[distortion measurement|distortion]] in less than a minute, with many other tests, such as [[Wow and flutter measurement|Wow and flutter]], [[Headroom (audio signal processing)|Headroom]], and [[Crosstalk measurement|Crosstalk]] also available in segments as well as a whole.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

The Lindos sequence test system is now a 'de facto' standard {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}in broadcasting and many other areas of audio testing, with over 25 different segments recognized by Lindos test sets, and the EBU standard is no longer used.

== Unquantifiable? ==
Many audio components are tested for performance using objective and quantifiable measurements, e.g., THD, dynamic range and frequency response. Some take the view that objective measurements are useful and often relate well to subjective performance, i.e., the sound quality as experienced by the listener.&lt;ref&gt;Aczel, Peter, [http://www.theaudiocritic.com/back_issues/The_Audio_Critic_29_r.pdf "Audio Critic"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928214133/http://www.theaudiocritic.com/back_issues/The_Audio_Critic_29_r.pdf |date=28 September 2007 }}, ''Issue No. 29'', ''Our Last Hip-Boots Column'', page 5-6, Summer 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Floyd Toole has extensively [[Loudspeaker acoustics|evaluated loudspeakers]] in [[acoustical engineering]] research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.torontoaes.org/Seminar2008/bios/guests/Floyd_Toole.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cirmmt.org/activities/distinguished-lectures/toole&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[peer reviewed]] [[scientific journal]], Toole has presented findings that subjects have a range of abilities to distinguish good loudspeakers from bad, and that [[blind experiment|blind]] listening tests are more reliable than sighted tests. He found that subjects can more accurately perceive differences in speaker quality during [[monaural]] playback though a single loudspeaker, whereas subjective perception of [[stereophonic sound]] is more influenced by room effects.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20160717035403/http://www.almainternational.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Pt_1_ASA_Providence_2014_with_notes_6-14.154134559.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; One of Toole's papers showed that objective measurements of loudspeaker performance match subjective evaluations in listening tests.&lt;ref&gt;Toole, Floyd, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030403060501/http://www.harman.com/wp/pdf/AudioScience.pdf "Audio – Science in the Service of Art"], Harman International Industries Inc., 24 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that because human hearing and perception are not fully understood, listener experience should be valued above everything else. This tactic is often encountered in the [[High-end audio|high-end]] [[home audio]] world, where it is used to sell amplifiers with poor specifications. The usefulness of blind listening tests and common objective performance measurements, e.g., THD, are questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Harley, Robert, [http://www.stereophile.com/asweseeit/491awsi/ "Were Those Ears So Golden? DCC and PASC"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122034000/http://www.stereophile.com/asweseeit/491awsi/ |date=22 January 2009 }}, ''Stereophile'', ''As We See It'', April 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, crossover distortion at a given THD is much more audible than clipping distortion at the same THD, since the harmonics produced are at higher frequencies.  This does not imply that the defect is somehow unquantifiable or unmeasurable; just that a single THD number is inadequate to specify it and must be interpreted with care.  Taking THD measurements at different output levels would expose whether the distortion is clipping (which increases with level) or crossover (which decreases with level).

Whichever the view, some measurements have been traditionally used, despite having no objective value. For example, THD is an average of a number of harmonics equally weighted, even though research performed decades ago identifies that lower order harmonics are harder to hear at the same level, compared with higher order ones. In addition, even order harmonics are said to be generally harder to hear than odd order. A number of formulas that attempt to correlate THD with actual audibility have been published, however none have gained mainstream use.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The mass market consumer magazine ''[[Stereophile]]'' promotes the claim that home audio enthusiasts prefer sighted tests than blind tests.&lt;ref&gt;Harley, Robert, [http://stereophile.com/asweseeit/182/index2.html "Deeper Meanings"], ''Stereophile'', ''As We See It'', July 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, John, [http://stereophile.com/asweseeit/705awsi/ "Blind Tests &amp; Bus Stops"], ''Stereophile'', ''As We See It'', July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bakeys was founded by Narayana Peesapathy in 2010 in Hyderabad. In April 2016, it earned a crowd-funding of around {{INRconvert|25|l}} from 1500+ backers through Ketto with its initial goal being only {{INRconvert|1|l}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.ketto.org/bakeys|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=| website=Ketto| publisher=|access-date=31 May 2016|title=Eat Your Spoon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this support, the company started a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to increase its reach.&lt;ref name="ZME 2016"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.zmescience.com/ecology/environmental-issues/bakeys-spoon-53749/|last1=Micu|first1=Alexandra|last2=|first2=|date=30 March 2016| website=ZME Science| publisher=|access-date=31 May 2016|title=India’s Bakey edible spoon does two of my favorite things: limits dishes and plastic waste}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1240116767/edible-cutlery-the-future-of-eco-friendly-utensils/description|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=April 2016| website=[[Kickstarter]]| publisher=|access-date=31 May 2016|title=Edible Cutlery: The Future of Eco Friendly Utensils}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, the company had 30 employees.&lt;ref name="TET 2016"/&gt; As of May 2017 the company had not yet started shipping to backers of the Kickstarter, though shipments of the spoons to customers in India, has been proceeding without issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1240116767/edible-cutlery-the-future-of-eco-friendly-utensils/posts/1787901 | date=19 January 2017 | website=Kickstarter | title=Kickstarter Campaign Update}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Kickstarter backers are currently attempting legal action against Bakeys due to no response after pledging over $250,000 in US dollars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2923">'''Baltistics''' is a multidisciplinary study of language and culture (history, literature, folklore, mythology) of the [[Balts|Baltic nations]]. Baltistics by its subject splits into Lithuanistics, Latvistics, Prussistics, etc. Special attention is paid to the language studies, especially to the Baltic protolanguage.
Currently there are about 30 centres of Baltistics, most of them based in Europe, the [[Vilnius University|University of Vilnius]] considered to be the most active centre.

== History ==
[[File:LT-2014-10litų-Baltistika-b.png|thumb|200px|right|A commemorative [[Lithuanian litas]] coin, dedicated to Baltistics, depicts an [[amber]] disk from the [[Neolithic]] era]]

First signs of researching and comparing of the [[Baltic languages]] – [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]] – were seen in the writings of the grammar creators ([[Daniel Klein (grammarian)|Daniel Klein]], ''Grammatica Litvanica'' 1653, [[Gotthard Friedrich Stender]], ''Lettische Grammatik'' 1783). For the first time, scientifically Baltic languages were researched and compared with other [[Indo-European languages]] in the 19th century, when [[Franz Bopp]] in 1816 laid the ground for [[comparative linguistics]]. In his ''Vergleichende Grammatik'', published in 1833, Lithuanian was included. [[Prussian language]] was researched by [[Georg Heinrich Ferdinand Nesselmann]] (''Die Sprache der alten Preussen an ihren Ueberresten erlaeutert'', 1845) and [[Erich Berneker]] (''Die preussische Sprache'', 1896). It was Nesselmann who first suggested the term "Baltic languages".

From 1718 to 1944, a seminar for the study of the Lithuanian language took place in the [[University of Königsberg]].

[[File:Biomagnification.svg|thumb|In biomagnification the concentration of the persistent toxins (crosses) increases higher up the food chain.]]
[[File:Bio-magnification in a pond ecosystem.svg|thumb|In this scenario, a pond has been intoxicated and as we go further into the food chain the toxin concentration increases causing the top consumer to eventually live off intoxication.]]
'''Biomagnification''', also known as '''bioamplification''' or '''biological magnification''', is the increasing concentration of a substance, such as a toxic [[chemical substance|chemical]], in the [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] of tolerant organisms at successively higher levels in a [[food chain]]. This increase can occur as a result of:
* Persistence – where the substance cannot be broken down by environmental processes
* [[Food chain]] [[bioenergetics|energetics]] – where the substance's concentration increases progressively as it moves up a food chain 
* Low or non-existent rate of internal degradation or excretion of the substance – often due to water-insolubility

[[File:The build up of toxins in a food chain.svg|thumb|Biomagnification is the build up of toxins in a food chain. The DDT concentration is in parts per million. As the trophic level increases in a food chain, the amount of toxic build up increases. The x's represent the amount of toxic build up accumulating as the trophic level increases. Toxins build up in organism's fat and tissue. Predators accumulate higher toxins than prey. ]]
Biological magnification often refers to the process whereby certain substances such as pesticides or heavy metals work their way into lakes, rivers and the ocean, and then move up the [[food chain]] in progressively greater concentrations as they are incorporated into the diet of aquatic organisms such as [[zooplankton]], which in turn are eaten perhaps by fish, which then may be eaten by bigger fish, large birds, animals, or humans. The substances become increasingly concentrated in tissues or internal organs as they move up the chain. Bioaccumulants are substances that increase in concentration in living organisms as they take in '''contaminated air, water, or food''' because the substances are very slowly metabolized or excreted.

==Processes==
Although sometimes used interchangeably with "[[bioaccumulation]]", an important distinction is drawn between the two, and with bioconcentration.
* '''Bioaccumulation''' occurs ''within'' a [[trophic level]], and is the increase in the concentration of a substance in certain tissues of organisms' bodies due to absorption from food and the environment.
* '''[[Bioconcentration]]''' is defined as occurring when uptake from the water is greater than excretion.&lt;ref&gt;Landrum, PF and SW Fisher, 1999. Influence of lipids on the bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of organic contaminants in aquatic organisms. Chapter 9 in MT Arts and BC Wainman. Lipids in fresh water ecosystems. Springer Verlag, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, bioconcentration and bioaccumulation occur within an organism, and biomagnification occurs across trophic (food chain) levels.

[[Biodilution]] is also a process that occurs to all trophic levels in an aquatic environment; it is the opposite of biomagnification, thus when a pollutant gets smaller in concentration as it progresses up a food web.

[[Lipid]], ([[lipophilic]]) or fat soluble substances cannot be diluted, broken down, or excreted in [[urine]], a water-based medium, and so accumulate in [[adipose tissue|fatty tissues]] of an organism, if the organism lacks [[enzyme]]s to degrade them. When eaten by another organism, fats are absorbed in the gut, carrying the substance, which then accumulates in the fats of the predator. Since at each level of the food chain there is a lot of energy loss, a predator must consume many prey, including all of their lipophilic substances.

For example, though [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] is only present in small amounts in [[seawater]], it is absorbed by algae (generally as [[methylmercury]]). Methyl-mercury is the most harmful variation of mercury. It is efficiently absorbed, but only very slowly excreted by organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Croteau, M., S. N. Luoma, and A. R Stewart. 2005. Trophic transfer of metals along freshwater food webs: Evidence of cadmium biomagnification in nature. Limnol. Oceanogr. 50 (5): 1511-1519.&lt;/ref&gt; Bioaccumulation and bioconcentration result in buildup in the adipose tissue of successive trophic levels: [[zooplankton]], small [[nekton]], larger fish, etc. Anything which eats these fish also consumes the higher level of mercury the fish have accumulated. This process explains why predatory fish such as [[swordfish]] and [[shark]]s or birds like [[osprey]] and [[eagle]]s have higher concentrations of mercury in their tissue than could be accounted for by direct exposure alone. For example, herring contains mercury at approximately 0.01 parts per million (ppm) and shark contains mercury at greater than 1 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). 1997. Mercury Study Report to Congress. Vol. IV: An Assessment of Exposure to Mercury in the United States . EPA-452/R-97-006. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards and Office of Research and Development.&lt;/ref&gt;

DDT is thought to biomagnify and biomagnification is one of the most significant reasons it was deemed harmful to the environment by the [[EPA]] and other organizations. DDT is stored in the fat of animals and takes many years to break down, and as the fat is consumed by predators, the amounts of DDT biomagnify. DDT is now a banned substance in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.epa.gov/aboutepa/ddt-ban-takes-effect |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812210501/http://www2.epa.gov/aboutepa/ddt-ban-takes-effect |archivedate=2014-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current status ==
In a review of a large number of studies, Suedel et al.&lt;ref&gt;Suedel, B.C., Boraczek, J.A., Peddicord, R.K., Clifford, P.A. and Dillon, T.M., 1994. Trophic transfer and biomagnification potential of contaminants in [[aquatic ecosystem]]s. Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology 136: 21–89.&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that although biomagnification is probably more limited in occurrence than previously thought, there is good evidence that [[DDT]], [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]], [[toxaphene]], and the organic forms of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[arsenic]] do biomagnify in nature. For other contaminants, bioconcentration and bioaccumulation account for their high concentrations in organism tissues. More recently, Gray&lt;ref&gt;Gray, J.S., 2002. Biomagnification in marine systems: the perspective of an ecologist. Mar. Pollut. Bull. 45: 46–52.&lt;/ref&gt; reached a similar substances remaining in the organisms and not being diluted to non-threatening concentrations. The success of top predatory-bird recovery ([[bald eagle]]s, [[peregrine falcon]]s) in North America following the ban on DDT use in agriculture is testament to the importance of biomagnification.

== Substances that biomagnify ==
There are two main groups of substances that biomagnify. Both are lipophilic and not easily degraded. Novel organic substances are not easily degraded because organisms lack previous exposure and have thus not [[evolved]] specific detoxification and excretion mechanisms, as there has been no selection pressure from them. These substances are consequently known as "[[persistent organic pollutant]]s" or POPs.

Metals are not degradable because they are elements. Organisms, particularly those subject to naturally high levels of exposure to metals, have mechanisms to sequester and excrete metals. Problems arise when organisms are exposed to higher concentrations than usual, which they cannot excrete rapidly enough to prevent damage. Some persistent [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]] are especially dangerous and harmful to the organism's reproductive system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8212">'''Build the Enterprise''' is a project to create a real-life version of the [[Starship Enterprise|''Starship'' Enterprise]], the [[spaceship]] featured in the science fiction television show [[Star Trek]].&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|last=Build the Enterprise|title=About|url=http://www.buildtheenterprise.org/about|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is detailed on its website, [http://www.buildtheenterprise.org/ Build the Enterprise], and is spearheaded by an [[engineer]] who goes by the name BTE Dan. He cites himself as a [[systems engineer]] and [[electrical engineer]] who has worked at a [[Fortune 500]] company for the past 30 years.&lt;ref name="NBC First"&gt;{{cite web|last=Atkinson|first=Nancy|title=Spaceship Enterprise in 20 years? Beam me up!|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/47396187/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/spaceship-enterprise-years-beam-me/#.UxpcBEtX_Ww|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship would be able to carry the personnel, supplies and equipment needed for a long journey or colonization of another planet.

==History==
The website was launched in May 2012.&lt;ref name="NBC First"/&gt; It gained widespread recognition after the story was covered by the major news corporations [[NBCNews]],&lt;ref name="NBC First"/&gt; [[Huffington Post]],&lt;ref name=HP&gt;{{cite web|last=Palis|first=Courteney|title=Engineer Wants Us To Build Real-Life Starship Enterprise|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/14/real-life-starship-enterprise_n_1514372.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mail Online]].&lt;ref name="Mail Online"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wrenn|first=Eddie|title=Let's build the Enterprise!

The petition stated that [[NASA]] should do a [[feasibility study]] of the project.&lt;ref name=Petition&gt;{{cite web|author=BTE Dan|title=Official BuildTheEnterprise White House Petition Started Today!|url=http://www.buildtheenterprise.org/official-buildtheenterprise-white-house-petition-started-today|publisher=BTE Blog|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A petition on the website requires 25,000 signatures in 30 days to merit the attention of the White House&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. However, the petition only received 7,200 signatures.&lt;ref name="Dead NBC"&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyle|first=Alan|title=It's dead, Jim: White House petition to build Starship Enterprise fizzles|url=http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/01/23/16665671-its-dead-jim-white-house-petition-to-build-starship-enterprise-fizzles?lite|publisher=NBC News|date=January 23, 2013|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propulsion==
According to the original proposal, still found on the site's home page, the Gen1 Enterprise will have 3 main engines. They will be [[ion thrusters]] that give constant acceleration. This acceleration will be slow, but over time it will allow the ship to travel at great speeds. The engines will be powered [[Nuclear Power|nuclearly]].&lt;ref name=Engines&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Build the Enterprise|title=Engines|url=http://www.buildtheenterprise.org/engines|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nuclear power system will also be used to power the ship's lighting, controls, and all other equipment on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Build the Enterprise|title=Nuclear Power System|url=http://www.buildtheenterprise.org/nuclear-reactors|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the main engines, there will be [[impulse engine]]s for short bursts of thrust. They will be used to help the ship exit from [[orbit]] around a [[planet]] or [[Natural satellite|moon]] quickly. They will also be used when emergency short bursts of power are needed to avoid obstacles. Unlike the main engines, the impulse engines must be much more powerful. Therefore, they will be powered by [[liquid propellant]] made of [[liquid Hydrogen]] and [[liquid Oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Build the Enterprise|title=Impulse Engines|url=http://www.buildtheenterprise.org/impulse-engines|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent ongoing activity in the site's forums pages have since offered numerous alternatives to this original proposal. Among these, rather than one of the variants of traditional ion engines, the use of VASIMR engines is currently being strongly considered, although this would still be powered by the 2.5 GigaWatt (output) nuclear power plants. Other possible alternatives for the main propulsion and power sources are being considered as new technologies are steadily coming into existence and being tested.
Likewise, plans for the "impulse" engines are being modified, as conventional thrusters are considered too weak to be of any practical use. One option proposed would be to tap the nuclear generators directly as nuclearthermal rockets similar to the NERVA concept. Chemical rockets might still be useful as part of a reaction control thruster system, for very fine maneuvers.

==Warp drive==
{{Also|White–Juday warp-field interferometer}}

In [[Houston, Texas]], at the [[Johnson Space Center]], [[Harold G. White|Harold White]] is working to create a [[warp drive]] that could be used for propulsion. Although this project is not related to the project proposed by BTE Dan, it could still possibly be used in a future version of the ''Enterprise''. The project is based on [[Miguel Alcubierre]]'s spacetime metric. The warp drive would allow the ship to travel faster than the speed of light by compressing space around it to create a moving bubble. As of yet however, there still remain many problems with the theory.&lt;ref name=Warp&gt;{{cite web|last=Kakaes|first=Konstantin|title=Warp Factor|url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-03/warp-factor?nopaging=1|publisher=Popular Science|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The Gen1 Enterprise is slated to cost $706 billion [[USD]]. This doesn't include costs to launch the needed parts into space, however. The total cost for the project is estimated at $983 billion USD.&lt;ref name=Cost&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Build the Enterprise|title=Cost &amp; Mass|url=http://www.buildtheenterprise.org/cost-mass|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that [[NASA]] will create a program to build the spacecraft. The ship will take about 20 years to build, and [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] will allocate 0.27% of the United States' [[Gross Domestic Product]] each year to the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Build the Enterprise|title=Funding &amp; Politics|url=http://www.buildtheenterprise.org/funding-politics|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to the Television Show==
''Note: For more information on the original starship, see'' ''[[Starship Enterprise]]''

The spaceship that is proposed to be built is named the Gen1 Enterprise. Unlike the original ''Enterprise'', the [[hangar]] deck will be at the underside of the saucer [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] instead of the lower hull section.

The '''Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy''' ('''CCCEP''') is a climate change research centre in [[England]]. It is hosted jointly by the [[University of Leeds]] and the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] (LSE).

CCCEP is part of the [[Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment]], which is chaired by Lord [[Nicholas Stern]] of Brentford, former [[Chief Economist]] of the [[World Bank]] and author of the widely known [[Stern Review]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Black, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8571347.stm Copenhagen climate summit undone by 'arrogance'], [[BBC News]], 16 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

CCCEP was established in 2008, and is funded by the [[ESRC]].{{fact|date=December 2013}}
Its mission is to advance public and private action on climate change through rigorous, innovative research.
In pursuit of its mission, CCCEP has five research themes in its phase 2 programme:{{fact|date=November 2013}}

# ''Understanding green growth and climate-compatible development''
# ''Advancing climate finance and investment''
# ''Evaluating the performance of climate policies''
# ''Managing climate risks and uncertainties and strengthening climate services''
# ''Enabling rapid transitions in mitigation and adaptation''

In October 2016, The Daily mail reported allegations that CCCEP had fraudulently obtained millions of dollars from UK taxpayers by claiming credit for research they did not produce.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3863462/Exposed-university-helped-secure-9million-money-passing-rivals-research-bankroll-climate-change-agenda.html&lt;/ref&gt; The organization responded to the claims saying that the alleged fraud was an overreaction to a clerical error. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cccep.ac.uk/news/response-to-article-by-david-rose-in-the-mail-on-sunday/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Quakingfallcolors.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|Many organisms, including [[aspen tree]]s, reproduce by cloning]]
'''Cloning''' is the process of producing [[genetics|genetically]] identical individuals of an [[organism]] either naturally or artificially. In nature, many organisms produce clones through [[asexual reproduction]]. Cloning in [[biotechnology]] refers to the process of creating clones of organisms or copies of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s or [[DNA]] fragments ([[molecular cloning]]). Beyond [[biology]], the term refers to the production of multiple copies of [[digital media]] or [[software]].

The term '''clone''', invented by [[J. B. S. Haldane]], is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word [[wikt:κλών#Ancient Greek|κλών]] ''klōn'', "twig", referring to the process whereby a new plant can be created from a twig. In botany, the term '''lusus''' was traditionally used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=de Candolle, A.|year=1868|title=Laws of Botanical Nomenclature adopted by the International Botanical Congress held at Paris in August 1867; together with an Historical Introduction and Commentary by Alphonse de Candolle, Translated from the French|publisher=L.

Weddell}}{{rp|21, 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[horticulture]], the spelling ''clon'' was used until the twentieth century; the final ''e'' came into use to indicate the vowel is a "long o" instead of a "short o".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Natural cloning==
Cloning is a natural form of reproduction that has allowed life forms to spread for hundreds of millions of years. It is the reproduction method used by [[plant]]s, [[fungi]], and [[bacteria]], and is also the way that [[Clonal colony|clonal colonies]] reproduce themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exn.ca/Stories/1996/10/21/01.asp |title=Tasmanian bush could be oldest living organism |accessdate=2008-05-07 |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723041627/http://www.exn.ca/Stories/1996/10/21/01.asp |archivedate=23 July 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiza-spotlight.com/news/2006/monster_plant_280506_i.htm |title=Ibiza's Monster Marine Plant |accessdate=2008-05-07 |publisher=Ibiza Spotlight |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226063158/http://www.ibiza-spotlight.com/news/2006/monster_plant_280506_i.htm |archivedate=26 December 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these organisms include [[Vaccinium corymbosum|blueberry plants]], [[Hazel|hazel trees]], [[Pando (tree)|the Pando trees]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=DeWoody, J. |author2=Rowe, C.A. |author3=Hipkins, V.D. |author4=Mock, K.E. |date=2008 |title= "Pando" Lives: Molecular Genetic Evidence of a Giant Aspen Clone in Central Utah |journal=Western North American Naturalist |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=493–497 |doi=10.3398/1527-0904-68.4.493|url=http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/wnan/vol68/iss4/8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NALDC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/27665/PDF | title=Blackwell Publishing Ltd Clonal dynamics in western North American aspen (Populus tremuloides) | publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture, Oxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltd | date=2008 | accessdate=2013-12-05 | authors=Mock, K.E., Rowe, C.A., Hooten, M.B., Dewoody, J., Hipkins, V.D. | pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Kentucky coffeetree]], ''[[Myrica]]''s, and the [[Liquidambar styraciflua|American sweetgum.]]

==Molecular cloning==
{{Main|Molecular cloning}}
Molecular cloning refers to the process of making multiple molecules. Cloning is commonly used to amplify [[DNA]] fragments containing whole [[genes]], but it can also be used to amplify any DNA sequence such as [[Promoter (biology)|promoters]], non-coding sequences and randomly fragmented DNA. It is used in a wide array of biological experiments and practical applications ranging from [[genetic fingerprinting]] to large scale protein production. Occasionally, the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the [[chromosome|chromosomal]] location of a gene associated with a particular phenotype of interest, such as in [[positional cloning]]. In practice, localization of the gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant genomic sequence. To amplify any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be linked to an [[origin of replication]], which is a sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself and any linked sequence. However, a number of other features are needed, and a variety of specialised [[cloning vector]]s (small piece of DNA into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted) exist that allow [[protein production]], [[affinity tag]]ging, single stranded [[RNA]] or DNA production and a host of other molecular biology tools.

Cloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves four steps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=iGenetics: A Molecular Approach |author= Peter J. Russel |year= 2005 |isbn=978-0-8053-4665-7 |location=San Francisco, California, United States of America |publisher=Pearson Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# fragmentation - breaking apart a strand of DNA
# [[DNA ligase|ligation]] - gluing together pieces of DNA in a desired sequence
# [[transfection]] – inserting the newly formed pieces of DNA into cells
# screening/selection – selecting out the cells that were successfully transfected with the new DNA

Although these steps are invariable among cloning procedures a number of alternative routes can be selected;  these are summarized as a ''cloning strategy''.

Initially, the DNA of interest needs to be isolated to provide a DNA segment of suitable size. Subsequently, a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a [[vector (molecular biology)|vector]] (piece of DNA). The vector (which is frequently circular) is linearised using [[restriction enzyme]]s, and incubated with the fragment of interest under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called [[DNA ligase]]. Following ligation the vector with the insert of interest is transfected into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitivation of cells, [[electroporation]], [[optical injection]] and [[biolistics]]. Finally, the transfected cells are cultured. As the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency, there is a need to identify the cells that have been successfully transfected with the vector construct containing the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation. Modern cloning vectors include selectable [[antibiotic]] resistance markers, which allow only cells in which the vector has been transfected, to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers, which provide blue/white screening (alpha-factor complementation) on [[X-gal]] medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained. Further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful. This may be accomplished by means of [[PCR]], restriction fragment analysis and/or [[DNA sequencing]].

== Cell cloning ==

===Cloning unicellular organisms===
[[File:Human cell-line colony being cloned in vitro through use of cloning rings.jpg|right|thumb|Cloning cell-line colonies using cloning rings]]
Cloning a cell means to derive a population of cells from a single cell. In the case of unicellular organisms such as bacteria and yeast, this process is remarkably simple and essentially only requires the [[inoculation]] of the appropriate medium. However, in the case of cell cultures from multi-cellular organisms, cell cloning is an arduous task as these cells will not readily grow in standard media.

A useful tissue culture technique used to clone distinct lineages of cell lines involves the use of cloning rings (cylinders).&lt;ref name="CloningRings"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFarland|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas McFarland|year=2000|title= Preparation of pure cell cultures by cloning|journal=Methods in Cell Science|volume=22|issue=1|pages=63–66|pmid=10650336|doi= 10.1023/A:1009838416621}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this technique a single-cell suspension of cells that have been exposed to a [[mutagen|mutagenic agent]] or drug used to drive [[Selection (biology)|selection]] is plated at high dilution to create isolated colonies, each arising from a single and potentially clonal distinct cell. At an early growth stage when colonies consist of only a few cells, sterile [[polystyrene]] rings (cloning rings), which have been dipped in grease, are placed over an individual colony and a small amount of [[trypsin]] is added. Cloned cells are collected from inside the ring and transferred to a new vessel for further growth.

=== Cloning stem cells ===
{{Main|Somatic-cell nuclear transfer}}
[[Somatic-cell nuclear transfer]], known as SCNT, can also be used to create embryos for research or therapeutic purposes. The most likely purpose for this is to produce embryos for use in [[stem cell research]]. This process is also called "research cloning" or "therapeutic cloning." The goal is not to create cloned human beings (called "reproductive cloning"), but rather to harvest stem cells that can be used to study human development and to potentially treat disease. While a clonal human blastocyst has been created, stem cell lines are yet to be isolated from a clonal source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/blog/2008/01/california_biot.html|title=California biotech says it cloned a human embryo, but no stem cells produced|first=Gideon|last=Gil|publisher=Boston Globe|date=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therapeutic cloning is achieved by creating embryonic stem cells in the hopes of treating diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's. The process begins by removing the nucleus (containing the DNA) from an egg cell and inserting a nucleus from the adult cell to be cloned.&lt;ref name="Halim"&gt;{{cite web |last=Halim |first=N. |date=September 2002 |title=Extensive new study shows abnormalities in cloned animals |accessdate=October 31, 2011 |publisher=Massachusetts institute of technology |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2002/cloning-0911.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of someone with Alzheimer's disease, the nucleus from a skin cell of that patient is placed into an empty egg. The reprogrammed cell begins to develop into an embryo because the egg reacts with the transferred nucleus. The embryo will become genetically identical to the patient.&lt;ref name=Halim /&gt; The embryo will then form a blastocyst which has the potential to form/become any cell in the body.&lt;ref name="Plus"&gt;{{cite web |last=Plus |first=M. |year=2011 |title= Fetal development |accessdate=October 31, 2011 |url= https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002398.htm |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason why SCNT is used for cloning is because somatic cells can be easily acquired and cultured in the lab. This process can either add or delete specific genomes of farm animals. A key point to remember is that cloning is achieved when the oocyte maintains its normal functions and instead of using sperm and egg genomes to replicate, the oocyte is inserted into the donor's somatic cell nucleus.&lt;ref name="Latham"&gt;{{cite web |last=Latham |first=K. E. |year=2005 |title=Early and delayed aspects of nuclear reprogramming during cloning |publisher=Biology of the Cell |pages=97, 119–132 |url=http://submit.biolcell.org/boc/097/0119/0970119.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802122210/http://submit.biolcell.org/boc/097/0119/0970119.pdf |archivedate=2 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oocyte will react on the somatic cell nucleus, the same way it would on sperm cells.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt;

The process of cloning a particular farm animal using SCNT is relatively the same for all animals. The first step is to collect the somatic cells from the animal that will be cloned. The somatic cells could be used immediately or stored in the laboratory for later use.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt; The hardest part of SCNT is removing maternal DNA from an oocyte at metaphase II. Once this has been done, the somatic nucleus can be inserted into an egg cytoplasm.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt; This creates a one-cell embryo. The grouped somatic cell and egg cytoplasm are then introduced to an electrical current.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt; This energy will hopefully allow the cloned embryo to begin development. The successfully developed embryos are then placed in surrogate recipients, such as a cow or sheep in the case of farm animals.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt;

SCNT is seen as a good method for producing agriculture animals for food consumption. It successfully cloned sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs. Another benefit is SCNT is seen as a solution to clone endangered species that are on the verge of going extinct.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt; However, stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus can be enormous, which led to a high loss in resulting cells in early research. For example, [[Dolly (sheep)|the cloned sheep Dolly]] was born after 277 eggs were used for SCNT, which created 29 viable embryos. Only three of these embryos survived until birth, and only one survived to adulthood.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Campbell KH, McWhir J, Ritchie WA, Wilmut I |title=Sheep cloned by nuclear transfer from a cultured cell line |journal=Nature |volume=380 |issue=6569 |pages=64–6 |date=March 1996 |pmid=8598906 |doi=10.1038/380064a0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the procedure could not be automated, and had to be performed manually under a [[microscope]], SCNT was very resource intensive. The biochemistry involved in reprogramming the [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] somatic cell nucleus and activating the recipient egg was also far from being well understood. However, by 2014 researchers were reporting cloning success rates of seven to eight out of ten&lt;ref&gt;Shukman, David (14 January 2014) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25576718 China cloning on an 'industrial scale'] BBC News Science and Environment, Retrieved 10 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016, a Korean Company Sooam Biotech was reported to be producing 500 cloned embryos per day.&lt;ref name="NewScientist500"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zastrow|first1=Mark|title=Inside the cloning factory that creates 500 new animals a day|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2076681-inside-the-cloning-factory-that-creates-500-new-animals-a-day/|accessdate=23 February 2016|publisher=New Scientist|date=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In SCNT, not all of the donor cell's genetic information is transferred, as the donor cell's [[mitochondria]] that contain their own [[mitochondrial DNA]] are left behind. The resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg. As a consequence, clones such as Dolly that are born from SCNT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus.

== Organism cloning ==
{{See also|Asexual reproduction|Cuttings (plants)|vegetative reproduction}}
'''Organism cloning''' (also called reproductive cloning) refers to the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another. In essence this form of cloning is an asexual method of reproduction, where fertilization or inter-gamete contact does not take place. Asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring phenomenon in many species, including most plants and some insects. Scientists have made some major achievements with cloning, including the asexual reproduction of sheep and cows. There is a lot of ethical debate over whether or not cloning should be used. However, cloning, or asexual propagation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/plantanswers/misc/asexualpropagation.html |title=Asexual Propagation |publisher=Aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been common practice in the horticultural world for hundreds of years.

=== Horticultural ===
[[File:Vine shoots.JPG|thumb|Propagating plants from [[cuttings (plants)|cuttings]], such as grape vines, is an ancient form of cloning]]
{{For|the use of cloning in viticulture|Propagation of grapevines}}
The term ''clone'' is used in horticulture to refer to descendants of a single plant which were produced by [[vegetative reproduction]] or [[apomixis]]. Many horticultural plant [[cultivar]]s are clones, having been derived from a single individual, multiplied by some process other than sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Sagers, Larry A. (2 March 2009) [http://www.usu.edu/ust/pdf/2009/march/itn03030976.pdf Proliferate favorite trees by grafting, cloning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301102536/http://www.usu.edu/ust/pdf/2009/march/itn03030976.pdf |date=1 March 2014 }} Utah Stae University, Deseret News (Salt Lake City) Retrieved 21 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, some European cultivars of [[grape]]s represent clones that have been propagated for over two millennia. Other examples are [[potato]] and [[banana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1102001108| title = Multidisciplinary perspectives on banana (''Musa'' spp.) domestication| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 108| url = http://www.agr.kuleuven.ac.be/nieuws/fiches/PNAS-110720.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130704133315/http://www.agr.kuleuven.ac.be/nieuws/fiches/PNAS-110720.pdf| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2013-07-04| issue = 28| pages = 11311–11318| year = 2011| last1 = Perrier| first1 = X.| last2 = De Langhe| first2 = E.| last3 = Donohue| first3 = M.| last4 = Lentfer| first4 = C.| last5 = Vrydaghs| first5 = L.| last6 = Bakry| first6 = F.| last7 = Carreel| first7 = F.| last8 = Hippolyte| first8 = I.| last9 = Horry| first9 = J. -P.| last10 = Jenny| first10 = C.| last11 = Lebot| first11 = V.| last12 = Risterucci| first12 = A. -M.| last13 = Tomekpe| first13 = K.| last14 = Doutrelepont| first14 = H.| last15 = Ball| first15 = T.| last16 = Manwaring| first16 = J.| last17 = De Maret| first17 = P.| last18 = Denham| first18 = T.| pmid = 21730145| pmc = 3136277}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grafting]] can be regarded as cloning, since all the shoots and branches coming from the graft are genetically a clone of a single individual, but this particular kind of cloning has not come under [[ethics|ethical]] scrutiny and is generally treated as an entirely different kind of operation.

Many [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, [[vine]]s, [[fern]]s and other [[perennials|herbaceous perennial]]s form [[clonal colony|clonal colonies]] naturally. Parts of an individual plant may become detached by [[Fragmentation (cell biology)|fragmentation]] and grow on to become separate clonal individuals. A common example is in the vegetative reproduction of moss and liverwort gametophyte clones by means of [[gemma (botany)|gemmae]]. Some vascular plants e.g. [[dandelion]] and certain [[viviparity|viviparous]] grasses also form [[seed]]s asexually, termed [[apomixis]], resulting in clonal populations of genetically identical individuals.

=== Parthenogenesis ===
Clonal derivation exists in nature in some animal species and is referred to as [[parthenogenesis]] (reproduction of an organism by itself without a mate). This is an asexual form of reproduction that is only found in females of some insects, crustaceans, nematodes,&lt;ref&gt;Castagnone-Sereno P, et al. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23682915 Diversity and evolution of root-knot nematodes, genus Meloidogyne: new insights from the genomic era] Annu Rev Phytopathol. 2013;51:203-20&lt;/ref&gt; fish (for example the [[hammerhead shark]]&lt;ref name =NYTShubin&gt;Shubin, Neil (24 February 2008) [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/opinion/24shubin.html Birds Do It. Bees Do It. Dragons Don’t Need To] New York Times, Retrieved 21 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;), the [[Komodo dragon]]&lt;ref name =NYTShubin/&gt; and [[whiptail lizard|lizards]]. The growth and development occurs without fertilization by a male. In plants, parthenogenesis means the development of an embryo from an unfertilized egg cell, and is a component process of apomixis. In species that use the [[XY sex-determination system]], the offspring will always be female. An example is the little fire ant (''[[Wasmannia auropunctata]]''), which is native to [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] but has spread throughout many tropical environments.

=== Artificial cloning of organisms ===
Artificial cloning of organisms may also be called ''reproductive cloning''.

==== First steps ====
[[Hans Spemann]], a [[Germans|German]] [[embryologist]] was awarded a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1935 for his discovery of the effect now known as embryonic induction, exercised by various parts of the embryo, that directs the development of groups of cells into particular tissues and organs. In 1928 he and his student, [[Hilde Mangold]], were the first to perform [[somatic-cell nuclear transfer]] using [[amphibian]] embryos – one of the first steps towards cloning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Robertis|first1=EM|title=Spemann's organizer and self-regulation in amphibian embryos|journal=Nature Reviews.

See [http://www.nature.com/nrm/journal/v7/n4/box/nrm1855_BX1.html Box 1: Explanation of the Spemann-Mangold experiment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Methods ====
Reproductive cloning generally uses "[[somatic cell nuclear transfer]]" (SCNT) to create animals that are genetically identical. This process entails the transfer of a nucleus from a donor adult cell (somatic cell) to an egg from which the nucleus has been removed, or to a cell from a [[blastocyst]] from which the nucleus has been removed.&lt;ref name=HumanGenomeInfo&gt;{{cite web|title=Cloning Fact Sheet|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml|publisher=Human Genome Project Information|accessdate=25 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502125744/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml|archivedate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the egg begins to divide normally it is transferred into the uterus of the surrogate mother. Such clones are not strictly identical since the somatic cells may contain mutations in their nuclear DNA. Additionally, the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] in the [[cytoplasm]] also contains DNA and during SCNT this mitochondrial DNA is wholly from the cytoplasmic donor's egg, thus the [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] genome is not the same as that of the nucleus donor cell from which it was produced. This may have important implications for cross-species nuclear transfer in which nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibilities may lead to death.

Artificial ''embryo splitting'' or ''embryo twinning'', a technique that creates monozygotic twins from a single embryo, is not considered in the same fashion as other methods of cloning. During that procedure, a donor [[embryo]] is split in two distinct embryos, that can then be transferred via [[embryo transfer]]. It is optimally performed at the 6- to 8-cell stage, where it can be used as an expansion of [[IVF]] to increase the number of available embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Illmensee K, Levanduski M, Vidali A, Husami N, Goudas VT |title=Human embryo twinning with applications in reproductive medicine |journal=Fertil.

[[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly]], a [[Finn-Dorset]] [[domestic sheep|ewe]], was the first mammal to have been successfully cloned from an adult somatic cell. Dolly was formed by taking a cell from the udder of her 6-year old biological mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rantala, Milgram|first=M., Arthur|title=Cloning: For and Against|year=1999|publisher=Carus Publishing Company|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-0-8126-9375-1|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolly's embryo was created by taking the cell and inserting it into a sheep ovum. It took 434 attempts before an embryo was successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swedin|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric G.

She was born on 5 July 1996 but not announced to the world until 22 February 1997.&lt;ref name=Credo&gt;{{cite web |last=Swedin |first=Eric |title=Cloning |url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/abccscience/cloning |website=CredoReference|publisher=Science in the Contemporary World|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[Taxidermy|stuffed remains]] were placed at Edinburgh's [[Royal Museum]], part of the [[National Museums of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;TV documentary Visions Of The Future part 2 shows this process, explores the social implicatins of cloning and contains footage of monoculture in livestock&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolly was publicly significant because the effort showed that genetic material from a specific adult cell, programmed to express only a distinct subset of its genes, can be reprogrammed to grow an entirely new organism. Before this demonstration, it had been shown by John Gurdon that nuclei from differentiated cells could give rise to an entire organism after transplantation into an enucleated egg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gurdon J | journal=Dev. Biol. | date= Apr 1962 | volume=4| issue=2 | pages=256–73 | title=Adult frogs derived from the nuclei of single somatic cells | pmid= 13903027 | doi=10.1016/0012-1606(62)90043-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this concept was not yet demonstrated in a mammalian system.

The first mammalian cloning (resulting in Dolly the sheep) had a success rate of 29 embryos per 277 fertilized eggs, which produced three lambs at birth, one of which lived. In a bovine experiment involving 70 cloned calves, one-third of the calves died young. The first successfully cloned horse, [[Prometea]], took 814 attempts. Notably, although the first{{clarify|does this mean "first vertebrate"?|date=February 2016}} clones were frogs, no adult cloned frog has yet been produced from a somatic adult nucleus donor cell.

There were early claims that [[Dolly the sheep]] had pathologies resembling accelerated aging. Scientists speculated that Dolly's death in 2003 was related to the shortening of [[telomere]]s, DNA-protein complexes that protect the end of linear [[chromosome]]s. However, other researchers, including [[Ian Wilmut]] who led the team that successfully cloned Dolly, argue that Dolly's early death due to respiratory infection was unrelated to deficiencies with the cloning process. This idea that the nuclei have not irreversibly aged was shown in 2013 to be true for mice.&lt;ref name="Wakayama" /&gt;

Dolly was named after performer [[Dolly Parton]] because the cells cloned to make her were from a [[mammary gland]] cell, and Parton is known for her ample cleavage.&lt;ref name=BBCname&gt;BBC. 22 February 2008.

==== Human cloning ====
{{Main|Human cloning}}
Human cloning is the creation of a genetically identical copy of a human. The term is generally used to refer to artificial human cloning, which is the reproduction of human cells and tissues. It does not refer to the natural conception and delivery of [[monozygotic|identical]] [[multiple birth|twins]].  The possibility of human cloning has raised [[ethics of cloning|controversies]]. These ethical concerns have prompted several nations to pass [[legislation]] regarding human cloning and its legality. As of right now, scientists have no intention of trying to clone people and they believe their results should spark a wider discussion about the laws and regulations the world needs to regulate cloning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martinez|first1=Bobby|title=WATCH: Scientists clone monkeys using technique that created Dolly the sheep|url=http://fox61.com/2018/01/25/watch-scientists-clone-monkeys-using-technique-that-created-dolly-the-sheep/|website=Fox61|publisher=fox61|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two commonly discussed types of theoretical human cloning are ''therapeutic cloning'' and ''reproductive cloning''. Therapeutic cloning would involve cloning cells from a human for use in medicine and transplants, and is an active area of research, but is not in medical practice anywhere in the world, {{as of|2014|lc=y}}. Two common methods of therapeutic cloning that are being researched are [[somatic-cell nuclear transfer]] and, more recently, [[Induced pluripotent stem cell|pluripotent stem cell induction]]. Reproductive cloning would involve making an entire cloned human, instead of just specific cells or tissues.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18523539 | volume=10 | issue=2 | title=Therapeutic cloning: promises and issues | pmc=2323472 | date=July 2007 | journal=Mcgill J Med | pages=112–20 | last1 = Kfoury | first1 = C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ethical issues of cloning ====
{{Main|Ethics of cloning}}

There are a variety of [[bioethics|ethical]] positions regarding the possibilities of cloning, especially [[human cloning]]. While many of these views are [[religious]] in origin, the questions raised by cloning are faced by [[secular]] perspectives as well.  Perspectives on human cloning are theoretical, as human therapeutic and reproductive cloning are not commercially used; animals are currently cloned in laboratories and in livestock production.

Advocates support development of therapeutic cloning in order to generate tissues and whole organs to treat patients who otherwise cannot obtain transplants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml#organsQ |title=Cloning Fact Sheet |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502125744/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy Genome Program |date=2009-05-11 |archivedate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid the need for [[immunosuppressive drugs]],&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; and to stave off the effects of aging.&lt;ref name=EndingAging&gt;de Grey, Aubrey; Rae, Michael (September 2007).

==== Cloning extinct and endangered species ====
Cloning, or more precisely, the reconstruction of functional DNA from [[extinct]] species has, for decades, been a dream.  Possible implications of this were dramatized in the 1984 novel ''[[Carnosaur (novel)|Carnosaur]]'' and the 1990 novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)#Biological issues and accuracy|Jurassic Park]]''.&lt;ref name=Holt/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrenfeld"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehrenfeld|first=David|authorlink=David Ehrenfeld|year=2006|title=Transgenics and Vertebrate Cloning as Tools for Species Conservation|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=20|issue=3|pages=723–732|pmid=16909565|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00399.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best current cloning techniques have an average success rate of 9.4 percent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Biol.

In 2001, a cow named Bessie gave birth to a cloned Asian [[gaur]], an endangered species, but the calf died after two days. In 2003, a [[banteng]] was successfully cloned, followed by three African wildcats from a thawed frozen embryo. These successes provided hope that similar techniques (using surrogate mothers of another species) might be used to clone extinct species. Anticipating this possibility, tissue samples from the last ''bucardo'' ([[Pyrenean ibex]]) were frozen in [[liquid nitrogen]] immediately after it died in 2000. Researchers are also considering cloning endangered species such as the giant panda and cheetah.

In 2002, geneticists at the [[Australian Museum]] announced that they had replicated DNA of the [[thylacine]] (Tasmanian tiger), at the time extinct for about 65 years, using [[polymerase chain reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/auspac/05/28/aust.thylacines/|title=Cloning to revive extinct species|first=Grant|last=Holloway|publisher=CNN.com|date=2002-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 15 February 2005 the museum announced that it was stopping the project after tests showed the specimens' DNA had been too badly degraded by the ([[ethanol]]) preservative. On 15 May 2005 it was announced that the thylacine project would be revived, with new participation from researchers in [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

In 2003, for the first time, an extinct animal, the Pyrenean ibex mentioned above was cloned, at the Centre of Food Technology and Research of Aragon, using the preserved frozen cell nucleus of the skin samples from 2001 and domestic goat egg-cells. The ibex died shortly after birth due to physical defects in its lungs.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news | title =Extinct ibex is resurrected by cloning | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/sciencenews/4409958/Extinct-ibex-is-resurrected-by-cloning.html | accessdate = 2009-02-01 |work = The Telegraph | location=London | first1=Richard | last1=Gray | first2=Roger | last2=Dobson | date=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most anticipated targets for cloning was once the [[woolly mammoth]], but attempts to extract DNA from frozen mammoths have been unsuccessful, though a joint Russo-Japanese team is currently working toward this goal.  In January 2011, it was reported by Yomiuri Shimbun that a team of scientists headed by Akira Iritani of Kyoto University had built upon research by Dr. Wakayama, saying that they will extract DNA from a mammoth carcass that had been preserved in a Russian laboratory and insert it into the egg cells of an African elephant in hopes of producing a mammoth embryo. The researchers said they hoped to produce a baby mammoth within six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3075381.stm|title=Scientists 'to clone mammoth'|publisher=BBC News|date=2003-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16068581 |title=BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-12-07 |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted, however that the result, if possible, would be an elephant-mammoth hybrid rather than a true mammoth.&lt;ref name=rure&gt;[http://expert.ru/russian_reporter/2015/05/kogda-oni-vernutsya/ "Когда вернутся мамонты"] ("When the Mammoths Return"), February 5, 2015 (retrieved September 6, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem is the survival of the reconstructed mammoth: [[ruminant]]s rely on a [[symbiosis]] with specific [[microbiota]] in their stomachs for digestion.&lt;ref name=rure/&gt;

Scientists at the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]] and [[University of New South Wales]] announced in March 2013 that the very recently extinct [[gastric-brooding frog]] would be the subject of a cloning attempt to resurrect the species.&lt;ref name="National Geographic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yong|first=Ed|title=Resurrecting the Extinct Frog with a Stomach for a Womb|website=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date=2013-03-15|url=http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/15/resurrecting-the-extinct-frog-with-a-stomach-for-a-womb/|accessdate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many such "De-extinction" projects are described in the [[Long Now Foundation]]'s Revive and Restore Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://longnow.org/revive/ | title=Long Now Foundation, Revive and Restore Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lifespan===
After an eight-year project involving the use of a pioneering cloning technique, Japanese researchers created 25 generations of healthy cloned mice with normal lifespans, demonstrating that clones are not intrinsically shorter-lived than naturally born animals.&lt;ref name="Wakayama"&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Cell Stem Cell | date = 7 March 2013  | volume=12 |issue=3 | pages=293–7 | title=Successful serial recloning in the mouse over multiple generations | authors=Wakayama S1, Kohda T, Obokata H, Tokoro M, Li C, Terashita Y, Mizutani E, Nguyen VT, Kishigami S, Ishino F, Wakayama T | pmid = 23472871 | doi=10.1016/j.stem.2013.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gen25"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/03/130307122958.htm|title=Generations of Cloned Mice With Normal Lifespans Created: 25th Generation and Counting|publisher=Science Daily|date=7 March 2013|accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources have noted that the offspring of clones tend to be healthier than the original clones and indistinguishable from animals produced naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Epigenetics Revolution|last=Carey|first=Nessa|publisher=Icon Books Ltd.|year=2012|isbn=978-184831-347-7|location=London, UK|pages=149–150|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolly the sheep was created from a six year old cell sample from a mammary gland. Because of this, she aged quicker than other naturally born animals because she was started from already aging cells. She died prematurely at six years old, not only from her age but from respiratory issues and severe arthritis. {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}{{dubious|date=August 2018}}

A detailed study released in 2016 and less detailed studies by others suggest that once cloned animals get past the first month or two of life they are generally healthy. However, early pregnancy loss and neonatal losses are still greater with cloning than natural conception or assisted reproduction (IVF). Current research is attempting to overcome these problems.&lt;ref name="BBCname" /&gt;

Discussion of cloning in the popular media often presents the subject negatively. In an article in the 8 November 1993 article of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', cloning was portrayed in a negative way, modifying Michelangelo's ''[[Creation of Adam]]'' to depict Adam with five identical hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIME Magazine – U.S. Edition –  Vol. 142 No. 19|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601931108,00.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105153733/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601931108,00.html|archivedate=5 November 2017|date=8 November 1993|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]''{{'s}} 10 March 1997 issue also critiqued the ethics of human cloning, and included a graphic depicting identical babies in beakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Today The Sheep…|journal=Newsweek|date=9 March 1997|url=http://www.newsweek.com/today-sheep-170570|accessdate=5 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of cloning, particularly human cloning, has featured a wide variety of [[science fiction]] works. An early fictional depiction of cloning is [[Bokanovsky's Process]] which features in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s 1931 dystopian novel ''[[Brave New World]]''. The process is applied to fertilized human [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] ''[[in vitro]]'', causing them to split into identical genetic copies of the original.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous; "Brave New World and Brave New World Revisited"; p. 19; HarperPerennial, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhelkar|first1=Ratnakar D.|title=Science Fiction: Fantasy and Reality|date=2009|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|isbn=9788126910366|page=58|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bvt_NyXYGb0C&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;pg=PA58|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following renewed interest in cloning in the 1950s, the subject was explored further in works such as [[Poul Anderson]]'s 1953 story ''UN-Man'', which describes a technology called "exogenesis", and [[Gordon Rattray Taylor]]'s book ''[[The Biological Time Bomb]]'', which popularised the term "cloning" in 1963.&lt;ref name="stableford"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stableford|first1=Brian M.|title=Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia|date=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780415974608|pages=91–92|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uefwmdROKTAC&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;pg=PA91|language=en|chapter=Clone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloning is a recurring theme in a number of contemporary science fiction films, ranging from action films such as ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993), ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' (1997), ''[[The 6th Day]]'' (2000), ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'' (2002), ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Star Wars: Episode II]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]'' (2005), to comedies such as [[Woody Allen]]'s 1973 film ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070707/|title=Sleeper (1973)|author=planktonrules|date=17 December 1973|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of cloning is represented variously in fiction. Many works depict the artificial creation of humans by a method of growing cells from a tissue or DNA sample; the replication may be instantaneous, or take place through slow growth of human embryos in [[artificial womb]]s. In the long-running British television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the [[Fourth Doctor]] and his companion [[Leela (Doctor Who)|Leela]] were cloned in a matter of seconds from DNA samples ("[[The Invisible Enemy (Doctor Who)|The Invisible Enemy]]", 1977) and then — in an apparent [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the 1966 film ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' — shrunk to microscopic size in order to enter the Doctor's body to combat an alien virus. The clones in this story are short-lived, and can only survive a matter of minutes before they expire.&lt;ref name="muir"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muir|first1=John Kenneth|title=A Critical History of Doctor Who on Television|date=2007|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476604541|pages=258–9|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qMKSCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA259&amp;pg=PA259|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction films such as ''[[The Matrix]]'' and ''Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones'' have featured scenes of human [[foetus]]es being cultured on an industrial scale in mechanical tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mumford|first1=James|title=Ethics at the Beginning of Life: A Phenomenological Critique|date=2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0199673964|page=108|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UCnmRCDGJ0cC&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;pg=PA108|accessdate=6 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloning humans from body parts is also a common theme in science fiction. Cloning features strongly among the science fiction conventions parodied in Woody Allen's ''Sleeper'', the plot of which centres around an attempt to clone an assassinated dictator from his disembodied nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Humber|first1=James M.|last2=Almeder|first2=Robert|title=Human Cloning|date=1998|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781592592050|page=10|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vNGUBwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=6 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2008 ''Doctor Who'' story "[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]", a duplicate version of the [[Tenth Doctor]] spontaneously grows from his severed hand, which had been cut off in a sword fight during an earlier episode.&lt;ref name="smithka"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Courtland|last2=Smithka|first2=Paula|title=Doctor Who and Philosophy: Bigger on the Inside|date=2010|publisher=Open Court|isbn=9780812697254|pages=32–33|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ShPnLHcKqUwC&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en|chapter=What's Continuity without Persistence?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of her beloved 14-year old Coton de Tulear named Samantha in late 2017, [[Barbra Streisand]] announced that she had cloned the dog, and was now "waiting for [the two cloned pups] to get older so [she] can see if they have [Samantha's] brown eyes and her seriousness." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/streisand-dog-clone-1.4555800?cmp=rss|title=Twice as nice: Barbra Streisand cloned her beloved dog and has 2 new pups|work=CBC News|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation cost $50,000 through the pet cloning company ViaGen.

===Cloning and identity===
Science fiction has used cloning, most commonly and specifically [[human cloning]], to raise the controversial questions of identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hopkins|first=Patrick|title=How Popular media represent cloning as an ethical problem|jstor=3527566|volume=28|issue=2|pages=6–13|doi=10.2307/3527566|pmid=9589288|journal=The Hastings Center Report|url=http://kie.georgetown.edu/nrcbl/documents/hcr/v28/h28n2p06.pdf|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csustan.edu/honors/documents/journals/thresholds/Delacruz.pdf |title=Yvonne A.

The story, set in the near future, is structured around the conflict between a father (Salter) and his sons (Bernard 1, Bernard 2, and Michael Black) – two of whom are clones of the first one. ''A Number'' was adapted by Caryl Churchill for television, in a co-production between the [[BBC]] and [[HBO Films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| title = Uma Thurman, Rhys Ifans and Tom Wilkinson star in two plays for BBC Two| publisher = BBC| date = 2008-06-19| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/06_june/19/stage.shtml| accessdate = 2008-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a Japanese television series named "Bunshin" was created. The story's main character, Mariko, is a woman studying child welfare in Hokkaido. She grew up always doubtful about the love from her mother, who looked nothing like her and who died nine years before. One day, she finds some of her mother's belongings at a relative's house, and heads to Tokyo to seek out the truth behind her birth. She later discovered that she was a clone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Review of Bunshin |url =http://doramaworld.blogspot.com/2012/06/review-of-bunshin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2013 television series ''[[Orphan Black]]'', cloning is used as a scientific study on the behavioral adaptation of the clones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2234222/|title=Orphan Black (TV Series 2013– )|author=foreverbounds|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, the book ''[[The Double (Saramago novel)|The Double]]'' by Nobel Prize winner [[José Saramago]] explores the emotional experience of a man who discovers that he is a clone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Banville |title='The Double': The Tears of a Clone|work=The New York Times |date=2004-10-10|accessdate=14 January 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/books/review/10BANV01.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloning as resurrection===
Cloning has been used in fiction as a way of recreating historical figures. In the 1976 [[Ira Levin]] novel ''[[The Boys from Brazil (novel)|The Boys from Brazil]]'' and its [[The Boys from Brazil (film)|1978 film adaptation]], [[Josef Mengele]] uses cloning to create copies of [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077269/|title=The Boys from Brazil (1978)|author=Christian Lee Pyle (CLPyle)|date=12 October 1978|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Michael Crichton]]'s 1990 novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'', which spawned a [[Jurassic Park|series of ''Jurassic Park'' feature films]], a bioengineering company develops a technique to resurrect extinct species of [[dinosaur]]s by creating cloned creatures using DNA extracted from [[fossil]]s. The cloned dinosaurs are used to populate the Jurassic Park [[Animal theme park|wildlife park]] for the entertainment of visitors. The scheme goes disastrously wrong when the dinosaurs escape their enclosures. Despite being selectively cloned as females to prevent them from breeding, the dinosaurs develop the ability to reproduce through [[parthenogenesis]].&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Daniel|title=Cloning|date=2002|publisher=Millbrook Press|isbn=9780761328025|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TpBEOaHhb4oC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloning for warfare===
The use of cloning for military purposes has also been explored in several fictional works. In ''Doctor Who'', an alien race of armour-clad, warlike beings called [[Sontaran]]s was introduced in the 1973 serial "[[The Time Warrior]]". Sontarans are depicted as squat, bald creatures who have been genetically engineered for combat. Their weak spot is a "probic vent", a small socket at the back of their neck which is associated with the cloning process.&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Dave|title=Doctor Who FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the Most Famous Time Lord in the Universe|date=2013|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=9781480342958|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QcEXAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT119&amp;pg=PT119|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of cloned soldiers being bred for combat was revisited in "[[The Doctor's Daughter]]" (2008), when the Doctor's DNA is used to create a female warrior called [[Jenny (Doctor Who)|Jenny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barr|first1=Jason|last2=Mustachio|first2=Camille D.

The 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' was set against the backdrop of a historical conflict called the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]]. The events of this war were not fully explored until the prequel films ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002) and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005), which depict a [[Space warfare in fiction|space war]] waged by a massive army of heavily armoured [[clone trooper]]s that leads to the foundation of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]. Cloned soldiers are "manufactured" on an industrial scale, genetically conditioned for obedience and combat effectiveness. It is also revealed that the popular character [[Boba Fett]] originated as a clone of [[Jango Fett]], a mercenary who served as the genetic template for the clone troopers.&lt;ref name="mcdonald"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McDonald|first1=Paul F.|title=The Star Wars Heresies: Interpreting the Themes, Symbols and Philosophies of Episodes I, II and III|date=2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786471812|pages=167–171|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wf4CAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;pg=PA167|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en|chapter=The Clones}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1185834/|title=Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008)|author=compel_bast|date=15 August 2008|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloning for exploitation===
A recurring sub-theme of cloning fiction is the use of clones as a supply of [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] for [[Organ transplant|transplantation]]. The 2005 [[Kazuo Ishiguro]] novel ''[[Never Let Me Go (novel)|Never Let Me Go]]'' and the [[Never Let Me Go (2010 film)|2010 film adaption]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334260/|title=Never Let Me Go (2010)|author=espenshade55|date=11 February 2011|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are set in an [[alternate history]] in which cloned humans are created for the sole purpose of providing organ donations to naturally born humans, despite the fact that they are fully sentient and self-aware. The 2005 film ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399201/|title=The Island (2005)|date=22 July 2005|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; revolves around a similar plot, with the exception that the clones are unaware of the reason for their existence.

The exploitation of human clones for dangerous and undesirable work was examined in the 2009 British science fiction film ''[[Moon (film)|Moon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/|title=Moon (2009)|author=larry-411|date=17 July 2009|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the futuristic novel ''[[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]]'' and subsequent [[Cloud Atlas (film)|film]], one of the story lines focuses on a genetically-engineered fabricant clone named Sonmi~451, one of millions raised in an artificial "wombtank," destined to serve from birth. She is one of thousands  created for manual and [[emotional labor]]; Sonmi herself works as a server in a restaurant. She later discovers that the sole source of food for clones, called 'Soap', is manufactured from the clones themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technewsdaily.com/8402-human-clones-cloud-atlas.html|title=Technology News – 2017 Innovations and Future Tech|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Doll fetishism''' is a [[sexual fetish]] in which an individual is attracted to [[doll]]s and doll like objects such as [[figurine]]s. The attraction may include the desire for actual sexual contact with a doll, a fantasy of a sexual encounter with an animate or inanimate doll, encounters between dolls themselves, or sexual pleasure gained from thoughts of being transformed or transforming another into a doll.

[[Roleplay]]
When the couple/significant enjoy being dressed up as a "doll", usually big lolita/victorian outifts/ or lingery undergarments in sexual ways. Can also include bondage like a marrionete or nicknames such as "Baby doll", "Doll", "little marrionete", and other names associated with the doll type style. This fetish is usually very pretty and pampered type [and very kinky at times].

==As a fantasy==

Though not common it can involve intercourse or other sexual activity with dolls.

'''Earthquake engineering''' is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that designs and analyzes structures, such as buildings and bridges, with [[earthquake]]s in mind. Its overall goal is to make such structures more resistant to earthquakes. An earthquake (or seismic) engineer aims to construct structures that will not be damaged in minor shaking and will avoid serious damage or collapse in a major earthquake. Earthquake engineering is the scientific field concerned with protecting society, the natural environment, and the man-made environment from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to socio-economically acceptable levels.&lt;ref name=Bozorgnia2004&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, it has been narrowly defined as the study of the behavior of structures and geo-structures subject to [[seismic loading]]; it is considered as a subset of [[structural engineering]], [[geotechnical engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[applied physics]], etc. However, the tremendous costs experienced in recent earthquakes have led to an expansion of its scope to encompass disciplines from the wider field of [[civil engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]] and from the [[social sciences]], especially [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[economics]] and [[finance]].

The main objectives of earthquake engineering are:
* Foresee the potential consequences of strong [[earthquakes]] on [[urban areas]] and civil infrastructure.
* Design, construct and maintain structures to [[seismic performance|perform]] at earthquake exposure up to the expectations and in compliance with [[building code]]s.&lt;ref name=SeismicDesignCodes&gt;{{cite book|title= Seismic Design Codes and Procedures|author=Berg, Glen V.|year=1983|publisher=EERI|isbn=0-943198-25-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Earthquake engineering structures|properly engineered structure]] does not necessarily have to be extremely strong or expensive. It has to be properly designed to withstand the seismic effects while sustaining an acceptable level of damage.

{{main article|Seismic loading}}

'''Seismic loading''' means application of an earthquake-generated excitation on a structure (or geo-structure). It happens at contact surfaces of a structure either with the ground,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthquake.geoengineer.org/|title=Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering|website=earthquake.geoengineer.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; with adjacent structures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civenv.unimelb.edu.au/ejse/Archives/Fulltext/2006/200608.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030041059/http://www.civenv.unimelb.edu.au/ejse/Archives/Fulltext/2006/200608.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or with [[gravity wave]]s from [[tsunami]]. The loading that is expected at a given location on the Earth's surface is estimated by engineering [[seismology]]. It is related to the [[seismic hazard]] of the location.

== Seismic performance ==
{{Main article|Seismic analysis}}

'''Earthquake''' or '''seismic performance''' defines a structure's ability to sustain its main functions, such as its [[safety]] and [[Serviceability (structure)|serviceability]], ''at'' and ''after'' a particular earthquake exposure. A structure is normally considered ''safe'' if it does not endanger the lives and [[well-being]] of those in or around it by partially or completely collapsing. A structure may be considered ''serviceable'' if it is able to fulfill its operational functions for which it was designed.

Basic concepts of the earthquake engineering, implemented in the major building codes, assume that a building should survive a rare, very severe earthquake by sustaining significant damage but without globally collapsing.&lt;ref name=RecommendedLateralForce&gt;{{cite book|title= Recommended Lateral Force Requirements and Commentary|author=Seismology Committee|year=1999|publisher= Structural Engineers Association of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it should remain operational for more frequent, but less severe seismic events.

=== Seismic performance assessment ===

Engineers need to know the quantified level of the actual or anticipated seismic performance associated with the direct damage to an individual building subject to a specified ground shaking.
Such an assessment may be performed either experimentally or analytically.

==== Experimental assessment ====
Experimental evaluations are expensive tests that are typically done by placing a (scaled) model of the structure on a [[earthquake shaking table|shake-table]] that simulates the earth shaking and observing its behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=neesit |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc652Zp5qWk&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=182 |title=Shaking Table Test on Conventional Wooden House (1) |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-11-17 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such kinds of experiments were first performed more than a century ago.&lt;ref name=SeismicExperiments&gt;{{cite book|title= Seismic Experiments on the Fracturing and Overturning of Columns|author=Omori, F.|year=1900|publisher=Publ. Earthquake Invest. Comm. In Foreign Languages, N.4, Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only recently has it become possible to perform 1:1 scale testing on full structures.

Due to the costly nature of such tests, they tend to be used mainly for understanding the seismic behavior of structures, validating models and verifying analysis methods. Thus, once properly validated, computational models and numerical procedures tend to carry the major burden for the seismic performance assessment of structures.

==== Analytical/Numerical assessment ====
[[File:Shaking NDC.jpg|thumb|left|Snapshot from [[shake-table video]] of a 6-story non-ductile concrete building [[destructive testing]]]]

'''Seismic performance assessment''' or [[seismic analysis|seismic structural analysis]] is a powerful tool of earthquake engineering which utilizes detailed modelling of the structure together with methods of structural analysis to gain a better understanding of seismic performance of building and [[non-building structure]]s. The technique as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.

In general, seismic structural analysis is based on the methods of [[structural dynamics]].&lt;ref name=DynamicsOfStructures&gt;{{cite book|title= Dynamics of Structures|author=Chopra, Anil K.|year=1995|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-855214-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For decades, the most prominent instrument of seismic analysis has been the earthquake [[response spectrum]] method which also contributed to the proposed building code's concept of today.&lt;ref name=EarthquakeSpectra&gt;{{cite book|title= Earthquake Spectra and Design|author1=Newmark, N.M. |author2=Hall, W.J. |year=1982|publisher=[[Earthquake Engineering Research Institute|EERI]]|isbn=0-943198-22-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, such methods are good only for linear elastic systems, being largely unable to model the structural behavior when damage (i.e., [[non-linearity]]) appears. Numerical ''step-by-step integration'' proved to be a more effective method of analysis for multi-degree-of-freedom [[structural system]]s with significant [[non-linearity]] under a [[Transient (oscillation)|transient]] process of ground motion excitation.&lt;ref name=DynamicsofStructures&gt;{{cite book|title= Dynamics of Structures|author1=Clough, Ray W. |author2=Penzien, Joseph |year=1993|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-011394-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basically, numerical analysis is conducted in order to evaluate the seismic performance of buildings. Performance evaluations are generally carried out by using nonlinear static pushover analysis or  nonlinear time-history analysis. In such analyses, it is essential to achieve accurate non-linear modeling of structural components such as beams, columns, beam-column joints, shear walls etc. Thus, experimental results play an important role in determining the modeling parameters of individual components, especially those that are subject to significant non-linear deformations. The individual components are then assembled to create a full non-linear model of the structure. Thus created models are analyzed to evaluate the performance of buildings.

The capabilities of the structural analysis software are a major consideration in the above process as they restrict the possible component models, the analysis methods available and, most importantly, the numerical robustness. The latter becomes a major consideration for structures that venture into the non-linear range and approach global or local collapse as the numerical solution becomes increasingly unstable and thus difficult to reach. There are several commercially available Finite Element Analysis software's such as CSI-SAP2000 and CSI-PERFORM-3D and Scia Engineer-ECtools which can be used for the seismic performance evaluation of buildings. Moreover, there is research-based finite element analysis platforms such as [[OpenSees]], RUAUMOKO and the older DRAIN-2D/3D, several of which are now open source.

== Research for earthquake engineering ==
[[File:FPB testing-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Earthquake shaking table|Shake-table]] testing of [[Earthquake engineering#Friction pendulum bearing|Friction Pendulum Bearings]] at EERC]]

Research for earthquake engineering means both field and analytical investigation or experimentation intended for discovery and scientific explanation of earthquake engineering related facts, revision of conventional concepts in the light of new findings, and practical application of the developed theories.

The [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) is the main United States government agency that supports fundamental research and education in all fields of earthquake engineering. In particular, it focuses on experimental, analytical and computational research on design and performance enhancement of structural systems.[[File:E-Defense Shake Table.jpg|thumb|E-Defense Shake Table&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-mEDsqZK-I&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=660C7AFD70E81C12&amp;index=71 |title=Miki_house_test |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-07-02 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[Earthquake Engineering Research Institute]] (EERI) is a leader in dissemination of [[earthquake engineering research]] related information both in the U.S. and globally.

A definitive list of earthquake engineering research related [[Earthquake shaking table|shaking tables]] around the world may be found in Experimental Facilities for Earthquake Engineering Simulation Worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nea.fr/html/nsd/docs/2004/csni-r2004-10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The most prominent of them is now E-Defense Shake Table&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bosai.go.jp/hyogo/ehyogo/|title=The NIED ‘E-Defence’ Laboratory in Miki City]|accessdate=3 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Japan]].{{clear}}

[[File:Seismic Testing of Crane.jpg|thumb|left|NEES at [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|Buffalo]] testing facility]]

The equipment sites (labs) and a central data repository are connected to the global earthquake engineering community via the NEEShub website.  The NEES website is powered by HUBzero software developed at [[Purdue University]] for [[nanoHUB]] specifically to help the scientific community share resources and collaborate.  The cyberinfrastructure, connected via [[Internet2]], provides interactive simulation tools, a simulation tool development area, a curated central data repository, animated presentations, user support, telepresence, mechanism for uploading and sharing resources, and statistics about users and usage patterns.

This cyberinfrastructure allows researchers to: securely store, organize and share data within a standardized framework in a central location; remotely observe and participate in experiments through the use of synchronized real-time data and video; collaborate with colleagues to facilitate the planning, performance, analysis, and publication of research experiments; and conduct computational and hybrid simulations that may combine the results of multiple distributed experiments and link physical experiments with computer simulations to enable the investigation of overall system performance.

These resources jointly provide the means for collaboration and discovery to improve the seismic design and performance of civil and mechanical infrastructure systems.

=== Earthquake simulation ===

The very first '''earthquake simulations''' were performed by statically applying some ''horizontal inertia forces'' based on [[scale factor|scaled]] [[peak ground acceleration]]s to a mathematical model of a building.&lt;ref name=SeismicDesignOfBuildingStructures&gt;{{cite book|title= Seismic Design of Building Structures|author1=Lindeburg, Michael R. |author2=Baradar, Majid |year=2001|publisher=Professional Publications|isbn=1-888577-52-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the further development of computational technologies, [[statics|static]] approaches began to give way to [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] ones.

Dynamic experiments on building and non-building structures may be physical, like [[Earthquake shaking table|shake-table testing]], or virtual ones. In both cases, to verify a structure's expected seismic performance, some researchers prefer to deal with so called "real time-histories" though the last cannot be "real" for a hypothetical earthquake specified by either a building code or by some particular research requirements. Therefore, there is a strong incentive to engage an earthquake simulation which is the seismic input that possesses only essential features of a real event.

Sometimes earthquake simulation is understood as a re-creation of local effects of a strong earth shaking.

=== Structure simulation ===
[[File:Kinematically equivalent building models on a shake-table.jpg|thumb|Concurrent experiments with two building models which are ''kinematically equivalent'' to a real prototype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvD5D2uhliM |title=Base isolation for earthquake engineering |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Theoretical or experimental evaluation of anticipated seismic performance mostly requires a '''structure simulation''' which is based on the concept of structural likeness or similarity. [[Similitude (model)|Similarity]] is some degree of [[analogy]] or [[Nominalism|resemblance]] between two or more objects. The notion of similarity rests either on exact or approximate repetitions of [[patterns]] in the compared items.

In general, a building model is said to have similarity with the real object if the two share ''geometric similarity'', ''kinematic similarity'' and ''dynamic similarity''. The most vivid and effective type of similarity is the ''kinematic'' one. ''Kinematic similarity'' exists when the paths and velocities of moving particles of a model and its prototype are similar.

The ultimate level of ''kinematic similarity'' is ''kinematic equivalence'' when, in the case of earthquake engineering, time-histories of each story lateral displacements of the model and its prototype would be the same.

== Seismic vibration control ==

'''Seismic vibration control''' is a set of technical means aimed to mitigate seismic impacts in building and [[non-building]] structures. All seismic vibration control  devices may be classified as ''passive'', ''active'' or ''hybrid''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics-animations.com/Physics/English/spri_txt.htm |title=Passive and active vibration isolation systems – Theory |publisher=Physics-animations.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; where:

* ''passive control devices'' have no [[feedback]] capability between them, structural elements and the ground;
* ''[[Active vibration control|active control devices]]'' incorporate real-time recording instrumentation on the ground integrated with earthquake input processing equipment and [[actuator]]s within the structure;
* ''hybrid control devices'' have combined features of active and passive control systems.&lt;ref name=ActiveHybrid&gt;{{cite book|title= Active, Hybrid and Semi-Active Structural Control|author1=Chu, S.Y. |author2=Soong, T.T. |author3=Reinhorn, A.M. |year=2005|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=0-470-01352-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ground [[seismic waves]] reach up and start to penetrate a base of a building, their energy flow density, due to reflections, reduces dramatically: usually, up to 90%. However, the remaining portions of the incident waves during a major earthquake still bear a huge devastating potential.

After the seismic waves enter a [[superstructure]], there are a number of ways to control them in order to soothe their damaging effect and improve the building's seismic performance, for instance:

* to [[Dissipator (building design)|dissipate]] the wave energy inside a [[superstructure]] with properly engineered [[damper (mast)|damper]]s;
* to disperse the wave energy between a wider range of frequencies;
* to [[absorption (acoustics)|absorb]] the [[resonant]] portions of the whole wave frequencies band with the help of so-called ''[[mass damper]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/211_fall2002.web.dir/Eva_Burk/Eva's%201st%20page.htm |title=Slide 2 |publisher=Ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cyrus tomb.jpg|thumb|[[Mausoleum]] of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], the oldest [[base isolation|base-isolated]] structure in the world]]
Devices of the last kind, abbreviated correspondingly as TMD for the tuned (''passive''), as AMD for the ''active'', and as HMD for the ''hybrid mass dampers'', have been studied and installed in [[high-rise building]]s, predominantly in Japan, for a quarter of a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.takenaka.co.jp/takenaka_e/quake_e/seishin/seishin.htm|title=想いをかたちに 未来へつなぐ　竹中工務店|website=www.takenaka.co.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is quite another approach: partial suppression of the seismic energy flow into the [[superstructure]] known as seismic or [[base isolation]].

For this, some pads are inserted into or under all major load-carrying elements in the base of the building which should substantially decouple a [[superstructure]] from its [[Substructure (engineering)|substructure]] resting on a shaking ground.

The first evidence of earthquake protection by using the principle of base isolation was discovered in [[Pasargadae]], a city in ancient Persia, now Iran, and dates back to the 6th century BCE. Below, there are some samples of seismic vibration control technologies of today.

=== Dry-stone walls control ===
[[File:Machupicchu intihuatana.JPG|thumb|left|Dry-stone walls of [[Machu Picchu]] Temple of the Sun, [[Peru]]]]People of [[Inca civilization]] were masters of the polished 'dry-stone walls', called [[ashlar]], where blocks of stone were cut to fit together tightly without any [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. The Incas were among the best stonemasons the world has ever seen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/inca1/qanda.html |title=Live Event Q&amp;As |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many junctions in their masonry were so perfect that even blades of grass could not fit between the stones.

[[Peru]] is a highly [[seismic]] land and for centuries the mortar-free [[construction]] proved to be apparently more earthquake-resistant than using mortar. The stones of the dry-stone walls built by the Incas could move slightly and resettle without the walls collapsing, a passive [[vibration control|structural control]] technique employing both the principle of energy dissipation (coulomb damping) and that of suppressing [[resonant]] amplifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/easter/civilization/first.html |title=Clark, Liesl; "First Inhabitants"; PBS online, Nova; updated Nov. 2000 |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tuned mass damper ===
{{Main article|Tuned mass damper}}
[[File:Taipei 101 Tuned Mass Damper.png|thumb|left|[[Tuned mass damper]] in [[Taipei 101]], the world's third tallest [[skyscraper]]]]

Typically the [[tuned mass damper]]s are huge concrete blocks mounted in [[skyscraper]]s or other structures and move in opposition to the [[resonance frequency]] oscillations of the structures by means of some sort of spring mechanism.

The [[Taipei 101]] skyscraper needs to withstand [[typhoon]] winds and earthquake [[tremor]]s common in this area of Asia/Pacific. For this purpose, a steel [[pendulum]] weighing 660 metric tonnes that serves as a tuned mass damper was designed and installed atop the structure. Suspended from the 92nd to the 88th floor, the pendulum sways to decrease resonant amplifications of lateral displacements in the building caused by earthquakes and strong [[Wind|gusts]].

=== Hysteretic dampers ===
A '''hysteretic damper''' is intended to provide better and more reliable seismic performance than that of a conventional structure by increasing the dissipation of [[seismic loading|seismic input]] energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.structuremag.org/OldArchives/2004/july/Structural%20Practices.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514012858/http://www.structuremag.org/OldArchives/2004/july/Structural%20Practices.pdf |date=May 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are five major groups of hysteretic dampers used for the purpose, namely:

:* '''Fluid viscous dampers (FVDs)'''
Viscous Dampers have the benefit of being a supplemental damping system. They have an oval hysteretic loop and the damping is velocity dependent. While some minor maintenance is potentially required, viscous dampers generally do not need to be replaced after an earthquake. While more expensive than other damping technologies they can be used for both seismic and wind loads and are the most commonly used hysteretic damper.

:* '''Friction dampers (FDs)'''
Friction dampers tend to be available in two major types, linear and rotational and dissipate energy by heat. The damper operates on the principle of a [[Coulomb damping|coulomb damper]]. Depending on the design, friction dampers can experience [[stick-slip phenomenon]] and [[Cold welding]]. The main disadvantage being that friction surfaces can wear over time and for this reason they are not recommended for dissipating wind loads. When used in seismic applications wear is not a problem and there is no required maintenance. They have a rectangular hysteretic loop and as long as the building is sufficiently elastic they tend to settle back to their original positions after an earthquake.

:* '''Metallic yielding dampers (MYDs)'''
Metallic yielding dampers, as the name implies, yield in order to absorb the earthquake's energy. This type of damper absorbs a large amount of energy however they must be replaced after an earthquake and may prevent the building from settling back to its original position.

:* '''Viscoelastic dampers (VEDs)'''
Viscoelastic dampers are useful in that they can be used for both wind and seismic applications, they are usually limited to small displacements. There is some concern as to the reliability of the technology as some brands have been banned from use in buildings in the United States.

:* '''Straddling pendulum dampers (swing)'''

=== Base isolation ===
Base isolation seeks to prevent the kinetic energy of the earthquake from being transferred into elastic energy in the building. These technologies do so by isolating the structure from the ground, thus enabling them to move somewhat independently. The degree to which the energy is transferred into the structure and how the energy is dissipated will vary depending on the technology used.

:* '''Lead rubber bearing'''
[[File:LRBtest.jpg|thumb|LRB being tested at the [[UCSD]] Caltrans-SRMD facility]]

Lead rubber bearing or LRB is a type of [[base isolation]] employing a heavy [[damping]].  It was invented by [[William Robinson (scientist)|Bill Robinson]], a New Zealander.&lt;ref name="teara.govt.nz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/earthquakes/4 |title=4. Building for earthquake resistance – Earthquakes – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Teara.govt.nz |date=2009-03-02 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy damping mechanism incorporated in [[vibration control]] technologies and, particularly, in base isolation devices, is often considered a valuable source of suppressing vibrations thus enhancing a building's seismic performance. However, for the rather pliant systems such as base isolated structures, with a relatively low bearing stiffness but with a high damping, the so-called "damping force" may turn out the main pushing force at a strong earthquake.  The video&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=neesit |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yXgu4aS8HE |title=LBRtest |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-07-10 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows a Lead Rubber Bearing being tested at the [[UCSD]] Caltrans-SRMD facility. The bearing is made of rubber with a lead core. It was a uniaxial test in which the bearing was also under a full structure load. Many buildings and bridges, both in New Zealand and elsewhere, are protected with lead dampers and lead and rubber bearings. [[Te Papa Tongarewa]], the national museum of New Zealand, and the New Zealand [[The Beehive|Parliament Buildings]] have been fitted with the bearings. Both are in [[Wellington, New Zealand|Wellington]] which sits on an [[active fault]].&lt;ref name="teara.govt.nz"/&gt;

:* '''Springs-with-damper base isolator'''
[[File:GERB spring with damper.jpg|thumb|Springs-with-damper close-up]]

Springs-with-damper base isolator installed under a three-story town-house, [[Santa Monica]], California is shown on the photo taken prior to the 1994 [[Northridge earthquake]] exposure. It is a [[base isolation]] device conceptually similar to ''Lead Rubber Bearing''.

One of two three-story town-houses like this, which was well instrumented for recording of both vertical and horizontal [[acceleration]]s on its floors and the ground, has survived a severe shaking during the [[Northridge earthquake]] and left  valuable recorded information for further study.

:* '''Simple roller bearing'''
Simple roller bearing is a [[base isolation]] device which is intended for protection of various building and non-building structures against potentially damaging [[seismic loading|lateral impacts]] of strong earthquakes.

This metallic bearing support may be adapted, with certain precautions, as a seismic isolator to skyscrapers and buildings on soft ground. Recently, it has been employed under the name of ''[[metallic roller bearing]]'' for a housing complex (17 stories) in [[Tokyo, Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okumuragumi.co.jp/en/technology/building.html |title=Building Technology + Seismic Isolation System – Okumura Corporation |language=ja |publisher=Okumuragumi.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* '''Friction pendulum bearing'''

Friction pendulum bearing (FPB) is another name of '''friction pendulum system''' (FPS). It is based on three pillars:&lt;ref name=FPS&gt;{{Citation |title=A Simple Pendulum Technique for Achieving Seismic Isolation |last1=Zayas |first1=Victor A. |last2=Low |first2=Stanley S. |last3=Mahin |first3=Stephen A. | author3-link=Stephen A.

== Seismic design ==

'''Seismic design''' is based on authorized engineering procedures, principles and criteria meant to [[design]] or [[seismic retrofit|retrofit]] structures subject to earthquake exposure.&lt;ref name=SeismicDesignOfBuildingStructures/&gt; Those criteria are only consistent with the contemporary state of the knowledge about [[earthquake engineering structures]].&lt;ref name=EarthquakeDesignCriteria&gt;{{cite book|title= Earthquake Design Criteria|author1=Housner, George W. |author2=Jennings, Paul C. |year=1982|publisher=EERI|isbn=1-888577-52-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a building design which exactly follows seismic code regulations does not guarantee safety against collapse or serious damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nisee.berkeley.edu/bertero/html/earthquake-resistant_construction.html |title=Earthquake-Resistant Construction |publisher=Nisee.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915091405/http://nisee.berkeley.edu/bertero/html/earthquake-resistant_construction.html |archivedate=2012-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The price of poor seismic design may be enormous. Nevertheless, seismic design has always been a [[trial and error]] process whether it was based on physical laws or on empirical knowledge of the [[seismic performance|structural performance]] of different shapes and materials.

[[File:San Francisco in ruins view from Captive Airship above Folsom 1906.jpg|thumb|[[San Francisco]] after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]] and fire]]
To practice [[seismic design]], seismic analysis or seismic evaluation of new and existing civil engineering projects, an [[engineer]] should, normally, pass examination on ''Seismic Principles''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pels.ca.gov/applicants/plan_civseism.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which, in the State of California, include:
* Seismic Data and Seismic Design Criteria
* Seismic Characteristics of Engineered Systems
* Seismic Forces
* Seismic Analysis Procedures
* Seismic Detailing and Construction Quality Control

To build up complex structural systems,&lt;ref name=SeismicDesignHandbook&gt;{{cite book|title=Seismic Design Handbook|author=Edited by Farzad Naeim|year=1989|publisher=VNR|isbn=0-442-26922-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; seismic design largely uses the same relatively small number of basic structural elements (to say nothing of vibration control devices) as any non-seismic design project.

Normally, according to building codes, structures are designed to "withstand" the largest earthquake of a certain probability that is likely to occur at their location. This means the loss of life should be minimized by preventing collapse of the buildings.

Seismic design is carried out by understanding the possible [[failure mode]]s of a structure and providing the structure with appropriate [[Strength of materials|strength]], [[stiffness]], [[ductility]], and [[configuration (geometry)|configuration]]&lt;ref name=BuildingConfiguration&gt;{{cite book|title= Building Configuration &amp; Seismic Design|author1=Arnold, Christopher |author2=Reitherman, Robert |year=1982|publisher=A Wiley-Interscience Publication|isbn=0-471-86138-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure those modes cannot occur.

=== Seismic design requirements ===
'''Seismic design requirements''' depend on the type of the structure, locality of the project and its authorities which stipulate applicable seismic design codes and criteria.&lt;ref name="RecommendedLateralForce"/&gt; For instance, [[California Department of Transportation]]'s requirements called ''The Seismic Design Criteria'' (SDC) and aimed at the design of new bridges in California&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/earthquake_engineering/SDC/SDCPage.html |title=Template for External Caltrans Pages |publisher=Dot.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporate an innovative seismic performance-based approach.

[[File:Metsamor aerien.jpg|thumb|The [[Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant]] was closed after the [[1988 Armenian earthquake]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asbarez.com/2007/12/07/strategy-to-close-metsamor-plant-presented |title=Strategy to Close Metsamor Plant Presented &amp;#124; Asbarez Armenian News |publisher=Asbarez.com |date=1995-10-26 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]The most significant feature in the SDC design philosophy is a shift from a ''force-based assessment'' of seismic demand to a ''displacement-based assessment'' of demand and capacity. Thus, the newly adopted displacement approach is based on comparing the ''elastic displacement'' demand to the ''inelastic displacement'' capacity of the primary structural components while ensuring a minimum level of inelastic capacity at all potential plastic hinge locations.

In addition to the designed structure itself, seismic design requirements may include a ''ground stabilization'' underneath the structure: sometimes, heavily shaken ground breaks up which leads to collapse of the structure sitting upon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=neesit |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d316Wdgf16Y&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=63 |title=Niigita Earthquake 1964 – YouTube |publisher=www.youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The following topics should be of primary concerns: liquefaction; dynamic lateral earth pressures on retaining walls; seismic slope stability; earthquake-induced settlement.&lt;ref name=GeoEarthquakeEngineering&gt;{{cite book|title= Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering Handbook|author=Robert W. Day|year=2007|publisher= McGraw Hill|isbn=0-07-137782-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nuclear facility|Nuclear facilities]] should not jeopardise their safety in case of earthquakes or other hostile external events. Therefore, their seismic design is based on criteria far more stringent than those applying to non-nuclear facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf18.html |title=Nuclear Power Plants and Earthquakes |publisher=World-nuclear.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] and [[2011 Japanese nuclear incidents|damage to other nuclear facilities]] that followed the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] have, however, drawn attention to ongoing concerns over [[Nuclear power in Japan#Seismicity|Japanese nuclear seismic design standards]] and caused other many governments to [[International reaction to Fukushima I nuclear accidents#Re-evaluation of existing nuclear energy programs|re-evaluate their nuclear programs]]. Doubt has also been expressed over the seismic evaluation and design of certain other plants, including the [[Fessenheim Nuclear Power Plant]] in France.

=== Failure modes ===

'''Failure mode''' is the manner by which an earthquake induced failure is observed. It, generally, describes the way the failure occurs. Though costly and time consuming, learning from each real earthquake failure remains a routine recipe for advancement in ''seismic design'' methods. Below, some typical modes of earthquake-generated failures are presented.

[[File:LomaPrieta-SOMA.jpeg|thumb|left|Typical damage to [[unreinforced masonry building]]s at earthquakes]]
The lack of [[rebar|reinforcement]] coupled with poor [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and inadequate roof-to-wall ties can result in substantial damage to an '''unreinforced masonry building'''. Severely cracked or leaning walls are some of the most common earthquake damage. Also hazardous is the damage that may occur between the walls and roof or floor diaphragms. Separation between the framing and the walls can jeopardize the vertical support of roof and floor systems.

[[File:LomaPrieta-Marina.jpeg|thumb|[[Soft story building|Soft story]] collapse due to inadequate shear strength at ground level, [[Loma Prieta earthquake]]]]
'''[[Soft story building|Soft story effect]]'''. Absence of adequate stiffness on the ground level caused damage to this structure. A close examination of the image reveals that the rough board siding, once covered by a [[brick veneer]], has been completely dismantled from the studwall. Only the [[Structural rigidity|rigidity]] of the floor above combined with the support on the two hidden sides by continuous walls, not penetrated with large doors as on the street sides, is preventing full collapse of the structure.

[[File:Liquefaction at Niigata.JPG|thumb|left|Effects of [[soil liquefaction]] during the [[1964 Niigata earthquake]]]]
'''[[Soil liquefaction]]'''. In the cases where the soil consists of loose granular deposited materials with the tendency to develop excessive hydrostatic pore water pressure of sufficient magnitude and compact, [[liquefaction]] of those loose saturated deposits may result in non-uniform [[Consolidation (soil)|settlements]] and tilting of structures. This caused major damage to thousands of buildings in Niigata, Japan during the [[1964 Niigata earthquake|1964 earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=neesit |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d316Wdgf16Y&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=63 |title=Niigita Earthquake 1964 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Smashed Car in Dujiangyan - 2008 Sichuan earthquake (1).jpg|thumb|Car smashed by [[landslide]] rock, [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]]]]
'''Landslide rock fall'''. A [[landslide]] is a geological phenomenon which includes a wide range of ground movement, including '''rock falls'''. Typically, the action of [[gravity]] is the primary driving force for a landslide to occur though in this case there was another contributing factor which affected the original [[slope stability]]: the landslide required an ''earthquake trigger'' before being released.

[[File:St.Joseph'sSeminary Los Altos USGS.jpg|thumb|left|Effects of pounding against adjacent building, [[Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta]]]]
'''Pounding against adjacent building'''. This is a photograph of the collapsed five-story tower, St. Joseph's Seminary, [[Los Altos, California]] which resulted in one fatality. During [[Loma Prieta earthquake]], the tower pounded against the independently vibrating adjacent building behind. A possibility of pounding depends on both buildings' lateral displacements which should be accurately estimated and accounted for.

[[File:Kaiser Permanente Building After Northridge Earthquake.jpg|thumb|Effects of completely shattered joints of concrete frame, [[Northridge earthquake|Northridge]]]]
At [[Northridge earthquake]], the Kaiser Permanente concrete frame office building had joints completely shattered, revealing '''inadequate confinement steel''', which resulted in the second story collapse. In the transverse direction, composite end [[shear wall]]s, consisting of two [[wythe]]s of brick and a layer of [[shotcrete]] that carried the lateral load, peeled apart because of '''inadequate through-ties''' and failed.

* Improper [[construction site]] on a [[foothill]].
* Poor detailing of the [[rebar|reinforcement]] (lack of concrete confinement in the columns and at the beam-column joints, inadequate splice length).
* Seismically weak [[soft story building|soft story]] at the first floor.
* Long [[cantilever]]s with heavy [[dead load]].

[[File:Ground failure.jpeg|thumb|''Lateral spreading'' mode of ground failure, [[Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta]]]]
Ground shaking triggered [[soil liquefaction]] in a subsurface layer of [[sand]], producing differential lateral and vertical movement in an overlying [[carapace]] of unliquified sand and [[silt]]. This '''mode of ground failure''', termed '''lateral spreading''', is a principal cause of liquefaction-related earthquake damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlSuosOTAV0&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=660C7AFD70E81C12&amp;index=53&amp;playnext=2&amp;playnext_from=PL |title=Soil Liquefaction with Dr. Ellen Rathje |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earthquake-resistant construction ==

'''Earthquake construction''' means implementation of '''seismic design''' to enable building and non-building structures to live through the anticipated earthquake exposure up to the expectations and in compliance with the applicable [[building code]]s.[[File:2009 03 03 Pearl River Tower.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of [[Pearl River Tower]] X-bracing to resist lateral forces of earthquakes and winds]]

Design and construction are intimately related. To achieve a good workmanship, detailing of the members and their connections should be as simple as possible. As any construction in general, earthquake construction is a process that consists of the building, retrofitting or assembling of infrastructure given the construction materials available.&lt;ref name=BridgeDesign&gt;{{cite book|title=Bridge Design, Construction and Maintenance
|author=Edited by Robert Lark|year=2007|publisher=Thomas Telford|isbn=0-7277-3593-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The destabilizing action of an earthquake on constructions may be ''direct'' (seismic motion of the ground) or ''indirect'' (earthquake-induced landslides, [[soil liquefaction]] and waves of tsunami).

A structure might have all the appearances of stability, yet offer nothing but danger when an earthquake occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24993357/ |title=Bad construction cited in quake zone – World news – Asia-Pacific – China earthquake &amp;#124; NBC News |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crucial fact is that, for safety, earthquake-resistant construction techniques are as important as [[quality control]] and using correct materials. ''Earthquake contractor'' should be [[registered company|registered]] in the state/province/country of the project location (depending on local regulations), [[bond (finance)|bonded]] and [[insured]] {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}.

To minimize possible [[earthquake loss|losses]], construction process should be organized with keeping in mind that earthquake may strike any time prior to the end of construction.

Each [[construction project]] requires a qualified team of professionals who understand the basic features of seismic performance of different structures as well as [[construction management]].

=== Adobe structures ===
[[File:Adobe structure.jpg|thumb|Partially collapsed adobe building in Westmorland, [[California]]]]

Around thirty percent of the world's population lives or works in earth-made construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eartharchitecture.org/|title=Earth Architecture – the Book, Synopsis|accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adobe]] type of [[mud brick]]s is one of the oldest and most widely used building materials. The use of [[adobe]] is very common in some of the world's most hazard-prone regions, traditionally across Latin America, Africa, Indian subcontinent and other parts of Asia, Middle East and Southern Europe.

Adobe buildings are considered very vulnerable at strong quakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOiqGHEOmuA&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=16 |title=simulacion terremoto peru-huaraz – casas de adobe – YouTube |publisher=Nz.youtube.com |date=2006-06-24 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, multiple ways of seismic strengthening of new and existing adobe buildings are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-housing.net/uploads/WHETutorial_Adobe_English.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828211041/http://www.world-housing.net/uploads/WHETutorial_Adobe_English.pdf |date=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key factors for the improved seismic performance of
adobe construction are:
* Quality of construction.
* Compact, box-type layout.
* Seismic reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EUOPY0OjlQ&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=21 |title=Shake table testing of adobe house (4A-S7 East) – YouTube |publisher=Nz.youtube.com |date=2007-01-12 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limestone and sandstone structures ===
[[File:SLCCityAndCountyBldg.jpg|thumb|left|Base-isolated City and County Building, [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]]]

[[Limestone]] is very common in architecture, especially in North America and Europe. Many landmarks across the world are made of limestone. Many medieval churches and castles in Europe are made of [[limestone]] and [[sandstone]] masonry. They are the long-lasting materials but their rather heavy weight is not beneficial for adequate seismic performance.

Application of modern technology to seismic retrofitting can enhance the survivability of unreinforced masonry structures. As an example, from 1973 to 1989, the [[Salt Lake City and County Building]] in [[Utah]] was exhaustively renovated and repaired with an emphasis on preserving historical accuracy in appearance. This was done in concert with a seismic upgrade that placed the weak sandstone structure on base isolation foundation to better protect it from earthquake damage.

=== Timber frame structures ===

[[Timber framing]] dates back thousands of years, and has been used in many parts of the world during various periods such as ancient Japan, Europe and medieval England in localities where timber was in good supply and building stone and the skills to work it were not.

The use of [[timber framing]] in buildings provides their complete skeletal framing which offers some structural benefits as the timber frame, if properly engineered, lends itself to better ''seismic survivability''.&lt;ref name=Timber&gt;{{cite book|title= Timber Design &amp; Construction Sourcebook=Gotz, Karl-Heinz et al.|year=1989|publisher=McGraw-Hall |isbn=0-07-023851-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Light-frame structures ===
[[File:Wood-framed house.jpg|thumb|left|A two-story wooden-frame for a residential building structure]]

[[Light-frame construction|Light-frame structures]] usually gain seismic resistance from rigid [[plywood]] shear walls and wood structural panel [[diaphragm (structural system)|diaphragms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nees.buffalo.edu/projects/NEESWood/video.asp |title=SEESL |publisher=Nees.buffalo.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special provisions for seismic load-resisting systems for all [[engineered wood]] structures requires consideration of diaphragm ratios, horizontal and vertical diaphragm shears, and [[Gender of connectors and fasteners|connector]]/[[fastener]] values. In addition, collectors, or drag struts, to distribute shear along a diaphragm length are required.

=== Reinforced masonry structures ===
[[File:Bond-beam.JPG|thumb|Reinforced hollow masonry wall]]

A construction system where [[steel reinforcement]] is embedded in the [[mortar joint]]s of [[masonry]] or placed in holes and after filled with [[concrete]] or [[grout]] is called '''reinforced masonry'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rossen Rashkoff |url=http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/earthquakes/MasonryBrick/ReinforcedBrickMasonry.htm |title=Reinforced Brick Masonry |publisher=Staff.city.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819014216/http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/earthquakes/MasonryBrick/ReinforcedBrickMasonry.htm |archivedate=2013-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The devastating [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]] revealed that masonry construction should be improved immediately. Then, the California State Code made the reinforced masonry mandatory.

There are various practices and techniques to achieve reinforced masonry. The most common type is the reinforced hollow unit masonry. The effectiveness of both vertical and horizontal reinforcement strongly depends on the type and quality of the masonry, i.e. masonry units and [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]].

To achieve a [[ductile]] behavior of masonry, it is necessary that the [[shear strength]] of the wall is greater than the [[flexural strength]].&lt;ref name=SeismicMasonry&gt;{{cite book|title= Seismic Design of Masonry Using the 1997 UBC|author1=Ekwueme, Chukwuma G. |author2=Uzarski, Joe |year=2003|publisher=Concrete Masonry Association of California and Nevada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reinforced concrete structures ===
[[File:StressedRibbonBridgeUnderside7138.JPG|thumb|left|Stressed Ribbon pedestrian bridge over the Rogue River, Grants Pass, [[Oregon]]]]
[[File:ThreeTwrBrCenter.jpg|thumb|left|Prestressed concrete [[cable-stayed bridge]] over [[Yangtze river]]]]

[[Reinforced concrete]] is concrete in which steel reinforcement bars ([[rebars]]) or [[fiber]]s have been incorporated to strengthen a material that would otherwise be [[brittle]]. It can be used to produce [[Beam (structure)|beams]], [[column]]s, floors or bridges.

[[Prestressed concrete]] is a kind of [[reinforced concrete]] used for overcoming concrete's natural weakness in tension. It can be applied to [[beams]], floors or bridges with a longer span than is practical with ordinary reinforced concrete. Prestressing [[tendon]]s (generally of high tensile steel cable or rods) are used to provide a clamping load which produces a [[compressive stress]] that offsets the [[tensile stress]] that the concrete [[compression member]] would, otherwise, experience due to a bending load.

To prevent catastrophic collapse in response earth shaking (in the interest of life safety), a traditional reinforced concrete frame should have [[ductile]] joints. Depending upon the methods used and the imposed seismic forces, such buildings may be immediately usable, require extensive repair, or may have to be demolished.

=== Prestressed structures ===
[[Prestressed structure]] is the one whose overall [[integrity]], [[Structural stability|stability]] and [[security]] depend, primarily, on a ''prestressing''. ''Prestressing'' means the intentional creation of permanent stresses in a structure for the purpose of improving its performance under various service conditions.&lt;ref name=PrestressedConcreteDesign&gt;{{cite book|title= Design of Prestressed Concrete|author=Nilson, Arthur H.|year=1987|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-83072-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roman Colosseum With Moon.jpg|thumb|Naturally pre-compressed exterior wall of [[Colosseum]], Rome]]
There are the following basic types of prestressing:
* Pre-compression (mostly, with the own weight of a structure)
* [[Prestressed concrete|Pretensioning]] with high-strength embedded tendons
* [[Prestressed concrete|Post-tensioning]] with high-strength bonded or unbonded tendons
Today, the concept of [[prestressed structure]] is widely engaged in design of [[building]]s, underground structures, TV towers, power stations, floating storage and offshore facilities, [[nuclear reactor]] vessels, and numerous kinds of [[bridge]] systems.&lt;ref name=PrestressedConcrete&gt;{{cite book|title= Prestressed Concrete|author=Nawy, Edward G.|year=1989|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-698375-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A beneficial idea of ''prestressing'' was, apparently, familiar to the ancient Rome architects; look, e.g., at the tall [[attic]] wall of [[Colosseum]] working as a stabilizing device for the wall [[pier]]s beneath.

=== Steel structures ===
[[File:LomaPrieta-BayBridge-collapsed-section.jpeg|thumb|Collapsed section of the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]] in response to [[Loma Prieta earthquake]]]]

'''Steel structures''' are considered mostly earthquake resistant but some failures have occurred. A great number of welded [[steel moment-resisting frame]] buildings, which looked earthquake-proof, surprisingly experienced brittle behavior and were hazardously damaged in the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]].&lt;ref name=Reitherman&gt;{{cite book|last=Reitherman|first=Robert|title=Earthquakes and Engineers: An International History|year=2012|publisher=ASCE Press|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784410714|pages=394–395|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&amp;productid=154097877|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726183407/http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&amp;productid=154097877|archivedate=2012-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) initiated development of repair techniques and new design approaches to minimize damage to steel moment frame buildings in future earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacsteel.org/index.html |title=SAC Steel Project: Welcome |publisher=Sacsteel.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[structural steel]] seismic design based on [[Load and Resistance Factor Design]] (LRFD) approach, it is very important to assess ability of a structure to develop and maintain its bearing resistance in the [[inelastic]] range. A measure of this ability is [[ductility]], which may be observed in a ''material itself'', in a ''structural element'', or to a ''whole structure''.

As a consequence of [[Northridge earthquake]] experience, the American Institute of Steel Construction has introduced AISC 358 "Pre-Qualified Connections for Special and intermediate Steel Moment Frames."  The AISC Seismic Design Provisions require that all [[Steel Moment Resisting Frame]]s employ either connections contained in AISC 358, or the use of connections that have been subjected to pre-qualifying cyclic testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seismic Design Manual|year=2006|publisher=American Institute of Steel Construction|location=Chicago|isbn=1-56424-056-8|pages=6.1–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prediction of earthquake losses ==

'''Earthquake loss estimation''' is usually defined as a ''Damage Ratio'' ('''DR''') which is a ratio of the earthquake damage repair cost to the [[Total Economic Value|total value]] of a building.&lt;ref name=SeismicRisk&gt;{{cite book|title= Financial Management of Earthquake Risk|author=EERI Endowment Subcommittee|date=May 2000|publisher=EERI Publication|isbn=0-943198-21-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Probable Maximum Loss'' ('''PML''') is a common term used for earthquake loss estimation, but it lacks a precise definition.  In 1999, ASTM E2026 'Standard Guide for the Estimation of Building Damageability in Earthquakes' was produced in order to standardize the nomenclature for seismic loss estimation, as well as establish guidelines as to the review process and qualifications of the reviewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cccengr.com/cccengerwebpage_lossestimation.html|year=1999|title=Loss Estimation|author=Eugene Trahern|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410060435/http://www.cccengr.com/cccengerwebpage_lossestimation.html|archivedate=2009-04-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earthquake loss estimations are also referred to as ''Seismic Risk Assessments''.  The risk assessment process generally involves determining the probability of various ground motions coupled with the vulnerability or damage of the building under those ground motions.  The results are defined as a percent of building replacement value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Acceptable Risk Processes: Lifeline and Natural Hazards|year=2002|publisher=ASCE, TCLEE|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784406236|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147486137&amp;productid=5260|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130113010823/http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147486137&amp;productid=5260|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-13|editor1=Craig Taylor|editor2=Erik VanMarcke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5561">'''''The El Salvador Reconstruction and Development Project''''' is a charitable volunteer project from [[Imperial College|Imperial College London]]'s Department of [[Civil Engineering|Civil]] and [[Environmental Engineering]] which was launched in reaction to two major earthquakes that struck the country of [[El Salvador]] in 2001. The project has a voluntary student membership basis and is concentrated in rural, mainly underdeveloped areas of the country.

Team leadership and student involvement interchange on an annual basis with the start of a new academic year. The project is supported by a board of Alumni members.

==History==
{{main|2001 El Salvador earthquakes}}

As a result of the large magnitude [[earthquakes]] that killed at least 844 people,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rwarchive/rwb.nsf/db900sid/OCHA-64DFMC?OpenDocument ReliefWeb - El Salvador Earthquake: Emergency Update 02 Feb 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; students from Imperial College London's Civil Engineering Department volunteered to work on a development project from 2002 onwards, to be concentrated in the country's poorest communities over subsequent academic years.

Students from several universities and disciplines have travelled along to El Salvador and worked with the relevant community for 5 to 7 weeks on various development projects. The typical student intake over a particular year varies between 11-13.

Communities helped by the El Salvador Project: [[Estanzuelas]], [[Usulután]] (2002), [[San Emigdio]], [[La Paz Department (El Salvador)|La Paz]] (2003, 2004, 2005), [[Santa Marta]], [[San Vicente, El Salvador|San Vicente]] (2006, 2007), [[Colima]], [[Cuscatlán Department|Cuscatlán]] (2009)

==Finance==
[[Image:JPMorganGoodVenture2009.jpeg|thumb|300px|Winners of the [[JP Morgan]] Global Good Venture Competition 2009 in New York City: Adam Yang, Feroza Kassam, Raz Jabary, Mohammad Mahbub (l-r).]]

The project receives most of its finance from company sponsors. From the appointment of a particular year's members to the end of the relevant academic year the student body is further involved in [[fundraising]] events, which in the past has included evening sales and a marathon style run in the Netherlands.
On 17 April 2009 the project competed in the [[JP Morgan]] Good Venture Case competition in New York City, where it won $25,000 to fund its activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eurocareers.jpmorgan.com/student/jpmorgan/careers/goodventure JP Morgan - Good Venture Case Competition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713121904/http://eurocareers.jpmorgan.com/student/jpmorgan/careers/goodventure |date=2011-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 2009 the project secured a further $15,000 from JP Morgan's online global [https://web.archive.org/web/20100105161900/http://careers.jpmorgan.com/student/jpmorgan/careers/goodventure/gia Give-it-Away] competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eurocareers.jpmorgan.com/student/jpmorgan/careers/goodventure/gia JP Morgan - Give-it-Away Competition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330093609/http://eurocareers.jpmorgan.com/student/jpmorgan/careers/goodventure/gia |date=2010-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009 Project==
This year's project was based in the community of [[Colima]] in the Department of [[Cuscatlán]]. Two reinforced [[earthquake]] resistant houses were constructed, in addition to a [[retaining wall]]. The design of the houses was presented by the Reconstruction and Development Organization of El Salvador ([http://www.redes.org/ REDES]), a national NGO which works closely with the project and oversees the construction process.

==Future activities==
In association with the [[British people|British]] [[Geological]] Survey [[seismologists]] from among others the Department of Civil Engineering of Imperial College London predict an increasing risk posed by earthquakes in El Salvador in the near future due to rapid population expansion exacerbated by [[deforestation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsevier.com/locate/soildyn The El Salvador earthquakes of January and February 2001: context, characteristics and implications for seismic risk]&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the floods and landslides in November 2009 that left at least 192 people dead,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/world-news/192-dead-in-el-salvador-mudslides-1944239.html 192 dead in El Salvador mudslides]&lt;/ref&gt; REDES will likely be appointing a specifically badly struck geographical entity for consideration under the 2010 project.

Plans for future improvement that are currently awaiting approval include the expansion of a particular year's activities to cover more than one community, spreading out the construction work by sending over teams outside the summer term period and expansion of the concept of the project to cover communities in the neighbouring countries of [[Guatemala]] and [[Honduras]].

==2014 Project==
The 2014 project will involve the project team travelling to Guatemala for the first time. A house design developed in conjunction with Arup will be tested on an earthquake simulator at the [[Universidad Mariano Galvez|University Mariano Galvez]] in Guatemala City. The team will then construct a second house within a community in El Salvador.

In [[mechanical engineering]], an '''envelope''' is a solid representing all positions which may be occupied by an object during its normal range of motion.

Another (jargon) word for this is a "flop".

==Wheel envelope==
In [[automobile design]], a wheel envelope may be used to model all positions a [[wheel]] and [[tire]] combo may be expected to occupy during driving. This will take into account the maximum [[jounce]] and rebound allowed by the [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system and the maximum turn and tilt allowed by the [[steering]] mechanism. Minimum and maximum tire inflation pressures and wear conditions may also be considered when generating the envelope.

This envelope is then compared with the wheel housing and other components in the area to perform an interference/collision analysis.  The results of this analysis tell the engineers whether that wheel/tire combo will strike the housing and components under normal driving conditions.  If so, either a redesign is in order, or that wheel/tire combo will not be recommended.

A different wheel envelope must be generated for each wheel/tire combo for which the vehicle is rated.  Much of this analysis is done using [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]/[[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]] systems running on computers.  Of course, high speed collisions, during an accident, are not considered "normal driving conditions", so the wheel and tire may very well contact other parts of the vehicle at that time.

== Robot's working envelope ==
In robotics, the working envelope or work area is the volume of working or reaching space . Some factors of a robot's design (configurations, [[robotic axe|axe]]s or [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]]) influence its working envelope.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/otm_iv/otm_iv_4.html OSHA TECHNICAL MANUAL - SECTION IV: CHAPTER 4&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions''', (also known as ''European Union Survey on Income and Living Conditions'') abbreviated '''EU-SILC''', is a survey department of the [[EU]].
It replaced in 2004 the ''European Community Household Panel'' (ECHP), which covered the years 1994-2003. The EU-SILC includes only minor changes relative to its predecessor the ECHP; most importantly, it significantly expands the number of countries included in the sample.

On the proposal of [[Jules Vuillemin]], a chair in the department of Philosophy and History was created at [[Collège de France]] to replace the late [[Jean Hyppolite]]. The title of the new chair was ''The history of systems of thought'' and it was created on 30 November 1969. Vuillemin put forward the then-little known outside the shores of France-philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] - to the general assembly of professors and Foucault was duly elected on 12 April 1970. He was 44 years old. As required by this appointment he held a series of public lectures from 1970 until his death in 1984. These lectures in which he further advanced his work, were summarised from audio recordings and edited by Michel Senellart. They were subsequently translated into English and further edited by Graham Burchell and published posthumously by St Martin's Press.

==''Lectures On The Will To Know'' (1970–1971)==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2015}}
This was an important time for Foucault and marks an important switch of methodology from ‘archaeology’ to ‘genealogy’ (according to Foucault he never abandoned the archaeology method). This was also a period of transition of thought for Foucault; the Dutch TV-televised Foucault [[Noam Chomsky]] ''Human nature Justice versus Power debate'' of November 1971 at the Eindhoven University of Technology appears at this exact time period as his first inaugural lecture were delivered at the [[Collège de France]] entitled "the Order Of Discourse" delivered on 2 December 1970 (translated and published into English as "The Discourse On Language") then a week later (9 December 1970) his first ever full inaugural lecture course was delivered at the Collège de France "The Will to Knowledge" course Foucault promised to explore; "fragment by fragment," the "morphology of the will to knowledge," through alternating historical periods, inquiries and theoretical questioning. The lectures produced were called "Lectures On The Will To Know"; all of this within a space of a year.

The first phase of Foucault’s thought is characterized by knowledge construction of various types and how each thread of knowledge systems combine together to produce a series of networks (Foucault uses the term ‘Grille’) to produce a successful fully functional ‘subject’ and a workable fully functional human society. Foucault uses the terms ''[[epistemological]] indicators'' and ''epistemological breaks'' to show, contrary to popular opinion, that these "indicators" and "breaks" require skilled trained technical group of ‘specialists’ in the various knowledge fields and a trained rigorous professionalized regulatory body of which know-how on behalf of those who use the terms (discourse formations or "speech/discourse") with a professional body that can make the terms used stand up to further rational scrutiny. Scientific knowledge for Foucault isn’t an advancement for human progress as is so often portrayed by the human sciences (such as the humanities and the social sciences) but is much more of a subtle method of organizing and producing firstly an individual subject, and secondly, a fully functional society functioning as a self-replicated control apparatus not as a group of ‘free’ atomized individuals but as a collective societal, organised (or drilled) unit both in terms of industrial [[Economics|Production]], [[labour power]] and a militarily organized unit (in the guise of armies) which is beneficial for the production of "epistemological indicators" or "breaks" enabling society to "control itself" rather than have external factors (such as the state for example) to do the job.

In the inaugural lecture course "The Will To Know" Foucault goes into detail on how the ‘natural order of things’ from the 16th century transpired into a fully organised human society which includes a "[[Governmentality]]" apparatus and a complex machine (by "governmentaility", Foucault means a state apparatus which is conceived as a scientific machine) as a rational organizing principle. This was the first time (contrary to popular opinion that this was a rather late invention in Foucault’s thought) that Foucault started to go into the Greek dimensions of his thought of which he would return to in later lectures towards the end of his life. First of all a few pointers should be made explicit on certain points. Foucault mentions the western notion of by [[money]], [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[trade]] (Greek society) starting about 800 BCE to 700 BCE. However, other ‘non-western’ societies also had these very same problems and is automatically assumed by some historians{{Who|date=July 2015}} that these were entirely western inventions. This isn’t entirely true; [[China]] and [[India]] for example had the most sophisticated trading and monetary institutions by the 6th century B.C.E., indeed the concept of a ''[[corporation]]'' existed in India&lt;ref&gt;[[Chanakya]] [[Arthashastra]] Translated by R Shamasastry pp. 541–547&lt;/ref&gt; from at least 800 BCE and lasted until at least 1000 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;"The examination reveals that business people on the Indian subcontinent utilized the corporate form from a very early period. The corporate form (e.g., the [[Shreni]]) was being used in India from at least 800 B.C., and perhaps even earlier, and was in more or less continuous
use since then until the advent of the Islamic invasions around 1000 A.D.
This provides evidence for the use of the corporate form centuries before the earliest Roman proto-corporations.
In fact, the use of the sreni in Ancient India was widespread including virtually
every kind of business, political and municipal activity. Moreover, when we examine how
these entities were structured, governed and regulated we find that they bear many
similarities to corporations and, indeed, to modern US corporations. The familiar concerns
of agency costs and incentive effects are both present and addressed in quite similar ways as
are many other aspects of the law regulating business entities. Further, examining the
historical development of the sreni indicates that the factors leading to the growth of this
corporate form are consistent with those put forward for the growth of organizational
entities in Europe. These factors include increasing trade, methods to contain agency costs,
and methods to patrol the boundaries between the assets of the sreni and those of its
members (i.e., to facilitate asset partitioning and reduce creditor information costs)." Vikramaditya S. Khanna ''The Economic History Of The Corporate Form In Ancient India 2005''&lt;/ref&gt;
Most importantly there was a [[social security]] system in India at this time. Foucault begins his notions from these lectures on the very notion of truth and the ‘Will to knowledge’ and the challenge is on when Foucault asks the very question of the entire western philosophical and political tradition: Namely knowledge (at least scientific knowledge) and its close association with truth is entirely desirable and is politically and philosophically natural and neutral. First of all Foucault puts these notions (at least its political notions) to a thorough test, firstly, Foucault asks the politically ‘neutral’ question on the very first appearance of money which became not only an important economic symbol but above all else became a measure of value and a unit of account.

Money once established as a social process and social reality had (if one could say the word) an extremely rocky and precarious history. First of all while it had a social reality but the actual social authority to use money didn’t develop a standard practice or knowledge on how to use it; it was rather undisciplined. Kings and emperors could squander large taxation revenues with impunity regardless of the consequences.They could default on repayments on loans as witnessed during the [[Hundred Years' War]] and During the [[Anglo-French War (1627–29)|Anglo-French War]] (1627-1629).&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Kaeuper ''Bankers to the Crown: The Riccardi of Lucca and Edward I''  1973&lt;/ref&gt; Above all else kings and monarchs could take out forced loans and get others(their subjects) to pay for these forced loans and to add insult to injury get them to pay interest on the loans at extortionate rates of interest charged on the loans because they and their advisers regarded it as their own ‘income’. However, whole societies were dependent on money particularly when the whole of society had to use and be ready for its function.&lt;ref&gt;Calendar Of Patent Rolls February 1255 pp. 400–401&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calendar Of Patent Rolls July 1255 pp. 439–440&lt;/ref&gt; Money took at least 3,000 years of history to get a more disciplined approach and became the sole prerogative of the fiscal responsibility of the state after the medieval ‘order of things’ was entirely dismantled ‘to get it right’ namely; the ruthlessness and rigorous efficiency needed for its proper function and it wasn’t until the 16th century with the advent of modern [[political economy]] with its analysis of production, [[Labour economics|labour]] and trade you then get a sense of why money, particularly its relationship with [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and its complex relationship with the rest of society conversion, from labour power into money via the essential route of [[surplus value]] became a much maligned and misunderstood category and hot potato. This is where Foucault is at his most profound. Foucault now is asking how is it that modern western political economy, together with [[political philosophy]] and [[political science]] came to ask the question concerning money but was utterly perplexed by it (this is a question that particularly irritated and irked [[Karl Marx]] throughout his life)? That money and its various association with production, labour, government and trade was beyond doubt but its exact relationship with the rest of society was entirely missed by economists but yet still its version of events was entirely accepted as true? Foucault begins to try to go into the whole production of truth (both philosophical and political) its whole “breaks” “discontinuity” 'epistemological unconscious' and theoretical splitting “[[Episteme]]”. From this Greek period starting from 800 BCE Foucault pursues the path of scientific and political knowledge the emergence and conditions of possibility for philosophical knowledge and ends up with “the problem of political knowledge (i.e. [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] notions of the political animal) of what is necessary in order to govern the city and put it right.” He then divided his work on the history of systems of thought into three interrelated parts, the “re-examination of knowledge, the conditions of knowledge, and the knowing subject.”

==''The Punitive Society'' (1972–1973)==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2015}}
In these lectures, published in English in 2015, Foucault uses the first precursor of [[Discipline and Punish]] to study the foundations of what he calls “disciplinary institutions”(punitive power) and the productive dimensions of penalty. Foucault spent a lot of time during this period trying to make intelligible the internal and external dynamics of what we call the prison. He questioned, "What are the relations of power which made possible the historical emergence of something like the prison?". This was correlated to three terms; firstly ‘measure’ "a means of establishing or restoring order, the right order, in the combat of men or the elements; but also a matrix of mathematical and physical knowledge."(treated in more detail in ''The Will To Knowledge'' lectures of 1971); Secondly the ‘inquiry’ "a means of establishing or restoring facts, events, actions, properties, rights; but also a matrix of empirical knowledge and natural sciences"(from the 1972 lectures ''Theories On Punishment and Penal Theories and Institutions'') and thirdly ‘the examination’ treated as "the permanent control of the individual, like a permanent test with no endpoint". Foucault links the examination with 18th century [[Political economy]] and the productive labourers with the wealth they produce and the forces of production.

==''"Society Must Be Defended"'' (1975–1976)==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2015}}
This series of lectures forms a trilogy with [[Security, Territory, Population]] and [[The Birth of Biopolitics]], and it contains Foucault's first discussion of [[biopower]]. It also contains an explanation of the term "Civil war" in the form of rigorous treatment of a working definition. Foucault goes into great detail how power (as Foucault saw it) becomes a battleground drifting from civil war to generalized pacification of the individual and particularly the systems he (the individual) relies upon and to which he gives loyalty: "According to this hypothesis, the role of political power is perpetually to use a sort of silent war to re-inscribe that relationship of force, and to re-inscribe it in institutions, economic inequalities, language, and even the bodies of individuals." Foucault begins to explain that this generalized form of power is not only rooted in [[Disciplinary institutions]] but is also concentrated in "political sovereignty, the military, and war," so it is in turn spread evenly throughout modern society as a network of domination.

Foucault then discusses what lies behind the “academic chestnut” which couldn't be deciphered by his historical predecessors: namely the disjointed and discontinuous movement of history and power (bio-power). What is meant by this? For Foucault's predecessors, history was concerned by deeds of monarchs and a full list of their accomplishments in which the sovereign is presented in the text as doing all things ‘great,’ added to this 'greatness' of deeds this 'greatness' of the sovereign was accomplished all by the sovereign himself without any help; monument building, allegedly built by the monarch, without any help from skilled and trained professionals serves as a perfectly good example of the sovereign "greatness". However, for Foucault, this is not the case. Foucault’s genealogy comes into play here where Foucault tries to build a bridge between two theoretical notions: disciplinary power ([[Disciplinary institutions]]) and biopower. He investigates the constant shift throughout history between these two ‘[[paradigms]],’ and what developments-from these two ‘paradigms’ became new subjects. The previous historical dimensions so often portrayed by historians Foucault argues, was sovereign history, which acts as a ceremonial tool for sovereign power "It glorifies and adds lustre to power. History performs this function in two modes: (1) in a "genealogical" mode (understood in the simple sense of that term) that traces the lineage of the sovereign. By the time of the 17th century with the development of [[Mercantilism]], [[Statistics]] ([[mathematical statistics]]) and [[political economy]] this reaches a most vitriolic and vicious form later to be called [[Nation states]] where whole populations were involved(in the guise of armies both industrial and military), in which a continuous war is enacted out not amongst ourselves(the population) but in a struggle for the state's very existence which ultimately leads to a "[[thanatopolitics]]"(a philosophical term that discusses the politics of organizing who should live and who should die (and how) in a given form of society) of the population on a large industrial scale.

This is where Foucault discusses a "counterhistory" of "race struggle or race war."According to Foucault Marx and Engels used or borrowed the term "Race" and transversed the term race into a new term called "[[Class struggle]]" which later [[Marxist]] accepted and began to use. This is more partly to do with Marx's antagonistic relationship with [[Karl Vogt]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marxists Internet Archive]]''  Karl Marx ''Herr Vogt'' 1860&lt;/ref&gt; who for his time was a convinced [[Polygenist]] which Marx and Engels had inherited Vogt's belief. Foucault quotes letters written by Marx to Engels in 1854 and [[Joseph Weydemeyer]] in 1852 {{cquote|Finally, in your place I should in general remark to the democratic gentlemen that they would do better first to acquaint themselves with bourgeois literature before they presume to yap at the opponents of it. For instance, these gentlemen should study the historical works of [[Augustin Thierry]], [[François Guizot]], [[John Wade (author)|John Wade]], and others in order to enlighten themselves as to the past 'history of classes.'Where the history of the revolutionary project and of revolutionary practice is indissoluble from this counterhistory of races&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''Society Must Be defended'' pp.79-80, p.85 1975-1976&lt;/ref&gt;}}.

Foucault challenges the traditional notions of racism in explaining the operation of the modern state. When Foucault talks of racism he is not talking about what we might traditionally understand it to be–an ideology, a mutual hatred. In Foucault’s reckoning modern racism is tied to power, making it something far more profound than traditionally assumed.&lt;ref name="Foucault"&gt;Foucault, M. (2003). Society must be defended: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1975–76, trans. David Macey. New York: Picador&lt;/ref&gt;
Tracing the genealogy of racism, Foucault proposes that ‘race’, previously used to describe the division between two opposing societal groups distinguished from one another for example by religion or language, came to be conceived in the late 18th century in biological terms. The concept of "race war" that referred to conflict over the legitimacy of the power of the established sovereign, was "reformulated" into a struggle for existence driven by concern about the biopolitical purity of the population as a single race that could be threatened from within its own body. For Foucault "racism is born at the point when the theme of racial purity replaces that of race struggle" (p.&amp;nbsp;81).&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt;

For Foucault, racism "is an expression of a schism within society…provoked by the idea of an ongoing and always incomplete cleaning of the social body…it structures social fields of action, guides political practice, and is realized through state apparatuses…it is concerned with biological purity and conformity with the norm" (pp.&amp;nbsp;43–44).&lt;ref name="Lemke"&gt;Lemke, T. (2011). Biopolitics. An Advanced Introduction. (Trans. E.F. Trump). New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In modern states, racism is not defined by the action of individuals, rather it is vested in the State and finds form in its structures and operation–it is State racism.

State racism serves two functions. Firstly, it makes it possible to divide the population into biological groups, "good and bad" or "superior or inferior" ‘races’. Fragmented into subspecies, the population can be brought under State control. Secondly, it facilitates a dynamic relationship between the life of one person and the death of another. Foucault is clear that this relationship is not one of warlike confrontation but rather a biological one, that is not based on the individual but rather on life in general "the more inferior species die out, the more abnormal individuals are eliminated the fewer degenerates there will be in the species as a whole, and the more I – as species rather than individual – can live, the stronger I will be, the more vigorous I will be, I will be able to proliferate" (p.&amp;nbsp;255)&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt;

In effect race, defined in biological terms, "furnished the ideological foundation for identifying, excluding, combating, and even murdering others, all in the name of improving life not of an individual but of life in general" (p.&amp;nbsp;42).&lt;ref name="Lemke" /&gt; What is important here is that racism, inscribed as one of the modern state’s basic techniques of power, allows enemies to be treated as threats, not political adversaries. But through what mechanism are these threats treated? Here the technologies of power described by Foucault become important.

Foucault argues that new technologies of power emerged in the second half of the 18th century, which Foucault termed biopolitics and biopower(Foucault uses both terms synonymously), these technologies focused on man-as-species and were concerned with optimising the state of life, with taking control of life and intervening to "make live and let die".&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt; Importantly, Foucault argues, the technologies did not replace the technologies of sovereign power with their exclusive focus on disciplining the individual body to be more productive by punishing or killing individuals, but embedded themselves into them. It was in exploring how this new power, with life as its object, could come to include the power to kill that Foucault theorizes the emergence of state racism.

Foucault argues that the modern state must at some point become involved with racism in order to function since once a State functions in a biopolitical mode it is racism alone that can justify killing.&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt;  Determined as a threat to the population, the State can take action to kill in the name of keeping the population safe and thriving, healthy and pure. It is racism that allows the right to kill to be squared off with a power that seeks to improve life. State racism delivers actions that while appearing to derive from altruistic intentions, veil the murder of the "Other"&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;Kelly, M. (2004). Racism, Nationalism and Biopolitics: Foucault’s Society Must Be Defended, 2003. Contretemps 4, September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Following this argument to its logical end, it is only when there is never a need for the State to claim the right to kill or to let die that State racism will disappear.

Since killing is predicated on racism it follows that the "most murderous states are also the most racist" (p.&amp;nbsp;258).&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt; Foucault refers to the way in which Nazism and the state socialism of the Soviet Union dealt with ethnic or social groups and their political adversaries as examples of this.

Threats, however, can change over time and here the utility of ‘race’ a concept comes into its own. While never defining ‘race’, Foucault suggests that the word ‘race’ is "not pinned to a stable biological meaning" (p.&amp;nbsp;77).&lt;ref name="Foucault"/&gt; with the implication that it is a concept that is socially and historically constructed where a discourse of truth is enabled. This makes ‘race’ something that is easy for the State to adopt and exploit for its own purpose. ‘Race’ becomes a technology that is used by the state to structure threats and to make decisions over the life and death of sub-populations. In this way it helps to explain how the idea of ‘race’ or cultural difference are used to wage wars such as the "war on terror" or the "humanitarian war" in East Timor.&lt;ref&gt;Fiaccadori, E.

== ''Security, Territory, Population'' (1977–1978)&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault  ''Lectures At The College de France Security, Territory, Population'' 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ==
{{Main article|Security, Territory, Population}}

The course deals with the genesis of a political knowledge that was to place at the centre of its concerns the notion of population and the mechanisms capable of ensuring its regulation but even of its procedures and means employed to ensure, in a given society, "the government of men". A transition from a "territorial state" to a "population state"([[Nation state]])?
Foucault examines the notion of [[biopolitics]] and [[biopower]] as a new technology of power over populations that is distinct from punitive disciplinary systems, by tracing the history of [[governmentality]], from the first centuries of the Christian era to the emergence of the modern nation state. These lectures illustrate a radical turning point in Foucault's work at which a shift to the problematic of the government of self and others occurred.

Foucault's challenge to himself in these series of lectures is to try and decipher the genealogical split between power in ancient and [[Medieval]] society and late modern society, such as our own. By split Foucault means power as a force for manipulation of the human body. Previous notions of power failed to account for the historical subject and general shifts in techniques of power-according to Foucault's genealogy or genesis of power – it was totally denied that manipulation of the human body by unforeseen, outside forces ever existed. According to this theory, it was human ingenuity and man's ability to increase his own rationalisation was the primary motion behind social phenomena and the human subject and change was a result of increasing human reason and human conscience ingenuity. Foucault denies that any such notion had ever existed in the historical record and insists that this kind of thought is a misleading abstraction. Foucault cites the main driving force behind this set of accelerated change was the modern human sciences and the technologies both available to skilled professionals from the 16th century and a whole set of clever techniques used to shift the whole old social order into the new order of things. However, what was significant was the notion of [[Population]] practised upon the entire human species on a global mass scale, not in separately locally defined areas. By population, Foucault means its fluidness and malleability, Foucault refers to ‘a multiplicity of men, not to the extent that they are nothing more than individual bodies, but to the extent that they form, on the contrary, a global mass that is affected by overall processes of birth, death, production, taxation, illness and so forth, one should also take note that Foucault does not just mean population as singular event but a means of circulation tied to factors of security. What again was also significant was the idea of "freedom" the population's "freedom" which was the new modern [[Nation state]] and the 'neo-discourse' erected around such notions as freedom, work and [[Liberalism]], the ideological stance of the state (mass popular democracy and the voting franchise) and the state was only too willing to recognize and give freedom for example as the object of security. Population, in Foucault's understanding, is understood as a self-regulating mass;an agglomeration or circulation of people and things which co-operate and co-produce order free from heavy state regulation the state governs less allowing the population to "govern itself". For Foucault, the freedom of population is grasped at the level of how elements of population circulate. Techniques of security enact themselves through, and upon, the circulation which occurs at the level of population.In Foucault's opinion the modern concept of population, as opposed to the ancient [[Ancient history|Antiquity]] and medieval version of "populousness" which has in its roots going as far back as the time period of the [[Book of Numbers]] in the [[Old testament]] [[Bible]] and the work that it sustained both in political theory and practice certainly does so; or, at least, the construction of the concept population is central to the creation of new orders of knowledge, new objects of intervention, new forms of subjectivity.

However, in order to fully understand what Foucault is trying to convey a few things should be said about the alteration techniques used that Foucault talks about in this series of lectures. The ancient and medieval version of [[Political power]] was centered around a central figure who was called a King, [[Emperor]], [[Prince]] or ruler (and in some cases the pope)of his principle territory whose rule was considered absolute ([[Absolute monarchy]]) by both [[Political philosophy]] and political theory of the day even in our time such notions still exist. Foucault uses the term population state to designate a new founded technology founded on the principal of security and territory which would mean a "population" to govern on a global mass with each population having its own territorial integrity(a separate nation) mapped out by experts in treaty negotiations&lt;ref&gt;''Colossal, unjustified' payments to Treaty negotiators'' Stuff 11 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiating International Trade Treaties Before Exit'' Francis Hoar '' UK's Right to Negotiate Free Trade Agreements before leaving the European Union'' 1 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and the new emerging field of 15th century [[Cartography|Advances in map-making technologies]] and the profession of [[Cartography]] eventually producing in the 18th century what we now know as [[nation states]]. These technologies take place at the level of "population" Foucault argues, and with the shifting aside of the body of the King or territorial ruler. By the time of the ending of the medieval period the body(or the persona of the king)of the territorial ruler became under increasingly under financial pressure and a cursory look at the medieval financial records tends to show that the monarch could not pay back all debts due to his creditors; the monarch would easily and readily default on loans due to any creditors causing financial ruin to creditors.Foucault notices that by the time of the 18th century several changes began to take place like the re-organization of armies, an emerging industrial working population begins to appear, (both military and industrial), the emergence of the [[Mathematical sciences]], [[Biological sciences]] and [[Physical sciences]] which, coincidently gave birth to a-what Foucault calls-Biopower and a political apparatus(machine) to take care of biological (in the form of medicine and health) and political life(mass democracy and the voting franchise for the population). An apparatus (both economic and political) was required much more sophisticated than previous social organisations of previous societies had at their disposal. For example, [[Bank]]s, which function as financial intermediaries and tied to the apparatus of the new 'state' machine which can easily pay back any large scale debts(large debts) which the King cannot, due to the king's own financial resources are limited;the king cannot pay back for example, the national debt, nor pay for a modern army out of his own personal resources, which can amount to trillions of US Dollars out of his own personal finances, that would be both impracticable and impossible.

== ''The Birth of Biopolitics'' (1978–1979) ==
{{Main article|The Birth of Biopolitics}}

''The Birth of Biopolitics'' develops further the notion of [[biopolitics]] that Foucault introduced in his lectures on "Society must be defended". It traces how eighteenth-century political economy marked the birth of a new governmental rationality and raises questions of political philosophy and social policy about the role and status of neo-liberalism in twentieth century politics.

Over the course of many centuries the association between biological phenomena and human political behaviour has received a great deal of attention. Recently(the last 60 years or so) in the academic field and journals there has been some development within the field of political and biological behaviour.In his College de France lecture course of January 1978 Foucault use the term Biopolitics(not for the first time) to denote politic power over every aspect of human life.Why did Foucault use the term Biopolitics in the first place?First of all the term Biopolitics has many different meanings to many different people and to fully understand the term as Foucault saw and used and understood it, we have to look at the very different meanings of the concept.For Foucault the term means to him the association between biological phenomena and human political behaviour maximizing and increasing the human abilities machine(as we know the term).Over the course of evolutionary time this abilities machine of man becomes species specific, such as language capabilities, neuronal and cognitive capabilities so on and so forth.This then becomes over the course of the history of discursive technologies of scientific knowledge Foucault argues;became a field of knowledge established by groups of experts in the field of [[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary Biology]], Physical sciences and Genetics for example.

The study of a new and rigorous discipline allied together with a new language(discourse technologies) in which a grasp of the new language is needed developing into a powerful force in the political realm as well as biological evolution the two become powerful allies (both biology and politics).Genetics and the change that develops(over time) over the course of the human organism existence.However, the two become co-joined unwittingly but one of them both political philosophy and political science have specific problems, both cannot have or lay claim to independent knowledge which is problematic for both lines of thought.Not in the case of ideology(as in Marxism) but in the case of discursive technologies.Foucault insists that the scientific knowledge being presented by historians is not an endeavour by the whole of humankind, particularly when written about by historians who claim that 'man' invented the sciences anymore than the Nazi represented the whole of humankind and the whole of humankind were to blame for the Nazi atrocities the ultimate embodiment of evil.But is, for all attempts and purposes a collaborative enterprise by groups of specially trained specialists producing a scientific community who have unfettered access to the whole of society through their scientific knowledge and expertise.

Change does indeed happen both within the organism and the organisms properties, the specific species is unable to correct them directly and biological change moves beyond any individual or single member of the species.However, these changes are aimed at the species as a whole and characteristics and traits are retained both at the biological, ecological and environmental level.In the human sciences (biology and genetics)these changes happen at a genetic and biological level which are unalterable and transpire from one generation to the next not at the individual level of the species.This is at the heart of the core theory of [[Charles Darwin]] and his proponents and the theory of [[Evolution]] and [[natural selection]].Foucault's analysis try's to show that contrary to previous thought that the modern human sciences were somehow an obscure universal objective source which somehow had an absence of any linage, took over the role of the Christian church in disciplining the body by replacing the soul and confession of the Catholic church plus also the specific director of the process which in this case would be the deity(God), with indefinite supervision and discipline. However, these new techniques required a new 'director(s)' or 'editor(s)' who replaced the priestly and [[Pharaonic]] versions of much similar past vintages.These new governmental mechanism based upon the right of sovereignty and law both supported the fixed hierarchical organisation of the previous mode of feudal governmental mechanism, but stripping the modern human subject of any kind of self autonomy; not only fully fit for indoctrination, work, and education a fully fit conversant subject but left them vulnerable as well to face a permanent exam which he(the ordinary individual) had no chance in passing and was supposed to fail with no end point.Foucault maintains that these techniques were deliberate, cold, calculating and ruthless;the human sciences, far from being "a way at looking at the world" the knowledge/power dynamic/relationship [[Paradigm]] was a 'cheap' efficient and 'cost' effective method into a way of producing a subjugated and docile human subject(not only a citizen, but a political and productive citizen) as an instrument for administrative control and concern(through the state) for the well being of the population(and a constant help to the spread of Biopower)with the help of scientific classifications and new disciplinary technologies including the polity readily available to the human body and mind. Here are a few examples on what Foucault means by this type of "biopower" and bio-history of man

The series starts at the first encounter with the offender and continues through to the process of change.It includes the issue of drug use in this population.The authors have detailed their research with what they termed "the criminal mind."Their definition of the criminal strongly resembles the description of antisocial-personality disorder and psychopathy.During the early stages of their research, Yochelson and Samenow limited their work to observation without the attempt of treatment.They detailed 52 features of criminal thinking that needed to be changed for rehabilitation to be a possibility.Patterns of deception are established early in this population and others rights are characteristically disregarded, and when arrested, this population tends to see themselves as victims and believe that they were good people despite their lengthy criminal records.Over time a treatment plan, or "process of change" was defined that change was most likely to occur in this population when the individual was vulnerable and desirous of change.The desire for change must be accompanied by an in depth knowledge of what needs to be changed.Finally, change is only possible when the long term benefits of change outweigh the benefits of maintaining a criminal lifestyle.Overall, change is considered a possibility, although not a common one.These three volumes comprise the most detailed, long-term examination of the criminal mind documented."

As with the most recent discovery of [[Mirror neurons]] has demonstrated Foucault has(while these techniques used in [[Psychiatry]] and [[Psychology]] are not mentioned alongside Foucault's name) hit on something that rigorous research methods may prove beyond a reasonable doubt that manipulation of social phenomena(which includes the human body and the mind) is most certainly possible.Techniques developed from the First and Second World war which started out as field experiments, among military personal, were then extended into ordinary civilian life; techniques borrowed from the Human cognitive sciences and found its way into [[Psychoanalysis|Psycho-analysis]], [[Psychiatry]], [[Psychology]], [[Clinical psychology]], [[Lightner Witmer]] and [[Clinical psychiatry]] (see this encyclopedia's article on [[Political abuse of psychiatry]]):"Mobilisation and manipulation of human needs as they exist in the consumer".He([[Ernest Dichter]]) "was the first to coin the term focus group and to stress the importance of image and persuasion in advertising".In [[Vance Packard]]'s book, [[The Hidden Persuaders]] Dichter's name is mentioned extensively.Subjectivation, a term Foucault coined for this purpose in which Biological life itself is given over to constant testing and research(an examination) without ever ending.One could argue;who are these new experts answerable too?Foucault argues that these new experts are answerable to absolutely no one.Just like previous notions of the past, absolute monarchy and divine rights of kings were answerable to nobody, their predecessors are just replacements of the past these new experts have now been democratised.Where mans body (and his soul)his mind can be manipulated and altered and is liable to be vulnerable. Every single aspect of the human subject is ripe for '[[Subjectification (linguistics)|subjectification]]' and the technology-as it stands today-is unknown to us.This Biological ''allegory of man carries with it endless possibilities from the perspective of the [[Biological Sciences|Biological sciences]] and [[Physical Sciences|Physical sciences]].The above extractions clearly show this “Biopower” of man requires man himself to administer these sophisticated technologies, where one group of experts or professionals(the enquiry) can completely subjugate another producing new human subjects(and new experts) through their expertise at manipulating social phenomena.In these few examples and according to this view:”the criminal is treated like a cancer” whereas human nature does not change which is the only society that ever gets produced, past,present or future.''

== ''On The Government Of The Living '' (1979–1980) ==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2015}}
In the ''On The Government Of The Living'' lectures delivered in the early months of 1980, Foucault begins to ask questions of Western man obedience to power structures unreservedly and the pressing question of Government: "Government of children, government of souls and consciences, government of a household, of a state, or of oneself." Or [[governmentality]], as Foucault prefers to call it, although he fleshes out the development of that concept in his earlier lectures titled "Security, Territory, Population." Foucault tries to trace the kernel of "the genealogy of obedience" in western society. The 1980 lectures attempt to relate the historical foundations of "our obedience"—which must be understood as the obedience of the Western subject. Foucault argues confessional techniques are an innovation of the Christian West intended to guarantee men’s obedience to structures of power in return, so the belief goes, for Christian salvation.In his summary of the course Foucault asks the question: "How is it that within Western Christian culture, the government of men requires, on the part of those who are led, in addition to acts of obedience and submission, ‘acts of truth,’ which have this particular character that not only is the subject required to speak truthfully but to speak truthfully about himself?" The reader should take note here that much of this kind of work has been done before, albeit in what is best described as brilliant, lost and forgotten scholarship by such scholars as [[Ernst Kantorowicz]] (his work on the [[body politic]] and the king's two bodies), [[Percy Ernst Schramm]], [[Carl Erdmann]], [[Hermann Kantorowicz]], [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Frederick Pollock]] and [[Frederick Maitland]]. However, Foucault was after the genealogical dynamics and his main thrust was "regimes of truth" and the emergence and gradual development of "reflexive acts of truth". Foucault locates the very beginning of this act of obedience to power structures and the truth that they bring to the first Christian institutions between the 2nd century and the 5th century C.E. This is where Foucault starts to use his main tool—that is [[Genealogy (philosophy)|Genealogy]] as his main focus and it is with this genealogical tool that you finally get to understand fully what genealogy actually means. Foucault goes into great painstaking detail into the Christian [[baptism]] and its contingency and discontinuity in order to find "the genealogy of confession". This is an attempt-argues Foucault-to write a "political history of the truth".

== ''The Hermeneutics of the Subject'' (1980–1981) ==
In these lectures, Foucault develops notions on the ability of the concept of truth to shift through time as described by the modern human sciences (for example [[Ethology]]) in contrast to ancient society (Aristotelian notions). It discusses how these notions are accepted as truth and produce the self as true. This is followed by a discussion on the existence of this truth and the discourse of truth for the experience of the self.

The '''''Foundation'' series''' is a [[science fiction]] book series written by American author [[Isaac Asimov]]. For nearly thirty years, the series was a trilogy: ''[[Foundation (Asimov novel)|Foundation]]'', ''[[Foundation and Empire]]'', and ''[[Second Foundation]]''. It won the one-time [[Hugo Award]] for "Best All-Time Series" in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1966-hugo-awards/| title=1966 Hugo Awards| publisher=[[Hugo Award]]| website=thehugoawards.org| accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nesfa.org/data/LL/Hugos/hugos1966.html| title=The Long List of Hugo Awards, 1966| accessdate=July 28, 2017| publisher=[[New England Science Fiction Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov began adding to the series in 1981, with two sequels: ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'', ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'', and two prequels: ''[[Prelude to Foundation]]'', ''[[Forward the Foundation]]''. The additions made reference to events in Asimov's [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'']] and [[Galactic Empire (series)|''Empire'' series]], indicating that they were also set in the same fictional universe.

The premise of the series is that the mathematician [[Hari Seldon]] spent his life developing a branch of mathematics known as [[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]], a concept of [[mathematical sociology]]. Using the laws of [[mass action (sociology)|mass action]], it can predict the future, but only on a large scale. Seldon foresees the imminent fall of the [[Galactic Empire (Isaac Asimov)|Galactic Empire]], which encompasses the entire [[Milky Way]], and a [[Dark Ages (historiography)|dark age]] lasting 30,000 years before a second great empire arises. Seldon's calculations also show there is a way to limit this interregnum to just one thousand years. To ensure the more favorable outcome and reduce human misery during the intervening period, Seldon creates the Foundation – a group of talented artisans and engineers positioned at the twinned extreme ends of the galaxy – to preserve and expand on humanity's collective knowledge, and thus become the foundation for the accelerated resurgence of this new galactic empire.

==Publication history==

===Original stories===
The original trilogy of novels were originally a series of eight short stories published in ''[[Astounding Magazine]]'' between May 1942 and January 1950. According to Asimov, the premise was based on ideas set forth in [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', and was invented spontaneously on his way to meet with editor [[John W. Campbell]], with whom he developed the concepts of the collapse of the [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]], the civilization-preserving Foundations, and psychohistory.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac. La edad de oro II. Plaza &amp; Janes. 1987. P 252–253 (Spanish language translation of [[The Early Asimov]]) See afterword for the "Legal Rites" story.&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov wrote these early stories in his [[West Philadelphia]] apartment when he worked at the [[Philadelphia Naval Yard]].

===''Foundation'' trilogy===
The first four stories were collected, along with a new story taking place before the others, as a [[fixup]] published by [[Gnome Press]] in 1951 as ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]''. The remainder of the stories were published in pairs by Gnome as ''[[Foundation and Empire]]'' (1952) and ''[[Second Foundation]]'' (1953), resulting in the "Foundation Trilogy", as the series is still known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=ISAAC ASIMOV |title=Foundation's Edge |publisher=Spectra |location=Halmstad |year=1982 |page=1 |isbn=0-553-29338-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later sequels and prequels===
In 1981, Asimov was persuaded by his publishers to write a fourth book, which became ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'' (1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=ISAAC ASIMOV |title=Foundation and Earth |publisher=Spectra |location=Halmstad |year= |pages= |isbn=0-553-58757-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years later, Asimov followed up with yet another sequel, ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' (1986), which was followed by the prequels ''[[Prelude to Foundation]]'' (1988) and ''[[Forward the Foundation]]'' (1993), published after his death in 1992. During the two-year lapse between writing the sequels and prequels, Asimov had tied in his ''Foundation'' series with his various other series, creating a single unified universe. The basic link is mentioned in ''Foundation's Edge'': an obscure tradition about a first wave of space settlements with robots and then a second without. The idea is the one developed in ''[[Robots of Dawn]]'', which, in addition to showing the way that the second wave of settlements were to be allowed, illustrates the benefits and shortcomings of the first wave of settlements and their so-called ''[[carbon|C]]/[[iron|Fe]]'' (carbon/iron, signifying humans and robots together) culture. In this same book, the word ''psychohistory'' is used to describe the nascent idea of Seldon's work. Some of the drawbacks to this style of colonization, also called ''Spacer'' culture, are also exemplified by the events described in ''[[The Naked Sun]]''.

==Plot==

''Note: This plot is listed in the fictional chronological order of the stories in the series, which is not the order of publication. The series itself was left as a trilogy for many years, comprising "Foundation", "Foundation and Empire" and "Second Foundation". The two novels set chronologically earlier than the original trilogy, and the two which follow it, were later added to the series.''

===''Prelude to Foundation''===
{{main|Prelude to Foundation}}
''Prelude to Foundation'' opens on the planet [[Trantor]], the empire's capital planet, the day after [[Hari Seldon]] has given a speech at a mathematics conference. Several parties become aware of the content of his speech (that using mathematical formulas, it may be possible to predict the future course of human history). Seldon is hounded by the Emperor and various employed thugs who are working surreptitiously, which forces him into exile. Over the course of the book, Seldon and [[Dors Venabili]], a female companion and professor of history, are taken from location to location by [[Chetter Hummin]] who, under the guise of a reporter, introduces them to various Trantorian walks of life in his attempts to keep Seldon hidden from the Emperor.
Throughout their adventures all over Trantor, Seldon continuously denies that psychohistory is a realistic science. Even if feasible, it may take several decades to develop. Hummin, however, is convinced that Seldon knows something, so he continuously presses him to work out a starting point to develop psychohistory.
Eventually, after much traveling and introductions to various, diverse cultures on Trantor, Seldon realizes that using the entire known galaxy as a starting point is too overwhelming; he then decides to use Trantor as a model to work out the science, with a goal of later using the applied knowledge on the rest of the galaxy.

===''Forward the Foundation''===
{{main|Forward the Foundation}}
Eight years after the events of ''Prelude'', Seldon has worked out the science of psychohistory and has applied it on a galactic scale. His notability and fame increase and he is eventually promoted to First Minister to the Emperor. As the book progresses, Seldon loses those closest to him, including his wife, Dors Venabili, as his own health deteriorates into old age. Having worked his entire adult life to understand psychohistory, Seldon instructs his granddaughter, Wanda, to set up the Second Foundation.

===''Foundation''===
{{main|Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)}}
Called forth to stand trial on Trantor for allegations of treason (for foreshadowing the decline of the Galactic Empire), Seldon explains that his science of psychohistory foresees many alternatives, all of which result in the Galactic Empire eventually falling. If humanity follows its current path, the Empire will fall and 30,000 years of turmoil will overcome humanity before a second Empire arises. However, an alternative path allows for the intervening years to be only one thousand, if Seldon is allowed to collect the most intelligent minds and create a compendium of all human knowledge, entitled ''[[Encyclopedia Galactica]]''. The board is still wary but allows Seldon to assemble whomever he needs, provided he and the "Encyclopedists" be exiled to a remote planet, [[Terminus (planet)|Terminus]]. Seldon agrees to these terms – and also secretly establishes a second Foundation of which almost nothing is known, which he says is at the "opposite end" of the galaxy.

After fifty years on Terminus, and with Seldon now deceased, the inhabitants find themselves in a crisis. With four powerful planets surrounding their own, the Encyclopedists have no defenses but their own intelligence. At the same time, a vault left by Seldon is due to automatically open. The vault reveals a pre-recorded [[hologram]] of Seldon, who informs the Encyclopedists that their entire reason for being on Terminus is a fraud, insofar as Seldon did not actually care whether or not an encyclopedia was created, only that the population was placed on Terminus and the events needed by his calculations were set in motion. In reality, the recording discloses, Terminus was set up to reduce the dark ages from 30,000 years to just one millennium, based on following his calculations. It will develop by facing intermittent and extreme "crises" – known as "Seldon Crises" – which the laws governing psychohistory show will inevitably be overcome, simply because human nature will cause events to fall in particular ways which lead to the intended goal. The recording reveals that the present events are the first such crisis, reminds them that a second foundation was also formed at the "opposite end" of the galaxy, and then falls silent.

The Mayor of Terminus City, [[Salvor Hardin]], proposes to play the planets against each other. His plan is a success; the Foundation remains untouched, and he is promoted to Mayor of Terminus (the planet). Meanwhile, the minds of the Foundation continue to develop newer and greater technologies which are smaller and more powerful than the Empire's equivalents. Using its scientific advantage, Terminus develops trade routes with nearby planets, eventually taking them over when its technology becomes a much-needed commodity. The interplanetary traders effectively become the new diplomats to other planets. One such trader, [[Hober Mallow]], becomes powerful enough to challenge and win the seat of Mayor and, by cutting off supplies to a nearby region, also succeeds in adding more planets to the Foundation's reach.

===''Foundation and Empire''===
{{main|Foundation and Empire}}
An ambitious general of the current Emperor of the Galaxy perceives the Foundation as a growing threat and orders an attack on it, using the Empire's still-mighty fleet of war vessels. The Emperor, initially supportive, becomes suspicious of his general's long-term motive for the attack, and recalls the fleet despite being close to victory. In spite of its undoubted inferiority in purely military terms, the Foundation emerges as the victor and the Empire itself is defeated. Seldon's hologram reappears in the vault on Terminus, and explains to the Foundation that this opening of the vault follows a conflict whose result was inevitable whatever might have been done – a weak Imperial navy could not have attacked them, while a strong navy would have shown itself by its successes to be a direct threat to the Emperor himself and been recalled.

A century later, an unknown outsider called the Mule has begun taking over planets belonging to the Foundation at a rapid pace. The Foundation comes to realize the Mule is a [[mutant]], unforeseen in Seldon's plan, and that the plan cannot have predicted any certainty of defeating him. [[Toran and Bayta Darell]], accompanied by [[Ebling Mis]] – the galaxy's current greatest psychologist – and a court jester familiar with the Mule named Magnifico (whom they agree to protect, as his life is under threat from the Mule himself), set out to find the Second Foundation, hoping to bring an end to the Mule's reign. Mis studies furiously in the Great Library of Trantor to decipher the Second Foundation's location in order to visit it and seek their help.  He is successful and also deduces that the Mule's success stems from his mutation; he is able to change the emotions of others, a power he used to first instill fear in the inhabitants of his conquered planets, then to make his enemies devoutly loyal to him. Mis is killed by Bayta Darell before he can reveal the location, having realised that Magnifico is in fact the Mule and has been using his gifts to drive Mis forward in his research, so that he can learn the location himself and subjugate the Second Foundation also. Dismayed at having made a mistake which allowed Bayta to see through his disguise, the Mule leaves Trantor to rule over his conquered planets while continuing his search.

===''Second Foundation''===
{{main|Second Foundation}}
As the Mule comes closer to finding it, the mysterious Second Foundation comes briefly out of hiding to face the threat directly. It consists of the descendants of Seldon's psychohistorians. While the first Foundation has developed the physical sciences, the Second Foundation has been developing Seldon's mathematics and the Seldon Plan, along with their own use of mental sciences. The Second Foundation ultimately wears down the Mule, who returns to rule over his kingdom peacefully for the rest of his life, without any further thought of conquering the Second Foundation.

However, as a result, the first Foundation has learned something of the Second Foundation beyond the simple fact that it exists, and has some understanding of its role. This means their behavior will now be chosen in light of that knowledge, and not based on uninformed natural human behavior, which means their behavior will no longer be the natural responses required by the mathematics of the Seldon Plan. This places the Plan itself at great risk. Additionally, the first Foundation instead starts to resentfully consider the other as a rival, and begins to develop equipment related to detecting and blocking mental influence, in order to detect members of the Second Foundation. After many attempts to unravel the Second Foundation's whereabouts from the minimal clues available, the Foundation is led to believe the Second Foundation is located on Terminus (being the "opposite end" of a galaxy, for a galaxy with a circular shape). The Foundation uncovers and destroys a group of fifty members of the Second Foundation and is left believing they have destroyed the Second Foundation. No longer concerned at the perceived threat, their behaviors as a society will tend to be those anticipated by the Plan.

In fact the group of fifty were volunteers on Terminus whose role was to be captured and give the impression that they composed the whole of the Second Foundation, so that the Seldon Plan would be able to continue unimpeded. The Second Foundation, itself, is finally revealed to be located on the former Imperial Homeworld of Trantor. The clue "at Star's End" was not a physical clue, but was instead based on an old saying, "All roads lead to Trantor, and that is where all stars end." Seldon, being a social scientist and not a physical one, placed the two Foundations at "opposite ends" of the galaxy, but in a sociological rather than physical sense. The first Foundation was located on the Periphery of the galaxy, where the Empire's influence was minimal; the Second Foundation was on Trantor, where, even in its dying days, the Empire's power and culture was strongest.

===''Foundation's Edge''===
{{main|Foundation's Edge}}
Believing the Second Foundation still exists (despite the common belief that it has been extinguished), young politician [[Golan Trevize]] is sent into [[exile]] by the current Mayor of the Foundation, [[List of minor Foundation series characters#Harla Branno|Harla Branno]], to uncover the Second Foundation; [[Golan Trevize|Trevize]] is accompanied by a scholar named [[Janov Pelorat]]. The reason for their belief is that, despite the unforeseeable impact of the Mule, the Seldon Plan still appears to be proceeding in accordance with the statements of Seldon's hologram, suggesting that the Second Foundation still exists and is secretly intervening to bring the plan back on course. After a few conversations with Pelorat, Trevize comes to believe that a mythical planet called [[Earth (Foundation universe)|Earth]] may hold the secret to the location. No such planet exists in any database, yet several myths and legends all refer to it, and it is Trevize's belief that the planet is deliberately being kept hidden. Unknown to Trevize and Pelorat, Branno is tracking their ship so that, in the event they find the Second Foundation, the first Foundation can take military or other action.

Meanwhile, [[Stor Gendibal]], a prominent member of the Second Foundation, discovers a simple local on Trantor who has had a very subtle alteration made to her mind, far more delicate than anything the Second Foundation can do. He concludes that a greater force of Mentalics must be active in the Galaxy. Following the events on Terminus, Gendibal endeavors to follow Trevize, reasoning that by doing so, he may find out who has altered the mind of the Trantor native.

Using the few scraps of reliable information within the various myths, Trevize and Pelorat discover a planet called Gaia which is inhabited solely by Mentalics, to such an extent that every organism and inanimate object on the planet shares a common mind. Both Branno and Gendibal, who have separately followed Trevize, also reach Gaia at the same time. Gaia reveals that it has engineered this situation because it wishes to do what is best for humanity but cannot be sure what is best. Trevize's purpose, faced with the leaders of both the First and Second Foundations and Gaia itself, is to be trusted to make the best decision among the three main alternatives for the future of the human race: the First Foundation's path, based on mastery of the physical world and its traditional political organization (i.e., Empire); the Second Foundation's path, based on mentalics and probable rule by an elite using mind control; or Gaia's path of absorption of the entire Galaxy into one shared, harmonious living entity in which all beings, and the galaxy itself, would be a part.

After Trevize makes his decision for Gaia's path, the intellect of Gaia adjusts both Branno's and Gendibal's minds so that each believes he or she has succeeded in a significant task. (Branno believes she has successfully negotiated a treaty tying Sayshell to the Foundation, and Gendibal – now leader (and First Speaker) of the Second Foundation – believes that the Second Foundation is victorious and should continue as normal.) Trevize remains, but is uncertain as to why he has intuited (is "sure") that Gaia is the correct outcome for the future.

===''Foundation and Earth''===
{{main|Foundation and Earth}}
Still uncertain about his decision, Trevize continues on with the search for Earth along with Pelorat and a local of Gaia, advanced in Mentalics, known as Blissenobiarella (usually referred to simply as Bliss). Eventually, Trevize finds three sets of coordinates which are very old. Adjusting them for time, he realizes that his ship's computer does not list any planet in the vicinity of the coordinates. When he physically visits the locations, he rediscovers the forgotten worlds of [[Aurora (planet)|Aurora]], [[Solaria]], and finally [[Melpomenia]]. After searching and facing different dilemmas on each planet, Trevize still has not discovered any answers.

Aurora and Melpomenia are long deserted, but Solaria contains a small population which is extremely advanced in the field of Mentalics. When the lives of the group are threatened, Bliss uses her abilities (and the shared intellect of Gaia) to destroy the Solarian who is about to kill them. This leaves behind a small child who will be put to death if left alone, so Bliss makes the decision to keep the child as they quickly escape the planet.

Eventually, Trevize discovers Earth, but it, again, contains no satisfactory answers for him (it is also long-since deserted). However, it dawns on Trevize that the answer may not be on Earth, but on Earth's satellite – the Moon. Upon approaching the planet, they are drawn inside the Moon's core, where they meet a robot named [[R. Daneel Olivaw]].

Olivaw explains that he has been instrumental in guiding human history for thousands of years, having provided the impetus for Seldon to create psychohistory and also the creation of Gaia, but is now close to the end of his ability to maintain himself and will cease to function. Despite replacing his [[positronic]] brain (which contain 20,000 years of memories), he is going to die shortly. He explains that no further robotic brain can be devised to replace his current one, or which will let him continue assisting for the benefit of humanity. However, some additional time can be won to ensure the long term benefit of humanity by merging [[R. Daneel Olivaw|R. Daniel Olivaw's]] mind with the organic intellect of a human – in this case, the intellect of the child that the group rescued on Solaria.

Once again, Trevize is put in the position of deciding if having Olivaw meld with the child's superior intellect would be in the best interests of the galaxy. The decision is left ambiguous (though likely a "yes") as it is implied that the melding of the minds may be to the child's benefit, but that she may have sinister intentions about it.

==Development and themes==
The early stories were inspired by [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''. The plot of the series focuses on the growth and reach of the Foundation, against a backdrop of the "decline and fall of the Galactic Empire." The themes of Asimov's stories were also influenced by the political tendency in SF fandom, associated with the [[Futurians]], known as [[John Michel (science fiction)|Michelism]].

The focus of the books is the trends through which a civilization might progress, specifically seeking to analyze their progress, using history as a precedent. Although many science fiction novels such as ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' or ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' do this, their focus is upon how current trends in society might come to fruition, and act as a moral allegory on the modern world. The ''Foundation'' series, on the other hand, looks at the trends in a wider scope, dealing with societal evolution and adaptation rather than the human and cultural qualities at one point in time.

Furthermore, the concept of psychohistory, which gives the events in the story a sense of rational fatalism, leaves little room for moralization. Hari Seldon himself hopes that his Plan will "reduce 30,000 years of Dark Ages and barbarism to a single millennium," a goal of exceptional moral gravity. Yet events within it are often treated as inevitable and necessary, rather than deviations from the greater good. For example, the Foundation slides gradually into oligarchy and dictatorship prior to the appearance of the galactic conqueror, known as the [[Mule (Foundation)|Mule]], who was able to succeed through the random chance of a telepathic mutation. But, for the most part, the book treats the purpose of [[Seldon Plan|Seldon's plan]] as unquestionable, and that slide as being necessary in it, rather than mulling over whether the slide is, on the whole, positive or negative.

The books also wrestle with the idea of individualism. Hari Seldon's plan is often treated as an inevitable mechanism of society, a vast mindless [[mob mentality]] of quadrillions of humans across the galaxy. Many in the series struggle against it, only to fail. However, the plan itself is reliant upon the cunning of individuals such as [[Salvor Hardin]] and [[Hober Mallow]] to make wise decisions that capitalize on the trends. On the other hand, the Mule, a single individual with mental powers, topples the Foundation and nearly destroys the Seldon plan with his special, unforeseen abilities. To repair the damage the Mule inflicts, the Second Foundation deploys a plan which turns upon individual reactions. Psychohistory is based on group trends and cannot predict with sufficient accuracy the effects of extraordinary, unforeseeable individuals, and as originally presented, the Second Foundation's purpose was to counter this flaw. Later novels would identify the Plan's uncertainties that remained at Seldon's death as the primary reason for the existence of the Second Foundation, which (unlike the First) had retained the capacity to research and further develop psychohistory.

Asimov tried unsuccessfully to end the series with ''[[Second Foundation]]''. However, because of the predicted thousand years until the rise of the next Empire (of which only a few hundred had elapsed), the series lacked a sense of closure. For decades, fans pressured him to write a sequel. In 1982, after a 30-year hiatus, Asimov gave in and wrote what was at the time a fourth volume: ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. This was followed shortly thereafter by ''[[Foundation and Earth]]''. The story of this volume (which takes place some 500 years after Seldon) ties up all the loose ends and brings together all of his Robot, Empire, and Foundation novels into a single story. He also opens a brand new line of thought in the last dozen pages regarding [[Gaia (Foundation universe)#Galaxia|Galaxia]], a galaxy inhabited by a single collective mind. This concept was never explored further. According to his widow [[Janet Asimov]] (in her biography of Isaac, ''[[It's Been a Good Life]]''), he had no idea how to continue after ''Foundation and Earth'', so he started writing the prequels.

==The Foundation series==

===Merging with other series===
The series is set in the same universe as Asimov's first published novel, ''[[Pebble in the Sky]]'', although ''Foundation'' takes place about 10,000 years later. ''Pebble in the Sky'' became the basis for the [[Galactic Empire (series)|''Empire'' series]]. Then, at some unknown date (prior to writing ''Foundation's Edge'') Asimov decided to merge the ''Foundation''/''Empire'' series with his [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'' series]]. Thus, all three series are set in the same universe, giving them a combined length of 15 novels, and a total of about 1,500,000 words (see the [[#Asimov's books within the Foundation series|List of books]] below). The merge also created a time-span of the series of around 20,000 years.

The stand-alone story ''[[Nemesis (Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'' is also in the same continuity; being referenced in ''[[Forward the Foundation]]'', where [[Hari Seldon]] refers to a twenty-thousand-year-old story of "a young woman that could communicate with an entire planet that circled a sun named Nemesis." Commentators noted that ''Nemesis'' contains barely disguised references to the Spacers and their calendar system, the Galactic Empire and even to Hari Seldon which seem to have been deliberately placed for the purpose of later integration into the ''Foundation'' universe.&lt;ref name="From Robots to Foundations" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Codex|first1=Regius|title=From Robots to Foundations|date=2014|location=Wiesbaden/Ljubljana|isbn=1499569823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timeline inconsistencies===
Early on during Asimov's original world-building of the ''Foundation'' universe, he established within the first published stories a chronology placing the tales about 50,000 years into the future from the time they were written (''circa'' 1940). This precept was maintained in the pages of his first novel ''Pebble in the Sky'', wherein Imperial archaeologist [[Bel Arvardan]] refers to ancient human strata discovered in the Sirius sector dating back "some 50,000 years". However, when Asimov decided decades later to retroactively integrate the universe of his ''Foundation'' and ''Galactic Empire'' novels with that of his ''Robot'' stories, a number of changes and minor discrepancies surfaced – the character [[R. Daneel Olivaw]] was established as having existed for some 20,000 years, with the original ''Robot'' novels featuring the character occurring not more than a couple of millennia after the early-21st century [[Susan Calvin]] short stories. Also, in ''Foundation's Edge'', mankind was referred to as having possessed interstellar space travel for only 22,000 years, a far cry from the 50 millennia of earlier works.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In the spring of 1955, Asimov published an early timeline in the pages of ''[[Thrilling Wonder Stories]]'' magazine based upon his thought processes concerning the ''Foundation'' universe's history at that point in his life, which vastly differs from its modern-era counterpart. Many included stories would later be either jettisoned from the later chronology or temporally relocated by the author. Also, the aforementioned lengthier scope of time was changed. For example, in the original 1950s timeline, humanity does not discover the hyperspatial drive until around 5000 AD, whereas in the reincorporated ''Robot'' universe chronology, the first interstellar jump occurs in 2029 AD, during the events of ''[[I, Robot]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Timeline.html |title=An Early Asimov Timeline |publisher=Asimovreviews.net |date=2006-02-14 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other authors==
Asimov's novels covered only 500 of the expected 1,000 years it would take for the Foundation to become a galactic empire. The novels written after Asimov did not continue the timeline but rather sought to fill in gaps in the earlier stories. The ''Foundation'' universe was once again revisited in 1989's ''[[Foundation's Friends]]'', a collection of short stories written by many prominent science fiction authors of that time. [[Orson Scott Card]]'s "[[The Originist]]" clarifies the founding of the Second Foundation shortly after Seldon's death; [[Harry Turtledove]]'s "Trantor Falls" tells of the efforts by the Second Foundation to survive during the sacking of Trantor, the imperial capital and Second Foundation's home; and [[George Zebrowski]]'s "Foundation's Conscience" is about the efforts of a historian to document Seldon's work following the rise of the Second Galactic Empire.

Also, shortly before his death in 1992, Asimov approved an outline for three novels, known as the Caliban trilogy by [[Roger MacBride Allen]], set between ''[[Robots and Empire]]'' and the Empire series. The Caliban trilogy describes the terraforming of the [[Spacer (Asimov)|Spacer]] world Inferno, a planet where an ecological crisis forces the Spacers to abandon many long-cherished parts of their culture. Allen's novels echo the uncertainties that Asimov's later books express about the [[Three Laws of Robotics]], and in particular the way a thoroughly roboticized culture can degrade human initiative.

After Asimov's death and at the request of Janet Asimov and the Asimov estate's representative, Ralph Vicinanza approached [[Gregory Benford]], and asked him to write another ''Foundation'' story. He eventually agreed, and with Vicinanza and after speaking "to several authors about [the] project", formed a plan for a trilogy with "two hard SF writers broadly influenced by Asimov and of unchallenged technical ability: [[Greg Bear]] and [[David Brin]]."&lt;ref&gt;Quotes from the Author's afterword in Foundation's Fear (Benford)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Foundation's Fear]]'' (1997) takes place chronologically between part one and part two of Asimov's second prequel novel, ''[[Forward the Foundation]]''; ''[[Foundation and Chaos]]'' (1998) is set at the same time as the first chapter of ''Foundation'', filling in background; ''[[Foundation's Triumph]]'' (1999) covers ground following the recording of the holographic messages to the Foundation, and ties together a number of loose ends. These books are now claimed by some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikander.org/foundation.php|title=TimeLine for the Robots &amp; Foundations Universe|first=|last=sikander|website=www.sikander.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kaedrin.com/fun/asimov/newfound.html|title=The Second Foundation Series - Kaedrin's Guide to Isaac Asimov|website=kaedrin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to collectively be a "''Second Foundation'' trilogy", although they are inserts into pre-existing prequels and some of the earlier Foundation storylines and not generally recognized as a new Trilogy.

In an epilogue to ''Foundation's Triumph'', Brin noted he could imagine himself or a different author writing another sequel to add to ''Foundation's Triumph'', feeling that Hari Seldon's story was not yet necessarily finished. He later published a possible start of such a book on his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbrin.com/foundationdenouement1.html|title=worlds of DAVID BRIN|first=David Brin, Runaway|last=Serfer|website=www.davidbrin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the Asimov estate authorized publication of another trilogy of robot mysteries by [[Mark W. Tiedemann]]. These novels, which take place several years before Asimov's ''Robots and Empire'', are ''Mirage'' (2000), ''Chimera'' (2001), and ''Aurora'' (2002). These were followed by yet another robot mystery, [[Alexander C. Irvine]]'s ''Have Robot, Will Travel'' (2004), set five years after the Tiedemann trilogy.

In 2001, Donald Kingsbury published the novel ''[[Psychohistorical Crisis]]'', set in the Foundation universe after the start of the Second Empire.

Novels by various authors (''Isaac Asimov's'' ''[[Isaac Asimov's Robot City|Robot City]]'', ''[[Isaac Asimov's Robots and Aliens|Robots and Aliens]]'' and ''[[Isaac Asimov's Robots in Time|Robots in Time]]'' series) are loosely connected to the ''Robot'' series, but contain many inconsistencies with Asimov's books, and are not generally considered part of the ''Foundation'' series.

In November 2009, the Isaac Asimov estate announced the upcoming publication of'' Robots and Chaos'', the first volume in a trilogy featuring Susan Calvin by fantasy author [[Mickey Zucker Reichert]]. The book was published in November 2011 under the title ''I, Robot: To Protect''.

==Cultural impact==

===Impact in nonfiction===
In ''Learned Optimism'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Seligman|Seligman, Martin]]. ''Learned Optimism'' ((c) 1998 by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.), 185ff.&lt;/ref&gt; psychologist [[Martin Seligman]] identifies the ''Foundation'' series as one of the most important influences in his professional life, because of the possibility of predictive sociology based on psychological principles. He also lays claim to the first successful prediction of a major historical (sociological) event, in the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 US elections]], and he specifically attributes this to a psychological principle.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman discusses the successful prediction of the Presidential and 33 Senatorial elections based on an evaluation of the candidates' optimism as expressed in their speeches, and the principle that American voters systematically favor optimistic candidates.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1996 book ''To Renew America'', [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|U. S. House Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]] wrote how he was influenced by reading the ''Foundation'' trilogy in high school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/143446 "Newt Gingrich the Galactic Historian"]. [[Ray Smock]], [[History News Network]], 08 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Krugman]], winner of the 2008 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], credits the ''Foundation'' series with turning his mind to economics, as the closest existing science to psychohistory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/04/paul-krugman-asimov-economics|title=Paul Krugman: Asimov's Foundation novels grounded my economics|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=4 December 2012|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec08/nobelkrugman_10-13.html|title=U.S. Economist Krugman Wins Nobel Prize in Economics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nonfiction PBS series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'', [[Carl Sagan]] referred to an ''Encyclopedia Galactica'' in the episodes "Encyclopaedia Galactica" and "Who Speaks for Earth".

===Awards===
In 1966, the ''Foundation'' trilogy beat several other science fiction and fantasy series to receive a special [[Hugo Award]] for "Best All-Time Series". The runners-up for the award were ''[[Barsoom series]]'' by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], ''[[Future History (Heinlein)|Future History series]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], ''[[Lensman series]]'' by [[Edward E. Smith]] and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].&lt;ref name=Hugo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1966-hugo-awards/|title=1966 Hugo Awards|date=26 July 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation series is still the only series so honored. Asimov himself wrote that he assumed the one-time award had been created to honor ''The Lord of the Rings'', and he was amazed when his work won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954–1978|last= Asimov|first= Isaac|date= 1980|publisher=Doubleday|location= Garden City, New York|isbn= 0-385-15544-1|at= chapter 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series has won three other Hugo Awards. ''Foundation's Edge'' won Best Novel in 1983, and was a bestseller for almost a year. Retrospective Hugo Awards were given in 1996 and 2018 for, respectively, "The Mule" (the major part of ''Foundation and Empire'') for Best Novel (1946) and "Foundation" (the first story written for the series, and second chapter of the first novel) for Best Short Story (1943).

===Impact in fiction and entertainment===
Science fiction parodies, such as [[Douglas Adams]]' ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' and [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s ''[[Bill, the Galactic Hero]]'', often display clear ''Foundation'' influences. For instance, "The Guide" of the former is a spoof of the ''[[Encyclopedia Galactica]]'', and the series actually mentions the encyclopedia by name, remarking that it is rather "dry", and consequently sells fewer copies than the guide; the latter also features the ultra-urbanized Imperial planet Helior, often parodying the logistics such a planet-city would require, but that Asimov's novel downplays when describing Trantor.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In 1995, [[Donald Kingsbury]] wrote "Historical Crisis", which he later expanded into a novel, ''[[Psychohistorical Crisis]]''. It takes place about 2,000 years after ''Foundation'', after the founding of the Second Galactic Empire. It is set in the same fictional universe as the Foundation series, in considerable detail, but with virtually all ''Foundation''-specific names either changed (e.g., Kalgan becomes Lakgan), or avoided (psychohistory is created by an unnamed, but often-referenced Founder). The novel explores the ideas of psychohistory in a number of new directions, inspired by more recent developments in mathematics and [[computer science]], as well as by new ideas in science fiction itself.

In 1998, the novel [[Spectre (Star Trek)]] (part of the [[Shatnerverse]] series) by [[William Shatner]] and [[Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens]] states that the [[Mirror Universe]] divergent path has been studied by the ''Seldon Psychohistory Institute''.

The [[oboe]]-like holophonor in [[Matt Groening]]'s animated television series ''[[Futurama]]'' is based directly upon the "Visi-Sonor" which [[Mule (Foundation)|Magnifico]] plays in ''Foundation and Empire.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Cohen, David X.|date=2003|title=Futurama season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox|quote=Of course, you'll remember the holophonor [...] as we've said [...] is inspired by an instrument in [...] Foundation, one of the Foundation books, Isaac Asimov, the Mule plays an instrument much like that, except that it controls peoples minds.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Visi-Sonor" is also mirrored in an episode of ''[[Special Unit 2]]'', where a child's television character plays an instrument that induces mind control over children.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

During the 2006–2007 [[Marvel Comics]] [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline, in [[Fantastic Four]] #542 [[Mister Fantastic]] revealed his own attempt to develop psychohistory, saying he was inspired after reading the Foundation series.

According to lead singer [[Ian Gillan]], the hard rock band [[Deep Purple]]'s song ''The Mule'' is based on the Foundation character: "Yes, The Mule was inspired by Asimov. It's been a while but I'm sure you've made the right connection...Asimov was required reading in the 60's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gillan.com/qa-62.html|title=Caramba - Q&amp;a|website=www.gillan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio adaptation===
An eight-part [[The Foundation Trilogy (BBC Radio)|radio adaptation]] of the original trilogy, with sound design by the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 3]] in 1973 – one of the first BBC radio drama serials to be made in [[stereophonic sound|stereo]]. A [[BBC 7]] [[rerun]] commenced in July 2003.

Adapted by [[Patrick Tull]] (episodes 1 to 4) and Mike Stott (episodes 5 to 8), the dramatisation was directed by [[David Cain (composer)|David Cain]] and starred William Eedle as Hari Seldon, with [[Geoffrey Beevers]] as Gaal Dornick, [[Lee Montague]] as Salvor Hardin, [[Julian Glover]] as Hober Mallow, [[Dinsdale Landen]] as Bel Riose, [[Maurice Denham]] as Ebling Mis and [[Prunella Scales]] as Lady Callia.

===Film adaptation===
By 1998, [[New Line Cinema]] had spent $1.5&amp;nbsp;million developing a film version of the ''Foundation Trilogy''. The failure to develop a new franchise was partly a reason the studio signed on to produce [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sibley | first = Brian | authorlink = Brian Sibley | title = Peter Jackson: A Film-maker's Journey | publisher =Harpercollins | year =2006 | location =London | page =403 | isbn = 0-00-717558-2 |chapter=Three-Ring Circus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 2008, [[New Line Cinema]] co-founders [[Bob Shaye]] and [[Michael Lynne]] were reported to have been signed on to produce an adaptation of the trilogy by their company Unique Pictures for Warner Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Rich Drees| title = FOUNDATION Heading To Big Screen| publisher = Film Buff OnLine | date = 2008-07-29 | url = http://www.filmbuffonline.com/FBOLNewsreel/wordpress/?p=842/ | accessdate=2008-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, [[Columbia Pictures]] (Sony) successfully bid for the screen rights on January 15, 2009, and then contracted [[Roland Emmerich]] to direct and produce. Michael Wimer was named as co-producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0000386|Roland Emmerich}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two years later, the studio hired [[Dante Harper]] to adapt the books. This project failed to materialize and [[HBO]] acquired the rights when they became available in 2014.&lt;ref name="Sneider"&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Sneider |first1 = Jeff |title = 'Interstellar's' Jonah Nolan Developing 'Foundation' Series for HBO, WBTV (Exclusive) |website = [[TheWrap]] |url = http://www.thewrap.com/interstellars-jonah-nolan-developing-foundation-series-for-hbo-wbtv-exclusive/ |date = 10 November 2014 |accessdate = 11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books within the ''Foundation'' series==
===Overview===
The "Author's Note" of ''[[Prelude to Foundation]]'' contains the chronological ordering of Asimov's science fiction books, in which he also said, "they were not written in the order in which (perhaps) they should be read".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=Prelude to Foundation|year=1988|publisher=Bantam Dell|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-553-90095-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Forward the Foundation'' does not appear in Asimov's list, as it was not yet published at the time, and the order of the Empire novels in Asimov's list is not entirely consistent with other lists. For example, the 1983 [[Ballantine Books]] printing of ''[[The Robots of Dawn]]'' lists the Empire novels as: ''[[The Stars, Like Dust]], [[The Currents of Space]]'', and ''[[Pebble in the Sky]]''. Given that ''The Currents of Space'' includes Trantor and that ''The Stars, Like Dust'' does not, these two books possibly were accidentally reversed in Asimov's list.

Another alternative is to read the books in their original order of publication, since reading the ''Foundation'' prequels prior to reading the ''Foundation Trilogy'' fundamentally alters the original narrative structure of the trilogy by spoiling what were originally presented as plot surprises.{{original research inline|date=May 2011}} In that same ''Author's Note'', Asimov noted that there is room for a book between ''Robots and Empire (5)'' and ''The Currents of Space (6)'', and that he could follow ''Foundation and Earth (15)'' with additional volumes.

===Tangential books===
While not mentioned in the above list, the books ''[[The End of Eternity]]'' (1955) and ''[[Nemesis (Asimov)|Nemesis]]'' (1989) are also referenced in the series.

''The End of Eternity'' is vaguely referenced in ''Foundation's Edge'', where a character mentions the Eternals, whose "task it was to choose a [[reality]] that would be most suitable to Humanity". (''The End of Eternity'' also refers to a "Galactic Empire" within its story.) In ''Forward the Foundation'', Hari Seldon refers to a 20-thousand-year-old story of "a young woman that could communicate with an entire planet that circled a sun named Nemesis", a reference to ''Nemesis''. In ''Nemesis'', the main colony is one of the Fifty Settlements, a collection of orbital colonies that form a state. The Fifty Settlements possibly were the basis for the fifty Spacer worlds in the ''Robot'' stories. The implication at the end of ''Nemesis'' that the inhabitants of the off-Earth colonies are splitting off from Earthbound humans could also be connected to a similar implication about the Spacers in [[Mark W. Tiedemann]]'s ''Robot'' books.

On the other hand, these references might be just jokes by Asimov, and the stories mentioned could be just those really written by himself (as seen in ''The Robots of Dawn'', where Fastolfe makes a reference to Asimov's ''Liar!'') and still being read twenty thousand years later. Furthermore, Asimov himself did not mention ''The End of Eternity'' in the series listing from ''Prelude to Foundation''. As for ''Nemesis'', it was written after ''Prelude to Foundation'', but in the author's note Asimov explicitly states that the book is not part of the ''Foundation'' or ''Empire'' series, but that some day he might tie it to the others.

'''Gluconasturtiin''' ('''phenethylglucosinolate''') is one of the most widely distributed [[glucosinolate]]s in the [[cruciferous vegetables]], mainly in the roots, and is probably one of the plant compounds responsible for the natural pest-inhibiting properties of growing crucifers, such as cabbage, mustard or rape, in rotation with other crops. This effect of gluconasturtiin is most likely due to its degradation by the plant enzyme [[myrosinase]] into [[phenethyl isothiocyanate]], which is toxic to many organisms.

Gluconasturtiin is named from its occurrence in [[watercress]] (''Nasturtium officinale''). Among the vegetables, it is also found in [[horseradish]] (''Armoracia rusticana'') along with [[sinigrin]]. Both compounds elicit a [[pungent]] taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} RICHARD H. Arômes alimentaires [http://www.cnrs.fr/chimie/communication/images/images-chimietous/minidossiers/cours%20aromes_hubert%20richard.pdf PDF Document] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214074448/http://www.cnrs.fr/chimie/communication/images/images-chimietous/minidossiers/cours%20aromes_hubert%20richard.pdf |date=February 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one investigation of horseradish roots, sinigrin concentration represented 83% and gluconasturtiin 11% of the extracted glucosinolates.&lt;ref&gt; XIAN LI, KUSHAD MM (2004) Correlation of glucosinolate content to myrosinase activity in horseradish (Armoracia rusticana).''

[[File:Solomon's Temple, Museum für Hamburgische Geschichte, Hamburg, Germany IMG 5846 edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail]]
[[File:Villapando Temple Plan.jpg|upright|thumb|The floor plan of the Hamburg model corresponds to the lack of outdoor gallery from the plan of Juan Bautista Villalpando: : In Ezechielem Explanationes 1604.]]

The '''Hamburg temple model''' is a [[baroque]] architectural model of the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple of Solomon]]. It covers an area of about {{convert|12|m2|sqft}} and is made from wood. It is square, with four wings and nine courtyards, two of them in the central axis.

It was made from 1680 to 1692 after being commissioned by the [[Hamburg]] senator and founder and director of the [[Hamburg Opera]], [[Gerhard Schott]]. The model was first exhibited at the Hamburg Opera. After his death, Schott's heirs put the model up for sale in London, where it was acquired by an agent of [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I]], [[King of Poland]]. In 1732 it was taken to [[Dresden]], where it was shown as part of the collection of [[Jewish ceremonial art]]. After the restructuring of this collection in the early 19th Century the model had several owners, before being acquired by the [[Hamburgmuseum]] in 1910.

Schott's model is in the tradition of many Renaissance and Baroque attempts at reconstruction of the temple by theological and architectural scholars.&lt;!--  considerations examined the original shape of the temple described in the Bible to approach. While most of the experiments were published independently in written or graphic form, is not original bulkhead model.--&gt; The Hamburg-based model closely follows an interpretation by the Spanish Jesuit [[Juan Bautista Villalpando]] in 1604, in turn, based on the [[Third Temple]] described in the [[Book of Ezekiel]].

The reason the expensive and complex model was commissioned is unknown.

== Biography ==
Billing was born in Salzwedel, in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. After studying mathematics and physics in University of Göttingen he received his doctorate in 1938 in Munich at the age of 24.

On 3 October 1943 he married Anneliese Oetker. Billing has three children: Heiner Erhard Billing (born November 18, 1944 in Salzwedel), Dorit Gerda Gronefeld Billing (born 27 June 1946 in Göttingen) and Arend Gerd Billing (born 19 September 1954 in Göttingen).

==Computer science==
Billing worked at the Aerodynamic Research Institute in [[Göttingen]], where he developed a [[magnetic drum memory]].

According to Billing's memoirs, published by Genscher, Düsseldorf (1997), there was a meeting between [[Alan Turing]] and [[Konrad Zuse]].&lt;ref name="leeds"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mathcomp.leeds.ac.uk/turing2012/Images/Turing_Zuse.pdf |title=Did Alan Turing interrogate Konrad Zuse in Göttingen in 1947?|author=Herbert Bruderer|accessdate= 21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took place in [[Göttingen]] in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were [[John R. Womersley|Womersley]], Turing, Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse, Walther, and Billing. (For more details see Herbert Bruderer, ''Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz'').

After a brief stay at the [[University of Sydney]], Billing returned to join the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics]] in 1951. From 1952 through 1961 the group under Billing's direction constructed a series of four digital computers: the G1, G2, G1a, and G3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rojas |first1=Raúl |last2=Hashagen |first2=Ulf |title=The First Computers: History and Architectures |date=2002 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-68137-7 |pages=295,312 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nDWPW9uwZPAC&amp;lpg=PA295&amp;dq=%22G3%22%20computer&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA295#v=onepage&amp;q=%22G3%22%20computer&amp;f=false |language=en |chapter=The G1 and the Göttingen Family of Digital Computers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the designer of the first German sequence-controlled electronic digital computer as well as of the first German stored-program electronic digital computer.&lt;ref name="leeds"/&gt;

==Gravitational wave detector==
After transistors had been firmly established, when microelectronics arrived, after scientific computers were slowly overshadowed by commercial applications and computers were mass-produced in factories, Heinz Billing left the computer field in which he had been a pioneer for nearly 30 years.&lt;ref name="IEEE"/&gt;

In 1972, Billing returned to his original field of physics, at the Max Planck Institute's new location at Garching near Munich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://joern.de/Billing.pdf |title=Wer? |trans-title=Who? (Heinz Billing on magnetic storage drum) |language=de }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1972, Heinz Billing became involved in gravitational physics, when he tried to verify the detection claims made by American physicist [[Joseph Weber]]. Weber's results were considered to be proven wrong by these experiments.&lt;ref name="geo600"/&gt;

In 1975, Billing acted on a proposal by [[Rainer Weiss]] from the Massachusetts Institute of technology (MIT) to use laser interferometry to detect gravitational waves. He and colleagues built a 3m prototype Michelson interferometer using optical delay lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Laser interferometry for the detection of gravitational waves|author1=Jim Hough |author2=[[Sheila Rowan (physicist)|Sheila Rowan]] |journal=Journal of Optics A: Pure and Applied Optics|url=http://www.astro.umd.edu/~miller/Compact/hough05.pdf|year=2005|volume=7|page=S257-S264|doi=10.1088/1464-4258/7/6/001|bibcode=2005JOptA...7S.257H}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1980 onward Billing commissioned the development and construction in MPA in Garching of a laser interferometer with an arm length of 30m. Without the knowledge gained from this prototype, the LIGO project would not have been started when it did.&lt;ref name="geo600"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mit.edu/2016/rainer-weiss-ligo-origins-0211|title=Q&amp;A: Rainer Weiss on LIGO’s origins|publisher=news.mit.edu|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In memoriam Jürgen Ehlers|url=http://priorwww.aei.mpg.de/ehlers/en/RedeRuediger.pdf|author=Albrecht Rüdiger|publisher=aei.mpg.de|accessdate=21 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221033028/http://priorwww.aei.mpg.de/ehlers/en/RedeRuediger.pdf|archivedate=21 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An argon laser interferometer for the detection of gravitational radiation|author1=H.

==Awards and honors==
In 1987, Heinz Billing received the [[Konrad Zuse Medal]] for the invention of [[Drum memory|magnetic drum storage]]. In 2015 he received the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]].

In 1993, the annual [[Heinz Billing prize]] for "outstanding contributions to computational science" was established by the [[Max Planck Society]] in his honor, with a prize amount of 5000 Euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Heinz Billing Prize for the Advancement of Scientific computing|publisher=MPG|url=http://www.billingpreis.mpg.de/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Integrated discrete Multiple Organ Culture (IdMOC)''' is an ''in vitro'', cell culture based experimental model for the study of [[intercellular communication]].  In conventional ''in vitro'' systems, each cell type is studied in isolation ignoring critical interactions between organs or cell types. IdMOC technology is based on the concept that multiple organs signal or communicate via the systemic circulation (i.e., blood).
[[File:IdMOC.JPG|thumb|right|Schematic representation of an IdMOC plate]]
The IdMOC plate consists of multiple inner wells within a large interconnecting chamber. Multiple cell types are first individually seeded in the inner wells and, when required, are flooded with an overlying medium to facilitate well-to-well communication. Test material can be added to the overlying medium and both media and cells can be analyzed individually. Plating of [[hepatocytes]] with other organ-specific cells allows evaluation of [[drug metabolism]] and organotoxicity.&lt;ref&gt;Li AP, Bode C, Sakai Y. A novel in vitro system, the integrated discrete multiple organ cell culture (IdMOC) system, for the evaluation of human drug toxicity: comparative cytotoxicity of tamoxifen towards normal human cells from five major organs and MCF-7 adenocarcinoma breast cancer cells. Chem Biol Interact. 2004 Nov 1;150(1):129-36&lt;/ref&gt;

The IdMOC system has numerous applications in [[drug development]], such as the evaluation of [[drug metabolism]] and [[toxicity]]. It can simultaneously evaluate the toxic potential of a drug on cells from multiple organs and evaluate drug stability, distribution, metabolite formation, and efficacy. By modeling multiple-organ interactions, IdMOC can examine the [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] effects of a drug and its metabolites on target and off-target organs as well as evaluate [[drug interactions|drug-drug interactions]] by measuring [[cytochrome P450]] (CYP) induction or inhibition in hepatocytes.

IdMOC can also be used for routine and [[high throughput screening]] of drugs with desirable [[ADME]] or [[ADME-Tox]] properties. [[In vitro toxicology|In vitro toxicity]] screening using hepatocytes in conjunction with other primary cells such as cardiomyocytes ([[cardiotoxicity]] model), kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells ([[nephrotoxicity]] model), astrocytes ([[neurotoxicity]] model), endothelial cells (vascular toxicity model), and airway epithelial cells ([[pulmonary toxicity]] model) is invaluable to the [[drug design]] and [[drug discovery|discovery]] process.&lt;ref&gt;Li, AP. In vitro evaluation of metabolic drug-drug interactions: a descriptive and critical commentary. [[Current Protocols]] in Toxicology 2007 33:4.25.1-4.25.11&lt;/ref&gt;

The IdMOC was patented by Dr. Albert P. Li in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = United States Patent: 7186548 - Cell culture tool and method|url = http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%252Fnetahtml%252FPTO%252Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=7186548.PN.&amp;OS=PN/7186548&amp;RS=PN/7186548|accessdate = 2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1980s, [[database]]s were viewed as computer systems that stored record-oriented and business data such as manufacturing inventories, bank records, and sales transactions. A database system was not expected to merge numeric data with text, images, or [[multimedia]] information, nor was it expected to automatically notice patterns in the data it stored. In the late 1980s the concept of an '''intelligent database''' was put forward as a system that manages information (rather than data) in a way that appears natural to users and which goes beyond simple record keeping.

The term was introduced in 1989 by the book ''Intelligent Databases'' by [[Kamran Parsaye]], [[Mark Chignell]], Setrag Khoshafian and [[Harry Wong]]. The concept postulated three levels of intelligence for such systems: high level tools, the [[user interface]] and the [[database engine]]. The high level tools manage data quality and automatically discover relevant patterns in the data with a process called [[data mining]]. This layer often relies on the use of [[artificial intelligence]] techniques. The user interface uses [[hypermedia]] in a form that uniformly manages text, images and numeric data. The intelligent database engine supports the other two layers, often merging [[relational database]] techniques with [[object-oriented programming|object orientation]].

In the twenty-first century, intelligent databases have now become widespread, e.g. hospital databases can now call up patient histories consisting of charts, text and x-ray images just with a few mouse clicks, and many corporate databases include [[decision support]] tools based on sales pattern analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5365">An '''intelligent decision support system''' (IDSS) is a [[decision support system]] that makes extensive use of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) techniques. Use of AI techniques in [[management information systems]] has a long history – indeed terms such as "[[Knowledge-based systems]]" (KBS) and "intelligent systems" have been used since the early 1980s to describe components of management systems, but the term "Intelligent decision support system" is thought to originate with Clyde Holsapple and [[Andrew B. Whinston|Andrew Whinston]]&lt;ref&gt;Holsapple C.: Framework for a generalized intelligent decision support system (1977) PhD Thesis Purdue University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holsapple C. &amp; Whinston A.: Business expert systems (1987) McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1970s. Examples of specialized intelligent decision support systems include [[Flexible manufacturing system]]s (FMS),&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Jiang &amp; Tang: The development of intelligent decision support tools to aid the design of flexible manufacturing systems (2000). International Journal of Production Economics, 65, 73-84&lt;/ref&gt; intelligent marketing decision support systems&lt;ref&gt;Matsatsinis and Siskos (2002), Intelligent support systems for marketing decisions, Kluwer Academic Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; and medical diagnosis systems.&lt;ref&gt;Walker D.: Similarity Determination and Case Retrieval in an Intelligent Decision Support System for Diabetes Management, MSCS Thesis, Ohio University, Computer Science (Engineering), 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideally, an intelligent decision support system should behave like a human consultant: [[decision support|supporting decision makers]] by gathering and analysing evidence, identifying and diagnosing problems, proposing possible courses of action and evaluating such proposed actions.  The aim of the AI techniques embedded in an intelligent decision support system is to enable these tasks to be performed by a computer, while emulating human capabilities as closely as possible.

Many IDSS implementations are based on [[expert systems]],&lt;ref&gt;Matsatsinis, N.F., Y. Siskos (1999), MARKEX: An intelligent decision support system for product development decisions, European Journal of Operational Research, vol. 113, no. 2, pp. 336-354&lt;/ref&gt; a well established type of KBS that encode knowledge and emulate the cognitive behaviours of human experts using predicate logic rules, and have been shown to perform better than the original human experts in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Baron J.: Thinking and Deciding (1998) Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turban E., Volonio L., McLean E. and Wetherbe J.: Information Technology for Management (2009) Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; [[Expert systems]] emerged as practical applications in the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;Jackson P.: Introduction to expert systems (1986) Addison-Wesley&lt;/ref&gt; based on research in artificial intelligence performed during the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Power, D.J. [http://DSSResources.COM/history/dsshistory.html A Brief History of Decision Support Systems], DSSResources.COM, World Wide Web, version 4.0, March 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; They typically combine knowledge of a particular application domain with an [[inference]] capability to enable the system to propose decisions or diagnoses. Accuracy and consistency can be comparable to (or even exceed) that of human experts when the decision parameters are well known (e.g. if a common disease is being diagnosed), but performance can be poor when novel or uncertain circumstances arise.

Research in AI focused on enabling systems to respond to novelty and uncertainty in more flexible ways is starting to be used in IDSS. For example, [[intelligent agent]]s&lt;ref&gt;Sugumaran V.: Application of Agents and Intelligent Information Technologies (2007) IGI Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matsatsinis, N.F., P. Moraϊtis, V. Psomatakis, N. Spanoudakis (2003), An Agent-Based System for Products Penetration Strategy Selection, Applied Artificial Intelligence: An International Journal, vol. 17, no. 10, pp. 901-925&lt;/ref&gt; that perform complex [[cognition|cognitive tasks]] without any need for human intervention have been used in a range of decision support applications.&lt;ref&gt;Tung Bui, Jintae Lee, An agent-based framework for building decision support systems, Decision Support Systems, Volume 25, Issue 3, April 1999, Pages 225-237, ISSN 0167-9236, {{DOI|10.1016/S0167-9236(99)00008-1}}.

&lt;/ref&gt; Capabilities of  these intelligent agents include [[KQML|knowledge sharing]],  [[machine learning]], [[data mining]], and automated [[inference]]. A range of AI techniques such as [[case based reasoning]], [[rough set]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://idss.cs.put.poznan.pl/site/research.html Laboratory of intelligent decision support systems, Poznan]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[fuzzy logic]] have also been used to enable decision support systems to perform better in uncertain conditions.

In the [[visual arts]], '''interlace''' is a decorative element found in  [[medieval art]]. In interlace, bands or portions of other [[motif (visual arts)|motif]]s are looped, [[braid]]ed, and [[knot]]ted in complex [[geometry|geometric]] patterns, often to fill a space. Interlacing is common in the [[Migration period art]] of [[Northern Europe]], especially in the [[Insular art]] of Ireland and the British Isles and [[Norse art]] of the [[Early Middle Ages]] and in [[Islamic interlace patterns|Islamic art]].

Intricate braided and interlaced patterns, called ''plaits'' in British usage, are found in late [[Roman art]] in many parts of Europe, in [[mosaic]] floors and other media.  [[Coptic art|Coptic manuscripts and textiles]] of 5th- and 6th-century Christian Egypt are decorated with broad-strand ribbon interlace ornament bearing a "striking resemblance" to the earliest types of knotwork found in the [[Insular art]] manuscripts of Ireland and the  [[British Isles]].&lt;ref name="M1"&gt;Mitchell et al. 1977, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and application==

[[File:Torque de Foxados - Detalle.JPG|thumb|left|Interlace and [[rotational symmetry]]: Iron Age ''Torque de Foxados'', Museo de [[Pontevedra]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]]]

===Northern Europe===
Interlace is a key feature of the "Style II" [[animal style]] decoration of Migration Period art, and is found widely across Northern Europe, and was carried by the [[Lombards]] into Northern Italy.  Typically the long "ribbons" eventually terminate in an animal's head.  By about 700 it becomes less common in most of Europe, but continues to develop in the British Isles and [[Scandinavia]], where it is found on metalwork, woodcarving, [[runestone]]s, [[high cross]]es, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the 7th to 12th centuries.  Artist [[George Bain (artist)|George Bain]] has characterised the early Insular knotwork found in the 7th-century [[Book of Durrow]] and the [[Durham Cathedral]] [[Gospel Book Fragment (Durham Cathedral Library, A. II. 10.)|Gospel Book fragment]] as "broken and rejoined" braids.&lt;ref&gt;Bain 1973, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Coptic braid patterns were transmitted directly to [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Hiberno-Scottish]] [[monastery|monasteries]] from the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] or came via [[Lombards|Lombardic]] Italy is uncertain.&lt;ref name="M1" /&gt; Art historian [[James Johnson Sweeney]] argued for direct communication between the [[scriptorium|scriptoria]] of [[Early history of Ireland|Early Christian Ireland]] and the Coptic monasteries of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop 2001, p.270&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
This new style featured elongated beasts intertwined into symmetrical shapes, and can be dated to the mid-7th century based on the accepted dating of examples in the [[Sutton Hoo]] treasure.&lt;ref name="M1" /&gt;   The most elaborate interlaced [[zoomorphism|zoomorphics]] occur in [[Viking Age]] art of the [[Urnes style]] (arising before 1050), where tendrils of foliate designs intertwine with the stylized animals.&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Campbell 1980, pp. 150-151&lt;/ref&gt;

The full-flowering of Northern European interlace occurred in the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, where the animal style ornament of Northern Europe blended with ribbon knotwork and Christian influences in such works as the ''[[Book of Kells]]'' and the [[Cross of Cong]].&lt;ref name="M1" /&gt;  Whole [[carpet page]]s were illuminated with abstract patterns, including much use of interlace, and stone [[high cross]]es combined interlace panels with figurative ones.  Insular interlace was copied in continental Europe, closely in the [[Franco-Saxon school]] of the 8th to 11th centuries, and less so in other [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] schools of illumination, where the tendency was to [[foliage|foliate]] decorative forms.  In [[Romanesque art]] these became typical, and the interlace generally much less complex.  Some animal forms are also found.

===Islamic art===
{{main|Islamic interlace patterns}}
Geometric interlacing patterns are common in Islamic ornament. They can be considered a particular type of [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]. [[Umayyad architecture|Umayyad architectural]] elements such as floor [[mosaics]], window grilles, carvings and wall paintings, and decorative metal work of the 8th to 10th centuries are followed by the intricate interlacings common in later medieval [[Islamic art]]. Interlaced elaborations are also found in [[Kufic]] [[calligraphy]].

===Southern Europe===
Interlace and knotwork are often found in [[Byzantine art]], continuing Roman usage, but they are not given great prominence. One notable example of a widespread local usage of interlace is the [[Croatian wattle|three-ribbon interlace]] found in the [[Early middle ages|early]] [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|medieval Croatia]] on stone carvings from the 9th to 11th centuries.

A '''line shaft''' is a power driven rotating shaft for [[power transmission]] that was used extensively from the [[Industrial Revolution]] until the early 20th century. Prior to the widespread use of [[electric motor]]s small enough to be connected directly to each piece of machinery, line shafting was used to distribute [[power (physics)|power]] from a large central power source to machinery throughout a workshop or an industrial complex.  The central power source could be a [[water wheel]], turbine, windmill, animal power or a [[steam engine]].  Power was distributed from the shaft to the machinery by a system of [[belt (mechanical)|belt]]s, [[pulley]]s and gears known as ''millwork''.&lt;ref name = "Hunter 1991"/&gt;

==Operation==
[[File:Lineshaft drive to lathe, with stepped pulleys for variable speed (Carpentry and Joinery, 1925).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Variable speed belt drive for a [[lathe]]. The fixed pulley on the upper shaft is driven at constant speed by a belt from the power source. The loose pulley ('idler') allows the machine to be stopped in isolation – necessary for changing speed. The stepped pulleys (left) provide three drive speeds for the machine tool (not shown), depending on which pair of pulleys is connected by the belt.]]

A typical line shaft would be suspended from the ceiling of one area and would run the length of that area. One [[pulley]] on the shaft would receive the power from a parent line shaft elsewhere in the building. The other pulleys would supply power to pulleys on each individual machine or to subsequent line shafts. In manufacturing where there were a large number of machines performing the same tasks, the design of the system was fairly regular and repeated. In other applications such as machine and wood shops where there was a variety of machines with different orientations and power requirements, the system would appear erratic and inconsistent with many different shafting directions and pulley sizes. Shafts were usually horizontal and overhead but occasionally were vertical and could be underground. Shafts were usually rigid steel, made up of several parts bolted together at flanges. The shafts were suspended by hangers with bearings at certain intervals of length. The distance depended on the weight of the shaft and the number of pulleys. The shafts had to be kept aligned or the stress would overheat the bearings and could break the shaft. The bearings were usually [[Friction bearing|friction]] type and had to be kept lubricated. Pulley lubricator employees were required in order to ensure that the bearings did not freeze or malfunction.

In the earliest applications power was transmitted between pulleys using loops of rope on grooved pulleys. This method is extremely rare today, dating mostly from the 18th century. Flat [[Belt (mechanical)|belts]] on flat pulleys or drums were the most common method during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The belts were generally tanned leather or [[cotton duck]] impregnated with rubber. Leather belts were fastened in loops with rawhide or wire lacing, lap joints and glue, or one of several types of steel fasteners. Cotton duck belts usually used metal fasteners or were melted together with heat. The leather belts were run with the hair side against the pulleys for best traction. The belts needed periodic cleaning and conditioning to keep them in good condition. Belts were often twisted 180 degrees per leg and reversed on the receiving pulley to cause the second shaft to rotate in the opposite direction.

Pulleys were constructed of wood, iron, steel or a combination thereof. Varying sizes of pulleys were used in conjunction to change the speed of rotation. For example a 40" pulley at 100 rpm would turn a 20" pulley at 200 rpm. Pulleys solidly attached ("fast") to the shaft could be combined with adjacent pulleys that turned freely ("loose") on the shaft (idlers). In this configuration the belt could be maneuvered onto the idler to stop power transmission or onto the solid pulley to convey the power. This arrangement was often used near machines to provide a means of shutting the machine off when not in use. Usually at the last belt feeding power to a machine, a pair of stepped pulleys could be used to give a variety of speed settings for the machine.

Occasionally gears were used between shafts to change speed rather than belts and different sized pulleys, but this seems to have been relatively uncommon.

==History==
Early versions of line shafts date back into the 18th century, but they were in widespread use in the late 19th century with industrialization.  Line shafts were widely used in manufacturing, woodworking shops, machine shops, saw mills and [[Gristmill|grist mills]].

In 1828 in Lowell, Massachusetts, [[Paul Moody (inventor)|Paul Moody]] substituted leather belting for metal gearing to transfer power from the main shaft running from a water wheel. This innovation quickly spread in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Flat belt drive systems became popular in the UK from the 1870s, with the firms of [[J &amp; E Wood]] and [[W &amp; J Galloway &amp; Sons]] prominent in their introduction. Both of these firms manufactured stationary steam engines and the continuing demand for more power and reliability could be met not merely by improved engine technology but also improved methods of transferring power from the engines to the looms and similar machinery which they were intended to service. The use of flat belts was already common in the US but rare in Britain until this time. The advantages included less noise and less wasted energy in the friction losses inherent in the previously common drive shafts and their associated gearing. Also, maintenance was simpler and cheaper, and it was a more convenient method for the arrangement of power drives such that if one part were to fail then it would not cause loss of power to all sections of a factory or mill. These systems were in turn superseded in popularity by rope drive methods.&lt;ref name="Hills208"&gt;[[#Hills|Hills]] pp.208-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the 19th century some factories had a mile or more of line shafts in a single building.

In order to provide power for small shops and light industry, specially constructed "power buildings" were constructed.  Power buildings used a central steam engine and distributed power through line shafts to all the leased rooms.  Power buildings continued to be built in the early days of electrification, still using line shafts but driven by an electric motor.&lt;ref name = "Hunter 1991"/&gt;

As some factories grew too large and complex to be powered by a single steam engine, a system of "sub divided" power came into use.  This was also important when a wide range of speed control was necessary for a sensitive operation such as wire drawing or hammering iron.  Under sub divided power, steam was piped from a central boiler to smaller steam engines located where needed.  However, small steam engines were much less efficient than large ones.  The [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] 63 acre site changed to sub divided power, then because of the inefficiency converted to group drive with several large steam engines driving the line shafts.  Eventually Baldwin converted to electric drive, with a substantial saving in labor and building space.&lt;ref name = "Hunter 1991"&gt;

With factory [[electrification]] in the early 1900s, many line shafts began converting to electric drive. In early factory electrification only large motors were available, so new factories installed a large motor to drive line shafting and millwork.  After 1900 smaller industrial motors became available and most new installations used individual electric drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology |last=Nye |first=David E. |authorlink= |year=1990 |publisher= [[MIT Press]] |location= Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England |isbn= |pages=14, 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steam turbine powered line shafts were commonly used to drive [[paper machine]]s for speed control reasons until economical methods for precision electric motor speed control became available in the 1980s; since then many have been replaced with sectional electric drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}} (Article has photo of line shaft and turbine.)&lt;/ref&gt;  Economical variable speed control using electric motors was made possible by [[silicon controlled rectifier]]s (SCRs) to produce direct current and variable frequency drives using [[Power inverter|inverters]] to change DC back to AC at the frequency required for the desired speed.

Most systems were out of service by the mid-20th century and relatively few remain in the 21st century, even fewer in their original location and configuration.

==Disadvantages and alternatives==

===Disadvantages===
Compared to individual electric motor or ''unit'' drive, line shafts have the following disadvantages: &lt;ref name = "Hunter 1991"/&gt;
*Power loss with line shafts varied widely and was typically 25% and often much higher; however, using [[Rolling-element bearing|roller bearings]] and good quality lubrication could minimize losses.  Roller and spherical bearings gained acceptance in the decade before electrification of factories began.
*Continuous noise  
*Maintenance costs were higher.
*The systems were more dangerous.
*Down time due to mechanical problems was higher.
*It was not as easy to change speed.
*Factory layout was designed around access to the line shafts, not in the most efficient manner for the work flow.
*The line shafts and millwork took up a lot of space; Baldwin Locomotive Works estimated 40% more than electric drive.
*The shafts and belting were in the way of lighting, overhead cranes and ventilation ducts.  
*Alignment of the system was critical and problematic for long shafts that were subject to expansion and contraction, settling and vibration.
*The belting shed dust and kept it continuously circulating in the air.
*Oil dripped from the overhead shafting.

Firms switching to electric power showed significantly less employee sick time, and, using the same equipment, showed significant increases in production.

&lt;blockquote&gt;“We can scarcely step into a shop or factory of any description without encountering a mass of belts which seem at first to monopolize every nook in the building and leave little or no room for anything else”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Historical alternatives to line shafts===
To overcome the distance and friction limitations of line shafts, wire rope systems were developed in the late 19th century. Wire rope operated at higher velocities than line shafts and were a practical means of transmitting mechanical power for a distance of a few miles or kilometers.  They used widely spaced, large diameter wheels and had much lower friction loss than line shafts, and had one-tenth the initial cost.

To supply small scale power that was impractical for individual steam engines, central station hydraulic systems were developed.  Hydraulic power was used to operate cranes and other machinery in British ports and elsewhere in Europe.  The largest hydraulic system was in London. Hydraulic power was used extensively in [[Bessemer process|Bessemer]] steel production

There were also some central stations providing pneumatic power in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name = "Hunter 1991"/&gt;

The first newspapers appeared in major port cities such as Philadelphia, New York, Boston, and Charleston in order to provide merchants with the latest trade news. They typically copied any news that was received from other newspapers, or from the London press. The editors discovered they could criticize the local governor and gain a bigger audience; the governor discovered he could shut down the newspapers. The most dramatic confrontation came in New York in 1734, where the governor brought [[John Peter Zenger]] to trial for criminal libel after his paper published some  satirical attacks. Zenger's lawyers argued that truth was a defense against libel and the jury acquitted Zenger, who became the iconic American hero for freedom of the press.  The result was an emerging tension between the media and the government.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Olson, "The Zenger Case Revisited: Satire, Sedition and Political Debate in Eighteenth Century America." ''Early American Literature'' (2000) 35#3 pp: 223-245. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/eal/summary/v035/35.3olson.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; Literacy was widespread in America, with over half of the white men able to read. The illiterates often could hear newspapers read aloud at local taverns. By the mid-1760s, there were 24 weekly newspapers in the 13 colonies (only New Jersey was lacking one), and the satirical attack on government became common practice in American newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Copeland, Colonial American Newspapers: Character and Content'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William David Sloan, and Julie Williams, ''The Early American Press, 1690-1783'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The French and Indian war (1757–63) was the featured topic of many newspaper stories, giving the colonials a broader view of American affairs. [[Benjamin Franklin]], already famous as a printer in Philadelphia published one of the first editorial cartoons, ''[[Join, or Die]]'', calling on the colonies to join together to defeat the French. By reprinting news originating in other papers, colonial printers created a private network for evaluating and disseminating news for the whole colonial world. Franklin took the lead, and eventually had two dozen newspapers in his network.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Frasca, "Benjamin Franklin's Printing Network and the Stamp Act," ''Pennsylvania History'' (2004) 71#3 pp. 403-419 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27778636  in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The network played a major role in organizing opposition to the Stamp Act, and in organizing and embolding the Patriots in the 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;David Copeland,  "'Join, or die': America's press during the French and Indian War." ''Journalism History'' (1998) 24#3 pp: 112-23 [http://search.proquest.com/openview/73184dced3cd49c14fdb5574c6612884/1?pq-origsite=gscholar online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonial newspaper networks played a major role in fomenting the American Revolution, starting with their attack on the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur M. Schlesinger, "The colonial newspapers and the Stamp Act." ''New England Quarterly'' (1935) 8#1 pp: 63-83. [http://www.oakton.edu/user/1/jholderf/American%20History%203.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; They provided essential news of what was happening locally and in other colonies, and they provided the arguments used by the patriots, to Voice their grievances such as "No taxation without representation!"&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Merritt, "Public Opinion in Colonial America: Content Analyzing the Colonial Press." ''Public Opinion Quarterly''  (1963) 27#3 pp: 356-371. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2747114 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  The newspapers also printed and sold pamphlets, such as the phenomenally successful ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' (1776), which destroyed the king's prestige and jelled Patriot opinion overnight in favor of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop D. Jordan, "Familial Politics: Thomas Paine and the Killing of the King, 1776." ''Journal of American History'' (1973): 294-308. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2936777 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Neutrality became impossible, and the few Loyalist newspapers were hounded and ceased publication when the war began. However, the British controlled important cities for varying periods of time, including New York City, 1776 to 1783. They sponsored a Loyalist press that vanished in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Mott, ''American Journalism: A History, 1690-1960'' pp 79-94&lt;/ref&gt;

== New nation, 1780s–1820s==
{{main|First Party System}}
[[File:~party3.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Federalist poster about 1800. Washington (in heaven) tells partisans to keep the pillars of Federalism, Republicanism and Democracy]]
With the formation of the first two political parties in the  1790s, Both parties set up national networks of newspapers to provide a flow of partisan news and information for their supporters.  The newspapers also printed pamphlets, flyers, and ballots that voters could simply drop in the ballot box.

By 1796, both parties had a national network of newspapers, which attacked each other vehemently.  The [[History of American newspapers|Federalist and Republican newspapers]] of the 1790s traded vicious barbs against their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Daniel, ''Scandal and Civility: Journalism and the Birth of
American Democracy'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most heated rhetoric came in debates over the French Revolution, especially the [[Jacobin#The Terror|Jacobin Terror]] of 1793–94 when the guillotine was used daily.  Nationalism was a high priority, and the editors fostered an intellectual nationalism typified by the Federalist effort to stimulate a national literary culture through their clubs and publications in New York and Philadelphia, and through Federalist [[Noah Webster]]'s efforts to simplify and Americanize the language.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine O'Donnell Kaplan, ''Men of Letters in the Early Republic: Cultivating Forms of Citizenship'' 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of political passion came in 1798 as the Federalists in Congress passed the four [[Alien and Sedition Acts]]. The fourth Act made it a federal crime to publish "any false, scandalous, or malicious writing or writings against the Government of the United States, with intent to defame... Or to bring them... into contempt or disrepute." Two dozen men were charged with felonies for violating the  Sedition Act, chiefly newspaper editors from the Jeffersonian Republican Party. The act expired in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Berns, "Freedom of the Press and the Alien and Sedition Laws: A Reappraisal," ''Supreme Court Review'' (1970) pp. 109-159
[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3108724 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second Party System: 1830s–1850s==
{{main|History of American newspapers#The press in the Party System: 1820–1890}}
Both parties relied heavily on their national network of newspapers. Some editors were the key political players in their states, and most of them filled their papers with useful information on rallies and speeches and candidates, as well as the text of major speeches and campaign platforms.

== Third Party System: 1850s–1890s==
{{main|Third Party System}}
Newspapers continued their role as the main internal communication system for the Army-style campaigns of the era. The goal was not to convince independents, who are few in number, but to rally all the loyal party members to the polls by making them enthusiastic about the party's platform, and apprehensive about the enemy.

Nearly all weekly and daily papers were party organs until the early 20th century. Thanks to Hoe's invention of high-speed rotary presses for city papers, and free postage for rural sheets, newspapers proliferated. In 1850, the Census counted 1,630 party newspapers (with a circulation of about one per voter), and only 83 "independent" papers. The party line was behind every line of news copy, not to mention the authoritative editorials, which exposed the 'stupidity' of the enemy and the 'triumphs' of the party in every issue. Editors were senior party leaders, and often were rewarded with lucrative postmasterships. Top publishers, such as [[Horace Greeley]], [[Whitelaw Reid]], [[Schuyler Colfax]], [[Warren Harding]] and [[James M. Cox|James Cox]] were nominated on the national ticket. After 1900, [[William Randolph Hearst]], [[Joseph Pulitzer]] and other big city politician-publishers discovered they could make far more profit through advertising, at so many dollars per thousand readers. By becoming non-partisan they expanded their base to include the opposition party and the fast-growing number of consumers who read the ads but were less and less interested in politics. There was less and less political news after 1900, apparently because citizens became more apathetic, and shared their partisan loyalties with the new professional sports teams that attracted larger and larger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lee Kaplan, ''Politics and the American press: the rise of objectivity, 1865-1920'' (2002) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark W. Summers, ''The Press Gang: Newspapers and Politics, 1865-1878'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Progressive era==
{{main|Fourth Party System|Muckraker}}
The American Newspaper industry during this era had been massively expanding. The number of English-language newspapers had nearly tripled during this time. Technology had a hand to do with this because of faster printing presses, and more efficient transportation. Newspapers such as the New York World and the New York Journal appealed to a wide variety of audiences with pages devoted to finances, sports, women, entertainment, etc. Special Interest newspapers were also on the rise during this period with many different groups pushing their agenda through newspapers and other forms of media. These special interest newspapers include the National American Woman Suffrage Association's Woman's Journal, The Anti-Saloon League's American Issue, and others. There even came a time that there was up to nine publications in the major cities such as Chicago, Boston, and New York which in turn created fierce competition. Competition caused these publications to lower their prices to just a penny just to stay afloat. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Progressive Era: Primary Documents on Events from 1890 to 1914|last=Burt|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2004|isbn=0313320977|location=West-port,CT|pages=7-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magazines were not a new medium but they became much more popular around 1900, some with circulations in the hundreds of thousands of subscribers.  Thanks to the rapid expansion of national advertising, the cover price fell sharply to about 10 cents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter C. Holloran et al. eds.|title=The A to Z of the Progressive Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rt3243E-Wm0C&amp;pg=PA266|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; One cause was the heavy coverage of corruption in politics, local government and big business, especially by ''Muckrakers.''  They were journalists in the [[Progressive Era]] (1890s-1920s) who wrote for popular magazines to expose social and political sins and shortcomings. They relied on their own  [[investigative journalism]] reporting; muckrakers often worked to expose social ills and corporate and [[Corruption in the United States|political corruption]]. Muckraking magazines–notably ''[[McClure's]]''–took on corporate monopolies and crooked [[political machine]]s while raising public awareness of chronic urban poverty, unsafe working conditions, and [[social issues]] like [[child labor]].  These Journalists were nicknamed muckrakers by Theodore Roosevelt because he complained they were being disruptive by raking up the muck.
&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Shapiro,  ed., ''The muckrakers and American society'' (Heath, 1968), contains representative samples as well as academic commentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ray Stannard Baker]], [[George Creel]], and [[Brand Whitlock]] specialized in exposing corruption at the state and local levels. [[Lincoln Steffens]] went after corruption in big cities. [[Ida Tarbell]] attacked John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company. Most of the muckrakers wrote nonfiction, but fictional exposes often had a major impact as well, such as those by [[Upton Sinclair]].  He is best known for exposing the corrupt meatpacking industry and the horrific working conditions of men working in these factories and the contamination in the meat.&lt;ref&gt;Judson A. Grenier, "Muckraking the muckrakers: Upton Sinclair and his peers." in  David R Colburn and Sandra Pozzetta, eds., ''Reform and Reformers in the Progressive Era '' (1983) pp: 71-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Deal era ==
{{main|Fifth Party System|New Deal Coalition}}
Most of the major newspapers in the larger cities were owned by conservative publishers and they turned hostile to liberal President [[Franklin D Roosevelt]] by 1934 or so, including major chains run by [[William Randolph Hearst]]. Roosevelt turned to radio, where he could reach more listeners more directly. During previous election campaigns , the parties sponsored nationwide broadcasts of major speeches. Roosevelt, however, gave intimate talks, person-to-person, as if he were in the same room sitting next to the fireplace. His rhetorical technique was extraordinarily effective. However, it proved very hard to duplicate. Young [[Ronald Reagan]], beginning a career in as a radio broadcaster and Hollywood star, was one of the few to match the right tone, nuance, and intimacy that Roosevelt had introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas B. Craig, ''Fireside Politics: Radio and Political Culture in the United States, 1920-1940'' (2005) [https://www.amazon.com/Fireside-Politics-Political-1920-1940-Reconfiguring-ebook/dp/B007RKNUR6/  excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

In peacetime, [[Freedom of the press]] was not an issue for newspapers. However radio presented the new issue, for the government control the airwaves and licensed them. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] ruled in the "Mayflower decision" in 1941 against the broadcasting of any editorial opinion, although political parties could still purchase airtime for their own speeches and programs. This policy was replaced in 1949 by the "[[Fairness Doctrine]]" which allowed editorials, if opposing views were given equal time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan L. Brinson|title=The Red Scare, Politics, and the Federal Communications Commission, 1941-1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V02uMPJGX5MC&amp;pg=PA34|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television era: 1950–1980s ==
Television arrived in the American home in the 1950s, and immediately became the main campaign medium. Party loyalties had weakened and there was a rapid growth in the number of independents. As a result candidates Paid less attention to rallying diehard supporters and instead appealed to independent-minded voters. They adopted television advertising techniques as their primary campaign device. At first the parties paid for long-winded half-hour or hour long speeches. By the 1960s, they discovered that the 30-second or one-minute commercial, repeated over and over again, was the most effective technique. It was expensive, however, so fund-raising became more and more important in winning campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. West, ''Air Wars: Television Advertising and Social Media in Election Campaigns, 1952-2012'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Major technological innovations transformed the mass media. Radio, already overwhelmed by television, transformed itself into a niche service. It developed an important political dimension based on [[Talk radio]]. Television survived with a much reduced audience, but remained the number one advertising medium for election campaigns. Newspapers were in desperate trouble; most afternoon papers closed, and most morning papers barely survived, as the Internet undermined both their advertising and their news reporting.

The new social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, made use first of the personal computer and the Internet, and after 2010 of the smart phones to connect hundreds of millions of people, especially those under age 35. By 2008, politicians and interest groups were experimenting with systematic use of social media to spread their message among much larger audiences than they had previously reached.&lt;ref&gt;Juliet E. Carlisle, and Robert C. Patton, "Is Social Media Changing How We Understand Political Engagement? An Analysis of Facebook and the 2008 Presidential Election," ''Political Research Quarterly'' (2013) 66#4 pp 883-895.

As political strategists turn their attention to the 2016 presidential contest, they identify Facebook as an increasingly important advertising tool. Recent technical innovations have made possible more advanced divisions and subdivisions of the electorate. Most important, Facebook can now deliver video ads to small, highly targeted subsets. Television, by contrast, shows the same commercials to all viewers, and so cannot be precisely tailored.&lt;ref&gt;Shane Goldmacher, "Facebook the Vote: The social network at the center of American digital life could become the epicenter of the presidential race," [http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/facebook-the-vote-20150612 ''National Journal Magazine'' June 13, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Online presence is vital to the success of a presidential candidate's campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://globalriskinsights.com/2016/03/how-social-media-is-changing-political-campaigns/|title=How social media is changing political campaigns {{!}} GRI|date=2016-03-11|newspaper=Global Risk Insights|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media presence lets candidates: have direct access to voters, advertise for free, and fundraise, among other benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uspolitics.about.com/od/CampaignsElections/tp/How-Social-Media-Has-Changed-Politics.htm|title=Social Media in Politics - Twitter and Facebook as Campaigns Tools|newspaper=About.com News &amp; Issues|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Microbiome in the ''Drosophila'' gut}}
The [[microbiota]] describes the sum of all symbiotic [[microorganisms]] ([[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], [[commensalism]] or [[pathogenic]]) living on or in an organism. The fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' is a [[model organism]] and known as one of the most investigated organisms worldwide. The microbiota in flies is less complex than that found in humans. It still has an influence on the fitness of the fly, and it affects different life-history characteristics such as lifespan ([[life expectancy]]), resistance against pathogens ([[immunity (medical)|immunity]]) and metabolic processes ([[digestion]]). Considering the comprehensive toolkit available for research in ''Drosophila'', analysis of its microbiome could enhance our understanding of similar processes in other types of host-microbiota interactions, including those involving humans.

== Microbial composition ==

''Drosophila melanogaster'' possesses a comparatively simple gut microbiota, consisting of only few bacterial species, mainly from two bacterial taxonomic groups: [[Firmicutes]] and [[Proteobacteria]].&lt;ref name="Erkosar 2013" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erkosar | first1 = B. | last2 = Storelli | first2 = G. | last3 = Defaye | first3 = A. | last4 = Leulier | first4 = F. | year = 2013 | title = Host-intestinal microbiota mutualism: "learning on the ﬂy" | url = | journal = Cell Host Microbe | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 8–14 | doi = 10.1016/j.chom.2012.12.004 | pmid=23332152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Staubach 2013" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Staubach | first1 = F. | last2 = Baines | first2 = J.F. | last3 = Kunzel | first3 = S. | last4 = Bik | first4 = E.M. | last5 = Petrov | first5 = D.A. | year = 2013 | title = Host species and environmental effects on bacterial communities associated with Drosophila in the laboratory and in the natural environment | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = | page = e70749 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0070749 | pmid=23967097 | pmc=3742674}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common species belong to the families [[Lactobacillaceae]] (abundance of approx. 30%, members of the Firmicutes) and [[Acetobacteraceae]] (approx. 55%, members of the Proteobacteria). Other less common bacterial species are from the families Leuconostocaceae, Enterococceae, and Enterobacteriaceae (all with an abundance in between 2–4%).&lt;ref name="Staubach 2013" /&gt; The most common species include ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus brevis]]'', ''[[Acetobacter pomorum]]'' and ''[[Enterococcus faecalis]]'', while other species such as ''[[Acetobacter aceti]]'', ''Acetobacter tropicalis'' and ''Acetobacter pasteurianus'' are also often found.&lt;ref name="Erkosar 2013" /&gt;

The particular species of the host fly has a central influence on the composition and quality of the gut microbiota, even if flies are raised under similar conditions.&lt;ref name="Boderick 2012" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Broderick | first1 = N.A. | last2 = Lemaitre | first2 = B. | year = 2012 | title = Gut-associated microbes of Drosophila melanogaster | url = | journal = Gut Microbes | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 307–321 | doi=10.4161/gmic.19896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the host’s diet and nutritional environment also shape the exact composition of the microbiota. For instance the exact [[pH]] of the food can kill certain bacterial species.&lt;ref name="Erkosar 2013" /&gt; In general, the type of food used by the fly affects the microbiota composition.&lt;ref name="Chandler 2011" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chandler | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Lang | first2 = J.M. | last3 = Bhatnagar | first3 = S. | last4 = Eisen | first4 = J.A. | last5 = Kopp | first5 = A. | year = 2011 | title = Bacterial communities of diverse Drosophila species: ecological context of a host-microbe model system | url = | journal = PLoS Genet | volume = 7 | issue = | page = e1002272 | doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mushroom feeder species like ''Drosophila fallen'' and MicroDrosophila sp. harbour many Lactobacillales and generally maintain high bacterial diversity in their guts. The microbiota of flower feeders such as ''Drosophila elegans'' and ''Drosophila ﬂavohirta'' shows higher abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and to a lesser extent of acido-philic bacteria (such as Acetobacteraceae and Lactobacillaceae) if compared to fruit-eating species such as ''Drosophila hydei'', ''Drosophila immigrans'', ''Drosophila sulfurigaster'', ''Drosophila melanogaster'', ''Drosophila sechellia'' or ''Drosophila takahashii''.&lt;ref name="Erkosar 2013" /&gt; The microbial load and bacterial composition also vary with the age of the host fly.&lt;ref name="Erkosar 2013" /&gt;

== Microbiota transmission and establishment ==

Feeding is a key determinant of the microbiota composition. Not only the diet influences presence and abundance of the bacteria inside the gut, but the bacteria also need to be taken up continuously from the environment to prevail as members of the intestinal flora. Feeding on feces seems to play a central role for establishment of the ''Drosophila'' microbiota, as it allows the flies to recycle the bacteria within a fly population at a particular time point and also across generations. Flies seed the embryonic eggshell with feces. Upon hatching, young larvae eat their eggshells and thereby pick up the bacteria. The microbiota, which subsequently establishes itself inside the gut of the developing larvae, is similar to that of the larvae's mothers.&lt;ref name="Blum 2013" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blum | first1 = J.E. | last2 = Fischer | first2 = C.N. | last3 = Miles | first3 = J. | last4 = Handelsman | first4 = J. | year = 2013 | title = Frequent replenishment sustains the beneficial microbiome of ''Drosophila melanogaster'' | doi = 10.1128/mbio.00860-13 | journal = mBio | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = e00860–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This may further be promoted by the particular life history of the flies. Young adult flies, which harbor fewer bacteria than old flies, proliferate in an environment shaped by the feces of the preceding fly generation, thus allowing them to take up additional bacteria.&lt;ref name="Blum 2013" /&gt;

== Gut compartmentalization ==

In the [[gut (anatomy)|gut]] of ''Drosophila melanogaster'' the composition and action of the microbiome appears to be tightly regulated within compartments, that is different sections of the intestines. This is indicated by the differential expression of genes, especially with a regulatory function, in the [[epithelium]] of different parts of the gut. In detail, the gut is compartmentalized into three parts, the '''foregut''', the '''midgut''', and the '''hindgut'''. While foregut and hindgut are lined with a cuticle formed by the [[ectodermal]] epithelium, the midgut is of [[entodermal]] origin.&lt;ref name="Lemaitre 2013" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lemaitre | first1 = B. | last2 = Miguel-Aliaga | first2 = I. | year = 2013 | title = The digestive tract of Drosophila melanogaster | url = | journal = Annu. Rev. Genet. | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 377–404 | doi=10.1146/annurev-genet-111212-133343}}&lt;/ref&gt; In adult flies the midgut is further divided into five smaller regions.&lt;ref name="Buchon 2013" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buchon | first1 = N. | last2 = Osman | first2 = D. | last3 = David | first3 = F.P. | last4 = Fang | first4 = H.Y. | last5 = Boquete | first5 = J.P. | last6 = Deplancke | first6 = B. | last7 = Lemaitre | first7 = B. | year = 2013 | title = Morphological and molecular characterization of adult midgut compartmentalization in Drosophila | url = | journal = Cell Rep. | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 1725–1738 | doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2013.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The immune response varies among the gut regions. The [[Immunodeficiency|immune deficiency]] (IMD) pathway responds to bacterial infections and is activated by certain receptors (e.g., the peptidoglycan receptor protein [[PGRP-LC]]). These receptors and also other components of the ''Drosophila'' immune system such as Toll receptor and [[dDUOX]] pathway molecules control immune responses in ectodermal tissue of the anterior gut. Moreover, the anterior midgut is enriched in certain antimicrobial peptides ([[AMPs]]). This suggests that the immune defence in this area is particularly responsive, possibly because this regions represents the first contact region for newly taken up food, microbiota, and/or intestinal pathogens. In the middle and posterior midgut, other genes such as the receptor [[PGRP-LB]], which down-regulates the IMD immune response, are expressed, possibly in order to minimize expression of immune defence against the microbiota. In addition, the microbiota itself seems to control the expression of several ''Drosophila'' metabolic genes within the midgut, possibly to facilitate digestion of food.&lt;ref name="Broderick 2014" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Broderick | first1 = N.A. | last2 = Buchon | first2 = N. | last3 = Lemaitre | first3 = B. | year = 2014 | title = Microbiota-induced changes in Drosophila melanogaster host gene expression and gut morphology | doi = 10.1128/mbio.01117-14 | journal = mBio | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = e01117–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taken together, it appears that the interaction between host and microbiota is precisely regulated across different regions within the gut.&lt;ref name="Bosco-Drayon 2012" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bosco-Drayon | first1 = V. | last2 = Poidevin | first2 = M. | last3 = Boneca | first3 = I.G. | last4 = Narbonne-Reveau | first4 = K. | last5 = Royet | first5 = J. | last6 = Charroux | first6 = B. | year = 2012 | title = Peptidoglycan sensing by the receptor PGRP-LE in the Drosophila gut induces immune responses to infectious bacteria and tolerance to microbiota | url = | journal = Cell Host Microbe | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 153–165 | doi=10.1016/j.chom.2012.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects on longevity ==

The microbiota seem to affect the lifespan of ''Drosophila melanogaster''. To date, the mechanisms of this effect remain elusive.&lt;br /&gt;
Fruit flies raised under [[axenic]] conditions (i.e., without any bacteria in the environment) or cured of their microbiota with [[antibiotics]] had a shorter lifespan than flies raised under normal conditions. The microbiota influence on longevity seems to be particularly strong early in development.&lt;ref name="Brummerl 2004" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brummel | first1 = T. | last2 = Ching | first2 = A. | last3 = Seroude | first3 = L. | last4 = Simon | first4 = A.F. | last5 = Benzer | first5 = S. | year = 2004 | title = Drosophila lifespan enhancement by exogenous bacteria | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | volume = 101 | issue = | pages = 12974–12979 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0405207101 | pmid=15322271 | pmc=516503}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To date, however, the exact mechanisms underlying these effects remain elusive. It is possible that the microbiota-induced proliferarion of intestinal [[stem cells]] and associated metabolic [[homeostasis]] is important in this context.&lt;ref name="Shin 2011" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shin | first1 = S.C. | last2 = Kim | first2 = S.H. | last3 = You | first3 = H. | last4 = Kim | first4 = B. | last5 = Kim | first5 = A.C. | last6 = Lee | first6 = K.A. | last7 = Yoon | first7 = J.H. | last8 = Ryu | first8 = J.H. | last9 = Lee | first9 = W.J. | year = 2011 | title = Drosophila microbiome modulates host developmental and metabolic homeostasis via insulin signaling | url = | journal = Science | volume = 334 | issue = | pages = 670–674 | doi=10.1126/science.1212782 | pmid=22053049}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the microbiota seems to have a negative effect on lifespan in old ''Drosophila melanogaster'', because their removal in ageing flies increases longevity. Old flies have a reduced ability to fight infections and this may also relate to the bacterial members of the microbiota.&lt;ref name="Ramsden 2008" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ramsden | first1 = S. | last2 = Cheung | first2 = Y.Y. | last3 = Seroude | first3 = L. | year = 2008 | title = Functional analysis of the Drosophila immune response during aging | url = | journal = Aging Cell | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 225–236 | doi=10.1111/j.1474-9726.2008.00370.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In aged animals, immune responses may over-shoot, possibly harming the host and favoruing colonization with pathogens (e.g. ''Gluconobacter morbifer'').&lt;ref name="Ryu 2008" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ryu | first1 = J.H. | last2 = Kim | first2 = S.H. | last3 = Lee | first3 = H.Y. | last4 = Bai | first4 = J.Y. | last5 = Nam | first5 = Y.D. | last6 = Bae | first6 = J.W. | last7 = Lee | first7 = D.G. | last8 = Shin | first8 = S.C. | last9 = Ha | first9 = E.M. | last10 = Lee | first10 = W.J. | year = 2008 | title = Innate immune homeostasis by the homeobox gene caudal and commensal-gut mutualism in Drosophila | url = | journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = | pages = 777–782 | doi=10.1126/science.1149357 | pmid=18218863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New method of microbiome analysis ==

Almost all current approaches for the characterization of ''Drosophila'' microbiota rely on destructive approaches, that is flies are killed, their gut is extracted and from these the bacteria are isolated and/or analyzed. For an assessment of microbiota dynamics across the lifespan of an individual fly or across development of a fly population, a non-destructive approach would be favorable. Such an approach was recently developed, focusing on the microbial characterization of fly feces. Fly feces are indeed informative on composition of the gut microbiota, since the diversity of gut bacteria, feces bacteria and bacteria of whole fly of ''Drosophila melanogaster'' are all strongly correlated. This new approach could be used to demonstrate the known influence of diets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fink | first1 = C | last2 = Staubach | first2 = F | last3 = Kuenzel | first3 = S | last4 = Baines | first4 = JF | last5 = Roeder | first5 = T | year = 2013 | title = Noninvasive Analysis of Microbiome Dynamics in the Fruit Fly Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 6984–6988 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.01903-13 | pmid=24014528 | pmc=3811555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Network Resource Planning''' is an enhanced process of network planning that incorporates the disciplines of business planning, marketing, and engineering to develop integrated, dynamic master plans for all domains of communications networks.

==Next generation services==

Many [[Communications Service Provider|communications service providers]] - from [[Wireline (networking)|wireline]], [[wireless]], [[broadband]] to [[Next Generation Networking|next generation]] carriers - are introducing next-generation services such as interactive video over cell phones and multi-user conference calling.&lt;ref name="cotrupe"&gt;{{cite web| first = Jeffrey| last = Cotrupe| title = OSS/BSS Shopping List for 2007. Part 1: Network Planning – An EMA Advisory Note| url = http://www.vpisystems.com/mediafiles/EMA_Cotrupe-0207_AN.pdf| publisher = Enterprise Management Associates| pages = 6| format = PDF| date = February 2007| accessdate = 2009-09-10| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081031005037/http://www.vpisystems.com/mediafiles/EMA_Cotrupe-0207_AN.pdf| archivedate = 2008-10-31| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These new services are straining the capacity of existing networks.  In a 2006 Reuters [https://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUSN1944376720061020 interview], John Roese, CTO of Nortel, pointed out that [[YouTube]] almost destroyed the Internet,&lt;ref name="dabrowski" &gt;{{cite news| first = Wojtek| last = Dabrowski| title = Video-hungry Users Could Push Net to the Brink: Nortel| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUSN1944376720061020| publisher =Reuters| accessdate = 2006-10-20 | date=2006-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a keynote [http://gigaom.com/2006/12/12/chambers-video-is-the-killer-app/ speech] at Cisco’s C-Scape analyst conference in December 2006, John Chambers, CEO of Cisco Networks said, “Things like YouTube are just the baby steps of the impact video will have on networks.”  Since every video transmission requires roughly 150 times the bandwidth of a voice transmission, it is estimated that a one percent adoption of the [[Verizon Wireless]] [[V CAST]] service required a 400 percent increase in Verizon’s corresponding network capacity. 

The bandwidth-intense nature of next generation services has required traditional [[Network planning and design|network planning]] to evolve.  Subscriber growth of legacy services like voice and data had an incremental impact on networks.  New subscriptions and their corresponding bandwidth demand followed a relatively linear growth curve.  As such, planning methods such as link- and node-specific [[Telecommunications forecasting|forecasting]] or “trending” were sufficient to ensure networks could support current and planned subscribers.

The dramatic swings in bandwidth demand that slight variances in subscription rates bring to bear on networks carrying services such as video can no longer be adequately planned for with these traditional methods.  Network Resource Planning addresses the weaknesses of trending by incorporating business planning and marketing insight in the planning process.  The addition of market analysis adds an additional layer of context and provides a feedback loop that enables more accurate planning. Furthermore, the importance of coordinating infrastructure investment activities across organizations is addressed to ensure that network capacity is provided when and where it is needed, and that human and [[Operations Support Systems|operational support system]] resources are appropriately included in the planning process.

==Next generation networks==

The bandwidth needs of next generation services has placed added pressure on carriers to migrate from traditional networks like [[PSTN]] and [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]] to new [[Internet Protocol|Internet Protocol (IP)]]-based, or [[Next Generation Networking|next generation networks]], that can more adequately support the new services.  Planning the transition to IP-based networks is a difficult endeavor in many respects. The [[Capital expenditure|capital expenditure (CAPEX)]] challenge of these new networks is that while it is remains expensive to make a mistake and deploy too much equipment (i.e., over-building their network and wasting assets), the non-linear relationship between bandwidth and network requirements means there are also significant costs from deploying too little (i.e., under-building the network and putting themselves at a higher chance of delivering poor [[quality of service]] and losing market share).

From a technical perspective, the new IP-based networks are also far more difficult to plan.  The self-routing nature of IP networks requires planners to determine how the network will behave under normal, overloaded, and failure scenarios. The fact that IP can drop or delay packets during overload conditions introduces new complexity to the system.  Interactive services such as voice, two-way video, and gaming are particularly susceptible to the resultant digital jitter and delay.  Under these circumstances, the network planners need to know how these services will be affected under varying conditions.  In addition, they need to know how the network can be configured to provide the best quality of service at the least cost.&lt;ref name="mortensen" &gt;{{cite web| first = Mark| last = Mortensen| title = Five Big Mistakes Carriers Make When Planning a Next-Generation Network| url = http://telephonyonline.com/broadband/news/next_generation_mistakes_032107/| publisher = Telephony Online| accessdate = 2007-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue is further compounded by the fact that the simplicity of IP network operations comes from a more uniform, layered approach to network architecture.  It’s the interaction between the layers of the network that creates significant complexity. For example, routine services can run on an IP (and/or Ethernet) network, while high-QoS services are assigned to special routes. These services ride on the underlying logical transport network (ring or mesh), which in turn rides on the underlying optical infrastructure.  For planning teams, the effect of traffic on each layer must be taken into account in the other layers.  This situation is made even more complex when reliability and disaster scenarios come into play, as backup resources must be made available at each layer in the hierarchy.&lt;ref name="mortensen" /&gt;

Traditionally, network planning was performed on a domain-by-domain (i.e., transport, access, etc.) and isolated basis.  Network Resource Planning has adapted to address the shared-fabric nature of IP networks by integrating planning across domains.  Network planners have a much more powerful tool in Network Resource Planning for leveraging all of the strengths of the various domains in comprehensive master plans.  Over the next five years, the vast majority of tier-1 and -2 service providers are expected to shift to convergent network planning systems to handle the complexity of these networks, as well as reduce CAPEX and operational costs.&lt;ref name="mcelligott" &gt;{{cite web| first = Tim| last = McElligott| title = VPIsystems delivers a plan for the future| url = http://telephonyonline.com/software/technology/vpisystems_oneplan_planning_112006/index.html| publisher = Telephony Online| accessdate = 2006-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7852">A '''Networked Control System''' ('''NCS''') is a [[control system]] wherein the control loops are closed through a communication [[computer network|network]]. The defining feature of an NCS is that control and feedback signals are exchanged among the system's components in the form of information packages through a network.

== Overview ==
The functionality of a typical NCS is established by the use of four basic elements: 
# [[Sensors]], to acquire information,
# [[Controller (control theory)|Controllers]], to provide decision and commands,
# [[Actuators]], to perform the control commands and
# [[Telecommunication network|Communication network]], to enable exchange of information.

The most important feature of a NCS is that it connects cyberspace to physical space enabling the execution of several tasks from long distance. In addition, networked control systems eliminate unnecessary wiring reducing the complexity and the overall cost in designing and implementing the control systems. They can also be easily modified or upgraded by adding sensors, actuators and controllers to them with relatively low cost and no major changes in their structure. Moreover, featuring efficient sharing of data between their controllers, NCS are able to easily fuse global information to make intelligent decisions over large physical spaces. 
                                                                                     
Their potential applications are numerous and cover a wide range of industries such as: space and terrestrial exploration, access in hazardous environments, factory automation, remote diagnostics and troubleshooting, experimental facilities, domestic robots, aircraft, automobiles, manufacturing plant monitoring, nursing homes and tele-operations. While the potential applications of NCS are numerous, the proven applications are few, and the real opportunity in the area of NCS is in developing real-world applications that realize the area's potential.

===Types of communication networks===
* [[Fieldbus]]es, e.g. CAN, LON etc.
* IP/[[Ethernet]]
* Wireless networks, e.g. [[Bluetooth]] or [[ZigBee|ZigBee or Zwave]]. The term [[Wireless Networked Control System]] (WNCS) is often used in this connection.

===Problems and solutions===
[[File:ISpace.jpg|320px|thumb|right|iSpace concept]]
Advent and development of the Internet combined with the advantages provided by NCS attracted the interest of researchers around the globe. Along with the advantages, several challenges also emerged giving rise to many important research topics. New control strategies, kinematics of the actuators in the systems, reliability and security of communications, bandwidth allocation, development of data communication protocols, corresponding [[Fault detection and isolation|fault detection]] and [[fault tolerant]] control strategies, real-time information collection and efficient processing of sensors data are some of the relative topics studied in depth.

The insertion of the communication network in the feedback [[control loop]] makes the analysis and design of an NCS complex, since it imposes additional time delays in control loops or possibility of packages loss. Depending on the application, time-delays could impose severe degradation on the system performance.

To alleviate the time-delay effect, Y. Tipsuwan and M-Y. Chow, in ADAC Lab at North Carolina State University, proposed the [[Gain Scheduler Middleware]] (GSM) methodology and applied it in iSpace. S. Munir and W.J. Book (Georgia Institute of Technology) used a [[Smith predictor]], a [[Kalman filter]] and an energy regulator to perform teleoperation through the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adac.ncsu.edu/ ADAC Lab]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adac.ncsu.edu/iSpace1/home.html iSpace]&lt;/ref&gt;

K.C. Lee, S. Lee and H.H. Lee used a genetic algorithm to design a controller used in a NCS. Many other researchers provided solutions using concepts from several control areas such as robust control, optimal [[stochastic control]], model predictive control, fuzzy logic etc.

Moreover, a most critical and important issue surrounding the design of distributed NCSs with the successively increasing complexity is to meet the requirements on system reliability and dependability, while guaranteeing a high system performance over a wide operating range. This makes network based fault detection and diagnosis techniques, which are essential to monitor the system performance,  receive more and more attention.

The "'''New Perspective on Paul'''" represents a significant shift since the 1960s in the way some scholars, especially [[Protestant]] scholars, interpret the writings of the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]].

Paul, especially in his [[Epistle to the Romans]], advocates justification through faith in [[Jesus Christ]] over justification through works of the Law. In the historic [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] perspective, known as ''[[sola fide]]'', theologians understood Paul as arguing that Christians’ [[good works]] would not factor into their [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] &amp;ndash; only their [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] would count. But according to the “new perspective”, Paul was not addressing good works in general, but instead questioning only observances such as [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]], [[Kashrut|dietary laws]], and Sabbath laws, which were the ‘boundary markers’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The New Perspective on Paul|last = Dunn|first = James D. G.|publisher = Eerdmans Publishing Co.|year = 2005|isbn = 978-0-8028-4562-7|location = Grand Rapids|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; that set the Jews apart from the other nations. This grew from the work of [[E. P. Sanders]], ''Paul and Palestinian Judaism'', published in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Paul and Palestinian Judaism|last = Sanders|first = E. P.|publisher = Fortress Press|year = 1977 |isbn = 978-0-8006-1899-5|location = Minneapolis|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanders saw the Jews of Pauline times not as a “legalistic community”, nor as oriented to “salvation by works”. For Sanders, the Jews felt they were saved as they were God's chosen people. By being God's chosen people they were under his [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]]. The Jews kept [[Torah|the Law]] to remain under the covenant &amp;ndash; the Law was not a way of entering the covenant but of staying within the covenant.

==Development==
Since the [[Protestant Reformation]] (c. 1517), studies of [[Pauline epistles|Paul’s writings]] have been heavily influenced by [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] views that are said to ascribe the negative attributes that they associated with [[Christianity in the 16th century|sixteenth-century Roman Catholicism]] to [[Second Temple Judaism]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} These Lutheran and Reformed views on Paul's writings are called “the old perspective” by adherents of the “new perspective on Paul”. The “new perspective” is an attempt to lift Paul's letters out of the Lutheran-Reformed framework and interpret them based on what is said to be an understanding of first-century Judaism, taken on its own terms.

In 1963 the Lutheran theologian [[Krister Stendahl]] published a paper arguing that the typical Lutheran view of the Apostle Paul’s theology did not fit with statements in [[Pauline Epistles|Paul’s writings]], and in fact was based more on mistaken [[Pauline Christianity|assumptions about Paul’s beliefs]] than careful interpretation of his writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0017816000024779 |jstor = 1508631 |title = The Apostle Paul and the Introspective Conscience of the West |year=1963 |last =Stendahl |first =Krister |journal= [[Harvard Theological Review]] |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=199–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stendahl warned against imposing modern Western ideas on the Bible, and especially on the works of Paul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url= |title= The Apostle Paul and the Introspective Conscience of the West |last= Stendahl |first= Krister |date= 1963 |journal= [[Harvard Theological Review]] |volume=56 |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 [[E. P. Sanders]] published ''Paul and Palestinian Judaism''.&lt;ref name="P. Sanders, 1977"&gt;{{Citation |first= EP |last= Sanders | author-link= E. P. Sanders |title= Paul and Palestinian Judaism: A Comparison of Patterns of Religion |publisher= Fortress Press |place= Philadelphia |year= 1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work he studies Jewish literature and Paul’s writings arguing that the traditional Lutheran understanding of the theology of Judaism and Paul was fundamentally incorrect.

Sanders continued to publish books and articles in this field, and was soon joined by the scholar [[James D. G. Dunn]]. Dunn reports that Anglican theologian [[N.T. Wright]] was the first to use the term “new perspective on Paul” in his 1978 Tyndale Lecture.&lt;ref&gt;[[N.T. Wright]], {{Google books|id=6i2xvonpvMwC&amp;redir_esc=y|page=11-2|title=Justification: God's Plan and Paul's Vision}}. SPCK, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-281-06090-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term became more widely known after being used by Dunn as the title of his 1982 Manson Memorial Lecture where he summarized and affirmed the movement,&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard N. Longenecker]], {{Google books|id=5Qs54KfN5dIC|page=327|title=Introducing Romans: Critical Issues in Paul's Most Famous Letter}}. Eerdmans, 2011. {{ISBN|978-0802866196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first = James D. G. |last =Dunn |authorlink= James Dunn (theologian) |year = 1983 | title = The New Perspective on Paul |journal= Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester |volume=65 | issue =2 |pages=95–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of these writers inspired a large number of scholars to study, discuss, and debate the relevant issues. Many books and articles dealing with the issues raised have since been published. [[N. T. Wright]] has written a large number of works aimed at popularising the “new perspective” outside of academia.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{Citation | first = NT | last = Wright | author-link = N. T. Wright | title = What Saint Paul Really Said | publisher = Eerdmans | year = 1997}}{{Page needed|date= December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The “new-perspective” movement is closely connected with a surge of recent scholarly interest in studying the Bible in the context of other ancient texts, and the use of social-scientific methods to understand ancient culture. Scholars affiliated with [[The Context Group]]{{refn|group=note|see: [[Philip Esler|Esler, Philip F.]] ''Conflict and Identity in Romans: The Social Setting of Paul's Letter''. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2003. - [[Bruce J. Malina|Malina, Bruce J.]] &amp; Neyrey, Jerome H., ''Portraits of Paul: An Archaeology of Ancient Personality'', Louisville: John Knox Press, 1996. - Neyrey, Jerome H., ''Paul, in Other Words: A Cultural Reading of His Letters''. Louisville: John Knox Press, 1990.}} have called for various reinterpretations of biblical texts based on studies of the ancient world.

== Main ideas ==
It is often noted that the singular title "the new perspective" gives an unjustified impression of unity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} It is a field of study in which many scholars{{who|date=September 2018}} are actively pursuing research and continuously revising their own theories in light of new evidence, and who do not necessarily agree with each other on any given issue. It has been suggested by many that a plural title of "new" perspective''s'' may therefore be more accurate.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In 2003, N. T. Wright, distancing himself from both Sanders and Dunn, commented that "there are probably almost as many 'new' perspective positions as there are writers espousing it – and I disagree with most of them".&lt;ref name = "NTW NP"&gt;N. T. Wright, ''[http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_New_Perspectives.htm New Perspectives].&lt;/ref&gt; There are certain trends and commonalities within the movement, but what is held in common is the belief that the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives of [[Paul the Apostle and Judaism]] are fundamentally incorrect. The following are some of the issues being widely discussed.

=== Works of the Law ===
Paul's letters contain a substantial amount of criticism of "[[Law and Gospel|works of the law]]". The radical difference in these two interpretations of what Paul meant by "works of the law" is the most consistent distinguishing feature between the two perspectives. The historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives interpret this phrase as referring to human effort to do good works in order to meet God's standards ([[Legalism (theology)|Works Righteousness]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In this view, Paul is arguing against the idea that humans can merit salvation from God by their good works alone (note that the "new" perspective agrees that we cannot merit salvation; the issue is what exactly Paul is addressing).

By contrast, new-perspective scholars see Paul as talking about "badges of covenant membership" or criticizing Gentile believers who had begun to rely on the Torah to reckon Jewish kinship.&lt;ref&gt;For "badges of covenant membership", see N. T. Wright, ''Paul for Everyone: Romans part one'' (Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 2004), 35–41. 5. For reliance on the Torah to reckon Jewish kinship, see {{cite journal |last=Eisenbaum |first=Pamela |date=Winter 2004 |title=A Remedy for Having Been Born of Woman: Jesus, Gentiles, and Genealogy in Romans

The new-perspective view is that Paul's writings discuss the comparative merits of following [[Torah|ancient Israelite]] or [[Athenian Golden Age|ancient Greek customs]]. Paul is interpreted as being critical of a common Jewish view that following traditional Israelite customs makes a person better off before God, pointing out that Abraham was righteous before the Torah was given. Paul identifies customs he is concerned about as [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]], [[Taboo food#Blood|dietary laws]], and [[Sabbath in Christianity|observance of special days]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, James D. 'The New Perspective on Paul', 104, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human effort and good works ===
Due to their interpretation of the phrase "works of the law", theologians of the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives see Paul's rhetoric as being against human effort to earn righteousness. This is often cited by Lutheran and Reformed theologians as a central feature of the Christian religion, and the concepts of [[sola gratia|grace alone]] and [[sola fide|faith alone]] are of great importance within the creeds of these denominations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

"New-perspective" interpretations of Paul tend to result in Paul having nothing negative to say about the idea of human effort or good works, and saying many positive things about both. New-perspective scholars point to the many statements in Paul's writings that specify the criteria of [[Last judgment|final judgment]] as being the works of the individual.

{{Quote | Final Judgment According to Works... was quite clear for Paul (as indeed for Jesus). Paul, in company with mainstream second-Temple Judaism, affirms that God’s final judgment will be in accordance with the entirety of a life led – in accordance, in other words, with works. | N. T. Wright&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_New_Perspectives.htm | title = New Perspectives on Paul | publisher = 10th Edinburgh Dogmatics Conference |date=August 2003 | first = N. T | last = Wright}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wright however does not hold the view that good works contribute to one's salvation but rather that the final judgment is something we can look forward to as a future vindication of God's present declaration of our righteousness. In other words, our works are a result of our salvation and the future judgment will show that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_New_Perspectives.pdf | title = New perspective | last = Wright | first = NT | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Others tend to place a higher value on the importance of good works than the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives do, taking the view that they causally contribute to the salvation of the individual.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Advocates of the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives often see this as being "salvation by works", and as a bad thing, contradicting fundamental tenets of Christianity. New-perspective scholars often respond that their views are not so different. For in the perspective of Luther and Calvin, God graciously empowers the individual to the faith which leads to salvation and also to good works, while in the "new" perspective God graciously empowers individuals to the faith and good works, which lead to salvation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

=== Faith, or faithfulness ===
An ongoing debate related to the "new" perspective has been over Paul's use of the Greek word ''pistis'' (''πίστις'', meaning "trust", "belief", "faith", or "faithfulness"). Writers with a more historic Lutheran and Reformed perspective have typically interpreted this word as meaning a [[Faith in Christianity|belief in God and Christ]], and trust in Christ for salvation with faith that he will save you.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} This interpretation is based on several passages from the Christian Bible, notably the [[Deutero-Pauline]] epistle to the Ephesians: "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast" (Eph. 2:9). [[E. P. Sanders]] has conceded that Ephesians 2:9 teaches the traditional perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Prentiss Waters, Justification and the New Perspectives on Paul, p. 167, notes "Sanders has conceded to me that Ephesians 2:9 teaches the traditional view."&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, many recent studies of the Greek word ''pistis'' have concluded that its primary and most common meaning was ''faithfulness'', meaning firm commitment in an interpersonal relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas A. Campbell, "The Quest For Paul’s Gospel: A Suggested Strategy", 2005, pp. 178–207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=3267114 |pages=461–476 |last1=Hay |first1=D. M. |title=Pistis as "Ground for Faith" in Hellenized Judaism and Paul |volume=108 |issue=3 |journal=Journal of Biblical Literature |year=1989 |doi=10.2307/3267114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=212–5 |doi=10.1177/001452467408500710 |title=The 'Faith of Christ' |year=1974 |last1=Howard |first1=G. |journal=The Expository Times |volume=85 |issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pilch and Malina, "Handbook of Biblical Social Values", 1998, pg 72–75&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the word could be almost synonymous with "obedience" when the people in the relationship held different status levels (e.g. a slave being faithful to his master). Far from being equivalent to "lack of human effort", the word seems to imply and require human effort. The interpretation of Paul's writings that we need "faithfully" to obey God's commands is quite different from one which sees him saying that we need to have "faith" that he will do everything for us. This is also argued to explain why James was adamant that "faith without works is dead" and that "a man is justified by works, and not by faith alone" (Js. 2:24), while also saying that merely to believe places one on the same level as the demons (see [[Epistle of James#Content|James 2]]). The "new" perspective argues that James was concerned with those who were trying to reduce faith to an intellectual subscription without any intent to follow God or Jesus, and that Paul always intended "faith" to mean a full submission to God.

Another related issue is the ''pistis Christou'' ("faith of Christ") debate. Paul several times uses this phrase at key points in his writings and it is linguistically ambiguous as to whether it refers to our faith in Christ ("objective genitive"), or Christ's own faithfulness to God ("subjective genitive"), or even our faith/faithfulness to God like that which Christ had ("adjectival genitive"). There is wide disagreement within the academic community over which of these is the best rendering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Synthesis inline|date=December 2011}}See, e.g.: '''for subjective genitive''':

=== Grace, or favor ===
Writers with a more historic Lutheran and Reformed perspective have generally translated the Greek word ''charis'' as "grace" and understood it to refer to the idea that there is a lack of human effort in salvation because God is the controlling factor. However those who study ancient Greek culture have pointed out that "favor" is a better translation, as the word refers normally to "doing a favor". In ancient societies there was the expectation that such favors be repaid, and this semi-formal system of favors acted like loans.&lt;ref&gt;David A.deSilva, Honor, Patronage, Kinship and Purity: Unlocking New Testament Culture, 2000, pg 117&lt;/ref&gt; Gift giving corresponded with the expectation of reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;B. J. Oropeza, "The Expectation of Grace," ''Bulletin for Biblical Research'' 24.2 (2014) 207-226&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is argued that when Paul speaks of how God did us a "favor" by sending Jesus, he is saying that God took the initiative, but is not implying a lack of human effort in salvation, and is in fact implying that Christians have an obligation to repay the favor God has done for them. Some argue that this view then undermines the initial "favor"—of sending Jesus—by saying that, despite his life, death and resurrection, Christians still have, as before, to earn their way to heaven. However, others note this is the horns of a [[false dilemma]] (all grace versus all works). Many new-perspective proponents that see "charis" as "favor" do not teach that Christians ''earn'' their way to heaven outside of the death of Christ. Forgiveness of sins through the blood of Christ is still necessary to salvation. But, that forgiveness demands effort on the part of the individual (cf. Paul in Phil. 3:12–16).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Romans_Theology_Paul.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Atonement ===
{{See also|Atonement in Christianity}}
To writers of the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives the [[penal substitution]] atonement theory and the belief in the "finished work" of Christ have been central. New-perspective writers have regularly questioned whether this view is really of such central importance in Paul's writings. Generally new-perspective writers have argued that other theories of the atonement are more central to Paul's thinking, but there has been minimal agreement among them as to what Paul's real view of the atonement might be.

The following is a broad sample of different views advocated by various scholars:
* E. P. Sanders argued that Paul's central idea was that we mystically spiritually participate in the risen Christ and that all Paul's judicial language was subordinate to the participationary language.&lt;ref name="P. Sanders, 1977"/&gt;
* N. T. Wright has argued that Paul sees Israel as representative of humanity and taking onto itself the sinfulness of humanity through history. Jesus, in turn, as Messiah is representative of Israel and so focuses the sins of Israel on himself on the cross. Wright's view is thus a "historicized" form of Penal Substitution.&lt;ref&gt;N. T. Wright, "Jesus and the Victory of God"{{Page needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chris VanLandingham has argued that Paul sees Christ as having defeated the Devil and as teaching humans how God wants them to live and setting them an example.&lt;ref&gt;Chris VanLandingham, "Judgment and Justification in Early Judaism and the Apostle Paul", Hendrickson 2006{{Page needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* David Brondos has argued that Paul sees Jesus as just a part in a wider narrative in which the Church is working to transform lives of individuals and the world, and that Paul's participatory language should be understood in an ethical sense (humans living Christ-like lives) rather than mystically as Sanders thought.&lt;ref&gt;David Brondos, "Paul on the Cross: Reconstructing the Apostle's Story of Redemption", Fortress Press, 2006{{Page needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pilch and Malina take the view that Paul holds to the [[Satisfaction theory of atonement|Satisfaction theory of atonement]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce J. Malina and John J. Pilch, "Social-Science Commentary on the Letters of Paul" Augsburg Fortress 2006{{Page needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stephen Finlan holds that Paul uses numerous different metaphors to describe the atonement; “justified by his blood” (Rom 5:9) means that a cultic substance has a judicial effect. Paul also taught the transformation of believers into the image of God through Christ ([[Divinization (Christian)|Theosis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Finlan, Problems with Atonement: The Origins of, and Controversy about, the Atonement Doctrine, Liturgical Press 2005, pp. 58–59, 120–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The "new" perspective has been an extremely controversial subject and has drawn strong arguments and recriminations from both sides of the debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2007/august/13.22.html|title=What Did Paul Really Mean? - Christianity Today|author=Simon Gathercole|work=ChristianityToday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 [[Steve Chalke]], after being influenced by new-perspective writers, published a book targeted at a popular audience which made comments highly critical of the [[penal substitution]] theory of the atonement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Steve | last1 = Chalke | first2 = Alan | last2 = Mann | title = The Lost Message of Jesus | publisher = Zondervan | year = 2003}}.{{Page needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused an extensive and ongoing controversy among Evangelicals in Britain, with a strong backlash from laypeople and advocates of the [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, Pat. "Atonement row gets personal as Evangelical partnership splits", 'Church Times', 27 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Chalke's views drew much support as well as criticism, with numerous articles, blogs and books being written on both sides of the debate.

The continuing controversy led to the [[Evangelical Alliance]] organising a symposium in July 2005 to discuss the issue. A record of this symposium includes a chapter by Chalke and his views are also contained in "the atonement debate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Derek Tidball, David Hilborn, | first = Justin Thacker | title = the atonement debate | page = 34 to 45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.eauk.org/media/joint-evangelical-alliance-london-school.cfm |title = Joint Evangelical Alliance&amp;nbsp;– London School Of Theology Atonement Symposium |accessdate = 2007-08-26 |date = 2005-07-08 |publisher = [[Evangelical Alliance]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Stephen |first = Jonathan |url = http://www.evangelical-times.org/archive/item/950/Biblical-theological/Chalkegate/ |title = Chalkegate |accessdate = 2011-11-25 |date = February 2005 |publisher = [[Evangelical Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of three [[Conservative Evangelicalism|conservative evangelical]] theologians responded to Chalke with their book, ''Pierced for our Transgressions'' (Crossway Publishing, 2007), which strongly criticised Chalke's position as inconsistent with some evangelical confessions of faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jeffery | first = Steve |author2=Mike Ovey |authorlink2=Mike Ovey |author3=Andrew Sach | isbn = 1-84474-178-8 | publisher = [[Inter-Varsity Press]] | title = Pierced for our Transgressions&amp;nbsp;– Rediscovering the Glory of Penal Substitution }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.piercedforourtransgressions.com | title = Pierced for our Transgressions&amp;nbsp;– Rediscovering the Glory of Penal Substitution | accessdate = 2007-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[N. T. Wright]] endorsed Chalke and spoke out against the latter book, commenting, for instance, that ‘despite the ringing endorsements of famous men, it [''Pierced For Our Transgressions''] is deeply, profoundly, and disturbingly unbiblical.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Wright |first = NT |authorlink = N.

Both sides of the debate have attempted to claim the higher, and more accurate, view of scripture. New-perspective advocates claim that supporters of the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspective are too committed to historic [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] tradition, and therefore fail to take a "natural" reading of the Bible; while those of the Lutheran and Reformed perspectives claim that new-perspective advocates are too intrigued by certain interpretations of context and history, which then lead to a biased hermeneutical approach to the text.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

The "new" perspective has been heavily criticized by conservative scholars in the Reformed tradition, arguing that it undermines the classical, individualistic, Augustinian interpretation of election and does not faithfully reflect the teachings of the Scriptures. It has been the subject of fierce debate among Evangelicals in recent years, mainly due to N. T. Wright's increasing popularity in [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] circles. Its most outspoken critics include Calvinists [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]],&lt;ref&gt;John Piper, [http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/interviews/interview-with-john-piper-about-the-future-of-justification-a-response-to-n-t-wright Interview with Piper on Wright], October 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sinclair Ferguson]],&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair Ferguson, [http://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/what-does-justification-have-do-gospel/ What Does Justification Have to do with the Gospel?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ligon Duncan and Sinclair Ferguson (video resource) [http://www.ligonier.org/learn/media/wright-teaching-another-gospel/ Is Wright Teaching Another Gospel?]&lt;/ref&gt; C.

In 2015 [[John M.G. Barclay]] published ''Paul and the Gift'' which re-frames Paul's theology of grace and, in doing so, provides a nuanced critique of the New Perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eerdmans.com/Products/6889/paul-and-the-gift.aspx|title=Paul and the Gift - John M.

== Catholic and Orthodox reactions ==
The "new" perspective has, by and large, been an internal debate among Protestant scholars. [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] writers have generally responded favorably to new-perspective ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Despotis, A., Die „New Perspective on Paul“ und die griechisch-orthodoxe Paulusinterpretation, [VIOTh 11], St. Ottilien: EOS-Verlag 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-8306-7705-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeing both a greater commonality with their own beliefs and strong similarities with the views of many of the early [[Church Fathers]]. From a Catholic point of view, the "new" perspective is seen as a step toward the progressive reality of human salvation in Christ. Moreover, passages in the works of many early Church Fathers show that new-perspective-style interpretations were widely held among them.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, "Against Heresy" 4:13–16. Ambrosiaster, "Commentary on Romans". Pelagius, "Commentary on Romans". Origen "Commentary on Romans". Justin Martyr, "Dialogue" Ch 10–11. Clement of Alexandria, "Stromata" 6:6. Ignatius, "Magnesians" 8. Cyril of Jerusalem, "Catechetical Lectures" 4:33.{{Synthesis inline|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the many exceptions is the influential [[Augustine of Hippo]]. While most in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox schools would see him as espousing a view of grace and justification in keeping with this "new" perspective, Augustine is blamed by some for introducing incorrect ideas{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. Some Orthodox have long criticized Augustine's soteriology, claiming it introduced novelties into Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Fr. John Romanides, The Ancestral Sin, Zephyr Publishing, Ridgewood, NJ, 1998, passim&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased importance new-perspective writers have given to good works in salvation has created strong common ground with the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. Historic [[Protestantism]] has never denied that there is a place for good and faithful works, but has always excluded them from [[Justification (theology)|justification]] and salvation, which Protestants argue is through [[faith alone]], and to which good deeds do not contribute, whether with or without God's grace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Augsburg Confession|url=http://bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php#article20|work=Book of Concord|accessdate=8 September 2012|location=Article 20|quote=[..]Furthermore, it is taught on our part that it is necessary to do good works, not that we should trust to merit grace by them, but because it is the will of God. It is only by faith that forgiveness of sins is apprehended, and that, for nothing. And because through faith the Holy Ghost is received, hearts are renewed and endowed with new affections, so as to be able to bring forth good works. For Ambrose says: Faith is the mother of a good will and right doing. For man's powers without the Holy Ghost are full of ungodly affections, and are too weak to do works which are good in God's sight. Besides, they are in the power of the devil who impels men to divers sins, to ungodly opinions, to open crimes. This we may see in the philosophers, who, although they endeavored to live an honest life could not succeed, but were defiled with many open crimes. Such is the feebleness of man when he is without faith and without the Holy Ghost, and governs himself only by human strength. Hence it may be readily seen that this doctrine is not to be charged with prohibiting good works, but rather the more to be commended, because it shows how we are enabled to do good works.[..]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calvin|first=John|title=Commentary on James|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom45.vi.iii.vi.html|work=Commentary on the Catholic Epistles|accessdate=8 September 2012|authorlink=John Calvin|location=James 2:18-19|quote=[..]This only he means, that faith, without the evidence of good works, is vainly pretended, because fruit ever comes from the living root of a good tree.[..]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has, since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], been a line of distinction between Protestantism (both [[Reformed]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canons of Dort|url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/dort.htm|accessdate=9 September 2012|location=FIRST HEAD: PARAGRAPH 3.|quote=Rejections of errors[..][of those W]ho teach: That the good pleasure and purpose of God, of which Scripture makes mention in the doctrine of election, does not consist in this, that God chose certain persons rather than others, but in this, that He chose out of all possible conditions (among which are also the works of the law), or out of the whole order of things, that act of faith which from its very nature is undeserving, as well as it incomplete obedience, as a condition of salvation, and that He would graciously consider this in itself as a complete obedience and count it worthy of the reward of eternal life.

A '''political faction''' is a group of individuals within a larger entity, such as a [[political party]], a [[trade union]] or other group, or simply a [[political climate]], united by a particular common political purpose that differs in some respect to the rest of the entity. A faction or political party may include fragmented sub-factions, "parties within a party," which may be referred to as power blocs, or voting blocs. Members of factions band together as a way of achieving these goals and advancing their agenda and position within an organisation.

Factions are not limited to political parties; they can and frequently do form within any group that has some sort of political aim or purpose.

The Latin word ''factio'' denoted originally either of the chariot teams that were organised professionally by private companies in ancient Rome, each recognisable by characteristic colour and arousing supporter hysteria similar to that in modern sports fans. These teams were not unlike gladiator schools, but the lethal nature of that entertainment meant few performers lasted long enough to build up similar crowd loyalty to the "team", while the fighters rarely actually teamed up, but rather fought duels or beasts. In time, political currents could become associated with such a team, although precisely how this happened is unclear. In Byzantine Constantinople, two such chariot factions, blue and green, repeatedly made or broke the claims of candidates to the imperial throne.

Occasionally, the term "faction" is still used more or less as a synonym for political party, but "with opprobrious sense, conveying the imputation of selfish or mischievous ends or turbulent or unscrupulous methods", according to the Oxford English Dictionary. In his Dictionary, Samuel Johnson (a [[Tory]]) dismissively defined [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] as "the name of a faction". Similarly, in the tenth instalment of The Federalist Papers, [[James Madison]] defines a faction as "a number of citizens, whether amounting to a minority or majority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community." In plain English this is a group that pursues self-interest at the expense of the greater good.

==Aims of factions==
The aims of a political faction are as diverse as the different types of bodies within which they appear. Typically, however, they include: advancing a particular [[policy]] or policy agenda, preventing the adoption of alternative policies and supporting given individuals to positions of power within the organisation or in the wider political world.  A faction can primarily be based around supporting a given person or group, or a single major aim, with little in the way of common agenda otherwise, or it can have a comprehensive and definitive set of policies.  Either way, factional politics typically revolve around personality, with a few individuals playing key roles, acting as a magnet for like-minded people, leading the activities of the faction, and acting as a prominent voice for the shared objectives of the faction. Such individuals can be referred to by a variety of names, such as “powerbrokers” or “factional chiefs”.

==Organisation==
&lt;!--Please DO NOT change the spelling of "organisation" to "organization". See [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#National varieties of English]].--&gt;
Factions differ in the amount of organisation and internal structure they possess. On the left, these may take the form of tendencies or [[platform (European politics)|platforms]]. Most factions are very loose organisations, having no definitive list of members, but some factions, have a formal internal structure, with membership lists, regular meetings, official positions – such as negotiators, conveners, [[whip (politics)|whips]] and organisers, – and a definitive policy position on every issue affecting the broader organisation. Such factions will typically be binding; that is, they rely upon all members casting their votes in accordance with the pre-ordained official stance of the faction.

==Operation of factions==
In political organisations that are [[democracy|democratic]] in structure, factions rely heavily on securing enough votes to win important ballots. This process is sometimes referred to as “doing the numbers”. Having the numbers will allow the faction to push policies it supports and elect its members to powerful positions within the broader organisation.

If one faction develops within an organisation, there will usually be at least one other that develops in opposition to it. Opposing factions will try to match each other's level of organisation and internal discipline, but will also engage in negotiations and trade-offs to ensure that the organisation’s activities are not compromised and that every group has a chance to obtain at least some of its goals.

Key to the operation of an organised faction is the existence of a power base. This will typically be some office, division or branch of the broader organisation over which the faction has effective control. Sometimes a power base may be an external or affiliated organisation that is involved with the broader organisation in some way.

A power base serves several key functions:
* It acts as a recruitment centre for new members, and promotes homogeneity within the membership (crucial for maintaining factional cohesion);
* It can be used as an organising centre for factional events and activities;
* It functions as a springboard, advancing the career of selected factional members and allowing them to gain skills that will increase their effectiveness and clout.

==Effects of factions==
The existence of a factional system can have serious negative consequences for a political organisation.  If factional strife becomes intensive and public, the organisation may suffer from perceptions of disunity. Taken one step further, if the conflict is particularly severe, it may cause ruptures within the organisation that seriously impede its effectiveness, leading to break-up or collapse of the organisation.

To avoid harm to the organisation, factional operations are usually conducted under strong secrecy and with minimal public scrutiny. This, however, can lead to the proliferation of unethical behaviour. Warfare between the factions may lead to tactics such as ballot box-stuffing, stack-outs, membership fraud, and other generally fraudulent conduct. Individuals who abandon a faction may be subject to intense personal [[Feud|vendettas]] where their former comrades go about sabotaging their careers.  A climate of intense factional conflict can also motivate individuals to focus on attacking their factional enemies rather than furthering the broader organisation.

Despite this, the benefits of factional systems are often overlooked. It is often incomprehensible to outsiders why members of a broader organisation would engage in factionalism. This stems from the assumption that the natural factional relationship is one of conflict and strife, when in fact, factions are often able to engage in productive co-operation.

In any political organisation there are likely to be many highly opinionated and passionate people. The existence of a factional system allows its operations to be more predictable and stable. Compromise and give-and-take between factions allows the organisation to operate without having to satisfy the whims of many different, uncompromising individuals who might otherwise cause a split. So, somewhat counter-intuitively, factionalism can actually promote organisational harmony.

Factions also help to broaden and diversify the organisation’s appeal. A person who might otherwise find the organisation’s goals unattractive might be persuaded to support a faction within it whose goals are closer to their own. Just as a democratic [[government]] is often invigorated by a strong [[Parliamentary Opposition|opposition]], so having a number of distinct points-of-view with an organisation can energise it and allow it to perform its role more effectively. It is also highly unlikely that any sizeable political organisation is wholly united in purpose, so arguably factions simply represent a way of managing pre-existing differences within the organisation.

The Founding Fathers of the American constitution, explicitly warned against the dangers of party factionalism. Madison, Hamilton, and Washington expressed the belief that factions would create divides that would ultimately dismantle the government. These sentiments can be found in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', specifically Federalist 10 and 51 written by Madison.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7619">The '''Principles for the Conservation of Heritage Sites in China''' ({{zh|c=中国文物古迹保护准则|p=Zhōngguó wénwù gǔjī bǎohù zhǔnzé}}) is a conservation charter promulgated in 2000 by China [[ICOMOS]] with the approval of [[State Administration of Cultural Heritage]] (SACH {{zh|c=国家文物局|p=Guójiā wénwù jú}}). It provides a methodological approach to the [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] of [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] sites in [[China]].

==Background==
While sustained debate on approaches to conservation dates from the nineteenth century, only in the mid-twentieth century were the first international and national conservation charters drawn up.&lt;ref name="Forward"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/pdf_publications/china_prin_2english.pdf |title=Principles for the Conservation of Heritage Sites in China - Foreword |pages=55–56 |author=Agnew, Neville |author2=Demas, Martha |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, the development of modern conservation concepts and practice began in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Principles"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/pdf_publications/china_prin_2english.pdf |title=Principles for the Conservation of Heritage Sites in China - Principles |pages=59–66 |author=Zhang Bai |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 the [[People's Republic of China]] began a national inventory and assessment of the significance of its cultural sites.&lt;ref name="Afterword"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/pdf_publications/china_prin_2english.pdf |title=Principles for the Conservation of Heritage Sites in China - Afterword |pages=91–93 |author=Zhang Bai |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2004, over 400,000 heritage sites had been identified nationwide, with over 1,230 listed as being of national importance.&lt;ref name="GCI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/field_projects/china/ |title=China Principles |publisher=Getty Conservation Institute |accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 the [[Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Cultural Relics]], consolidating previous legislation, entrusted primary responsibility for the conservation of cultural heritage to the government, while regulating the actions of conservation professionals. In 1985 China ratified the UNESCO [[World Heritage Convention]]. In May 1997 SACH requested that the [[Getty Conservation Institute]] assist in drawing up China's first conservation charter, with the [[Burra Charter]] proposed as a model. A tripartite project with the [[Australian Heritage Commission]] was launched in October 1997.&lt;ref name="Afterword"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GCI"/&gt;

By involving foreign parties as well as drawing upon domestic experience, it was intended that international best practice should guide local heritage practitioners.&lt;ref name="Afterword"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GCI"/&gt; The Preface to the China Principles states 'China's magnificent sites are the heritage not only of the various [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnic groups in China]] but are also the common [[World Heritage Site|wealth of all humanity]] … it is the responsibility of all to bequeath these sites to future generations in their full integrity and [[Authenticity in art|authenticity]].&lt;ref name="Principles"/&gt; [[Economic development]], [[Cultural tourism|mass tourism]], [[globalization]], and [[nationalism|national interests]] have all affected the country's historic legacy.&lt;ref name="Forward"/&gt; 

==Promulgation and publication==
The 38 articles of the China Principles, with accompanying commentary, were promulgated by China ICOMOS in late 2000 with the approval of SACH. The principles are grouped into five chapters: (1) General Principles; (2) The Conservation Process; (3) Conservation Principles; (4) Conservation Interventions; and (5) Additional Principles. An English-language translation was first published in July 2002 and a bilingual version with a Chinese-English and English-Chinese glossary was published in May 2004. It is recognised that, as use of the guidelines reveals the need for change, the Principles will be revised. A planned further document is to comprise illustrated examples of successful conservation measures.&lt;ref name="Forward"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Principles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Afterword"/&gt;

==The 38 Articles==
(1) Definition of heritage sites
(2) Conservation to include both intervention and preventive measures
(3) Heritage values
(4) Benefit of society not short-term gain
(5) Conservation to comply with laws, regulations and standards; significance is the highest priority throughout

(20) Maintenance programme
(21) Intervention must be reversible, 'unobtrusive' yet 'distinguishable', and disclosed to the public
(22) Conservation techniques and materials must be proven
(23) Aesthetic criteria, derived from historic authenticity
(24) Landscape and setting
(25) No reconstruction, except in special cases
(26) Excavation entails conservation
(27) Disaster plans
(28) Intervention should have clear objectives, use proven methods and materials, and be documented
(29) Regular maintenance
(30) Physical protection
(31) Minor restoration
(32) Any restoration should preserve traces of periods of significance
(33) No conjectural reconstruction
(34) Treatment of setting and landscaping should not adversely affect site
(35) Archaeological sites should typically be reburied to conserve and prevent theft
(36) Principles may also be applied to commemorative places
(37) Principles may also be drawn upon for cultural, historic, and submarine landscapes and historic cities
(38) Principles drafted and adopted by China ICOMOS and approved by SACH; amendments should follow similarly.&lt;ref name="Principles"/&gt;

==Commentary==
Extended commentary clarifies the way in which these principles should be interpreted and implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/pdf_publications/china_prin_2english.pdf |title=Principles for the Conservation of Heritage Sites in China - Commentary |pages=69–88 |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2377">The '''Protein Dispersibility Index''' (PDI) is a means of comparing the solubility of a [[protein]] in water, and is widely used in the [[soybean]] product industry.

A sample of the soybeans are ground, mixed with a specific quantity of water, and the two are then blended together at a specific rpm for a specific time. The resulting mixture and original bean flour then have their protein content measured using a combustion test, and the PDI is calculated as the percentage of the protein in the mix divided by the percentage in the flour - a PDI of 100 therefore indicates total solubility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilcrop.com/ipglab/soybtest/soybdesc.htm|title=Illinois Crop Improvement Association Soybean Tests|accessdate=2007-06-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070813201738/http://www.ilcrop.com/ipglab/soybtest/soybdesc.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livestocktrail.uiuc.edu/sand/definitions.cfm|title=University of Illinois Extension - Soy in Animal Nutrition Databases|accessdate=2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that the PDI can be affected, not only by the type of soybean used, but also by manufacturing processes - heat has been shown to lower the PDI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps.fass.org/cgi/content/abstract/79/11/1592|title=Protein dispersibility index as an indicator of adequately processed soybean meal|author1=AB Batal |author2=MW Douglas |author3=AE Engram |author4=CM Parsons  |last-author-amp=yes |accessdate=2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PDI required of a soyflour is dependent on the purpose to which the soybeans are to be put. Manufacturers of [[soymilk]] and [[tofu]] products want a high PDI to ensure the maximum protein content in their products. However, manufacturers of soy-based fish feed require a low PDI to avoid loss of valuable protein into the surrounding water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afs.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;doi=10.1577%2F1548-8640(1984)46%3C161%3APDIPAA%3E2.0.CO%3B2|title=Protein Dispersibility Index (PDI) As A Quality Control Measure For Soy Flour Used In Brown Trout Starter Feed|accessdate=2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proto-fascism''' refers to the direct predecessor ideologies and cultural movements that influenced and formed the basis of [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Spackman. Fascist virilities: rhetoric, ideology, and social fantasy in Italy. Pp. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Davies, Derek Lynch. ''The Routledge companion to fascism and the far right''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge. Pp. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent proto-fascist figure is [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]], the [[Italian nationalism|Italian nationalist]] whose politics influenced [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Italian Fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Spackman. Fascist virilities: rhetoric, ideology, and social fantasy in Italy. Pp. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Proto-fascist political movements include the [[Italian Nationalist Association]] (ANI), the [[German National Association of Commercial Employees]] (DHV) and the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Davies, Derek Lynch. ''The Routledge companion to fascism and the far right''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge. Pp. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Precedence to modern fascism can be seen in the culture and government of older nations based heavily on law and order, such as the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[ancien régime|anciens régimes]] of Europe.

Other people that have been labeled proto-fascist are [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Charles Maurras]] and [[Ion Dragoumis]] (by John Mazis in his book "A Man For All Seasons"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ethnikonkratos.gr/2017/06/05/%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%AC%CE%BD%CE%BD%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%BC%CE%AC%CE%B6%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%BF-%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%8D%CE%BC%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%BD-%CE%AD%CF%87%CF%89-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%BC/|title=Γιάννης Μάζης: «Ο Δραγούμης δεν έχω καμία αμφιβολία ότι ήταν ένας πρωτοφασίστας»|date=2017-06-04|work=Εθνικόν Κράτος|access-date=2018-10-23|language=el-GR}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Public Analysts''' are scientists in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] whose principal task is to ensure the safety and correct description of food by testing for compliance with legislation.&lt;ref name=Dublin&gt;[http://www.publicanalystdublin.ie/en/ Public Analyst's Laboratory, Dublin]&lt;/ref&gt; Most Public Analysts are also Agricultural Analysts who carry out similar work on animal feedingstuffs and fertilisers.&lt;ref name=AgAct&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1970/pdf/ukpga_19700040_en.pdf Agriculture Act 1970, CHAPTER 40]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nowadays this includes checking that the food labelling is accurate. They also test drinking water, and may carry out chemical and biological tests on other consumer products.&lt;ref name=UKPAS&gt;[http://www.publicanalyst.com/News/Adjournment_Debate/The_Public_Analyst_Service_April_2009.pdf The Public Analyst Service]&lt;/ref&gt; While much of the work is done by other scientists and technicians in the laboratory, the Public Analyst has legal responsibility for the accuracy of the work and the validity of any opinion expressed on the results reported. There is an [http://www.publicanalyst.com/ Association of Public Analysts], which includes members with similar roles if different titles in other countries.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;[http://www.publicanalyst.com/ Association of Public Analysts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The office of Public Analyst was established in 1860, with the Act for Preventing the Adulteration of Articles of Food and Drink, the first three appointments being in [[London]], [[Birmingham]] and [[Dublin]].&lt;ref name=Dublin/&gt;  Since the separation of the UK and Ireland, they operate under different legislation, but the term and general duties are the same.  The original work was chemical testing, and this is still a major part, but nowadays microbiological examination of food is an important activity, particularly in Scotland, where Public Analyst laboratories also carry out a statutory Food Examiner role.

==UK==
The primary UK legislation is the [[Food Safety Act 1990]].   All local authorities are required to appoint a Public Analyst,&lt;ref name=FSA1990S27&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1990/ukpga_19900016_en_5#pt3-pb1-l1g27]&lt;/ref&gt; although there have always been fewer Public Analysts and their laboratories than local authorities, most being shared by a number of local authorities. On the UK mainland there has always been a mixture of public sector and private sector laboratories. This remains the case today - but they all provide an equivalent service, and avoidance of conflicts of interest are ensured by the statutory terms of appointment. There is a statutory qualification requirement&lt;ref name=SI2463&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1990/Uksi_19902463_en_1.htm Statutory Instrument 1990 No. 2463 The Food Safety (Sampling and Qualifications) Regulations 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; for Public Analysts, known as the Mastership in Chemical Analysis (MChemA), awarded by the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]].  This is a specialist postgraduate qualification by examination that verifies knowledge and understanding of food and its potential defects, interpretation of food law, and the application and interpretation of chemical analysis for food law enforcement.

The Public Analysts’ laboratories must be third-party accredited to [[British Standard]] ISO 17025.&lt;ref name=ISO17025&gt;International Standard ISO/IEC 17025:2005 - ''General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories''  [[British Standards Institution|BSI]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 1980s there were some 40 Public Analyst Laboratories in the UK with over 100 appointed Public Analysts.  By 1993 that had reduced to 34 Laboratories and around 80 Public Analysts, and by 2010 the number of Public Analyst Laboratories in the UK had reduced to 22&lt;ref name=PALabs&gt;[http://www.publicanalyst.com/The_Laboratories/the_laboratories.html]&lt;/ref&gt; with only about 26 Public Analysts.

Enforcement of food law in the UK is by local authorities, principally their [[environmental health|environmental health officers]] and [[Trading Standards Institute|trading standards officers]].  Whilst these officers are empowered to take samples of food, the actual assessment in terms of chemical analysis or microbiological examination and subsequent interpretation that are necessary to determine whether a food complies with legislation is carried out by Public Analysts and Food Examiners respectively, scientists whose qualifications and experience are specified by regulations.

==Ireland==
Public Analyst Laboratories in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Dublin and [[Galway]] provide an analytical service to the Food Safety Authority.&lt;ref name=Dublin/&gt;

==Practice==
The Public Analyst runs a laboratory which will:
* Analyse food:
** for composition: many foods have legally defined, customary or expected  compositions
** for [[food additive|additives]]: which must be legally permitted and within prescribed concentrations
** for [[Food contaminants|contamination]]: chemical, [[Microbiology|microbiological]]
** to assess the accuracy of labelling
** to investigate whether complaints by the public are justified
* Interpret relevant law passed by the [[European Union|EU]] and UK or Ireland:
** act as [[expert witness]] in prosecutions

In addition to their central rôle in relation to food law enforcement, Public Analysts provide expert scientific support to local authorities and the private sector in various other areas, for example they:
* analyse [[drinking water|drinking]], bathing water including swimming pools, industrial effluents, industrial process waters and other waters
* investigate environmental products and processes including assessing land contamination, building materials and examining fuels 
* advise on [[waste management]]
* investigate and monitor [[air pollution]]
* advise on consumer safety - in particular consumer products such as toys
* monitor asbestos and other hazards
* carry out toxicological work to assist HM Coroners

== Sampling ==
Sampling is largely outside the control of the Public Analyst.

Local authorities have a duty to check the safety of food and to provide adequate protection of the consumer. To achieve that they devise sampling plans, seeking to balance their need to monitor food against limited resources and other demands on their budgets. A typical sampling plan for a local authority might include samples of the following:

* samples from a particular source - a supermarket, manufacturer or caterer or country
* meat products - to check %meat or %fat or non-meat  or additives or species
* product marketing claims
* undeclared ingredients in prepared foods
* contaminated products
* nutritional content of prepared meals

'''Reality mining''' is the collection and analysis of machine-sensed environmental data pertaining to human social [[behavior]], with the goal of identifying predictable patterns of behavior. In 2008, ''MIT Technology Review'' called it one of the "10 technologies most likely to change the way we live."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?ch=specialsections&amp;sc=emerging08&amp;id=20247 "TR10: Reality Mining", ''Technology Review Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Reality mining studies human interactions based on the usage of wireless devices such as [[mobile phones]] and GPS systems providing a more accurate picture of what people do, where they go, and with whom they communicate with rather than from more subjective sources such as a person's own account. Reality mining is one aspect of [[digital footprint]] analysis.&lt;ref name=businessweek-gold&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2008/tc20080323_387127.htm "There's Gold in 'Reality Mining{{'"}}, BusinessWeek 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Reality Mining'' is using [[Big data|Big Data]] to conduct research and analyze how people interact with technology everyday to build systems that allow for positive change from the individual to the global community. Reality Mining also deals with ''[[data exhaust]] .''

== Individual Scale (1 person) ==

Individuals use mobile phones, tablets, laptops, cameras, and any device connected to the internet for a variety of purposes, therefore creating a variety of data from GPS locations to frequently asked questions on Google. Mobile phones carry so much data about the individual that now phones can suggest restaurants based on our searches, visited places, book preference, and even guess the ends of sentences we type. A simple application of Reality Mining is listening to voices and understanding speech patterns to diagnose medical problems such as the simple flu to even early onset Parkinson's. More powerful phones also allow for calendar customization and event tracking which display behaviors within individuals, what is deemed important enough to track. Social websites also allow researchers to view snapshots of a person's life by following status updates on FaceBook or tweets from Twitter. Even more specific, a recent app called Snapchat allows users to post videos, pictures, or even live streams of exactly what they're doing when they're doing it, strong indicators of behaviors and interactions with the world. In 2004, MIT conducted the Reality Mining Project which gave 100 MIT students a Nokia 6600 which was tracked in a variety of ways by the researchers. The Cell Tower ID #'s (a very cheap and unobtrusive way to measure location), the status of the phone (charging or idle), and any use of the phone's applications (games, web surfing, etc...). They found that by collecting this kind of data, they could predict with high accuracy the behaviors of the students, for example, if one of the students woke up on a Saturday morning at 10 AM, the researches could predict what they were going to do that day using "eigenbehaviors". This new way of understanding data opened up doors for new research and possibly even larger survey research with detailed and accurate statistics. There are hundreds of websites offering software for mobile phones that will track just about everything the phone does, useful for worried parents or people who want to increase their personal productivity. This data is then uploaded to a server and can be accessed at any time.

Although already a lot of data can be collected from personal devices, they only make up a part of a person's life. Reality Miners can also use biometric devices to measure physical health and activity. There are many devices like this such as the Fitbit, Nike+, and Polar and Garmin GPS watches. There is even an app called Sleep Cycle for iPhone and Android users that measures sleep quality, which includes the amount of sleep and even optimal alarms settings. Using this data, Reality Miners may be able to measure one's actual health and processes that allow us to function (or dysfunction). Heart attacks generally don't have any longitudinal indicators, but using all this data or even when a person engages in Lifelogging can create date useful to the medical field and track the lifestyles of those who undergo heart attacks to then create preventative guidelines. There are several ways to start Lifelogging, for instance Google has its own device called Google Glass that has a Heads-Up-Display (HUD), a microphone, a processor, and a camera. These are all ways to log information in specific directories.

== Community Scale (10 to 1,000 people) ==

The way researchers have started to observe and record behaviors in large groups was by using [[Rfid tag|RFID badges]]. Data is also recorded in work places using Knowledge Management Systems that try to improve worker productivity and efficiency, although a short-coming of this is the inability to converge the social and technological cultures of the work place, therefore providing incomplete behavioral data. Another way to measure larger groups of people in a community is through conference attendance. This data allows researchers to know where participants are from, ethnic demographics, and the actual number of people attending the event. Some conferences use smart-badges with more functions than the standard RFID badges. Companies like Microsoft and IBM have used them to record the number of people they interact with during the conference and allow people to answer survey questions. The smart-badges also record vocal interactions and when attendees are at certain booths and can even alert booth workers when certain profiles enter within a certain range of the booth. Smart-badges have obvious advantages for gathering data for reality miners. In 2009, a company called nTag, which was then acquired by Alliance Technology used nTag technology which allows for users to even be notified who to talk to and it's able to exchange business cards electronically. 
Another type of data reality miners are looking are climate and environmental information. They collect data from neighborhoods by employing air-quality sensors which records [[carbon dioxide]] and nitrogen oxides as well as the general climate. Information like this could help policy makers decide whether to act or not or to see progress. Another way to collect data about the surrounding is through Project Noah. Project Noah was an effort to collect data on types of plant species by geotagging pictures of plants and fungi people upload, allowing users to see the kind of ecosystems users live in. This helps schools and students who want to collect data for projects, but also for bird-watchers to know what kind of birds are in the area.

== City Scale (1,000 to 1,000,000 people) ==

In general terms for this section, a city is defined  by 1,000 to 1,000,000 people. One way data is collected on a city scale is through collecting data on traffic with traffic signals and speed cameras. Data can also be collected from police reports and road scanners as well as GPS from mobile applications. Using this kind of traffic data, cities can create routes that would best allow for efficient movement and flow of traffic. A company called Inrix, started in 2010, has been compiling data on traffic and buys data from bridge operators and other transportation systems. It uses this data to predict traffic routes and time of congestion. Another way traffic can be monitored is through bluetooth technology, which is a technology that Inrix does not consider. The University of Maryland completed a project in 2012 that demonstrated that two Bluetooth sensors permanently placed two miles apart could accurately detect traffic speeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catt.umd.edu/sites/default/files/documents/UMD-BT-Brochure_REV3.pdf BLUETOOTH TRAFFIC MONITORING TECHNOLOGY - UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND – CENTER FOR ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eagle|first1=Nathan|last2=Green|first2=Kate|title=Reality Mining : Using Big Data to Engineer a Better World|journal=The MIT Press|date=August 2014|pages=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of this combined can be created to make route-suggestion algorithms to help people get to and from places in an efficient matter that, additionally, the route can update itself in real time using these type of sensors and information. Notable start-up, now a subsidiary of google, [[Waze]], which also collected data from users (anonymously) who reported accidents and this game them in-app currencies and rewards. 
For crime on the city scale, the first way to collect and view data is through historical research of previous reports within any area. Now, more complex algorithms automatically place officers in places of high crime rates before any actual crime has been committed. Since 2005, the Memphis Police Department has been using a program called Blue CRUSH (Criminal Reduction Utilization Statistical History) which uses the police reports and uses heat maps to distinguish between high and low areas of crime. This program updates itself weekly and allows to the police department to change tactics accordingly. Using this kind of data will allow police departments to interact with the society in a much more meaningful way, also allowing preventative work to be done rather than rehabilitative work.

== National Scale (1,000,000 to 100,000,000 people) ==

On the national scale, government play a much larger role. Census data are by far the easiest to acquire. Many nations make their census findings public via websites from which data can be downloaded and visualized for further analysis. "In addition, the World Bank conducts international surveys and compiles census data from all participating nations— a sort of one-stop shop for information on its member countries. These data are publicly accessible: they can be downloaded and independently sorted and analyzed. Importantly, the World Bank offers an open API that allows programmers to integrate various data into software applications. Using World Bank data, Google has integrated a simple visualization tool into its search results; a search query on the population of Botswana will pull up the number, the dated World Bank source, and a graph showing population change over decades".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eagle|first1=Nathan|last2=Green|first2=Kate|title=Reality Mining : Using Big Data to Engineer a Better World|journal=The MIT Press|date=August 2014|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way to collect data is through [[call data record]] (or call detail record) which is just a log of phone calls and texts with information such as time and location of both the caller or sender and the recipient. CDR's allow phone companies to view human mobility trends. Major data companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter also allow researchers to track cultural trends and even the when/where of the allocation of resources in time of natural disasters.

== Global Scale (100,000,000 to 7,000,000,000 people) ==

The biggest worry for the world is the spread of disease and is one of reality mining's best applications. With globalization, the ability to travel is unprecedented compared to previous histories. The United Nations has created an agenda called the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDG) which are eight goals that aim to improve the world. They collect population data, the first step to allowing for policy making on disease control, nations must first collect data on air travel as billions of people travel by air each year and sea travel. Air travel carries more people each year than sea shipments, but the primary reason for collecting data on shipments is that shipments often carry pests that carry diseases, food-borne illnesses, and sometimes invasive species of plant and animal. 
The idea of managing and collecting seems monumental, but the World Bank has already started which helps statistical software like MAPS which stands for Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics. MAPS aims to complete six objectives, which include these three;
* Planning statistical systems and preparing national statistical development strategies for all low-income countries
* Ensuring full participation of developing countries
* Setting up the International Household Survey Network, a global collection of household-based socioeconomic data sets
For people traveling on flights, a source of data is the International Air Transportation Association (IATA) which has been collecting data on about 90% of global air traffic on a monthly basis since 2000. This data allowed researchers and professionals to view the ability of disease to spread from certain location on Earth. Ships carry about 90% of global trade; in 2001, the Automatic Identification system was implemented to record the "comings and goings of sea traffic".

'''Reuterin''' is a potent [[antibiotics|antimicrobial]] multi-compound produced by ''[[Lactobacillus reuteri]]'', during the metabolism of [[glycerol]] to [[1,3-propanediol]] catalysed by the [[coenzyme B12]]-dependent diol dehydrase. Reuterin consists of 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde, its hydrate, its dehydration product ([[acrolein]]), and its dimer in dynamic equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/jr9500000490 |vauthors=Hall RH, Stern ES |title=Acid-catalysed hydration of acrylalde.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1262">A '''''roman à tiroirs''''' (French for "novel with/made of drawers") is a French term for a novel in which the principal or main [[narrative]] (or "[[frame story]]") is interrupted by secondary narratives (involving secondary characters and/or told by other narrators), which may in turn themselves be interrupted by further narratives/narrators.  As such, it is a form of the "[[story within a story]]" [[literary device]] in which the fiction is nested in two or more layers and where the resolution of the main narrative is delayed because of the inserted secondary tales/stories.  In French, the embedded narratives are referred to as ''récits enchâssés'' or ''récits emboités''.

The expression "à tiroirs" as applied to a work of literature dates from 1752, and appears to have been used originally in reference to theater and plays (a "pièce à tiroirs" or "comédie à tiroirs").&lt;ref&gt;''"Romans à tiroirs" d'hier et d'aujourd'hui: Parodie et experimentation romanesque."''

'''SA Pathology''', (formerly the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS) until 2008), is an organisation providing diagnostic and clinical pathology services throughout [[South Australia]].

SA Pathology has over 60 patient collection centres and numerous [[Laboratory|laboratories]] located throughout South Australia.

As a [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit organisation]], SA Pathology bulk-bills patients for all Commonwealth Medical Benefit Schedule (CMBS) pathology tests.  In a recent article by [http://www.choice.com.au/reviews-and-tests/food-and-health/general-health/health-practitioners/pathology-gap-fees/page.aspx Choice magazine], it was recognised as the only consistently 'no gap, [[bulk billing]]' pathology provider in South Australia.

Profits generated from pathology are used to support rural communities, [[Medical education|medical training]] and [[medical research]]. SA Pathology has over 250 elite medical researchers studying diseases and disorders ranging from [[Blood cancer|blood]], [[Breast cancer|breast]] and [[colon cancer]], [[bone fracture]]s, [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[asthma]], [[hepatitis]], [[infectious disease]]s and [[genetic disorder]]s.

==History==
SA Pathology has a rich history of diagnostic pathology and research over 75 years. Established as the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS) in the late 1930s, it was an era which saw political and community leaders introduce significant reform, with a focus on improving public health.

Situated near the old [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]], in what used to be South Australia's principal [[teaching hospital]] precinct, the Institute began as an offshoot of the hospital laboratories. RAH Superintendent and Dean of Medicine Sir [[Trent Champion de Crespigny]] created an organisation combining laboratory services with pathology training and medical research. Dr. [[E. Weston Hurst]] was appointed its first director in 1937,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131566423 |title=Surprise Bill in Assembly |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)]] |volume=XXIX, |issue=4,479 |location=South Australia |date=30 November 1937 |accessdate=20 August 2018 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48765147 |title=Medical Institute Director Resigns |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)]] |volume=LXXXVI, |issue=26488 |location=South Australia |date=27 August 1943 |accessdate=20 August 2018 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes occurred in the 1970s with a redefinition of IMVS services, resulting in the divisions of Forensic Pathology and Biology relocating and evolving into what is now the Forensic Science Centre. The 1980s saw stronger relationships with the RAH and the [[University of Adelaide]] which allowed the IMVS to diversify activity across emerging areas of pathology.

A later review recommended creation of separate science research laboratories, proposing that any new developments be integrated into IMVS and the hospital, which led to the establishment of the Hanson Institute in the early 1990s.

The IMVS experienced further change in 2008 in a merger with the pathology department of two other hospitals, the [[Women's and Children's Hospital]] and [[Flinders Medical Centre|Flinders Medical Centre's]] South Path, when the organisation was renamed SA Pathology. The core business continued to be diagnostic pathology for public health but adhering to its founder’s original vision, integrating pathology with clinical training and medical research.

The Centre for Cancer Biology was established within SA Pathology in 2008 as a hub for innovative science. Currently hosting over twenty group leaders and their teams, the CCB is an internationally recognised cancer research centre where research teams actively form alliances with pharmaceutical companies to foster knowledge and advance new treatments.

'''Science Learning Centres''' are a [[UK Government]] initiative to address the need for improved [[science education]] and development for teachers in England.

==Origins==
In 2001, the House of Lords Science &amp; Technology Select Committee Report&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldsctech/47/4702.htm/&lt;/ref&gt; identified an urgent need for subject specific Continuing Professional Development for Science Teachers. In response to this and numerous other calls for action, the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]] and the [[Wellcome Trust]]  invested £51 million in the creation of the '''national network of Science Learning Centres'''.  After a competitive tendering process the first Science Learning Centre opened its doors in October 2004. Today the Centres are more than just a location for training courses, they are rapidly becoming the focus for all science education activity in the UK.

==Continuing professional development==
'''Science Learning Centres''' run courses that provide continuing [[professional development]] for ''anyone'' involved in the teaching of science, from those working with reception aged children to post 16 students, including primary and secondary teachers, technicians, teaching assistants and FE lecturers.

The aim of all '''Science Learning Centres''' is to reconnect teachers with the frontiers of their subject and the latest techniques for teaching it. Teachers who attend courses are given the opportunity to renew and extend their teaching skills by mixing with and learning from colleagues who face similar challenges to their own, and have access to the UK’s leading experts in science educational research.

==Centres==
There are '''10 Science Learning Centres''' around the country.  One to serve each of the nine English government regions and a '''National Science Learning Centre''' (based in the University of York) which provides training for anyone from England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.  Each Centre is run by a consortium of organisations, which vary from local councils and professional bodies to universities, schools, science centres and industry partners.

*The National Science Learning Centre, located in York
*Science Learning Centre East of England, located in Hertfordshire
*Science Learning Centre East Midlands, located in Leicester
*Science Learning Centre London
*Science Learning Centre North East, located in Durham
*Science Learning Centre North West, located in Manchester

*Science Learning Centre South West, located in Bristol
*Science Learning Centre West Midlands, located in Keele
*Science Learning Centre Yorkshire &amp; the Humber, located in Sheffield

==Courses==
The courses offered at the regional Centres usually feature one day’s training at the Centre, together with ongoing support through classroom exercises and online materials.  The '''National Science Learning Centre''', based at the [[University of York]], offers residential courses for teachers, providing access to the facilities for teachers of two or more days, often spread across more than one term.

==Ambitions==
The national network of Science Learning Centres has been created with ambitious goals in mind; not least to help British teachers, lecturers, technicians and classroom assistants to lead the world in science education by 2015.

'''Macromolecular structure validation''' is the process of evaluating reliability for 3-dimensional atomic models of large biological molecules such as [[proteins]] and [[nucleic acids]]. These models, which provide 3D coordinates for each atom in the molecule (see example in the image), come from [[structural biology]] experiments such as [[x-ray crystallography]]&lt;ref name="Rupp"&gt;{{harvnb|Rupp|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR).&lt;ref name="Cavanagh"&gt;{{harvnb|Cavanagh
|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The validation has three aspects: 1) checking on the validity of the thousands to millions of measurements in the experiment; 2) checking how consistent the atomic model is with those experimental data; and 3) checking consistency of the model with known physical and chemical properties.

Proteins and nucleic acids are the workhorses of biology, providing the necessary chemical reactions, structural organization, growth, mobility, reproduction, and environmental sensitivity. Essential to their biological functions are the detailed 3D structures of the molecules and the changes in those structures. To understand and control those functions, we need accurate knowledge about the models that represent those structures, including their many strong points and their occasional weaknesses.

End-users of macromolecular models include clinicians, teachers and students, as well as the structural biologists themselves, journal editors and [[referee]]s, experimentalists studying the macromolecules by other techniques, and theoreticians and [[bioinformatics|bioinformaticians]] studying more general properties of biological molecules. Their interests and requirements vary, but all benefit greatly from a global and local understanding of the reliability of the models.

==Historical summary==
Macromolecular crystallography was preceded by the older field of small-molecule [[x-ray crystallography]] (for structures with less than a few hundred atoms). Small-molecule [[diffraction]] data extends to much higher [[Resolution (electron density)|resolution]] than feasible for macromolecules, and has a very clean mathematical relationship between the data and the atomic model.  The residual, or R-factor, measures the agreement between the experimental data and the values back-calculated from the atomic model.  For a well-determined small-molecule structure the R-factor is nearly as small as the uncertainty in the experimental data (well under 5%).  Therefore, that one test by itself provides most of the validation needed, but a number of additional consistency and methodology checks are done by automated software&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Spek AL |year=2003 |title=Single-crystal structure validation with the program PLATON |journal=Journal of Applied Crystallography |volume= 36 |pages=7–13 |doi=10.1107/S0021889802022112}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a requirement for small-molecule crystal structure papers submitted to the [[International Union of Crystallography]] (IUCr) journals such as [[Acta Crystallographica]] section B or C. Atomic coordinates of these small-molecule structures are archived and accessed through the [[Cambridge Structural Database]] (CSD)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Allen FH |year=2002 |title=The Cambridge Structural Database: a quarter of a million crystal structures and rising |journal=Acta Crystallographica B|volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=380–388 |doi=10.1107/S0108768102003890}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Crystallography Open Database]] (COD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grazulis S |author2=Chateigner D |author3=Downs RT|author4=Yokochi AT |author5=Quiros M|author6=Lutterotti L |author7=Manakova E|author8=Butkus J |author9=Moeck, P |author10=Le Bail, A |year=2009 |title=Crystallography Open Database – an open-access collection of crystal structures |journal= Journal of Applied Crystallography |volume= 42 |issue=4 |pages=726–729 |doi=10.1107/s0021889809016690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first macromolecular validation software was developed around 1990, for proteins. It included Rfree [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] for model-to-data match,&lt;ref name="Rfree"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brunger AT |author-link=Axel T.

===Overall considerations===

====Global vs local criteria====
Many evaluation criteria apply globally to an entire experimental structure, most notably the [[Resolution (electron density)|resolution]], the [[anisotropy]] or incompleteness of the data, and the residual or R-factor that measures overall model-to-data match (see below).  Those help a user choose the most accurate among related [[Protein Data Bank]] entries to answer their questions.  Other criteria apply to individual residues or local regions in the 3D structure, such as fit to the local [[electron density]] map or steric clashes between atoms.  Those are especially valuable to the structural biologist for making improvements to the model, and to the user for evaluating the reliability of that model right around the place they care about - such as a site of enzyme activity or drug binding.  Both types of measures are very useful, but although global criteria are easier to state or publish, local criteria make the greatest contribution to scientific accuracy and biological relevance.  As expressed in the Rupp textbook, "Only local validation, including assessment of both geometry and electron density, can give an accurate picture of the reliability of the structure model or any hypothesis based on local features of the model."&lt;ref name="BRuppCh13"&gt;{{harvnb|Rupp|2009|loc=Chapter 13, Key Concepts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data Validation: Chemical Shifts, NOEs, RDCs===
'''AVS'''.  Assignment validation suite ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14872126 AVS]) checks the chemical shifts list in BioMagResBank (BMRB) format for problems.

[http://psvs-1_4-dev.nesg.org/ PSVS (Protein Structure Validation Server] at the NESG)&lt;ref name="Huang YJ, Powers R and Montelione GT 2005 1665–1674"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Huang YJ, Powers R, Montelione GT |year=2005 |title=Protein NMR recall, precision, and F-measure scores (RPF scores): structure quality assessment measures based on information retrieval statistics |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume= 127 |pages=1665–1674 |doi=10.1021/ja047109h |pmid=15701001 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PROSESS'''. [[PROSESS| PROSESS (Protein Structure Evaluation Suite &amp; Server)]] is a new web server that offers an assessment of protein structural models by NMR chemical shifts as well as NOEs, geometrical, and knowledge-based parameters.

'''LACS'''. Linear analysis of chemical shifts is used for absolute referencing of chemical shift data.

===Model-to-data validation===
'''TALOS+'''. Predicts protein backbone torsion angles from chemical shift data.  Frequently used to generate further restraints applied to a structure model during refinement.

===Model validation: as above===

[[Image:2k5d NMR ensemble ribbons.jpg|thumb|right| NMR structural ensemble for PDB file 2K5D, with well-defined structure for the beta strands (arrows) and undefined, presumably highly mobile regions for the orange loop and the blue N-terminus]]

===Dynamics: core vs loops, tails, and mobile domains===
One of the critical needs for NMR structural ensemble validation is to distinguish well-determined regions (those that have experimental data) from regions that are highly mobile and/or have no observed data.  There are several current or proposed methods for making this distinction such as [[Random Coil Index]], but so far the NMR community has not standardized on one.

==For SAXS (small-angle x-ray scattering)==
SAXS is a rapidly growing area of structure determination, both as a source of approximate 3D structure for initial or difficult cases and as a component of hybrid-method structure determination when combined with NMR, EM, crystallographic, cross-linking, or computational information.  There is great interest in the development of reliable validation standards for SAXS data interpretation and for quality of the resulting models, but there are as yet no established methods in general use. Three recent steps in this direction are the creation of a Small-Angle Scattering Validation Task Force committee by the worldwide Protein DataBank and its initial report,&lt;ref name="sasVTF"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Trewhella J, Hendrickson WA, Kleywegt GJ, Sali A, Sato M, Schwede T, Svergun DI, Tainer JA, Westbrook J, Berman HM |title=Report of the wwPDB Small-Angle Scattering Task Force: Data requirements for biomolecular modeling and the PDB structure |journal=Structure |year=2013 |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=875–881 |doi=10.1016/j.str.2013.04.020 |pmid=23747111}}&lt;/ref&gt; a set of suggested standards for data inclusion in publications,&lt;ref name="Jacques2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacques DA, Guss JM, Svergun DI, Trewhella J |title=Publication guidelines for structural modelling of small-angle scattering data from biomolecules in solution |journal=Acta Crystallographica D |volume=68 |issue=6 |year=2012 |pages=620–626 |doi=10.1107/S0907444912012073 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an initial proposal of statistically derived criteria for automated quality evaluation.&lt;ref name="Grant2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Grant TD |author2=Luft JR |author3=Carter LG |author4=Matsui T |author5=Weiss ™ |author6=Martel A |author7=Snell EH |title=The accurate assessment of small-angle X-ray scattering data |journal=Acta Crystallographica D |volume=71 |year=2015 |pages=45–56 |doi=10.1107/S1399004714010876 |pmc=4304685 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==For computational biology==
It is difficult to do meaningful validation of an individual, purely computational, macromolecular model in the absence of experimental data for that molecule, because the model with the best geometry and conformational score may not be the one closest to the right answer.  Therefore, much of the emphasis in validation of computational modeling is in assessment of the methods.  To avoid bias and wishful thinking, double-blind prediction competitions have been organized, the original example of which (held every 2 years since 1994) is [[CASP]] (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) to evaluate predictions of 3D protein structure for newly solved [[x-ray crystallography|crystallographic]] or [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] structures held in confidence until the end of the relevant competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moult, J.|year=1995 |title=A large-scale experiment to assess protein structure prediction methods |journal=Proteins |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=ii–iv |doi=10.1002/prot.340230303|display-authors=etal |pmid=8710822|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1229334/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major criterion for CASP evaluation is a weighted score called GDT-TS for the match of Calpha positions between the predicted and the experimental models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/nar/gkg571 |author=Zemla, A. |year=2003 |title=LGA: a method for finding 3D similarities in protein structures |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=31 |issue=13 |pages=3370–4 |pmid=12824330 |pmc=168977 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception or Mystic Christianity''''' (also known as '''''Western Wisdom Teachings''''') is a [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] text by [[Max Heindel]], first published in 1909.

== Publication history ==
The first edition was printed in November 1909. The order of publication was placed by Max Heindel on the [[New Moon]]&lt;ref&gt;Note: The ''new moon'' is important in [[astrology]], as is the ''full moon''.&lt;/ref&gt; of November 1909 and the book was published a couple of weeks later by the [[Full Moon]], some 5 short weeks before the end of the first decade of the 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;Jean de Galzain. Online [RF Friends] announcement of the 100-year centenary of the ''Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception'' and celebration events at [[Mount Ecclesia]] on the weekend of November 13–14-15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It has little changed since then and it is considered to be Max Heindel's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''. It is a reference work in the [[Christian mysticism]] practice and in the [[Occult]] study literature, containing the fundamentals of [[Esoteric Christianity]] from a Rosicrucian perspective. The ''Cosmo'' contains a comprehensive outline of the evolutionary process of man and the [[universe]], correlating science with religion. It is, till current days, the basic book for the philosophy courses of the school, the [[Rosicrucian Fellowship]], founded by the author on August 8, 1909.

=== The first dedicatory ===
The first edition of this work, containing more than 700 pages of in depth teachings into the major themes of the ''occult science'', was dedicated to a knowledgeable lecturer of the occult field called [[Rudolf Steiner]], to whom Max Heindel felt greatly indebted. It had the subtitle "Occult Science" instead of "Mystic Christianity" and just above the message and mission ("A Sane Mind, a Soft Heart and a Sound Body", "Service") there was a quotation from [[Paul of Tarsus]]: "PROVE ALL THINGS".
In the subsequent edition, Heindel removed the initial dedication and changed the mentioned elements. The first dedication became a controversial issue among some students of both teachers down to the present. However, as both Heindel and Steiner appear to have been influenced by the same Elder Brother of the [[Rose Cross]], to some extent and at some stage of their lives, it becomes an accessory issue that may only be unveiled through the discernment of the student along her/his path of [[spirituality|spiritual]] unfoldment.

== Contents overview ==
The author talks about the true man and his journey through [[Involution (esoterism)|involution]], [[spiritual evolution]] and epigenesis, presenting practical methods to help the development of latent potentials in each one of us and how to transmute our latency into dynamic powers in order to achieve, according to the author, direct knowledge and conscientious work in the [[Plane (cosmology)|inner planes]].

It deals with many esoteric topics and also [[metaphysics]], [[physiology]] and [[cosmology]] (the visible and invisible worlds, human evolution, [[reincarnation|death and rebirth]], nutrition, esoteric training, ...). It contains a history of the evolution of the human spirit and related bodies (from before awareness, through various incarnations of our planet on various planes, and into the future development) and of animal, vegetable and mineral life waves (the myriad life forms and types of consciousness on this physical plane, experiencing their own points in evolution). It also presents an [[Esoteric knowledge|esoteric interpretation]] about the mission of Christ and an [[occult]] analysis of [[Bible|Biblical]] texts which include the fall of man, the [[Karma|Law of Cause and Consequence]] and Bible and rebirth, and many other themes which were further developed in the subsequent books, lectures and lessons given by the author at the time (1910s) in the United States.

=== Main themes ===
''The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception'' is divided in three parts:&lt;br/&gt;
Part I: the Visible and the Invisible Worlds, Man and the Method of Evolution, Rebirth and the Law of Cause and Effect; &lt;br/&gt;
Part II: the scheme of Evolution in general and the Evolution of the Solar System and the Earth in particular; &lt;br/&gt;
Part III: Christ and His Mission, Future Development of Man and Initiation, Esoteric Training and a Safe Method of Acquiring Firsthand Knowledge.

== The Rosicrucian conception of God and the scheme of evolution ==
According to the ''Western Wisdom Teachings'', in the beginning of a ''Day of Manifestation'' a certain collective Great Being, God, limits Himself to a certain portion of space, in which He elects to create a [[Solar System]] for the evolution of added [[self (philosophy)|self]]-[[consciousness]].
[[File:Europe a Prophecy, copy D, object 1 (Bentley 1, Erdman i, Keynes i) British Museum.jpg|right|thumb|210px|''[[The Ancient of Days]]'', illustrated by [[William Blake]] (1794)]]
&lt;!---"Both poet and artist, Blake illustrated his own poetic work. He also labored to create his own cosmology and mythology, based upon his readings of the Bible, the teachings of Swedenborg, and his own besetting visions. This illustration suggests a gnostic approach to the Creator as a lesser, fallible God, though the visual suggestion of compasses, which Blake associated with materialism and a constricted, Newtonian view of reality."---&gt;
In God there are contained hosts of glorious Hierarchies and lesser beings of every grade of intelligence and stage of [[consciousness]], from [[omniscience]] to an [[unconsciousness]] deeper than that of the deepest [[altered state of consciousness|trance condition]].
During the current period of manifestation these various grades of beings are working to acquire more experience than they possessed at the beginning of this period of existence. Those who, in previous manifestations, have attained the highest degree of development work on those who have not yet evolved any consciousness.

The period of time devoted to the attainment of self-consciousness and to the building of the [[Subtle body|vehicles]] through which the spirit in man manifests, is called "[[Involution (esoterism)|Involution]]". The succeeding period of existence, during which the individual human being develops ''[[self-consciousness]]'' into ''[[divinity|divine]] [[omniscience]]'', is called "[[Spiritual evolution|Evolution]]". Every evolving being has within him a "force" which makes evolution not to be a mere enfoldment of latent germinal possibilities but a process where each individual differ from that of every other. This force, called "Epigenesis", provides the element of [[originality]] and gives scope to the creative ability which the evolving being is to cultivate that he may become a God.

''The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception'' describes that in the [[Solar system]], God's Habitation, there are [[Rosicrucian Fellowship#The Seven Worlds .26 the Seven Cosmic Planes|seven Worlds]] differentiated by God, within Himself, one after another.&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception''; Diagram 2: [http://www.rosicrucian.com/images/rccen002.gif The Seven Worlds]&lt;/ref&gt; These Worlds have each a different "measure" and rate of [[oscillation|vibration]] and are not separated by [[space]] or [[distance]], as is the earth from the other planets. They are states of [[matter]], of varying [[density]] and [[vibration]] (as are the solids, liquids and gases of the physical [[Earth]]). These Worlds are not instantaneously created at the beginning of a day of Manifestation, nor do they last until the end. The evolutionary scheme is carried through five of these Worlds in seven great Periods of manifestation, during which the evolving virgin [[spirit]] becomes first human and then a God.
The highest Worlds are created first, and as involution is to slowly carry the life into denser and denser matter for the building of forms, the finer Worlds gradually [[condense]] and new Worlds are differentiated within God to furnish the necessary links between Himself and the Worlds which have consolidated. In due time the point of greatest density, the [[nadir]] of materiality, is reached. From that point the life begins to ascend into higher Worlds, as [[Spiritual evolution|evolution]] proceeds. That leaves the denser Worlds depopulated, one by one. When the purpose has been served for which a particular World was created, God ends its existence, which has become superfluous, by ceasing within Himself the particular activity which brought into being and sustained that World.&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''Idem''; Diagram 8: [http://www.rosicrucian.com/images/rccen008.gif The 7 7 7 Incarnations]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{God|by religion}}
The Rosicrucians teach that the above referred seven Worlds belong to the lowest of the seven "Cosmic Planes". The Worlds and Cosmic Planes are not one above another in space, but the seven Cosmic Planes inter-penetrate each other and all the seven Worlds. They are states of [[spirit]]-[[matter]], permeating one another, so that God and the other great Beings pervade every part of their own realms and realms of greater density than their own, including our world: "''in Him we live and move and have our being''". Proceeding from the [[physical plane|physical world]] to the [[Plane (cosmology)|inner worlds]], '''God''' - the "Architect of the Solar System", the Source and goal of human existence&amp;nbsp;– is found in the highest division of the seventh Cosmic Plane: this is His World. In order to trace the origin of the Architect of the Solar System, one must pass to the highest of the seven Cosmic Planes: the "Realm of the '''Supreme Being'''", Who emanated from "The Absolute". '''The Absolute''' is beyond comprehension and, as [[wikt:manifestation|manifestation]] implies limitation, He may be best described as "Boundless Being": the "Root of Existence".

From [[The Absolute]] proceeds the [[Supreme Being]], at the dawn of manifestation: this is ''The One'', the "[[Great Architect of the Universe]]". The first aspect of the Supreme Being may be characterized as ''Power'', from this proceeds the second aspect, ''the Word'', and from both of these proceeds the third, aspect, ''Motion''. From the threefold Supreme Being proceed the "seven Great [[Logos|Logoi]]". They contain within Themselves all the great Hierarchies which differentiate more and more as they diffuse through the various Cosmic Planes.&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''Idem''; Diagram 6: [http://www.rosicrucian.com/images/rccen006.gif The Supreme Being, the Cosmic Planes and God]&lt;/ref&gt; In the Highest World of the seventh Cosmic Plane dwells the God of the [[Planetary system|Solar Systems]] in the [[Universe]]. These great Beings are also threefold in manifestation, like the Supreme Being. Their three aspects are ''Will'', ''Wisdom'' and ''Activity''.

== Comments about the ''Cosmo'' ==

=== The author's perspective ===

By Max Heindel in ''A Word to the Wise'':

*''If the book is "weighed and found wanting," the writer will have no complaint. He only fears a hasty judgment based upon lack of knowledge of the system he advocates—a hearing wherein the judgment is "wanting" in consequence of having been denied an impartial "weighing." He would further submit, that the only opinion worthy of the one who expresses '''it must be based upon knowledge.'''''
*''Yet he is convinced that The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception is far from being the last word on the subject.''
*''The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception is not dogmatic, neither does it appeal to any other authority than the reason of the student.''
*''The Rosicrucian Brotherhood has the most far-reaching, the most logical conception of the World-Mystery (...)''
*''It is emphatically stated that '''this work embodies only the writer's understanding of the Rosicrucian teachings''' concerning the World-Mystery (...)''
*''What is said in this work is to be accepted or rejected by the reader according to his own discretion.''
---
*Now, perhaps you will understand my attitude towards the Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception. I admire and marvel at its wonderful teaching more than anyone else, and can do so without violating proper modesty for the book is not mine—it belongs to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;The Rosicrucian Fellowship.

=== A critical essay ===

By Charles Weber in ''The Mystic and Occult in Max Heindel's Writings'':&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Charles. ''[http://www.fraternidaderosacruz.org/rc_cw_maoimht.htm The Mystic and Occult in Max Heindel's Writings]''. Accessed in February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

*The Cosmo’s author has "an unswerving desire, a burning thirst for knowledge", which is "the first and central requisite the aspirant to occult knowledge must possess", but with this qualification, that "the supreme motive for seeking this occult knowledge must be an ardent desire to benefit humanity" (22). "Another prerequisite to this first-hand knowledge, however, is the study of occultism second-hand" (23). It is the purpose of the Cosmo to make that second-hand study of occultism possible. Occult science is the science of what occurs occultly insofar as it is not perceived in external nature, but in that region toward which the soul turns when it directs its inner being toward the spirit.
*Heindel emphasizes the facticity of the Cosmo’s contents and the rigor and objectivity of his sources by using the term occult scientist(s) thirty times and occult science twenty-five times. The occultist (used twenty times) "knows" and "sees" what he is reporting on. "The occult scientist uses concentration in preference to prayer because the former is accomplished by the aid of the mind, which is cold and unfeeling, whereas prayer is usually dictated by emotion" (463). That is, concentration is more impersonal, and therefore more reliable. However, when emotion is replaced by a mystic’s "pure unselfish devotion to high ideals, prayer is much higher than cold concentration" (ibid).

'''Water pollution''' is the contamination of [[Body of water|water bodies]], usually as a result of human activities. Water bodies include for example [[lake]]s, [[river]]s, [[marine pollution|ocean]]s, [[aquifer]]s and [[groundwater]]. Water pollution results when [[Contaminant|contaminants]] are introduced into the natural environment. For example, releasing inadequately treated [[wastewater]] into natural water bodies can lead to [[environmental degradation|degradation]] of [[aquatic ecosystems]]. In turn, this can lead to [[public health]] problems for people living downstream. They may use the same polluted river water for drinking or bathing or [[irrigation]]. Water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and disease, e.g. due to [[Waterborne diseases|water-borne diseases]].&lt;ref name="death2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="death" /&gt;

Water pollution can be grouped into [[surface water]] pollution. [[Marine pollution]] and [[nutrient pollution]] are subsets of water pollution. Sources of water pollution are either point sources and non-point sources. Point sources have one identifiable cause of the pollution, such as a [[storm drain]], [[wastewater treatment plant]] or stream. Non-point sources are more diffuse, such as [[Surface runoff|agricultural runoff]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pollution is the result of the cumulative effect over time. All plants and organisms living in or being exposed to polluted [[bodies of water|water bodies]] can be impacted. The effects can damage individual [[species]] and impact the natural [[Biocoenosis|biological communities]] they are part of.   

The causes of water pollution include a wide range of [[chemical]]s and [[pathogen]]s as well as physical parameters. Contaminants may include [[organic compound|organic]] and [[inorganic]] substances. Elevated temperatures can also lead to polluted water. A common cause of [[thermal pollution]] is the use of water as a [[coolant]] by [[power plants]] and industrial manufacturers. Elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels, which can kill fish and alter [[food chain]] composition, reduce species [[biodiversity]], and foster invasion by new [[thermophilic]] species.&lt;ref name="Goel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laws-aquatic" /&gt;{{rp|375}}   

Water pollution is measured by analysing water samples. Physical, chemical and biological tests can be done. Control of water pollution requires appropriate [[Infrastructure|infrastructure]] and management plans. The infrastructure may include [[wastewater treatment plants]]. [[Sewage treatment|Sewage treatment plants]] and [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] treatment plants are usually required to protect water bodies from untreated wastewater. [[Agricultural wastewater treatment]] for farms, and [[erosion control]] from construction sites can also help prevent water pollution. [[Nature-based solutions]] are another approach to prevent water pollution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Effective control of urban runoff includes reducing speed and quantity of flow. In the United States, [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices for water pollution]] include approaches to reduce the quantity of water and improve [[water quality]].&lt;ref name="EPA-PDS" /&gt;

==Introduction==
[[File:Canal-pollution.jpg|thumb|Pollution in the [[Lachine Canal]], Canada]]
Water is typically referred to as polluted when it is impaired by [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] contaminants. Due to these contaminants it either does not support a human use, such as [[drinking water]], or undergoes a marked shift in its ability to support its biotic communities, such as fish. Natural phenomena such as [[volcano]]es, [[algae bloom]]s, storms, and earthquakes also cause major changes in water quality and the ecological status of water.

Water pollution is a major global problem. It requires ongoing evaluation and revision of [[water resource policy]] at all levels (international down to individual aquifers and wells). It has been suggested that water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and diseases,&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/columnist/article/trenddesk/3748 |author=Pink, Daniel H. |publisher=Yahoo |title=Investing in Tomorrow's Liquid Gold |date=April 19, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423172532/https://finance.yahoo.com/columnist/article/trenddesk/3748 |archivedate=April 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="death2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://environment.about.com/od/environmentalevents/a/waterdayqa.htm |author=West, Larry |publisher=About.com |title=World Water Day: A Billion People Worldwide Lack Safe Drinking Water |date=2006-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it accounts for the deaths of more than 14,000 people daily.&lt;ref name="death2" /&gt; 

India and China are two countries with high levels of water pollution: An estimated 580 people in [[India]] die of water pollution related illness (including [[waterborne diseases]]) every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inclentrust.org/uploadedbyfck/file/Diarrhoea-Pneumonia/Lecture%203_1%20Burden%20of%20diarrhea%20in%20children%20in%20India%20-12th%20dec.pdf |title=An overview of diarrhea, symptoms, diagnosis and the costs of morbidity |year=2010 |work=CHNRI |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512231350/http://www.inclentrust.org/uploadedbyfck/file/Diarrhoea-Pneumonia/Lecture%203_1%20Burden%20of%20diarrhea%20in%20children%20in%20India%20-12th%20dec.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 90 percent of the [[Water resources of China|water in the cities of China]] is polluted.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-06/07/content_449451.htm China says water pollution so severe that cities could lack safe supplies]". Chinadaily.com.cn.

In addition to the acute problems of water pollution in [[developing country|developing countries]], [[developed countries]] also continue to struggle with pollution problems. For example, in a report on [[water quality]] in the [[United States]] in 2009, 44 percent of assessed stream miles, 64 percent of assessed lake acres, and 30 percent of assessed [[bays]] and [[estuary|estuarine]] square miles were classified as polluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=January 2009 |title=Fact Sheet: 2004 National Water Quality Inventory Report to Congress |url=https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/2004-national-water-quality-inventory-report-congress |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-F-08-003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Surface water pollution ===
{{see also|Nutrient pollution}}
Surface water pollution includes pollution of rivers, lakes and oceans. A subset of surface water pollution is [[marine pollution]].

=== Marine pollution ===
{{Main|Marine pollution}}
[[File:AngleseyCopperStream.jpg|thumb|upright|A polluted river draining an abandoned [[copper mine]] on Anglesey]]

One common path of entry by [[Contaminant|contaminants]] to the sea are rivers. An example is directly discharging sewage and industrial waste into the ocean. Pollution such as this occurs particularly in developing nations.  

Large [[gyre]]s ([[vortex]]es) in the oceans trap floating [[plastic debris]]. Plastic debris can absorb toxic chemicals from ocean pollution, potentially poisoning any creature that eats it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zaikab|first=Gwyneth Dickey|date=2011-03-28|title=Marine microbes digest plastic|url=|journal=Nature|publisher=Macmillan|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=10.1038/news.2011.191|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these long-lasting pieces end up in the stomachs of marine birds and animals. This results in obstruction of digestive pathways, which leads to reduced appetite or even starvation.

There are a variety of secondary effects stemming not from the original pollutant, but a derivative condition. An example is [[silt]]-bearing [[surface runoff]], which can inhibit the penetration of sunlight through the water column, hampering [[photosynthesis]] in aquatic plants.

===Groundwater pollution===
{{Main|Groundwater pollution}}
Interactions between [[groundwater]] and [[surface water]] are complex. Consequently, groundwater pollution, also referred to as groundwater contamination, is not as easily classified as surface water pollution.&lt;ref name="circ1139" /&gt; By its very nature, groundwater [[aquifer]]s are susceptible to contamination from sources that may not directly affect surface water bodies. The distinction of point vs. non-point source may be irrelevant. 

Analysis of groundwater contamination may focus on [[soil]] characteristics and site geology, [[hydrogeology]], [[hydrology]], and the nature of the contaminants. Causes of groundwater pollution include: naturally-occurring (geogenic), [[Sanitation#Onsite sanitation|on-site sanitation]] systems, [[sewage]], [[fertilizers]] and [[pesticide]], commercial and industrial leaks, [[hydraulic fracturing]], [[landfill leachate]].

==Categories of pollution sources==
Surface water and [[groundwater]] have often been studied and managed as separate resources even though they are interrelated.&lt;ref name="circ1139"&gt;United States Geological Survey (USGS), Denver, CO (1998). [http://pubs.water.usgs.gov/circ1139/ "Ground Water and Surface Water: A Single Resource."] Circular 1139.&lt;/ref&gt; Surface water seeps through the soil and becomes groundwater. Conversely, groundwater can also feed surface water sources. Sources of surface water pollution are generally grouped into two categories based on their origin.

===Point sources===
[[File:Jacuecanga Angra dos Reis Rio de Janeiro Brazil Brasfels.JPG|thumb|Point source pollution at a [[shipyard]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil.]]

{{Further|United States regulation of point source water pollution}}

[[Point source water pollution]] refers to contaminants that enter a waterway from a single, identifiable source, such as a [[water pipe|pipe]] or [[ditch]]. Examples of sources in this category include discharges from a [[Sewage treatment|sewage treatment plant]], a factory, or a city [[storm drain]]. 

The U.S. [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) defines point source for [[regulation|regulatory]] enforcement purposes.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act (CWA), section 502(14), {{USC|33|1362}} (14).&lt;/ref&gt; The CWA definition of point source was amended in 1987 to include municipal storm sewer systems, as well as industrial storm water, such as from construction sites.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. CWA section 402(p), {{USC|33|1342(p)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-point sources===
[[Nonpoint source pollution]] refers to diffuse contamination that does not originate from a single discrete source. This type of pollution is often the cumulative effect of small amounts of contaminants gathered from a large area. A common example is the leaching out of [[nitrogen]] compounds from fertilized agricultural lands.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moss |first1=Brian |title=Water Pollution by Agriculture |journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B |date=2008 |volume=363 |pages=659–666 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2007.2176 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brian_Moss2/publication/6173580_Water_Pollution_by_Agriculture/links/53d607050cf220632f3d6bf2.pdf|pmc=2610176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrient [[surface runoff|runoff]] in [[stormwater|storm water]] from "sheet flow" over an [[agricultural field]] or a forest are also cited as examples of non-point source pollution.

[[File:Yellow Fish.jpg|thumb|Blue drain and yellow fish symbol used by the UK Environment Agency to raise awareness of the ecological impacts of contaminating surface drainage]]Contaminated storm water washed off of [[parking lot]]s, roads and highways, called [[urban runoff]], is sometimes included  under the category of non-point sources. However, because this runoff is typically channeled into storm drain systems and discharged through pipes to local surface waters, it becomes a point source.

==Contaminants and their sources==
{{Further|Wastewater|Sewage|Industrial wastewater}}

The specific contaminants leading to pollution in water include a wide spectrum of [[chemical]]s, [[pathogen]]s, and physical changes such as elevated temperature and discoloration. While many of the chemicals and substances that are regulated may be naturally occurring ([[calcium]], [[sodium]], iron, [[manganese]], etc.) the [[concentration]] usually determines what is a natural component of water and what is a contaminant. High concentrations of naturally occurring substances can have negative impacts on aquatic flora and fauna.

[[Oxygen]]-depleting substances may be natural materials such as plant matter (e.g. leaves and grass) as well as man-made chemicals. Other natural and anthropogenic substances may cause [[turbidity]] (cloudiness) which blocks light and disrupts plant growth, and clogs the [[gill]]s of some fish species.&lt;ref name="EPA-AGFact"&gt;EPA. [https://www.epa.gov/polluted-runoff-nonpoint-source-pollution/nonpoint-source-fact-sheets "Protecting Water Quality from Agricultural Runoff."] Fact Sheet No. EPA-841-F-05-001. March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alteration of water's physical chemistry includes acidity (change in [[pH]]), [[electrical conductivity]], temperature, and [[eutrophication]]. Eutrophication is an increase in the concentration of chemical nutrients in an [[ecosystem]] to an extent that increases the [[Primary production|primary productivity]] of the ecosystem. Depending on the degree of eutrophication, subsequent negative environmental effects such as [[Anoxic waters|anoxia]] (oxygen depletion) and severe reductions in water quality may occur, affecting fish and other animal populations.

===Pathogens===

===Change in temperature===
{{Main|Thermal pollution}}
Thermal pollution is the rise or fall in the temperature of a natural body of water caused by human influence. Thermal pollution, unlike chemical pollution, results in a change in the physical properties of water. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a [[coolant]] by [[power plants]] and industrial manufacturers. Elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels, which can kill fish and alter [[food chain]] composition, reduce species [[biodiversity]], and foster invasion by new [[thermophilic]] species.&lt;ref name="Goel"&gt;{{cite book |title=Water Pollution - Causes, Effects and Control |last=Goel |first=P.K. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=New Age International |location=New Delhi |isbn=978-81-224-1839-2 |url= |accessdate= |page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennish"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ecology of Estuaries&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; Anthropogenic Effects |last=Kennish |first=Michael J. |series=Marine Science Series |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1992 |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, FL |isbn=978-0-8493-8041-9 |url= |accessdate= |pages=415–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laws-aquatic"/&gt;{{rp|375}} Urban runoff may also elevate temperature in surface waters.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/urban-runoff-additional-resources |title=Protecting Water Quality from Urban Runoff |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=February 2003 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=Fact Sheet. EPA 841-F-03-003.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal pollution can also be caused by the release of very cold water from the base of reservoirs into warmer rivers.

==Measurement==
[[File:Research- water sampling equipment.jpg|thumb|right|[[environmental science|Environmental scientists]] preparing water autosamplers.]]

Water pollution may be analyzed through several broad categories of methods: physical, chemical and biological. Most involve collection of samples, followed by specialized analytical tests. Some methods may be conducted ''[[in situ]]'', without sampling, such as temperature. Government agencies and research organizations have published standardized, validated analytical test methods to facilitate the comparability of results from disparate testing events.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see {{cite book |editor1-last=Baird |editor1-first=Rodger B. |editor2-last=Clesceri |editor2-first=Leonore S. |editor3-last=Eaton |editor3-first=Andrew D. |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Rice |editor4-first=Eugene W. |year=2012 |title=Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater |edition=22nd |url=http://www.standardmethods.org |subscription=yes |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Public Health Association |isbn=978-0875530130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sampling===
Sampling of water for physical or chemical testing can be done by several methods, depending on the accuracy needed and the characteristics of the contaminant. Many contamination events are sharply restricted in time, most commonly in association with rain events. For this reason "grab" samples are often inadequate for fully quantifying contaminant levels. Scientists gathering this type of data often employ auto-sampler devices that pump increments of water at either time or [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] intervals.

Sampling for biological testing involves collection of plants and animals from the surface water body. Depending on the type of assessment, the organisms may be identified for [[biosurvey]]s (population counts) and returned to the water body, or they may be dissected for [[bioassay]]s to determine [[toxicity]].
{{Further|Water quality#Sampling and measurement}}

===Physical testing===
Common physical tests of water include temperature, solids concentrations (e.g., [[total suspended solids]] (TSS)) and turbidity.

===Chemical testing===
{{See also|water chemistry analysis|environmental chemistry}}
Water samples may be examined using the principles of [[analytical chemistry]]. Many published test methods are available for both organic and inorganic compounds. Frequently used methods include [[pH]], [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD),&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=David|title=Chemistry of the Environment|year=2008|publisher=Checkmark Books|isbn=0-8160-7747-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|102}} [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD),&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt;{{rp|104}} nutrients ([[nitrate]] and [[phosphorus]] compounds), metals (including copper, [[zinc]], [[cadmium]], lead and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]), oil and grease, total [[petroleum]] hydrocarbons (TPH), and [[pesticide]]s.

===Biological testing===
{{Main|Bioindicator}}
Biological testing involves the use of plant, animal or microbial indicators to monitor the health of an [[aquatic ecosystem]]. They are any [[indicator species|biological species]] or group of species whose function, population, or status can reveal what degree of ecosystem or environmental integrity is present.&lt;ref name="Karr"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karr |first1=James R. |year=1981 |title=Assessment of biotic integrity using fish communities |journal=Fisheries |volume=6 |issue= |pages=21–27 |url= |doi=10.1577/1548-8446(1981)006&lt;0021:AOBIUF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=1548-8446 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a group of bio-indicators are the [[copepod]]s and other small water [[crustacean]]s that are present in many water bodies. Such organisms can be monitored for changes (biochemical, physiological, or behavioral) that may indicate a problem within their ecosystem.

==Control of pollution==
===Municipal wastewater treatment===
{{Main|Sewage treatment|Wastewater treatment}}
[[File:Deer Island MA.JPG|right|thumb|[[Deer Island Waste Water Treatment Plant|Deer Island Wastewater Treatment Plant]] serving Boston, Massachusetts and vicinity.]]
In urban areas of developed countries, municipal [[wastewater]] (or [[sewage]]) is typically treated by centralized [[sewage treatment plants]]. Well-designed and operated systems (i.e., with secondary treatment steps or more advanced treatment) can remove 90 percent or more of the pollutant load in sewage. Some plants have additional systems to remove [[Nutrient|nutrients]] and pathogens, but these more advanced treatment steps get progressively more expensive.

[[Nature-based solutions]] are also being used instead of (or in combination with) centralized treatment plants.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;UN-Water (2018) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2018/ World Water Development Report 2018: Nature-based Solutions for Water], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

Cities with [[sanitary sewer overflow]]s or [[Combined sewer|combined sewer overflows]] employ one or more [[environmental engineering|engineering]] approaches to reduce discharges of untreated sewage, including:
* utilizing a [[green infrastructure]] approach to improve storm water management capacity throughout the system, and reduce the [[hydraulic]] overloading of the treatment plant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=August 2010 |title=Green Infrastructure Case Studies |chapter=Case Study: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100FTEM.txt |publisher=EPA |pages=49–51 |id=EPA-841-F-10-004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* repair and replacement of leaking and malfunctioning equipment&lt;ref name="EPARTC" /&gt;
* increasing overall hydraulic capacity of the sewage collection system (often a very expensive option).

=== On-site sanitation and safely managed sanitation ===
{{Further|Sanitation}}
Households or businesses not served by a municipal treatment plant may have an individual [[septic tank]], which pre-treats the wastewater on site and infiltrates it into the soil. This can lead to [[groundwater pollution]] if not properly done.

Globally, about 4.5 billion people currently (in 2017) do not have [[Improved sanitation|safely managed sanitation]], according to an estimate by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]].&lt;ref name="JMP2017"&gt;WHO and UNICEF (2017) [https://washdata.org/reports Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines]. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of access to sanitation often leads to water pollution, e.g. via the practice of [[open defecation]]: during rain events or floods, the [[human feces]] are moved from the ground where they were deposited into surface waters. Simple [[pit latrines]] may also get flooded during rain events. The use of safely managed sanitation services would prevent this type of water pollution.&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt;

===Industrial wastewater treatment===
{{Main article|Industrial wastewater treatment}}
[[File:REDOX DAF unit 225 m3-h-1000 GPM.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dissolved air flotation]] system for treating industrial wastewater.]]
Some industrial facilities generate wastewater that is similar to domestic sewage and can be treated by sewage treatment plants. Industries that generate wastewater with high concentrations of organic matter (e.g. oil and grease), toxic pollutants (e.g. heavy metals, volatile organic compounds) or nutrients such as ammonia, need specialized treatment systems. Some industries install a pre-treatment system to remove the pollutants, and then discharge the partially treated [[wastewater]] to the municipal sewer system. Industries generating large volumes of wastewater typically operate their own treatment systems. Some industries have been successful at redesigning their manufacturing processes to reduce or eliminate pollutants, through a process called [[pollution prevention]].

To remove heat from wastewater generated by [[Power station|power plants]] or [[Factory|manufacturing plants]] the following technologies are used:
*[[cooling pond]]s, man-made bodies of water designed for cooling by [[evaporation]], [[convection]], and [[radiation]]
*[[cooling tower]]s, which transfer [[waste heat]] to the [[atmosphere]] through [[evaporation]] or [[heat transfer]]
*[[cogeneration]], a process where waste heat is recycled for domestic or industrial heating purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title=Profile of the Fossil Fuel Electric Power Generation Industry |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=50000H5P.txt |publisher=EPA |date=September 1997 |id=EPA/310-R-97-007 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural wastewater treatment===
{{Main|Agricultural wastewater treatment}}
'''Non point source controls'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Sediment]] (loose [[soil]]) washed off fields is the largest source of [[agricultural pollution]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="EPA-AGFact" /&gt; Farmers may utilize [[erosion control]]s to reduce runoff flows and retain soil on their fields. Common techniques include [[contour plowing]], crop [[mulch]]ing, [[crop rotation]], planting [[perennial]] crops and installing [[riparian buffer]]s.&lt;ref name="NRCS-NCPS"&gt;U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Washington, DC.  [https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/technical/cp/ncps/ "National Conservation Practice Standards."] National Handbook of Conservation Practices.

Nutrients ([[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]) are typically applied to farmland as commercial [[fertilizer]], animal [[manure]], or spraying of municipal or industrial wastewater (effluent) or sludge. Nutrients may also enter runoff from [[crop residue]]s, [[irrigation]] water, [[wildlife]], and [[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|atmospheric deposition]].&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm"&gt;

To minimize pesticide impacts, farmers may use [[Integrated Pest Management]] (IPM) techniques (which can include [[biological pest control]]) to maintain control over pests, reduce reliance on chemical pesticides, and protect water quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/safepestcontrol/integrated-pest-management-ipm-principles |title=Integrated Pest Management Principles |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=Pest Control and Pesticide Safety for Consumers |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Confined-animal-feeding-operation.jpg|thumb|Feedlot in the United States]]
'''Point source wastewater treatment'''&lt;br /&gt;
Farms with large livestock and poultry operations, such as [[factory farm]]s, are called ''concentrated animal feeding operations'' or ''feedlots'' in the US and are being subject to increasing government regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/animal-feeding-operations-afos |title=Animal Feeding Operations |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iowa Department of Natural Resources. Des Moines, IA. [http://www.iowadnr.gov/afo/ "Animal Feeding Operations in Iowa."] Accessed March 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Animal [[slurry|slurries]] are usually treated by containment in [[anaerobic lagoon]]s before disposal by spray or trickle application to grassland. [[Constructed wetland]]s are sometimes used to facilitate treatment of animal wastes. Some animal slurries are treated by mixing with [[straw]] and [[Composting|composted]] at high temperature to produce a bacteriologically sterile and friable manure for soil improvement.

===Erosion and sediment control from construction sites===
[[File:Silt fence EPA.jpg|right|thumb|[[Silt fence]] installed on a construction site.]]
Sediment from construction sites is managed by installation of:
* [[erosion control]]s, such as [[mulch]]ing and [[hydroseeding]], and
* [[sediment control]]s, such as [[sediment basin]]s and [[silt fence]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. Nashville, TN (2012). [http://tnepsc.org/handbook.asp "Tennessee Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Discharge of toxic chemicals such as motor fuels and concrete washout is prevented by use of:
* spill prevention and control plans, and
* specially designed containers (e.g. for concrete washout) and structures such as overflow controls and diversion berms.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite report |date=February 2012 |title=Concrete Washout |series=Stormwater Best Management Practice |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/national-menu-best-management-practices-bmps-stormwater-documents |publisher=EPA |id=BMP fact sheet. EPA 833-F-11-006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control of urban runoff (storm water)===
{{Main|Urban runoff}}
{{See also|Green infrastructure}}
[[File:Trounce Pond.jpg|right|thumb|[[Retention basin]] for controlling [[urban runoff]]]]
Effective control of urban runoff involves reducing the velocity and flow of storm water, as well as reducing pollutant discharges. Local governments use a variety of storm water management techniques to reduce the effects of urban runoff. These techniques, called [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices for water pollution]] (BMPs) in the U.S., may focus on water quantity control, while others focus on improving water quality, and some perform both functions.&lt;ref name="EPA-PDS"&gt;
{{cite report |date=August 1999 |title=Preliminary Data Summary of Urban Storm Water Best Management Practices |chapter=Ch. 5: Description and Performance of Storm Water Best Management Practices |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/industrial-wastewater-studies-miscellaneous |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-821-R-99-012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollution prevention practices include [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low-impact development]] techniques, installation of [[green roof]]s and improved chemical handling (e.g. management of motor fuels &amp; oil, fertilizers and pesticides).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/swbmp/Low-Impact-Development-LID-and-Other-Green-Design-Strategies.cfm |title=Low Impact Development and Other Green Design Strategies |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219220712/http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/swbmp/Low-Impact-Development-LID-and-Other-Green-Design-Strategies.cfm |archive-date=2015-02-19 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Runoff mitigation systems include [[infiltration basin]]s, [[bioretention]] systems, constructed [[wetland]]s, [[retention basin]]s and similar devices.&lt;ref&gt;California Stormwater Quality Association. Menlo Park, CA. [https://www.casqa.org/resources/bmp-handbooks/municipal-bmp-handbook "Municipal BMP Handbook."] 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. Trenton, NJ. [http://www.njstormwater.org/bmp_manual2.htm "New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual."] April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal pollution from runoff can be controlled by storm water management facilities that absorb the runoff or direct it into [[groundwater]], such as bioretention systems and infiltration basins. Retention basins tend to be less effective at reducing temperature, as the water may be heated by the sun before being discharged to a receiving stream.&lt;ref name="EPA-PDS" /&gt;{{Rp|p. 5–58|date=May 2012}}

The '''Yungas''' ([[Aymara language|Aymara]] ''yunka'' warm or temperate [[Andes]] or earth, [[Quechua language|Quechua]] ''yunka'' warm area on the slopes of the Andes)&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref Bertonio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref Laime}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a narrow band of forest along the eastern slope of the [[Andes Mountains]] from [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], and northern [[Argentina]]. It is a transitional zone between the Andean highlands and the eastern forests. Like the surrounding areas, the Yungas belong to the [[Neotropic]] [[ecozone]]; the climate is rainy, humid, and warm.

== Setting ==
The Yungas forests are extremely diverse, ranging from moist lowland forest to evergreen [[montane forest]] and [[cloud forest]]s. The terrain, formed by [[valley]]s, fluvial [[mountain trail]]s and [[stream]]s, is extremely rugged and varied, contributing to the ecological diversity and richness. A complex mosaic of habitats occur with changing latitude as well as elevation. There are high levels of [[biodiversity]] and [[Endemic (ecology)|species endemism]] throughout the Yungas regions. Many of the forests are evergreen, and the South Andean Yungas contains what may be the last evergreen forests resulting from [[Quaternary]] glaciations.

=== World Wildlife ecoregions ===
The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] has delineated three yungas [[ecoregions]] along the eastern side of the Andes:
* The northernmost is the '''[[Peruvian Yungas]]''', located entirely within [[Peru]] and stretching nearly the whole length of the country.
* The '''[[Bolivian Yungas]]''' lies to the south, mostly in Bolivia. The [[Inambari River]] marks the boundary between the Peruvian Yungas and Bolivian Yungas since the yungas north and south of the river have distinct ecological differences.
* The '''[[Southern Andean Yungas]]''' begins in southern Bolivia and continues to the north of [[Argentina]]. It is a humid forest region between the drier [[Gran Chaco]] region to the east and the dry, high altitude [[Puna grassland|Puna]] region to the west.

Yungas are transitional zones between the Andean highlands and the eastern forests. The yungas forests are extremely diverse, ranging from moist lowland forest to evergreen montane forest and cloud forests. The terrain is extremely rugged and varied, contributing to the ecological diversity and richness. A complex mosaic of habitats occur with changing latitude as well as elevation. There are high levels of biodiversity and species endemism throughout the yungas regions. Many of the forests are evergreen, and the South Andean Yungas contains what may be the last evergreen forests resulting from Quaternary glaciations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalgeographic.com/wildworld/terrestrial.html map of the ecoregions&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
The average temperature is 72°F (22&amp;nbsp;°C). The climate is varied and ranges from a humid [[Tropical climate|tropical]] to the cold of the Andes over 10,000 ft (3,000 m).

==Peruvian Yungas==
{{Main|Peruvian Yungas}}
In Peru there is a difference between Yunga and Yungas. '''Yunga''' is considered a natural region on both sides of the Peruvian Andes, the western side towards the coast is called Sea Yunga, and the eastern side into the jungle is called Fluvial Yunga, both reach a height of 2,300 m.

Instead, '''Yungas''' is the ecoregion of rain forest and montane forest from 1.000 to 3.500 m, so it is limited to the eastern side of the Andes. This concept has a closer analogy with the Bolivian Yungas. This region is considered as the most endemic biodiversity of Peru.

Forest loss in the Peruvian Yungas has sharply accelerated since the 2000s, rising seven-fold between 2005 and late 2012, according to satellite analysis by Terra-i.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Rhett: [http://news.mongabay.com/2014/0119-rhinella-yunga-toad-peru.html Red toad discovered in the upper reaches of the Amazon] Mongabay.com. Retrieved 21 Jan 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sea Yunga===
'''Sea Yunga''', or Maritime Yunga, is found between '''500 and 2,300 m''' and it is situated between the eastern part of the coastal strip and the western part of the Highlands. This subregion has a [[subtropics|subtropical]] [[desert]] climate with little rainfall along the central and southern coast (drier as you go south). The average year round day temperature is {{Convert|21|C|F}} (max 33&amp;nbsp;°C min 8&amp;nbsp;°C). A mist-fed ecosystem called [[Lomas]] is found at scattered locations among hills near the Pacific Ocean at elevations up to {{convert|1000|m|ft}}.  

The '''flora''' in the central Sea Yungas region is mainly composed by the lucuma and chirimoya trees, the [[casuarin]] and others.

Once you go north its climate becomes [[subtropics|subtropical]] in the vicinity of La Libertad, Lambayeque and Piura. Day time temperatures average between {{Convert|21|C|F}} and {{Convert|25|C|F}} depending on latitude (max 40&amp;nbsp;°C min 15&amp;nbsp;°C).

As this area approaches the tropics, fauna differs from the rest of the coast, so that animals like the [[Boidae|boa]]s, larger [[reptile]]s and the famous [[white-winged guan]] (a bird species unique to this Peruvian ecoregion) occur here. Common trees in this area are the faique, the [[zapote]], the zapayal, the ''[[Bombax barrigon|barrigon]]'' and other thorny [[tropical savanna]] trees of the [[equatorial climate|equatorial]] dry [[forest]]s on the northern coast of Piura and Tumbes.

The cooler Pacific side is more vaguely characterized. The dry and cool ''Yunga Costal'' begins at 500&amp;nbsp;m above sea level. The Maritime Yunga begins dry, and it seems to follow [[ecotone]] on ecotone until reaching the Quechua region at the Pacific side.

=== Fluvial Yunga ===

'''Fluvial Yunga''' is between the altitudes of {{convert|1000|m|ft}} and {{convert|2300|m|ft}} and is found on the eastern part of Peru. This sub-region has a [[subtropics|subtropical]] climate with ample seasonal rains. The average temperature fluctuates between 20&amp;nbsp;°C and 25&amp;nbsp;°C depending on the altitude (max 35&amp;nbsp;°C, min 11&amp;nbsp;°C).

'''Concept:'''

The concept of the east side of the continental divide is straightforward: 1,000&amp;nbsp;m above sea level it is 4.9&amp;nbsp;°C cooler, and the subtropical cloud forest (Fluvial Yunga) follows the tropical rainforest (Anti). At 2,300 m, the climate transitions from subtropical climate to temperate climate ([[Quechua (geography)|Quechua]]). The [[Tree line]] ends at 3,500 m and has an annual mean temperature of 10&amp;nbsp;°C. The region between the [[tree line]] and 4,000 m is called [[Suni (geography)|Suni]] or Jalca. Suni is a dry and cold region with many glacial valleys. Despite the harsh weather, crops such as [[quinoa]], maca, [[Kañiwa|qañiwa]], [[Vicia faba|broad beans]] and [[Ulluco|ulluku]] are cultivated here.

==== Flora and fauna ====

The '''flora''' (subtropical [[cloud forest]]) of the Yunga region is mainly composed by the [[Schinus molle|Peruvian pepper tree]], the [[Furcraea]], white [[Fique|cabuya]] (Furcraea andina), the [[Pitaya|pitahaya]] and the [[Peruvian torch cactus]] (''Echinopsis peruviana'').  The [[coca]] leaf is established in this region as well as the [[Uncaria tomentosa|uña de gato]] ("cat's claw", ''[[Uncaria tomentosa]]''). The most attractive sites of this warm refreshing region are its many [[orchid]] forests and beautiful valleys. The '''fauna''' in the Yunga region is characterized by the [[long-tailed mockingbird]], or chaucato.&lt;ref&gt;Pulgar Vidal, Javier: Geografía del Perú; Las Ocho Regiones Naturales del Perú. Edit.

===Human use===
In the early 20th century, the region was a major source for [[rubber]] and [[quinine]]. Now, [[coffee]], [[citrus]], and [[coca]] are important crops. People cultivate native plants like the [[canistel]] or eggfruit tree the [[Lúcuma|lúcuma tree]], the [[cherimoya|cherimoya or chirimoya]], the [[guava|guava or guayabo]] and the [[avocado|avocado or palta]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The [[Afro Bolivian]] community is concentrated here.

The [[Yungas Cocalera Revolution]] is based in the region. Its name derives from the one applied for the same mountain level by those who study the economic system of the prehispanic Andes.
&lt;!-- ==Conservation and threats== --&gt;

The Yungas also bear the most dangerous road in the world, called the "camino de la muerte," or [[Yungas Road|Highway of Death]].

Due to the mountainous terrain an entrepreneurial coca harvester created a network of [[zip line]]s that permit rapid travel from peak to peak by farmers, referred to locally as flying men or bird men, along with their harvests using [[Zip line trolley|zip line trollies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/2011/05/20115811409577464.html The flying men of Yungas Valley]&lt;/ref&gt;
