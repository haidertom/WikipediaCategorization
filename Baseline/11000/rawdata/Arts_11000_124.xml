'''''A Moveable Feast''''' is a [[memoir]] by American author [[Ernest Hemingway]] about his years as a struggling young migrant journalist and writer in [[Paris]] in the 1920s. The book, first published in 1964, describes the author's apprenticeship as a young writer while he was married to his first wife, [[Hadley Richardson]].

The memoir consists of various personal accounts, observations, and stories by Hemingway. He provides specific addresses of apartments, bars, cafes, and hotels — many of which can still be found in Paris today. Among other notable persons, people featured in the book include: [[Sylvia Beach]], [[Hilaire Belloc]], [[Aleister Crowley]], [[John Dos Passos]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald|F. Scott]] and [[Zelda Fitzgerald]], [[Ford Madox Ford]], [[James Joyce]], [[Wyndham Lewis]], [[Pascin]], [[Ezra Pound]], Evan Shipman, [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Alice B. Toklas]] and [[Hermann von Wedderkop]].

The memoir was published [[wikt:posthumously|posthumously]] based on Hemingway's manuscripts and notes by his fourth wife and widow, [[Mary Hemingway]], in 1964, three years after Hemingway's death. An edition altered and revised by his grandson, Seán Hemingway, was published in 2009.

==Background==
In November 1956, Hemingway recovered two small steamer trunks that he had stored in March 1928 in the basement of the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris]]. The trunks contained notebooks he had filled during the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Hotchner"/&gt; Hemingway's friend and biographer [[A. E. Hotchner]], who was with him in Paris in 1956, later recounted the occasion of Hemingway's recovery of the trunks and notebooks:&lt;ref name="Hotchner"/&gt;

{{Quote box
 |quote  = '''"''In 1956, Ernest and I were having lunch at the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|Ritz in Paris]] with [[Charles Ritz]], the hotel’s chairman, when Charley asked if Ernest was aware that a trunk of his was in the basement storage room, left there in 1930. Ernest did not remember storing the trunk but he did recall that in the 1920s [[Louis Vuitton]] had made a special trunk for him. Ernest had wondered what had become of it. Charley had the trunk brought up to his office, and after lunch Ernest opened it. It was filled with a ragtag collection of clothes, menus, receipts, memos, hunting and fishing paraphernalia, skiing equipment, racing forms, correspondence and, on the bottom, something that elicited a joyful reaction from Ernest: 'The notebooks! So that’s where they were! Enfin!' There were two stacks of lined notebooks like the ones used by schoolchildren in Paris when he lived there in the ’20s. Ernest had filled them with his careful handwriting while sitting in his favorite café, nursing a [[Café au lait|café crème]]. The notebooks described the places, the people, the events of his [[penurious]] life.''"'''

Having recovered his trunks, Hemingway had the notebooks transcribed, and then began working them up into the memoir that would eventually become ''A Moveable Feast''.&lt;ref name=HowItWas/&gt; After Hemingway's death in 1961, his widow Mary Hemingway, in her capacity as his literary executor, made final copy-edits to the manuscript prior to its publication in 1964.&lt;ref name="Hotchner"/&gt;&lt;ref name=HowItWas/&gt; In a "Note" with which she prefaced the posthumously published 1964 edition of the work, she wrote:

{{Quote box
 |quote  = '''"''Ernest started writing this book in Cuba in the autumn of 1957, worked on it in Ketchum, Idaho, in the winter of 1958-59, took it with him to Spain ... in April, 1959, and brought it back with him to Cuba and then to Ketchum late that fall. He finished the book in the spring of 1960 in Cuba.... He made some revisions ... in the fall of 1960 in Ketchum. It concerns the years 1921 to 1926 in Paris''." - M.H.'''

Gerry Brenner, a literary scholar at the [[University of Montana]], and other researchers have examined Hemingway's notes and the initial drafts of ''A Moveable Feast'', which are in the collection of Ernest Hemingway's personal papers opened to the public in 1979, following the completion of the [[John F. Kennedy Library]], where they are held in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. In a paper titled "Are We Going to Hemingway's Feast?" (1982), Brenner undertook to document Mary Hemingway's editing process and questioned its validity. He concluded that some of her changes were misguided, and others derived from questionable motives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brenner, Gerry|title=Are We Going To Hemingway's Feast?|journal=American Literature|volume= 54|number=4|date=December 1982|page= 528}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also suggested that the changes appeared to contradict Mary's stated policy for her role as executor, which had been to maintain a "hands off" approach.&lt;ref name=HowItWas&gt;{{cite book|author=Hemingway, Mary|title=How It Was|location= New York|publisher= Ballantine|date= 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brenner states that Mary changed the order of the chapters in Hemingway's final draft, apparently to "preserve chronology". This change interrupted the series of juxtaposed character sketches of such individuals as [[Sylvia Beach]], owner of the bookstore [[Shakespeare and Company (bookstore)|Shakespeare &amp; Company]], and [[Gertrude Stein]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The chapter titled "Birth of a New School", which Hemingway had dropped from his draft, was reinserted by Mary.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} Brenner alleges the most serious change was the deletion of Hemingway's lengthy apology to his first wife, [[Hadley Richardson|Hadley]]. This apology appeared in various forms in every draft of the book.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} Brenner suggests that Mary deleted it because it impugned her own role as his wife.

In contrast, Hotchner has said that he received a near final draft of ''A Moveable Feast'' in 1959, and that the version Mary Hemingway published is essentially the draft he had read then. In his view, the original 1964 publication is the version that Hemingway intended, and Mary Hemingway did not revise or add chapters on her own initiative, but simply carried out Ernest's intentions.&lt;ref name="Hotchner"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/opinion/20hotchner.html | work=The New York Times | title=Don't Touch 'A Moveable Feast' | first=A. E. | last=Hotchner | date=2009-07-19 | accessdate=2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hotchner describes Hemingway's memoir as "a serious work", that Hemingway "certainly intended it for publication", and contends: "Because Mary was busy with matters relating to Ernest’s estate, she had little involvement with the book.... What I read on the plane coming back from Cuba [in 1959] was essentially what was published. There was no extra chapter created by Mary.&lt;ref name="Hotchner"/&gt;

==Source of title==

{{Quote box
 |quote  = '''"''If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a movable feast''." - Ernest Hemingway, ''to a friend'', 1950'''

}}

The title of ''A Moveable Feast'' (a play on words for the term used for a [[moveable feast|holy day for which the date is not fixed]]) was suggested by Hemingway's friend and biographer A. E. Hotchner, who remembered Hemingway using the term in 1950.&lt;ref name=PapaHem/&gt; Hotchner's recollection of what Hemingway had said became the source of the [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] on the [[title page]] for the posthumously published work in 1964.&lt;ref name=PapaHem&gt;{{cite book|author=Hotchner, A.E.|title=Papa Hemingway|location=  New York|publisher= Random House|date= 1966|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term had also been used earlier out of its traditional religious context by [[Albert Camus]] in his novel, ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' (1942): "Masson remarked that we'd had a very early lunch, but really lunch was a movable feast, one had it when one felt like it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/ost-english-camusalbert-thestranger/CamusAlbert-TheStranger_djvu.txt|title=The Stranger|author=Camus, Albert|date=1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=The original in French does not (and cannot) contain this pun.|date=January 2017}}

==Chapters==

The 1964 edition of Hemingway's Paris memoir consists of a "Preface" by Hemingway (pg. ix), a "Note" by his widow (pg. xi), and 20 chapters, or individual parts or sections.&lt;ref name=MoveableFeast1/&gt; Each of the chapters can be read as a stand-alone piece or entity, not dependent upon the context of the whole work, nor necessarily arranged in any chronological order—with titles descriptive of the subject matter of each, as follows:&lt;ref name=MoveableFeast1&gt;Hemingway, Ernest - ''A Moveable Feast'', Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing history==

The first published edition was edited from Hemingway's manuscripts and notes by his fourth wife and widow, [[Mary Hemingway]], and published [[wikt:posthumously|posthumously]] in 1964, three years after Hemingway's death.&lt;ref name="Hotchner"/&gt;&lt;ref name=HowItWas/&gt;

In 2009 a new edition, titled the "Restored Edition", was published by [[Seán Hemingway]], assistant curator at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and grandson of Hemingway and [[Pauline Pfeiffer]]. He made numerous changes:
* The previous introductory letter by Hemingway, pieced together from various fragments by Mary Hemingway,{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} was removed.
* The chapter called "Birth of a New School" and large sections of "Ezra Pound and the Measuring Worm" and "There is Never Any End to Paris" (which has been renamed as "Winter in Schruns" and moved to chapter 16) had sections previously left out that have been re-added. The unpublished "The Pilot Fish and the Rich" has been added.
* Chapter 7 ("Shakespeare and Company") has been moved to be chapter 3, and chapter 16 ("Nada y Pues Nada") has been moved to the end of the book as an "Additional Paris Sketch".
* Hemingway's use of the second person has been restored in many places, a change which Seán asserts "brings the reader into the story".&lt;ref name="restoredp4"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hemingway, Ernest|author2=Hemingway, Seán|editor=Hemingway, Seán |title=A Moveable Feast: The Restored Edition|publisher= Scribner's|location= New York|date= 2009|page= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the new foreword by [[Patrick Hemingway]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[H]ere is the last bit of professional writing by my father, the true foreword to ''A Moveable Feast'': 'This book contains material from the ''remises'' of my memory and of my heart.  Even if the one has been tampered with and the other does not exist'."&lt;ref name="restoredpxiv"&gt;Hemingway, Seán (ed.) (2009), p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A.E. Hotchner alleged, among his other criticisms of the 2009 edition, that Seán Hemingway had edited it, in part, to exclude references to his grandmother (Hemingway's second wife Pauline Pfeiffer) that he found less than flattering.&lt;ref name="Hotchner"/&gt; As Hotchner's over-all assessment of the 2009 edition, he wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Ernest was very protective of the words he wrote, words that gave the literary world a new style of writing. Surely he has the right to have these words protected against frivolous incursion, like this reworked volume that should be called “A Moveable Book”.&lt;ref name="Hotchner"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other critics also have found fault with some of Seán Hemingway's editorial changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Massie, Allan |date=August 5, 2009 |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/5244378/life-and-letters.thtml |title=Rewrites and Wrongs |work=The Spectator |accessdate=February 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329053638/http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/5244378/life-and-letters.thtml |archive-date=March 29, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Irene Gammel writes about the new edition: "Ethically and pragmatically, restoring an author's original intent is a slippery slope when the published text has stood the test of time and when edits have been approved by authors or their legal representatives."

== Revival in wake of 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris==

In the context of the attacks, the book's French-language title, ''Paris est une fête'', was a potent symbol of defiance and celebration.

'''Art Museum of the Americas (AMA)''', located in [[Washington, D.C.]], is the first [[art museum]] in the United States primarily devoted to exhibiting works of [[modern art|modern]] and [[contemporary art]] from [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]]. The museum was formally established in 1976 by the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS). Artists represented in the AMA's permanent collection include [[Carlos Cruz-Diez]], [[Candido Portinari]], [[Pedro Figari]], [[Fernando de Szyszlo]], [[Amelia Peláez]] and [[Alejandro Obregón]].

[[File:Interior, Art Museum of the Americas - 3.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|Interior courtyard of the museum]]

The art collection of the OAS was initiated under the organization's Visual Arts Unit, beginning with the first donated artwork by the Brazilian [[Neorealism (art)|neo-realist]] artist Portinari, in 1949. In the following decade the [[Permanent Council of the Organization of American States|Permanent Council]] of the OAS determined to establish an acquisitions fund, in order to build up a permanent collection of artworks by significant contemporary artists from the member states of the OAS. A number of works were also purchased from or donated directly by artists, after the temporary exhibitions periodically held at the OAS gallery.

The Art Museum of the Americas itself was established in 1976 by OAS Permanent Council resolution, on the occasion of the [[United States Bicentennial]]. The museum opened in what was formerly the official residence of the [[Secretary General of the Organization of American States|OAS Secretary General]], a [[Spanish Colonial style|Spanish Colonial-style]] structure designed in 1912 by the architect [[Paul Cret]].

Initially the permanent collection held some 250 artworks, expanding over the next quarter-century to over 2000 items of [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[art installation|installations]], [[photography]], and [[drawing]], from the early 20th century and onwards. In addition to its permanent collection of mainly [[Caribbean art|Caribbean]] and [[Latin American art]], AM'''A''' hosts temporary and special exhibitions from across the region, and provides educational seminars and lectures from invited speakers.

The Art Museum of the Americas has also expanded its programs to include evening events, such as Art After Dark, with cutting edge music, video, performance, and installation art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturaltourismdc.org/things-do-see/calendar/event/art-after-dark-2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326060707/http://www.culturaltourismdc.org/things-do-see/calendar/event/art-after-dark-2011 |archivedate=2012-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Permanent collection==
The history of the permanent collection of the Art Museum of the Americas has roots in the former Visual Arts Unit of the Organization of American States. Under this unit, the first donation of art was received in 1949, a gift of painting by Brazilian artist Candido Portinari. In 1957 the OAS Permanent Council conferred institutional backing to the collection by establishing a modest Purchase Fund to support the acquisition of art for a collection that was to reflect the contemporary art of the member nations of the OAS to form an enduring cultural resource. Purchases made by the Visual Arts Unit were strongly linked to and influenced by the direction of its exhibition program, and a significant number of works were acquired directly from the artists on the occasion of a temporary exhibit at the OAS Gallery. In many cases, an OAS exhibition represented the artist's first individual exhibit outside of his/her country of origin.

When the museum officially opened in 1976, the collection numbered 250 works. Today, the collection has grown to close to 2000 objects in varying media including painting, sculpture, installations, prints, drawings and photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artmuseumoftheamericas.org/collection/cpg15x/thumbnails.php?album=1 |title=Museum Collection }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About AMA==
AMA | Art Museum of the Americas is the oldest museum of modern and contemporary Latin American and Caribbean art in the United States. It is part of the Organization of American States (OAS), an international public organization whose aim is to promote democracy, peace, justice, and solidarity among its 35 member countries.

AMA’s origins date back to the Visual Arts Unit of the Pan-American Union (now the OAS), and in the mid-20th century grew as one of the first catalysts of the parameters of modern art in Latin America and the Caribbean. Today the collection has more than two thousand works complementing and documenting this regional focus.

Much of the importance of this art collection is in its specialization on works that proved instrumental in the launching, particularly in the United States, of the careers of many who are now regarded as masters of mid-century Latin American and Caribbean art. The collection represents numerous significant artistic trends that have developed in Latin America, including new figuration, geometric abstraction and lyrical, conceptual art, optical and kinetic art, among other movements. 

AMA continues to organize exhibitions and programs for young and emerging artists, providing a space for cultural expression, creativity, and dialogue while highlighting issues central to its parent organization (democracy, equitable development, human rights, justice and innovation) through the arts. This mission is strengthened through cutting-edge programming emphasizing art of a high technical caliber that simultaneously furthers dialogue on current relevant social and political matters.

==AMA's Permanent Collection catalog==
[http://museum.oas.org/files/Art%20of%20the%20Americas%20-SmallRes.pdf Art of the Americas: Collection of the Art Museum of the Americas of the Organization of American States] is a rigorous and comprehensive look at the historical and cultural legacy of the AMA | Art Museum of the Americas and the OAS (Organization of American States). This book is an opportunity to present our heritage to a new generation of readers, highlighting one hundred collection pieces through new research. 

==Historical Overview==
AMA | Art Museum of the Americas is the oldest museum of Latin American and Caribbean art in the United States, serving as a branch of the Organization of American States (OAS), an international public organization whose aim is to promote democracy, peace, justice, and solidarity among its 35 member countries.

The museum was established in 1976 as the Museum of Modern Art of Latin America and has its roots in the initiatives undertaken by the OAS dating back to 1917, when it was known as Pan American Union (PAU). However, it was not until the 30s that the PAU vitalized itself as a promotional epicenter for Latin American art under the leadership of Concha Romero James, director of the Division of Intellectual Cooperation. Romero’s unit embarked on long-term projects such as creating an archive of art documents and initiating a temporary exhibitions program. 

Beginning in 1948, Cuban art critic José Gómez Sicre continued and accentuated the work of his predecessor, advancing initiatives such as: the active publication of materials on Latin American art, technical assistance to both public and private institutions and individuals interested in the field of the arts, creating a program of exhibitions of young and emerging artists of the Americas, and the establishment of a collection and museum of Latin American and Caribbean art. This work contributed to the significance of AMA as an essential institution of the study of modern and contemporary Latin American art. 

Much of the importance of this art collection is in its specialization on works that proved instrumental in the launching, particularly in the United States, of the careers of many who are now regarded as masters of mid-century Latin American and Caribbean art. The collection represents numerous significant artistic trends that have developed in Latin America, including new figuration, geometric abstraction and lyrical, conceptual art, optical and kinetic art, among other movements. 

AMA continues to organize programs and exhibitions for young and emerging artists, providing a space for cultural expression, creativity, and dialogue while highlighting issues central to its parent organization (democracy, equitable development, human rights, justice and innovation) through the arts. This mission is strengthened through cutting-edge programming emphasizing art of a high technical caliber that simultaneously furthers dialogue on current relevant social and political matters.

{{primary sources|date=December 2008}}An '''audition website''' is a web site that aggregates [[audition]] information and delivers this information via the [[World Wide Web]]. There are hundreds of companies that operate [[acting]], [[Model (person)|modeling]], and [[dancing]] audition websites. Originally, only talent agents were able to provide actors, models, dancers and other performers with audition information. This meant that only performers that were represented by Talent Agents could go on auditions. Today, both open auditions and private auditions can be found on reliable audition websites. Talented performers can browse the World Wide Web and find many different audition websites. The primary organization of professional screen and theater casting in the United States is the [[Casting Society of America]] (CSA). Membership to the CSA is optional.

Audition websites are an integral component in the employment statistics&lt;ref name="employment statistics"&gt;''Bureau Of Labor Statistics ''[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos093.htm employment statistics] Occupational Outlook Handbook - Actors, Producers, and Directors&lt;/ref&gt; of actors and other industry professionals.  Most acting assignments are typically short term and range from 1 day to a few months. Many professional actors use either agents or managers to find work, and plan their careers. A [[talent agent]] generally earns a percentage of the pay earned by an actor, as specified in the actor’s contract. Other actors rely solely on attending open [[auditions]], found on audition websites, for parts.

Some audition websites require membership and others are free to use. Most all audition websites involve the member regularly browsing audition listings and "self-submitting" for auditions. This enables members to choose the types of jobs that they audition for. Other than membership dues, audition websites do not charge other fees or take a percentage of income earned from jobs. Audition websites have grown in popularity and the most visited audition websites have memberships in the millions. A [[casting director]], [[talent agent]], [[film producer]], or [[movie director]] can use Audition websites to locate performers for casting. These industry professionals use audition websites to find talent for commercials, [[music videos]], [[movies]], and other entertainment projects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10079">'''Carl Georg August Wallin''' (2 February 1893 in Svanshall, Jonstorp, [[Skåne County]], [[Sweden]] – 28 July 1978 in Svanshall) was a Swedish [[marine art|marine painter]], [[master mariner]] and [[visual arts|visual artist]]. Most often he has painted [[marine art|mariners]] and [[coastal|coastal landscapes]].

==Biography==
'''Carl Wallin''' was born in Svanshall, a little fishing village in the western Skälderviken in [[Malmöhus County]] in northwest of [[Skåne County]], about 25 kilometers north of [[Helsingborg]], the nearest village to the south is Jonstorp. He grew up in an old seamen’s family, his father was the sea captain Jöns Andersson and his mother was Annette Wallin. His father was captain in the [[barque]] ''Netten'', which disappeared in the North Atlantic with men and everything in 1893, the same year he was born. In 1904, when he was 11 years old, his mother died too. He grew up with his grandmother. In 1925 he married Anna Greta Ingeborg Jönsson.

As soon as he had left school he went to sea. Wallin took his master mariner degree in 1914 and then he served shipping company ''Transmarin AB'' as an officer and commander. He got an interest to start painting in 1935. He was inspired by a steward on board the boat, which he commanded, and who painted landscapes as a hobby. He bought a box of colors and a piece of canvas by the meter and started painting.

In 1940 he left sea in order to devote his time to [[marine art|marine painting]]. Now he was marin painter full time. As a painter he was self-taught. His ambition was to render any ship technically correct and its movements in the sea and the rhythm of the waves. On the stretched canvas he sketched the ship and the rhythm of the waves with charcoal and chalk. Then he made a painting in brown and ochre.

Wallin’s debut was in the early 1940s, when ''Broström Lines'' announced a competition for promotional picture of the school ship ''Albatross''. He emerged as the winner in the contest in which the curator at Sjöhistoriska Museet, Gerhard Albe,&lt;ref&gt;[[:sv:Gerhard Albe]] Gerhard Albe&lt;/ref&gt; was in the jury. His breakthrough came in an exhibition in Göteborgs Handelstidning’s premises in connection with the Albatross boat launch. The orders poured in from around the country. For ''Broström AB''&lt;ref&gt;[[:sv:Broström AB]] Broström AB (''Swedish'')&lt;/ref&gt; he made many oil paintings, about 50 pieces, some of which were reproduced by the shipping company and were delivered to the agents and employees. Shipping Company ''Nordstjernan AB''&lt;ref&gt;[[:sv:Nordstjernan AB]] Nordstjernan AB (''Swedish'')&lt;/ref&gt; ordered some 30 paintings by Wallin.

Carl Wallin painted some 700 ship paintings, most of them named with the names of the ships, usually [[full-rigged ship]],&lt;ref&gt;A ''full-rigged ship'' or ''fully rigged ship'' is a sailing vessel with three or more [[Mast (sailing)|masts]], all of them [[square rigged]]. A full-rigged ship is said to have a ship ''rig''. Sometimes such a vessel will merely be called a "ship", particularly in 18th- to early-19th-century and earlier usage, to distinguish it from other vessels such as ''schooners'', ''barques'', ''barquentines'', ''brigs'', et cetera. Alternately, a full-rigged ship may be referred to by its function instead, as in ''collier'' or ''frigate'', rather than being called a ship. In many languages the word ''frigate'' or ''frigate rig'' refers to a full-rigged ship.&lt;/ref&gt; but he has also painted marine compositions and coastal landscapes. Many of the great shipping companies of that time commissioned paintings of their ships by Carl Wallin. But even foreign shipping companies, seafarers associations and federations as well as private buyers commissioned paintings.

Carl Wallin’s drawing of the ''[[Cutty Sark]]'' (the [[tea clipper]] built in Scotland),&lt;ref&gt;[[Cutty Sark (yacht)|''Cutty Sark '']] can also refer to a private yacht belong to the Duke of Westminster and used in submarine escort duties during WWII.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cutty-sark (witch)|Cutty-sark]] refers to a character created by Robert Burns in Tam o' Shanter. "Cutty sark" is 18th-century Scots for "short chemise" or "short undergarment". Hyphenated, Cutty-sark was also a nickname given to the witch Nannie Dee, a fictional character created by Robert Burns in his Tam o' Shanter, after the garment she wore. The figurehead of the [[tea clipper]] ''Cutty Sark'' is named after the character. The earliest recorded literary usage of the term cutty sark (as opposed to older usage of the two separate words) is by Dougal Graham in c. 1779 (the year of his death): "A cutty sark of guide harn sheet, My mitter he pe spin, mattam." ''Etymology'': Cutty or cuttie (the diminutive form of cuttit, from Early Middle English cutte, kutte, cute "ugly") is "short" or "stumpy". Sark or serk (from Old English serc; Old Norse serk) is a "shift", "chemise", or "shirt".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''Cutty Sark'' is a clipper ship. Built in 1869, she served as a [[merchant vessel]] (the last [[clipper]] to be built for that purpose), and then as a [[training ship]] until being put on public display in 1954. She is preserved in dry dock in [[Greenwich]], [[London]]. ''Cutty Sark'' is listed by [[National Historic Ships]] as part of the [[National Historic Fleet]] (the nautical equivalent of a [[Grade 1 Listed Building]]).&lt;/ref&gt; which since 1955, is the label on the whiskey bottles of [[Cutty Sark (whisky)|Cutty Sark]] whisky, which is a Scotch blended whisky, is probably his most famous ship painting.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cutty Sark (whisky)]] is a brand of Scotch whisky.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[clipper| clipper ship]] ''[[Cutty Sark]]'' was one of the most famous clipper ships that sailed under Brittiska Ostindiska Kompaniet ([[British East India Company]]). In 1953 he traveled for study purposes to a lot of countries, he went to Germany, England, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Algeria, Cyprus, Greece, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey and Italy.

Carl Wallin was living in Svanshall, where he also had his studio. He initiated the formation of the maritime museum in Svanshall, founded in 1959 and located in the deckhouse to the S/S Ribersborg. His customers often came to visit him and gave him order. For relaxation and recreation from his painting he liked to go saling and fishing. Many of his paintings have ended up all around the world. He was active until his final year, in 1978, when he died at age 85. Carl Georg August Wallin and his wife, Anna-Greta Ingeborg Wallin (25 October 1904 - 29 June 1984), are both buried in Jonstorp's cemetery, Farhult-Jonstorps parish in Höganäs municipality.

Carl Wallin participated in the exhibition "''Kulla-art''" in [[Höganäs]], including at the 10th anniversary celebration in 1950, and he has performed separately in [[Malmö]] and [[Höganäs]] museum in 1956, in [[Arild]] in [[Skåne County]] in 1964 and in a [[maritime museum]] in [[Stockholm]], Sjöhistoriska museet in Stockholm,&lt;ref&gt;[[:sv:Sjöhistoriska museet|Sjöhistoriska museet in Stockholm (''Swedish'')]]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1969. In 1983, after his death, a major exhibition in Höganäs museum was arranged.

The '''coat of arms of [[Gabon]]''' was designed by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[heraldist]] and [[vexillologist]] Louis Mühlemann, one of the founding members of the [[International Federation of Vexillological Associations|FIAV]] and also designer of the former [[Coat of arms of the Republic of the Congo|coat of arms of Congo]]. It has been in use since 15 July 1963.&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;{{cite book|last1=Briggs|first1=Geoffrey|title=National Heraldry of the World|date=1974|publisher=Viking Press|location=New York|isbn=9780670504527}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Description==
The supporters of the symbol are [[Leopard (heraldry)|panther]]s which symbolize the vigilance and courage of the president who protects the nation. The bezants (golden discs) in chief of the shield symbolize the mineral wealth of the country.&lt;ref name=Briggs /&gt; The ship at the lower part represents [[Gabon]] moving towards a brighter future.&lt;ref name=Briggs /&gt; According to Briggs,&lt;ref name=Briggs /&gt; "green represents the great dense forests; yellow, the sun; blue, the sea; and black, the people of Africa". The [[Aucoumea klaineana|okoumé tree]] at the top of the shield symbolizes the timber trade.&lt;ref name=Briggs /&gt; 

The coat of arms is unusual in having two ribbons with mottos in two different languages. The ribbon below the shield has a motto in French 'UNION, TRAVAIL, JUSTICE' ('Unity, Work, Justice'). The second ribbon is placed beneath the branches of the [[Aucoumea klaineana|okoumé tree]] and has a motto in Latin 'UNITI PROGREDIEMUR' ('We shall go forward united').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8612">Under [[Canadian trade-mark law]], "confusion" is where a [[Trademark|trade-mark]] is similar enough to another trade-mark to cause consumers to equate them. Likelihood of confusion plays a central role in trade-mark registration, infringement and [[Passing off; trademark registration in Canadian law|passing-off]].{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=530}} Whether a trade-mark or [[Trade name|trade-name]] is confusing is a [[question of fact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Benson &amp; Hedges (Canada) Limited v. St. Regis Tobacco Corporation|link=|year=1968|court=scc|num=1|format=canlii|pinpoint= p. 199|parallelcite=[1969] SCR 192|date=1968-11-18|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of confusion in trade-mark law is analogous to the role of [[Patent infringement in Canadian law|substantial infringement]] in [[Canadian patent law|patent law]].{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=530}}

==Definition==

Section 6 of the ''Trademarks Act'' sets out the situations where a trade-mark is confusing:

{{quote|6.(2) The use of a trade-mark causes confusion with another trade-mark if the use of both trade-marks in the same area would be likely to lead to the inference that the wares or services associated with those trade-marks are manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by the same person, whether or not the wares or service are of the same general class.&lt;ref name = "TMA62"&gt;{{cite web|title = ''Trade-marks Act'' (R.S.C., 1985, c. T-13)|url = http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/T-13/section-6.html}}, s. 6(2)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The essence of confusion is the inference of common source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Visa International Service Association v. Visa Motel Corporation|link=|year=1984|court=bcca|num=517|format=canlii|pinpoint=par. 15|parallelcite=1 CPR (3d) 109 |date=1984-06-21|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Trade-mark A will be confusing with Trade-mark B if the use of both trade-marks in the same area will lead consumers to believe that the goods or services sold under either trade-mark originate from the same source.

==Statutory Factors==

Section 6(5) of the ''Trademarks Act'' provides that in determining whether there is confusion, a court must examine "all of the surrounding circumstances" including:

{{quote|
(a) the inherent distinctiveness of the trade-marks or trade-names and the extent to which they have become known;

(b) the length of time the trade-marks or trade-names have been in use;

(c) the nature of the wares, services or business;

(d) the nature of the trade; and

(e) the degree of resemblance between the trade-marks or trade-names in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''Trade-marks Act'' (R.S.C., 1985, c. T-13)|url = http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/T-13/section-6.html}}, s. 6(5)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The factors under section 6(5) are not exhaustive.&lt;ref&gt;''Gainers Inc. v. Marchildon'' (1996), 66 C.P.R. (3d) 308 (F.C.T.D.)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, given the factual nature of confusion, the particular factors considered and the weighing of the factors varies from case-to-case.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=531}}

===Degree of Resemblance===

Determining the degree of resemblance between the trade-marks is the starting point of a confusion analysis.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=532}} The assessment of resemblance under s. 6(5)(e) is not limited to similarities in the appearance of the trade-marks. Similar sounding word marks can be confusing, even if they appear to be different.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=532}} Word marks representing similar ideas can be confusing (e.g. "Smoothies" and "Smarties" in the context of candies).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Rowntree Company Limited v. Paulin Chambers Company Limited et al.|link=|year=1967|court=scc|num=100|format=canlii|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[1968] SCR 134|date=1967-11-28|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard of Comparison===

In determining the degree of resemblance between the trade-marks, a court will examine each trade-mark as a whole, rather than breaking it up into its individual elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Ultravite Laboratories Ltd. v. Whitehall Laboratories Ltd.|link=|year=1965|court=scc|num=43|format=canlii|pinpoint=p. 192|parallelcite=[1965] SCR 734|date=1965-06-24|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''Molson Companies Ltd. v. John Labatt Ltd.'', the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] compared the trade-marks "Molson Golden" and "Winchester Gold" in their entirety.&lt;ref name = "MolsonLabatt"&gt;''Molson Companies Ltd. v. John Labatt Ltd.'' (1994), 58 C.P.R. (3d) 527&lt;/ref&gt; Although both trade-marks used the descriptive "Gold" or "Golden", when viewed as a whole, the trade-marks were sufficiently distinguishable that there was no reasonable likelihood of confusion.&lt;ref name = "MolsonLabatt"/&gt;

==="Ordinary Casual Consumer Somewhat in a Hurry"===

In a leading case on confusion, ''[[Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] stated that the appropriate standard of comparison is that of the "ordinary casual consumer somewhat in a hurry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.|link=Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.|year=2006|court=scc|num=22|format=|pinpoint=par. 56|parallelcite=[2006] 1 SCR 772|date=2006-06-02|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In applying this standard, a court will ask whether a consumer of average intelligence and caution casually encountering both trade-marks in the marketplace would be likely to confuse them.

===Actual Evidence of Confusion===

In addition to predicting whether an "ordinary casual consumer somewhat in a hurry" would perceive confusion, a court may also consider evidence of actual confusion of the trade-marks in the marketplace.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=534}} Although evidence of actual confusion is not necessary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Christian Dior, S.A. v. Dion Neckwear Ltd.|link=|year=2002|court=fca|num=29|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[2002] 3 FC 405|date=2002-01-23|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the presence or absence of actual confusion in the marketplace may be a relevant "surrounding circumstance" under s. 6(5) of the ''Trade-marks Act''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mattel'', par. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinctiveness===

Marks consisting of everyday words or expressions are inherently less distinctive than ones based on invented or coined words or expressions.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=535}} However, a mark based on an everyday word may nonetheless acquire distinctiveness if it is employed extensively.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=534}} In [[Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.|''Mattel'']], the Court found that although [[Mattel]]’s "Barbie" trade-mark was based on an [[Barbara (name)|every day word]], it had acquired substantial distinctiveness through its strong association with the company's [[Barbie doll|doll products]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mattel'', par. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade-marks in Different Businesses===

Although section 6(2) of the ''Trade-marks Act'' provides that there can be confusion "whether or not the wares or service are of the same general class",&lt;ref name = "TMA62"/&gt; differences in the types of goods or services associated with each trade-mark are a relevant consideration in determining confusion.&lt;ref&gt;''Mattel'', par. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In  [[Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.|''Mattel'']], the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] found it unlikely that consumers would confuse "Barbie" for dolls with "Barbie" for restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;''Mattel'', par. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in ''Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin v. Boutiques Cliquot Ltée'', the Supreme Court of Canada found that the use of  "Cliquot" for mid-market women’s clothing stores was not confusing with "Veuve Clicquot" as a mark for a [[Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin|famous brand of champagne]].&lt;ref name = "VeuveClicquot"&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin v. Boutiques Cliquot Ltée|link=|year=2006|court=scc|num=23|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[2006] 1 SCR 824|date=2006-06-02|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is possible for a famous trade-mark holder to argue that its trade-mark will expand into new lines of business, there must a reasonable basis for this prediction.&lt;ref name = "VeuveClicquot"/&gt;

A '''deathtrap''' is a [[literary]] and [[drama]]tic [[plot device]] in which a [[villain]] who has captured the [[hero]] or another sympathetic character attempts to use an elaborate, improbable, and usually sadistic method of [[murder]]ing them.

It is often used as a means to create dramatic tension in the story and to have the villain reveal important information to the hero, confident that the hero will shortly not be able to use it. It may also be a means to show the hero's resourcefulness in escaping, or the writer's ingenuity at devising a last-minute rescue or [[deus ex machina]].

== History ==
This plot device is generally believed to have been popularized by [[Serial film|movie serials]] and 19th-century theatrical [[melodrama]]s. A well-known example is the [[cliché]] of the moustache-twirling villain leaving the heroine tied to railroad tracks. Its use in the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] film series and [[superhero]] stories is well known.

== Narrative use ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}It is a common criticism that it is unbelievable in story plots to have villains try to kill the heroes in such elaborate ways when they could use simple methods like shooting them. Through the decades, [[comic book]] writers have responded to these complaints by devising ways in which the deathtraps have served other purposes.

For instance, one ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' story by [[Jim Shooter]] had a team of Legionnaires put into a variety of deathtraps and the villains ''wanted'' the heroes to successfully escape. This was because the real purpose of the deathtraps was to have the Legionnaires use a great deal of energy doing so, which the villains then harnessed for their own benefit. Other stories have had villains use deathtraps as a means of testing the heroes or to distract them while the villain attends to other matters. On some occasions, the deathtrap is a machine that "absorbs" the energy from the hero/heroes.

Another rationalization for a deathtrap is when a particular villain simply enjoys leaving his victims some small chance of survival, just for the sake of sport. Such "sporting" villains include [[Riddler|the Riddler]], who has an uncontrollable compulsion to create intellectual challenges for his enemies. Also included in this list is the [[Jigsaw Killer]], who places his victims in life-or-death situations to prove that they appreciate life. [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] and [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] are other villains who simply enjoy the challenge.

On occasion, the villain may employ a slow deathtrap because they enjoy their victim's suffering prior to death, either due to sadistic tendencies or a desire for painful vengeance.

In a similar vein, the villain, often a [[megalomania]]c, may feel that, as a reflection of his own imagined greatness, it would be "beneath him" to murder his enemy like any common criminal, and that his enemy's death should be the worthy spectacle that a successful deathtrap would provide. In contrast, he may feel that his enemy, having provided him with a worthy challenge in their earlier encounters, himself "deserves" such a grandiose death, or that the enmity between the two is so "epic" that it merits no less than such a conclusion.

Conversely, the protagonists' act of falling into such a trap may itself be the reason they are written off and left unattended. The villain, disappointed in such a non-threatening opponent, loses interest, and intentionally leaves some chance of escape for the protagonists to "redeem" themselves. However, the disillusioned villain tends to assume that the chance is minuscule. Despite secretly hoping that the opponent survives and proves worthy of interest, the now-bored villain is invariably shocked when that actually occurs.

If fully serious, the villain may simply be too insane to recognize the impracticality of the situation, although this characterization is rarely seen outside of deliberately parodic characters such as [[Dr. Evil]].

A more recent reason is villains do it simply because it is considered 'tradition' or 'rule' of being a supervillain to place a hero in a deathtrap and then leave them to their fate. This even goes as far as heroes, or other villains, insulting a villain for attempting to avoid using a deathtrap or staying to watch. [[Batmen of All Nations#Club of Villains|El Sombrero]] is one villain who exemplifies this reason.

When a hero's sidekick or loved one is placed in a deathtrap, its purpose is often to distract the hero, occupying time and attention while the villain pursues their evil plan. Less frequently, the villain intends to instill grief and guilt as a means of defeating a hero that cannot be defeated physically. Multiple secondary characters may be placed in deathtraps to offer the hero an agonizing choice, ostensibly forcing the hero to save one victim and leave the other(s) to die.

== Famous examples ==
*''[[The Engineer's Thumb]]'' ([[Sherlock Holmes]] story): the  engineer Victor Hatherley is trapped inside a hydraulic press which would crush him to a pulp 
**Escape method: a woman working for the villains but not sharing their criminal ruthlessness opens a side panel at the last moment, allowing Hatherley to escape
*''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'': Sealing [[Indiana Jones]] and Marion in the Well of Souls
**Escape method: Seeing a possible tunnel entrance, Jones climbed a statue and toppled it towards the wall to create an entrance to a passageway that led to the outside.
*''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'': Doctor Kananga and a minion tie James Bond and Solitare to a platform to be lowered into a shark infested pool to be eaten alive.
**Escape method: Without the villains seeing, Bond activates his watch's [[rotary saw]] function to cut through his restraints to free himself and attack Kananga.
*''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'': James Bond is shackled spreadeagled to a table and a [[circular saw]] (a [[laser]] in the [[Goldfinger (film)|film]]) is approaching to cut him in half. Unlike many deathtrap scenarios, Bond remains under constant supervision, and he does not use (or have) a device or outside help to escape.
**Escape method: Bond bluffs Goldfinger, and persuades him that his replacement "008" also knows about Goldfinger's plans and that Bond's death will immediately summon him to investigate, so Goldfinger elects to not take the chance of another spy coming on the scene to interfere, which he can avoid by holding Bond captive.
*[[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]": The unnamed character finds himself bound to a large slab, beneath a bladed pendulum that slowly lowers toward him as it swings, with the intention of slicing through his chest.
**Escape method: The character lures mice to the ropes with a piece of meat. They chew through the ropes, allowing him to escape before the pendulum can slice him open.
* In the ''Dudley Do-Right'' cartoon, villain Snidely Whiplash (a parody of the stereotypical "movie-serial" villain) tied up Nell Fenwick on a table-saw conveyor belt.  The narrator (Paul Frees) noted that, "Fortunately, the belt was in need of oiling, so the trip was a slow one."  In elapsed time, through the course of the story, this actually took several hours.
*The 1960s live action [[television program|television series]] ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' usually had two-part episodes use a bizarre deathtrap as a [[cliffhanger]].
**Example: [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] traps the Dynamic Duo without their utility belts in the bottom of an industrial smokestack and begins to gradually fill it with a deadly heavier-than-air gas.
***Escape method: The pair lock elbows and brace their backs against each other to walk up the smokestack to the top opening and slide down a support cable safely to the ground.
*''[[The Venture Brothers]]'': Doctor Venture in Escape to the House of Mummies Part 2. He described the trap he was in as "Slower than haunted house spiked walls, but not quite as slow as evil scientist spiked walls."
**Escape Method: Magic forcing the walls to stop. A secondary, previously unknown Boiling Oil trap failed when a henchman confused it for "Hot [[Voile]]", which was being warmed in a clothes dryer.
*''[[The Perils of Penelope Pitstop]]'' always involved improbable deathtraps, usually set by the [[Hooded Claw]].
*Disney's ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'': Ratigan ties up Basil and Dawson in an intricate mousetrap and tells them about his plot to kill the queen. He then leaves to see his scheme unfold, assuming that they will soon be dead.
**Escape method: Basil activates the mousetrap he and Dawson are trapped in early, catching the ball that was meant to crush them, and setting off a chain reaction that interferes with every other aspect of the trap.
*''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'': The plot of the series revolves around the Jigsaw Killer, a dying vigilante who kidnaps his victims and places them in deadly traps to test them, and give them an opportunity to repent from their former lifestyle in which they took their lives for granted, and where they were unappreciative of their life and the lives and well being of others.
*''[[The Snowman (Nesbø novel)|The Snowman]]'': Rakel, [[Harry Hole]]'s beloved, is forced to sit on a fast-melting snowman; when it had melted she would fall down and the razor-sharp wire around her neck would decapitate her.
**Escape Method: Harry arrives on the scene and extricates Rakel in nick of time, at the acceptable price of the wire cutting off one of his fingers.
*''[[Titanic (1997 film)]]'': Jack Dawson is chained in a room deep down inside the ship, where he is meant to disappear and be conveniently drowned as the ship sinks, but is rescued by his lover Rose. The entire second half of the film can also be seen as an extended deathtrap situation, where the thousands of people on board find themselves faced with a painful and absurd death, due to their having bought tickets or enlisted as crew on the glamorous ship, the epitome of technical progress and luxury, and now have to either reach the lifeboats and escape or else accept their death. The villain here, in a sense, is the ship and its careless masters.
*''[[Final Destination (franchise)|Final Destination]]'': The plot of the series revolves around several people surviving a catastrophe because one of them had a premonition of it. In doing this the survivors have cheated Death, a malevolent and unseen force that sets up deathtraps to kill off the survivors in the order in which they had originally died.


A simpler variation on the deathtrap is the '''villain speech''', also known as ''[[Monologue#Monologuing|monologuing]]''. The villain, after having captured the hero or another victim, gives a long speech taunting and sneering at his victim, pontificating on how said victim will soon die, and reminiscing over how he tried for so long to get his kill and is now about to reap the reward. Villains may also give away details of their evil plots, on the rationale that the victim will die immediately and the villain often believes their victim deserves to know. This speech, given when the villain could have just killed the victim in a matter of seconds, is invariably used to give another character time to come in and save the victim, or for the victim to escape. In ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (which used the term "monologuing"), [[Mr. Incredible]] and [[Frozone]] attacked villains in the middle of their speeches (Mr. Incredible is seen attacking [[Syndrome (The Incredibles)|Syndrome]] and Frozone is mentioned to have attacked Baron von Ruthless off-camera). In a literary sense, the villain speech is also used as a form of [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]].

Even in relatively realistic stories, villains will often take a moment to say something pithy before finishing off the victim. The antagonist would often leave the victim to die whilst they commit their evil scheme. This is echoed in the film ''[[2001 - A Space Odyssey]]'' when Hal the supercomputer, confident that Dave will soon perish outside the ship, tells him that he is about to take control of the expedition and then sees Dave off with the flat remark: "This conversation can have no meaningful purpose anymore - goodbye!". Dave manages to make his way inside and kill Hal.

== Spoofs ==
The concept of the deathtrap/monologue is featured in many [[satire]]s.

* Deathtraps were spoofed heavily in the [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] movies, including a replication of [[James Bond]]'s Shark Infested Water deathtrap. It is first introduced as "an easily escapeable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death" with Austin placed on a platform over a pool (which [[Dr. Evil]] calls "the unnecessarily slow-moving dipping mechanism"). The trap is escaped by swinging on a grapple of dental floss. As the intended sharks with laserbeams  were unavailable due to the complexities of international law regarding endangered species (much to Dr. Evil's disappointment), ill-tempered [[mutant]] seabass are used instead. As part of the spoof, [[Scott Evil]], Dr. Evil's son, insists that the deathtrap is pointless and that they could simply shoot them with a pistol, which is nearby, and yells at his father for the further incompetence of leaving them alone. Dr Evil responds that not watching the killing but assuming it went well makes perfect sense.
* In the [[sitcom]] ''[[Blackadder]]'', [[Prince Edmund (Blackadder)|Prince Edmund]] is captured by his nemesis, the Hawk, who straps him into a chair which, in sixty seconds, will mutilate him in a variety of ways. Edmund's friends, [[Baldrick]] and [[Lord Percy Percy|Percy]], manage to poison the Hawk and his followers, but while celebrating this unlikely victory, the time runs out, and Edmund suffers a terrible fate. In another episode, Lord Flashheart is confronted by a villain who begins an evil villain speech. However, rather than waiting for him to finish, Flashheart merely shoots him without warning.
* ''[[Curse of Monkey Island]]'' makes fun of this cliché. The villain [[LeChuck]], after capturing [[Guybrush Threepwood]], ''insists'' on telling him his plans before executing him. By this dialogue, interesting background story that connect the games together are given to the player. Guybrush does him the favour to listen, but after a while he is so bored that he refuses to listen any more, even if LeChuck pleads to continue.
* The famous line from ''[[Watchmen]]'' wherein the character Ozymandias takes his time and explains in detail how he will set his plan irrevocably in motion and then, in a deliberate skewering of the monologuing tendencies of supervillains, explains that "[[Nite Owl|Dan]], I'm not a [[Republic Pictures|Republic serial]] villain. I did it thirty-five minutes ago."
* In ''The Simpsons'' episode "[[You Only Move Twice]]", which generally spoofs Bond villain clichés, supervillain/great boss [[Hank Scorpio]] has "Mr. Bont" strapped to a table with a laser à la Goldfinger. Bont manages to escape, only to be tackled by Homer. Scorpio's henchmen promptly shoot Bont.
*Some incarnations of the [[Evil Overlord List]] point out the impracticality of deathtraps. Some examples include making sure the deathtrap has a VERY small estimated time of death or such lines as "Shooting is NOT too good for my enemies."
* Season 5 Episode 8 of the animated classic series ''[[The Flintstones]]'' entitled "[[List of The Flintstones episodes|Dr. Sinister]]" spoofed the James Bond series ("James Bondrock") and featured, among other deathtraps, [[Fred Flintstone|Fred]] and [[Barney Rubble|Barney]] being tied to a slab with a slowly descending pendulum with blade, a la Poe's "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]". The duo escape when Barney holds his tied hands up and the blade slices through his bonds. He then unties himself and frees Fred before the final swing slices the slab in half.

'''''Erased de Kooning Drawing''''' is an early work of US artist [[Robert Rauschenberg]]: an almost blank piece of paper in a simple gilded frame.  The work was created in 1953 by Rauschenberg [[eraser|erasing]] a drawing he obtained from Dutch artist [[Willem de Kooning]].  Rauschenberg asked his friend [[Jasper Johns]] to add a written caption to the frame, which reads: "Erased de Kooning Drawing, Robert Rauschenberg, 1953”.  It is considered a [[Neo-Dada]]ist [[conceptual art]]work, with similarities affinities to [[Added Art]], although with material removed from the original work rather than added.  It has been held by the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] since 1998, which describes the work as a "drawing [with] traces of drawing media on paper with label and gilded frame".

==Development==
The work is a development from Rauschenberg's early [[Monochrome painting|monochrome]] white paintings that he first created in summer 1951.  After creating a series of completely blank white paintings, Rauschenberg set out to discover whether an artwork could be produced entirely through erasure.  He started with erasing his own drawings, but felt that the result was not sufficiently creative, so he decided to seek a drawing from another more established artist - clearly already a work of art - that he could erase.  He approached de Kooning, an artist he admired, to ask for a drawing that he could erase to create a new work of art.  After some persuasion, de Kooning gave Rauschenberg a densely worked drawing in crayon, ink, pencil and charcoal, deliberately steering away from works that he did not like, or simple pencil drawings that would be too easy for Rauschenberg to erase.   It took Rauschenberg approximately two months to obliterate as much of de Kooning drawing as he could, using a variety of different erasers.  The plain gilded frame and inscription by Jasper Johns are important parts of the work: without them, a viewer would struggle to interpret the work.

==Existing copies==
No photographs exist of the de Kooning work before its erasure, but digital photographs made by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 2010 enhanced the remaining traces of the underlying drawing, although some may have been erased by de Kooning as part of the initial creation of the work before he gave it to Rauschenberg. De Kooning's original drawing appears to be studio sketch, with several figures facing in different directions, including at least one female, probably made with pencil and charcoal.

==Exhibitions==
The work, including its frame, measures {{convert|25.25|*|21.75|*|0.5|in|cm}}. It was not exhibited in public until 1963, but Rauschenberg would show it to visitors to his studio, and it became well known.  Some considered the destruction of a de Kooning drawing to be an act of vandalism; others recognised the concept of Rauschenberg's new work.  It was bought by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1998 using a gift from [[Phyllis Wattis]].

'''''Festivals''''' is a 1973 anthology of [[festival]]-related [[folklore]] from around the world that have been compiled by [[Ruth Manning-Sanders]]. According to the book's [[dust jacket]], "This potpourri of festivals reveals fascinating customs and celebrations from many countries of the world. Each special day is preceded by background material on the origins of the holiday."

Some of the special days covered are (using Manning-Sanders' words and spellings): [[New Year's Day]], [[Brigid of Kildare|Saint Bride's Day]], the [[Sapporo Snow Festival|Japanese Snow Festival]], [[Valentine's Day|Saint Valentine's Day]], [[Saint Patrick's Day]], [[Shrove Tuesday]], [[Mardi Gras]], [[Easter|Easter Day]], [[April Fools' Day|All Fools' Day]], the [[Qingming Festival|Bright Weather Festival]], [[St George's Day|Saint George's Day]], [[May Day]], the [['Obby 'Oss festival|Padstow Hobby Horse]], [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], [[Michaelmas|Michaelmas Day]], [[Saint Crispin's Day]], [[Halloween|Hallow E'en]], the [[Guy Fawkes Night|Fifth of November]], [[Hogmanay]], and [[Christmas]].

For many of the festivals, the book includes the writings of some famous authors or historical personalities. Among those included in the book are [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]], [[William Sharp (writer)|Fiona Macleod]], [[Marco Polo]], [[John Donne]], [[Charles James Lyall|Sir Charles Lyall]], [[Norman Hunter (author)|Norman Hunter]], [[Chiang Yee]], [[Flora Thompson]], [[Laurie Lee]], [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]], [[Dylan Thomas]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Richard Cobbold]], [[P. L. Travers]], [[Oliver Herford]], [[Alison Uttley]], [[Richard Crashaw]], Jon and [[Rumer Godden]], and [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]].

Editor Manning-Sanders, a [[poet]] and [[author]] who was perhaps best known for her series of [[children's books]] in which she collected and retold [[fairy tales]], contributes four pieces to this book:

* ''Not 'Zactly''
* ''The Padstow Hobby Horse''
* ''The Ghost Ship'' (an excerpt from her novel ''Mystery at Penmarth'')

'''''Forest and Dove''''' (1927) is a painting by the [[Germany|German]] [[Surrealism|surrealist]] [[Max Ernst]]. It depicts a nocturnal scene of a forest of bizarre, abstract trees. In the thick of the forest is a childlike depiction of a dove.

Both the forest and dove themes have appeared several times in Ernst’s works. According to an analysis by the [[Tate Gallery]] in [[London]] the forest image represents the forest near Ernst’s childhood home which inspired a sense of ‘enchantment and terror’ in the artist. The same analysis also states that the dove represents Ernst himself.

The painting has a heavily textured and three-dimensional appearance. This is owed to a technique called [[grattage]]. Grattage was invented by Ernst and the [[Spain|Spanish]] surrealist [[Joan Miró]]. This technique involves scraping the paint across the canvas so that the paint takes on the imprints of objects placed beneath the canvas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3691">A '''form''' is a [[document]] with spaces (also named ''fields'' or ''placeholders'') in which to [[writing|write]] or select, for a  series of documents with similar contents. The documents usually have the printed parts in common, except, possibly, for a [[serial number]]. 

Forms, when completed, may be a statement, a request, an [[order (business)|order]], etc.; a [[check (finance)|check]] may be a form. Also there are forms for taxes; filling one in is a duty to have determined how much tax one owes, and/or the form is a request for a refund. See also [[Tax form|Tax return]].

Forms may be filled out in duplicate (or ''triplicate'', meaning three times) when the information gathered on the form needs to be distributed to several departments within an [[organization]]. This can be done using [[carbon paper]].

[[File:Mantelbögen.JPG|thumb|A variety of forms.]]

== History ==
Forms have existed for a significant amount of time, with historians of [[law]] having discovered preprinted legal forms from the early 19th century that greatly simplified the task of drafting [[complaint]]s and various other legal pleadings. It is believed that the form was conceived by mathematician and inventor [[Charles Babbage]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e24VAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA114,M1 ''On the economy of machinery and manufactures'' p114]&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions, like [[California]], many common types of legal pleadings must be submitted on official government forms.

== Advantages ==
Advantages of forms include the following:
* One has to write less (while the printing is almost universally done in some automatic way)
* One is told or reminded what information has to be supplied
* There is [[Wiktionary:uniformity|uniformity]], for convenience in processing
* Information is collected in writing and so can be reexamined later (the form can also include a signature field to allow someone to take responsibility for the accuracy of the information provided). 
* Simpler tasks, such as collecting or distributing data, can be separated in the [[workflow]] from more skilled processes, such as making decisions. Issuing and processing the forms may then be done by less skilled staff, or by a computer. The de-skilled task becomes issuing or completing the appropriate form for the circumstances, and then passing it on to the next step in the [[workflow]]. This might reduce costs and increase the volume of work that can be handled.

A form on a computer allows for conveniently typing in the variable parts (the input data).

== Form structure ==
A blank form is like a usual document, with some outlined parts with spaces. Blank forms are generally not copyrightable in the US.&lt;ref&gt;37 Code of Federal Regulations § 202.1(c) (2006) ("Blank forms, such as time cards, graph paper, account books, diaries, bank checks, scorecards, address books, report forms, order forms and the like, which are designed for recording information and do not in themselves convey information [are not subject to copyright]"); ''see also [[Baker v. Selden]]'', 101 U.S. 99 (1880).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frame and fixed content===
Part of the document that never changes. Usually a frame with title and textual instructions.

===Placeholders===
Boxes or spaces where the user can type to fill in the form.

==Notes==
&lt;references/&gt;

'''''The Life of Gargantua and of Pantagruel''''' ({{lang-fr|La vie de Gargantua et de Pantagruel}}) is a [[pentalogy]] of novels written in the 16th century by [[François Rabelais]], which tells of the adventures of two [[giant (mythology)|giants]], Gargantua ({{IPAc-en|g|ɑːr|ˈ|g|æ|n|tj|u|ə}}; {{IPA-fr|ɡaʁɡɑ̃tya|lang}}) and his son Pantagruel ({{IPAc-en|p|æ|n|ˈ|t|æ|g|r|u|ɛ|l|,_|-|əl|,_|ˌ|p|æ|n|t|ə|ˈ|g|r|uː|əl}}; {{IPA-fr|pɑ̃taɡʁyɛl|lang}}). The text is written in an amusing, extravagant, and [[satire|satirical]] vein, and features much crudity, [[scatological humor]], and violence (lists of explicit or vulgar insults fill several chapters).

The censors of the [[Collège de la Sorbonne]] stigmatized it as obscene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | publication-place = Chicago, USA | title = Rabelais | publication-date = 1952 | first1 = François | last1 = Rabelais | series = Great Books of the Western World | volume = 24 | others = Robert Maynard Hutchins (editor-in-chief), Mortimer J. Adler (associate editor), Sir Thomas Urquhart (translator), Peter Motteux (translator) | chapter = Biographical Note }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a social climate of increasing [[religious oppression]] in a lead up to the [[French Wars of Religion]], it was treated with suspicion, and contemporaries avoided mentioning it.&lt;ref name="LeCadet09"&gt;Le Cadet, Nicolas (2009) ''[http://crm.revues.org/index11852.html Marcel De Grève, La réception de Rabelais en Europe du XVIe au XVIIIe siècle]'', Cahiers de recherches médiévales et humanistes, Comptes rendus (par année de publication des ouvrages), 2009, [En ligne], mis en ligne le 20 avril 2010. Consulté le 22 novembre 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rabelais, the philosophy of his giant Pantagruel, "Pantagruelism", is rooted in "a certain gaiety of mind pickled in the scorn of fortuitous things" (French: ''une certaine gaîté d'esprit confite dans le mépris des choses fortuites'').

Rabelais had studied [[Ancient Greek]] and he applied it in inventing hundreds of new words in the text, some of which became part of the French language.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, Mikhail. ''Rabelais and his World''. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1984. p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Wordplay and risqué humor abound in his writing.

==Initial publication==
Although different editions divide the work into a varying number of tomes, the original book is a single novel consisting of five volumes.

{{Wikisource|Pantagruel|''Pantagruel''}}
The full [[modern English]] title for the work commonly known as '''''Pantagruel''''' is '''''The Horrible and Terrifying Deeds and Words of the Very Renowned Pantagruel King of the Dipsodes, Son of the Great Giant Gargantua''''' and in French, ''Les horribles et épouvantables faits et prouesses du très renommé Pantagruel Roi des Dipsodes, fils du Grand Géant Gargantua''. The original title of the work was ''Pantagruel roy des dipsodes restitué à son naturel avec ses faictz et prouesses espoventables''.&lt;ref name=Boulenger1033&gt;{{cite book | last = Rabelais | first = François | authorlink = François Rabelais |author2=Jacques Boulenger | title = Rabelais Oeuvres Complètes | publisher = Gallimard | year = 1955 | location = France | pages = 1033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most modern editions of Rabelais's work place Pantagruel as the second volume of a series, it was actually published first, around 1532 under the [[pen name]] "Alcofribas Nasier",&lt;ref name=Boulenger1033 /&gt; an [[anagram]] of ''François Rabelais''.

''Pantagruel'' was a sequel to an anonymous book entitled ''The Great Chronicles of the Great and Enormous Giant Gargantua'' (in French, ''Les Grandes Chroniques du Grand et Enorme Géant Gargantua''). This early ''Gargantua'' text enjoyed great popularity, despite its rather poor construction. Rabelais's giants are not described as being of any fixed height, as in the first two books of ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', but vary in size from chapter to chapter. For example, in one chapter Pantagruel is able to fit into a courtroom to argue a case, but in another the narrator resides inside Pantagruel's mouth for 6 months and discovers an entire nation living around his teeth.

At the beginning of this book, Gargantua's wife dies giving birth to Pantagruel, who grows to be as giant and scholarly as his father. Rabelais gives a catalog of his reading, mostly humorously-titled books, and judgements in nonsensical legal cases. "The lion's share of ''Pantagruel''{{'}}s seventh chapter consists of a concluding catalog attributed to the Abbey of Saint-Victor," states Bodemer in his essay, "Rabelais and the Abbey of Saint-Victor Revisited".&lt;ref&gt;Brett Bodemer. "Rabelais and the Abbey of Saint-Victor Revisited." ''Information &amp; Culture: A Journal of History'' 47.1 (2012): 4–17&lt;/ref&gt;

He befriends hard-partying jokester [[Panurge]]. Together with a group of friends, they intoxicate an army of invading giants, burn their camp, and drown survivors in urine. Epistemon, decapitated in the fray, recovers when Panurge sews his head back to his body. He reports that souls in hell are poorly paid and work bad jobs, but that's the extent of their torments. Another battle is missed by the narrator, who is exploring the civilization in Pantagruel's mouth at the time.

[[File:Gustave Doré - Gargantua.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Gargantua]] and "Pilgrims eaten in salads'', illustration [[Gustave Doré]], 1873.]]
After the success of ''Pantagruel'', Rabelais revisited and revised his source material. He produced an improved narrative of the life and acts of Pantagruel's father in '''''The Very Horrific Life of Great Gargantua, Father of Pantagruel''''' (in French, ''La vie très horrifique du grand Gargantua, père de Pantagruel''), commonly known as '''''Gargantua'''''. This volume begins with the miraculous birth of Gargantua after an 11-month pregnancy.

The labor is so difficult, his mother threatens to castrate his father, Lord [[Grandgousier]]. The giant Gargantua emerges at his mother's left ear, calling for ale, while 17,913 cows were required for the provision of his daily milk. His first garment featured a codpiece whose "exiture, outjecting or outstanding ... was of the length of a yard",&lt;ref&gt;Gargantua and Pantagruel, Rabelais, Urquhart translation, Chapters 1.VII and VIII&lt;/ref&gt; its contents providing so much delight that his three nurses squabble over claims to it.&lt;ref&gt;Urquhart, Chapter 1.XI&lt;/ref&gt; After some indifferent education at home, he is sent to Paris where the crowds so annoy him that he drowns thousands of them in a flood of urine (the survivors laugh so much, the city is renamed "Par Ris").

He steals the bells of St. Anthony, but gives them back after a sophist makes ludicrously self-centered appeals for their return. While he studies diligently in Paris, the neighboring Lord [[Picrochole]]'s bakers are insulted and attacked by Grandgousier's shepherds. A massive retaliatory strike against Grandgousier's lands is finally halted at Seville by the merciless Friar John. Grandgousier sues for peace, but Picrochole arrogantly rebuffs him. Gargantua and Friar John rally the troops and (after Gargantua nearly swallows 6 pilgrims who accidentally fell in his salad) they win a great battle, drive Picrochole back to his city, then overthrow it. As a reward he gives Le Coudray to Gymnaste, Montpensier to Eudemon, Le Rivau to Tolmere, [[Château de Montsoreau|Montsoreau]] to Ithybole, and [[Candes-Saint-Martin|Candes]] to Acamas.

Also as a reward, Friar John is given funds to establish the "anti-church" [[Abbey of Thélème]], which has become one of the most notable parables in Western philosophy. It can be considered a point-by-point critique of the educational practices of the age, or a call for free schooling, or a defense of all sorts of notions on human nature.

===''The Third Book''===
{{Wikisource|The Third Book|''The Third Book''}}
Rabelais then returned to the story of Pantagruel himself in the last three books. In '''''The Third Book of Pantagruel''''' (in French, ''Le tiers-livre de Pantagruel''; the original title is ''Le tiers livre des faicts et dicts héroïques du bon Pantagruel''&lt;ref name=Boulenger1033 /&gt;), the narrative style changes to a parody of the philosophical dialogue, where the earthy [[Panurge]] gets the last word. He sermonizes against moral restraint and in favor of indebtedness, yet accepts Pantagruel's offer to repay all of his creditors.

Now financially solvent for the first time, Panurge stops wearing his long codpiece and seeks advice about whom to marry. Various auguries (opening Virgil to a random page, inducing prophetic dream through half-hearted fasting) and councillors – the Sibyl of Panzoust, the mute Goatnose, the old poet Raminagrobis, Friar John, a group of learned doctors and lawyers, and a fool – all agree that if he marries, his wife will cheat on him, beat him, and rob him. But he egregiously reinterprets their prophecies in a more favorable light.

In a brief interlude, Pantagruel defends Judge Brindlegoose, who has pronounced sentence by rolling dice for 40 years, on the grounds that he is an old idiot and therefore favored by Fortune. As a last attempt to settle the question of marriage, Pantagruel and Panurge take a sea voyage to consult the Oracle of Bacbuc ("Divine Bottle"). Their ship is well-provisioned with the phallic herb Pantagruelion, for which Rabelais gives a ribald natural history.

===''The Fourth Book''===
{{Wikisource|The Fourth Book|''The Fourth Book''}}
[[File:Dingdong and Panurge.jpg|thumb|left|Dingdong and Panurge]]

The sea voyage continues for the whole of '''''The Fourth Book of Pantagruel''''' (in French, ''Le quart-livre de Pantagruel''; the original title is ''Le quart livre des faicts et dicts héroïques du bon Pantagruel''&lt;ref name=Boulenger1033 /&gt;). The whole book can be seen as a comical retelling of the [[Odyssey]], or of the story of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]]. In ''The Fourth Book'', perhaps his most satirical, Rabelais criticizes the arrogance and wealth of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the political figures of the time, and popular superstitions, and he addresses several religious, political, linguistic, and philosophical issues.

The group sails to East Asia and buys many exotic animals. Panurge quarrels with the sheep merchant Dingdong, and takes his revenge by drowning him and his flock. They pass by the islands of the Bailiffs, whose peasants charge to be beaten. During a terrible storm at sea, Panurge is paralyzed with fear but feigns insufferable bravura afterwards. After slaying a sea-monster and being informed of the death of the giant Lent, they arrive at Wild Island, where the half-sausage inhabitants (called [[Chitterlings]]) mistake Pantagruel for their enemy Lent and attack.

The battle is stopped by a divine winged pig, who excretes mustard on the battlefield. They proceed to Ruach, whose people eat air, to barren Pope-Figland where a farmer and his wife outwit the devil, and to the arrogantly Catholic Papimania, where the people worship the Pope and his [[Decretal]]s. After sailing through a cloud of frozen words and sounds, they come to an island that worships Gaster, the god of food. The book ends when Pantagruel fires a salute at the island of the Muses, and Panurge befouls himself for fear of the sound, and of the "celebrated cat Rodilardus".

===''The Fifth Book''===
{{Wikisource|The Fifth Book|''The Fifth Book''}}
'''''The Fifth Book of Pantagruel''''' (in French, ''Le cinquième-livre de Pantagruel''; the original title is ''Le cinquiesme et dernier livre des faicts et dicts héroïques du bon Pantagruel''&lt;ref name=Boulenger1033 /&gt;) was published posthumously around 1564, and chronicles the further journeyings of Pantagruel and his friends. At Ringing Island, the company find birds living in the same hierarchy as the Catholic Church.

On Tool Island, the people are so fat they slit their skin to allow the fat to puff out. At the next island they are imprisoned by Furred Law-Cats, and escape only by answering a riddle. Nearby, they find an island of lawyers who nourish themselves on protracted court cases. In the Queendom of Whims, they uncomprehendingly watch a living-figure chess match with the miracle-working and prolix Queen Quintessence.

Passing by the abbey of the sexually prolific Semiquavers, and the Elephants and monstrous Hearsay of Satin Island, they come to the realms of darkness. Led by a guide from Lanternland, they go deep below the earth to the oracle of Bacbuc. After much admiring of the architecture and many religious ceremonies, they come to the sacred bottle itself. It utters the one word "trinc". After drinking liquid text from a book of interpretation, Panurge concludes wine inspires him to right action, and he forthwith vows to marry as quickly and as often as possible.

The last volume's attribution to Rabelais is debatable. The Fifth Book was not published until nine years after his death and includes much material that is clearly borrowed (such as from [[Lucian]]'s ''[[True History]]'' and [[Francesco Colonna]]'s ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]''&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Francon, "Francesco Colonna's 'Poliphili Hypnerotomachia' and Rabelais", ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 50, No. 1 (January 1955), pp. 52–55&lt;/ref&gt;) or of lesser quality than the previous books. In the notes to his translation of ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'', [[Donald M. Frame]] proposes that the Fifth Book may have been formed from unfinished material that a publisher later patched together. This interpretation has been largely supported by Mireille Huchon in "Rabelais Grammairien",&lt;ref&gt;"Rabelais grammairien. De l'histoire du texte aux problèmes d'authenticité", Mirelle Huchon, in Etudes Rabelaisiennes XVI, Geneva, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; the first book to provide a rigorous grammatical analysis of the matter.

J. M. Cohen, in his Introduction to the [[Penguin Classics]] edition, states that chapters 17–48 were written by another hand using notes left by Rabelais and the general drift of what Rabelais had written of the Fifth Book.

==Analysis==
===Bakhtin's analysis of Rabelais===
&lt;div class="thumb tright"&gt;

{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"

&lt;div class="thumbcaption"&gt;An example of the giants' shift in body size, above where people are the size of Pantagruel's foot, and below where Gargantua is hardly twice the height of a human.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
[[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s book ''[[Rabelais and His World]]'' explores Gargantua and Pantagruel and is considered a classic of Renaissance studies.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; Bakhtin declares that for centuries Rabelais' book had been misunderstood. Throughout ''Rabelais and His World'', Bakhtin attempts two things. First, to recover sections of Gargantua and Pantagruel that in the past were either ignored or suppressed. Secondly, to conduct an analysis of the Renaissance [[Social structure|social system]] in order to discover the balance between language that was permitted and language which was not.&lt;ref name="Clark and Holquist, pp. 297–299"&gt;Clark and Holquist, pp. 297–299&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this analysis, Bakhtin pinpoints two important subtexts in Rabelais' work: the first is [[carnivalesque]] which Bakhtin describes as a social institution, and the second is [[grotesque body|grotesque realism]], which is defined as a literary mode. Thus, in ''Rabelais and His World'', Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body.&lt;ref name="Clark and Holquist, pp. 297–299"/&gt;

Bakhtin explains that ''carnival'' in Rabelais' work and age is associated with the collectivity, for those attending a [[carnival]] do not merely constitute a crowd. Rather the people are seen as a whole, organized in a way that defies socioeconomic and political organization.&lt;ref name=CH302&gt;Clark and Holquist, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bakhtin, "[A]ll were considered equal during carnival. Here, in the town square, a special form of free and familiar contact reigned among people who were usually divided by the barriers of caste, property, profession, and age".&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

At carnival time, the unique [[sense of time]] and space causes the individual to feel he is a part of the collectivity, at which point he ceases to be himself. It is at this point that, through costume and mask, an individual exchanges bodies and is renewed. At the same time there arises a heightened awareness of one's sensual, material, bodily unity and community.&lt;ref name=CH302 /&gt;

Bakhtin says also that in Rabelais the notion of carnival is connected with that of the grotesque. The collectivity partaking in the carnival is aware of its unity in time as well as its historic immortality associated with its continual death and renewal. According to Bakhtin, the body is in need of a type of clock if it is to be aware of its timelessness. The grotesque is the term used by Bakhtin to describe the emphasis of bodily changes through eating, evacuation, and sex: it is used as a [[Measuring instrument|measuring device]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==
[[Thomas Urquhart]] first translated the work into English in the mid-17th century, although his translation was incomplete, and [[Peter Anthony Motteux]] completed the translation of the fourth and fifth books. The Urquhart/Motteux version is far from literal, but Urquhart's work was described by [[J. M. Cohen]] in the preface to his 1955 translation as "more like a brilliant recasting and expansion than a translation", although Motteux's contribution was criticised as "no better than competent hackwork... [W]here Urquhart often enriches, he invariably impoverishes". The Urquhart/Motteaux translation is out of copyright, and so it has been used for many reprinted editions, including that of Britannica's ''[[Great Books of the Western World]]''.

William Francis Smith (1842–1919) made a new translation in 1893, trying to match Rabelais' sentence forms exactly, which renders the English obscure in places. For example, the convent prior exclaims against Friar John when the latter bursts into the chapel,

&lt;blockquote&gt;What will this drunken Fellow do here? Let one take me him to prison. Thus to disturb divine Service!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Smith's version includes copious notes. 

Also well annotated is an abridged but vivid translation of 1946 by Samuel Putnam, which appears in a Viking Portable edition that was still in print as late as 1968. Putnam omitted sections he believed of lesser interest to modern readers, including the entirety of the fifth book.  The annotations occur every few pages, explain obscure references, and fill the reader in as to  original content by him excised.  

John Michael Cohen's modern translation, first published in 1955 by Penguin, "admirably preserves the frankness and vitality of the original", according to its back cover, although it provides limited explanation of Rabelais' word-plays and allusions.

Penguin published a translation by [[M. A. Screech]] in 2006 with an explanatory section preceding each chapter and brief footnotes explaining some of the allusions and puns used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Rabelais |first= François |title=Gargantua and Pantagruel |others= Translated by M.

[[File:Kaleyard Gate 1.jpg|thumb|[[Chester city walls]] showing Kaleyard Gate]]
'''Kaleyard Gate''' is a [[postern]] gate in [[Chester city walls]], [[Cheshire]], England ({{gbmapping|SJ406665}}).  It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376161|desc= Kaleyard Gate, Chester|access-date= 15 July 2012 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th&amp;nbsp;century the monks of [[Chester Cathedral|St Werburgh's Abbey]] had developed a vegetable garden (known as the kaleyard) outside the city walls.  Access to it was by a devious walk through [[Eastgate and Eastgate Clock|Eastgate]] and they wanted to have an easier route.  They petitioned [[Edward I of England|Edward&amp;nbsp;I]] in 1275 to allow them to cut a gate through the wall to provide direct access to the garden.  This he allowed under certain conditions, one of which was that it must be locked at nightfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last =Ward | first =Simon | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Chester: A History |edition= | publisher =Phillimore | year = 2009 | location =Chichester | page = 40|  isbn =978-1-86077-499-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gate consists of a simple opening in the sandstone wall containing a door.

{{Culture of Korea}}
'''Korean painting''' includes paintings made in Korea or by overseas Koreans on all surfaces. It includes art as old as the petroglyphs through post-modern conceptual art using transient forms of light. [[Calligraphy]] rarely occurs in oil paintings and is dealt with in the brushwork entry, [[Korean calligraphy]]. Like arts of East Asia, beauty of space is important for Korean painting.
[[File:약산 강이오 초상.jpg|right|thumb|180px|"Portrait of Kang Io" by [[Yi Jaegwan]] (1783–1837).]]

== Introduction ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Generally the history of Korean painting is dated to approximately 108 AD, when it first appears as an independent form. Between that time and the paintings and [[fresco]]es that appear on the [[Goguryeo]] tombs, there has been little research. Until the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] dynasty the primary influence was [[Chinese painting]] though done with Korean landscapes, facial features, Buddhist topics, and an emphasis on celestial observation in keeping with the rapid development of Korean astronomy.

Throughout the history of Korean painting, there has been a constant separation of monochromatic works of black brushwork on very often [[mulberry paper]] or silk; and the colourful folk art or ''[[minhwa]]'', ritual arts, tomb paintings, and festival arts which had extensive use of colour.

This distinction was often class-based: scholars, particularly in [[Confucian art]] felt that one could see colour in monochromatic paintings within the gradations and felt that the actual use of colour coarsened the paintings, and restricted the imagination. Korean folk art, and painting of architectural frames was seen as brightening certain outside wood frames, and again within the tradition of Chinese architecture, and the early Buddhist influences of profuse rich thalo and primary colours inspired by [[Indian art]].

Korean painters in the post-1945 period have assimilated some of the approaches of the west. Certain European artists with thick [[impasto]] technique and foregrounded brushstrokes captured the Korean interest first. Such artists as [[Gauguin]], [[Adolphe Joseph Thomas Monticelli|Monticelli]], [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]], and [[Braque]] have been highly influential as they have been the most taught in art schools, with books both readily available and translated into Korean early. And from these have been drawn the tonal palettes of modern Korean artists: yellow ochre, cadmium yellow, Naples yellow, red earth, and sienna. All thickly painted, roughly stroked, and often showing heavily textured canvases or thick pebbled handmade papers.

Colour theory has been used over formal perspective, and there has yet to be an overlap between painterly art and pop-graphics, since the primary influence on painters is ceramics art.

== Genre subjects ==

[[File:나한도(羅漢圖).jpg|260px|right|thumb|[[Arahat]], Joseon buddhist painting in the 16th century Korea.]]
The expected genres of [[Buddhist art]] showing the Buddha, or Buddhist monks, and [[Confucian art]] of scholars in repose, or studying in quiet often mountainous surroundings follows general East Asian art trends. Nimbus colours are not necessarily gold, and may be suggested by lighter colours. Faces tend to realism and show humanity and age. Drapery is done with some to great care. The face is generally two-dimensional, the drapery three-dimensional. As in medieval and renaissance western art, drapery and faces are done often by two or three artists who specialize in one particular painterly skill. Iconography follows [[Buddhist iconography]].

Scholars tend to have the traditional stove-pipe hats, or other rank hats, and scholar's monochromatic robes. Typically they are at rest in teahouses near mountains or at mountain lodges, or will be pictured with their teachers or mentors.

Hunting scenes, familiar throughout the entire world, are often seen in Korean courtly art, and are reminiscent of Mongolian and Persian hunting scenes. Wild boar, deer, and stags, and Siberian tigers as well were hunted. Particularly lethal spears and spear-handled maces were used by horsemen within hunting grounds after archers on the ground led the initial provocation of the animals as beaters.
Buddhas tend to have Korean facial features, and are in easy resting positions.

* ''Tiger:'' The tiger was among the most popular motifs in Korea folk painting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Likely originating from the mythical "White tiger" guardian spirit of the east, a notable characteristic about the tiger as featured in Korea folk traditions is how it is seldom portrayed as a ferocious beast but as a friendly and sometimes even funny and stupid animal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* ''The mountain spirit and dragon king:'' The popular mountain spirit and dragon king motifs have their origins in two famous figures in Korean history, Dangun and Munmu.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dangun is the legendary progenitor of the Korean people who is said to have turned into a mountain spirit. The dragon king is usually depicted as a mighty animal flying amidst the clouds over a sea of high waves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Buddhist Paintings ===
Buddhist temples and hermitages across the country are rich archives of folk paintings, ranging from large icon images for ritual use to illustrations for sutras and anecdotes about famous monks and their portraits. These temple painting are noted for simple compositions and bright colors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guide to Korean Culture|last=Korean Culture and Information Service Mynistry of Culture|publisher=Hollym International Corp.|year=2010|location=13-13 Gwancheol-dong, Jongno-gu, Seul 110–111 Korea|pages=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Confucian Paintings ===
Folk paintings in this category included character designs of the popular themes of loyalty and filial piety, pictures depicting the life stories of renowned scholars and depictions of a carp jumping up from the river to transform into a dragon symbolizing the aspiration for distinguished academic achievement and a successful career in officialdom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Decorative Painting ===
The vast majority of ancient folk painting were used for decorative purposes. These paintings generally repeat popular motifs with relatively poor techniques, but attest to the nation's religious tradition harmonizing various faiths such as shamanism, Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Goguryeo painters ==

[[Goguryeo art]], preserved largely in tomb paintings, is noted for the vigour of its imagery. Finely detailed art can be seen in Goguryeo tombs and other murals. Many of the art pieces has an original style of painting.

[[Complex of Goguryeo Tombs|Goguryeo tomb murals]] date from around AD 500 during the Goguryeo period, 37 BC-AD 668. These magnificent, still strongly colored murals show daily life and Korean mythologies of the time. By 2005, 70 murals had been found, mostly in the [[Taedong river]] basin near [[Pyongyang]], the Anak area in [[South Hwanghae Province]].

== Goryeo Dynasty ==
[[File:Ksitigarbha (Metropolitan Museum of Art).jpg|160px|thumb|right|[[Ksitigarbha]], Goryeo Dynasty (918–1392); 1st half of 14c.]]
{{Main article|List of Goryeo Buddhist paintings}}
During the Goryeo dynasty exceptionally beautiful paintings were produced in the service of Buddhism; paintings of the [[bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara]] (Korean: Gwaneum Bosal) are especially noted for their elegance and spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.asianart.com/exhibitions/korea/intro.html|title=Goryeo Dynasty: Korea's Age of Enlightenment|author=[[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patronage of the Goryeo's leading families resulted in the production of the high quality Buddhist paintings like refined and detailed paintings of Buddhist saints or monks.

[[Yi Nyeong]], a court painter, and [[Yi Je-hyeon]], a scholar-painter, are considered significant Goryeo artists outside of the Buddhist tradition.

== Joseon Dynasty ==

[[File:서문보 산수도(山水圖) 15세기.jpg|left|290px|thumb|Early Joseon landscape painting by Seo Munbo in the late 15th century.]]
The influence of Confucianism superseded that of Buddhism in this period, however Buddhist elements remained and it is not true that Buddhist art declined, it continued, and was encouraged but not by the royal centres of art, or the accepted taste of the Joseon Dynasty publicly; however in private homes, and indeed in the summer palaces of the Joseon Dynasty kings, the simplicity of Buddhist art was given great appreciation – but it was not seen as citified art.

During the transitional period leading into the Joseon dynasty some Korean buddhist painters left for Japan. [[Yi Su-mun]] (1400?–1450?) who is considered the founder of [[Soga school]] of Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=143828|title=Term details|author=[[The British Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a boat-companion of the older priest-painter, [[Tenshō Shūbun|Shubun of Shokokuji]] when he returned from Korea to Japan in 1424. Japanese tradition declared that Yi was so skilled after his "Catfish and Gourd" painting that Shogun [[Yoshimochi]] claimed him to be a son of the legendary [[Josetsu]], as an adoptive honorific. Yi painted alongside and influenced the originals of Japanese [[zen]] art; and was known in Japan by his Japanese name ''Ri Shubun'' or ''the Korean Shubun''. The entire tradition of ''needle points'' in Japanese art began with Yi, and continued through his students, known as the Soga School, a more natural group of artists than the courtly school patronized by the [[Ashikaga clan|Ashikaga]] shoguns.

While the Joseon Dynasty began under military auspices, Goryeo styles were let to evolve, and Buddhist iconography (bamboo, orchid, plum and chrysanthemum; and the familiar knotted goodluck symbols) were still a part of genre paintings. Neither colours nor forms had any real change, and rulers stood aside from edicts on art. Ming ideals and imported techniques continued in early dynasty idealized works.

Early dynasty painters include:

* [[An Gyeon]], 15th century painter

Mid-dynasty painting styles moved towards increased realism. A national painting style of landscapes called "[[true view]]" began – moving from the traditional Chinese style of idealized general landscapes to particular locations exactly rendered. While not photographic, the style was academic enough to become established and supported as a standardized style in Korean painting.

[[File:Korea-Nam Gyewoo-Hwajeopdo-01.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Hwajeopdo, literally picture of flowers and butterflies drawn by a 19th-century Korean painter, [[Nam Gye-u]].]]
Mid-dynasty painters include:

* [[Hwang Jipjung]] (born 1533)

The mid to late [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] dynasty is considered the golden age of Korean painting. It coincides with the shock of the collapse of Ming dynasty links with the Manchu emperors accession in China, and the forcing of Korean artists to build new artistic models based on nationalism and an inner search for particular Korean subjects. At this time China ceased to have pre-eminent influence, Korean art took its own course, and became increasingly distinctive.

The list of major painters is long, but the most notable names include:

* [[Jeong Seon]] (1676–1759), a literati painter influenced by the Wu school of the Ming dynasty in China; much taken by the Diamond mountain landscape.
* [[Yun Duseo]] (1668–1715), a portraitist.
* [[Kim Hong-do]] (1745–1806?) aka [[Danwon]] in his pen name, did highly coloured crowded scenes of common and working-class people in many natural work activities – his paintings have a post-card or photographic [[realism (arts)|realism]] in a palette of whites, blues, and greens. There is little if any calligraphy in his works; but they have a sense of humour and variety of gestures and movement that make them highly imitated to this day.
* [[Shin Yun-bok]] (1758-?) aka [[Hyewon]] in his pen name, a court painter who did paintings often of the scholarly or yangban classes in motion through stylized natural settings; he is famous for his strong reds and blues, and grayish mountainscapes.
* [[Jang Seung-eop]] (1843–1897) aka [[Owon]] in his pen name, was a painter of the late Joseon Dynasty in Korea and one of three great wons of [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] [[Korea]].

What calligraphy used is often discreetly done.

Other important artists of the "literati school" include:

* [[Yi Kyong-yun]]
* [[Kang Se-hwang]]

''[[Chaekgeori]]'' is a genre of still-life painting from the Joseon period of Korea that features books as the dominant subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hyun|first1=Eleanor Soo-ah|title=Korean Chaekgeori Paintings|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/chae/hd_chae.htm|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chaekgeori'' flourished from the second half of the 18th century to the first half of the 20th century and was enjoyed by all members of the population, from the king to the commoners, revealing the infatuation with books and learning in Korean culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=책거리|url=http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/kr/topic/%EC%B1%85%EA%B1%B0%EB%A6%AC/6591|website=Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture|publisher=National Folk Museum of Korea|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artists during the Japanese occupation ==

Korean artists from the middle 1880s til 1945 had a very difficult time when Korea was freed by the allies after the unconditional surrender of Japan.

From the 1880s onward, the emerging popularity of western art in Japan lead to a low opinion of traditional Korean art. Nevertheless, the formation of the Korean crafts museum in 1924 by Japanese philosopher [[Yanagi Sōetsu]] is a strong example of Japanese aesthetes who still appreciated Korean art.

Japan also held an [[:ko:조선미술전람회|exhibition of Korean art]] that produced many young Korean artists such as [[Park Su-geun]]. To this date there has not been a retrospective show of the hidden art under Japanese occupation, or a discussion of the conflicts between those who were forced into compromise under Japanese artistic demands. It is a sensitive issue, with artists who studied and worked in Japan and painted in the Japanese style forced into self-defense and justification of compromise without other alternatives.

Bridging the late Joseon dynasty and the Japanese occupation period were noteworthy artists such as:

* [[Chi Un-Yeong]] (1853–1936)

and others.

== Major 20th-century Korean artists ==

* [[Kim Tschang-yeul]]
* [[Park Su-geun]]
* [[Nam June Paik]]
* [[Chang Ucchin]]
* [[Seund Ja Rhee]]
* [[Lee Ufan]]

'''''Leonardo®''''' is a [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by the [[MIT Press]] covering the application of contemporary science and technology to the arts and music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/page/about/leon About ''Leonardo'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Leonardo journal was established in 1968 by artist and scientist [[Frank Malina]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leonardo.info/isast/leostory.html History of ''Leonardo'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''Leonardo'' has published writings by artists who work with science- and technology-based art media for 50 years. Journal operations were moved to the [[San Francisco Bay]] Area by Frank's son [[Roger Malina]], an astronomer and space scientist, who took over operations of the journal upon Frank Malina's death in 1981. In 1982, the International Society for the Arts Sciences and Technology ([[Leonardo, The International Society of the Arts, Sciences and Technology|Leonardo/ISAST]]) was founded to further the aims of ''Leonardo'' by providing avenues of communication for artists working in contemporary media. The society also publishes ''[[Leonardo Music Journal]]'', the ''[[Leonardo Electronic Almanac]]'', ''[[Leonardo Reviews]]'', and the ''[[Leonardo Book Series]]''. All publications are produced in collaboration with the [[MIT Press]].

Other activities of the organization include an awards program and participation in annual conferences and symposiums such as the Space and the Arts Workshop and the annual College Art Association conference. Leonardo has a sister organization in France, the Association Leonardo, that publishes the ''Observatoire Leonardo'' website. While encouraging the innovative presentation of technology-based arts, the society also functions as an international meeting place for artists, educators, students, scientists and others interested in the use of new media in contemporary artistic expression.

The aims of the organization include the documentation of personal and innovative technologies developed by artists, similar to the way in which findings of scientists are documented in journal publications.&lt;ref&gt;Leonardo de Cardoso: ''Visual Music: An Ethnography of an Experimental Art in Los Angeles'', Master's Thesis, University of Texas at Austin, May 2010, [http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/ETD-UT-2010-05-1228/CARDOSO-MASTERS-REPORT.pdf#page=47 p. 39]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

'''Nasum''' (pronounced 'nah-zumm') was a [[grindcore]] band from [[Örebro]], Sweden formed in 1992. The band released four studio albums, developed into "one of that country's premier metal acts"&lt;ref name="Allmusic Bio"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic |class=artist |id=p294468 |pure_url=yes}}|title=Nasum Biography |author=True, Chris |date= |work= |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and disbanded after the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|December 2004 tsunami]] killed the band's frontman, [[Mieszko Talarczyk]]. The band's name, [[Latin]] for "nose", was taken from the [[horror film]] ''[[Flesh for Frankenstein]].''&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, Anders. ''Grind Finale'' liner notes, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Nasum reunited with [[Rotten Sound]] frontman Keijo Niinimaa taking the place of Talarczyk, for a one-off tour to celebrate the band's 20th anniversary.

==Biography==
Nasum was formed in 1992 by Anders Jakobson (guitar) and Rickard Alriksson (drums/vocals), two former members of the band Necrony. The record label of Necrony offered Nasum a slot on a split 7". After [[Mieszko Talarczyk]] joined the band as a guitarist in 1993, the band was featured on Blind World split EP with Agathocles. After several more splits, Nasum released an MCD (mini compact disc) of their own with Poserslaughter Records in 1995.&lt;ref name="Allmusic Bio"/&gt;

As the band started touring, Alriksson departed from Nasum. Guitarist Jakobson moved into the drummer's position and Talarczyk handled guitars and vocals. More EPs and splits followed over 1996 and 1997; and in 1998 Nasum released their first full-length album, ''[[Inhale/Exhale (Nasum album)|Inhale/Exhale]]'', on [[Relapse Records]]. As the band expanded their audience and touring, they recruited a full-time bassist, Jesper Liveröd (from [[Burst (band)|Burst]]) in early 1999. The second album, ''[[Human 2.0]]'', was released in April 2000 and followed by two years of touring and performing in support of the work, including a stop in Japan.&lt;ref name="Allmusic Bio"/&gt;

The third album, ''[[Helvete (album)|Helvete]]'', was released in 2003, featured [[Napalm Death]]'s Shane Embury, was well received, and led to even more high-profile appearances, especially on the European festival circuit.&lt;ref name="Allmusic Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shane Embury and Barney Greenaway of [[Napalm Death]] both cite hearing Nasum, and ''Inhale/Exhale'' in particular, as a definite turning point which helped them to rediscover grindcore and thus led to the recording of 2000's acclaimed ''Enemy of the Music Business''.(''Terrorizer'' No.&amp;nbsp;140, Spring 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Nasum were joined by second guitarist Urban Skytt and bassist Jon Lindqvist, who replaced the departing member Liveröd. In 2004, Nasum released ''[[Shift (album)|Shift]]'' and continued with touring.&lt;ref name="Allmusic Bio"/&gt;

Talarczyk went on vacation to Thailand shortly before the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]]. His death was officially confirmed on February 17, 2005, and Nasum disbanded. A compilation, ''[[Grind Finale]]'' was released in 2006 and a live album featuring a 2004 show from Osaka, entitled ''[[Doombringer]]'', was released in early 2008.&lt;ref name="Allmusic Bio"/&gt;

In October 2011, Nasum announced a special one-off tour to celebrate the band's 20th anniversary the following year. Filling in for late singer Talarczyk was [[Rotten Sound]] frontman Keijo Niinimaa.&lt;ref&gt;http://nasum.com/2012/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; Anders Jakobson has since stated that Nasum will never reunite again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasum.com/qanda.php?all=all |title=NASUM.COM: Swedish grindcore since 1992 |publisher=nasum.com |accessdate=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Museum of Ireland - Decorative Arts &amp; History''' ({{lang-ga|Ard-Mhúsaem na hÉireann - Na hEalaíona Maisiúla ⁊ Stair}}) is a branch of the [[National Museum of Ireland]] located at the former [[Collins Barracks, Dublin|Collins Barracks]] in the Arbour Hill area of [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. 

The site, opened in 1997, also holds the Museum's administrative centre, a shop and a coffee shop.

This section has displays of furniture, silver, ceramics and glassware, as well as examples of folk life and costume, and money and weapons. The "Soldiers &amp; Chiefs" exhibition features military artifacts and memorabilia tracing Ireland's military history from 1550 to the present.  Other permanent exhibitions include ones on Irish coins and currency, silverware, furniture, the designer [[Eileen Gray]], Asian art, "Curator's Choice" (including a Chinese porcelain vase from about 1300 AD, the [[Fonthill vase]]), folklife and costumes, ceramics, and glassware.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.museum.ie/Decorative-Arts-History/Exhibitions/Current-Exhibitions "Current Exhibitions"], NMI&lt;/ref&gt; 

Included are artifacts such as [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] vases, gauntlets worn by [[William III of England|King William]] at the [[Battle of the Boyne]], a life belt and oar salvaged from the wreck of the [[RMS Lusitania]] and a pocket book carried by [[Wolfe Tone]] whilst imprisoned in the Barracks.

Special exhibitions are mounted regularly; in summer 2007, for example, replicas of six Irish [[High cross|High Crosses]] that were subsequently shown internationally.

The '''''Oddi Altarpiece''''' is an [[altarpiece]] of the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] painted in 1502-1504&lt;ref name="dates"/&gt; by the Italian Renaissance master [[Raphael]] for the altar of the Oddi family chapel in the church of San Francesco al Prato in [[Perugia]], Italy, now in the [[Vatican Pinacoteca]]. The altarpiece was commissioned for the Oddi family chapel in San Francesco al Prato in Perugia, was taken to Paris in 1797 (for the Musée Napoleon) and with 1815 brought back to Italy, not to Perugia but to the Vatican Pinacoteca.

== The crowning of the Virgin ==
The actions of the painting occur in two related scenes, one in heaven and the other terrestrial. Above the coronation shows the Virgin being crowned by [[Jesus]], while angels are playing music; while below the section depicts the [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] gathering around the empty tomb of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], whose body was [[Assumption of Mary|raised to heaven]] without corruption. [[Thomas the Apostle|St Thomas]] holds in his hands the [[Girdle of Thomas|girdle Mary dropped down to him]] as a testament to her [[Assumption of Mary|assumption]]. The saints raise their eyes to the heavenly spectacle.

== The predella ==
The [[predella]] (39 × 190 cm) is composed of three 27 × 50 cm paintings, showing scenes of The Life of the Virgin:
[[The Annunciation]], [[The Adoration of the Magi]], [[Presentation in the Temple]]

The '''Opera Awards''' is an singing competition, for professional Australian opera singers. It was established in 1986 with the purpose of assisting and developing professional Australian opera singers. This is achieved through programs of study with selected international educational institutions, engagements with professional opera companies, as well as through introduction, networking and educational opportunities with prominent members of the international operatic community.

The Opera Awards consists of a group of awards, including the YMF Australia Award and the Armstrong-Martin Scholarship, amongst others.  Major sponsors and supporters of the Awards have included YMF Australia, the Armstrong-Martin Estate, Haas Foundation, The [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera]] (UK), the [[Royal Over-Seas League]] (UK) and the [[Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust]].

== History ==
In 1986/87, [[Music &amp; Opera Singers Trust|Music &amp; Opera Singers Trust Limited]] (MOST®) created the 'Opera Awards' as a competition within the [[Australian Singing Competition|Australian SInging Competition]], and then as a separate, stand-alone competition in 2001.

The competition provides cash prizes, scholarships and career opportunities to professional Australian opera singers, enabling the study of grand opera and related music overseas.

Since 2007, the primary award within the Opera Awards is the YMF Australia Award, sponsored by YMF Australia. The recipient of the 'Opera Awards' actually receives a group of awards, scholarships and opportunities which include the YMF Australia Award, the Armstrong-Martin Scholarship, the Haas Foundation Award and the Editorial Resources Prize.

'Runners up'  receive prizes and opportunities which include (in 2011) The Royal Over-Seas League (UK) Music Bursary, the Britten-Pears Young Artists Programme, the Glyndebourne Festival Prize, and the 4MBS Classic FM Award.

The recipient of the Opera Awards (Australia) is acknowledged and invited to perform at the Finals Concert of the [[Australian Singing Competition]].

'''Directive 2012/28/EU''' is a [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] of the [[European Parliament]] and [[European Council]] enacted on 25 October 2012 that pertains to certain uses of [[orphan works]].&lt;ref name="Directive 2012/28/EU"&gt;{{cite web|title=Orphan works|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/orphan_works/index_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The directive sets out common rules on the digitisation and online display of orphan works.&lt;ref name="Directive 2012/28/EU"&gt;{{cite web|title=Orphan works|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/orphan_works/index_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a diligent search has been completed a work can be registered at the orphan works register of the European Union Intellectual Property Office. Registering a work at that database allows for certain permitted uses of that work by cultural heritage institutions.

==Basis==

Orphan works are works like books, newspaper articles, or films, which may be protected under [[copyright]] but for which the copyright holder cannot be found. A substantial portion of the collections of Europe's cultural institutions are orphan works (e.g. the British Library estimates that 40 per cent of its copyrighted collections, 150 million works in total, are orphan works).&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Memo – Orphan works – FAQ|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-12-743_en.htm?locale=en|work=europa.eu|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orphan works are not available for legal use by filmmakers, archivists, writers, musicians, and broadcasters. Public libraries, educational institutions and museums, that digitise old manuscripts, books, sound recordings and film, may choose to not digitise orphan works, or make orphan works available to the public,&lt;ref name= Netanel&gt;{{Cite book| last= Netanel| first= Neil| title= Copyright's paradox| publisher= Oxford University Press US| year= 2008| page= 200| url= https://www.google.com/books?id=vo9G-0iZNQIC&amp;dq=orphan+works&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =978-0-19-513762-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for fear that a re-appearing rights-holder may sue them for damages.&lt;ref name= Borgman&gt;{{Cite book| last= Borgman| first= Christine L.| title= Scholarship in the digital age: information, infrastructure, and the internet| publisher= MIT Press| year= 2007| page= 108| url= http://Google.com/books?id=ZDDu3CuzDdMC&amp;dq=orphan+works+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn= 978-0-262-02619-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU has set out large-scale digitisation programs (such as [[Europeana]]) and in order for these programs to be successful, common rules on how to deal with orphan works need to be established.&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo" /&gt;

==Works Covered by the Directive==

This directive applies to the following orphan works that were created in the EU:

* printed works (books, journals, magazines and newspapers)
* [[cinematographic]] and audio-visual works
* [[Sound recording|phonogram]]s
* works embedded or incorporated in other works or phonograms (e.g. pictures in a book)

Under certain conditions, the directive can also apply to unpublished works (such as letters or manuscripts).&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo" /&gt;
If orphaned software and video games ("[[Abandonware]]") fall under the ''audiovisual works'' definition is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiig.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Maier_JIPITEC-2015-120_Games-as-cultural-heritage.pdf|title=Games as Cultural Heritage Copyright Challenges for Preserving (Orphan) Video Games in the EU |accessdate=18 January 2016 |first=Henrike |last=Maier |publisher=[[Humboldt Universität zu Berlin]] |date=2015 |format=PDF |work=JIPITEC |pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==

The directive provides regulations on how to identify orphan works. An organisation that wishes to digitise a work in question has to conduct a scrupulous search to find its copyright holder. In this search, it should rely on sources such as databases and registries like ARROW&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arrow-net.eu&lt;/ref&gt; for text and image-based works. A registry for [[orphan film]] is currently developed by ACE – [[Association of European Film Archives and Cinematheques]] in the FORWARD project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.project-forward.eu&lt;/ref&gt; A diligent search guideline and tool has also been developed by the EnDOW project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heritageportal.eu/News-Events/Latest-News/EnDOW-Heritage-Plus-Project-Profile.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Its [http://diligentsearch.eu/ tool] for diligent searches is available for 20 European Union Member states. It is hoped that other sectors will develop similar information databases.&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo" /&gt;

The directive also establishes that if a search does not find the identity or location of the copyright holder, the work shall be officially recognised as an orphan work. This status shall be valid for the whole of the [[European Union]], which means the organisation will be able to make it available online in all Member States. The directive also foresees the establishment of a single European registry of all recognised orphan works that will be set up and run by [[European Union Intellectual Property Office|EUIPO]], the European Union Intellectual Property Office based in [[Alicante]].&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo" /&gt;

Works identified as orphan works can be used by beneficiary organisations to achieve aims related to their public interest mission. They will be allowed to conclude public-private partnerships with commercial operators and to generate revenues from the use of orphan works to cover digitisation costs.&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo" /&gt;

Under this directive, a reappearing copyright-holder can assert his/her copyright and thereby end the orphan work status.&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo" /&gt;

'''Perfection''' is a state, variously, of completeness, flawlessness, or supreme excellence. 

The [[terminology|term]] is used to designate a range of diverse, if often kindred, [[concept]]s. These have historically been addressed in a number of discrete [[academic discipline|discipline]]s, notably [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], [[ontology]], and [[theology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''O doskonałości'' (On Perfection), 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Term and concept==
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|80px|[[Aristotle]].]]
The form of the word long fluctuated in various languages. The [[English language]] had the alternates, "perfection" and the [[Bible|Biblical]] "perfectness."&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz1979p5&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Perfection: the Term and the Concept," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VI, no. 4 (autumn 1979), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "perfection" derives from the [[Latin]] "''[[w:la:perfectio|perfectio]]''", and "perfect" — from "''[[w:la:perfectus|perfectus]]''". These expressions in turn come from "''[[w:la:perficio|perficio]]''" — "to finish", "to bring to an end." "''Perfectio''(n)" thus literally means "a finishing", and "perfect''(us)''" — "finished", much as in [[grammar|grammatical]] parlance ("[[perfect (grammar)|perfect]]").&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz1979p5 /&gt;

Many modern languages have adopted their terms for the concept of "perfection" from the Latin: the [[French language|French]] "''[[w:fr:parfait|parfait]]''" and "''perfection''"; the [[Italian language|Italian]] "''[[w:it:perfetto|perfetto]]''" and "''[[w:it:perfezione|perfezione]]''"; the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] "''[[w:es:perfecto|perfecto]]''" and "''[[w:es:perfección|perfección]]''"; the [[English language|English]] "perfect" and "perfection"; the [[Russian language|Russian]] "''[[w:ru:совершенный|совершенный]]''" (sovyershenniy) and "''совершенcтво''" (sovyershenstvo); the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] "''savršen''" and "''savršenstvo''"; the [[Czech language|Czech]] "''dokonalost''"; the [[Slovak language|Slovak]] "''dokonaly''" and "''dokonalost''"; the [[Polish language|Polish]] "''doskonały''" and "''doskonałość''."&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz1979p5 /&gt;

The genealogy of the concept of "perfection" reaches back beyond Latin, to [[Greek language|Greek]]. The Greek equivalent of the Latin "''perfectus''" was "''teleos''." The latter Greek expression generally had concrete referents, such as a perfect physician or flutist, a perfect comedy or a perfect social system. Hence the Greek "''teleiotes''" was not yet so fraught with abstract and superlative associations as would be the Latin "''perfectio''" or the modern "perfection." To avoid the latter associations, the Greek term has generally been translated as "[[wikt:complete|complete]]ness" rather than "perfection."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Perfection:  the Term and the Concept," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VI, no. 4 (autumn 1979), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest definition of "perfection", fairly precise and distinguishing the shades of the concept, goes back to [[Aristotle]]. In Book ''Delta'' of the ''Metaphysics'', he distinguishes three meanings of the term, or rather three shades of one meaning, but in any case three different concepts. That is perfect:
:1. which is complete — which contains all the requisite parts;
:2. which is so good that nothing of the kind could be better;
:3. which has attained its purpose.&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz1979p7&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Perfection:  the Term and the Concept," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VI, no. 4 (autumn 1979), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these concepts is fairly well subsumed within the second. Between those two and the third, however, there arises a duality in concept. This duality was expressed by [[Thomas Aquinas]], in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', when he distinguished a twofold perfection: when a thing is perfect in itself — as he put it, in its ''substance''; and when it perfectly serves its ''purpose''.&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz1979p7 /&gt;

The variants on the concept of perfection would have been quite of a piece for two thousand years, had they not been confused with other, kindred concepts. The chief of these was the concept of that which is the best:  in Latin, "''excellentia''" ("excellence"). In [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], "''excellentia''" and "''perfectio''" made a pair; thus, for example, dignitaries were called "''perfectissime''", just as they are now called "excellency."  Nevertheless, these two expression of high regard differ fundamentally: "''excellentia''" is a distinction among many, and implies comparison; while "''perfectio''" involves no comparison, and if something is deemed perfect, then it is deemed so in itself, without comparison to other things.  [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who thought much about perfection and held the world to be the [[Optimism#Philosophy|best of possible worlds]], did not claim that it was perfect.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Perfection:  the Term and the Concept," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VI, no. 4 (autumn 1979), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paradoxes==
[[File:6655 - Roma - Ettore Ferrari, Giulio Cesare Vanini (1889) - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 6-Apr-2008.jpg|thumb|90px|[[Lucilio Vanini|Vanini]]]]
The parallel existence of two concepts of perfection, one strict ("perfection," as such) and the other loose ("excellence"), has given rise, perhaps since [[ancient history|antiquity]] but certainly since the [[Renaissance]], to a singular [[paradox]]: that the greatest perfection is imperfection. This was formulated by [[Lucilio Vanini]] (1585–1619), who had a precursor in the 16th-century writer [[Joseph Juste Scaliger]], and they in turn referred to the ancient philosopher [[Empedocles]]. Their argument, as given by the first two, was that if the world were perfect, it could not improve and so would lack "true perfection," which depends on progress. To [[Aristotle]], "perfect" meant "complete" ("nothing to add or subtract"). To Empedocles, according to Vanini, perfection depends on incompleteness ("''perfectio propter imperfectionem''"), since the latter possesses a potential for development and for complementing with new characteristics ("''perfectio complementii''"). This view relates to the [[baroque]] [[esthetic]] of Vanini and [[Marin Mersenne]]:  the perfection of an art work consists in its forcing the recipient to be active—to complement the art work by an effort of mind and imagination.&lt;ref&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Paradoxes of Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 1 (winter 1980), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[paradox]] of perfection—that imperfection is perfect—applies not only to human affairs, but to [[technology]].  Thus, irregularity in [[semiconductor]] [[crystal]]s (an imperfection, in the form of [[contaminant]]s) is requisite for the production of semiconductors. The solution to the apparent paradox lies in a distinction between two concepts of "perfection": that of regularity, and that of [[utility]]. Imperfection is perfect in technology, in the sense that irregularity is useful.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Paradoxes of Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 1 (winter 1980), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perfect numbers==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Perfect number]] --&gt;
[[Perfect number]]s have been distinguished ever since the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] called them "''teleioi''." There was, however, no consensus among the Greeks as to which numbers were "perfect" or why. A view that was shared by [[Plato]] held that 10 was a perfect number.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Perfection in the Sciences.  I. Perfect Numbers," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 2 (spring 1980), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mathematics|Mathematicians]], including the mathematician-philosopher [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], proposed as a perfect number, the number 6.&lt;ref name="TatarkiewiczSp1980p137"/&gt;

The number 10 was thought perfect because there are 10 fingers to the two hands. The number 6 was believed perfect for being divisible in a special way:  a sixth part of that number constitutes unity; a third is two; a half — three; two-thirds ({{lang-el|dimoiron}}) is four; five-sixths (''pentamoiron'') is five; six is the perfect whole.  The ancients also considered 6 a perfect number because the human foot constituted one-sixth the height of a man, hence the number 6 determined the height of the human body.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt;

[[File:EuclidStatueOxford.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Euclid]]]]
Thus both numbers, 6 and 10, were credited with perfection, both on purely mathematical grounds and on grounds of their relevance in nature.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt; Belief in the "perfection" of certain numbers survived [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], but this quality came to be ascribed to other numbers as well. The perfection of the number 3 actually became [[proverb]]ial: "''omne trinum perfectum''" ({{lang-la|all threes are perfect}}).  Another number, 7, found a devotee in the 6th-century [[Pope]] [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory I]] (Gregory the Great), who favored it on grounds similar to those of the Greek mathematicians who had seen 6 as a perfect number, and in addition for some reason he associated the number 7 with the concept of "[[eternity]]."&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt;

The [[Middle Ages]], however, championed the perfection of 6: [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and [[Alcuin]] wrote that [[God]] had created the world in 6 days because that was the perfect number.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt;

The Greek mathematicians had regarded as perfect that number which equals the [[summation|sum]] of its [[divisor]]s that are smaller than itself. Such a number is neither 3 nor 7 nor 10, but 6, for 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt;

But there are more numbers that show this property, such as 28, which = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. It became customary to call such numbers "perfect." [[Euclid]] gave a formula for (even) "perfect" numbers:
:N&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; (2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)
where ''p'' and 2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 are [[prime number]]s.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt;

[[Euclid]] had listed the first four perfect numbers: 6; 28; 496; and 8128. A manuscript of 1456 gave the fifth perfect number: 33,550,336. Gradually mathematicians found further perfect numbers (which are very rare). In 1652 the [[Poland|Polish]] [[polymath]] [[Jan Brożek]] noted that there was no perfect number between 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Perfection in the Sciences.  I. Perfect Numbers," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 2 (spring 1980), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite over 2,000 years of study, it still is not known whether there exist infinitely many perfect numbers; or whether there are any odd ones.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138 /&gt;

Today the term "perfect number" is merely historic in nature, used for the sake of tradition. These peculiar numbers had received the name on account of their analogy to the construction of man, who was held to be [[nature]]'s most perfect creation, and above all on account of their own peculiar regularity. Thus, they had been so named on the same grounds as perfect objects in nature, and perfectly proportioned edifices and statues created by man; the numbers had come to be called "perfect" in order to emphasize their special regularity.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138 /&gt;

The [[Greece|Greek]] [[mathematician]]s had named these numbers "perfect" in the same sense in which [[philosopher]]s and [[artist]]s used the word. Jamblich (''In Nicomachi arithmeticam'', Leipzig, 1894) states that the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] had called the number 6 "marriage," "health," and "beauty," on account of the [[harmony]] and accord of that number.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138 /&gt;

The perfect numbers early on came to be treated as the measure of other numbers: those in which the sum of the divisors is greater than the number itself, as in 12, have — since as early as [[Theon of Smyrna]], ca. 130 A.D. — been called "redundant" ({{lang-la|redundantio}}), "more than perfect" (''plus quam perfecti''), or "[[abundant number]]s", and those the sum of whose divisors is smaller, as in 8, have been called "[[deficient number]]s" (''deficientes'').&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138 /&gt;

Currently 47 perfect numbers have been identified.

==Physics and chemistry==
[[File:Robert Boyle.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Robert Boyle|Boyle]]]]
A variety of [[physics|physical]] and [[chemistry|chemical]] [[concept]]s include, in their names, the word "perfect."&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138 /&gt;

The physicist designates as a ''[[rigid body|perfectly rigid]]'' body, one that "is not deformed by forces applied to it."  He uses the concept in the full awareness that this is a fictitious body, that no such body exists in [[nature]]. The concept is an ''[[thought experiment|ideal]] [[construct (philosophy of science)|construct]]''.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Perfection in the Sciences.  II. Perfection in Physics and Chemistry," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 2 (spring 1980), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[plasticity (physics)|perfectly plastic]]'' body is one that is deformed infinitely at a constant load corresponding to the body's limit of plasticity: this is a physical ''[[Physical model|model]]'', not a body observed in nature.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

A ''[[black body|perfectly black]]'' body would be one that absorbed completely, radiation falling upon it — that is, a body with a coefficient of absorption equal to unity.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

A [[crystal]] is perfect when its physically equivalent walls are equally developed; it has a perfect [[structure]] when it answers the requirements of spatial [[symmetry]] and is free of structural defects, dislocation, lacunae and other flaws.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

A ''[[perfect fluid]]'' is one that is incompressible and non-viscous — this, again, is an [[ideal fluid]] that does not exist in nature.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

A ''[[perfect gas]]'' is one whose molecules do not interact with each other and which have no volume of their own.  Such a gas is ''fictitious'', just as are perfectly solid, perfectly rigid, perfectly plastic and perfectly black bodies. They are termed "perfect" in the ''strict'' (non-metaphorical) sense of the word. These are all concepts that are necessary in physics, insofar as they are limiting, ideal, fictitious — insofar as they set the extreme which nature may at the most approach.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

In a ''looser'' sense, real things are called "perfect" if they approximate perfection more or less closely, though they be not, strictly speaking, perfect.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

The relation of these ''perfect'' bodies to ''real'' bodies may be illustrated by the relation of a perfect gas to a real one. The equation of state of a perfect gas is a first approximation to a quantum equation of state that results from statistical physics. Thus, the equation of state of a real gas within classical limits assumes the form of the equation of  state of a perfect gas. That is, the equation of state of a perfect gas describes an ideal gas (comprising points, that is, dimensionless molecules that do not act upon one another).&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

The [[ideal gas law|perfect gas equation]] arose from the work of [[Robert Boyle]], [[Edme Mariotte]] and [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]], who, in studying the properties of [[real gas]]es, found [[formula]]s applicable not to these but to an ideal, [[perfect gas]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

==Ethics==
[[File:Head Platon Glyptothek Munich 548.jpg|thumb|90px|[[Plato]]]]
The ''[[ethics|ethical]]'' question of perfection concerns not whether man ''is'' perfect, but whether he ''should'' be. And if he ''should'' be, then how is this to be attained?&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p117&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] seldom actually used the term, "perfection"; but the concept of "[[Good and evil|good]]", central to his philosophy, was tantamount to "perfection." He believed that approximation to the idea of perfection makes people perfect.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p117 /&gt;

Soon after, the [[Stoics]] introduced the concept of perfection into ethics expressly, describing it as [[harmony]] — with [[nature]], [[reason]], man himself. They held that such harmony—such perfection—was attainable for anyone.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p117 /&gt;

Plato and the Stoics had made perfection a [[philosophy|philosophical]] watchword. Soon it would be transformed, in [[Christianity]], into a [[religion|religious]] one.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p117 /&gt;

The Christian doctrine of perfection is in the [[Gospels]] as well as elsewhere in the [[Bible]]. [[The Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 5:48 enjoins: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." &lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), pp. 117–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Early Christian writings, especially [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]'s, are replete with calls to perfection. Many of these are collected in a discourse by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], ''De perfectione iustitiae hominis''. They begin already with the [[Old Testament]]: "Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God." (''[[Deuteronomy]]'' 18:13.)  Elsewhere synonyms for "perfection" are "undefiled", "without rebuke", "without blemish", "blameless", "holy", "righteous", "unblamable", "unreprovable."&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p118&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Augustine of Hippo.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]]]
Augustine explains that not only that man is properly termed perfect and without blemish who is already perfect, but also he who ''strives'' unreservedly after perfection. This is a broader concept, of ''approximate'' perfection, resembling that used in the [[exact sciences]]. The first ancient and Christian perfection was not very remote from modern ''self-perfection''. [[St. Ambrose]] in fact wrote about ''degrees'' of perfection ("''gradus piae perfectionis''").&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p118 /&gt;

Along with the idea of perfection, [[Holy Scripture]] conveyed doubt as to whether perfection was ''attainable'' for man. According to [[First Epistle of John|1 John]] 1:8, "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us." Similarly Jesus said in Matthew 19:17: "And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God..."; while Jesus does not deny that he himself is good, he does call into question the idea that anyone but God can even be good, let alone perfect. And [[St. Jerome]] wrote:  "''Perfectio vera in coelestibus''" — true perfection is to be found only in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), pp. 118–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the 5th century CE, two distinct views on perfection had arisen within the Church: that it was attainable by man on earth by his own powers; and, that it may come to pass only by special [[divine grace]]. The first view, which was championed by [[Pelagius]], was condemned in 417 CE; the second view, which was championed by St. Augustine, prevailed at the very beginning of the 5th century and became authoritative.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p119&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, the Church did not condemn the writings of the [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Areopagite]], purportedly the first [[bishop]] of [[Athens]], voicing a ''natural'' possibility for man to rise to perfection, to the contemplation of God. And so, for centuries, two views contended within the Church.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p119 /&gt;

Even as, for the ancient philosophers, the essence of perfection had been [[harmony]], so for the [[Gospel]] and the Christian theologians it was [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], or love. [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] wrote (''[[Epistle to the Colossians]]'', 3:14): "And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness."&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p119 /&gt;

[[St. Gregory]] wrote that perfection will be realized only after the fulfillment of history — only "then will the world be beautiful and perfect." Still, everyone should make his own approach to perfection — to [[Sacred|holiness]].  Discourses in moral theology and [[asceticism]] were generous with advice on how this was to be done.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p119 /&gt;

The [[medieval]] concept of perfection and self-perfection, especially in its mature form, can be natural for modern man. As formulated by [[Peter Lombard]], this concept implies that perfection is a result of ''[[Personal development|development]]''. And as described by [[Giles of Rome]], perfection has not only personal sources ("''personalia''") but ''social'' ones ("''secundum statum''"). Since the individual is formed within a [[society]], the second perfection subsumes the first, in accordance with the "order of the universe" ("''ordo universi''"). The social perfection is ''binding'' on man, whereas personal perfection is only ''becoming'' to him.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p120&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

Theses on perfection persist within the Church to the present day. The first condition for perfection is the desire of it. Also necessary is [[Divine grace|grace]] — but God gives grace to those who desire perfection and strive for it.  Another condition for perfection is constancy of striving and effort. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] says: "He who stops, regresses." And effort is necessary in things not only great but also in the smallest; the [[Gospel]] according to [[St. Luke]] says: "He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much:  and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much." An aid in approaching perfection is an awareness of [[God]]'s perfection and of one's own imperfection.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p120/&gt;

[[File:John Calvin Titian B.jpg|thumb|100px|[[John Calvin|Calvin]]]]
The 14th century saw, with the [[Scotism|Scotists]], a shift in interest from [[moral]] to [[ontology|ontological]] perfection; the 15th century, particularly during the [[Italian Renaissance]], a shift to [[art]]istic perfection.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p121&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

The first half of the 16th century saw [[John Calvin]]'s complete conditioning of man's perfection on the [[divine grace|grace of God]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p121 /&gt;

The second half of the 16th century brought the [[Counter-reformation]], the [[Council of Trent]], and a return of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] concept; and also, heroic attempts to attain perfection through [[contemplation]] and [[mortification of the flesh|mortification]]. This was the age of [[Ignatius Loyola]] and the founding of the [[Jesuit Order]]; of [[Teresa of Ávila|St. Teresa of Ávila]] (1515–82) and [[St. John of the Cross]] (1542–91), and the 1593 founding of the [[Discalced Carmelites|Barefoot Carmelites]]. This was the culminating point in the history of the [[Christianity|Christian]] idea of perfection; at the same time, it was the terminal point as there soon began attempts at reforming the idea.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p121/&gt;

The first half of the 17th century saw attempts at a Catholic reform of the idea of perfection. This was the time of [[Cornelis Jansen]] (1585–1638) and of [[Jansenism]] — of a growing belief in [[predestination]] and in the impossibility of perfection without [[Divine grace|grace]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p121 /&gt;

With the second half of the 17th century came a further development in the doctrine of [[predestination]] — the doctrine of "[[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|Quietism]]." Perfection could be reached through a passive awaiting of grace rather than by an active striving. This theory, formulated in [[Spain]] by [[Miguel de Molinos]] (ca. 1628 - 1697), spread in [[France]], where it was espoused by [[Madame Guyon]] (1648–1717) and for a time attracted [[François Fénelon]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p121 /&gt;

The 18th century brought a sea change to the idea of moral perfection. Faith in it remained, but it changed character from [[religion|religious]] to [[secular]]. This secular, 18th-century perfection was a fundamental article of faith for the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Its central tenet was that ''[[nature]] was perfect''; and perfect, too, was the man who lived in harmony with nature's law.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Primitive man was held to be the most perfect, for he was closest to nature. Perfection lay behind present-day man rather than before him, for [[civilization]] distanced man from perfection instead of bringing him closer to it.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122 /&gt;

A second interpretation, however, took the contrary view: [[civilization]] perfected man by bringing him closer to [[reason]], and thereby to [[nature]]; for reason would direct life with due consideration for the [[natural law|laws of nature]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122 /&gt;

The former, retrospective view of perfection had antecedents in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]: [[Hesiod]] and [[Ovid]] had described a "[[golden age]]" that had existed at the beginning of time, and which had been succeeded by silver, copper and Iron Ages, each inferior to the previous. The renewal of this view now, after two millennia, was stimulated by European contact with the "primitive" peoples of the [[Americas]]. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was but one of many who wrote in a similar vein.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122 /&gt;

These two mid-18th-century schools of thought — one seeing perfection in [[nature]] and in the past, and the other in [[civilization]] and in the future — represented a reaction not against the idea of perfection, but against its [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] interpretation: as, earlier, the measure of perfection had been the idea of [[God]], so now it was the idea of [[nature]] or of [[civilization]]. It was the latter idea that ultimately gained the upper hand and passed into the 19th century as the legacy of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122/&gt;

The idea of perfection as transcendental, fell away; only worldly perfection counted. The idea that perfection was a matter of grace, also fell by the wayside; man himself must strive for it, and if a single man could not accomplish it, then perhaps mankind could. As [[God]] had been the measure of perfection during the [[Middle Ages]], so now man was: the measure had become smaller, more accessible. To the thinking of the 19th century, such worldly, human perfection might ultimately be attainable by everyone. And if not perfection, then ''improvement''.  This would be the great concept of the [[modern age]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122 /&gt;

At the very midpoint of the 18th century, there occurred an exceptional momentary retreat from the idea of perfection.  It was in the [[France|French]] ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. The entry, "Perfection" (vol. XII, 1765), discussed only technical perfection, in the sense of the matching of human products to the tasks set for them; no mention was made of [[ontology|ontological]], [[morality|moral]] or [[esthetics|esthetic]] perfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 123"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Otherwise, the 18th century saw great declarations championing the future perfection of man, as in [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''Idee zu einer allgemeinem Geschichte'' (1784) and [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]]'s ''Ideen'' (1784/91).&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 123"/&gt;

Perfection was expected to come about by a variety of means. Partly it would be by way of ''natural'' development and progress (the view espoused by [[David Hume]]) but more so by way of ''[[education]]'' (precursors of this view included [[John Locke]], [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], and the leaders of the [[Polish Enlightenment]]) and by way of overt ''state'' action ([[Claude Adrien Helvétius]], later [[Jeremy Bentham]]); reliance was placed in [[cooperation]] among people ([[Charles Fourier]], 1808), later in [[eugenics]] ([[Francis Galton]], 1869). While the foundations of the faith in the future perfectibility of man changed, the faith itself persisted. It linked the people of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] with the [[idealism|idealists]] and [[romanticism|romantics]] — with [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], the [[Polish messianism|Polish Messianists]] — as well as with the 19th-century [[Positivism|Positivists]] and [[evolutionism|evolutionists]]; [[Herbert Spencer]] penned a great new declaration championing the future perfection of man.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 123"/&gt;

The idea of human perfectibility had, however, become more comprehensive. Man would attain greater perfection, in the sense that he would live more rationally, healthily, happily, comfortably. But there was no adequate term for this new conception, as the term "perfection" had a moral coloring, while the new goal was more intellectual, physical and social.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 123"/&gt;

In 1852, [[John Henry Newman]], the future [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], wrote that it would be well if the [[English language]], like the [[Greek language|Greek]], had a term to express [[intellect]]ual perfection, analogously to the term "[[health]]", which addresses man's physical state, and to "[[virtue]]", which speaks to his moral nature. During the 19th century, the [[Germany|Germans]] would come to call perfection, thus construed, "culture" (''Kultur''), and the [[France|French]] would call it "civilization" (''civilisation'').&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 123"/&gt;

One of the elements of perfection, in its new construction, is ''[[health]]'', understood by the [[World Health Organization]] as "a state of complete physical and mental well-being."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 124"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, the burgeoning achievements of contemporary [[biology]] have not dislodged the age-old interest in moral perfection — with the important distinction, that the goal now is not so much perfection as ''improvement''. A classic early-19th century exponent of this view was [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 124"/&gt;

In the 20th and 21st centuries, the advances of [[science]] and [[technology]] appear to have been paralleled to some extent by increasingly pluralistic attitudes. The [[Poland|Polish]] [[philosopher]] [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]] (1886–1980) has written: "To demand of someone that he strive after perfection seems equally inappropriate as to blame him for not striving after it." Such striving, he adds, "is often egocentric and yields poorer moral and social results than an outward-directed behavior based not on self-perfection but on good will and kindliness toward others."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 124"/&gt;

==Aesthetics==
The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] viewed perfection as a requisite for [[beauty]] and high [[art]]. The [[Pythagoreans]] held that perfection was to be found in the right [[Body proportions|proportions]] and in a [[harmony|harmonious]] arrangement of parts. The idea that beauty and art were characterized by perfection, was subsequently embraced by [[Plato]], who believed that art ought to be "apt, suitable, without deviations" — in short, "perfect".&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewiczn p. 145"&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a conviction that perfection was a single quality, the Pythagoreans, Plato and their adherents held that beauty also was a single quality; hence, for every kind of art, there was but one perfect and proper [[Substantial form|form]]. [[Plutarch]] stated (''De Musica'') that, during the early Greek age, musical [[harmony|harmonies]] that were recognized as perfect were ''legally binding'' at public performances.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewiczn p. 145" /&gt;

Similarly, in [[temple]] [[architecture]] from the 5th century BCE, there were established [[classical order|orders]].  There were established [[Proportion (architecture)|proportion]]s for [[Doric order|Doric]] temples, and for [[Ionia|Ionic]] temples. Likewise in [[sculpture]], for centuries, it was a matter of dogma that certain proportions of the human body were perfect and obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), pp. 145–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a prevalent belief that certain [[shape]]s and [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportions]] were in themselves perfect. Plato felt that the perfect proportion was the [[ratio]] of the [[Edge (geometry)|side]] to the [[diagonal]] of a [[square (geometry)|square]]. His authority was so great that architects and other artists continued using this proportion, even when ignorant of its source, as late as the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 146"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|left|125px|[[Cicero]]]]
Another early idea — one that was to be espoused by many illustrious writers and artists of various periods — found perfection in the [[circle]] and the [[sphere]]. [[Aristotle]] wrote in the ''Physica'' that the circle was "the perfect, first, most beautiful form." [[Cicero]] wrote in ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' (On the Nature of the Gods): "Two [[shape|forms]] are the most distinctive:  of [[solid]]s, the [[sphere]]... and of [[plane figure]]s, the [[circle]]...  There is nothing more [[symmetry|commensurate]] than these forms."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 146"/&gt;

In a commentary to Aristotle's ''De coelo et mundo'' (''[[On the Heavens|On the Heavens and Earth]]''), the [[medieval]] [[Poles|Pole]], [[Jan of Słupcza]], wrote: "The most perfect body ought to have the most perfect form, and such [a body] is [[heaven]], while the most perfect form is the round form, for nothing can be added to it." In the famous illustrated ''Les très riches heures du duc de Berry'', [[paradise]] is depicted as contained within an ideal [[sphere]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 146"/&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] [[architect]] [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475–1554) stated: "the round form is the most perfect of all."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 146"/&gt;

The most excellent of 16th-century architects, [[Andrea Palladio]], held that "the most perfect and most excellent" form was "the round form, since of all forms it is the simplest, the most uniform, the strongest, the most capacious" and "is the most suitable for rendering the unity, infinity, uniformity and righteousness of God." This was the same thought as in Jan of Słupcza and in Serlio, and it was one of uncommon durability.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 147"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Middle Ages]] — [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[High Medieval|Gothic]] alike — had been quite taken with the idea of perfection. But a true explosion of the imperative for perfection came with the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 147"/&gt;

Renaissance aesthetics placed less emphasis than had [[classicism|classical]] aesthetics on the unity of things perfect. [[Baldassare Castiglione]], in his ''[[Il Cortegiano|Courtier]]'', wrote, of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Giorgione]], that "each of them is unlike the others, but each is the most perfect [''perfectissimus''] in his style." &lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 147"/&gt;

[[File:Daniele Barbaro by Titian.jpg|thumb|[[Daniele Barbaro|Barbaro]]]]
The great [[architect]] and [[polymath]] [[Leone Battista Alberti]] wrote (''De architectura'') that "the art of building... in [[Italy]] [had] achieved perfect maturity", that the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] had "created such a perfect art of building that there was in it nothing mysterious, hidden or unclear." This was yet another formulation of the concept of perfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 147"/&gt;

[[Daniele Barbaro]], in his 1567 translation of [[Vitruvius]], classically defined perfection as "that which lacks nothing and to which nothing can be added."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 147"/&gt;

The Renaissance showed a marked concern with ''preeminence'' in perfection. Leonardo concluded that the most perfect of the [[arts]] was [[painting]]. In 1546 [[Benedetto Varchi]] compared great masters in the arts. Others compared [[art]] and [[science]], [[art]] and [[nature]], and perfection in the arts of the ancients with that in the modern masters. The 16th century saw comparisons of their music, the 17th — of their [[visual arts]] and especially of their [[poetry]]. These comparisons construed perfection fairly loosely; the concept was treated more strictly by [[architecture|architects]].&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), pp. 147–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] distinguished a variety of properties to perfection. It was variously held to be:
* an ''objective'' property ([[Petrarch]], who opposed perfection to other esthetic qualities such as grace);
* specific to ''[[art]]'' rather than to nature ([[Vasari]]);
* a ''rare'' property ([[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]] felt that not even Greek architecture had attained perfection);
* a property of the ''whole'' work rather than of its parts ([[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]]);
* a conjunction of ''many'' values ([[Lodovico Dolce]] thought [[Raphael]] perfect because Raphael had manifold talent, as opposed to the one-sided [[Michelangelo]]);
* something that required not merely talent but art, that is, ''[[skill]]'' ([[Vasari]]);
* not the ''sole'' value in a work of [[art]] ([[Vasari]] differentiated perfection from grace; Renaissance [[Platonism|Platonists]] such as [[Ficino]] viewed perfection as a divine attribute).&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[eclecticism|eclectic]] view of the late Renaissance, perfection in a work would require uniting the talents of ''many'' artists. [[Paolo Pino]] held that only that painter would be perfect who combined the talents of [[Titian]] and [[Michelangelo]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 149"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of perfection was harder to apply to Renaissance [[literature]] but became so common — often, linked to "''eccelente''" — as to become banal. Its frequent application brought about its [[relativization]] and even [[subjectivity|subjectivization]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 149"/&gt;

Beginning with [[Sebastiano Serlio|Serlio]] and [[Palladio]], perfection in art had become less important, less definite, less objective. The striving for perfection no longer had the importance for [[man of letters|men of letters]] that it did for the great [[architect]]s. But the 17th century still revered perfection, as shown by the appearance of that word in book titles: ''De perfecta poesi'' by the [[Poland|Polish]] [[poet]] [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] (1595–1640); ''Le peintre parfait'' (1767 by [[André Félibien]]; and ''Idée de la perfection de la peinture'' (1662) by [[Fréart de Chambray]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 149"/&gt;

Sarbiewski offered several theses: poetry not only imitates things ''perfectissime'' ("most perfectly"), but imitates them as they ought ''perfectissime'' to be in nature; perfect art is recognized by its agreement with nature, as well as its universality; art is the more perfect, the nobler (''nobilior'') its manner of representing things; it is the more perfect, the more truths it contains; perfection has various degrees — it is higher in [[poetry]] than in [[prose]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 149"/&gt;

In [[classicism]], especially in [[France|French]] 17th-century classicism, from an ''ideal'' attainable by few, perfection became an ''obligation'' for every author. And inasmuch as the criterion of perfection had been lowered, "perfection" now meant only ''correctness.'' In the ensuing devaluation, it was not enough that art be ''perfecta'', it should be ''perfectissima''.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), pp. 149–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perfection, formerly the ''supreme'' characterization for a work of art, now became but one of ''many'' positive characterizations. [[Cesare Ripa]], in his ''Iconologia'' (published 1593, but typical for the 17th century), presented ''perfezione'' as a concept of equal status with grace (''grazia''), prettiness (''venustà'') and [[beauty]] (''bellezza'').&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 150"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s pupil, [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], in his ''Psychology'', wrote that beauty consists in perfection, and that this was why beauty was a source of pleasure.  No such general esthetic theory, explicitly naming perfection, had ever been formulated by any of its devotees from [[Plato]] to [[Palladio]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 150"/&gt;

[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|125px|[[Edmund Burke|Burke]]]]
Wolff's theory of beauty-as-perfection was developed by the school's chief aesthetician, [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]]. This tradition remained active in Germany as late as [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], who considered both [[beauty]] and [[sublimity]] to be ideas of perfection; when unity prevailed, beauty emerged; when plurality — sublimity.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 150"/&gt;

In the latter part of the 18th century, [[Immanuel Kant]] wrote much in his ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' about perfection — inner and outer, objective and subjective, qualitative and quantitative, perceived clearly and obscurely, the perfection of nature and that of art. Nevertheless, in aesthetics Kant found that "The judgment of taste [i.e., aesthetic judgment] is entirely independent of the concept of perfection" — that is, beauty was something different from perfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 150"/&gt;

Earlier in the 18th century, [[France]]'s leading aesthetician, [[Denis Diderot]], had questioned whether perfection was a more comprehensible idea than beauty. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] had treated perfection as an unreal concept, and wrote [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], "Let us not seek the [[wiktionary:chimera|chimera]] of perfection, but that which is the best possible."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 151"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England]], in 1757, the important aesthetician [[Edmund Burke]] denied that perfection was the cause of beauty.  Quite the contrary, he argued that beauty nearly always involved an element of ''imperfection''; for example, women, in order to heighten their attractiveness, emphasized their weakness and frailty, which is to say, their imperfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 151"/&gt;

The 18th century was the last for which perfection was a principal concept in aesthetics. In the 19th century, perfection survived only vestigially as a general expression of approval. [[Alfred de Musset]] held that "Perfection is no more attainable for us than is infinity. One ought not to seek it anywhere: not in love, nor beauty, nor happiness, nor virtue; but one should love it, in order to be virtuous, beautiful and happy, insofar as that is possible for man."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 151"/&gt;

In the 20th century, [[Paul Valéry]] wrote: "To strive for perfection, to devote endless time to a work, to set oneself—like [[Goethe]]—an unattainable goal, are all intents that are precluded by the pattern of modern life."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 151"/&gt;

The dismissal of the question concerning whether artists ''can'' achieve perfection, still left the question: Do artists ''want'' to achieve it? Is that their actual goal? Some artists, schools and epochs ''have'' aimed for perfection. Others have nurtured ''other'' goals: pluralism, novelty, powerful sensations, faithfulness to truth, self-expression and expression of the world, [[creativity]] and [[originality]] — all of which may roughly be summarized as "expression."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), pp. 151–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been ages of perfection, and ages of expression. The arts of [[ancient Greece]], the [[Renaissance]] and [[neoclassicism]] were arts of perfection. In the [[mannerism|mannerist]], [[baroque]] and [[romanticism|romantic]] periods, expression has prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ontology and theology==
The Greek philosopher [[Anaximander]] described the world as "endless" (''apeiron''), [[Xenophanes]] — as "the greatest" (''megistos'').  But while they ascribed great qualities to the world, they did not regard it as perfect.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 187"&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parmenides.jpg|thumb|left|80px|[[Parmenides]]]]
Only [[Parmenides]] seems to have considered [[existence]] to be "''tetelesmenon''" ("finished"); and [[Melissus of Samos|Melissos]], his successor in the [[Eleatics|Eleatic school]], said that existence "was entirely" ("''pan esti''"). Thus both saw perfection in existence; true existence was one, constant, immutable.  Moreover, Parmenides thought the world to be [[wiktionary:finite|finite]], limited in all directions, and like a [[sphere]] — which was a mark of its perfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 187" /&gt;

Parmenides' view was embraced to some extent by [[Plato]]. He thought that the world was the work of a good [[Demiurge]], and that this was why order and harmony prevailed in the world.  The world was the best, the most beautiful, perfect. It had a perfect shape (spherical) and a perfect motion (circular).&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 187"/&gt;

But Plato said nothing about the Demiurge architect-of-the-world himself being perfect. And understandably so, for perfection implied finitude, limits; whereas it was the world, not its creator, that had limits. A similar view was held by [[Aristotle]]: the world could be perfect, but God could not.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), pp. 187–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the [[pantheism|pantheist]] [[Stoics]] held the divinity to be perfect — precisely because they identified it with the world. [[Cicero]] wrote in ''De natura deorum'' (On the Nature of the Gods) that the world "encompasses... within itself all beings... And what could be more nonsensical than denying perfection to an all-embracing being...  Besides the world, there is no thing that does not lack something and that is harmonious, perfect and finished in every respect..."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 188"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a certain moment, Greek philosophy became bound up with the religion of the [[Christianity|Christians]]: the abstract concept of [[first cause]] became linked with the religious concept of [[God]]; the ''[[primum movens]]'' became identified with the [[Creator deity|Creator]], the absolute with the divine Person. Features of an absolute existence were discovered in the Person of the Creator: He was immutable, timeless. And absolute existence took on the attributes of a person: it was good, omnipotent, omnipresent. Christian [[theology]] united the features of the [[first cause]] in Aristotle's ''[[Metaphysics]]'' with those of the Creator in the ''[[Book of Genesis]]''. But the attributes of God did not include perfection, for a perfect being must be ''finite''; only of such a being might one say that it lacked nothing.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 188"/&gt;

There was another reason for the denial, to God, of perfection — in a branch of Christian theology that was under the influence of [[Plotinus]]. In this view, the absolute from which the world derived could not be grasped in terms of human [[concept]]s, even the most general and transcendent. Not only was that absolute not [[matter]], it was not [[spirit]] either, nor [[idea]]; it was superior to these. It exceeded any description or praise; it was incomprehensible and ineffable; it was beyond all that we may imagine — including perfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 188"/&gt;

[[Medieval]] Christian philosophy held that the concept of perfection might describe Creation, but was not appropriate to describe God. Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]], indicating that he was following [[Aristotle]], defined a perfect thing as one that "possesses that of which, by its nature, it is capable." Also (''[[Summa Theologica]]''): "That is perfect, which lacks nothing of the perfection proper to it." Thus there were, in the world, things perfect and imperfect, more perfect and less perfect. God permitted imperfections in Creation when they were necessary for the good of the whole.  And for man it was natural to go by degrees from imperfection to perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Duns Scotus]] understood perfection still more simply and mundanely: "Perfection is that which it is better to have than not to have." It was not an attribute of God but a property of creation: all things partook of it to a greater or lesser degree. A thing's perfection depended on what sort of perfection it was eligible for. In general, that was perfect which had attained the fullness of the qualities possible for it.  Hence "whole" and "perfect" meant more or less the same ("''totum et perfectum sunt quasi idem''").&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), pp. 189–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|[[Benedict Spinoza|Spinoza]]]]
This was a [[teleology|teleological]] concept, for it implied an [[telos (philosophy)|end]] (goal or purpose). God created things that served certain purposes, created even those purposes, but He himself did not serve any purpose.  Since God was not finite, He could not be called perfect: for the concept of perfection served to describe ''finite'' things. Perfection was not a [[theology|theological]] concept, but an [[ontology|ontological]] one, because it was a feature, in some degree, of every [[being]]. The 9th-century thinker [[Paschasius Radbertus]] wrote: "Everything is the more perfect, the more it resembles God." Still, this did not imply that God himself was perfect.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of perfection, as an attribute of God, entered [[theology]] only in modern times, through [[René Descartes]] — and in the ''[[plural]]'', as the "perfections" of God.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), pp. 190–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Descartes, the concept of perfection as a principal concept in philosophy was upheld by other great 17th-century thinkers. In [[Benedict Spinoza]]'s philosophy, however, there was no personal God, and perfection became a property of — even a synonym for — the existence of reality (that is, for the essence of things).&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 191"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] wrote: "As M. Descartes states, ''existence'' itself is perfection." Leibniz added: "Perfection, I call any simple quality, if it is positive and absolute, such that, if it expresses something, it does so without limits."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 191"/&gt;

At the same time, Leibniz also construed perfection, in his ''[[Monadology]]'', in an utterly different way: "Only that is perfect which possesses no limits, that is, only God."  This concept would last out the entire 17th century.  Subsequently, [[Immanuel Kant]] would describe perfection as "''omnitudo realitatis''" ("the omnitude of reality").  Thus perfection, which during the [[Middle Ages]] could be a property of any individual being, in 17th-century philosophy became as well, and indeed preeminently, a property of God.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 191"/&gt;

Leibniz's pupil and successor, [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], took up this concept of perfection — but with a difference. Wolff ascribed perfection not to being as a whole, but once again to its individual constituents. He gave, as examples, an eye that sees faultlessly, and a watch that runs faultlessly. He also distinguished variants — ''perfectio simplex'' and ''composita'', ''primaria'' and ''secundaria'' — and differentiated the magnitude of perfection (''magnitudo perfectionis'').&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), pp. 191–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolff's pupil, [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]], derived perfection from rules, but anticipated their collisions (''regularum collisio'') leading to exceptions (''exceptio'') and limiting the perfection of things. Baumgarten distinguished perfection ''simplex'' and ''composita'', ''interna'' and ''externa'', ''transcendentalis'' and ''accidentalis''; and, positing so broad a construction, he arrived at the conclusion that "everything is perfect."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 192"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, Wolff and his pupils had returned to the [[ontology|ontological]] concept of perfection that the [[Scholastics]] had used. The ''[[theology|theological]]'' concept of perfection had lived only from Descartes to Leibniz, in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 192"/&gt;

Thanks to Wolff's school, the concept of perfection lasted in [[Germany]] through the 18th century. In other western countries, however, especially [[France]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], in that century the concept of perfection was already in decline. It was ignored by the French ''[[Grande Encyclopédie]]''.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 192"/&gt;

The history of the concept of perfection had undergone great evolutions — from "''Nothing'' in the world is perfect", to "''Everything'' is perfect"; and from "Perfection is ''not'' an attribute of God", to "Perfection ''is'' an attribute of God."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 192"/&gt;

With [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]'s school, every thing had become perfect. This was a singular moment in the history of the [[ontology|ontological]] concept of perfection; and soon thereafter, that history came to an end.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 192"/&gt;

==Many concepts==
The foregoing discussion shows that the ''term'' "perfection" has been used to designate a variety of ''[[concept]]s'':
* The word "perfection" has a special meaning in [[mathematics]], where it gives a ''[[proper name]]'' to certain [[number]]s that demonstrate uncommon properties.
* In [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], "perfection" designates a ''[[scientific model|model]]'' — a conceptual construct for bodies that in reality do not precisely correspond to the model.
* Elsewhere the term "perfection" is used consistently with the word's [[etymology]] ("perfect" = "finished"). That is perfect which ''lacks nothing''. This is how the term has been used in [[ontology]] (a perfect being), [[ethics]] (a perfect life) and [[medicine]] (perfect health). In these fields, the concept is understood variously as ''ideal [[model (abstract)|model]]'' or as ''actual [[approximation]]'' to the model.
* Also called "perfect" is that which completely ''achieves its purpose''. [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] gave examples from [[biology]] (perfect vision) and [[technology]] (a clock that runs neither slow nor fast).  Here "perfection" is less fictitious [[model (abstract)|model]] than actual ''[[approximation]]'' to the model.
* That is "perfect," which completely fulfills its functions. In ''social'' discourse, one speaks of a perfect artist, engineer or carpenter. The term is used similarly in [[art]] criticism, when speaking of perfect technique or of the perfect likeness of a portrait. Here again, "perfection" is either ideal model or approximate realization of the model.
* In [[aesthetics]] and [[art theory]], perfection is ascribed to what is fully [[harmony|harmonious]] — to what is constructed in accordance with a single principle (e.g., the [[Parthenon]], the ''[[Odyssey]]'').&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz p. 11"&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "On Perfection:  Conclusion,"  ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 2 (spring 1981), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for the first, mathematical sense, all these concepts of "perfection" show a kinship and oscillate between [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]] and [[approximation]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz p. 11" /&gt;

However, the expression "perfect" is also used [[colloquial]]ly as a [[superlative]] ("perfect idiot," "perfect scoundrel," "perfect storm"). Here ''perfectum'' is confused with ''excellens'' of an approving, admiring or condemnatory kind.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "On Perfection:  Conclusion," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 2 (spring 1981), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perfection has also been construed as that which is ''the best''. In [[theology]], when [[Descartes]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] termed [[God]] "perfect," they had in mind something other than ''[[model (abstract)|model]]''; than that which ''lacks nothing''; than that ''achieves its purpose''; than that fulfills its functions; or than that ''is [[harmony|harmonious]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "On Perfection:  Conclusion,"  ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 2 (spring 1981), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PeterPan Statue Londres.jpg|thumb|Statue in Kensington Gardens]]
[[File:Michael Llewelyn Davies as Peter Pan.jpg|thumb|upright|Michael Llewelyn Davies as Peter Pan in 1906]]

The '''''Peter Pan'' statue''' is a bronze sculpture of [[J. M. Barrie]]'s character [[Peter Pan]]. It was commissioned by Barrie and made by Sir [[George Frampton]].  The original statue is displayed in [[Kensington Gardens]] in London, to the west of [[The Long Water]], close to Barrie's former home on [[Bayswater Road]].  Barrie's stories were inspired in part by the gardens: the statue is located at the place where Peter Pan lands in Barrie's book ''[[The Little White Bird]]'' after flying out of his nursery.  Six other casts made by the original artist have been erected in other locations around the world.

==Statue in Kensington==
The sculpture stands about {{convert|14|ft}} high.  It has a tall conical form, like a tree stump, topped by a young boy, approximately life size for an eight year old, wearing a nightshirt and blowing a thin musical instrument like a trumpet or flute, sometimes interpreted as [[pan pipes]].  The sides of the stump are decorated with small figures of squirrels, rabbits, mice, and fairies.  Barrie had intended the boy to be based on a photograph of [[Michael Llewelyn Davies]] wearing a Peter Pan costume, but Frampton chose another model, possibly James W. Shaw or William A. Harwood.

A completed plaster model of the work was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in May 1911.  Barrie had the original bronze erected in London on 30 April 1912, without fanfare and without permission, so that it might appear to children that the fairies had put it in place overnight.  He published a notice in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper the following day, 1 May: "There is a surprise in store for the children who go to Kensington Gardens to feed the ducks in the Serpentine this morning. Down by the little bay on the south-western side of the tail of the Serpentine they will find a May-day gift by Mr J.M. Barrie, a figure of Peter Pan blowing his pipe on the stump of a tree, with fairies and mice and squirrels all around. It is the work of Sir George Frampton, and the bronze figure of the boy who would never grow up is delightfully conceived." 

He donated the sculpture to the city of London, although some critics objected to him advertising his works by erecting a sculpture in a public park without permission.  It became a Grade II* [[listed building]] in 1970. A plaque was unveiled by [[Princess Margaret]] in 1997.

==Other casts==
Frampton made a series of small bronze reproductions of the Pan figure from 1913 to his death in 1928.  Examples were sold at [[Bonham's]] in March and November 2015, and one was sold in Scotland in 2016 for £60,000.

Frampton made six other full-size casts from the original moulds, which are situated in:
* {{Interlanguage link|Egmont Park|fr|Parc d'Egmont}}, in [[Brussels]], donated to the Belgian state by Frampton in 1924 to recognise the Anglo-Belgian friendship during the First World War; it suffered bullet damage in the Second World War, and was listed as a Belgian historical monument in 1975.
* [[Bowring Park (St. John's)|Bowring Park]], in [[St. John's, Newfoundland]], erected on 29 August 1925, as a tribute to Betty Munn, the daughter of [[John Shannon Munn]], who had died aged three on 23 February 1918 in the sinking of [[SS Florizel|SS ''Florizel'']].
*[[Sefton Park]], in [[Liverpool]], erected overnight on 16 June 1928; it was vandalised in 1990; restored, it was relocated to a position in the grounds of the [[palm house]]; it received a Grade II listing in 1985.
* [[Queens Gardens, Perth|Queens Gardens]], in [[Perth, Western Australia]], erected overnight on 10 June 1929, and donated by [[Rotary International]] to the [[Perth City Council]] to celebrate the centenary of the state of [[Western Australia]] (founded in 1829 as [[Swan River Colony]]).
* [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada; erected on 14 September 1929 by the [[College Heights Association]] in a park that became known as "Peter Pan Park" after the statue, but later renamed [[Glenn Gould Park]].
* The grounds of [[Rutgers University]], [[Camden, New Jersey]], by [[Eldridge R. Johnson]] in 1929, and located outside the Walt Whitman Arts Center.

The memorial to George Frampton in the Crypt of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] sculpted by Edward Gillick in 1930 depicts a young child holding in his hand a miniature replica of his statue of Peter Pan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.churchmonumentssociety.org/London_City2_StPaul.html|title=City of London – 2: St. Paul's Cathedral|publisher=Church Monuments Society|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other sculptures==
Other sculptors have created statues of Peter Pan, including two by [[Alistair Smart]] near the birthplace of J. M. Barrie in [[Kirriemuir]] in Scotland; [[Charles Andrew Hafner]]'s 1928 sculpture in [[Carl Schurz Park]] in New York City; [[Ivan Mitford-Barberton]]'s sculpture given to the [[Red Cross Children's Hospital]] in [[Cape Town]] in 1959; [[Cecil Thomas (sculptor)|Cecil Thomas]]'s 1965 sculpture in [[Dunedin Botanic Garden]], and [[Diarmuid Byron O'Connor]]'s 2000 sculpture at [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] in London.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6523">The '''Peugeot Concours Design''' competition was a [[wiktionary:Biennial|biennial]] competition run by the French [[car]] manufacturer [[Peugeot]]. For each [[competition]], entrants had to submit their designs for a car. A model of the winning design was built by the Peugeot Styling Centre and unveiled at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]]. The last competition took place in 2008.

==History==
The first contest took place in 2000-2001, with the theme "2020" - a challenge to design a [[Peugeot]] car for the year 2020. The contest was announced at the [[Paris Motor Show]] in 2000, and culminated in the winning design being built by Peugeot, and unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2001.  Since then, the contest has followed a similar schedule every two years. For the 2006-2007 contest, the winning design featured in an [[Xbox 360]] game.

==Themes==
Each contest has a theme, which contestants must follow when creating their designs:

==Rules==
The contest runs to a similar schedule, with similar rules, each year. In 2008, the contest opened in June, with the deadline for submissions on July 20. When the deadline for submissions has passed, Peugeot selects 30 entries to go forward to the next stage. These 30 entries are placed on the competition's website and are voted on by visitors to the site and selected industry and press figures. Based on these votes, these 30 entries are narrowed down to ten entries and these entries are posted to the website. This stage is not a majority vote - the ten entries which are selected may not be the highest-voted entries.

In the final stage of voting, the Peugeot Jury select the winner and 2nd and 3rd runners-up from the final ten. The results of this are then posted to the competition's website, usually some time in February.

==Winners==
===2000-2001===
The winner of the 2000-2001 competition was ''Moonster'' by Marko Lukovic. The concept behind this design was that the vehicle should be totally original. It features a wheel-level engine with a raised central compartment capable of seating two people.&lt;ref name="2001 winner article"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.cardesignnews.com/news/2001/010327peugeot-contest/index.html|title='2020' Design Contest winnder announced - car design news|accessdate=2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===2002-2003===
This contest, themed "Retrofuturism", was won by Stefan Schulze with ''4002''. With this design, the artist intended to make the car look like a typical Peugeot. Many commentators felt that he was successful with this, citing the design of the headlights as particularly Peugeot-like.&lt;ref name="2003 winner article"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/1722/Peugeot-4002.html|title=Peugeot 4002 - ultimatecarpage.com|accessdate=2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===2004-2005===
This contest was won by André Costa with ''Moovie''. His was an unusual design, almost totally enclosed by dark glass with few visible external features. The creator has stated that the car was designed to be environmentally friendly and ideal for use in cities.&lt;ref name="2005 winner"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peugeot-concours-design.com/en/01_vainqueur/|title=''Moovie'' by Andre Costa|accessdate=2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===2006-2007===
The 2006-2007 competition was won by Mihai Panaitescu with his design, ''Flux''. According to its creator, the car is intended to be sporty and versatile, and able to handle many different environments with ease. ''Flux'' is meant to symbolise "the continuous change and flow of our daily lives during work and play" - to this end, the car contains an integrated Xbox 360 console.&lt;ref name="2007 winner"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peugeot-concours-design.com/en/10vainqueurs/grandvainqueur/|title=''Flux'' by Mihai Panaitescu|accessdate=2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Portrait of Alof de Wignacourt with his Page''''' (c. 1607-1608) is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] master [[Caravaggio]], in the [[Louvre]] of [[Paris]].

[[Alof de Wignacourt]] joined the Order of the Knights of Saint John (the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]]) in 1564, aged seventeen, and distinguished himself the next year at the [[Siege of Malta (1565)|Great Siege of Malta]], when the Turks were defeated and never returned to the island. He was elected Grand Master in 1601, determined to enhance the prestige of the Order and its new post-siege capital, [[Valletta]]. It was not surprising, therefore, that he would welcome the opportunity to have at his court the most famous painter in Rome and Naples, Michelangelo da Caravaggio.

Caravaggio arrived in Malta from Naples in July 1607 and according to his early biographers [[Giovanni Baglione]] and [[Giovanni Bellori]], he began at once with portraits of Wignacourt and other knights from the highest ranks of the Order. This famous portrait shows the Grand Master in formal armour, holding his baton of command, every gleaming inch an image of the military might of the Knights. At the time Wignacourt was about sixty years old. He had [[Wignacourt towers|strengthened the fortifications]] of the island, built [[Wignacourt Aqueduct|an aqueduct]] to guarantee water to the city, and launched several attacks on the Turks. He had turned the Knights into a sovereign power, making himself in effect a prince answerable to no-one except the Pope, with his own increasingly wealthy court.

One of his innovations had been to surround to himself with young pages, in imitation of the fashion of the princely courts. The pages were taken from the most noble Catholic families of Europe. According to John Gash and others the page in the portrait is probably Nicholas de Paris Boissy, a French aristocrat destined for a distinguished career – he became Grand Prior of France in 1657. He is placed a little awkwardly within the composition: his feet are aligned with the feet of de Wignacourt, as if standing beside de Wignacourt, but his hand and the helmet overlap Wignacourt's elbow, giving the impression that from the waist up he is in front of the knight. The fact can be explained by Caravaggio's practice of painting separately from live models – de Wignacourt and the page were apparently not together in the studio at the same time.

The boy's lively expression and alert gaze make him an attractive subject in his own right, to the extent that he was several times copied by later artists visiting Malta.  Wignacourt, encased in splendid black and gold Milanese armour, stares upwards and outwards out of the frame in a dignified manner that invites the viewer to gaze upon him in awe, leaving the page, with his look of boyish interest, as the sole thoroughly human presence, and a far more sympathetic one than the self-conscious man of steel. The double-portrait with the pageboy was an unusual combination for the time. It may have been ordered by Wignacourt to stress the dignity of his court, or Caravaggio may have been inspired by a painting by [[Titian]] that he could have seen in his youth in Milan, ''[[Alfonso d'Avalos Addressing his Troops]]'', showing the Spanish governor of the city addressing his knights with a page beside him holding his helmet.

'''Pseudo-Jan van Kessel the Younger''' or '''Pseudo-Jan van Kessel the (II)''' is the [[notname]] given to an artist or workshop to whom or which are attributed about 200 small still lifes likely dating to the late 16th and early 17th century. The artist's works rely on combinations of a limited number of motifs in rather simple to quite elaborate compositions.  The motifs in the paintings are rendered in a rather naive and decorative manner.&lt;ref name=rkd&gt;[https://rkd.nl/nl/explore/artists/483442 Pseudo-Jan van Kessel] at the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the Flemish influence in the works hints at a Flemish artist or an artist who trained with a Flemish artist, the artist is believed to have been active in southern Europe, probably Italy.&lt;ref name=chris&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/pseudo-jan-van-kessel-ii-grapes-apples-5988666-details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5988666&amp;sid=f0ada0e2-206b-4be7-9ba3-462b1dd06653 Pseudo Jan van Kessel II (active second half 17th century), ''Grapes, apples, peaches in a blue and white porcelain bowl, with strawberries in a broken porcelain bowl on a stone ledge, with a monkey; and Grapes and peaches in a basket on a raised stone ledge, with a melon, figs and a turtle''] at Christie's&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification of the oeuvre==
[[File:Pseudo-Jan van Kessel II - Still life of fruit with a monkey and a dog.jpg |thumb|288px|''Still life of fruit with a monkey and a dog'']]
None of the works attributed to Pseudo-Jan van Kessel the Younger are authographed.  A large part of the oeuvre was catalogued in Klaus Ertz and Christa Nitze-Ertz, ''Die Maler Jan van Kessel : Jan van Kessel der Ältere 1626-1679 : Jan van Kessel der Jüngere 1654-1708 : Jan van Kessel der 'Andere' ca. 1620-ca. 1661: kritische Kataloge der Gemälde'', Lingen : De Luca, 2012 as the work of [[Jan van Kessel the Younger]].  However, Jan van Kessel the Younger's small known authentic oeuvre is different in style and execution and substantially higher in quality than the works, which have now been attributed to Pseudo Jan van Kessel the Younger. For the sake of convenience, the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] (RKD) catalogued paintings by Pseudo-Jan van Kessel II previously (until 2017) as 'studio of [[Jan van Kessel the Elder]]'.&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;

The artist is believed to have been working in southern Europe, likely Italy, during the late 16th and early 17th century.&lt;ref name=chris/&gt;  The themes and style of the works suggest that the artist was Flemish or of Flemish descent or was trained in the Flemish style.&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;

The artist should be distinguished from the artist referred to as [[Pseudo van Kessel]], who painted subjects that resemble those of [[Jan van Kessel the Elder]], particularly in the color palette, and in whose work the influence of [[Osias Beert]] and [[Jacob van Es]] is obvious. This Pseudo van Kessel was possibly a Flemish artist by the name of Raffo Morghen or the German painter Gorthard de Wedig (Cologne 1583-1641).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dejonckheere-gallery.com/en/Kessel_Pseudo-5.html?m=1&amp;id=72 Pseudo van Kessel, ''Still life with copperware, fruit and a butterfly''] at Gallery De Jonckheere&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
[[File:Pseudo-Jan van Kessel II - Still life of a basket of roses, vegetables and guinea pigs.jpg|thumb|290px|''Still life of a basket of roses, vegetables and guinea pigs'']]
The works attributed to Pseudo-Jan van Kessel the Younger often occur in pairs and occasionally in larger sets.  They are typically small in size and mostly painted on unmarked copper, occasionally on walnut panels, while one is executed on slate. The copper supports, as well as the fact that several of the works have an Italian provenance, suggest that these works were painted in Southern Europe, probably in Italy.&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;

Pseudo-Jan van Kessel the Younger occasionally borrowed motifs from Flemish examples, but only in one instance (a pair of gurnards) from [[Jan van Kessel the Elder]], with whose oeuvre there is no further direct relationship. The variety in quality of execution and their apparent mass production suggest that these still lifes were the product of a studio, rather than of one individual artist.&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1561">The '''Sarcophagus of Stilicho''' is a marble [[Early Christian art|Early Christian]] [[sarcophagus]] used since before the 10th-century as the base for the pulpit of the church of [[Sant'Ambrogio, Milan|San Ambrogio]] in Milan, Italy. It appears to have been made some decades prior to the death of Stilicho, and thus likely not associated with the Roman General. 

==Description==
The sarcophagus was carved from Marble from quarries near [[Como]], but appears to date stylistically from circa 390 and the reign of [[Theodosius the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1kSpN3Kfgc0C Early Christian and Byzantine Art], by John Beckwith, Richard Krautheimer, Slobodan Ćurčić; page 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The panels depict both New and Old Testament scenes including:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3-NhdelLo1oC DK Eyewitness Guide to Milan], page 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19104">[[File:Alfombra Huamantla.jpg|thumb|300px|Sawdust carpet made during "The night no one sleeps" in Huamantla, Tlaxcala]]
'''Sawdust carpets''' ({{lang-es|tapetes de aserrín}}) are one or more layers of colored [[sawdust]], and sometimes other additional materials, laid on the ground as decoration. Sawdust carpets are traditionally created to greet a religious procession that walks over them. The tradition of decorating streets in this fashion began in Europe and was brought to the Americas by the Spanish. The tradition is still found in Mexico, [[Central America]], parts of [[South America]] and parts of the United States, but it is strongest in Mexico and Central America.

The most traditional use of these carpets is for processions related to [[Holy Week in Mexico]] and Central America (especially in [[León, Nicaragua|Sutiaba, León, Nicaragua]] and [[Antigua Guatemala]]) and [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] in the United States. In Mexico, their use has been extended to processions dedicated to patron saints, especially in [[Huamantla, Tlaxcala]] and [[Huajuapan de León]], [[Oaxaca]] as well as to [[Day of the Dead]], especially in central Mexico.

==Creation==
[[File:Alfombras de aserrin de Acaxochitlán.JPG|thumb|Carpet in progress in [[Acaxochitlán]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]].]]
Traditional carpets in Mexico and Central America are done with colored and uncolored sawdust; however, various other materials are used with it and sometimes in place of it. These include flowers and flower petals, pine needles, rice, fruit, colored earth, ashes and other usually organic materials. The sawdust is cleaned, soaked in water with dye then set out to dry. In the past natural dyes such as [[indigo]], almond shells etc. were used but today most use commercial dyes. The finer and more compact the sawdust the smoother the finished work.&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leonmunicipio.com/uploads/1/3/8/2/1382165/manual_de_alfombras_pasionarias_de_aserrn_bc.pdf |title=Manual Básico para la Elaboración de Alfombras Pasionarios de Aserrín |last= Quezada |first= Federico |publisher=Municipality of León |location=Nicaragua |language=Spanish |trans-title=Basic manual for the creation of Passion carpets of sawdust |accessdate=November 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most traditional carpets begin with a layer of undyed sawdust spread in a wood frame to smooth out rough surfaces such as stone paved streets and then sprayed with a light coating of water. Sometimes other materials such as sand are used for the base. Then the designs are laid over top.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alusivo"&gt;{{cite news |title= Realizan en Huamantla tapete alusivo al 63 aniversario de la ONU |author= |newspaper=NOTIMEX |location=Mexico City |date=October 24, 2008 |page= |language=Spanish |trans-title=Create a carpet alluding to the 63rd anniversary of the UN in Huamantla }}&lt;/ref&gt; On smooth streets and other surfaces, the design can be drawn in chalk and filled in with the coloring materials.&lt;ref name="maubele"&gt;{{cite news |title= Colorful carpets made of sawdust |author=Michael Aubele |newspaper=McClatchy - Tribune Business News|location=Washington, DC |date=June 11, 2007 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two ways to create the design, with the use of molds or stencils and freehand, sprinkling and placing the colored material. Freehand takes longer and requires more skill with the use of molds allowing for very defined and complicated designs. After the carpet is finished, it received a very light spray of water to affix the sawdust in place and keep the colors from fading.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;

==History==
The tradition has its origins for the feast of Corpus Christi in [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]]. There the streets were adorned with flowers and sand, becoming more elaborate over the [[Middle Ages]]. The making of the carpets was then extended to [[Good Friday]] with images related to that day, Christ on the Cross and a grieving Virgin Mary.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt; The Spanish brought the custom to Latin America and it was established during the colonial period as part of Holy Week celebration, especially to welcome Good Friday and Easter processions of religious icons carried through the streets.&lt;ref name="kmcnaughton"&gt;{{cite journal |last= McNaughton |first= Kathryn |date=June 2005 |title= Sawdust Carpets |journal=Resource Links |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=3–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons these were promoted was didactic, with the images telling the story of the [[Passion of Christ]] and other scenes from his life. They were accepted by the indigenous populations especially in Mexico and parts of Guatemala as it was similar to traditions of laying fruit in honor of the gods of the harvest and carpets made from feathers of exotic birds such as [[hummingbird]]s, [[macaw]]s and [[quetzal]]s.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;

Today, the making of sawdust carpets is found in Mexico, various Central American countries Honduras, [[Brazil]] and [[Peru]] .&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kmcnaughton"/&gt; The carpets are made in some Catholic parishes especially US Southwest. In [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], the tradition was brought by [[Holy Ghost Fathers]] arriving from Germany.&lt;ref name="maubele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sspx"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sspx.org/district_news/2011_corpus_christi/2011_corpus_christi.htm |title= Celebrating the Feast of Corpus Christi |date=July 6, 2011 |publisher= Society of Saint Pius X |accessdate=November 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to concerns about preserving the tradition, in [[Nicaragua]] in 2000, a technique to create permanent designs in sawdust was created. Exhibitions of these permanent works have been held in Sutiaba, Managua and Antigua Guatemala. These have been created with both religious and secular motifs such as landscapes and [[still life]]s.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt; In 2011 the Honduran Embassy in the United States held an exhibition of various carpets at an event to commemorate Holy Week.&lt;ref name="presenta"&gt;{{cite news |title= Honduras presenta alfombra de aserrín en EE.UU. |url= http://old.latribuna.hn/2011/04/13/honduras-presenta-alfombra-de-aserrin-en-ee-uu/ |newspaper=La Tribuna |location= Tegucigalpa |date=April 13, 2011 |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Honduras presents sawdust carpet in the U.S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally the sawdust afterwards is burned or thrown in rivers which causes environmental problems.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt; For this reason some organizations adopt alternatives to sawdust. One example of this is students from Colegio Cedros Norte in [[Mexico City]], who make the carpets for Corpus Christi using grass mats and flower petals, which is more biodegradable.&lt;ref name="ecologia"&gt;{{cite news |title= Conjugan fe y ecología |author=Irma Valadez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=June 8, 2012 |page=4 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Conjoin faith and ecology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significant traditions using the craft==

[[File:AntiguaEasterCarpetMacaws.jpg|thumb|Part of a carpet made for Holy Week in Antigua Guatemala]]
The largest event which features sawdust carpets in Mexico is in [[Huamantla, Tlaxcala]]. The carpets are part of the Feria de Huamantla which extend over the month of August. All month the artisans create carpets in the atrium of the Basilica, the sanctuary of the city’s most important image the Nuestra Señora de la Caridad (Our Lady of Charity).

Since 1941, Nuestra Señora de la Caridad leaves its sanctuary in a procession that wanders for eight km around the streets of the city. The entire procession route is covered in carpets made of sawdust and other materials.&lt;ref name="lafe"&gt;{{cite news |title= La fe de un pueblo, es la noche que nadie duerme |author=Lucia Perez  |url= http://puebla.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/65b3d51e743bb2923f9d2cc8920f86ba |newspaper= Milenio Puebla |location=Puebla |date=August 16, 2012 |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The faith of a people, it's the night no one sleeps }}&lt;/ref&gt; The carpets are created the night before during what is called “La noche que nadie duerme” (The night no one sleeps) then trampled by the procession of the image in the early morning hours of the 15th.&lt;ref name="vochoa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lafe"/&gt; The carpets are organized and made by committees organized by the various neighborhoods. The procession and the carpets draw about 300,000 visitors each year.&lt;ref name="lafe"/&gt;

The making of these sawdust carpets have led to the town and some of its artisans being more widely known. One noted creator from Huamantla is Efrén Chacón, who not only participates in Huamantla each year, but has also traveled all over Mexico and to countries such as Spain, Italy, Canada and Japan to give exhibitions and talks.&lt;ref name="lafe"/&gt; His work with the carpets earned Efren Chacon a chance to meet [[Pope John Paul II]] when he and 222 other artisans worked to create a carpet with the image of the Pope with the Virgin Mary using sawdust and flowers. He has received recognition for his work from Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Italy, El Salvador, Guatemala and the United States.&lt;ref name="loinspiran"&gt;{{cite news |title= Artesanos de la Fe / Fabricantes de alfombras: Tradicion y fe lo inspiran |author=Juan Ramon Nava Flores |newspaper=Palabra |location=Saltillo, Mexico |date=January 16, 1999 |page=7 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Artisans of Faith/Creators of carpets: Tradition and faith inspire them }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, artisans in Huamantla also created a carpet 150 meters long and six meters wide with a design to honor the United Nations for its 63rd anniversary.&lt;ref name="alusivo"/&gt;

The tradition of making these carpets for patron saint processions has spread to other areas of Mexico. They are now made in the [[Tlaxcala, Tlaxcala|city of Tlaxcala]] for the procession of the Virgin Mary image of Octolán,&lt;ref name="milagro"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/un-milagro-un-recorrido-de-aserrin-y-flores-en-tlaxcala.html |title= Un milagro, un recorrido de aserrín y flores en Tlaxcala |author= Mayte G.

Although the tradition was adopted from that of Huamantla, Huajuapan since has developed its own characteristics such as the designs on the carpet. These include [[Mixtec people|Mixtec]] [[fretwork]], images from pre Hispanic codices and regional color schemes. The event draws over 10,000 visitors along the procession route.&lt;ref name="cariño"&gt;{{cite news |title= Tapetes de Aserrín, muestra de cariño al Señor de los Corazones |url= http://www.xeouradio.com/2012/07/19/tapetes-de-aserrn-muestra-de-cario-al-seor-de-los-corazones/ |newspaper=XEOU Radio |location=Oaxaca |date=July 19, 2011 |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Sawdust carpets, exhibition of love for the Señor de los Corazones }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of making carpets with sawdust and other materials has since been extended to include [[Day of the Dead]] in Mexico, especially for large institutional altars called ofrendas and ofrendas to honor important people such as a one for writer [[Carlos Fuentes]] who died in 2012.&lt;ref name="cancuntap"&gt;{{cite news |title= Elaboran tapetes de aserrín para conmemorar el Día de Muertos en Cancún |author=Elvira Espinosa |url= http://www.lapoliciaca.com/nota-roja/elaboran-tapetes-de-aserrin-para-conmemorar-el-dia-de-muertos-en-cancun/ |newspaper=La Policiaca |location=Cancun |date=November 3, 2010 |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Create sawdust carpets to commemorate Day of the Dead in Cancun }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dosgrandes"&gt;{{cite news |title= Rinden tributo a dos grandes |author=Imelda Robles |newspaper=El Norte |location=Monterrey, Mexico |date=October 26, 2012 |page=17 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Pay tribute to two greats}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day of the Dead carpets can accompany a traditional ofrenda on a table or can be the entire ofrenda.&lt;ref name="dosgrandes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="macro"&gt;{{cite news |title= Montan macro altar en memoria de víctimas de casino Royale en NL |author= |newspaper=NOTIMEX |location=Mexico City |date=October 26, 2011 |page= |language=Spanish |trans-title=Set up mega altar in memory of the victims of the Casino Royale in Nuevo León }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are most commonly made in the central part of Mexico. In [[Azcapotzalco]] in Mexico City, large carpets are made with sawdust along with marigold petals, corn, salt and candles for Day of the Dead. These include many made by primary school children.&lt;ref name="admirar"&gt;{{cite news |title= Aserrín, flores y maíz de colores para admirar |author=Berenice Balboa |url= http://www.eluniversaldf.mx/home/nota37133.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=November 3, 2011 |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Sawdust, flowers and corn in various colors to admire }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007 carpets dedicated to Day of the Dead are made in Guanajuato,&lt;ref name="lamuerte"&gt;{{cite news |title= Reciben a la muerte con tapetes de aserrín  |author=  |url= http://WWW.MILENIO.COM/CDB/DOC/IMPRESO/8858693 |newspaper= Milenio |location=Mexico City |date=November 3, 2010 |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Receive death with sawdust carpets }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the festival [https://www.facebook.com/ELTAPETEDELAMUERTE "El Tapete de la Muerte"].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/ELTAPETEDELAMUERTE&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the tradition has spread as far south as [[Teotitlán de Flores Magón]], Oaxaca where they are made to honor the saints and [[Cancún]] as part of their Day of the Dead festivities.&lt;ref name="cancuntap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="teotitlan"&gt;{{cite news |title= Realizan exposición de Tapetes de Aserrín en Teotitlán |author= Acela Guadalupe  |url= http://www.vozdelsur.com.mx/oaxaca/33260.html  |newspaper= La Voz del Sur |location= Oaxaca |date=November 4, 2012 |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Realize exhibition of sawdust carpets in Teotitlán }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been created as far north as [[Monterrey]], where one large carpet/ofrenda surrounded by 300 candles was made to commemorate the victims of a [[2011 Monterrey casino attack|massacre at the city’s Casino Royale]] .&lt;ref name="macro"/&gt;

In Central America, two noted events that feature the carpets is the community of Sutiaba in the municipality of [[León, Nicaragua]] and in [[Antigua Guatemala]], both of which maintain the original purpose of use during Holy Week. Sutiaba is an indigenous community whose tradition dates back at least to 19th century according to written record.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt; The carpets are made on what is called the Calle de Las Alfombras (Street of the Carpets) in the indigenous community of Sutiaba, meters from the San Juan de Dios de Sutiaba church. The carpets are created between Monday and Friday during Holy Week for the Good Friday procession. Each section takes about five to six hours with two to six people working on it depending on the complexity.&lt;ref name="exponen"&gt;{{cite news |title= Exponen tradicionales alfombras pasionarias de aserrín en Sutiaba |author= Jose Luis González  |url= http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/nacionales/247287-exponen-tradicionales-alfombras-pasionarias-de-aserrin-sutiaba  |newspaper= El Nuevo Diario |location= León, Nicaragua |date=April 6, 2012 |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Exhibit traditional Passion carpets of sawdust in Sutiaba }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicaraguan artist Federico Quezada has worked to preserve the sawdust carpet traditions of Sutiaba.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;

Another area famous for its carpets is Antigua Guatemala as it has mixed Catholic and indigenous images since the colonial period.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt; Antigua Guatemala carpets are generally made using molds with allegoric designs, religious symbols, Biblical scenes, geometric shapes and floral designs with entire families working together using sawdust, pine needles, fruit, flowers, sand and cut paper.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mantiene"&gt;{{cite news |title= Antigua mantiene tradicion religiosa |author=Oscar Rene Oliva |newspaper=El Sentinel |location=Fort Lauderdale, FL |date=April 10, 2004 |page=2 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Antigua maintains religious tradition}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carpets and processions in Antigua, Guatemala draw about 200,000 tourists from the country and abroad.&lt;ref name="mantiene"/&gt;

In [[Catalonia]], a similar tradition is called the Festa de les Enramades d'Arbúcies (Feast of the Bowers) related to Corpus Christi, which was declared a national heritage in 1999.  The tradition has been traced as far back as 1589. The Feast of the Bowers is eight days of festivities along with preparation days before when people collect large quantities of flowers and other materials to make carpets for the streets alone with tree branches. The color is mostly provided by the flowers. The elaborate decorations are then walked over by a parade of floats and other festive elements.&lt;ref name="festa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://patrimonifestiu.cultura.gencat.cat/Cicles-festius/Corpus/Festa-de-les-Enramades-d-Arbucies |title=http://patrimonifestiu.cultura.gencat.cat/Cicles-festius/Corpus/Festa-de-les-Enramades-d-Arbucies |publisher=Generalitat de Catalunya |accessdate=November 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spanner''' is a free program provided by [[Garmin]] for PCs running [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] 2000 or XP. It ‘translates’ live positional [[data]] from Garmin’s proprietary interface into [[NMEA 0183]]. Garmin’s proprietary interface data is only provided via [[USB]] whereas NMEA data is provided via [[serial port]]. Spanner overcomes this by creating a [[virtual serial port]] and thereby allowing a USB based Garmin [[GPS]] receiver to ‘speak’ with programs that require NMEA data. For users with Windows 7 and above, GpsGate Client is required. 

Spanner is offered as a tool for Garmin’s GPS 18 product, but it works with other Garmin GPS receivers including the GPS 20x, GPSMap 60cx, 76CS, Colorado series (software version 2.51(beta) or later is needed), Oregon series, GPSMap 62/78 series, and Montana Series.

'''''Sunrise with Sea Monsters''''' is an unfinished [[oil painting]] by English artist [[J. M. W. Turner]].

It is in the permanent collection of [[Tate Britain]].&lt;ref name=tate /&gt;

== Description ==
Turner created this painting in the coastal town of [[Margate]],{{sfn|Hamilton|2007|p=345}} in about 1845, near the end of his career. The painting, which measures {{convert|91.4|x|121.9|cm}}, depicts a hazy yellow sunrise over a turbulent grey sea. Lurking in the lower left corner are pink and red swirls usually identified as the eponymous sea monsters.&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-sunrise-with-sea-monsters-n01990 | title='Sunrise with Sea Monsters', Joseph Mallard William Tate | publisher=tate.org.uk | date=February 2010 | accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations ==
[[File:William Turner - Sunrise with Sea Monsters (detail).JPG|thumb|300px|Detail of the "monsters"|alt=Detail from Sunrise with Sea Monsters by J.M.W. Turner showing the area associated with the "monsters"]]
Beyond these basic elements, though, interpretations of the painting are the source of much study and open to speculation.{{sfn|Bockemuhl|2000|p=77}} The Tate Gallery maintains that the "monsters" are just fish.&lt;ref name=tate /&gt; The Tate and other sources posit that a small section of four or five black cross-hatches might be a part of a [[fishing net]].{{sfn|Bockemuhl|2000|p=78}} Critic James Hamilton speculates that the mist may hide a steam driven paddleboat being consumed by giant fish{{sfn|Hamilton|2007|p=345}} or whales, which were the subject of many of Turner's later works.{{sfn|Hamilton|2007|p=364}} This steamboat theory is consistent with the interpretation of many of Turner's other later works, as a response to the technological changes brought about by the [[Industrial Revolution]].{{sfn|Schultz|2009|p=205}} Other sources claim that the monsters really are just that: Michael Bockemuhl suggests that the swirls combine to form a single behemoth with large eyes and open mouth that is swimming towards the observer.{{sfn|Bockemuhl|2000|p=78}} They may also be compared to the monstrous creatures in the water of Turner's famous ''[[Slavers Throwing overboard the Dead and Dying—Typhoon coming on]]''.{{sfn|Bockemuhl|2000|p=77}}

An alternative interpretation is that there is nothing there at all; at least nothing corporeal. [[Gunnar Schmidt]] claims the painting has two zones—the warm sunny sky, and the cold dark water—and that at their interface is a mass of drifting steam that has particles and vortices but no shape or limit.{{sfn|Schmidt|2001|p=151}} In his view, it is this thermal process that is being compared to the "monstrous" power of industrial engines and machinery.{{sfn|Schmidt|2001|p=152}} Elizabeth Ermarth goes further, comparing this painting with Turner's ''Mountain Landscape'' and ''[[:File:JMW Turner-Seascape with Storm Coming On-1840.png|Seascape with Storm Coming On]]'', and claiming they are "almost entirely abstract representations of space as pure atmosphere, as pure medium of light."{{sfn|Ermarth|1996|p=60}}

Other shapes may also be interpreted from the painting. The Tate Museum suggests that a larger patch of red and white nearby may be interpreted as a marine float,&lt;ref name=tate /&gt; while a 1907 catalogue from the museum suggests that icebergs can be seen in the distance.{{sfn|Tate Gallery|1907|p=276}} Bockemuhl sees a dog's head in a shape in the water on the left of the monster.{{sfn|Bockemuhl|2000|p=78}} This varied and fantastic imagery is noted in many of the analyses of Turner's later works. A paper in the ''[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]'' draws a connection between these figures and Turner's possession of acetate of morphia (a drug related to [[morphine]]), possibly used for the treatment of a toothache.{{sfn|Woodruff|1980|p=389}}

The ''' Susan B. Anthony dollar''' is a [[United States]] [[dollar coin (United States)|dollar coin]] minted from 1979 to 1981, when production was suspended due to poor public acceptance, and then again in 1999. Intended as a replacement for the cumbersome [[Eisenhower dollar]], the new smaller one dollar coin went through testing of several shapes and compositions, but all were opposed by the vending machine industry, a powerful lobby affecting coin legislation. Finally, a round [[planchet]] with an eleven-sided inner border was chosen for the smaller dollar.

The original design for the smaller dollar coin depicted an allegorical representation of [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]] on the obverse but organizations and individuals in Congress called for the coin to depict a real woman. Several proposals were submitted, and social reformer [[Susan B. Anthony]] was selected as the design subject, much to the disappointment of most [[numismatists]] who preferred the original classic Liberty-head design. The [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] design of the Eisenhower dollar was retained. Both sides of the coin, as well as the rejected Liberty design, were created by [[Frank Gasparro]], the [[Chief Engraver of the United States Mint]].

One half billion coins were struck in anticipation of considerable public demand, but the Anthony dollar was poorly received, in part because of confusion caused by its similarity in size and metallic composition to the [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]]. Despite its poor reception, the coins eventually began seeing use in vending machines and mass transit systems, depleting the surplus by the late 1990s. In 1997, Congress passed a law authorizing the mintage of a new gold-colored one-dollar coin depicting [[Sacagawea]], but production could not begin quickly enough to meet demand. As a stopgap measure, until the new [[Sacagawea dollar]] coin could be issued, the Anthony dollar was struck again in 1999 after an eighteen year hiatus; the series was retired the following year.

Special coins for sale to collectors were struck in [[Proof coinage|proof]] finish through the run of the Susan B. Anthony dollar, and some minting variations are valuable to collectors. However, most circulation strikes remained in government stockpiles for several years after minting, so many of the coins are available in uncirculated grades, and the premium over face value is minimal.

In the early 1960s, as the price of silver rose, [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] vaults were depleted of silver dollars by the public.{{sfn|Yeoman, 2008|p=28}} No silver dollars had been minted in the United States since 1935,{{sfn|Yeoman, 2008|p=222}} and a shortage developed in the [[Western United States]], especially in areas in which gambling was common. As a result, Congress voted to authorize production of 45 million new silver [[Peace dollar]]s on August 3, 1964.{{sfn|Stevenson, 1964}} However, the move drew strong condemnation from critics who believed that the issuance of the coins was influenced by special interests, and that they would be quickly removed from circulation.{{sfn|Burdette, 2005|pp=98–101}} The dollars were subsequently melted,{{sfn|Yeoman, 2008|p=221}} and the [[Coinage Act of 1965]], enacted on July 23, 1965, forbade all production of dollar coins for a period of five years.{{sfn|Public Law 89–81}}

On May 12, 1969, the Joint Commission on the Coinage, a panel of 24 individuals organized by the 1965 Coinage Act,{{sfn|Treasury Department, 1968}} recommended resumption of dollar coin production following a study conducted by a Congressional task force.{{sfn|U.S. House of Representatives, 1969|pp=3, 40}} On October 1 and 3, 1969, a hearing before the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] discussed the proposed legislation to authorize the coin, in a copper-nickel clad composition, with the {{convert|1.5|in|mm|adj=on}} diameter of the former silver dollars.{{sfn|U.S. House of Representatives, 1969|p=1}} A provision was added requiring the coin to depict former President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who had died earlier that year, on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] and a design "emblematic of the symbolic eagle of [[Apollo 11]] landing on the moon" on the reverse.{{sfn|Public Law 91–607}}{{efn|Gasparro's alternative design depicted a less predatory eagle, but after details were leaked to Congress, the bird was mandated to appear on the coin as it was depicted on the Apollo 11 insignia.{{sfn|Julian, 1993|p=2851}}}} President [[Richard Nixon]] signed the bill into law on December 31, 1970.{{sfn|Public Law 91–607}} Both the obverse and reverse designs were created by [[Frank Gasparro]], the [[Chief Engraver of the United States Mint]].{{sfn|Yeoman, 2008|p=222}}

The coin, known as the [[Eisenhower dollar]], proved unpopular with the public, and very few of the coins were found in circulation.{{sfn|Bailey, 1974|p=9}} In 1976, the [[RTI International|Research Triangle Institute]] conducted a survey of United States coinage. Among other things, they recommended the half dollar, which also saw little use, be entirely eliminated from production, and the size of the dollar be reduced.{{sfn|U.S. Senate, 1978b|p=30}} Their report read in part: &lt;blockquote&gt;A conveniently-sized dollar coin would significantly broaden the capabilities of consumers for cash transactions, especially with machines. Members of the automatic merchandising industry have expressed a strong interest in a smaller dollar, indicating their willingness to adapt their machinery to its use.{{sfn|U.S. Senate, 1978b|p=30}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Numismatic historian David L. Ganz suggested that Eisenhower, a [[Republican (United States)|Republican]], was chosen as a means of balancing [[Kennedy half dollar|the half dollar]], depicting [[Democrat (United States)|Democrat]] [[John F. Kennedy]].{{sfn|Ganz, 1977|p=205}} In a 1977 paper, he agreed with the findings of the Institute, suggesting that both coins should be eliminated; the half dollar production ceased entirely, and the dollar replaced by one of smaller diameter and with a different design.{{sfn|Ganz, 1977|p=205}} Treasury officials desired the small dollar coin as a cost-saving measure; [[Director of the United States Mint|Mint Director]] [[Stella Hackel Sims|Stella Hackel]] estimated that replacing half of the issued dollar bills with small dollars would save $19 million (${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|19,000,000|1978}}}} today) in annual production costs.{{sfn|U.S. Senate, 1978b|p=110}}{{efn|Although paper notes are less costly to print, a dollar coin is considerably more durable and requires less frequent replacement.{{sfn|Caskey &amp; St. Laurent, 1994|pp=497–498}}}}

== Design history ==

=== Liberty design ===

The [[United States Mint|Mint]] began preparation for the reduced-diameter dollar coin in 1976. Although no legislation had yet been introduced, Treasury officials anticipated a positive reception from Congress, and the coin had near unanimous support from the Mint and the vending machine industry, an influential lobby in the area of coin design and creation.{{sfn|Ganz, 1976|p=54}} In 1977, [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Michael Blumenthal]] publicly endorsed a smaller dollar coin and suggested that an allegorical representation of [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]] would be a suitable subject for the coin.{{sfn|Julian, 1993|p=2929}}

}}

Chief Engraver Gasparro was tasked with creating a design for the proposed coin. His obverse design depicted a bust of Liberty, while his reverse depicted a soaring eagle.{{sfn|Ganz, 1976|p=55}} The bust was pictured along with a pole, atop which sat a [[Phrygian cap]], a symbol used to represent freedom.{{sfn|Ganz, 1976|p=55}} Gasparro's Liberty design was based on a similar obverse that he created for a 1969 [[American Numismatic Association]] convention medal.{{sfn|Ganz, 1976|p=55}} The reverse, depicting an eagle flying above a mountain against the rising sun, was originally created by Gasparro in 1967 for a proposed commemorative half dollar.{{sfn|Ganz, 1976|pp=55–56}} Describing the reverse design, Gasparro stated that it was meant to symbolize "a new day being born".{{sfn|Ganz, 1976|p=56}}

The design was reviewed by the [[Commission of Fine Arts]], and in an April 29, 1976, letter, Commission member [[J. Carter Brown]] praised the design: &lt;blockquote&gt;I believe this would be a superb design for United States Coinage, rooted as it is in a great tradition, being based on the '[[Liberty Cap large cent|Liberty Cap cent]]' of 1794, following [[Augustin Dupré]]'s ''Libertas Americana'' medal commemorating [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] and [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] (1777–1781).{{sfn|U.S. House of Representatives, 1978|p=13}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A bill to reduce the diameter of the dollar from {{convert|1.5|in|mm}} to {{convert|1.043|in|mm}} and the weight from 22.68 grams to 8.5 grams was introduced to the House of Representatives on May 1, 1978.{{sfn|U.S. House of Representatives, 1978|p=2}} The bill was introduced to the Senate on May 3, and the proposed weight was reduced from 8.5 grams to 8.1 grams.{{sfn|U.S. Senate, 1978a|pp=1–2}} The Mint conducted experiments involving eight-, ten-, eleven- and thirteen-sided coins,{{sfn|Ganz, 1976|p=55}} but it was decided that the dollar would be round, as costly modifications would be required to update vending machinery to accept other shapes.{{sfn|Logan, 1979a|p=46}} Instead, the bill prescribed an eleven-sided inner border, which was intended to aid identification by sight and by feel for the visually handicapped.{{sfn|U.S. House of Representatives, 1978|p=7}}

=== Selection of Susan B. Anthony ===

Treasury officials officially recommended Gasparro's design, which they referred to as a "modernized version of the classic Liberty design".{{sfn|U.S. Senate, 1978a|pp=5–6}} On May 3, 1978, Wisconsin's [[William Proxmire]] introduced legislation in the Senate which was identical to the Treasury proposal, except for mandating a design which was altered to social reformer [[Susan B. Anthony]] in place of the allegorical Liberty.{{sfn|U.S. House of Representatives, 1978|pp=36–37}} On May 15, Representatives [[Mary Rose Oakar]] and [[Patricia Schroeder]] introduced similar legislation to the House of Representatives.{{sfn|U.S. House of Representatives, 1978|p=2}} Anthony was also recommended by members of the [[National Organization for Women]], the [[Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues|Congresswomen's Caucus]], the [[National Women's Political Caucus]] and the [[League of Women Voters]].{{sfn|U.S. House of Representatives, 1978|pp=104–106}} In support of the proposed legislation, the League addressed a letter to [[Walter E. Fauntroy]], chairman of the Subcommittee on Historic Preservation and Coinage, reading in part: &lt;blockquote&gt;The League believes that the time has come, and is indeed long past, for the likeness of a prominent American woman to be placed on a denomination of U.S. currency. We believe strongly that the likeness should be that of an actual woman and not that of an imaginary or symbolic figure. Susan B. Anthony contributed immeasurably to the advancement of human dignity in this nation. It is entirely fitting and appropriate that her memory be honored through this measure.{{sfn|U.S. House of Representatives, 1978|p=107}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; In addition, officials tallied suggestions sent to the Mint by the general public as to the subject of the dollar coin, and Susan B. Anthony had received the most support.{{sfn|U.S. House of Representatives, 1978|p=97}}

}}

Gasparro began work on his Susan B. Anthony design in June 1978, before the legislation was authorized by Congress.{{sfn|Reiter, 1979a|p=116}} He enlisted the help of a friend in conducting research on Anthony, which he felt was necessary before creating the design.{{sfn|Reiter, 1979a|pp=116–117}} He referenced approximately six different images while creating the portrait of Anthony, but it was based largely on just two.{{sfn|Reiter, 1979a|p=117}} Gasparro created several different designs before receiving final approval. One of his portraits, depicting Anthony at age 28, was shown to Anthony's great-niece, Susan B. Anthony III, who rejected it on the grounds that it unnecessarily "prettified" her great-aunt, and she criticized another design depicting Anthony at age 84, which she believed made her appear too old.{{sfn|Martin, 2010|pp=224–225}}{{sfn|Woo, 2001}} Gasparro made several alterations with the intent to depict her at age 50, at the peak of her influence as a social reformer, but no photographs of her during that period were available.{{sfn|Reiter, 1979a|p=117}} He eventually received approval after modification, later stating his belief that he had accurately portrayed Anthony.{{sfn|Reiter, 1979a|p=117}}

Initially, Gasparro expected that Congress would authorize his soaring eagle reverse design to accompany the Susan B. Anthony obverse.{{sfn|Reiter, 1979a|p=117}} However, an amendment introduced by Utah Senator [[Jake Garn]] altered the legislation to maintain the Apollo 11 design in use on the Eisenhower dollar reverse.{{sfn|U.S. Senate, 1978a|p=2}}

The bill was approved by Congress and signed into law by President [[Jimmy Carter]] on October 10, 1978,{{sfn|Public Law 95–447}} and production of Eisenhower dollars ceased during that year.{{sfn|Yeoman, 2008|p=224}} After he signed the bill into law, Carter issued a statement, saying in part that he was confident that "this act—and the new dollar—will substantially improve our coinage system as well as cutting Government coin production costs."{{sfn|Carter, 1979|p=1737}} He went on to declare his approval of the decision to depict Anthony on the coins:&lt;blockquote&gt;I am particularly pleased that the new dollar coin will—for the first time in history—bear the image of a great American woman. The life of Susan B. Anthony exemplifies the ideals for which our country stands. The 'Anthony dollar' will symbolize for all American women the achievement of their unalienable right to vote. It will be a constant reminder of the continuing struggle for the equality of all Americans.{{sfn|Carter, 1979|p=1737}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Design criticism ===

[[File:Apollo 11 insignia.png|thumb|alt=A logo depicting an eagle upon the surface of the moon|Numismatists criticized the pairing of Susan B. Anthony's portrait with a design based on the Apollo 11 insignia.]]

Gasparro regarded the Anthony design as the most important of his career. Remarking on the public perception of the coin, Gasparro related that "it's become part of a social movement. This new dollar's more than a coin; it's an issue."{{sfn|Reiter, 1979a|p=116}} The decision to use a portrait of Susan B. Anthony in place of the allegorical Liberty was met with criticism by most numismatists, who believed that the latter had greater artistic merit.{{sfn|Reiter, 1979a|p=116}} Art critic and numismatist [[Cornelius Clarkson Vermeule III|Cornelius Vermeule]] was critical of the obverse design replacement, as well as the decision to continue use of the Apollo 11 design.{{sfn|Reiter, 1979b|p=46}} Vermeule noted that although Eisenhower's administration established the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], Anthony had no connection to the moon landing or the U.S. space program.{{sfn|Reiter, 1979b|p=48}} Commenting on the obverse and reverse pairing, he stated his belief that it was "a hasty marriage and a bad one".{{sfn|Reiter, 1979b|pp=48–50}} Although he believed that Gasparro's design was well executed, sculptor [[Robert Weinman]] criticized the decision to depict Anthony.{{sfn|Reiter, 1979b|p=50}} Concerned about the possibility of other groups seeking representation on the coinage in response to its passage, Weinman characterized the Susan B. Anthony dollar legislation as a "billboard or campaign button approach to a national coin".{{sfn|Reiter, 1979b|p=50}}

== Reception ==

[[File:Small dollar and quarter comparison.jpeg|thumb|left|300px|alt=Two coins being shown together as a comparison of their size|The similarity in size and material composition between the Susan B. Anthony dollar (left) and the [[Washington quarter]] (right) caused confusion in transactions.]]

The first Susan B. Anthony dollars were struck at the [[Philadelphia Mint]] on December 13, 1978.{{sfn|Stevens &amp; Ganz, 1979|p=33}} First strikes at the [[Denver Mint|Denver]] and [[San Francisco Mint]]s followed on January 9, 1979 and January 29, respectively.{{sfn|Hackel, 1979|p=25}} Mint officials feared that the coins would be hoarded upon release, so they ordered the creation of a stockpile consisting of 500 million coins prior to the release date in July 1979.{{sfn|Julian, 1993|p=2931}} The dollars all bore a [[mint mark]] denoting their place of origin: 'P' for the Philadelphia Mint, 'D' for the Denver Mint and 'S' for the San Francisco Mint. The Anthony dollar was the first coin to bear a 'P' mint mark since the [[Jefferson nickel]] issued during [[World War II]]; other coins struck there were left without a mintmark to note their place of origin.{{sfn|Martin, 2010|p=225}} In 1980, the 'P' mint mark was added to all other circulating coins, except the [[Penny (United States coin)|cent]], struck in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Martin, 2010|p=225}}

The Treasury Department, in cooperation with the Federal Reserve, undertook a $655,000 marketing campaign to educate bank employees and members of the public about the new coin,{{sfn|Wolenik, 1979|p=8}} and the vending industry engaged in a $100 million effort to retrofit machines to accept the coins.{{sfn|Ganz, 1979|p=44}}

Despite the marketing attempts, the coin received an overwhelmingly negative reception from the public.{{sfn|Schwager, 2014|p=60}}{{sfn|Logan, 1979b|p=42}} Less than two millimeters in diameter larger than the [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]] and struck in the same copper-nickel composition, the Susan B. Anthony dollar was widely confused for that denomination in transactions.{{sfn|Logan, 1979b|p=42}} Mint Director Hackel noted the difference in weight and design between the two coins and expressed her belief that the dollar would eventually find favor with the public, suggesting that the coin would become "customary to the American people in time".{{sfn|Logan, 1979b|p=42}} In the months following its release, complaints mounted and public transportation and many establishments throughout the country began refusing to accept them in payment.{{sfn|Ganz, 1979|p=44}} On July 13, 1979, California Representative [[Jerry Lewis (California politician)|Jerry Lewis]] introduced a bill to the House of Representatives with the intent to increase the size of the coin to aid identification.{{sfn|U.S. House of Representatives, 1979}} Discussing the bill, which was never passed, Lewis remarked that the Anthony dollar had come to be known derisively as the "Carter quarter", due to its size and association with the President.{{sfn|The San Bernardino County Sun, 1979|p=C-5}}

In total, 757,813,744 dollar coins dated 1979 were struck for circulation at the Philadelphia, Denver and San Francisco Mints.{{sfn|Yeoman, 2008|p=225}} Demand remained low through 1980, and the circulation strikes for that year totaled 89,660,708.{{sfn|Yeoman, 2008|p=225}} Due to its persistent unpopularity, production of Anthony dollars for circulation was suspended, and 9,742,000 1981 dollars were struck across all three Mints exclusively for sale to collectors; this mintage marked the end of production.{{sfn|Yeoman, 2008|p=225}} At the close of production, the Treasury encountered a dilemma: the Mint struck a large number of dollars in anticipation of great public demand, resulting in a surplus of 520,000,000 coins in 1981.{{sfn|Reiter, 1981}} Melting the coins was impractical; the cost of manufacture was approximately 2 cents, and the 98 cents earned from [[seignorage]] was applied to the [[National debt of the United States|national debt]].{{sfn|Reiter, 1981}}{{sfn|Julian, 1993|p=2932}} Had the coins been melted, their seignorage would have been added to the debt.{{sfn|Julian, 1993|p=2932}} Accordingly, the coins were placed in government storage, to be dispensed as needed.{{sfn|Reiter, 1981}}

The coin's design did have repercussions north of the border; when Canada introduced its [[Loonie|new one-dollar coin]] in 1987, its dimensions were made similar so that vending machine specifications could be common between the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lee |first=Robert |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=w78yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rO8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5946,2073094 |title=New coin to replace dollar bill |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=1986-03-25 |accessdate=2013-04-14 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Baltimore_Metro_Subway |Baltimore, Maryland Metro Subway]] opened in 1984, it used the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin as tokens with which to buy tickets.  It became the largest single user of Susan B. Anthony dollar coins in its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Valentine |first=Paul W. |title=Underground Coin |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1984/04/02/underground-coin/2ef50b92-4d55-4637-a8a6-195e4a6bf46c/ |website=Washington Post |date=2 April 1984 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116003524/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1984/04/02/underground-coin/2ef50b92-4d55-4637-a8a6-195e4a6bf46c/?utm_term=.5c1c876852b0 |archive-date=16 November 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Martha_Washington_dollar_pattern_obverse_NN.jpg|thumb|alt=The obverse of a coin depicting a woman dressed in eighteenth-century clothing|After passage of the United States $1 Coin Act of 1997, the Mint struck pattern coins, depicting [[Martha Washington]] and dated 1759, to test a more distinctive, gold-colored coin.]]

Despite their unpopularity in transactions, Anthony dollars saw heavy use in over 9,000 stamp-dispensing machines situated in [[United States Postal Service]] buildings across the country beginning in 1993. Additionally, the coins saw use with mass transit authorities.{{sfn|Roach, 2010|p=22}} Various propositions were discussed in Congress since the last dollars were produced in 1981, but no action was taken to issue a new coin until the Treasury's stores of Anthony dollars became depleted in the 1990s.{{sfn|Roach, 2010|p=22}} In February 1996, the vaults totaled approximately 229,500,000 coins, but that number was reduced to approximately 133,000,000 by the end of 1997.{{sfn|Roach, 2010|p=22}} Faced with the necessity of striking more Susan B. Anthony dollars to fill the demand, the Treasury supported legislation authorizing a new dollar coin that would not be confused with the quarter. Legislation authorizing a dollar coin in a gold-colored composition and with a plain edge was introduced to the House and Senate in 1997, where it eventually received approval with a provision calling for it to depict Native-American guide [[Sacagawea]].{{sfn|Roach, 2010|p=22}} On December 1, 1997, President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the 50 States Commemorative Coin Program Act into law. The Act, which authorized the creation of the [[50 State Quarters]] program, included a section entitled "United States $1 Coin Act of 1997".{{sfn|Public Law 105–124}} That section officially authorized what became the [[Sacagawea dollar]].{{sfn|Roach, 2010|pp=22–24}}

Following passage of the act, a series of test strikes depicting [[Martha Washington]] were carried out to test a variety of gold-colored metallic compositions.{{sfn|Gilkes, 2008|p=82}} Although the act provided for creation of the new coin, it also allowed for resumption of striking the Anthony design until production began on the gold-colored dollar.{{sfn|Public Law 105–124}} Nearing depletion of Treasury stores, on May 20, 1999, the U.S. Mint announced that production of the Susan B. Anthony dollar would resume.{{sfn|U.S. Mint, 1999}} In total, 41,368,000 Anthony dollars were struck for circulation dated 1999.{{sfn|Yeoman, 2008|p=225}} The design was officially retired in 2000, when the new Sacagawea dollar entered production.{{sfn|Yeoman, 2008|pp=225–226}}

== Collecting ==

As few Susan B. Anthony dollars circulated, many remain available in uncirculated condition and are worth little above face value.{{sfn|Krause, 1999|p=64}} However, some date and [[mint mark]] varieties are relatively valuable. The 1981 coins, having been issued only to collectors, are valued above the other circulation strikes in the series.{{sfn|Yeoman, 2008|pp=224–225}} In addition, a well-known variety of the 1979 circulation strikes on which the date appears nearer to the rim commands a higher price than the regular issue.{{sfn|Krause, 1999|pp=64–65}}

All dates of the dollar also exist in [[Proof coinage|proof]] finish. The 1999 coins were sold as standalone proof strikes, rather than as part of a larger proof set, as the 1979, 1980 and 1981 issues were offered.{{sfn|Schwager, 2014|p=61}} The 1999 proof was minted exclusively at the Philadelphia Mint, and bears a 'P' mint mark, while all other proof Anthony dollars were minted at San Francisco and bear the 'S' of that Mint.{{sfn|Yeoman, 2008|p=225}} Some 1979 and 1981 proofs bear a mint mark which was applied to the coinage dies with a different punch, causing them to have a more legible appearance. They are considered scarce and are valued considerably higher than normal proofs of the series.{{sfn|Yeoman, 2008|p=225}}

'''''Tales of Zorro''''' is a 2008 [[anthology]] of Zorro stories and is the first collection of original short fiction featuring [[pulp hero]] [[Zorro]], edited by [[Richard Dean Starr]] and published by [[Moonstone Books]] in 2008.  A second [[anthology]], ''[[More Tales of Zorro]]'', was published in 2011.

==Book Notes==

The stories in ''Tales of Zorro'' incorporate elements from the original Zorro incarnation by [[Johnston McCulley]] in ''[[The Curse of Capistrano]]''. It also contains many references to other versions of Zorro including the 1998 film ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]'', Walt Disney's ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' (starring [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]]), and the [[Zorro (1990 TV series)|New World Television series]], as well as [[Isabel Allende]]'s ''[[Zorro: A Novel]]'', among others.

Some stories, such as Peter David's "Colors Seen by Candlelight" incorporate famous historical figures into the story while others contain suggestions of the supernatural or are told from unconventional viewpoints, such as [[A. C. Crispin]] and [[Kathleen O'Malley]]'s story, "Tornado Warning", which is told through the eyes of Zorro's famous [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]] stallion, [[Tornado (horse)|Tornado]].

The collection also includes a young adult story, "The Feathered Cape" by [[Jan Adkins]], author of ''Young Zorro: The Iron Brand''.  Adkins is a young adult author and illustrator who was also a technical advisor for Allende's 2005 ''[[Zorro (novel)|Zorro]]''.

Richard Dean Starr contributed a story to the book, "Winds of Change" and also collaborated on [[Max Allan Collins]]' story, "Zorro and the Fate Worse Than Death".

''Tales of Zorro'' contains three important essays including a [[Introduction (essay)|introduction]] by [[Guy Williams, Jr.]] (with [[Matthew Baugh]]), a [[foreword]] by [[Zorro Productions, Inc.]] Senior Vice-President [[Sandra Curtis]], and an [[Afterword]] by [[Isabel Allende]].

'''Tapestry Folkdance Center''' is a non-profit dance venue in [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota, dedicated to [[folk dances]]. Founded in 1983, the organization inhabited rented spaces until 1999 when it purchased a permanent home on Minnehaha Avenue. Tapestry offers a variety of dances including [[swing dance|swing]], [[contra dance|contra]], [[Bollywood dance|Bollywood]], and [[Romani dance|Romani]].

==History==
Tapestry Folkdance Center was formed in 1983 by a group of dancers who had previously danced together at the Soltari Folkdance Emporium in the late 1970s. The group held folkdance lessons and gatherings in rented spaces throughout Minneapolis including their first in [[Dinkytown, Minneapolis|Dinkytown]] at the former Marshall University High School building. They began to dance at Sabathani Community Center in 1990. In November 1998, Tapestry's rent was scheduled to triple at Sabathani, forcing the organization to consider acquiring its own permanent space.&lt;ref name="joining hands"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harlow|first1=Tim|title=Joining Hands|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-68746527.html|accessdate=July 16, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=December 17, 1999|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Dagger''''' ({{lang-sr|Нож, Nož}}; which means ''Knife'') is a 1999 Serbian [[war film]] directed by [[Miroslav Lekić]]. The film was written by Miroslav Lekić, [[Slobodan Stanojević]] and Igor Bojović. The plot is based on [[Vuk Drašković]]'s novel of the same name.

The main motive of the film is the eventually disclosed nonsense of ethnic division in Bosnia, pointing out to the same historical origin of both opposed ethnic groups, Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims - Orthodox Christians and Sunni Muslims, respectively. Set in the 1960s and observed from the point of view of Alija Osmanović, a young Muslim medical student raised by a single mother, his entire family slaughtered and his baby brother kidnaped by Serbs in Second World War, as the aftermath of Jugovići (Christian) and Osmanovići (Muslim) violent family feud, he learns not only that Osmanovići were once but a branch of Jugovići family who converted to Islam during the Turkish rule, but that, unbeknownst to his mother, he himself was a baby taken from Jugovići, after the massacre of Jugovići on Christmas Eve in 1942. Both families now extinct, and Alia as the descendant of both, torn between two cultures and two identities, he struggles to maintain his inner peace, desperately searching for his long lost step-brother and fighting the prejudices against the love relationship he has with a Serbian colleague student.

Based on true events of World War II and being centered on the atrocious crimes committed to Serbs during World War II, and the particular families of Jugovići and Osmanovići.

In 1999, the film was screened at the 13th Montenegro Film Festival, and gained five featured awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmskifestivalhercegnovi.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=32&amp;Itemid=21|title=13. filmski festival|year=1999|work=Montenegro Film Festival|publisher=Freshidea|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="the dagger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monteroyalpictures.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=62&amp;lang=en|title=The Dagger|year=2011|work=Monte Royal|publisher=© Monte Royal Pictures International|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also earned the “Fipresci Award” for Directing, five acting awards in the Niš Film Festival and the “Crystal Star” at the Brussels Film Festival.&lt;ref name="the dagger" /&gt;

'''''The Expulsion of the Déisi''''' is a medieval [[Ireland|Irish]] narrative of the [[Cycles of the Kings]]. It dates approximately to the 8th century, but survives only in manuscripts of a much later date. It describes the fictional history of the [[Déisi]], a group that had gained political power in parts of Ireland during the Early Middle Ages. Part of the text's purpose is to provide the kings of the Déisi – historically the descendants of unlanded [[vassal]]s to other tribes – with a mythical noble origin as the heirs to a dynasty expelled from [[Hill of Tara|Tara]].

The story survives in two different [[Old Irish]] versions, which contain essentially the same narrative supplemented by singular additions, including tangential episodes, lists of names, and poetry. After violently recovering his niece from the depredations of the king's son of Tara, [[Óengus Gaíbúaibthech]] and his followers are dispossessed by the king and sent to wander Ireland. They tarry in [[Leinster]] for a period, but are eventually expelled from that kingdom as well.  When military prowess fails them, they are able to forge a home for themselves through cunning and magic in [[Munster]] against the [[Kingdom of Ossory|Osraige]]. As with much early Irish literature, the digressive [[onomastics|onomastic]] and genealogical material is of great value. In particular, one passage describes a Déisi branch settling in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and founding the [[Kingdom of Dyfed]], a matter of some interest in the context of early Irish migrations to Britain.

==Versions and manuscripts==
The story survives in an earlier and a later version, which [[Kuno Meyer]] dubbed "A" and "B".&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt; The A version dates to the 8th century, but exists only in manuscripts of a significantly later date.&lt;ref name=Meyer102&gt;Meyer, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; It survives complete in Laud MS 610 and [[Rawlinson B 502|Rawlinson MS 502]], and in fragmentary form in the [[Book of Uí Maine]] and the Liber Flavus Fergusiorum.&lt;ref name=Meyer102/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hull 1954, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the complete copies, Meyer notes that the Rawlinson text contains fewer errors, but that Laud preserves more archaic spelling.&lt;ref name=Meyer102/&gt; The B version survives in some form in three manuscripts. The oldest of these is a fragment contained in the [[Book of the Dun Cow]]; this copy is complemented by the later two, found in H. 3. 17 and H. 2. 5, allowing for reconstruction of the text.&lt;ref name=Meyer103&gt;Meyer, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The H. 2. 5 copy further contains several poems absent from the other manuscripts.

The title is recorded variously in the manuscripts. Rawlinson contains ''Tairired na n'Déssi'', or ''The Journeying of the Déisi.''&lt;ref name=Meyernote&gt;Meyer, p. 102 and notes.&lt;/ref&gt; Laud records it as ''De causis torche n'Déssi''/''acuis toirge na n'Déssi''. The word ''torche/toirge'' is obscure, but Meyer associates it with "expedition".&lt;ref name=Meyernote/&gt; The B manuscripts all contain some reference to the injury visited upon [[Cormac mac Airt]], one of the characters: the Book of the Dun Cow has ''Tucait innarba na n'Dési im Mumain &amp; aided Cormaic'', H. 3. 17 has ''Cóechad Cormaic i Temraig'', and H. 2. 5 has ''Tucaid cháetcha Cormaic do Aengus Gaibuaibtheach &amp; aigeag Ceallaig &amp; fotha indarbtha na nDeissi do Muig Breag''.&lt;ref name=Meyer103/&gt; [[Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville]]'s ''Catalogue'' further lists two possibly related titles: ''Longes Eithne Uathaige'' and ''Tochomlad na nDési a Temraig''.&lt;ref&gt;d'Arbois de Jubainville, p. 171, 263.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unknown to which version, if either, these refer.&lt;ref name=Meyer103/&gt;

==Background==
{{main article|Déisi}}
The term ''[[Déisi]]'' initially designated various subject peoples owing tribute to landowning tribes. It derives from the [[Old Irish]] ''déis'', meaning "client(s)" or "vassalry"; this distinguishes it from other Irish ethonyms that derive from ancestors' personal names.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Expulsion of the Déisi'' concerns one such group, the [[Déisi Muman]] of [[Kingdom of Munster|Munster]], who lived primarily in the present-day counties of [[County Waterford|Waterford]] and [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] and were subject to the [[Eóganachta]] dynasty. Over time, the Déisi Muman grew in power, and were prominent enough to found their own local kingdom at a fairly early date. The various groups designated ''Déisi'' were not originally closely related, but by the mid-8th century, following the rise of the Déisi Muman, they came to be seen as a genealogically linked whole, descended from the same noble ancestors. ''The Explulsion of the Déisi'' gives a mythical origin narrative for the then powerful Déisi Muman and associated groups.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, pp. 121–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Expulsion of the Déisi'' was long considered a more or less historically accurate account of a mass displacement of the Déisi and their subsequent settlement on the southwestern coast of Ireland and elsewhere. This was later disputed by scholars such as [[Eoin MacNeill|John MacNeill]], [[Patrick C. Power]], [[T. F. O'Rahilly]], and Séamus Pender, who regard it as late fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Hull 1959, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrative==
Both versions describe the adventures of the Déisi forefathers in the time of [[Cormac mac Airt]], [[King of Tara]]. They follow the same narrative track, but both contain sections that break from the main narrative and tell individual, largely unrelated stories about the Déisi and their contemporaries. A contains episodes not in B, and vice versa.

===A version===
In the A version, the Déisi are led by the four sons of Artchorp: Brecc, [[Óengus Gaíbúaibthech]] (Óengus of the Dread Spear), Eochaid Allmuir (Eochaid the Foreigner), and Forad. Forad's daughter Forach is raped and kidnapped by Conn (elsewhere Cellach), the "wanton son" of Cormac maic Airt. Óengus, who leads a band of fifty men, goes to [[Hill of Tara|Tara]] to rescue her. When Conn refuses to release the girl, Óengus runs him through with his "dread spear", which blinds Cormac in one eye in the process. Because the law forbids a high king to have a physical blemish, Cormac must retire to a [[ráth]] outside Tara, and defer the kingship to his son [[Cairbre Lifechair]]. Undeterred, Cormac raises his forces against the Déisi and expels them from Tara. Óengus, together with his brother Brecc's sons Russ and Eogan, engages the king in seven battles. After forty days Óengus succeeds Brecc as king of the Déisi, but steps down due to "murmurs" about his consolidation of the power of both champion and king. Cormac will not give the Déisi a fair fight, and pushes them into [[Leinster]], where the local ruler Fiachu Bacceda drives the [[Uí Bairrche]] from their land and gives it to the Déisi. They remain there for three decades.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, pp. 104–109 (sect. 1–6).&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually the Uí Bairrche warrior Eochu Guinech ejects the Déisi and they are compelled to move further south into Ard Ladrann, thereafter known as the "Land of the Wandering Host". Section 8 tells the story of Ethne the Dread, daughter of then King of Leinster [[Crimthann mac Énnai]] (d. 483) and an eventual fosterling of the Déisi. At her birth a [[druid]] prophesies that under Ethne her mother's kindred will seize what will be their homeland; hearing this her parents feed her the flesh of young boys to accelerate her growth. Meanwhile, Cormac continues to harass Óengus and the Déisi, stirring up discord among their warriors and leaders. He sends a peace offer to Russ and Eogan, the sons of Brecc, offering them absolution and land if they return to his service. Óengus promises them yet more land and preeminence over his children for them to remain.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, pp. 108–115 (sect. 7–12).&lt;/ref&gt;

When Crimthann mac Énnai dies, his sons turn on the Déisi, driving them out of Leinster altogether. They settle briefly in [[Kingdom of Osraige|Osraige]], but the king burns down their houses, leaving them homeless and forced to wander west into [[Munster]]. They receive some relief when [[Óengus mac Nad Froích]] (d. 489), King of Munster, proposes to marry Ethne the Dread, who has been traveling with the Déisi. He offers to grant her any three demands as the dowry. Ethne requests land for her mother's kindred, fulfilling her prophecy; she also requests that Osraige be cleared of its inhabitants and given to the Déisi, and that her people be as free as the "three [[Eóganachta|Eoganacht]] of Munster". Óengus grants her wishes, but the Déisi are unable to oust the residents of Osraige. With the help of Lugaid Laigde Cosc, the seer-judge of the [[Corcu Loígde]] and [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]], they devise a trick: learning of a prophecy that whichever side draws first blood the next day will be routed, the Déisi druids transform one of their men into a red cow. The men of Osraige kill the cow, thereby sealing their fate; they are pushed across the Lingaun River, which thereafter serves as the border between the Déisi and Osraige. The Déisi divide up their land, and most of the remainder of the text lists names of individual Déisi and [[sept]]s descended from them.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, pp. 114–131 (sect. 13–23).&lt;/ref&gt;

===B version===

The B version contains the same basic narrative, with significant additions and subtractions. It was edited (Irish only) by Meyer in ''Anecdd.'' I,&lt;ref&gt;Kuno Meyer, ed., ''Tucait indarba na nD&amp;eacute;ssi'' (Expulsion of the Déssi), in ''Anecdota from Irish Manuscripts'', vol. i. (1907), [https://books.google.com/books?id=mdUfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA15 pp.15-24]&lt;/ref&gt; with TCD MS 1316 (olim H. 2.15a), pp.&amp;nbsp;67a-68b (''H'' text) as base, with footnoted readings from MS 1336 (olim H. 3.17), col. 720b-723a (''h'' text).

It likewise begins with the kidnapping of Forach by Cormac's son (here Cellach), but in this version Óengus is initially too busy avenging family insults with his famous spear to save her. It is only after he is rebuked for his dithering by a woman – whom he kills – that he rescues Forach, killing Cellach and blinding Cormac in the process. The story continues with the Déisi's expulsion from Tara, their sojourn in Leinster, and their patriation in Munster following the marriage arrangement between Ethne the Dread and Óengus mac Nad Froích. Here, however, aid in exploiting the prophecy that ultimately allows them to displace the men of Osraige comes not from a seer-judge, but from the "haughty daughter" of the Osraige druid who delivers the prognostication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/dessi2.html ''This Is The Cause Of The Expulsion Of The Déssi To Munster And The Violent Death Of Cormac'', sect. 1–15.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the material not in the A version, by far the most substantial is in a lengthy tangential episode dealing with the birth and childhood of Óengus' foster son Corc Duibne, progenitor of the [[Corcu Duibne]], whose name is merely mentioned in A. Corc and his brother are born of incest to Coirpre Múse and Duihind, children of the king of Munster [[Conaire Cóem]], and their nativity brings famine to the land. The people want them immolated, but Corc is saved by a druid and his wife who take him to an offshore island so that his curse is removed from Ireland. The druid's wife, Boí, performs purification rituals that ultimately transfer Corc's curse to an otherworldy white cow, allowing him to return to his family. Eventually he serves as hostage in Cormac mac Airt's court, where he is fostered by Óengus; he accompanies his foster father when he is expelled from Tara. He tries to convince the wandering Déisi to settle on the island of his rearing, and stays there when the Déisi opt to move on to Cashel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/dessi2.html ''This Is The Cause Of The Expulsion Of The Déssi To Munster And The Violent Death Of Cormac'', sect. 1–12.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The variant text MS 1336 (olim H. 3.17) occurs with the different title, ''Cóecad Cormaic i Temraig'' (Blinding of Cormac at Tara); and this text is also postscripted by a tract which alleges that the Crimall, the spear in the age of Cormac, was also the same weapon as the [[Lúin of Celtchar]] and the spear of [[Lugh]].&lt;ref&gt;Arbois de Jubainville, ''Essai d'un catalogue'', p.90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dyfed==
Section 11 of A describes Eochaid son of Artchorp traveling oversea with his descendants and settling in ''Demed'' ([[Demetia]], later known as [[Kingdom of Dyfed|Dyfed]] in [[Wales]]). From Eochaid and his descendants springs the line of kings of Dyfed, whose descent is given down to "Tualodor mac Rígin" (Tudor map Regin).&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; This genealogy has much correspondence with pedigrees in Welsh sources, namely the [[Harleian genealogies]] and the later [[genealogies from Jesus College MS 20]]. The Harleian records show the same names from Tudor back to the figure Triphun, given in ''Expulsion'' as Eochaid's great-grandson. However, Harleian gives an entirely different pedigree for Triphun himself, tracing his descent back to the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kmatthews.org.uk/history/harleian_genealogies/2.html Harleian genealogy 2].&lt;/ref&gt; This could be an attempt by later genealogists to give a more illustrious pedigree to Dyfed's kingly line, or possibly to obscure its Irish origins. However, it could be that Harleian preserves the older and more accurate version, and that the ''Expulsion'' version is a later textual corruption.

Regardless, there is indeed evidence of early Irish presence in Dyfed and elsewhere in Britain. [[Ogham]] inscriptions in an early form of [[Irish language|Irish]] have been found in [[Pembrokeshire]] and [[Carmarthenshire]].&lt;ref name=TCW163&gt;Charles-Williams, p. 163 and notes.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, later literary sources from both sides of the [[Irish Sea]] discuss the presence of southern Irish peoples in Britain. The 9th-century ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', for instance, refers to the [[Uí Liatháin]] being active in Dyfed until they were pushed out by [[Cunedda]] and his sons (fl. mid-5th century).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:History of the Britons#1:14|''Historia Brittonum'', ch. 14]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cormac's Glossary]]'' also mentions the oversea exploits of the Uí Liatháin, but locates their fortress in [[Cornwall]] rather than Dyfed.&lt;ref name=TCW163/&gt; However, only ''The Expulsion of the Déisi'' attests a specifically Déisi presence. [[Eoin MacNeill]], who treats the literary accounts as largely historical, suggests that a Déisi settlement in Dyfed could have existed as a subordinate unit to a larger Uí Liatháin-led colony until the latter was expelled under Cunedda.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeill, pp. 128–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Four Apostles''''' is a [[panel painting]] by the German [[Renaissance]] master [[Albrecht Dürer]]. It was finished in 1526, and is the last of his large works. It depicts the four apostles larger-than-life-size.  The Bavarian  [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Elector Maximilian I]] obtained ''The Four Apostles'' in the year 1627 due to pressure on the Nuremberg city fathers.  Since then, the painting has been in [[Munich]] and, despite all the efforts of Nuremberg since 1806, it has not been returned.

==Description==
{{external media | width = 210px | headerimage = [[File:Albrecht Dürer - The Four Holy Men (detail) - WGA07027.jpg|210px]] | align = right | video1 =[http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/durer-four-apostles.html Smarthistory - Dürer's ''The Four Apostles'']}}
When Dürer moved back to [[Nuremberg]] he produced many famous paintings there, including several self-portraits. He gave ''The Four Apostles'' to the town council.  Saints John and Peter appear in the left panel; the figures in the right panel are Saints Mark and Paul. Mark and Paul both hold Bibles, and John and Peter are shown reading from the opening page of John's own Gospel.  At the bottom of each panel, quotations from the Bible are inscribed.&lt;ref name=smart&gt;
{{cite web | title =Dürer's Four Apostles | work = | publisher =Smarthistory at Khan Academy | date = | url =http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/durer-four-apostles.html | accessdate =December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apostles are recognizable by their symbols:
*St. John the Evangelist: open book
*St. Peter: keys
*St. Mark: scroll
*St. Paul: sword and closed book

They are also associated with the [[four temperaments]].
*St. John: sanguine
*St. Peter: phlegmatic
*St. Mark: choleric
*St. Paul: melancholy

==Historical context==
''The Four Apostles'' was created during the Reformation, begun in 1517 and having the largest initial impact on Germany. As it was a Protestant belief that icons were contradictory to the Word of God, which was held in the utmost supremacy over Protestant ideas, the Protestant church was not a patron of any sacred art. Therefore, any Protestant artist, like Dürer became, had to commission their own works. Many aspects of the image depicted prove significant in light of the Reformation itself.&lt;ref name=smart/&gt;

'''The Juice Media''' ('''TJM''') is an Australian film and media company, that produces contemporary political and social satire. They are known for their Internet series Honest Government Ads and Juice Rap News.

TJM has been at the centre of a number of political controversies including the use of the "Australien" logo that is at the heart of a Bill to change the Australian Criminal Code Act as well as the divisive Australia Day piracy video.

== History ==

TJM was founded by [[Giordano Nanni]], an Australian [[historian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person194914|title=DR GIORDANO NANNI - The University of Melbourne|date=2012-09-11|access-date=2018-06-11|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911052814/https://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person194914|archivedate=11 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[author]], [[Satire|satirist]] and [[Video production|video producer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://logancij.com/speaker/giordano/|title=Giordano Nanni|work=The Logan CIJ Symposium|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; TJM started publishing on [[YouTube|YouTube]] in May 2008 with the first episode of [[Juice Rap News]] premiering on 4 October 2009.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKRw8GAAtm27q4R3Q0kst_g|title=thejuicemedia|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 May 2016 Juice Media launched the Honest Government ad series with Visit Australia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thejuicemedia.com/about/|title=About - The Juice Media|work=The Juice Media|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 2017 TJM released the controversial ''Australia Day'' (Piracy parody).

== Controversy ==

=== Australien Coat of Harms ===
[[File:Australien Govt - Coat of Harms - by THEJUICEMEDIA.png|thumb|Australien Coat of Harms as created by The Juice Media]]The Australien Coat of Harms was created as the backdrop to the fictitious Department of Genuine Satire for the Honest Government Adverts. There are a number of notable differences between the fictitious Coat of Harms and the [[Coat of arms of Australia|Commonwealth Coat of Arms]] that it lampoons including:

* A stylised alien head replacing the Commonwealth star
* The heads of the emu and kangaroo have been replaced with surveillance cameras
* The bar under the star has been replaced with a buffering bar
* The 6 state emblems on the shield have been replaced with a pirate ship
* The "Australia" wording under the shield has been replaced with "Not the Real Logo"

In September 2017 TJM received an e-mail from the Australian National Symbols Officer requesting that the use of the satirical logo no longer be used as they had received complaints from the members of the public about the logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/thejuicemedia/status/906104236789841920/photo/1|title=theJuice on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally 5 days later a Bill was proposed to [[Parliament of Australia|Australian parliament]] to amend the [[Criminal law of Australia|Criminal Code Act 1995]].

The summary for the Bill was stated as:&lt;blockquote&gt;Amends the Criminal Code Act 1995 to: introduce new offences for a person recklessly or intentionally representing themselves to be, or to be acting on behalf of, or with the authority of, a Commonwealth entity or service; and introduce a new injunction power to allow authorised persons to seek injunctive relief to prevent a person from engaging in conduct in contravention of the new offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5973|title=Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|last=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House|first=Canberra|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The case for the amendments to the Bill were presented in the Senate by the [[Attorney general|Attorney-General]] [[The Honourable|Hon.]] [[George Brandis]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]]&lt;ref name="thejuicemedia"&gt;{{Citation|last=thejuicemedia|title=George Brandis on Genuine Satire|date=2017-11-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLzPuNL0BKU|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were a number of public submissions to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee overseeing the proposed amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Legal_and_Constitutional_Affairs/ImpersonatingaCommBody/Submissions|title=Submissions|last=7111;|first=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House, Canberra, ACT, 2600; contact=+61 2 6277|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the submissions were pieces from [[Australian Lawyers for Human Rights]] and [[Electronic Frontiers Australia]] both of which expressed concerns with the Bill with regards to freedom of speech and lack of safeguards and ambiguous wording in the Bill that could result in legal action being taken against critics and satirists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=310dc8e6-72ba-4760-9f6e-4ac8ae2a2147&amp;subId=561090|title=Australian Lawyers for Human Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=Parliament of Australia|access-date=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/australian-government-wants-give-satire-boot|title=Australian Government Wants to Give Satire The Boot|last=Nazer|first=Daniel|date=2017-10-20|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://alhr.org.au/2017-alhr-human-rights-report-card/|title=2017 ALHR Human Rights Report Card - ALHR|date=2018-01-11|work=ALHR|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''It is unfortunate that the Australian government cannot distinguish between impersonation and satire. But it is especially worrying because the government has proposed legislation that would impose jail terms for impersonation of a government agency. Some laws against impersonating government officials can be appropriate (Australia, like the U.S., is seeing telephone scams from fraudsters claiming to be tax officials). But the proposed legislation in Australia lacks sufficient safeguards. Moreover, the recent letter to Juice Media shows that the government may lack the judgment needed to apply the law fairly.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171023/07223238458/australian-lawmakers-propose-outlawing-parody-having-sense-humor.shtml|title=Australian Lawmakers Propose Outlawing Parody, Having A Sense Of Humor|work=Techdirt.|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This was a sentiment echoed by [[Adam Bandt|Adam Bandt]] [[Member of parliament|MP]] in a speech to parliament in which he addressed the topics of freedom of speech and the rights to "mercilessly troll government".&lt;ref name="thejuicemedia"/&gt;

[[Nick McKim|Senator Nick McKim]] is on record as saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;"''Where does this leave satire in Australia? Does it mean that figures such as [[Shaun Micallef]], The Juice Media and [[The Chaser]] team, as well as upcoming comedians, will have to think twice before they crack jokes lest they find themselves on the stand or in the slammer?

=== Australia Day (Piracy Parody) ===
On 24 January 2017 TJM released a [[parody]] of a well known [[Copy protection|anti-piracy]] ad, colloquially dubbed "[[You Wouldn't Steal a Car]]", called Australia Day (Piracy parody).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=thejuicemedia|title=Australia Day (Piracy parody)|date=2017-01-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UytdM-x3cv4|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video compared the celebration of [[Australia Day]] (Jan 26), which marks the arrival of the [[First Fleet]],  to a number of infamous events in history. The events depicted include [[Nazism|Nazi's]] "[[Final Solution]]", dropping of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb on Hiroshima]] and [[September 11 attacks|Sep 11 attacks on the Twin Towers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4158072/Ad-compares-Australia-Day-September-11.html?ito=social-twitter_DailyMailAU|title=Ad compares Australia Day to celebrating September 11|last=|first=|date=|work=UK Daily Mail|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lanesainty/this-video-compares-the-settling-of-australia-to-911-hiroshi|title=This Video Compares Australian Settlement To 9/11, Hiroshima And The Holocaust|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video was released as part of the Change the Date campaign (#[[changethedate]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2018/01-02/australia-dystopia/|title=Australia Dystopia|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; which calls for changing the date of Australia Day by [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]], [[Torres Strait Islands|Torres Straight]] Islander and wider community groups.&lt;blockquote&gt;''Many believe celebrating on January 26 is insensitive as the arrival of the First Fleet marked the beginning of a brutal history which saw mass killings of Indigenous Australians.''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-25/invasion-day-video-compares-australia-day-to-september-11/8211630?pfmredir=sm|title='You wouldn't celebrate September 11': Ad compares Australia Day to tragic world events|date=2017-01-25|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This video incited a great deal of debate, especially in social media, with a lot of negative sentiments expressed especially at the comparison of Jan 26 to other historical dates:&lt;blockquote&gt;"I understand the sentiment, but these are really poor examples. Not one of these events resulted in the creation of a sustainable society/civilisation," Shaun Fielding said.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The [[National Australia Day Council]] said in response:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Though 26 January marks this specific event, today Australia Day celebrations reflect contemporary Australia: our diverse society and landscape, our remarkable achievements and our bright future. It also is an opportunity to reflect on our nation's history, and to consider how we can make Australia an even better place in future," &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2017 the Australia Day celebrations in [[Fremantle]], [[Western Australia]] were cancelled and replaced with more culturally inclusive celebrations 2 days later on Jan 28. This was seen as a litmus test for the #changethedate movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-24/fremantle-divided-over-cancellation-of-australia-day-festivities/8207954|title='An act of betrayal': City divided over Australia Day cancellation|date=2017-01-24|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Three Ages of Woman''''' is a painting by [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist painter]] and one of the most prominent members of the [[Vienna Secession]] movement. that was completed in Austria in 1905.

==Description ==
The work features three women in varying stages of age, symbolizing the cycle of life. The three women are central on the canvas and are the focal point of the work. The background has a lack of depth, making it look very two dimensional. The colors are neutral and create a restful effect.&lt;ref&gt;Eisler, Gustav Klimt,33.&lt;/ref&gt; Klimt's common use of colorful motifs is also evident in this work. There are two vertical auras that the women are in. The two younger women are in a blue aura that has a fluid pattern of cool colors. The old woman is in an aura by herself, and it is filled with a less fluid pattern with more distinct separations in the design. The colors of this aura are warm, earthy tones that contrast with the cool colors of the other aura. The woman and the auras overlap slightly. The leg of the young woman goes behind the left aura and the old woman's head comes in front of the right aura.

The youngest figure, a child, is connected to the young woman who is her mother. They are the only two touching, they also have sheer blue fabric draped down their legs. Both of these women also have their eyes closed. The young woman has flowers around her head which represent spring.&lt;ref&gt;Eisler, Gustav Klimt, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Her hair is bright an voluminous, contrasting with that of the old woman who is separated from the other two women. Her head is turned away and facing down. The effects of old age are obvious through her sagging skin, bloated belly, and prominent veins. She is also unlike the other two in the fact that both of her feet are shown. This was done so the viewer can see the ugliness of her age in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;Eisler, Gustav Klimt, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Klimt, and the Vienna Secession==
The artist, [[Gustav Klimt]], was a prominent Austrian painter who was born in 1862. He worked as an apprentice of Ferdinand Laufberger during the early part of his art career. Later he was a founding member and the first president of the [[Vienna Secession]] from 1897 to 1903. He and fellow artist formed the secession after leaving  Künstlerhaus, or the Corporation of Austrian Artists due to differences in views. The Secession held many exhibitions and also founded a magazine titled [[Ver Sacrum]], which translates as sacred spring. Here they published many writers and artists all while sharing the views of the Vienna Secession. Klimt left the Vienna Secession in 1905, the same year that ''The Three Ages of Woman'' was completed.&lt;ref name="oxfordartonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com|title=Home Page in Oxford Art Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical elements==
This is an oil on canvas painting that measures 180 by 180 centimeters. It shows signs of an impasto painting technique that was common of Klimt's work. His painting methods included mixing drying solvents into the paint to make sure there was no unwanted glossy appearance. He also would retouch works, which limited how many paintings he was able to create per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com|title=Home Page in Oxford Art Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Three Ages of Woman'' falls into Klimt's Golden Period which includes other works such as ''[[The Kiss (Klimt painting)|The Kiss]]''. This period was characterized by high ornamentation and the use of gold and metallic paints.&lt;ref name="oxfordartonline.com"/&gt; This work also suggest that it is part of the Art Nouveau movement due to the time period and the decorative elements. The Painting is located in Rome at the [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna]].&lt;ref name="oxfordartonline.com"/&gt;

'''''This Is Gonna Hurt''''' is the second [[studio album]] by [[Sixx:A.M.]], a side project of [[Mötley Crüe]] bassist [[Nikki Sixx]], released on May 3, 2011. Like the first album which served as a companion soundtrack to [[Nikki Sixx]]' first book ''[[The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star]]'', this album is a companion to the book of the same name, Sixx's second book, which was released on April 12, 2011. However, unlike its predecessor, this album does not contain any spoken word. [[Walmart]] refused to stock the album in stores because of the album's cover art, which features a heart with nails through it.

A [[locomotive]] or [[train]] can play many roles in art, for example:
* As a [[work of art]] in itself in addition to most functional considerations, especially in [[Streamliner|streamlined]] steam locomotives and luxury passenger accommodations of the early 20th century, known also as the [[Machine Age]]
* As a subject for a [[:Category:Rail transport in fiction|novel]] or [[:Category:Rail transport films|film]]
* As a [[metaphor]] in song or poetry, particularly for [[Power (physics)|physical power]] or directed movement (physical, ''romantic'' or other), as in ''[[Fisherman's Blues]]'':&lt;!--This should be short enough to qualify as fair use --&gt;
::"I wish I was the brakeman
::on a hurtling, fevered train
::crashing headlong into the heartland
::like a cannon in the rain"

In 1978, the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in [[Paris]] held the [[art exhibition|exhibition]] "[[Les Temps des Gares]]" with the [[Palais des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Brussels]], the [[National Railway Museum]] in [[York]], and the [[Leonardo da Vinci Museum of Science and Technology]] in [[Milan]]. 

In 2008, [[Liverpool]]'s [[Walker Art Gallery]] held an exhibition entitled: "Art in the Age of Steam."

'''''Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson''''' is a [[song cycle]] for medium voice and piano by the American composer [[Aaron Copland]].

Completed in 1950 and lasting for just under half an hour, it represents Copland's longest work for solo voice.&lt;ref&gt;Copland A. and Perlis, V. (1989) ''Copland Since 1943'', p. 159. New York: St Martins's Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He assigned the first line of each poem as the song title, [[Emily Dickinson]] having not titled any of the pieces. The exception is "The Chariot", which was Dickinson's original published title.

Each song is dedicated to a composer friend. The sequence, with dedicatees, is:

# Nature, the Gentlest Mother ([[David Diamond (composer)|David Diamond]])
#There Came a Wind Like a Bugle ([[Elliott Carter]])
#Why Do They Shut Me Out of Heaven? ([[Ingolf Dahl]])
#The World Feels Dusty ([[Alexei Haieff]])
#Heart, We Will Forget Him! ([[Marcelle de Manziarly]])
#Dear March, Come In! ([[Juan Orrego-Salas]])
#Sleep Is Supposed to Be ([[Irving Fine]])
#When They Come Back ([[Harold Shapero]])
#I Felt a Funeral in My Brain ([[Camargo Guarnieri]])
#I've Heard an Organ Talk Sometimes ([[Alberto Ginastera]])
#Going to Heaven! ([[Lukas Foss]])
#[[Because I could not stop for Death|The Chariot]] ([[Arthur Berger (composer)|Arthur Berger]])

Copland himself acknowledged that many have heard the influence of [[Charles Ives]], [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Gabriel Fauré]] in the songs. In his own memoirs he made the link between Dickinson's and Mahler's preoccupation with death, however he stated that he recognized no direct musical influence.&lt;ref&gt;Copland and Perlis (1989) {{pn|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, writers have frequently cited the fifth song in particular, "Heart, We Will Forget Him!" as being Copland at his most Mahlerian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boosey.com/licensing/music/Aaron-Copland-Twelve-Poems-of-Emily-Dickinson/6814|title=Aaron Copland – ''Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson''|publisher=Boosey &amp; Hawkes|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is perhaps even more evident the orchestral setting, which he began in 1958. Completed in 1970, '''''Eight Poems of Emily Dickinson''''' for small orchestra omits 2, 8, 9 and 10 from the original sequence. 

The original version was premiered at [[Columbia University]] on 18 May 1950, with soloist [[Alice Howland]] accompanied by the composer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shirleymohr.com/JHU/Sample_Articles_JHUP/EDJ_2003_12_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was not especially well-received by critics, prompting Copland to note wryly to [[Leonard Bernstein]], "that I decided I must have written a better cycle than I had realized."&lt;ref name="cso.org"&gt;https://cso.org/uploadedFiles/1_Tickets_and_Events/Program_Notes/031110_ProgramNotes_Copland_Emily.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The premiere of the orchestration was given on 14 November 1970 at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York City, with soloist [[Gwendolyn Killebrew]] and the [[Juilliard Orchestra]] conducted by [[Michael Tilson Thomas]].&lt;ref name="cso.org"/&gt; Tilson Thomas subsequently recorded the cycle for [[EMI Classics|EMI]] with [[Barbara Hendricks]] and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]].

Both versions have been recorded many times since their respective premieres.

'''UMKC Theatre''' is a graduate and undergraduate [[academic department]] of the [[University of Missouri-Kansas City]] (UMKC) that provides both educational and professional training in multiple areas of theatrical production, including [[acting]], [[scenic design]], [[lighting design]], [[costume design]], [[sound design]], [[dramaturgy]] and historical research, [[playwriting]], and [[stage management]],&lt;ref&gt;The University of Missouri-Kansas City. "2013-2014 UMKC Catalog, College of Arts and Sciences, Theatre."&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains a strong connection with the [[Kansas City Repertory Theatre]] (KCRT), the leading regional theatre in the [[Kansas City]] area.&lt;ref&gt;The Kansas City Repertory Theatre.

==History==

Theatrical production at the University of Missouri-Kansas City began almost immediately after the institution was founded as the [[University of Kansas City]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Felicia Hardison Londré. "A Brief History of the UMKC Department of Theatre." Archived within the Patricia McIlrath Center for Mid-American Theatre, University of Missouri-Kansas City, 4949 Cherry Street, Kansas City, MO, 64110, Room 408. Accessed 10/1/2013&lt;/ref&gt; The first play produced on the university campus was [[Rachel Crothers]]' ''Mary the Third'' in the summer of 1934, followed by [[Sophocles]]' classic tragedy ''Antigone'' in the winter of that same year.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond R. Gould. "Department of Theatre, University of Missouri in Kansas City, A History of Productions." pg. 1. Located within the Patricia McIlrath Center for Mid-American Theatre, University of Missouri-Kansas City, 4949 Cherry Street, Kansas City, MO, 64110, Room 408. Accessed 10/1/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, a permanent theatre structure was constructed on campus by adapting an abandoned camp theatre building left over from a deactivated [[United States Air Force]] base, and Dr. John Newfield was hired to serve as the first professional director of the new University Playhouse. A former director of theatre and opera whose work had been produced throughout New York City and Europe, Newfield inaugurated the university's first [[Master of Arts]] degree in Theatre as a component of its Department of English upon his arrival.&lt;ref&gt;Felicia Hardison Londré. "A Brief History of the UMKC Department of Theatre." Archived within the Patricia McIlrath Center for Mid-American Theatre, University of Missouri-Kansas City, 4949 Cherry Street, Kansas City, MO, 64110, Room 408. Accessed 10/1/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was not until the university hired Dr. [[Patricia McIlrath]] in 1954 as Newfield's replacement that an academic department sovereign from the Department of English was established to take on the dual responsibility of producing theatre on campus and training students in the history and methodology of theatrical production.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Lapham. "The Woman Behind Missouri Repertory Theatre." ''The Kansas City Star Magazine.'' June, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially serving as chair of the Department of Speech, McIlrath was selected to lead a newly formed Department of Speech and Theatre after the private University of Kansas City was inducted into the public University of Missouri system in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond R. Gould. "Department of Theatre, University of Missouri in Kansas City, A History of Productions." pg. 34.

Accessed 10/1/2013&lt;/ref&gt; As the head of UMKC Theatre, McIlrath played a paramount role in the development of [[Regional theater in the United States|regional theatre]] in the Kansas City area, founding the UMKC Summer Repertory Theatre in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;"Repertory Team is Recruited by U.

Following McIlrath's retirement as Founding Chair of the UMKC Theatre in 1984 and Founding Artistic Director of the Missouri Repertory Theatre in 1985, the responsibilities of leading the academic department of UMKC Theatre and of directing the professional company of Missouri Repertory Theatre (Kansas City Repertory Theatre) were separated, but the two institutions remain closely linked to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Felicia Hardison Londré.

Since its establishment in the 1960s, the department has had numerous alumni go on to find success in the fields of stage, film, and television. In addition, numerous professional theatres in modern-day Kansas City were founded by former students or employees of UMKC Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Rebekah Presson. "An Atmosphere of Genius."

Accessed online at http://www.kcrep.org/about/Spencer/ on 10/3/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; UMKC Theatre also regularly stages productions in Studio 116, a blackbox performance space located within same building. With a training mission of serving as a teaching hospital for the theatre, UMKC Theatre frequently engages in co-productions with various professional theatre companies throughout the Kansas City area, including the Kansas City Repertory Theatre, the Unicorn Theatre, the Coterie Theatre, and [[Kansas City Actors Theatre]], and has presented theatrical works at multiple off-campus venues in recent years, such as the City Stage Theatre in [[Union Station (Kansas City)]] and the J.C. Nichols Theatre at the [[National World War I Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Trussel. "Theatre, museum become allies for 'Billy Bishop'." ''The Kansas City Star.'' Feb. 8, 2012.

==Degrees Offered==

The UMKC Theatre offers degrees at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Its [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree program in Theatre focuses on providing undergraduate students with a broad educational experience that includes all aspects of theatrical production, but allows students to select a specific field of emphasis, such as performance or design. In the early 1980s, the University of Missouri-Kansas City was granted the authority to offer the only [[Master of Fine Arts]] degrees in theatre in the State of Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;Felicia Hardison Londré.

Accessed 10/1/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Terminal MFA degrees are available to graduate students seeking to obtain professional educations in acting, costume design, lighting design, scenic design, sound design, stage management, or technical direction. In addition, the department offers a Master of Arts degree with an emphasis in either playwriting or in theatre history and dramatic literature to graduate students interested in either a literary or research-oriented education in the theatre arts, and in obtaining practical experience in dramaturgy.&lt;ref&gt;"2013-2014 UMKC Catalog, College of Arts and Sciences, Theatre."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zoomorphic architecture''' is the practice of using animal forms as the inspirational basis and blueprint for architectural design.  "While animal forms have always played a role adding some of the deepest layers of meaning in architecture, it is now becoming evident that a new strand of [[biomorphism]] is emerging where the meaning derives not from any specific representation but from a more general allusion to biological processes."&lt;ref name="zoomorphic" /&gt;

The practice is said by some to be a reaction against some of the modern schools of architecture, such as [[Modernism]] and their apparent opposition to nature and organic form.  Commenting on the movement away from these rigid and artificial design trends, Susannah Hagan, in her book ''Taking Shape'', has this to say: "The oppositions between culture and nature, so importantly and brutally drawn up by modernism, are dissolving again, not in a return to what was, but a transformation of it...The division between the living organism and the machine continues to collapse."&lt;ref name="hagan" /&gt;

==Famous works==

Some well-known examples of Zoomorphic architecture can be found in the [[TWA Flight Center]] building in [[New York City]], by [[Eero Saarinen]], or the [[Milwaukee Art Museum]] by [[Santiago Calatrava]], both inspired by the form of a bird’s wings.&lt;ref name="NYT08" /&gt;
[[File:Milwaukee Art Museum 2 (Mulad).jpg|thumb|Oriental Milwaukee Art Museum]]
Also the Oriental village by the sea by [[Basil Al Bayati]] which "is based upon Oriental building types arranged in a plan originating in patterns of insect and plant life.  The exoskeleton of a dragonfly forms the main body of the building's layout, its triangular mouth of stairs on the waterfront leading to the creature's circular head of the entrance lobby. The insect's long segmented yellow body is the central corridor, dome-lit, which intertwines with a branch of a tree, its stem a road and its leaves the roofs of condominiums and leisure facilities.  The colourful berries are cone-topped villas intended to be reminiscent of Chinese temples."&lt;ref name="Bingham" /&gt;
