The '''Graff Diamonds robbery''' took place on 6 August 2009 when two men posing as customers entered the premises of [[Graff Diamonds]] in [[New Bond Street]], London and stole jewellery worth nearly £40 million (US$65 million).&lt;ref name="davenport"&gt;Davenport, Justin.

==The robbery==
The robbers used the services of a professional [[make-up artist]] to alter their skin tones and their features using latex [[Prosthetic makeup|prosthetics]] and to be fitted with professional wigs.&lt;ref name="edwards2"&gt;Edwards, Richard.

On 6 August 2009 at 4:40&amp;nbsp;pm, two sharply dressed men arrived at the Graff Diamonds jewellery store by [[taxicab|taxi]] and once inside produced two handguns which they used to threaten staff. They made no attempt to conceal their faces from the premises' [[CCTV]] cameras due to their elaborate disguises. Even though one of the robbers was wearing [[leather gloves]], store security allowed him entry, being used to the eccentric behaviour of some super-wealthy clients.

Petra Ehnar, a shop assistant, was forced at gunpoint to empty the store's display cabinets. A total of 43 rings, bracelets, necklaces and watches were taken. She was briefly held hostage at gunpoint and was forced into the street during the getaway. She testified that the robbers told her that she would be killed if she did not carry out their demands.&lt;ref name="tol8"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/aug/06/graff-diamonds-robber-jailed Graff Diamonds robber Aman Kassaye jailed for 23 years] ''The Guardian''. (6 August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; After releasing the hostage outside the store, one of the robbers fired a shot into the air to create confusion, and both escaped the scene in a blue [[BMW]] vehicle. This vehicle was abandoned in nearby Dover Street, where a second gunshot was fired into the ground while the robbers switched to a second vehicle, a silver [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]]. They again switched vehicles in Farm Street, after which there was no further information regarding their whereabouts.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

All of the diamonds had been laser-inscribed with the Graff logo and a [[Gemological Institute of America]] identification number.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graffdiamonds.com/_html/index.php?sectionid=1&amp;pgid=26&amp;diamondstyleid=5 Diamond – "The Certificate"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711122052/http://www.graffdiamonds.com/_html/index.php?sectionid=1&amp;pgid=26&amp;diamondstyleid=5 |date=11 July 2011 }}. Graff Diamonds. Retrieved 12 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Detectives investigating the robbery stated: "They knew exactly what they were looking for and we suspect they already had a market for the jewels." The suspects' details were circulated to all ports and airports but police believed they would have an elaborately prepared escape route and had already left the country.&lt;ref name=edwards /&gt;

The robbery was being investigated by [[Barnes, London|Barnes]] [[Flying Squad]], headed by [[Detective Chief Inspector]] Pam Mace.

===Financial loss to Graff Diamonds===

The financial loss to Graff Diamonds was more than US$10 million (£6.6 million). The actual value of the pieces for insurance purposes, was put at $39 million (£26 million). But according to Nicholas Paine, the company secretary, the syndicate that insured Graff was only liable for $28.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jul/06/graff-loses-10m-result-robbery Graff lose over £6m as result of robbery] ''The Guardian''. (6 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrests and charges==
The robbers were caught shortly after police searched one of the getaway cars abandoned by the robbers. A pay-as-you go mobile phone was discovered that robbers Aman Kassaye and Craig Calderwood left in the car after ramming into a black cab. After the collision, in their haste to transfer to a second vehicle, the robbers forgot the mobile phone that was wedged between the driver's seat and the handbrake. Anonymous numbers stored on the mobile phone quickly allowed police to discover the identity of the robber.

On 20 August 2009, two men, Craig Calderwood, 26, of [[no fixed abode]], and Solomun Beyene, 24, of Lilestone Road, London NW8, were [[Indictment|charged]] in connection with the robbery.&lt;ref name=BBC20Aug09&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8212981.stm |title=Two charged over £40m jewel raid  |publisher=BBC News |date=20 August 2009 |accessdate=21 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 August, a third man, Clinton Mogg, 42, of Westby Road, [[Bournemouth]], was also charged, and Calderwood and Beyene were remanded in custody by Westminster Magistrates' Court.&lt;ref name=BBC21Aug09&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8214004.stm |title=Third man charged over jewel raid |publisher=BBC News |date=21 August 2009 |accessdate=21 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 August, Mogg appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court.

''The Times'', (4 September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Aman Kassaye, who planned and executed the heist, was found guilty of conspiracy to rob, kidnap and possession of a firearm after a three-month trial at Woolwich Crown Court. On 7 August 2010, he was sentenced to 23 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/08/07/graff-diamond-armed-robber-gets-23-years-in-prison-115875-22470632 Graff Diamond armed robber gets 23 years in prison], ''Daily Mirror'', (7 August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Three other men – Solomun Beyene, 25, of London, Clinton Mogg, 43, of Bournemouth, and Thomas Thomas, 46, of Kingston upon Thames – were each jailed for 16 years after also being convicted of conspiracy to rob.&lt;ref name="tol8"/&gt; Craig Calderwood was finally jailed for 21 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As of March 2011, none of the stolen jewellery has been recovered. Experts believe the jewellery has probably been broken up so the precious stones could be anonymously resold after being recut.&lt;ref name="tol8"/&gt;

'''''Air Bucks''''' was one of the first [[business simulation game]]s dealing with running an airline. It involves purchasing landing rights for cities around the globe.

In 1993, an enhanced version titled ''Air Bucks v1.2'' was released for the [[Amiga]].

==Gameplay==
The game begins in 1946, after the Second World War. Using default settings, the player controls the airline "Air Bucks" with three AI competitors; all are based in the city of Miami.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue156/100_Air_Bucks_version_1.php|title=Air Bucks version 1.2|last=Olafson|first=Peter|website=www.atarimagazines.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each player purchases landing rights for a surrounding airport not more than 1,000 miles away, as the only plane available at the beginning (the [[Douglas DC-3]]) has a range of 1,000 miles. Usually the first landing rights purchased are in either New York or Washington D.C.  Aside from the initial base airport (Miami by default, but customizable) only two airlines can have landing rights to any one airport.

While waiting for landing rights to be awarded, which takes one month at the beginning of the game and two to three months later on, the player can acquire airplanes and adjust each plane's LOPA (layout of passenger accommodations) by altering the number of first class and coach seats.

Once landing rights are established the player creates a route between two or more cities, sets coach and first class ticket prices, and then assigns planes to the route. The ticket price and service amenities can be constantly adjusted until optimum revenue is generated.

As time progresses, new models of airplanes become available for purchase, such as the Douglas DC-6, de Havilland Comet, Boeing 747, and the Aérospatiale Concorde.

The game's demand model calculates passenger demand for each route based on ticket pricing, plane speed, size of destinations, plane age, service quality (a function of employee wages), advertising spend, aircraft reliability (a function of maintenance spend) and other factors. The game also simulates fuel price fluctuations based on historical [[inflation]] data, and periodically generates weather events and strikes which temporarily close particular airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/120481106/Air-Bucks|title=Air Bucks|website=Scribd|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The default computer companies are "Transglobal Inc", "International GT", and "Great Times". The amount and selection of computer and human players is customizable, as are the company names and logos, starting site, and difficulty.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' gave ''Air Bucks'' a negative review. The magazine criticized the interface, version 1.0's slow game speed, and poor computer AI and economic model, and concluded "Right now, my feeling is that this flight has been delayed".&lt;ref name="brooks199301"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=102 | title=Impressions' Air Bucks | work=Computer Gaming World | date=January 1993 | accessdate=5 July 2014 | author=Brooks, M. Evan | pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 Impressions released version 1.2, advertising that it was a "''New'' Air Bucks!" with "the features you want", including better [[VGA graphics]], interface, computer AI, and economic model. The company ("Committed to customer satisfaction") offered the upgrade for free to registered owners of the game.&lt;ref name="cgw199304"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=105 | title=Check out the New Air Bucks! | work=Computer Gaming World | date=April 1993 | accessdate=6 July 2014 | pages=41 | type=advertisement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cities in Air Bucks==
Air Bucks represents 96 airport sites: 6 in Australia; 2 in New Zealand; 8 in the South Pacific; 25 in Asia; 7 in Africa; 33 in Europe; 1 in Greenland; 1 in Bermuda; 14 in Latin America; 5 in Canada; and 26 in the United States. While the game includes a number of small historical "technical stop" destinations such as [[Wake Island]], [[Kanton Island|Canton Island]], Gander, the [[Azores]], [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]] and [[Recife]], some major cities such as Dubai, Casablanca, Tel Aviv and Brisbane are absent.

Since no more than two airlines can acquire landing rights to any one airport, competition is keen for large-market airports and, early in the game before airplanes have trans-oceanic range, for tech-stop airports.

'''Airports Company of South Africa Limited''' ('''ACSA''') is a [[South Africa|South African]] [[airport]] [[management]] company. Founded in 1993, ACSA operates nine of South Africa’s airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airports.co.za/about-us/airports-company/company-profile |title=Company Profile |author= |publisher=Airports Company of South Africa |date= |accessdate=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is headquartered in the Maples Office Park in [[Bedfordview]], South Africa.&lt;ref name= "Contact Us"/&gt;

==History==
All of South Africa’s airports used to be owned and operated by the state until July 23rd, 1993 when nine airports were reassigned to ACSA. ACSA was then owned by the government through the ministry of transportation.&lt;ref name="official history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wcm.airports.co.za/about-us/airports-company/history|title=History|website=Wcm.airports.co.za|access-date=2016-05-27}}{{Self-published source|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, [[Aeroporti di Roma]] bought 20% of ACSA's shares for 819 million rands,.&lt;ref name="official history"/&gt; In 2005, Public Investment Corporation, a local SA company, bought the 20% shares back from the Italian group.&lt;ref name="official milestones"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wcm.airports.co.za/about-us/airports-company/milestone-in-our-history|title=Milestones in our history|website=Wcm.airports.co.za|access-date=2016-05-27}}{{Self-published source|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, ACSA was part of a consortium that won the bid to manage the [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]] in [[Mumbai]], [[India]].&lt;ref name="official milestones"/&gt;

In 2012, ACSA signed a 20-year concession agreement to manage the [[São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport]] in [[Brazil]], a strategic alliance between two countries that organized the soccer world cup in recent years.&lt;ref name="official milestones"/&gt; The deal was signed through a consortium including Brazil's [[Invepar]] for 51% of the concession and at a cost of $9.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/acsa-consortium-awarded-r70bn-brazil-airport-contract-2012-02-08|title=ACSA consortium awarded R70b Brazil airport contract|website=Engineeringnews.co.za|date=8 February 2012|author=Henry Lazenby|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, ACSA finished installing a solar power plant near the Kimberley Airport as part of a broader plan to install solar farms in all of its regional airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/acsa-unveils-kimberley-airport-solar-power-plant-2016-05-13|title=ACSA unveils Kimberley Airport solar power plant|website=Engineeringnews.co.za|date=13 May 2016|author=Annie Kilian|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Airports ==
The following international airports are operated by ACSA:
* [[Johannesburg Airport]] (O.R. Tambo)
* [[Cape Town Airport]]
* Durban [[King Shaka Airport]]
* [[Bloemfontein Airport]]
* [[Upington Airport]]
* [[Port Elizabeth Airport]]
* São Paulo [[Guarulhos Airport]], [[Brazil]]
* Mumbai [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Airport]], [[India]] (consortium with [[Bidvest Group|Bidvest]] and [[Airports Authority of India]])

The following local airports are operated by ACSA:
* [[East London Airport]]
* [[George Airport]]
* [[Kimberley Airport]]

== Controversy ==
On 25 March 2006 gunmen armed with [[AK-47]]s stole bags containing several million [[US dollars]] at [[Johannesburg Airport]] (O.R. Tambo). Three ACSA employees and six other individuals were arrested and appeared in court in connection with the heist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_1918385,00.html|title=News24 {{!}} South Africa's leading source of breaking news, opinion and insight|website=News24|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3478">In chemistry, '''ammoxidation''' is an industrial process for the production of [[nitrile]]s using [[ammonia]] and [[oxygen]]. The usual substrates are [[alkene]]s. It is sometimes called the '''Sohio process''', acknowledging that ammoxidation was first discovered by [[Standard Oil of Ohio]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Callahan|first1=James L.|last2=Grasselli|first2=Robert K.|last3=Milberger|first3=Ernest C.|last4=Strecker|first4=H. Arthur|title=Oxidation and Ammoxidation of Propylene over Bismuth Molybdate Catalyst|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Product Research and Development|date=1 June 1970|volume=9|issue=2|pages=134–142|doi=10.1021/i360034a003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ACS_Landmarks&gt;{{cite web|title=Sohio Acrylonitrile Process - American Chemical Society|url=http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/acrylonitrile.html|website=American Chemical Society|accessdate=11 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important application of this process is the production of [[acrylonitrile]]:&lt;ref&gt;Peter Pollak, Gérard Romeder, Ferdinand Hagedorn, Heinz-Peter Gelbke "Nitriles" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a17_363}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  3/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;   →   NCCH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Several million tons of acrylonitrile are produced in this way annually. The solvent [[acetonitrile]] is a byproduct of this process.&lt;ref name="ACS Landmarks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/acrylonitrile/index.htm |title=The Sohio Acrylonitrile Process |publisher=American Chemical Society |work=National Historic Chemical Landmarks |accessdate=March 25, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
Ammoxidation of alkenes exploits the weak C-H bonds that are located in the [[allyl]]ic position of unsaturated hydrocarbons. [[Benzyl]]ic C-H bonds are also susceptible to ammoxidation, reflecting the weakness of their C-H bonds.  For this reason, cyanopyridines (e.g. [[3-cyanopyridine]], the precursor to [[niacin]]) and [[benzonitrile]]s are produced from methyl[[pyridine]]s and [[toluene]], respectively.  ''Di''nitriles are produced by double ammoxidation, examples being [[phthalonitrile]]s (precursor to [[phthalocyanine]]s) and terephthalonitriles, both from [[xylene]]s.

Typical catalysts are the oxides of vanadium and molybdenum. [[Transition-metal allyl complex|π-Allyl complexes]] are assumed as intermediates.&lt;ref&gt;Nugent, W. A.; Mayer, J. M., Metal-Ligand Multiple Bonds. J. Wiley: New York, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related processes==
Instead of alkenes, [[alcohol]]s and [[aldehyde]]s are competent substrates:
:O=CHCH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  1/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;   →   NCCH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;   →   NCCH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
These substrates are usually more expensive than the alkenes, so they are less common.

[[Hydrogen cyanide]] is prepared by an ammoxidation-like reaction of methane, the [[Andrussov oxidation]]:
:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  3/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →   HCN  +  3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

In 2013, Arkadiy Abramovich started working as an intern at the London office of Russian, VTB Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/abramovich-junior-interning-at-vtb-london-21236|title=Abramovich Junior Interning at VTB London|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, he bought a 45% share in the shell company Zoltav Resources, and purchased a stake in an oil field in Siberia for a reported $46 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/mar/20/roman-abramovichs-son-arkadiy|title=How Roman Abramovich's son Arkadiy is following in his father's footsteps|last=Hickman|first=Leo|date=2013-03-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; $26 million of the $46 million were funneled through Zoltav to purchase CenGeo Holdings - owner of the undeveloped Koltogor oil field in Western Siberia.

In 2014, Zoltav completed the acquisition of Royal Atlantic Energy (Cyprus) Limited and began trading on the London Stock Exchange's  Alternative Investment Market (AIM) department. Zoltav also purchased a full license for gas exploration, extraction and production in the Bortovoy area, which contains several active gas fields, 750 billion cubic feet of substantiated gas reserves, 3.9 million barrels of condensate, and a processing plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2014/06/19/arkadiy-abramovichs-zoltav-resources-announces-new-oil-acquisitions/|title=Arkadiy Abramovich’s Zoltav Resources Announces New Oil Acquisitions - Jewish Business News|date=2014-06-19|work=Jewish Business News|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/59219/arkadiy-abramovichs-zoltav-resources-restarts-aim-trading-after-russian-acquisition-69566.html|title=Arkadiy Abramovich’s Zoltav Resources restarts AIM trading after Russian acquisition|work=Proactiveinvestors UK|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the value of the investment remains undisclosed, reports note that the farming venture would focus on growing cucumbers and tomatoes in the Belgorod region, 700&amp;nbsp;km south of Moscow. According to authorities in the Rostov region, earlier the same year Abramovich Jr. began planning a major investment (approx. $700 million) in greenhouse development in the region. The terms are still under negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rbth.com/business/2016/05/17/why-has-roman-abramovichs-son-become-a-cucumber-farmer_593753|title=Why has Roman Abramovich’s son become a cucumber farmer?|last=Kuchma|first=Anna|date=2016-05-17|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, it was reported that Arkadiy had offered €250million to purchase a controlling stake in [[CSKA Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/son-of-chelsea-owner-roman-abramovich-launches-club-takeover-4197714|title=Son of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich launches club takeover - Tribal Football|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Attention marketing''' is the term, coined&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last=Flint|first=James|title=Attention marketing, the real social revolution|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/offshorefinance/9188989/Attention-marketing-the-real-social-revolution.html|accessdate=11 April 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by internet [[entrepreneur]] Steve Jelley to describe a particular business model that has evolved around the growth of [[social media]] on the internet. It was popularized by the book ''[[Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable]]'' by [[Seth Godin]].

The phenomenon is an extension of [[marketing]], which describes the generation of consumer interest or inquiry into products or services of a business. Traditionally, businesses have generated customers using the techniques of [[Internet marketing]], such as [[search engine marketing]] (SEM), [[search engine optimization|search engine optimisation]] (SEO), [[web banner|banner ads]] on specific websites, [[email marketing]], and [[mobile advertising]]. 

Social media companies such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and [[Pinterest]], by contrast, do not rely on these tools to generate user attention. [[User-generated content]] makes up the majority content on these sites; users therefore view content on the sites according to what interests them most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Constine|first=Josh|title=Facebook Ads Can Now Be Optimized To Drive Any On-Facebook Action, Such As In-App Purchases, Shares, Offer Claims|url=http://m.techcrunch.com/2012/04/18/facebook-ads-downstream-conversions/?icid=tc__art&amp;|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Srinivasan|first=Rags|title=How much does Pinterest actually make?|url=http://gigaom.com/2012/03/30/how-much-does-pinterest-actually-make/|publisher=GigaOm|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behaviour collapses the traditional barriers between content, distribution and marketing, as any activity on a social media site effectively achieves all these three functions simultaneously.

==Business opportunity==

Rather than interrupting users' attention in order to market to them, the business opportunity available to social media is in capturing people’s attention and channeling this attention to an appropriate vendor when it presents itself as a genuine desire to buy.

Previously, it was very difficult and expensive for business to market themselves on anything other than a mass, or broadcast basis. Targeting messages to individuals, at any kind of effective scale, was all but impossible. But social media has changed that. By using social media channels to target according to users' attention, business and other organisations can make their messages far more relevant and appropriate to individual consumers. 

For businesses to suddenly shift commercial focus from the mass attention of a broad audience to the particular attention of individuals, however, requires a complete change of corporate mindset. Inside media and marketing organisations, content production, distribution and marketing have traditionally occupied different - and usually warring - silos. Because of the intimate connection between the content and the opportunity to create a lead, however, attention marketing necessarily collapses these silos and brings them together.

'''Business intelligence''' ('''BI''') comprises the strategies and technologies used by enterprises for the [[data analysis]] of [[business information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dedić N. &amp; Stanier C.|year=2016|title=Measuring the Success of Changes to Existing Business Intelligence Solutions to Improve Business Intelligence Reporting.

Common functions of business intelligence technologies include [[business reporting|reporting]], [[online analytical processing]], [[analytics]], [[data mining]], [[process mining]], [[complex event processing]], [[business performance management]], [[benchmarking]], [[text mining]], [[Predictive Analysis|predictive analytics]] and [[Prescriptive Analytics|prescriptive analytics]]. BI technologies can handle large amounts of structured and sometimes unstructured data to help identify, develop and otherwise create new strategic [[business opportunities]]. They aim to allow for the easy interpretation of these [[big data]]. Identifying new opportunities and implementing an effective strategy based on [[insight]]s can provide [[business]]es with a competitive market advantage and long-term stability.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book |title= Business Intelligence Success Factors: Tools for Aligning Your Business in the Global Economy |last= Rud|first= Olivia |year= 2009|publisher= Wiley &amp; Sons|location= Hoboken, N.J|isbn= 978-0-470-39240-9 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Business intelligence can be used by enterprises to support a wide range of business decisions ranging from operational to strategic. Basic operating decisions include product positioning or pricing.  [[Business strategy|Strategic business]] decisions involve priorities, [[goal]]s and directions at the broadest level. In all cases, BI is most effective when it combines data derived from the market in which a [[company]] operates (external data) with data from company sources internal to the business such as financial and operations data (internal data). When combined, external and internal data can provide a complete picture which, in effect, creates an "intelligence" that cannot be derived from any singular set of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1= Coker| first1= Frank | title= Pulse: Understanding the Vital Signs of Your Business | publisher= Ambient Light Publishing

==History==
The earliest known use of the term ''business intelligence'' is in Richard Millar Devens' ''Cyclopædia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes'' (1865). Devens used the term to describe how the banker [[Sir Henry Furnese, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Furnese]] gained profit by receiving and acting upon information about his environment, prior to his competitors:
{{quote|Throughout Holland, Flanders, France, and Germany, he maintained a complete and perfect train of business intelligence. The news of the many battles fought was thus received first by him, and the [[Siege of Namur (1695)|fall of Namur]] added to his profits, owing to his early receipt of the news.|author=Devens |source=p.&amp;nbsp;210}}

The ability to collect and react accordingly based on the information retrieved, Devens says, is central to business intelligence.&lt;ref name="Miller Devens"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller Devens|first=Richard|title=Cyclopaedia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes; Comprising Interesting Reminiscences and Facts, Remarkable Traits and Humors of Merchants, Traders, Bankers Etc. in All Ages and Countries|url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=9MspAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq=%22business+intelligence%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=a5EPTdaRIsOWnAeVyYHQDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22business%20intelligence%22&amp;f=false|publisher=D. Appleton and company|accessdate=15 February 2014|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Hans Peter Luhn]], a researcher at [[IBM]], used the term ''business intelligence'' in an article published in 1958, he employed the ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' definition of intelligence: "the ability to apprehend the interrelationships of presented facts in such a way as to guide action towards a desired goal."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|url= http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/024/ibmrd0204H.pdf|doi=10.1147/rd.24.0314|title= A Business Intelligence System|author=H P Luhn |authorlink= Hans Peter Luhn |year= 1958 |journal= IBM Journal|volume= 2|issue= 4|pages= 314|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913121526/http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/024/ibmrd0204H.pdf|archivedate=2008-09-13}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Business intelligence as it is understood today is said to have evolved from the [[decision support system]]s (DSS) that began in the 1960s and developed throughout the mid-1980s.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} DSS originated in the computer-aided models created to assist with [[decision making]] and planning.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 1989, Howard Dresner (later a [[Gartner]] analyst) proposed ''business intelligence'' as an [[umbrella term]] to describe "concepts and methods to improve business decision making by using fact-based support systems."&lt;ref name=power&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dssresources.com/history/dsshistory.html |title= A Brief History of Decision Support Systems, version 4.0 |accessdate=10 July 2008 |author= D. J. Power |date= 10 March 2007|publisher= DSSResources.COM }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 1990s that this usage was widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dssresources.com/history/dsshistory.html |title=A Brief History of Decision Support Systems |last=Power |first=D. J. |accessdate=1 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics{{who|date=August 2018}} see BI merely as an evolution of [[business reporting]] together with the advent of increasingly powerful and easy-to-use [[data analysis]] tools. In this respect it has also been criticized{{by whom|date=August 2018}} as a marketing buzzword in the context of the "[[big data]]" surge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decoding big data buzzwords|year=2015|quote=BI refers to the approaches, tools, mechanisms that organizations can use to keep a finger on the pulse of their businesses. Also referred by unsexy versions -- “dashboarding”, “MIS” or “reporting.”|publisher=cio.com|url=http://www.cio.com/article/2919082/big-data/what-are-they-talking-about-decoding-big-data-buzzwords.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
According to [[Forrester Research]], business intelligence is "a set of methodologies, processes, architectures, and technologies that transform raw data into meaningful and useful information used to enable more effective strategic, tactical, and operational insights and decision-making."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forrester.com/report/Topic+Overview+Business+Intelligence/-/E-RES39218 |title=Topic Overview: Business Intelligence |last=Evelson |first=Boris |date=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition, business intelligence encompasses [[information management]] ([[data integration]], [[data quality]], data warehousing, master-data management, text- and content-analytics, et al.). Therefore, Forrester refers to ''data preparation'' and ''data usage'' as two separate but closely linked segments of the business-intelligence architectural stack.

Some elements of business intelligence are:{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

* Multidimensional [[Aggregate (data warehouse)|aggregation]] and allocation
* [[Denormalization]], tagging, and standardization
* Realtime reporting with analytical alert
* A method of interfacing with [[unstructured data]] sources
* Group consolidation, budgeting and [[rolling forecast]]s
* [[Statistical inference]] and probabilistic simulation
* [[Key performance indicator]]s optimization
* Version control and process management
* Open item management

Forrester distinguishes this from the ''business-intelligence market'', which is "just the top layers of the BI architectural stack, such as [[Data reporting|reporting]], [[analytics]], and [[Dashboards (management information systems)|dashboards]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Want to know what Forrester's lead data analysts are thinking about BI and the data domain? |last=Evelson |first=Boris |date=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compared with competitive intelligence===
Though the term business intelligence is sometimes a synonym for [[competitive intelligence]] (because they both support [[decision making]]), BI uses technologies, processes, and applications to analyze mostly internal, structured data and business processes while competitive intelligence gathers, analyzes and disseminates information with a topical focus on company competitors. If understood broadly, business intelligence can include the subset of competitive intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.forrester.com/james_kobielus/10-04-30-what%E2%80%99s_not_bi_oh_don%E2%80%99t_get_me_startedoops_too_latehere_goes |title=What’s Not BI? Oh, Don’t Get Me Started....Oops Too Late...Here Goes.... |last=Kobielus |first=James |date=30 April 2010 |quote=“Business” intelligence is a non-domain-specific catchall for all the types of analytic data that can be delivered to users in reports, dashboards, and the like. When you specify the subject domain for this intelligence, then you can refer to “competitive intelligence,” “market intelligence,” “social intelligence,” “financial intelligence,” “HR intelligence,” “supply chain intelligence,” and the like.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compared with business analytics===
Business intelligence and [[business analytics]] are sometimes used interchangeably, but there are alternate definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timoelliott.com/blog/2011/03/business-analytics-vs-business-intelligence.html |title=Business Analytics vs Business Intelligence? |publisher=timoelliott.com |date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas H. Davenport|Thomas Davenport]], professor of information technology and management at [[Babson College]] argues that business intelligence should be divided into [[Information retrieval|querying]], [[Business reporting|reporting]], [[Online analytical processing]] (OLAP), an "alerts" tool, and business analytics. In this definition, business analytics is the subset of BI focusing on statistics, prediction, and optimization, rather than the reporting functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite interview |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/bi/222200096 |title=Analytics at Work: Q&amp;A with Tom Davenport |last=Henschen |first=Doug |date=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components of the BI landscape==
The Business Intelligence landscape reflects the complex system which data goes through in order to get processed into information. One of the first steps of starting a BI program, is to understand all components of this landscape. The particularities of this system tend to differ based on the industry and organization, but at a macro level, all BI landscapes have the same format. It’s usually composed of five pillars and five foundation blocks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lightsondata.com/business-intelligence-landscape-components/|title=10 components of the Business Intelligence landscape - LightsOnData|date=2018-07-04|work=LightsOnData|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

The five pillars:

# Data source(s)
# Data integration
# Data management
# Reports 
# Information dissemination

The five foundation blocks:

# Information security
# Data quality
# Metadata management
# Data governance
# People &amp; culture

==Data==
Business operations can generate a very large amount of information in the form of e-mails, memos, notes from call-centers, news, user groups, chats, reports, web-pages, presentations, image-files, video-files, and marketing material. According to [[Merrill Lynch]], more than 85% of all business information exists in these forms; a company might only use such a document a single time.&lt;ref name = rao&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/MITP.2003.1254966 |url=http://www.ramanarao.com/papers/rao-itpro-2003-11.pdf|title=From unstructured data to actionable intelligence|year=2003|last1=Rao|first1=R.|journal=IT Professional|volume=5|issue=6|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the way it is produced and stored, this information is either [[Unstructured data|unstructured]] or [[semi-structured data|semi-structured]].

The management of semi-structured data is an unsolved problem in the information technology industry.&lt;ref name=blumberg&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://soquelgroup.com/Articles/dmreview_0203_problem.pdf|author1=Blumberg, R.|author2=S. Atre|lastauthoramp=yes|title=The Problem with Unstructured Data|journal=DM Review|year=2003|pages=42–46|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125033210/http://soquelgroup.com/Articles/dmreview_0203_problem.pdf|archivedate=25 January 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to projections from Gartner (2003), white collar workers spend 30–40% of their time searching, finding, and assessing unstructured data. BI uses both structured and unstructured data. The former is easy to search, and the latter contains a large quantity of the information needed for analysis and decision making.&lt;ref name = blumberg /&gt;&lt;ref name = negash&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://site.xavier.edu/sena/info600/businessintelligence.pdf|author=Negash, S |title=Business Intelligence|journal= Communications of the Association of Information Systems|volume=13|year= 2004|pages=177–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the difficulty of properly searching, finding and assessing unstructured or semi-structured data, organizations may not draw upon these vast reservoirs of information, which could influence a particular decision, task or project. This can ultimately lead to poorly informed decision making.&lt;ref name = rao /&gt;

Therefore, when designing a business intelligence/DW-solution, the specific problems associated with semi-structured and unstructured data must be accommodated for as well as those for the structured data.&lt;ref name = negash /&gt;

===Unstructured data vs. semi-structured data===
Unstructured and semi-structured data have different meanings depending on their context. In the context of relational database systems, unstructured data cannot be stored in predictably ordered [[columns]] and [[Row (database)|rows]]. One type of unstructured data is typically stored in a [[BLOB]] (binary large object), a catch-all data type available in most [[relational database]] management systems. Unstructured data may also refer to irregularly or randomly repeated (nonrepetitive) column patterns that vary from row to row within each file or document.&lt;ref name="InmonUntang14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/blog/untangling-definition-unstructured-data |title=Untangling the Definition of Unstructured Data |author=Inmon, W.H. |work=Big Data &amp; Analytics Hub |publisher=IBM |date=25 July 2014 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these data types, however, like e-mails, word processing text files, PPTs, image-files, and video-files conform to a standard that offers the possibility of metadata. Metadata can include information such as author and time of creation, and this can be stored in a relational database.
Therefore, it may be more accurate to talk about this as semi-structured documents or data,&lt;ref name = blumberg /&gt; but no specific consensus seems to have been reached.

Unstructured data can also simply be the knowledge that business users have about future business trends. Business forecasting naturally aligns with the BI system because business users think of their business in aggregate terms. Capturing the business knowledge that may only exist in the minds of business users provides some of the most important data points for a complete BI solution.

===Limitations of semi-structured and unstructured data===
There are several challenges to developing BI with semi-structured data. According to Inmon &amp; Nesavich,&lt;ref name = inmon&gt;Inmon, B. &amp; A. Nesavich, "Unstructured Textual Data in the Organization" from "Managing Unstructured data in the organization", Prentice Hall 2008, pp. 1–13&lt;/ref&gt; some of those are:

* Physically accessing unstructured textual data&amp;nbsp;– unstructured data is stored in a huge variety of formats.
* [[Terminology]]&amp;nbsp;– Among researchers and analysts, there is a need to develop a standardized terminology.
* Volume of data&amp;nbsp;– As stated earlier, up to 85% of all data exists as semi-structured data. Couple that with the need for word-to-word and semantic analysis.
* Searchability of unstructured textual data&amp;nbsp;– A simple search on some data, e.g. apple, results in links where there is a reference to that precise search term. (Inmon &amp; Nesavich, 2008)&lt;ref name = inmon /&gt; gives an example: “a search is made on the term felony. In a simple search, the term felony is used, and everywhere there is a reference to felony, a hit to an unstructured document is made. But a simple search is crude. It does not find references to crime, arson, murder, embezzlement, vehicular homicide, and such, even though these crimes are types of felonies.”

===Metadata===
To solve problems with searchability and assessment of data, it is necessary to know something about the content. This can be done by adding context through the use of [[metadata]].&lt;ref name = rao /&gt; Many systems already capture some metadata (e.g. filename, author, size, etc.), but more useful would be metadata about the actual content&amp;nbsp;– e.g. summaries, topics, people or companies mentioned. Two technologies designed for generating metadata about content are automatic categorization and [[information extraction]].

==Applications==
Business intelligence can be applied to the following business purposes:&lt;ref name="FeldmanDeveloping13"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDXfeopC-kMC&amp;pg=PA140 |title=Developing Business Intelligence Apps for SharePoint |author=Feldman, D.; Himmelstein, J. |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc |pages=140–1 |year=2013 |isbn=9781449324681 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Performance metrics]] and [[benchmarking]] inform business leaders of progress towards business goals ([[business process management]]).
* [[Analytics]] quantify processes for a business to arrive at optimal decisions, and to perform business knowledge discovery. Analytics may variously involve [[data mining]], [[process mining]], [[statistical analysis]], [[predictive analytics]], [[predictive modeling]], [[business process modeling]], [[data lineage]], [[complex event processing]] and [[prescriptive analytics]].
* [[Business reporting]] can use BI data to inform strategy. Business reporting may involve [[data visualization]], [[executive information system]], and/or [[OLAP]]
* BI can facilitate [[collaboration]] both inside and outside the business by enabling [[data sharing]] and [[electronic data interchange]]
* [[Knowledge management]] is concerned with the creation, distribution, use, and management of business intelligence, and of business knowledge in general. Knowledge management leads to [[learning management]] and [[regulatory compliance]].

==Marketplace==
In a 2013 report, Gartner categorized business intelligence vendors as either an independent "pure-play" vendor or a consolidated "megavendor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/gartner-releases-2013-bi-magic-quadrant-7000011264/ |title=Gartner releases 2013 BI Magic Quadrant |publisher=ZDNet |author=Andrew Brust| date= 2013-02-14|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bi-verdict.com/fileadmin/FreeAnalyses/consolidations.htm |title=Consolidations in the BI industry |date=7 March 2008 |last=Pendse |first=Nigel |work=The OLAP Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 business intelligence services received $13.1 billion in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gartner Says Worldwide Business Intelligence, CPM and Analytic Applications/Performance Management Software Market Grew Seven Percent in 2012 |url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2507915 |website=Gartner.com |accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical predictions===
A 2009 paper predicted&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=856714 Gartner Reveals Five Business Intelligence Predictions for 2009 and Beyond]. gartner.com. 15 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; these developments in the business intelligence market:

* Because of lack of information, processes, and tools, through 2012, more than 35 percent of the top 5,000 global companies regularly fail to make insightful decisions about significant changes in their business and markets.
* By 2012, business units will control at least 40 percent of the total budget for business intelligence.
* By 2012, one-third of analytic applications applied to business processes will be delivered through [[Granularity|coarse-grained]] application [[mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]].

A 2009 ''Information Management'' special report predicted the top BI trends: "[[green computing]], [[social networking service]]s, [[data visualization]], [[Mobile business intelligence|mobile BI]], [[predictive analytics]], [[composite application]]s, [[cloud computing]] and [[Multi-touch|multitouch]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.information-management.com/specialreports/2009_148/business_intelligence_data_vizualization_social_networking_analytics-10015628-1.html |title=10 Red Hot BI Trends |last=Campbell |first=Don |date=23 June 2009 |work=Information Management}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research undertaken in 2014 indicated that employees are more likely to have access to, and more likely to engage with, cloud-based BI tools than traditional tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aberdeen.com/Aberdeen-Library/8906/RR-analytics-cloud-saas-bi.aspx |title=Cloud Analytics in 2014: Infusing the Workforce with Insight |last=Lock|first=Michael|date=27 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other business intelligence trends include the following:
* Third party SOA-BI products increasingly address [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] issues of volume and throughput.
* Companies embrace in-memory processing, 64-bit processing, and pre-packaged analytic BI applications.
* Operational applications have callable BI components, with improvements in response time, scaling, and concurrency.
* Near or real time BI analytics is a baseline expectation.
* Open source BI software replaces vendor offerings.

Other lines of research include the combined study of business intelligence and uncertain data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Instead, data is considered uncertain and therefore this uncertainty is propagated to the results produced by BI.

According to a study by the Aberdeen Group, there has been increasing interest in [[Software-as-a-Service]] (SaaS) business intelligence over the past years, with twice as many organizations using this deployment approach as one year ago&amp;nbsp;– 15% in 2009 compared to 7% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Julian|first1=Taylor|title=Business intelligence implementation according to customer's needs|url=http://apro-software.com/services/software-development/business-intelligence|publisher=APRO Software|accessdate=16 May 2016|date=10 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article by InfoWorld's Chris Kanaracus points out similar growth data from research firm IDC, which predicts the SaaS BI market will grow 22 percent each year through 2013 thanks to increased product sophistication, strained IT budgets, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/saas-bi-growth-will-soar-in-2010-511 SaaS BI growth will soar in 2010 | Cloud Computing].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8023">'''Business intelligence software''' is a type of [[application software]] designed to retrieve, analyze, transform and report data for [[business intelligence]].  The applications generally read data that has been previously stored, often - though not necessarily - in a [[data warehouse]] or [[data mart]].

==History==
===Development of business intelligence software===
The first comprehensive business intelligence systems were developed by [[IBM]] and [[Siebel Systems|Siebel]] (currently acquired by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]) in the period between 1970 and 1990.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite news | last = | first =| title =History of Business Intelligence Software| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''business-intelligence.financesonline.com''| date =| url =https://business-intelligence.financesonline.com/#history | accessdate =28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref &gt;{{cite news | last = | first =| title =A Detailed Look At The History Of Business Intelligence Software| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''comparecamp.com''| date =| url =http://comparecamp.com/detailed-look-history-business-intelligence-software | accessdate =28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, small developer teams were emerging with attractive ideas, and pushing out some of the products companies still use nowadays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oracle.com/us/support/licensecodes/siebel/siebel-crm-bi-integration-166917.html "Integrating Oracle Business Intelligence / Siebel Analytics with Siebel CRM"], ''oracle.com'',.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, specialists and vendors organized a Multiway Data Analysis Consortium in [[Rome]], where they considered making data management and analytics more efficient, and foremost available to smaller and financially restricted businesses. By 2000, there were many professional reporting systems and analytic programs, some owned by top performing software producers in the [[United States|United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470238004.fmatter/pdf "Applied Multiway Data Analysis"], ''onlinelibrary.wiley.com'',.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloud-hosted business intelligence software===
In the years after 2000, business intelligence software producers became interested in producing universally applicable BI systems which don’t require expensive installation, and could hence be considered by smaller and midmarket businesses which could not afford on premise maintenance. These aspirations emerged in parallel with the cloud hosting trend, which is how most vendors came to develop independent systems with unrestricted access to information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compudata.com/cloud-bi/ "Cloud BI: 5 Benefits of Cloud Business Intelligence"], ''compudata.com'',.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2006 onwards, the positive effects of cloud-stored information and data management transformed itself to a completely mobile-affectioned one, mostly to the benefit of decentralized and remote teams looking to tweak data or gain full visibility over it out of office. As a response to the large success of fully optimized uni-browser versions, vendors have recently begun releasing mobile-specific product applications for both [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/feature/Mobile-business-intelligence-brings-benefits-and-barriers "Mobile business intelligence brings benefits -- and barriers"], ''searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com'',.&lt;/ref&gt; Cloud-hosted data analytics made it possible for companies to categorize and process large volumes of data, which is how we can currently speak of unlimited visualization, and intelligent decision making.

== Types ==
The key general categories of business intelligence applications are:
* [[Spreadsheets]]
* [[List of reporting software|Reporting and querying software]]: applications that extract, sort, summarize, and present selected data
* [[Online analytical processing]] (OLAP)
* [[Dashboard (management information system)|Digital dashboards]]
* [[Data mining]]
* [[Business activity monitoring]]
* [[Data warehouse]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180726071809/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/exploring-data-warehouses-and-data-quality Exploring Data Warehouses and Data Quality] Published by Spotless Data Retrieved 15 May, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Local information systems]]
* [[Data cleansing]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171018181046/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/exploring-data-analysis Exploring Data Analysis] Published by Spotless Data Retrieved 15 May, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for spreadsheets, these tools are provided as standalone applications, suites of applications, components of [[Enterprise resource planning]] systems, [[application programming interface]]s or as components of software targeted to a specific industry. The tools are sometimes packaged into [[data warehouse appliance]]s.

{{Unreferenced|date=August 2008}}
'''Closure''' is the term used to refer to the actions necessary when it is no longer necessary or possible for a [[business]] or other organization to continue to operate.  Closure may be the result of a [[bankruptcy]], where the organization lacks sufficient funds to continue operations, as a result of the [[proprietor]] of the business dying, as a result of a business being purchased by another organization (or a competitor) and shut down as superfluous, or because it is the non-surviving entity in a [[corporate merger]].  A closure may occur because the purpose for which the organization was created is no longer necessary.

While a closure is typically of a business or a [[non-profit organization]], any [[entity]] which is created by human beings can be subject to a closure, from a single church to a whole religion, up to and including an entire country if, for some reason, it ceases to exist.

Closures are of two types, voluntary or involuntary. Voluntary closures of organizations are much rarer than involuntary ones{{fact|date=December 2013}}, as, in the absence of some change making operations impossible or unnecessary, most operations will continue until something happens that causes a change requiring this situation.

The most common form of voluntary closure would be when those involved in an organization such as a social club, a band, or other non-profit organization decide to cease operating. Once the organization has paid any outstanding debts and completed any pending operations, closure may simply mean that the organization ceases to exist.

If an organization has debts that cannot be paid, it may be necessary to perform a liquidation of its assets. If there is anything left after the assets are converted to cash, in the case of a for-profit organization, the remainder is distributed to the stockholders; in the case of a non-profit, by law{{clarifyme|date=December 2013}} any remaining assets must be distributed to another non-profit.

If an organization has more debts than assets, it may have to declare bankruptcy. If the organization is viable, it may reorganizes itself as a result of the bankruptcy and continue operations. If it is not viable for the business to continue operating, then a closure occurs through a bankruptcy [[liquidation]]: its assets are liquidated, the creditors are paid from whatever assets could be liquidated, and the business ceases operations.

Possibly the largest "closure" in history (but more closely analogous to a demerger) was the split of the [[Soviet Union]] into its constituent countries. In comparison, the end of [[East Germany]] can be considered a [[merger]] rather than a closure as [[West Germany]] assumed all of the assets and liabilities of [[East Germany]]. The end of the Soviet Union was the equivalent of a closure through a bankruptcy liquidation, because while [[Russia]] assumed most of the assets and responsibilities of the former Soviet Union, it did not assume all of them. There have been issues over who is responsible for unpaid [[parking ticket]]s accumulated by [[motor vehicle]]s operated on behalf of [[diplomatic mission]]s operated by the former Soviet Union in other countries, as Russia claims it is not responsible for them.

Several major business closures include the bankruptcy of the [[Penn Central]] railroad, the [[Enron scandal]]s, and [[MCI Worldcom]]'s bankruptcy and eventual merger into [[Verizon]].

The '''Diplôme d'Ingénieur''' ({{IPA-fr|diplom dɛ̃ʒenjœʁ|lang}}, often abbreviated as ''Dipl. Ing.'') is a postgraduate degree in engineering ''(see [[Engineer's degree|Engineer's Degrees in Europe]])'' awarded by the French [[Grandes Écoles]] in engineering. It is generally obtained after five to seven years of studies after the French [[Baccalauréat]].

Each holder of the diplôme d'ingénieur is also conferred the title of ''Ingénieur diplômé'' (graduate engineer). This is distinguished from the term '''ingénieur''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' (engineer) which is non-regulated and can be loosely used as a generic title based on one's professional position or nature of work rather than formal academic qualifications. 

Diplôme d'ingénieur graduates from reputable institutions often access the French job market with a significant advantage compared to PhDs. However, this is not always true for all industries, and roles that require high technical expertise (especially research in specific area) will favor a specialized master's or PhD qualification. 

==Accreditation==
The title ''Ingénieur diplômé'' is a strictly regulated and protected by the French state. Any institution issuing the diplôme d'ingénieur must be accredited by the [[Commission des titres d'ingénieur]] (within the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research) which is the official administrative body responsible for evaluating higher education institutions to train professional engineers in France. Anyone found to be misusing the title of ''Ingénieur diplômé'' is liable to a €15,000 fine and a one-year sentence in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000021342951&amp;dateTexte=20151002|title=Article 433-17 of the French Penal Code|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=French|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071191&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006525290&amp;dateTexte=20151002|title=Article L642-12 of the French Educational Code|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=French|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the signing of the [[Bologna Process]] in 1999, the European [[Master's Degree]] is also conferred by the state to the holder of a diplôme d'ingénieur, but the converse is not true. This is because the diplôme d'ingénieur is recognised to include, but significantly surpass, a [[Bologna Process]] [[Master's Degree]]. 

The diplôme d'ingénieur is also recognized in the United States by the [[AACRAO]] since 2013 as "Master of Science in Engineering".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cti-commission.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mou_aacrao-cti.pdf Memorandum of Understanding (AACRAO - CTI)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grandes Écoles and Universities in France ==
France is particular in that only accredited [[Grandes écoles|Grandes Écoles]] in engineering are certified to issue the diplôme d'ingénieur, which is differentiated from bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering issued by public universities (Universités).

Universities in France are comprehensive institutions composed of several faculties covering various fields (natural sciences, engineering, law, economics, medicine, humanities, etc) with a large student body. By law, admission to a French university is non-competitive and open to anyone with a high school diploma. On the other hand, Grandes Écoles in engineering are much smaller in size and recruit their students with very selective processes (typically a few hundred students per year per institution, and a few thousand students per year country-wide), with the minimum qualification being 2 years of post-baccalureate studies in scientific [[Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles|classes préparatoires]], three to four years University studies (Bachelors or Masters), or an otherwise equivalent training for foreign students, in order to be admitted to the engineer training in one of the Grandes Écoles.

==Curriculum==
The engineer training leading to the diplôme d'ingénieur may vary significantly among the Grandes Écoles in terms of curriculum structure, despite the same accreditation from CTI. In general, the most prestigious (therefore highly selective) Grandes Écoles tend to offer a multidisciplinary&lt;nowiki/&gt; curriculum for their flagship engineer program, exposing students to various fields of study with each courses taught at a graduate level. The multidisciplinary engineer program in the so-called 'generalist' Grandes Écoles is usually considered to be more competitive and intensive than specialized master's degree programs. However, this is not always the case, and there are a number of well-established Grandes Écoles that focus on a specialized curriculum for their engineer program.

Student engineers in Grandes Écoles are educated in close cooperation with the various industries through academic-industry partnerships, which introduce graduates to professional life while giving them a solid grounding in their discipline. As many graduates will advance to positions leading future projects and teams, courses related to management and professional training are also included in the curriculum.

In addition to the core curriculum in engineering and science, the French engineer training often includes, and is not limited to:
* courses in humanities and social sciences
* courses in business administration
* visits to production sites
* conferences and career talks by professionals
* internships and research projects

==Professional training==
More than 90 percent of the French engineer programs require at least one internship (typically in a business setting) at some point in the curriculum.

Most schools arrange three types of internships that train the students with progressive responsibilities, initially as observers and increasingly as actors, in order to gain a comprehensive understanding and perspective of all levels of responsibility and roles within the industry. One can distinguish “worker” (blue-collar) internships, “senior technician” internships, and “graduate” internships where the students perform the same type of work they will do as graduate engineers. Internships are graded and constitute part of the academic degree requirements.

'''Eliana Benador''' (also '''Eleana Benador''') is a Swiss-American public relations consultant, global strategist, and a publicist for American and Middle Eastern [[neo-conservatives]].&lt;ref name=lobe&gt;Lobe, Jim, [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/EH15Aa01.html ''The Andean Condor among the Hawks’'], Asian Times, August 15, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Through the development of Benador Associates, Benador was promoted national security policies advocated by the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] concerning Iraqi regime change, the [[Iraq War]], and [[hard-line]] attitudes toward Iran.&lt;ref name=lobe /&gt;&lt;ref name="cohler-esses"&gt;Cohler-Esses, Larry [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060703/cohleresses ''Bunkum From Benador’'], The Nation, July 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, Benador had closed Benador Associates and opened a new firm, Benador Public Relations.

==Career==
Benador studied linguistics, psychology and political science at the [[Sorbonne]] and the [[Université Catholique de Lille]]{{when|date=September 2012}}.  Following university, she worked as an editor for the Peruvian Times and as a translator at the United Nations in Vienna.&lt;ref name=hagan&gt;Hagan, Joe, [http://www.observer.com/node/47358 ''She's Richard Perle's Oyster''], The New York Observer, April 6, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, Benador joined the [[Middle East Forum]], an American conservative&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar, Neil, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/14/washington/14cair.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin ''Scrutiny Increases for a Group Advocating for Muslims in U.S.''] The New York Times, March 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[think tank]], to work as the associate director of, and in charge of the expansion of, the Middle East Forum in New York, and she also was the media liaison of its founder [[Daniel Pipes]]. Benador left the MEF after eighteen months because of conflicts with Pipes.&lt;ref name=hagan /&gt; According to Pipes, they came to a mutual and amicable "understanding that she would do better on her own."&lt;ref name=hagan /&gt;

In October 2001, Benador began her own public relations firm, Benador &amp; Associates. After signing former C.I.A. director [[James Woolsey]] and ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' columnist [[A.M. Rosenthal]], Benador's firm built a clientele of  American neo-conservatives. Benador was criticized for "acting as a kind of public-relations firm for the war."&lt;ref name=hagan /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, Brian [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/feb/24/worlddispatch.usa ''Conflict and catchphrases''], The Guardian, February 24, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, Benador was appointed Goodwill Ambassador of the Shomron (Samaria) Liaison Office in the U.S. and Europe. In that capacity, she addressed the Rally in Support of Israel across the Israel Consulate in New York City, offering proportional comparison by population of the United States to the numbers of Israeli victims of terrorist attacks; according to Benador the 1,200 Israelis victimized from 2000 to 2010 would correspond to 50,297 Americans, while the 8,342 wounded would compare to 350,000.&lt;ref&gt;Domnitch, Larry, [http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/143189 ''New York rally: Israel has rights too ''], Arutz Sheva, March 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Porslins-tallrik med Grillska vapnet.jpg|thumb|275px|Chinese porcelain dish with the Grill coat of arms, imported to Sweden by the SOIC.]]

The '''Grill family''' was one of several Swedish families having significant influence with the [[Swedish East India Company]] (SOIC). During the 17th century, 18th century and for some years into the 19th century, they owned [[ironworks]] and mills manufacturing goods for export while operating wharfs, textile companies, saw mills and other factories related to shipbuilding. Several Grills were directors of the SOIC and the Grill firm traded with the merchants in Canton (now known as [[Guangzhou]]) as members of the SOIC and privately. The Grills owned houses, manors and estates at a number of locations in Sweden.

All the noted Grills were in some way connected to the main Grill Trading House, and several other companies were established in association with the Trading House. The Grill name was kept and passed on through the generations and some of the Grills even shared the same first name.

Apart from the SOIC, the Grills are most noted for their contribution to the Swedish [[Ferrous metallurgy|iron industry]] and for exports of iron during the 18th century.

Originating in [[Genoa]], Italy,&lt;ref name=Grilliana /&gt; part of the family moved to [[Augsburg]], Germany where on 29{{nbsp}}July 1571, Andreas Grill received [[burgher arms]] with their own [[coat of arms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=En praktfull ostindisk servis med det grillska vapnet|trans-title=A splendid East India tableware with the Grill coat of arms|url=http://www.digitaltmuseum.se/things/en-praktfull-ostindisk-servis-med-det/S-NM/NMA.0029080|website=www.digitaltmuseum.se|publisher=Digitalt Museum—[[Nordic Museum]]|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grilliana – En sida om släkten Grill|trans-title=Grillology – A page about the Grill family|url=http://grilliana.wordpress.com/historia/vapenbrevet/|website=www.grilliana.wordpress.com|publisher=The Grill family|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

The name Grill comes from the Italian ''Grillo'', meaning cricket, while the family's coat of arms displays a crane holding a cricket in its beak.{{efn|Shield:Or, standing on a triple mount sable, a crane holding a cricket on its beak proper.&lt;ref name=Familj325&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ett fosterländskt Bildergalleri. |trans-title=A patriotic picture gallery. |last=Schöldström |first=Birger |journal=Svenska Familj-Journalen |year=1879 |publisher=Svenska Familj-Journalen via Project Runeberg | url=http://runeberg.org/famijour/1879/0329.html |volume=18 |pages=325–327 |language=Swedish |location=Stockholm }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The family came to Sweden with the arrival of the silversmith Anthoni Grill (I), grandson of Andreas Grill, born in Augsburg and from 1638, a [[Burgess (title)|burgess]] in [[Amsterdam]]. He was the ''Riksguardie'' (National Appraiser) for the [[Myntverket]] in 1658 to 1667, where he supervised the making of coins and made sure that [[measurement]]s were standardized throughout Sweden. He was not especially good at his work and in 1663, he was demoted to handle smaller goods in gold and silver. He was succeeded at the Myntverket by his son Anthoni Grill (II), who also bought the Grill house at [[Stortorget]] in Stockholm.&lt;ref name=biografiskt&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title =Grill, släkt |trans-title=Grill, family| encyclopedia =[[Svenskt biografiskt lexikon]] | year =1967–1969 |publisher =[[National Archives of Sweden]] |location =Stockholm |language=Swedish |volume=17 |page=276 |url =http://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/artikel/13191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 18th century the family was described as members of the ''Skeppsbroadeln'' (the Skeppsbro Nobility).&lt;ref name=Goteborg /&gt; The name was coined during the 18th century and referred to the wealthiest merchant families in Stockholm at that time, especially those who lived by the quays along the [[Skeppsbron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skeppsbroadeln|trans-title=Skeppsbro nobility|url=http://www.ne.se/skeppsbroadeln|website=www.ne.se|publisher=''[[Nationalencyklopedin]]''|language=Swedish|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family consisted of two branches —the [[Garphyttan]] branch and the [[Godegård]] branch. The Grill family is included in the ''[[Ointroducerad Adels Förening]]'' (Association of the Unintroduced Nobility), an association for Swedish citizens whose family was ennobled in a foreign country, as well as some families who were ennobled in Sweden but for some reason never introduced at the Swedish House of Nobility.&lt;ref name=Leos&gt;{{cite book|last1=Müller|first1=Leos|title=The merchant houses of Stockholm, c. 1640–1800: a comparative study of early-modern entrepreneurial behaviour|date=1998|publisher=Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis|location=Uppsala|isbn=91-554-4233-1|series=Studia historica Upsaliensia, 0081-6531 ; 188Studia historica Upsaliensia, 0081-6531 ; 188|id={{LIBRIS|8359550}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abraham Grill (I) &lt;small&gt;the Elder&lt;/small&gt; ==

[[File:1674-1725-abraham-grill-da.jpg|thumb|Abraham Grill (I) &lt;small&gt;the Elder&lt;/small&gt;.]]
'''Abraham Grill''' (1674{{snd}}20 March 1725) was a Swedish merchant. Married three times, he had seven children&lt;ref name=Grilliana /&gt; and was the son of Anthoni (II) as well as heir to the Grill family fortune, which he increased through trade speculation. During the [[Great Northern War]] led by King [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]], he gave large sums of money to the state and during a time of famine he sold grains at reduced price to the needy. He was also the driving force behind the founding of a house for poor elderly widows in Stockholm on 14{{nbsp}}July 1724.&lt;ref name=Nordisk&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title =Grill | encyclopedia =[[Nordisk familjebok]]–Uggleupplagan |editor1=Meijer Bernhard |editor2=Westrin Theodor |editor3=Berg Ruben G:son |editor4=Söderberg Verner |editor5=Fahlstedt Eugène | year =1909 | publisher =Nordisk familjeboks förl. | url=http://runeberg.org/nfbj/0178.html | pp=303–304 | location =Stockholm | language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1716, he and his brother Carlos Grill, founded the Grill [[Joint-stock company|Trading House]]. The house traded mainly in [[wrought iron]] and became one of the leading trading houses in Stockholm during the 18th century.&lt;ref name=tradinghouse&gt;{{cite web|title=Handelshuset Carlos &amp; Claes Grill (1716–1799)|trans-title=The Carlos &amp; Claes Grill Trading House (1716–1799)|url=http://sok.riksarkivet.se/?Sokord=Abraham+Grill&amp;FacettFilter=arkis_aukt_huvudkategori_facet%24F%C3%B6retag%3A&amp;page=1&amp;postid=Arkis+2BD0C626-62E9-471D-8C01-967559000D04&amp;s=TARKIS08_Siv|website=www.riksarkivet.se/|publisher=[[National Archives of Sweden]]|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its first year the company bought [[Land reclamation|reclaimed land]], from the Countess Elisabeth Oxenstierna, in the east part of Stockholm. The land was used to establish the Terra Nova Wharf,{{efn|''Terra Nova'' is Latin for "new land" and refers to the reclaimed land it was built upon.{{sfn|Zethelius|1956|p=59}}}} also known as the ''Köpmannavarvet'' (the Merchants Wharf),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strandvägshamnen|trans-title=Port at Strandvägen|url=http://www.stockholmshamnar.se/Historia/Platser/Stockholm/Strandvagshamnen/|website=www.stockholmshamnar.se|publisher=Stockholms Hamn|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a number of the ships for the SOIC were built.{{sfn|Zethelius|1956|p=59}}

When Abraham died in 1725, his share of the Trading House went to his son Claes (I). At the death of Carlos in 1736, Claes (I) was sole owner of the company until his half-brother Johan Abraham joined him as partner. Johan Abraham continued to run the Trading House after Claes (I)'s death in 1767. In 1799, Johan Abraham died and the company went bankrupt.&lt;ref name=tradinghouse /&gt;

== Abraham Grill (II) &lt;small&gt;the Younger&lt;/small&gt; ==

'''Abraham Grill''' (28 January 1707{{snd}}28 January 1768) was the brother of Anthoni (III) and Claes (I), and half-brother to Johan Abraham.&lt;ref name=Grilliana /&gt; He started his career as Swedish [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in [[Helsingør]] in 1733 to 1736.&lt;ref name=biografiskt /&gt; During his time in Denmark he met Anna Maria Petersen, and they were married in 1735. They had thirteen children of which five died at an early age.&lt;ref name=Grilliana /&gt;

Abraham and his family moved to Gothenburg in 1746, where he established a trading house. That year, he was also one of the directors for the SOIC during the second charter.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=165}} He cooperated closely with the two other trading houses in the Grill family at that time: Carlos &amp; Claes Grill in Stockholm and Anthony &amp; Johannes Grill in Amsterdam. Abraham's trading house handled most of the copper exported from Gothenburg during a few years in the 1760s. The company also exported iron and tea, brought to Gothenburg by the SOIC.&lt;ref name=Goteborg&gt;{{cite web|last=Svensson|first=Anders|title=Abraham Grill|url=http://gamlagoteborg.se/2014/05/18/abraham-grill/|website=gamlagoteborg.se|publisher=Det Gamla Göteborg|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Abraham's many children, Lorentz Grill, became his partner in the trading house in 1761. At the death of Abraham (on his birthday) in 1768, Lorentz sought out new partners and continued running the company.&lt;ref name=Goteborg /&gt;

== Johan Abraham Grill ==

[[File:Paret Grill.jpg|thumb|320px|Johan Abraham Grill and Christina Elisabeth Grill]]
'''Johan Abraham Grill''' (1719{{snd}}16 March 1799) was a Swedish merchant and politician. He was the son of Abraham (I), &lt;small&gt;the Elder&lt;/small&gt;, and Katarina Rozelius, half-brother to Claes (I) and uncle to Jean Abraham.&lt;ref name=Nordisk /&gt; He married Christina Elisabeth Fischer (1731–1805). It was Johan Abraham who introduced a motto for the Grill family: ''Ärlighet warar längst'' (Honesty is the best policy.).&lt;ref name=Grilliana /&gt;

In 1747, Johan Abraham became partner in the Grill Trading House. Throughout his career he held a number of official positions and received several awards. In 1763, he became a board member in the ''Jernkontoret'' (The Iron Trade Association), established in 1747, it is the oldest [[trade association]] in Sweden.&lt;ref name=SBHClaes /&gt; In 1767, he was a member of the ''Sjöförsäkringsrätten'' (The Naval Insurance Court) where he handled disputes related to shipping that could not be settled in any other way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kungl.

Johan Abraham was a member of the [[Hats (party)|hat party]] and helped finance the Swedish court and the hats activity in the [[Riksdag]] 1771–72, especially in connection to King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]]'s coup d'état on 19{{nbsp}}August 1772, whereby the king's power was solidified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Gustav III |editor=Gunnar Carlquist |encyclopedia=Svensk uppslagsbok |year=1932 |publisher=Baltiska förl. |location=Malmö |id={{LIBRIS|1335380}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money for the coup had to be smuggled out from the Grill House in Stockholm, to the Royal castle in double bottom, wooden troughs filled with mortar.&lt;ref name=SBHClaes /&gt;

'''Claes Grill''' (19 April 1705{{snd}}6 November 1767) was a Swedish merchant and factory owner. Claes was the son of Abraham (I) Grill and Helena Wittmark and twin brother to Anthoni Grill. Claes married his uncle's daughter, Anna Johanna (I) Grill (1720–1778), a woman famed for her beauty. They had two children, a daughter named Anna Johanna (II) 1745–1801) and Adolf Ulric.&lt;ref name=Grilliana&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grill|first1=Johan Wilhelm|last2=Grillo Ankarswärd|first2=Karl|title=Conceptbok till Grillska släktens historia|trans-title=The Grill family history|url=http://grilliana.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/jw-grills-kronika1.pdf|date=1951|location=Godegård|publisher=Mårten Persson|language=Swedish|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early years ===
Claes started to work for his father and at the age of 17 when he was employed at Abrahams office in the Grill Trading House. After the death of Abraham (I), Claes became director of the Trading House, and ran the company together with his uncle Carlos. The name of the company was changed to ''Carlos &amp; Claes Grill'', at that time one of the largest trading company in Sweden. After the death of Carlos in 1736, he was sole head of the firm until 1747, when his half-brother joined him as partner.&lt;ref name=SBHClaes&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Grill, Klas |editor-first=Herman |editor-last=Hofberg |encyclopedia=[[Svenskt biografiskt handlexikon]] |year=1906 |publisher=Svenskt biografiskt handlexikon via [[Project Runeberg]] | url=http://runeberg.org/sbh/a0402.html |volume=1 |pages=402–403 |language=Swedish |location=Stockholm |accessdate=20 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the family had connections to the [[Netherlands]], Claes went there in 1731 or 1732, to further his education and gain more experience with the trading business.&lt;ref name=Claes&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Hildebrand |first1=Bengt|last2=Högberg|first2=Staffan|title =Claes Grill| encyclopedia =[[Svenskt biografiskt lexikon]] | year =1967–1969

=== The Grill Trading House ===
During the mid 18th century, the Grill Trading House flourished both in Sweden and abroad. They were connected to hundreds of trading houses in Europe. Foremost was the export of goods to [[Hamburg]], Amsterdam and England. The Dutch Grill company, Antoni Grill &amp; Sons based in Amsterdam acted as a centre for payments to the Grill trading house in Stockholm. The Anglo-Swedish company run by Andrew &amp; Charles Lindegren in London handled all the exports, shipping documents, vessel clearances, and insurance for the Grill Trading House. They also supplied Swedish ships with transit cargoes from England to the countries around the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref name=Claes /&gt;

During the second charter of the SOIC between 1746 and 1766, the Grill Trading House was one of the leading companies in the East India trade. They were partners in a large linen and rigging factory as well as a glass factory in Stockholm. They leased the Stora Stads wharf in Stockholm, owned the Terra Nova wharf and had interests in the Djurgården wharf. All three wharfs built ships for both the SOIC and foreign customers.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=131}}

The Grill Trading House also ran a banking business for Swedes traveling abroad. Since the company was connected to so many other trading houses, they could issue [[Negotiable instrument|bills of exchange]] for travelers and diplomats to be redeemed at trading houses in other countries. Under the direction of Claes, the trading house acquired several factories and ironworks: Söderfors 1748, Österbybruk with the [[Dannemora mine]] (1750) and [[Iggesund, Hudiksvall|Iggesund]] (1753). The main exports from these factories were iron, copper, [[lumber]] and [[tar]]. Imports consisted of salt from [[Portugal]], oak and [[hemp]] from the [[Baltic states]], also wine, coffee, sugar, cheese, tobacco and textiles.&lt;ref name=Leos /&gt; Claes ran his companies in an old-fashioned, patriarchal way writing letters every week to his managers at the estates concerning everything from the running of the factories to making enquiries about individual employees. Overall, the Grills industrial companies employed more than 4,000 persons at that time.&lt;ref name=Claes /&gt;

=== Houses and estates ===

[[File:Svindersvik 2009h.jpg|thumb|Svindersvik, interior]]
With the building of the manor in Österbybruk, it became the hub for all the iron and mining activities of the Grill Trading House, although Claes and his family did not live there permanently. They lived in the Grill house in Stockholm until 1764, when he bought the Torstensonska Palace (now known as the [[Arvfurstens palats]]) at [[Gustav Adolfs torg, Stockholm]]. The summers were spent at [[Svindersvik]], a country residence outside Stockholm, built by Claes in the early 1740s.&lt;ref name=Claes /&gt;

Claes was an art collector and his houses were decorated with [[Chinese art|Chinese]] objects as well as paintings by Swedish and Dutch masters like [[Alexander Roslin]], [[Gustaf Lundberg]], [[Hans Memling]] and [[David Teniers the Younger|David Teniers]]. He owned six complete sets of [[porcelain]] tableware commissioned from Canton. {{As of|2014}}, the oldest and largest of these still has 325 pieces preserved.&lt;ref name=Claes /&gt; Imported porcelain broken in transit from [[Qing dynasty|China]] or by daily household use became decorative gravel used on the garden paths at one of the Grills' estates. This example of wasting money and resources was condemned by those who opposed the activities of the SOIC. Even noted botanist [[Carl Linnaeus]] was at first an opponent. He wrote: "A part of the silver, which withstands the wear and tear of time and which even fire cannot destroy, we exchange for fragile objects of clay, which, once dropped, cannot be mended."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roth|first1=Stig|title=Chinese porcelain: imported by the Swedish East India Company|date=1965|publisher=Historiska Museet|location=Göteborg|page=24|id={{LIBRIS|1520976}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefactor ===

Claes was interested in [[natural science]] and contributed to different projects, such as helping Carl Linnaeus financially and with the collection of plants and animal specimens from foreign lands. In 1740, he became a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. He gave financial support to young scientists and naturalists, lent money (without interest) to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for the construction of an observatory, contributed a substantial sum of money to the [[Danviken Hospital]] and saved the [[Sveriges Riksbank]] (the [[central bank]] of Sweden) from bankruptcy in 1747 by buying banknotes at their nominal value. In 1748, he became ''[[Praeses|preses]]'' or president of the Royal Academy of Sciences and was elected to the board of directors at the central bank of Sweden, a position he held until 1756.{{efn|In his speech at the Academy on 4{{nbsp}}February 1749, Claes (I) spoke on the use of shipping. In his speech he summed up the ships owned by shipping companies in Stockholm in 1749: "Ships made of oak: 62 ships up to and including 100 ''lästs'', 16 ships up to 200 ''lästs'', 4 ships up to 300 ''lästs''. Ships made of pine: 63 ships up to and including 100 ''lästs'', 31 ships up to 200 ''lästs'', 13 ships up to 300 ''lästs'' and 3 over 300 ''lästs''." {{sfn|Zethelius|1956|p=96}}}} Claes was also awarded the honorary title of ''kommerseråd'' ("trade counselor") by [[Adolf Frederick, King of Sweden|King Adolf Frederick]]. In 1755, he was one of the initiating founders of the Factory Academy, a social network for factory owners in central Sweden.&lt;ref name=SBHClaes /&gt;

=== Political life and fall ===
Between 1748 and 1750, Claes was a member of the [[Bourgeoisie]] in the [[Riksdag of the Estates]] and politically involved with the [[Hats (party)|Hats]]. He was also one of the partners in the infamous ''Växelkontoret'' (Exchange office), a private financial institution handling mainly [[promissory note]]s without the involvement of the central bank. When the [[Caps (party)|Caps]] became the ruling party in 1765, Claes, along with his half-brother Johan Abraham and all the other members of the ''Växelkontoret'', were accused of corruption and mishandling its affairs. In 1765, Claes and Johan Abraham, were fined by the Justice deputation of the Riksdag, and in 1766, they were sentenced to pay back "five barrels of gold" to the ''Växelkontoret''. When the Hats regained their political power in the Riksdag the following year, the sentence was revoked, but by then Claes had died.&lt;ref name=SBHClaes /&gt;

=== Ironworks owner ===
Adolf Ulric was a dedicated and hands-on owner of the ironworks at Söderfors, who supervised the operation and managed the books. Initially the factory's main products were anchors but with additions and improvements to the facilities he expanded into the production of wrought and pig iron amongst other goods. The products from the ironworks were of good quality and production peaked in 1780.&lt;ref name=Soder /&gt;

=== Collector ===
[[File:Uppstoppad häst. Hertig Fredrik Adolf - Livrustkammaren - 86954.tif|thumb|upright|Mounted horse from the Grill collection at Söderfors, now in the ''[[Livrustkammaren]]'']]
Like his father, he was a [[Natural science|natural scientist]] and he collected [[Taxidermy|mounted animals]], fossils, [[mineral]]s and plants in a museum, started in 1783, at the Söderfors manor. The first specimens were collected in the vicinity of Söderfors. After two years Adolf Ulric moved on to the birds of the archipelago. He was able to use his connections through his relatives in the trading houses, to send for specimens from [[Greenland]] and [[Qing dynasty|China]]. The collections were also increased during his travels and on a journey to England in 1788, he traded a mounted [[moose]] for 60 rare birds.&lt;ref name=Ulric /&gt;

In 1786, Adolf Ulric built a separate house at the manor for the [[Zoology|zoological]] collection. At that time it contained 116 mounted [[mammal]]s, 600 birds, 700 [[seashell]]s and 39 fishes. The collection was displayed as a full size [[diorama]], the centerpiece being a cliff with mounted [[lion]]s, [[tiger]]s with cubs, [[leopard]]s and a number of other animals surrounding the cliff, the largest being a [[sirenia]]. The museum was the largest collection in the [[Nordic countries]] at that time, it also received some international recognition. In 1793, Adolf Ulric became a member, and ''preses'' in 1795, of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for his work with the museum. In 1828, the collection was donated to the Academy by the Grill family.&lt;ref name=Ulric /&gt; As a tribute to him, the [[giant oarfish]] (''Gymnetrus Grillii''),{{efn|The name was given in 1798, and has since been altered to ''Regalecus glesne''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Froese|first1=Rainer|title=Synonyms of Regalecus glesne Ascanius, 1772|url=http://www.fishbase.org/Nomenclature/SynonymsList.php?ID=3267&amp;SynCode=30575&amp;GenusName=Regalecus&amp;SpeciesName=glesne|website=www.fishbase.org|publisher=FishBase|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} was named after him.&lt;ref name=Nordisk /&gt;

== Mariedamm ==
[[File:Trehörnings masugn, Mariedamm.jpg|thumb|120px|The Trehörnings blast furnace]]
The Trehörnings blast furnace in Mariedamm was originally built by local miners in 1636. Louis De Geer bought it in 1648, and it became part of the Godegårds ironworks which was sold on to Jean Abraham in 1775. The blast furnace remained a part of the Grill's estate at Godegård until 1888, when it was sold to the [[Skyllbergs bruk]]. The blast furnace was in operation until 1889. Since 1923, it is in being cared for and renovated by the Lerbäck Heritage society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trehörnings masugn|trans-title=The Trehörnings blast furnace|url=http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/orebro/Sv/samhallsplanering-och-kulturmiljo/byggnadsvard/kulturmiljo/sevarda-kulturmiljoer/askersund/trehornings-masugn/Pages/index.aspx|website=www.lansstyrelsen.se|publisher=Länsstyrelsen Örebro län|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 19th century, a mansion was built in Mariedamm by the Grill family.

== Garphyttan ==
[[File:Garphytte bruk.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Administration building at Garphyttan.]]
The mining at Garphyttan was started during the Middle Ages by German miners. These were called "garps", a medieval Swedish word meaning "loudmouths" or "braggers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Garp |encyclopedia=[[Nordisk familjebok]] |year=1908|publisher=[[Project Runeberg]] |location=Stockholm|volume=9|pages=764–4|url=http://runeberg.org/nfbi/0400.html|language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main product was lead ore which also contained silver, but the yield from the ore was small and business faltered a number of times during the 17th century and early 18th century. It was not until the factory was bought by three Dutch merchants in 1661, that the company started to flourish again. A trip hammer, two hearths, a smithy, a saw mill, a silver refinery and housing for the workers were added. The factories and the ironworks went through several owners until 1773, when Abraham (III) acquired them all. The previous owner had borrowed money from the Anthony Grill &amp; Sons Trading House in Amsterdam, and when he failed to repay the loan, the factories became the property of the Grills. The building of a manor at Garphyttan started during the 17th century, and several additions were made in the middle of the 18th century. The main building of the manor was destroyed during a fire in 1830, only the four wings remain.&lt;ref name=Garp&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nachmanson|first1=August|last2=Hannerberg|first2=David|title=Garphyttan: ett gammalt bruks historia|trans-title=Garphyttan: the history of an old orinworks|date=1945|publisher=Bonnier|location=Stockholm|id={{LIBRIS|26310}}|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stora Nyckelviken ==
[[File:Nyckelviken herrgård 2011.jpg|thumb|120px|The Nyckelviken manor, main building]]
Stora Nyckelviken manor was completed in 1746 by Herman Petersen, a wealthy merchant and director of the SOIC. The manor was designed in much the same style as the other manors built with the profits from the East India trade. It consists of a main building, wings, gazebos and a park. The manor was only owned by the Grill family for a short period of time. Jean Abraham Grill bought it in 1760, and sold it 20 years later.&lt;ref name=Grill-houses /&gt; {{As of|2014}} the manor is owned by the municipality of Nacka. It houses a restaurant and a conference venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stora Nyckelviken|url=http://www.stockholmslansmuseum.se/upptack_lanet/visa/b041/|website=www.stockholmslansmuseum.se|publisher=Stockholms läns museum|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Skebo and Ortala ==
[[File:Swedish castle Skebo bruk Sweden.JPG|thumb|left|120px|The Skebo manor]]
[[File:Ortala bruk.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Coal storage at the Ortala ironworks]]
The first ironworks in Skebo was built in the 15th century. The iron ore was mined locally in the forests surrounding the factory. The first smithy with a trip hammer at Skebo, was constructed by Hindrich Lemmens in 1626. The iron from the ironworks was mainly sold to the Norrtälje rifle factory, which made weapons used in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. During the 18th century the Skebo and Ortala (a similar mine and factory nearby) ironworks were operated jointly. They went through several owners, due to the economical entanglements and financial difficulties of the directors and investors. One of these affairs resulted in Jacob Grill obtaining Skebo and Ortala, along with three other factories in 1769, from the previous owner who could not pay his debt to Jacob.&lt;ref name=Grill-houses /&gt; Jacob had no experience in operating an ironworks, he got into financial difficulties and had to sell the factories in 1782. The ironworks flourished during the 19th century, and began to decline after 1900, ending in bankruptcy in 1924.&lt;ref name=Skebo&gt;{{cite web|title=Ett av Upplands äldsta järnbruk|trans-title=One of the oldest ironworks in Uppland|url=http://www.skebobruksmuseum.se/html/skebo_bruks_historia.html|website=www.skebobruksmuseum.se|publisher=Skebobruks Museum|accessdate=28 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127031212/http://skebobruksmuseum.se/html/skebo_bruks_historia.html|archivedate=27 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time at Skebo, Jacob built a manor in 1767–1770. During the 19th century the new owners filled it with art and sculptures and it became a center for the local socialite. When the ironworks folded the manor became a retirement home for elderly gentlemen, a spa, a house for seminars and workshops, and in 2010, a noted restaurant listed in the White Guide 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detta har hänt|trans-title=The story so far|url=http://skeboherrgard.se/om_oss/historik|website=skeboherrgard.se|publisher=Skebo Herrgård|accessdate=28 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230234227/http://skeboherrgard.se/om_oss/historik|archivedate=30 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2013}}, the restaurant is closed and the manor is a temporary lodging for refugees seeking asylum in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersson|first1=Ki|title=Skebo herrgård tillfällig bostad för flyktingar|trans-title=Skebo manor temporary home for refugees|url=http://norrteljetidning.se/nyheter/nyheter/1.2260799-skebo-herrgard-tillfallig-bostad-for-flyktingar|website=norrteljetidning.se|publisher=Norrtelje Tidning|accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Lövåsen lead and silver factory ==
[[File:Sockensten Stora Skedvi 50-1.jpg|thumb|120px|Marker at Stora Skedvi]]

The Lövåsen lead and silver factory in Stora Skedvi was one of the first factories to be connected with the Grill family. The Swedish government handed over the administration of the factory to Anthoni Grill (I) in 1656, to be used as a laboratory and workshop by him. He had claimed that he was in possession of a secret "matter" that would enable him to extract much more copper, lead, silver and gold from the ore than by other conventional methods. He experimented fore some years at the laboratory, but he never improved the extraction process, and was consequently demoted from his position at the mine. {{As of|2014}}, there are no visible remains of the mine or the factory.&lt;ref name=biografiskt /&gt;

== Ersta ==
[[File:Ersta 2009e.jpg|thumb|120px|left|The Ersta manor]]
Ersta is one of the many ''malmgårdarna'' (suburban manors) built in Stockholm during the 17th and 18th century. At these manors, wealthy, noble families from different parts of Sweden, could enjoy the same comforts as in their homes in the country. The manors were built in the suburbs, close to what constituted Stockholm in the 17th century and 18th century. The city has grown considerably since then, and these locations are now considered to be part of central Stockholm. Many of the buildings, the entire manor or part of them, are still in use and embedded in the modern cityscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindberg|first1=Birgit|title=Malmgårdarna i Stockholm|trans-title=The suburban manors of Stockholm|date=1985|publisher=LiberFörlag|location=Stockholm|isbn=91-38-90418-7|page=16|id={{LIBRIS|7268833}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ersta, on the high cliffs of southern Stockholm, was probably built in the 1670s by [[brännvin]] manufacturer Oluf Håkansson. At that time the land in that area was cheap since it was close to the old gallows. When the gallows was moved further away from town to make way for a new shipyard, the Stora Stads wharf, where ships for the SOIC were built, the area around Ersta became sought after and was called "a garden". The mansion passed through several owners until Jean Abraham Grill bought it in 1755. In 1770, he established a [[crucible steel]] factory at Ersta with the help of [[Bengt Andersson Qvist]], a member of the [[Swedish Board of Mines]]. Members of the Qvist family were inspectors at the Iggesund ironworks.&lt;ref name=Grill-houses /&gt; The steel was of good quality, but nevertheless unprofitable. In 1775, Jean Abraham sold the manor and the steel factory to Qvist who ran the company until it folded with his death in 1799.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindberg|first1=Birgit|title=Malmgårdarna i Stockholm|trans-title=Suburban manors of Stockholm|date=1985|publisher=LiberFörlag|location=Stockholm|isbn=91-38-90418-7|pages=45–48|id={{LIBRIS|7268833}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2014}}, only two of the buildings at the manor remain. They are a part of the Ersta Hospital and one of them houses the Ersta museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hur staden på berget växte fram|trans-title=How the city on the mountain came to be|url=http://www.erstadiakoni.se/Erstamuseum/Staden-pa-berget/Hur-staden-pa-berget-vaxte-fram/|website=www.erstadiakoni.se|publisher=Ersta diakoni|accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4607">'''ISO 20022''' is an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] [[technical standard|standard]] for [[electronic data interchange]] between [[financial institution]]s. It describes a metadata repository containing descriptions of messages and business processes, and a maintenance process for the repository content.  The standard covers financial information transferred between financial institutions that includes payment transactions, securities trading and settlement information, [[credit card|credit]] and [[debit card]] transactions and other financial information.

The repository contains a huge amount of financial services metadata that has been shared and standardized across the industry. The metadata is stored in [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] models with a special ISO 20022 UML Profile. Underlying all of this is the ISO 20022 metamodel - a model of the models. The UML profile is the metamodel transformed into UML. The metadata is transformed into the syntax of messages used in financial networks. The first syntax supported for messages was XML Schema.

ISO 20022 is widely used in financial services. Organizations participating in ISO 20022 include: [[Financial Information eXchange|FIX Protocol Limited]] ([[Financial Information eXchange]]), [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association|ISDA]] ([[FpML]]), [[ISITC]], [[Omgeo]], [[SWIFT]], and [[Visa Inc.|Visa]].

ISO 20022 is the successor to [[ISO 15022]]; originally ISO 20022 was called ISO 15022 2nd Edition. ISO 15022 was the successor of [[ISO 7775]].

== Management of the standard ==
* The Standard is issued by [[ISO Technical Committee 68]] ([[TC68]]), which is responsible for Financial Services in ISO.
* The Standard is managed by [[Working Group 4]] (WG4), a sub-group of TC68 whose charter is "the management of ISO 20022".
* The Standard defines a Repository Management Group (RMG) Composed of senior industry experts. It is the highest registration body.
* SEG Standard Evolution Group composed of industry experts in specific business domains of the financial industry
* [[SWIFT]] is the Registration Authority for ISO 20022. RA is the guardian of the ISO 20022 financial repository.

== Adoption ==
A 2015 report by the United States's [[Federal Reserve System]] classified Europe having "mature adopters" of ISO 20022; [[India]], [[South Africa]], [[Japan]], [[Singapore]], and [[Switzerland]] as having "growing adopters"; and [[Australia]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[New Zealand]] as having "interested adopters". The report concluded that the Federal Reserve should push for ISO 20022 adoption within the United States financial system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Strategies for improving the U.S. payment system|url = https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/wp-content/uploads/strategies-improving-us-payment-system.pdf|website = |accessdate = 2015-05-16|publisher = [[Federal Reserve System]]|date = 26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Infinitum AS''', former Norsk Resirk AS, is a corporation that operates the national paid recycling scheme for bottles and cans marked with the official "recyclable" or "[[Container deposit legislation|deposit]]" (Pant in Norwegian) logo in Norway. The beverages containers included in the program are the ones made of aluminum, steel and plastic (PET) produced in or imported to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Infinitum - Geelmuyden Kiese|url=http://gknordic.com/case/infinitum/|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deposit scheme for certain one-way containers is mandatory in Norway by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulations relating to the recycling of waste in Norway (English-translated title)|url=https://lovdata.no/dokument/SF/forskrift/2004-06-01-930|website=lovdata.no|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was established in 1999 and is owned by companies and organizations in beverage industry and food trading (giant chain stores). The company aims to ensure the highest possible return in deposit recycling packaging for beverages at the lowest cost and environmental impact, for the time being, Infinitum managed to reach 95% return rate for one-way containers in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More empty bottles and cans are being recycled (English-translated title)|url=http://www.miljodirektoratet.no/no/Nyheter/Nyheter/Old-klif/2013/juni-2013/Flere-tomflasker-og-bokser-gjenvinnes/|website=www.miljodirektoratet.no|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Discover Scuba Diving -- St. Croix, US Virgin Islands.jpg|thumb|Discover Scuba Diving in St. Croix, US Virgin Islands]]
'''Introductory diving''', also known as '''trial diving''' and '''resort diving''' are dives where people without diver training or certification can experience [[scuba diving]] under the guidance of a recreational [[diving instructor]].&lt;ref name="Schnuppertauchen" /&gt; Introductory diving is an opportunity for interested people to find out by practical experience if they would be interested in greater involvement in scuba diving.&lt;ref name="dsd2" /&gt; For scuba instructors and diving schools is it an opportunity to acquire new customers. An introductory diving experience is much less time-consuming and costly than the completion of [[autonomous diver]] training, but has little lasting value, as it is an experience program only, for which no certification is issued. Introductory scuba diving experiences are intended to introduce people to recreational diving, and increase the potential client base of dive shops to include people who do not have the time or inclination to complete an entry level certification program.

== Procedure ==
[[File:PADI-Ausbildungssystem.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|PADI education system]]
Participants are usually required to read and sign waivers to minimise liability of the program provider, and to provide a declaration that they do not suffer from any medical condition listed that would be an unacceptable risk for diving. Prior to the dive itself, an instructor teaches essential theoretical knowledge, so that the participants can dive with a low level of risk, and with informed consent. After putting on the necessary [[diving equipment]], the participant enters the water under close supervision of the instructor. First of all, breathing from the [[Diving regulator|scuba regulator]] is practiced at the water surface. At shallow water depth, some scuba skills are learned: Clearing the [[diving mask]], removing the regulator from the mouth and replacing and clearing it of water. These two skills are essential for the safety of the participants. Afterwards, there may be an opportunity to either play underwater games or explore the surroundings in shallow water. Trial diving usually takes about two to four hours.&lt;ref name="dsd"/&gt;

The participant learns the basic minimum safety guidelines and skills needed to dive under the direct supervision of a diving professional. If an open water dive is included, a few more basic skills will be practiced in confined water. The course includes:&lt;ref name="discover"/&gt;
*Introduction to the scuba equipment used to dive and how to move around underwater using the equipment.
*Breathing underwater on open circuit scuba and how to avoid [[barotrauma]].
*Learning some of the key skills that are used during every scuba dive.
*Swimming around and exploring within the limits of the program and the local environment.
*Information on how to enroll in a training course to become a certified entry-level recreational scuba diver through the providing agency.

=== Venue ===
Usually the introductory diving first takes place in ''[[Underwater diving#Diving environment|confined water]]'', which usually means a [[swimming pool]] or a very shallow and safe place in a [[lake]] or the [[sea]]. Depending on the offer, after the first dive in confined water, a second or further shallow dives may be done in suitable confined or open water.&lt;ref name="dsd2" /&gt;

===Altitude and flying after diving===
{{see also|Decompression practice#Flying and ascent to altitude after diving}}
People can go directly from high altitude to scuba diving, but should not scuba dive then go up in altitude without allowing an interval, depending on the time and depth of the dive, to reduce risk of [[decompression sickness]]. The [[Divers Alert Network]] (DAN) Flying after Diving workshop of 2002 recommended a 12-hour surface interval for uncertified individuals who took part in an introductory scuba experience before flying or ascending to an altitude greater than, or [[cabin pressure]] less than, an altitude equivalent of {{convert|2000|feet|meters}}.&lt;ref name="DAN-FAD 2002" /&gt;

== Prerequisites ==
[[File:CMAS-Ausbildung.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|CMAS education system]]
The diving school may ask that the participants of the trial dive prove their [[medical fitness to dive]] with a medical certificate, but more commonly they will use a standardized form for the participant to declare their self assessment of fitness to dive.

From the age of 8 years it is possible to take part in an introductory dive,&lt;ref name="Schnuppertauchen"/&gt; but some providers require a greater age. The participant should be able to swim at least {{convert|25|m|ft}} without any buoyancy aid.

== Introductory diving programs==
The international standard [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]&amp;nbsp;11121&lt;ref name="ISO-Introductory" /&gt; standardizes the minimum requirements for an "Introductory Training Program". Despite the standardization, the title and contents of the program vary depending on the provider and their membership of a [[List of diver certification organizations|diver certification agency]]. The following programs are based on ISO&amp;nbsp;11121.

=== CMAS ===
The [[Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques|CMAS]] Introductory Scuba Experience participants should be at least 14 years of age and able to swim.&lt;ref name="cmas" /&gt; The "Introductory Scuba Experience" includes a theory lesson, a confined water dive where several diving skills are practiced and an open water dive to a maximum depth of {{convert|10|m}}.

=== NAUI ===
Participants in a [[National Association of Underwater Instructors|NAUI]] Try scuba / Passport Diver program must be at least 10 years old. However, it is possible to take part in a confined water dive from the age of 8 years. The "Try scuba" program includes a theory lesson and a confined water dive where participants practice several dive skills and one or more open water dives. The first open water dive has recommended depth limit of {{convert|6|m}}. For further dives there is a limit of {{convert|12|m}}. Participants who have completed two open water dives will receive an "NAUI Passport Diver" confirmation. It enables them to participate in further open water introductory dives later on, guided by a NAUI instructors, without repeating the confined water dive.&lt;ref name="naui" /&gt;

=== NAUI Tandem Diver ===
The "Tandem Diver" program is an alternative to the "NAUI Try scuba" and differs mainly by the individual supervision of the participant and lack of the opportunities offered by the "NAUI Passport Diver".&lt;ref name="naui" /&gt;

=== PADI ===
[[File:SSI-education system.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|SSI education system]]
Participants in a [[PADI Discover Scuba Diving]] program should be at least 10 years old and should be able to swim.&lt;ref name="padidsd" /&gt; The "Discover Scuba Diving" program includes a theory lesson and a confined water dive where basic diving skills are practiced. Afterwards, one or more directly supervised open water dives can be done to a maximum depth of {{convert|12|m}}. Discover Scuba Diving includes the theoretical content and skills of the first lesson of the [[Open Water Diver|PADI Open Water Diver]] course, and this experience may be credited as the first confined water dive of a PADI [[Open Water Diver]] course if done within for one year,&lt;ref name="dsd" /&gt;

The PADI Discover Scuba Diving course allows for repetitive diving experiences within a time limit at the discretion of the dive instructor and dive shop.  This is a common request for people who try diving, then want to repeat the activity (often at a different location).

=== PADI Bubblemaker ===
The "Bubblemaker" program is a trial dive in the swimming pool for children from 8 years of age. The participants are introduced to scuba diving in a playful way by a scuba instructor.&lt;ref name="padimanual " /&gt; The maximum allowed diving depth is {{convert|2|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref name="padibubblemaker" /&gt;

=== [[Scuba Schools International|SSI]] Try scuba ===
Participants must be at least 8 years old. The "Try scuba" course takes place in confined water and includes a theory session.&lt;ref name="SSI" /&gt; The participant may be submerged to a maximum depth of {{convert|5|m}}.&lt;ref name="SSI"/&gt;

=== SSI Try Scuba Diving ===
Participants must be at least 10 years old. SSI "Try Scuba Diving" is similar to the Try Scuba (Pool) program. The main difference is that it includes an open water dive and can be credited towards an [[Open Water Diver|SSI Open Water Diver]] course later. For open water dives there is a depth limit of {{convert|12|m}}.&lt;ref name="ssitsd" /&gt;

== Other types of introductory diving ==
There are programs for advanced divers that are also called introductory diving. These include programs that allow an experienced diver to try out [[technical diving]],&lt;ref name="tec" /&gt; [[rebreather]],&lt;ref name="Rebreather " /&gt; or [[cave diving]].&lt;ref name="hoehle" /&gt;

'''Leopold Fabius Dietegen Fane de Salis''', (26 April 1816 &amp;ndash; 20 November 1898) was a Tuscan-born Australian pastoralist and politician.&lt;ref&gt;''A genealogical and heraldic History of the Colonial Gentry'', by [[Burke's Peerage|Sir (John) Bernard Burke]], CB, LLD, vol. 2, London, 1895/1899 (pages 574–77).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Burke's Peerage'', Foreign Noblemen / Foreign Titles sections: 1851, 1936, 1956, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LeopoldDeSalis.jpg|thumb|Count ''Leo'' in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;He came to England in 1893, particularly to settle his affairs in Middlesex.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[File:Charlotte MacDonald (d.1878), wife to Leopold F. D. Fane De Salis (1816-1898).jpg|thumbnail|left|Charlotte MacDonald (d.1878).]]
Born in [[Florence]] to [[Jerome, 4th Count de Salis-Soglio]] and Henrietta Foster,&lt;ref&gt;Daughter of [[William Foster (bishop)|Lord Bishop of Clogher, William Foster]].&lt;/ref&gt; he attended [[Eton College]] and studied sheep farming at [[Jedburgh]] in Scotland. In 1840 he migrated to [[Sydney]], where he formed a partnership to run a station at [[Junee, New South Wales|Junee]]. In the same decade, in 1842, 1844 and 1848, his highly capable next elder brother [[William Andrew Salius Fane de Salis|William]] also sailed to Australia. They did much business together.

In 1844 he married Charlotte Macdonald, with whom he had four children, two of whom ([[George De Salis|George]] and [[Leopold William De Salis|Leopold]]) would later become politicians themselves. In 1855 he sold out and bought the [[Cuppacumbalong Homestead|Cuppacumbalong station]] at [[Tharwa, Australian Capital Territory|Tharwa]], later purchasing further property on the [[Murrumbidgee River]]. In 1864 he was elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] for [[Electoral district of Queanbeyan|Queanbeyan]], but he did not re-contest in 1869. In 1872 he was appointed to the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]]. Around this time he also acquired property in [[Queensland]], all of which he lost in the 1890s depression. His daughter Nina married [[William Farrer]] in 1882 and they lived at [[Lambrigg, Tharwa]], a property given them by De Salis. In 1898 he left the Council bankrupt with significant debts. He died at Tharwa later that year.&lt;ref name=nsw&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21745">'''Lorenzo Borgogni''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] businessman who was the longtime director of external relations at Finmeccanica (since 2017 [[Leonardo]]), a partly government-owned entity that is Italy's leading high-tech industrial group and a major international player in aerospace, defense and security, with offices in over 100 countries.&lt;ref name=ibt&gt;{{cite web| last =Rochan| first =M| title =Italian Police Arrest Former Finmeccanica Managers in Waste Probe| work =International Business Time| date =Mar 25, 2014| url =http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/italian-police-arrest-former-finmeccanica-managers-waste-probe-1441685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, in the wake of reports that he was being investigated in a case involving the alleged payment of bribes in connection with Sistri, a waste-tracking system developed by a Finmeccanica subsidiary, Selex Sistemi Integrati, Borgogni left his position at Finnmecanica. In late 2012, Borgogni told Italian prosecutors that [[AgustaWestland]], another subsidiary of Finmeccanica, had paid 51 million euros in kickbacks to win a helicopter contract with the government of [[India]]. These charges led to an international scandal and to extensive investigations by the authorities of both countries.

In 2014, Borgogni was arrested on corruption charges relating to the alleged Selex bribes. The newspaper ''La Repubblica'' described Borgogni as the “Deep Throat” of the AgustaWestland scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Borgogni: "Sarebbe bastato che il governo muovesse un dito. Ma doveva farlo prima"| work =La repubblica| url =http://inchieste.repubblica.it/it/repubblica/rep-it/2013/02/19/news/finmeccanica_borgogni-52892752/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Lorenzo Borgogni is a native and resident of Siena Buonconvento, in [[Tuscany]].&lt;ref name="Libero"&gt;{{cite web| title =Toscana, il governatore Rossi toglie i soldi ai malati per finanziare un film| work =Libero| url =http://www.liberoquotidiano.it/news/italia/1384783/Toscana--il-governatore-Rossi-toglie-i-soldi-ai-malati-per-finanziare-un-film.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Borgogni was the director of external relations at Finmeccanica for nearly 20 years.&lt;ref name=ilsz&gt;{{cite web| last =Giudiziarie| first =Ombre| title =FdI su Giallo Toscana: "La Regione finanzia il filmetto degli inquisiti"| work =Firenze| date =Jan 20, 2014| url =http://www.ilsitodifirenze.it/content/352-fdi-su-giallo-toscana-la-regione-finanzia-il-filmetto-degli-inquisiti#.VFzTop_WkyQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He took part in a meeting in March 2006 in [[Russia]] at which Russian-Italian projects, including the project to develop a Russian regional jet, were discussed. The Russian participants included Presidential aide [[Sergei Eduardovich Prikhodko|Sergei Prikhodko]], Minister for information technology and communications [[Leonid Reiman]], Minister of industry and energy [[Viktor Khristenko]], and Deputy foreign minister [[Aleksandr Grushko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Vladimir Putin met with the president and chairman of the board of directors of the Italian engineering company Finmeccanica, Piero Francesco Guarguaglini| work =President of Russia| date =Mar 30, 2006| url =http://eng.kremlin.ru/news/12828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 article in ''Espresso'' described Borgogni's alleged role in the appointment of persons to the Board of Directors of Finmeccanica, who are technically named by the Italian Treasury. In reality, according to this report, Borgogni would essentially issue orders every year listing officials of various political parties who were to become directors of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =The landslide| work =Espresso| url =http://www.beppegrillo.it/en/2013/02/the_landslide.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selex scandal==
In December 2009, the Finmeccanica subsidiary Selex Sistemi Integrati won a €400m contract to design, deploy, and maintain the Sistri system, which electronically tracks waste transportation and disposal. In 2011, during a struggle over control of the firm between chairman [[Pier Francesco Guarguaglini]] and [[Giuseppi Orsi]], who succeeded him in November of that year, Italian authorities began investigating allegations of bribery in connection with the contract, and concluded that in order to process the bribes, massive slush funds had been established by means of a complex system of false invoicing, several sham firms had been set up in [[Delaware]] and other tax havens, and secret bank accounts had been opened in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=ibt/&gt;&lt;ref name=exp&gt;{{cite web| title =AgustaWestland chopper deal: The insider and the middlemen| work =Indian Express| date =Feb 15, 2013| url =http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/agustawestland-chopper-deal-the-insider-and-the-middlemen/1074487/0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borogni was one of the Finmeccanica officials who were targets of the investigation.

A report in ''The Hindu'' later stated that the “vast” Italian investigation into Finmecannica had begun in Naples as a search “for connections between the mafia, large Italian companies and the Italian government,” and that as part of this investigation, investigators had “recorded the conversations of Lorenzo Borgogni, who at the time was responsible for 'Institutional Relations' (read contacts with government officials and politicians) for Finmeccanica.”&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite web| last =Naravane| first =Vaiju| title =Charge sheet says €100,000 given to Tyagi brothers| work =The Hindu| date =Feb 16, 2013| url =http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/charge-sheet-says-100000-given-to-tyagi-brothers/article4419760.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emiliano Fittipaldi, an investigative journalist for ''Espresso'', later told ''The Hindu'' “It was not surprising that the Naples investigators were digging into Lorenzo Borgogni,” given that as the person responsible for “institutional relations,” “he was a man who knew many secrets.”&lt;ref name=hindu/&gt;

In October 2011, the same month in which two Selex managers were arrested as a result of the probe, Borgogni either was suspended from office by Orsi or resigned his position on orders from Orsi, after various media reported that he was being targeted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Povoledo| first =Elisabetta| title =Scandal at Finmeccanica Revives Questions in Italy| work =New York Times| date =Nov 30, 2011| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/01/business/global/scandal-at-finmeccanica-revives-questions-in-italy.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=panm&gt;{{cite web| title =Finmeccanica, la verità di Lorenzo Borgogni| work =Panorama| url =http://archivio.panorama.it/italia/Finmeccanica-la-verita-di-Lorenzo-Borgogni}}&lt;/ref&gt; “over alleged ethics violations”&lt;ref name=defn&gt;{{cite web| last =Kington| first =Tom| title =Finmeccanica Whistleblower Faces Corruption Probe| work =Defense News| date =Mar 27, 2014| url =http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140327/DEFREG01/303270046/Finmeccanica-Whistleblower-Faces-Corruption-Probe}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had admitted to interrogators in [[Rome]] tho accepting millions of euros from companies that had received contracts from Finmeccanica.

A November 22, 2011, report stated that Guarguaglini denied having “created illegal funds” or “paid or ordered anyone to pay money to politicians or political parties,” and that Borgogni, who had not yet been charged or arrested, claimed not to have done anything illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Castonguay| first =Gilles| title =Pressure Mounts on Finmeccanica| work =Wall Street Journal| date =Nov 22, 2011| url =https://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204531404577053772523993642}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Borgogni was suspended from office, at the request of the CEO Giuseppe Orsi, after newspapers published accounts of his interrogation in Rome, in which he admitted accepting millions of Euros from companies which received contracts from Finmeccanica.&lt;ref name=panm/&gt; Through his lawyer Stephen Bortone, Borgogni said: “I never took bribes or made such a statement to anyone.” Borgogni also asserted that he had never made any accusations about Guarguaglini or his wife, Marina Grossi.&lt;ref name=panm/&gt;

==Helicopter scandal==
{{Main article|2013 Indian helicopter bribery scandal}}

In late 2011, Borgogni began telling Italian investigators about another alleged set of acts of corruption involving India's purchase the previous year of 12 AW101 helicopters for €560 million from Finmeccanica's helicopter unit, AgustaWestland.&lt;ref name=defn/&gt; Borgogni provided them with details of kickbacks supposedly paid to Indian officials via an elaborate process in order to ensure their purchase of the helicopters.&lt;ref name=defn/&gt; Borgogni supplied detailed information regarding the identities of the middlemen and the means by which AgustaWestland had distributed a total of 51 million euros in kickbacks to individuals in India. Borgogni told prosecutors that the slush funds had been established after a “sudden” 10 million euro per helicopter price hike in 2010.&lt;ref name=sun&gt;{{cite web| last =Jethmalani| first =Ram| title =Is UPA serious about finding the guilty? | work =Sunday Guardian| url =http://www.sunday-guardian.com/analysis/is-upa-serious-about-finding-the-guilty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''India Today'', Borgogni said that the two middlemen hired “to swing the Indian contract” were “Swiss businessmen Guido Ralph Haschke and Christian Michael,” and the Italian investigation focused on recordings of conversations between Haschke and Michael and their contacts. It was alleged that the 51 million euros “were paid to, among others, Haschke, Carlo Gerosa (Haschke's partner), Giuseppe Orsi (Finmeccanica head), Bruno Spagnolini (AgustaWestland CEO) and several unnamed Indians.”&lt;ref name=indto&gt;{{cite web| title =In a throwback to Bofors, dirty chopper deal lands UPA in another scam.

Indian politician [[Ram Jethmalani]] wrote in 2012 that the Italian investigation had apparently been “triggered by in-house Finmeccanica rivalries,” namely between Guarguaglini and Orsi. Jethmalani tied Borgogni's decision to “spill the beans” to the ouster of [[Silvio Berlusconi]] in November 2011, and to Borgogni's falling-out with Orsi, to whom he had close before Orsi apparently ordered him to resign.&lt;ref name=sun/&gt; Fittipaldi described Borgogni as a “pentito” – “someone who repents and cooperates with the investigation in order to get a lesser sentence.”&lt;ref name=hindu/&gt; According to Borgogni's charges, at least 10 million of the 51 million euros in kickbacks had been “funnelled back to Italy and paid to the Lega Nord party in return for its support to Orsi's bid to become president of Finmeccanica.”&lt;ref name=exp/&gt; One Indian report suggested that the charge that this sum had been paid to Lega Nord was “what is really novel about Borgogni's information.”&lt;ref name=sun/&gt; Guarguaglini denied on November 22, 2011, “that the company had set up slush funds or that he had given orders to pay off politicians.”&lt;ref name="Wikileaks"&gt;{{cite web| title =[OS] ITALY/CT - Monti Calls on Finmeccanica to Take 'Quick' Action on Probe | work =Wikileaks| url =https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/51/5135878_-os-italy-ct-monti-calls-on-finmeccanica-to-take-quick.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borgogni's disclosures led to what Outlook India described as “a full-fledged Italian investigation into alleged unethical dealings” by Finmeccanica. The focus of the probe was on Borgogni's “allegation that one of the middlemen, Guido Haschke, was hired as an 'intermediary' for a sum of 41 million euros,” a sum that was allegedly “hiked at the last minute by 10 million euros,” an increase that Italian investigators “zeroed in on” as evidence that company officials had used these fund to bribe Italian political parties “for plum postings.”&lt;ref name="Deshpande"&gt;{{cite web| last =Deshpande| first =Toral Varia| title =The Blade Runners| work =Outlook India| url =http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?283932}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Financial Times'' stated on April 25, 2012, that the probe, by Naples prosecutors, was focusing on Orsi and was a “formality.” Finmeccanica dismissed Borgogni’s charges as part of a personal vendetta against Orsi for having compelled his resignation.

Finmeccanica said Borgogni had admitted receiving millions of euros in “consultancy” fees from suppliers in a “clear breach of Finmeccanica’s code of ethics” and that it was considering taking legal action against him. Borgogni denied acting illegally, and confirmed that he had given the Naples prosecutors information and documents relating to Haschke and another unnamed “intermediary.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Dinmore| first =Guy| title =Finmeccanica chief in bribery probe| work =Financial Times| url =http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b3598ce4-8edd-11e1-ac13-00144feab49a.html#axzz3I7bVbfGW}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another April 25, 2012, report stated that Naples prosecutors following up Borgogni's accusations were gathering evidence in Switzerland about Finmeccanina's alleged Swiss bank accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Finmeccanica probe trail reaches Switzerland| work =Defence Web| date =Apr 25, 2012| url =http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=25196:finmeccanica-probe-trail-reaches-switzerland&amp;catid=7:Industry&amp;Itemid=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borgogni said in testimony in a Naples court on November 15, 2012, that there were “agreements” between certain officials at AgustaWestland and Guido Haschke and Michel Christian, purportedly providing for the payment of 41 million euros in bribes to these two individuals, a sum that was later allegedly raised to 51 million euros. During cross-examination, he acknowledged that his testimony about bribery was based on “rumours” he had heard at Finmeccanica and that he was not sure of the amounts of the bribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Helicopter bribe issue to rock House during Budget session| work =Business Standard| date =Feb 14, 2013| url =http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/helicopter-bribe-issue-to-rock-house-during-budget-session-113021400015_1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Indian newspaper stated on February 13, 2013, that Italian prosecutors had been “on the corruption trail for the last two years after former head of Finmeccanica's external relations wing Lorenzo Borgogni made disclosures about the payment of 51million Euros.”&lt;ref name=indto/&gt; As a result of their investigation of Borgogni's charges, Italian police in April 2013 arrested several individuals on suspicion of such crimes as criminal association, false invoicing, and corruption. At the time of the arrests, sources said that the false invoicing amounted to €40m.&lt;ref name=ibt/&gt; In January 2014, the Indian government canceled the helicopter deal with AgustaWestland.&lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{cite web| title =India in Italy court battle over helicopter deal| work =The Local| date =Mar 18, 2014| url =http://www.thelocal.it/20140318/india-faces-italy-court-battle-over-helicopter-deal}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 17, 2014, a Milan court ruled in favor of AgustaWestland in a case in which the Indian Ministry of Defense sought to recover some €278 million in bank guarantees over the scrapped helicopter deal. The next day, Indian authorities said they would appeal the verdict.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

On September 30, 2014, in his final summation in the trial of Orsi on the charges stemming from Borgogni's accusations, Orsi's defense lawyer Ennio Amodio said that Orsi was innocent of all charges. Amodio said, “Orsi believed his role was to clean up old corruption and to do this he got rid of 40 people,” including Borgogni, and insisted that Borgogni had only leveled accusations against Orsi “because he had been ousted by Orsi.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Defense Claims Corporate Clash Fueled Orsi Bribery Allegations| work =C4ISR&amp;Networks| url =http://www.c4isrnet.com/article/M5/20141005/DEFREG01/310050010/Defense-Claims-Corporate-Clash-Fueled-Orsi-Bribery-Allegations}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 9, 2014, Orsi and his co-defendant, former AgustaWestland executive Bruno Spagnolini, were both sentenced to two years in prison for false bookkeeping and acquitted of international corruption in the helicopter case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Cassin| first =Richard| title =Ex Finmeccanica boss Orsi cleared of India bribery| work =FCPA Blog| date =Oct 14, 2014| url =http://www.fcpablog.com/blog/2014/10/14/ex-finmeccanica-boss-orsi-cleared-of-india-bribery.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
On March 24, 2014, Italian police arrested Borgogni and Stefano Carlini, a former director of Finmeccanica's electronics unit, Selex Service Management, on charges of criminal association and corruption&lt;ref name=ibt/&gt; in relation to the development of the Sistri system.&lt;ref name=defn/&gt; Both men were accused of “paying bribes and siphoning money off to foreign bank accounts.”&lt;ref name=loc/&gt; The arrest had nothing to do with the helicopter scandal. Two entrepreneurs were also arrested at the same time in connection with the probe.&lt;ref name=defn/&gt; Borgogni was placed under house arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Mastrantonio| first =Silvia| title =Tangenti e fondi neri in Finmeccanica, arrestato l'ex manager Lorenzo Borgoni| work =La Nazione| url =http://www.lanazione.it/siena/cronaca/2014/03/25/1043842-tangenti-finmeccanica.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rome businessmen Vincenzo Angeloni and Luigi Malavisi had already been arrested for playing a part in the bribery, while Guarguaglini remained under investigation. According to The Local, “Borgogni and the others were believed to have created a system of false invoicing between Selex and other companies, and in order to cover this up they had created false businesses in Delaware and deposited money in Switzerland.” In addition to arresting Borgogni and his alleged accomplices, police “seized 28 bank accounts and two safe-deposit boxes.”&lt;ref name=loc/&gt; According to Defense News, Italian magistrates suspected that money in large slush funds related to the Sistri matter had ended up “in the coffers of Italian political parties.”&lt;ref name=defn/&gt;

Finmeccanica said it had sued “certain suppliers” for damages in relation to the Sistri case.&lt;ref name=defn/&gt; It was reported in late March 2014 that Borgogni was “due to be questioned by investigators on April 1.”&lt;ref name=defn/&gt;

==Other controversies==
As of November 2011, Borgogni was “under investigation over possible illicit payments as part of a criminal inquiry in Rome into contracts for Enav SpA, Italy's air-traffic control agency.” Borgogni said in a statement about the investigation that he had “always acted with respect for the law and in the best interest” of Finmeccanica.&lt;ref name="Wikileaks"/&gt; In the Enav case, a prosecutor asked for Borgogni's imprisonment in connection with charges of illegal payments to political parties, but a juge decided that such a measure was not yet necessary.  head of external relations of Finmeccanica are mentioned as suspects for illegal financing of political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Italian Parliamentary question on removal of Marina Grossi from Selex Sistemi Integrati (Finmeccanica)| work =Avio News| url =http://www.avionews.com/index.php?corpo=see_news_home.php&amp;news_id=1136065&amp;pagina_chiamante=index.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borgogni's Accademia dei Risorti and a firm called Poyel Produzioni produced a 2013 film called “Giallo Toscano” (Yellow Tuscan”) with the collaboration of the municipality of Milan and the Milanese company On Air, and with the support of the region of Tuscany and of the Tuscan Film Commission. An Italian film periodical described the movie as Borgogni's attempt to lend a helping hand to his native region in a time of crisis.&lt;ref name=mov/&gt; A minor controversy developed in January 2014, however, over the fact that the Tuscan government and film commission had given tens of thousands of euros to support Borgogni's production despite the fact that he was under investigation for criminal activities.&lt;ref name="Libero"/&gt; Also a source of controversy was the fact that a partner of Borgogni in the production of the film was Paolo Oliverio, who had been arrested in November 2013 on charges of kidnapping.&lt;ref name=ilsz/&gt;

The '''Media-Analyse (ma)''' (''English'': '''Media Analysis (MA)''') by [[Media-Analyse AG]] (AGMA) is the largest annually conducted media analysis in [[Germany]] and the largest survey of media [[consumer behavior]] in Germany overall.  It examines the total population as well as its subgroups.  The survey occurs telephonically or with questionnaires given to a representative cross-section of the total population sample.

The yearly use of media is queried using dated surveys and daily routine studies.  Initially, only the [[German language|German-speaking]] population of Germany was questioned, limited to those living in private households which was the main place of residence, and limited to those at least 14 years old.  In 2008, the age limit was reduced to ten years old and [[European Union]] foreigners were incorporated. From 2010, “other foreigners” are also now questioned.  This includes approximately 50,000 young people and adults who are chosen by random selection according to the ADM sampling system.  They are subsequently questioned, some in person and some telephonically ([[Computer-assisted telephone interviewing|CATI]]).  In the process, the subgroups are described based on their demographic features such as age, sex, occupation, income, religion, and community size.

The results of the media analysis are issued on behalf of AGMA by its subsidiary Media Micro Census.  They have large practical relevance because they largely determine the booking behavior of the advertising industry.  The MA thus indirectly determines the price a media provider can charge for advertising.  It is hence regularly observed that some radio stations use a large part of their annual advertising budget during the survey period of the MA.

== MA Pressemedien ==
In ''MA Pressemedien'' (''English'': ''MA Press Media''), data is obtained on magazines, daily newspapers, supplements, city magazines, KONPRESS (denominational press; church newspapers), reading circles, and cinema.  ''MA 2006 Pressemedien II'', published on July 26, 2006, noted 170 magazines.  For this study, around 39,000 interviews were collectively carried out in two waves during a year (February 27, 2005 – February 4, 2006).  The MA 2007 Pressemedien I appeared in January 2007.

From the Second Wave MA 2004 (September 2003 – February 2004) on, some changes in the survey method were carried out, one of which was the launch of the Title Split Method (division of the approximately 180 titles submitted into three otherwise identical questionnaire versions) as well as (first only in approximately 10% of the interviews) the [[Computer-assisted self interviewing|CASI]] method.

Through the introduction of the title split models, the reach of the magazines increases over the two waves by an average of 7% - though with clear deviations for individual titles up or down.  A direct comparison of historical data is hence no longer justifiable because of methodological reasons.

As so-called “media currency”, the ''readers per issue (LpA)'' was established in the MA Pressemedien.  It shows how many readers an issue of a certain magazine or newspaper has.

== MA Radio ==
In ''MA Radio'', the radio consumption for individual stations is queried.  The MA Radio is conducted telephonically (the so-called CATI survey model), for which 58,011 people were questioned and appeared as ''MA 2006 Radio I'' on March 8, 2006.

As media currency, the so-called ''listeners per hour'' (for pre-determined hours) is reported as well as the ''average listeners per hour'' and the ''listeners per day''.

== MA Plakat ==
The first ''MA Plakat'' (''English'': ''MA Placard'') under the AGMA roof appeared on September 22, 2004.

On December 19, 2007 the MA 2007 Plakat was published.  The coverage method of the MA Plakat was completely revised in 2007.  The data is now based on a combined survey model, consisting of a CATI survey and a measurement method with a GPS receiver.

== Online Forschung AG (AGOF) ==
Since 2009, the collected ''Internet Facts'' of the ''Online Forschung AG (AGOF)'' (''English'': ''Online Research AG'') also fall under the methodological responsibility of the ''MA''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agma-mmc.de/files/PMma09Online_I.pdf Pressemitteilung der AG-MA (pdf)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223164524/http://www.agma-mmc.de/files/PMma09Online_I.pdf |date=2010-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AGOF records internet usage behavior with the Three Pillar Model:
*First Pillar: Technical measurement (computer-level, units are individual visits and page views, obtained by [[IP Address]])
*Second Pillar: On-site surveys (Population is all internet users over 14 years old, reference to users in front of the computer, online questionnaires by pop-up window, query to place of use, time of use, sociodemographic data)
*Third Pillar: Phone surveys (CATI, population-level)

== MA Intermedia ==
In the fall of each year, ''MA Intermedia'' also appears, in which information for magazines, newspapers, TV, and radio is summarized.

== General queries ==
In addition to media use, sociodemographic characteristics, leisure time behavior, and shopping behavior are collected.  The questionnaire is largely identical to all MA studies (Press Media, Radio, Daily Newspaper).

== Licenses ==
The current data is only at the disposal of members of the ''Media-Analyse AG eV'' (publishing houses, radio stations, advertising agencies, advertisers, etc.).  However, one can create a free individual query, e.g. about advertising departments of the publishing houses.

== Publication ==
The Media-Analyse appears twice per year for Pressemedien and Radio, and once per year for Tageszeitungen (''English'': Daily Newspapers) and Plakat.  In [[Nordrhein-Westfalen]], the MA Radio is expanded for local radio stations through the E.M.A. NRW, while in [[Bavaria]], it is expanded through the Radio Analysis.

The first ''Leser-Analyse'' (''English'': ''Reader Analysis'') appeared in 1954, and thus AGMA celebrated its 50-year anniversary in 2004.

== Further analysis files ==
A whole series of further market and media studies of different providers are based on the MA-determined reach results, among them the TdW (Typologie der Wünsche (''English'': Typology of Desires) by Hubert Burda Media), VA (Verbraucher-Analyse (''English'': Consumer Analysis) by Axel Springer Publishers and Bauer Publishers), Communication Networks (Focus Magazine Publishers), MarkenProfile (''English'': BrandsProfile), VuMA, etc.

'''Peter David Aitchison''' is a former New Zealand [[Rowing (sport)|rower]] and manufacturer of farming equipment.

A member of the Union Boat Club in [[Whanganui]], Aitchison was a member of the victorious Union crew—along with [[Donald Gemmell]], [[Frank Crotty]], [[Graeme Moran]] and [[Richard Tuffin]] ([[Coxswain (rowing)|coxswain]])—that won the coxed fours title at the New Zealand national rowing championships in 1958. The same crew went on to represent New Zealand at the [[New Zealand at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]] in Cardiff, finishing fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://unionboatclub.co.nz/2017/01/08/passing-of-frank-crotty/ | title=Passing of Frank Crotty | date=8 January 2017 | publisher=Union Boat Club Whanganui | accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.taradalerotary.co.nz/paul_harris_rotary_awards.htm | title=Paul Harris Fellows | publisher=Rotary Club of Taradale | accessdate=14 January 2017 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406061006/http://taradalerotary.co.nz/paul_harris_rotary_awards.htm | archivedate=6 April 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org.nz/athletes/peter-aitchison/ |title=Peter Aitchison |year=2016 |website= |publisher=New Zealand Olympic Committee |accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aitchison went on to have a successful career as a manufacturer, importer and exporter of farming equipment, founding Aitchison Industries based in Whanganui. The company produces and exports [[seed drill]]s, [[cultivator]]s, fertiliser spreaders and other farming equipment around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=River City flush with business prosperity | date=19 November 1996 | work=The Dominion | page=9 | first=Jon |last=Morgan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reesegroup.co.nz/Aitchison/about.html |title=About Aitchison |year=2009 |website= |publisher=Reese Group |accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Soil conservation equipment ready | date=March 1998 | work=Southerner | page=9 | first=Lyn | last=McKinnon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Drill 'marriage' opens up new seed methods | date=12 October 1994 | work=New Zealand Farmer | page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Aitchison and his wife, Sylvia, retired to the [[Wellington]] suburb of [[Roseneath, Wellington|Roseneath]]. In 2015, the couple made national headlines after their neighbour built a four-metre high fence blocking their view of Wellington harbour.

{{Refimprove|date=June 2011}}
'''Predictive analytics''' encompasses a variety of statistical techniques from [[data mining]], [[Predictive modelling|predictive modelling]], and [[machine learning]], that analyze current and historical facts to make predictions about future or otherwise unknown events.&lt;ref name="Nyce"&gt;{{citation|last=Nyce|first=Charles|title=Predictive Analytics White Paper|url=https://www.the-digital-insurer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/78-Predictive-Modeling-White-Paper.pdf|publisher=American Institute for Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters/Insurance Institute of America|year=2007|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerson"&gt;{{citation|last=Eckerson|first=Wayne|title=Extending the Value of Your Data Warehousing Investment|url=http://tdwi.org/articles/2007/05/10/predictive-analytics.aspx?sc_lang=en|publisher=The Data Warehouse Institute|date=May 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In business, predictive models exploit [[pattern detection|patterns]] found in historical and transactional data to identify risks and opportunities. Models capture relationships among many factors to allow assessment of risk or potential associated with a particular set of conditions, guiding [[decision making]] for candidate transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coker|first1=Frank|title=Pulse: Understanding the Vital Signs of Your Business |date=2014|publisher=Ambient Light Publishing|location=Bellevue, WA|isbn=978-0-9893086-0-1|pages=30, 39, 42, more |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defining functional effect of these technical approaches is that predictive analytics provides a predictive score (probability) for each individual (customer, employee, healthcare patient, product SKU, vehicle, component, machine, or other organizational unit) in order to determine, inform, or influence organizational processes that pertain across large numbers of individuals, such as in marketing, credit risk assessment, fraud detection, manufacturing, healthcare, and government operations including law enforcement.

One of the best-known applications is [[credit scoring]],&lt;ref name="Nyce" /&gt; which is used throughout [[financial services]]. Scoring models process a customer's [[credit history]], [[loan application]], customer data, etc., in order to rank-order individuals by their likelihood of making future credit payments on time.

==Definition==
Predictive analytics is an area of statistics that deals with [[information extraction|extracting information]] from data and using it to predict [[trend analysis|trend]]s and behavior patterns.  The enhancement of predictive web analytics calculates statistical probabilities of future events online. Predictive analytics statistical techniques include data modeling, machine learning, AI, deep learning algorithms and data mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.personali.com/answers/predictive-analytics/|title=UX Optimization Glossary &gt; Data Science &gt; Web Analytics &gt; Predictive Analytics|last=Personali|first=|date=|website=www.personali.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the unknown event of interest is in the future, but predictive analytics can be applied to any type of unknown whether it be in the past, present or future. For example, identifying suspects after a crime has been committed, or credit card fraud as it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finlay|first1=Steven|title=Predictive Analytics, Data Mining and Big Data. Myths, Misconceptions and Methods|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=1137379278|pages=237|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core of predictive analytics relies on capturing relationships between [[explanatory variable]]s and the predicted variables from past occurrences, and exploiting them to predict the unknown outcome. It is important to note, however, that the accuracy and usability of results will depend greatly on the level of data analysis and the quality of assumptions.

Predictive analytics is often defined as predicting at a more detailed level of granularity, i.e., generating predictive scores (probabilities) for each individual organizational element. This distinguishes it from forecasting. For example, "Predictive analytics—Technology that learns from experience (data) to predict the future behavior of individuals in order to drive better decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siegel|first1=Eric|title=Predictive Analytics: The Power to Predict Who Will Click, Buy, Lie, or Die|date=2013|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-1183-5685-2|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; In future industrial systems, the value of predictive analytics will be to predict and prevent potential issues to achieve near-zero break-down and further be integrated into [[prescriptive analytics]] for decision optimization.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Furthermore, the converted data can be used for closed-loop product life cycle improvement&lt;ref name="WatchdogPaper"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Djurdjanovic|first1=Dragan|last2=Lee|first2=Jay|last3=Ni|first3=Jun|title=Watchdog Agent—an infotronics-based prognostics approach for product performance degradation assessment and prediction|journal=Advanced Engineering Informatics|date=July 2003|volume=17|issue=3–4|pages=109–125|doi=10.1016/j.aei.2004.07.005|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474034604000102}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the vision of the [[Industrial Internet Consortium]].

==Types==
Generally, the term predictive analytics is used to mean [[predictive modeling]], "scoring" data with predictive models, and [[forecasting]]. However, people are increasingly using the term to refer to related analytical disciplines, such as descriptive modeling and decision modeling or optimization. These disciplines also involve rigorous data analysis, and are widely used in business for segmentation and decision making, but have different purposes and the statistical techniques underlying them vary.

===Predictive models===
[[Predictive modeling|Predictive models]] are models of the relation between the specific performance of a unit in a sample and one or more known attributes or features of the unit. The objective of the model is to assess the likelihood that a similar unit in a different sample will exhibit the specific performance. This category encompasses models in many areas, such as marketing, where they seek out subtle data patterns to answer questions about customer performance, or fraud detection models. Predictive models often perform calculations during live transactions, for example, to evaluate the risk or opportunity of a given customer or transaction, in order to guide a decision. With advancements in computing speed, individual agent modeling systems have become capable of simulating human behaviour or reactions to given stimuli or scenarios.

The available sample units with known attributes and known performances is referred to as the "training sample". The units in other samples, with known attributes but unknown performances, are referred to as "out of [training] sample" units. The out of sample units do not necessarily bear a chronological relation to the training sample units. For example, the training sample may consist of literary attributes of writings by Victorian authors, with known attribution, and the out-of sample unit may be newly found writing with unknown authorship; a predictive model may aid in attributing a work to a known author. Another example is given by analysis of blood splatter in simulated crime scenes in which the out of sample unit is the actual blood splatter pattern from a crime scene. The out of sample unit may be from the same time as the training units, from a previous time, or from a future time.

===Descriptive models===
Descriptive models quantify relationships in data in a way that is often used to classify customers or prospects into groups. Unlike predictive models that focus on predicting a single customer behavior (such as credit risk), descriptive models identify many different relationships between customers or products. Descriptive models do not rank-order customers by their likelihood of taking a particular action the way predictive models do. Instead, descriptive models can be used, for example, to categorize customers by their product preferences and life stage. Descriptive modeling tools can be utilized to develop further models that can simulate large number of individualized agents and make predictions.

===Decision models===
{{Main article|Decision model}}
[[Decision model]]s describe the relationship between all the elements of a decision—the known data (including results of predictive models), the decision, and the forecast results of the decision—in order to predict the results of decisions involving many variables. These models can be used in optimization, maximizing certain outcomes while minimizing others. Decision models are generally used to develop decision logic or a set of business rules that will produce the desired action for every customer or circumstance.

==Applications==
Although predictive analytics can be put to use in many applications, we outline a few examples where predictive analytics has shown positive impact in recent years.

===Analytical customer relationship management (CRM)===
Analytical [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) is a frequent commercial application of predictive analysis. Methods of predictive analysis are applied to customer data to pursue CRM objectives, which involve constructing a holistic view of the customer no matter where their information resides in the company or the department involved. CRM uses predictive analysis in applications for marketing campaigns, sales, and customer services to name a few. These tools are required in order for a company to posture and focus their efforts effectively across the breadth of their customer base.  They must analyze and understand the products in demand or have the potential for high demand, predict customers' buying habits in order to promote relevant products at multiple [[touch point]]s, and proactively identify and mitigate issues that have the potential to lose customers or reduce their ability to gain new ones. Analytical customer relationship management can be applied throughout the [[Customer lifecycle management|customers' lifecycle]] ([[Customer acquisition management|acquisition]], [[Cross-selling|relationship growth]], [[Customer retention|retention]], and win-back). Several of the application areas described below (direct marketing, cross-sell, customer retention) are part of customer relationship management.

===Child protection===
Over the last 5 years, some child welfare agencies have started using predictive analytics to flag high risk cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chronicleofsocialchange.org/blogger-co-op/new-strategies-long-overdue-measuring-child-welfare-risk/15442|title=New Strategies Long Overdue on Measuring Child Welfare Risk - The Chronicle of Social Change|website=The Chronicle of Social Change|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach has been called "innovative" by the Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities (CECANF),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eckerd.org/2016/03/23/eckerd-rapid-safety-feedback-highlighted-national-report-commission-eliminate-child-abuse-neglect-fatalities/|title=Eckerd Rapid Safety Feedback® Highlighted in National Report of Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities|website=Eckerd Kids|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Hillsborough County, Florida]], where the lead child welfare agency uses a predictive modeling tool, there have been no abuse-related child deaths in the target population as of this writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/cecanf_final_report.pdf|title=A National Strategy to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities|date=|website=|publisher=Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities. (2016)|access-date=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical decision support systems===
Experts use predictive analysis in health care primarily to determine which patients are at risk of developing certain conditions, like diabetes, asthma, heart disease, and other lifetime illnesses. Additionally, sophisticated [[clinical decision support system]]s incorporate predictive analytics to support medical decision making at the point of care. A working definition has been proposed by Jerome A. Osheroff and colleagues:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jamia.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/2/141.short|title=A Roadmap for National Action on Clinical Decision Support|website=JAMIA|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Clinical decision support ('''CDS''') provides clinicians, staff, patients, or other individuals with knowledge and person-specific information, intelligently filtered or presented at appropriate times, to enhance health and health care. It encompasses a variety of tools and interventions such as computerized alerts and reminders, clinical guidelines, order sets, patient data reports and dashboards, documentation templates, diagnostic support, and clinical workflow tools''.

A 2016 study of [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative disorders]] provides a powerful example of a CDS platform to diagnose, track, predict and monitor the progression of [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Predictive Big Data Analytics: A Study of Parkinson's Disease using Large, Complex, Heterogeneous, Incongruent, Multi-source and Incomplete Observations|website=PLoS ONE|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0157077 | volume=11|page=e0157077|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1157077D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using large and multi-source imaging, genetics, clinical and demographic data, these investigators developed a decision support system that can predict the state of the disease with high accuracy, consistency and precision. They employed classical model-based and machine learning model-free methods to discriminate between different patient and control groups. Similar approaches may be used for predictive diagnosis and disease progression forecasting in many neurodegenerative disorders like [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]], [[Huntington's disease|Huntington’s]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], and for other clinical and biomedical applications where Big Data is available.

===Collection analytics===
Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do not make their payments on time. The financial institution has to undertake collection activities on these customers to recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to recover. Predictive analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs.

===Cross-sell===
Often corporate organizations collect and maintain abundant data (e.g. customer [[Business record|record]]s, sale transactions) as exploiting hidden relationships in the data can provide a competitive advantage. For an organization that offers multiple products, predictive analytics can help analyze customers' spending, usage and other behavior, leading to efficient [[cross-selling|cross sales]], or selling additional products to current customers.&lt;ref name="Eckerson" /&gt; This directly leads to higher profitability per customer and stronger customer relationships.

===Customer retention===
With the number of competing services available, businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous [[customer satisfaction]], rewarding consumer loyalty and minimizing [[customer attrition]]. In addition, small increases in customer retention have been shown to increase profits disproportionately. One study concluded that a 5% increase in customer retention rates will increase profits by 25% to 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reichheld|first1=Frederick|last2=Schefter|first2=Phil|title=The Economics of E-Loyalty |url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/1590.html|work=Havard Business School Working Knowledge|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a reactive basis, acting only after the customer has initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, the chance of changing the customer's decision is almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a frequent examination of a customer's past service usage, service performance, spending and other behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime soon.&lt;ref  name="Barkin" /&gt; An intervention with lucrative offers can increase the chance of retaining the customer. Silent attrition, the behavior of a customer to slowly but steadily reduce usage, is another problem that many companies face. Predictive analytics can also predict this behavior, so that the company can take proper actions to increase customer activity.

===Direct marketing===
When [[marketing]] consumer products and services, there is the challenge of keeping up with competing products and consumer behavior. Apart from identifying prospects, predictive analytics can also help to identify the most effective combination of product versions, marketing material, communication channels and timing that should be used to target a given consumer. The goal of predictive analytics is typically to lower the [[cost per order]] or [[cost per action]].

===Fraud detection===
[[Fraud]] is a big problem for many businesses and can be of various types: inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent [[financial transaction|transactions]] (both offline and online), [[identity theft]]s and false [[insurance claim]]s. Some examples of likely victims are [[Credit card fraud|credit card issuers]], insurance companies,&lt;ref name = "Schiff"&gt;{{citation|last=Schiff|first=Mike|title=BI Experts: Why Predictive Analytics Will Continue to Grow|url=http://tdwi.org/Articles/2012/03/06/Predictive-Analytics-Growth.aspx?Page=1|publisher=The Data Warehouse Institute|date=March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; retail merchants, manufacturers, business-to-business suppliers and even services providers. A predictive model can help weed out the "bads" and reduce a business's exposure to fraud.

Predictive modeling can also be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates in business or the public sector. [[Mark Nigrini]] developed a risk-scoring method to identify audit targets. He describes the use of this approach to detect fraud in the franchisee sales reports of an international fast-food chain. Each location is scored using 10 predictors. The 10 scores are then weighted to give one final overall risk score for each location. The same scoring approach was also used to identify high-risk check kiting accounts, potentially fraudulent travel agents, and questionable vendors. A reasonably complex model was used to identify fraudulent monthly reports submitted by divisional controllers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) of the United States also uses predictive analytics to mine tax returns and identify [[tax fraud]].&lt;ref name="Schiff" /&gt;

Recent{{When|date=October 2011}} advancements in technology have also introduced predictive behavior analysis for web fraud detection. This type of solution utilizes [[heuristics]] in order to study normal web user behavior and detect anomalies indicating fraud attempts.

===Portfolio, product or economy-level prediction===
Often the focus of analysis is not the consumer but the product, portfolio, firm, industry or even the economy. For example, a retailer might be interested in predicting store-level demand for inventory management purposes. Or the Federal Reserve Board might be interested in predicting the unemployment rate for the next year. These types of problems can be addressed by predictive analytics using time series techniques (see below). They can also be addressed via machine learning approaches which transform the original time series into a feature vector space, where the learning algorithm finds patterns that have predictive power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dhar |first=Vasant |title=Prediction in Financial Markets: The Case for Small Disjuncts |journal=ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology|date=April 2011|volume=2|issue=3|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1961191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dhar|first=Vasant |author2=Chou, Dashin |author3=Provost Foster|title=Discovering Interesting Patterns in Investment Decision Making with GLOWER – A Genetic Learning Algorithm Overlaid With Entropy Reduction|journal=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery|date=October 2000|volume=4|issue=4|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=593502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Project risk management===
{{Main article|Project risk management}}

When employing risk management techniques, the results are always to predict and benefit from a future scenario. The [[capital asset pricing model]] (CAP-M) "predicts" the best portfolio to maximize return. [[Probabilistic risk assessment]] (PRA) when combined with mini-[[Delphi method|Delphi techniques]] and statistical approaches yields accurate forecasts. These are examples of approaches that can extend from project to market, and from near to long term. [[Underwriting]] (see below) and other business approaches identify risk management as a predictive method.

===Underwriting===

Many businesses have to account for risk exposure due to their different services and determine the cost needed to cover the risk. For example, auto insurance providers need to accurately determine the amount of premium to charge to cover each automobile and driver. A financial company needs to assess a borrower's potential and ability to pay before granting a loan. For a health insurance provider, predictive analytics can analyze a few years of past medical claims data, as well as lab, pharmacy and other records where available, to predict how expensive an enrollee is likely to be in the future. Predictive analytics can help [[underwrite]] these quantities by predicting the chances of illness, [[Default (finance)|default]], [[bankruptcy]], etc. Predictive analytics can streamline the process of customer acquisition by predicting the future risk behavior of a customer using application level data.&lt;ref name="Conz" /&gt; Predictive analytics in the form of credit scores have reduced the amount of time it takes for loan approvals, especially in the mortgage market where lending decisions are now made in a matter of hours rather than days or even weeks. Proper predictive analytics can lead to proper pricing decisions, which can help mitigate future risk of default.

==Technology and big data influences==
[[Big data]] is a collection of data sets that are so large and complex that they become awkward to work with using traditional [[database management]] tools. The volume, variety and velocity of big data have introduced challenges across the board for capture, storage, search, sharing, analysis, and visualization. Examples of big data sources include [[web log]]s, [[RFID]], [[sensor network|sensor]] data, [[social network]]s, Internet search indexing, call detail records, military surveillance, and complex data in astronomic, biogeochemical, genomics, and atmospheric sciences. Big Data is the core of most predictive analytic services offered by IT organizations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hcltech.com/sites/default/files/key_to_monetizing_big_data_via_predictive_analytics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thanks to technological advances in computer hardware—faster CPUs, cheaper memory, and [[Massive parallel processing|MPP]] architectures—and new technologies such as [[Hadoop]], [[MapReduce]], and [[In-database processing|in-database]] and [[text analytics]] for processing big data, it is now feasible to collect, analyze, and mine massive amounts of structured and [[unstructured data]] for new insights.&lt;ref name="Schiff" /&gt; It is also possible to run predictive algorithms on streaming data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~mpechen/publications/pubs/PA_EDS_HPCS15.pdf|title=Predictive Analytics on Evolving Data Streams|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, exploring big data and using predictive analytics is within reach of more organizations than ever before and new methods that are capable for handling such datasets are proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Analytical techniques==

The approaches and techniques used to conduct predictive analytics can broadly be grouped into regression techniques and machine learning techniques.

===Regression techniques===

[[Regression analysis|Regression]] models are the mainstay of predictive analytics. The focus lies on establishing a mathematical equation as a model to represent the interactions between the different variables in consideration. Depending on the situation, there are a wide variety of models that can be applied while performing predictive analytics. Some of them are briefly discussed below.

====Linear regression model====

The [[linear regression model]] analyzes the relationship between the response or dependent variable and a set of independent or predictor variables. This relationship is expressed as an equation that predicts the response variable as a linear function of the parameters. These parameters are adjusted so that a measure of fit is optimized. Much of the effort in model fitting is focused on minimizing the size of the residual, as well as ensuring that it is randomly distributed with respect to the model predictions.

The goal of regression is to select the parameters of the model so as to minimize the sum of the squared residuals.  This is referred to as [[ordinary least squares]] (OLS) estimation and results in best linear unbiased estimates (BLUE) of the parameters if and only if the [[Gauss–Markov theorem|Gauss-Markov]] assumptions are satisfied.

Once the model has been estimated we would be interested to know if the predictor variables belong in the model—i.e. is the estimate of each variable's contribution reliable? To do this we can check the statistical significance of the model's coefficients which can be measured using the t-statistic. This amounts to testing whether the coefficient is significantly different from zero. How well the model predicts the dependent variable based on the value of the independent variables can be assessed by using the R² statistic. It measures predictive power of the model i.e. the proportion of the total variation in the dependent variable that is "explained" (accounted for) by variation in the independent variables.

====Discrete choice models====

Multiple regression (above) is generally used when the response variable is continuous and has an unbounded range. Often the response variable may not be continuous but rather discrete. While mathematically it is feasible to apply multiple regression to discrete ordered dependent variables, some of the assumptions behind the theory of multiple linear regression no longer hold, and there are other techniques such as discrete choice models which are better suited for this type of analysis. If the dependent variable is discrete, some of those superior methods are [[logistic regression]], [[multinomial logit]] and [[probit]] models. Logistic regression and probit models are used when the dependent variable is [[binary numeral system|binary]].

====Logistic regression====
{{Main article|Logistic regression}}
In a classification setting, assigning outcome probabilities to observations can be achieved through the use of a logistic model, which is basically a method which transforms information about the binary dependent variable into an unbounded continuous variable and estimates a regular multivariate model (See Allison's ''Logistic Regression'' for more information on the theory of logistic regression).

The [[Wald test|Wald]] and [[likelihood-ratio test]] are used to test the statistical significance of each coefficient ''b'' in the model (analogous to the t tests used in OLS regression; see above). A test assessing the goodness-of-fit of a classification model is the "percentage correctly predicted".

====Multinomial logistic regression====

An extension of the [[binary logit model]] to cases where the dependent variable has more than 2 categories is the [[multinomial logit model]]. In such cases collapsing the data into two categories might not make good sense or may lead to loss in the richness of the data. The multinomial logit model is the appropriate technique in these cases, especially when the dependent variable categories are not ordered (for examples colors like red, blue, green). Some authors have extended multinomial regression to include feature selection/importance methods such as [[random multinomial logit]].

====Probit regression====

[[Probit model]]s offer an alternative to logistic regression for modeling categorical dependent variables. Even though the outcomes tend to be similar, the underlying distributions are different. Probit models are popular in social sciences like economics.

A good way to understand the key difference between probit and logit models is to assume that the dependent variable is driven by a latent variable z, which is a sum of a linear combination of explanatory variables and a random noise term.

We do not observe z but instead observe y which takes the value 0 (when z &lt; 0) or 1 (otherwise). In the logit model we assume that the random noise term follows a [[logistic distribution]] with mean zero. In the probit model we assume that it follows a normal distribution with mean zero. Note that in social sciences (e.g. economics), probit is often used to model situations where the observed variable y is continuous but takes values between 0 and 1.

====Logit versus probit====

The [[probit model]] has been around longer than the [[logit model]]. They behave similarly, except that the [[logistic distribution]] tends to be slightly flatter tailed. One of the reasons the logit model was formulated was that the probit model was computationally difficult due to the requirement of numerically calculating integrals. Modern computing however has made this computation fairly simple. The coefficients obtained from the logit and probit model are fairly close. However, the [[odds ratio]] is easier to interpret in the logit model.

Practical reasons for choosing the probit model over the logistic model would be:
* There is a strong belief that the underlying distribution is normal
* The actual event is not a binary outcome (''e.g.'', bankruptcy status) but a proportion (''e.g.'', proportion of population at different debt levels).

====Time series models====

[[Time series]] models are used for predicting or forecasting the future behavior of variables. These models account for the fact that data points taken over time may have an internal structure (such as autocorrelation, trend or seasonal variation) that should be accounted for. As a result, standard regression techniques cannot be applied to time series data and methodology has been developed to decompose the trend, seasonal and cyclical component of the series. Modeling the dynamic path of a variable can improve forecasts since the predictable component of the series can be projected into the future.

Time series models estimate difference equations containing stochastic components. Two commonly used forms of these models are [[autoregressive model]]s (AR) and [[Moving-average model|moving-average]] (MA) models. The [[Box–Jenkins]] methodology (1976) developed by George Box and G.M. Jenkins combines the AR and MA models to produce the [[Autoregressive moving average model|ARMA]] (autoregressive moving average) model, which is the cornerstone of stationary time series analysis. [[Autoregressive integrated moving average|ARIMA]] (autoregressive integrated moving average models), on the other hand, are used to describe non-stationary time series. Box and Jenkins suggest differencing a non-stationary time series to obtain a stationary series to which an ARMA model can be applied. Non-stationary time series have a pronounced trend and do not have a constant long-run mean or variance.

Box and Jenkins proposed a three-stage methodology involving model identification, estimation and validation. The identification stage involves identifying if the series is stationary or not and the presence of seasonality by examining plots of the series, autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions.  In the estimation stage, models are estimated using non-linear time series or maximum likelihood estimation procedures. Finally the validation stage involves diagnostic checking such as plotting the residuals to detect outliers and evidence of model fit.

In recent years time series models have become more sophisticated and attempt to model conditional heteroskedasticity with models such as ARCH ([[autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity]]) and GARCH (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) models frequently used for financial time series. In addition time series models are also used to understand inter-relationships among economic variables represented by systems of equations using VAR (vector autoregression) and structural VAR models.

====Survival or duration analysis====

[[Survival analysis]] is another name for time-to-event analysis. These techniques were primarily developed in the medical and biological sciences, but they are also widely used in the social sciences like economics, as well as in engineering (reliability and failure time analysis).

Censoring and non-normality, which are characteristic of survival data, generate difficulty when trying to analyze the data using conventional statistical models such as multiple [[linear regression]]. The [[normal distribution]], being a symmetric distribution, takes positive as well as negative values, but duration by its very nature cannot be negative and therefore normality cannot be assumed when dealing with duration/survival data. Hence the normality assumption of regression models is violated.

The assumption is that if the data were not censored it would be representative of the population of interest. In survival analysis, censored observations arise whenever the dependent variable of interest represents the time to a terminal event, and the duration of the study is limited in time.

An important concept in survival analysis is the [[hazard rate]], defined as the probability that the event will occur at time t conditional on surviving until time t. Another concept related to the hazard rate is the survival function which can be defined as the probability of surviving to time t.

Most models try to model the hazard rate by choosing the underlying distribution depending on the shape of the hazard function.  A distribution whose hazard function slopes upward is said to have positive duration dependence, a decreasing hazard shows negative duration dependence whereas constant hazard is a process with no memory usually characterized by the exponential distribution. Some of the distributional choices in survival models are: F, gamma, Weibull, log normal, inverse normal, exponential etc. All these distributions are for a non-negative random variable.

Duration models can be parametric, non-parametric or semi-parametric. Some of the models commonly used are [[Kaplan-Meier]] and Cox proportional hazard model (non parametric).

====Classification and regression trees (CART)====
{{main article|Decision tree learning}}
Globally-optimal classification tree analysis (GO-CTA) (also called hierarchical optimal discriminant analysis) is a generalization of [[optimal discriminant analysis]] that may be used to identify the statistical model that has maximum accuracy for predicting the value of a categorical dependent variable for a dataset consisting of categorical and continuous variables. The output of HODA is a non-orthogonal tree that combines categorical variables and cut points for continuous variables that yields maximum predictive accuracy, an assessment of the exact Type I error rate, and an evaluation of potential cross-generalizability of the statistical model. Hierarchical optimal discriminant analysis may be thought of as a generalization of Fisher's linear discriminant analysis. Optimal discriminant analysis is an alternative to ANOVA (analysis of variance) and regression analysis, which attempt to express one dependent variable as a linear combination of other features or measurements. However, ANOVA and regression analysis give a dependent variable that is a numerical variable, while hierarchical optimal discriminant analysis gives a dependent variable that is a class variable.

Classification and regression trees (CART) are a [[non-parametric statistics|non-parametric]] [[decision tree learning]] technique that produces either classification or regression trees, depending on whether the dependent variable is categorical or numeric, respectively.

[[Decision trees]] are formed by a collection of rules based on variables in the modeling data set:
* Rules based on variables' values are selected to get the best split to differentiate observations based on the dependent variable
* Once a rule is selected and splits a node into two, the same process is applied to each "child" node (i.e. it is a recursive procedure)
* Splitting stops when CART detects no further gain can be made, or some pre-set stopping rules are met. (Alternatively, the data are split as much as possible and then the tree is later [[Pruning (decision trees)|pruned]].)

Each branch of the tree ends in a terminal node. Each observation falls into one and exactly one terminal node, and each terminal node is uniquely defined by a set of rules.

A very popular method for predictive analytics is Leo Breiman's [[random forests]].

====Multivariate adaptive regression splines====

[[Multivariate adaptive regression splines]] (MARS) is a [[Non-parametric statistics|non-parametric]] technique that builds flexible models by fitting [[piecewise]] [[linear regression]]s.

An important concept associated with [[regression spline]]s is that of a knot.  Knot is where one local regression model gives way to another and thus is the point of intersection between two splines.

In multivariate and adaptive regression splines, [[basis function]]s are the tool used for generalizing the search for knots. Basis functions are a set of functions used to represent the information contained in one or more variables.
Multivariate and Adaptive Regression Splines model almost always creates the basis functions in pairs.

Multivariate and adaptive regression spline approach deliberately [[overfit]]s the model and then prunes to get to the optimal model. The algorithm is computationally very intensive and in practice we are required to specify an upper limit on the number of basis functions.

===Machine learning techniques===

[[Machine learning]], a branch of artificial intelligence, was originally employed to develop techniques to enable computers to learn. Today, since it includes a number of advanced statistical methods for regression and classification, it finds application in a wide variety of fields including [[medical diagnostics]], [[credit card fraud]] detection, [[Face recognition|face]] and [[speech recognition]] and analysis of the [[stock market]].  In certain applications it is sufficient to directly predict the dependent variable without focusing on the underlying relationships between variables. In other cases, the underlying relationships can be very complex and the mathematical form of the dependencies unknown. For such cases, machine learning techniques emulate human [[cognition]] and learn from training examples to predict future events.

A brief discussion of some of these methods used commonly for predictive analytics is provided below. A detailed study of machine learning can be found in Mitchell (1997).

====Neural networks====

[[Neural networks]] are [[Nonlinearity|nonlinear]] sophisticated modeling techniques that are able to [[Model (abstract)|model]] complex functions. They can be applied to problems of [[Time series|prediction]], [[Statistical classification|classification]] or [[Control theory|control]] in a wide spectrum of fields such as [[finance]], [[cognitive psychology]]/[[cognitive neuroscience|neuroscience]], [[medicine]], [[engineering]], and [[physics]].

Neural networks are used when the exact nature of the relationship between inputs and output is not known. A key feature of neural networks is that they learn the relationship between inputs and output through training. There are three types of training used by different neural networks: [[Supervised learning|supervised]] and [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] training and reinforcement learning, with supervised being the most common one.

Some examples of neural network training techniques are [[backpropagation]], quick propagation, [[Conjugate gradient method|conjugate gradient descent]], [[Radial basis function|projection operator]], Delta-Bar-Delta etc. Some unsupervised network architectures are multilayer [[perceptron]]s, [[Self-organizing map|Kohonen network]]s, [[Hopfield network]]s, etc.

====Multilayer perceptron (MLP)====
The [[multilayer perceptron]] (MLP) consists of an input and an output layer with one or more hidden layers of nonlinearly-activating nodes or sigmoid nodes. This is determined by the weight vector and it is necessary to adjust the weights of the network. The backpropagation employs gradient fall to minimize the squared error between the network output values and desired values for those outputs. The weights adjusted by an iterative process of repetitive present of attributes. Small changes in the weight to get the desired values are done by the process called training the net and is done by the training set (learning rule).

====Radial basis functions====
A [[radial basis function]] (RBF) is a function which has built into it a distance criterion with respect to a center. Such functions can be used very efficiently for interpolation and for smoothing of data. Radial basis functions have been applied in the area of [[neural network]]s where they are used as a replacement for the [[Sigmoid function|sigmoidal]] transfer function. Such networks have 3 layers, the input layer, the hidden layer with the RBF non-linearity and a linear output layer. The most popular choice for the non-linearity is the Gaussian. RBF networks have the advantage of not being locked into local minima as do the [[Feed forward (control)|feed-forward]] networks such as the multilayer [[perceptron]].

====Support vector machines====

[[Support vector machine]]s (SVM) are used to detect and exploit complex patterns in data by clustering, classifying and ranking the data. They are learning machines that are used to perform binary classifications and regression estimations.  They commonly use kernel based methods to apply linear classification techniques to non-linear classification problems. There are a number of types of SVM such as linear, polynomial, sigmoid etc.

====Naïve Bayes====

[[Naive Bayes classifier|Naïve Bayes]] based on Bayes conditional probability rule is used for performing classification tasks. Naïve Bayes assumes the predictors are statistically independent which makes it an effective classification tool that is easy to interpret. It is best employed when faced with the "[[curse of dimensionality]]" problem, i.e. when the number of predictors is very high.

====''k''-nearest neighbours====

The [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|nearest neighbour algorithm]] (KNN) belongs to the class of pattern recognition statistical methods. The method does not impose a priori any assumptions about the distribution from which the modeling sample is drawn. It involves a training set with both positive and negative values.  A new sample is classified by calculating the distance to the nearest neighbouring training case. The sign of that point will determine the classification of the sample. In the k-nearest neighbour classifier, the k nearest points are considered and the sign of the majority is used to classify the sample. The performance of the kNN algorithm is influenced by three main factors: (1) the distance measure used to locate the nearest neighbours, (2) the decision rule used to derive a classification from the k-nearest neighbours, and (3) the number of neighbours used to classify the new sample. It can be proved that, unlike other methods, this method is universally asymptotically convergent, i.e. as the size of the training set increases, if the observations are [[iid|independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)]], regardless of the distribution from which the sample is drawn, the predicted class will converge to the class assignment that minimizes misclassification error. See Devroy et al.

====Geospatial predictive modeling====

Conceptually, [[geospatial predictive modeling]] is rooted in the principle that the occurrences of events being modeled are limited in distribution. Occurrences of events are neither uniform nor random in distribution—there are spatial environment factors (infrastructure, sociocultural, topographic, etc.) that constrain and influence where the locations of events occur. Geospatial predictive modeling attempts to describe those constraints and influences by spatially correlating occurrences of historical geospatial locations with environmental factors that represent those constraints and influences. Geospatial predictive modeling is a process for analyzing events through a geographic filter in order to make statements of likelihood for event occurrence or emergence.

==Tools==
Historically, using predictive analytics tools—as well as understanding the results they delivered—required advanced skills. However, modern predictive analytics tools are no longer restricted to IT specialists.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} As more organizations adopt predictive analytics into decision-making processes and integrate it into their operations, they are creating a shift in the market toward business users as the primary consumers of the information. Business users want tools they can use on their own. Vendors are responding by creating new software that removes the mathematical complexity, provides user-friendly graphic interfaces and/or builds in short cuts that can, for example, recognize the kind of data available and suggest an appropriate predictive model.&lt;ref name="Halper"&gt;{{citation|last=Halper|first=Fern|title=The Top 5 Trends in Predictive Analytics|url=http://www.information-management.com/issues/21_6/the-top-5-trends-in-redictive-an-alytics-10021460-1.html|magazine=Information Management|date=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predictive analytics tools have become sophisticated enough to adequately present and dissect data problems,{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} so that any data-savvy information worker can utilize them to analyze data and retrieve meaningful, useful results.&lt;ref name="Eckerson" /&gt; For example, modern tools present findings using simple charts, graphs, and scores that indicate the likelihood of possible outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=MacLennan|first=Jamie|title=5 Myths about Predictive Analytics|url=http://tdwi.org/articles/2012/05/01/5-predictive-analytics-myths.aspx|publisher=The Data Warehouse Institute|date=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous tools available in the marketplace that help with the execution of predictive analytics. These range from those that need very little user sophistication to those that are designed for the expert practitioner. The difference between these tools is often in the level of customization and heavy data lifting allowed.

Beside these software packages, specific tools have also been developed for industrial applications. For example, Watchdog Agent Toolbox has been developed and optimized for predictive analysis in [[prognostics and health management]] applications and is available for [[MATLAB]] and [[LabVIEW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watchdog Agent Toolbox for Labview|url=http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/210191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watchdog Agent Toolbox|url=http://www.imscenter.net/front-page/Resources/WD.pdf|website=IMSCenter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular commercial predictive analytics software packages according to the Rexer Analytics Survey for 2013 are IBM SPSS Modeler, SAS Enterprise Miner, and Dell Statistica.

===PMML===
The [[Predictive Model Markup Language]] (PMML) was proposed for standard language for expressing predictive models. Such an XML-based language provides a way for the different tools to define predictive models and to share them. PMML 4.0 was released in June, 2009.

==Criticism==
There are plenty of skeptics when it comes to computers' and algorithms' abilities to predict the future, including [[Gary King (political scientist)|Gary King]], a professor from Harvard University and the director of the Institute for Quantitative Social Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Temple-Raston|first=Dina|title=Predicting The Future: Fantasy Or A Good Algorithm?|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/10/08/162397787/predicting-the-future-fantasy-or-a-good-algorithm|publisher=NPR|date=Oct 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; People are influenced by their environment in innumerable ways. Predicting perfectly what people will do next requires that all the influential variables be known and measured accurately. "People's environments change even more quickly than they themselves do. Everything from the weather to their relationship with their mother can change the way people think and act. All of those variables are unpredictable. How they will impact a person is even less predictable. If put in the exact same situation tomorrow, they may make a completely different decision. This means that a statistical prediction is only valid in sterile laboratory conditions, which suddenly isn't as useful as it seemed before."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Alverson|first=Cameron|title=Polling and Statistical Models Can't Predict the Future |url=http://www.cameronalverson.com/2012/09/polling-and-statistical-models-cant.html|publisher=Cameron Alverson|date=Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of 1072 papers published in Information Systems Research and MIS Quarterly between 1990 and 2006, only 52 empirical papers attempted predictive claims, of which only 7 carried out proper predictive modeling or testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shmueli|first=Galit|date=2010-08-01|title=To Explain or to Predict?|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1294167961|journal=Statistical Science|language=EN|volume=25|issue=3|pages=289–310|doi=10.1214/10-STS330|issn=0883-4237|arxiv=1101.0891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ramón Pereyra Jacinto''' (born June 3, 1945), best known by his initials '''RJ ''', is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] businessman, [[musician]] and [[radio personality]].  He is the founder and chairman of Philippines' rock-and-roll radio station [[DZRJ (disambiguation)|DZRJ]], and the [[Rajah Broadcasting Network]]. Since 1963, his network has grown to a nationwide chain of radio stations (10 stations) and a UHF TV station. He is also the Chairman of Jacinto Color Steel, Inc. and the founder of RJ Guitars.

==Education==
Jacinto attended the [[Ateneo de Manila University]] and graduated with honors in Economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mb.com.ph/duterte-appoints-rj-jacinto-five-others|title = Duterte appoints RJ Jacinto, five others |date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; To further his studies, he took up law at the [[University of Sto. Tomas]] while working for his father's steel company, Iligan Integrated Steel Mills, Inc.

==Career==
At the age of 15, became an entrepreneur founding the first multi-track recording company in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.jango.com/music/RJ+Jacinto/_full_bio|title = RJ Jacinto Full Biography |date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 17, Jacinto and his friends established his radio station in his parent's backyard. The establishment of the radio station with the call letters dzRJ, would eventually become the legendary and at the same time, influential rock and roll station in the country.

At 19, Jacinto worked at the country's largest Steel Mill (IISMI) as VP Purchasing then as SVP Operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://business.inquirer.net/196715/rj-jacinto-aims-to-strike-right-note-in-roofing-sector|title = RJ Jacinto aims to strike the right note in roofing sector |date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While manning his radio station, Jacinto was also the Senior Vice-President for Purchasing of his family's businesses, with 2,500 employees reporting to him. During the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, the Jacinto family's assets were forcibly seized and placed under military control and executives of the company were jailed with no charges filed. The sequestered assets included Jacinto's two radio stations. At that time, Jacinto was in the United States and opted to stay there in exile for 14 years to save himself from being jailed. During his exile, Jacinto recorded songs together with other Filipinos and secretly sent them to the Philippines for airplay. The songs "Muli" and "Don't Let Go" became hits but the composers and singers were not named in order to avoid military sanctions.

On March 5, 1986, [[Juan Ponce Enrile]], who was then the Defense Minister, returned the radio stations and some of their family's steel mills to the Jacintos. DZRJ was finally transferred from military administration on June 1986 and Jacinto began to make DZRJ, the leader in retro wave by playing music from the '50s, '60s and '70s.

Upon returning from exile from Martial Law, Jacinto established a string of businesses:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/267963/publicaffairs/powerhouse/pasukin-ang-tahanan-ni-mr-rock-and-roll-rj-jacinto|title = Pasukin ang tahanan ni Mr.Roick and Roll|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also owned Ventures Rural Bank, which he later sold and is now known as AMA Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.amabank.com.ph/TheCompany.asp?c=21|title = AMA Bank The Company|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his show “RJ Sunday Jam”, he is claimed to be the first to establish Teleradyo - a simulcast of radio on TV which was the model for [[ABS-CBN]]'s [[DZMM TeleRadyo]], the No.1 [[AM Broadcasting|AM]] radio station in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tomasinomagazine.com/ramon-rj-jacinto-musician-and-entrepreneur|title = Ramon RJ Jacinto musician and entrepreneur |date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bistro RJ, RJ Bar and RJ Bistro===
On July 25, 1986, Jacinto set up Bistro RJ, a rock and roll music lounge and restaurant located at [[Arnaiz Avenue]], [[Makati]], [[Metro Manila]] which became popular&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://entertainment.inquirer.net/104759/this-bistro-has-been-rockin-for-27-years#ixzz413NUuwhI|title = This bistro has been rockin’ for 27 years|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; for those who were into singing and dancing. At the time, live bands traveled abroad to make a living and the night circuit in [[Manila]] depended on piano bars and discos. Jacinto decided to hire live bands to provide financial opportunities as well as to revive the night life in the Philippines through live music.

Bistro RJ was renamed RJ Bar in 1991. It relocated to the Mandarin Oriental Manila Hotel in 1997 and later to [[Gil Puyat Avenue]] and subsequently Jupiter Street, all in Makati, Metro Manila.

In 2008, RJ Bar was renamed RJ Bistro and relocated to the [[Dusit Thani Group|Dusit Thani Hotel Manila]] in Makati, Metro Manila.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===RJ Guitars===
Jacinto developed an interest in music and he was particularly inclined to the guitar. RJ Guitars Store was launched in 1988 in Glorietta Mall (formerly Quad Mall), [[Makati City]]. While performing in his bistro, Jacinto felt exasperated about switching between a [[Fender Jazzmaster]] and a [[Gibson Les Paul]]. He decided to approach the legendary Filipino luthier Rudy Discipulo to make a guitar versatile enough to produce all the sounds he needed. Impressed by Discipulo's workmanship, Jacinto embarked on putting up a guitar manufacturing business. At present, there are 20 RJ Guitar Centers in the Philippines, providing RJ Guitar models, and other musical instruments as well as distributing [[Taylor Guitars]] and other brands from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.philstar.com/sunday-life/2014/07/06/1342803/rj-jacinto-designs-holy-grail-guitars|title = RJ Jacinto designs the ‘holy grail’ of guitars|date=July 6, 2014|access-date=September 5, 2018|website = |publisher=The Philippine Star |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, he established RJ Bacchus Japanese Guitar Factory, in partnership with Japanese guitar manufacturer Deviser. The 1,150 square meter factory located in [[Dasmariñas]], [[Cavite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://business.inquirer.net/242669/rj-guitars-broadcaster-rock-music-world|title=RJ Guitar’s ‘Broadcaster’ out to rock the music world|date=December 17, 2017|access-date=September 5, 2018|website=|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/sunday-life/2017/12/09/1766818/rjs-magic-bus-cavite|title=RJ's magic bus to Cavite|date=December 9, 2017|access-date=September 5, 2018|website=|publisher=The Philippine Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RJ Academy of Music===
The RJ Academy of Music began in 1994 when RJ Guitar Center became the licensee of the Music Institute of Los Angeles, California.

==Presidential appointments==
Since 2008, Jacinto is President and CEO of Philcomsat Holdings Corporation, a subsidiary of [[Philippine Communications Satellite Corporation]] (PHILCOMSAT). He is also Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Executive Committee of PHILCOMSAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.philstar.com/business/28648/philcomsat-owners-agree-unified-board-directors|title = Philcomsat owners agree on unified board of directors |date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 14, 2016, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] appointed Jacinto as Presidential Adviser on Economic Affairs and Information Technology Communications with the rank of Undersecretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/573659/news/nation/duterte-appoints-musician-rj-jacinto-as-adviser-on-ict-economy|title=Duterte appoints musician RJ Jacinto as adviser on ICT, economy|publisher=[[GMA News]]|last=Alvarez|first=Kathrina Charmaine|date=July 14, 2016|accessdate=July 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2016 [[Rodrigo Duterte presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]] of Duterte, Jacinto was among the celebrities who were actively supporting him. He created a campaign jingle for Duterte during [[Rodrigo_Duterte_presidential_campaign,_2016|his 2016 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/duterte-appoints-ramon-jacinto-as-presidential-adviser/|title=Duterte appoints Ramon Jacinto as presidential adviser|publisher=[[Manila Bulletin]]|last=Kabiling|first=Genalyn|date=July 14, 2016|accessdate=July 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rubber Board''' is a statutory body constituted by the [[Government of India]], under the [[Rubber Act]] 1947, for the overall development of the [[rubber]] industry in the country.

Head Office is in [[Kottayam]], [[Kerala]]

== Genesis of the Rubber Board ==
Commercial cultivation of natural rubber was introduced in [[India]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]], although the experimental efforts to grow rubber on a commercial scale in India were initiated as early as 1873 at the [[Botanical Gardens]], [[Calcutta]]. The first commercial Hevea plantations in India were established at [[Thattekadu]] in 1902. The importance of rubber production in India can a strategic and security reason had been realized by the [[government]] during the [[Second World War]] period. The rubber growers in India were encouraged to produce the maximum rubber required for the use during war. After the war, there were growing demands from the growers for setting up a permanent organisation to look after the interests of the industry. Thereupon the government set up an ad hoc committee in 1945 to study the situation and to make appropriate recommendation. On the recommendation of this ad hoc committee, the government passed the Rubber (Production and Marketing) Act, 1947, on 18 April 1947, and the [[Indian Rubber Board]] was constituted forthwith. The Rubber Production and Marketing (Amendment) Act, 1954, amended the name of the Board as The Rubber Board

== Legislative Enactments on Rubber ==
As noted above, a consideration of the post war natural rubber scenario prompted the Government of India to pass the Rubber (Production and Marketing) Act, 1947 to provide for the overall [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]] and development of the sector under its guidance and control. As envisaged in the Act, the Indian Rubber Board was set up as the statutory organization responsible for assisting the government in implementation of the various provisions of the Act. The Act which came into force on 18 April 1947 has since undergone many amendments.
The Rubber production and Marketing (Amendment) Act of 1954 which took effect on 1 August 1954 made some important changes in the constitution of the Board now renamed as The Rubber Board. It clearly defined the role of the Board in the development of the industry and in formulating and implementing necessary research and development programmes. This was followed by notification of the Rubber Rules, 1955 laying down guidelines for the Board to follow in carrying out the purposes of the Act. The Rules have been subjected to need based amendments from time to time.
The Rubber (Amendment) Act of 1960 made certain alterations in the rate and procedure of collection of cess on rubber. The Rubber (Amendment) Act of 1982 provided for the [[Central Government]] to appoint a part-time or whole time Chairman for the Board and, if necessary, an Executive Director for exercising such powers and performing such duties as may be prescribed or delegated to him by the Chairman. The 1994 Amendment refixed the maximum rate of cess that can be levied on rubber.

== Functions ==
The functions of the Board as defined under the Act are:

# To promote by such measures as it thinks fit the development of the rubber industry.
# Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision the measures referred to therein may provide for:
## undertaking, assisting or encouraging scientific, technological or economic research.
## training students in improved methods of planting, cultivation, manuring and spraying.
## the supply of technical advice to rubber growers
## improving the marketing of rubber.
## the collection of statistics from owners of estates, dealers and manufacturers.
## securing better working conditions and the provision and improvement of amenities and incentives to workers.
## carrying out any other duties which may be vested with the Board as per rules made under this Act.
# It shall also be the duty of the Board:
## to advise the Central Government on all matters relating to the development of the rubber industry, including the import and export of rubber.
## to advise the Central Government with regard to participation in any international conference or scheme relating to rubber.
## to submit to the Central Government and such other authorities as may be prescribed, half yearly reports on its activities and the working of this Act, and
## to prepare and furnish such other reports relating to the rubber industry as may be required by the Central Government from time to time.

==Rubber Production Department==
The Department headed by the Rubber Production Commissioner is responsible for planning, formulation and implementation of schemes for improvement and expansion of rubber cultivation and production. Extension/advisory service, supplies of inputs, demonstration and training for small growers etc. are also undertaken by the RP Department.
There is a well structured field establishment set up under the Rubber Production Department which renders free advisory and extension services to rubber growers on all aspects of rubber cultivation, production, processing and marketing and simultaneously attends to implementation of various development schemes as well. The set up comprises four Zonal Offices, 44 Regional Offices and 191 Field Offices located at all important rubber growing centers. 
The Rubber Production Department formulates and implements all schemes relating to cultivation and production, most schemes relating to processing and the schemes for promoting and assisting small holders’ self-help groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Board|first=Rubber|title=Rubber Production Department|url=http://www.rubberboard.org.in|work=official|publisher=Rubber Board|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development strategy for natural rubber production has to keep in view the following essential requirements:
• Optimisation of production from existing plantations through replanting with improved cultivars and better agro management
• Expansion of cultivation in traditional plantation areas, identification of suitable non-traditional areas that are fit for economic production and extension of cultivation to such areas
• Reduction of cost of production to withstand challenges from competing crops, synthetic substitutes and cheap imports
• Upgradation of quality of produce to meet the increasingly exacting demands of consuming industries
• Formation and effective working of small holders’ self-help groups to ensure informed community participation to create infrastructure to facilitate organised production, processing and marketing chains to gain maximum returns. The approach also takes care of the needs of the resource poor farmers who also got an opportunity not only to derive benefits offered under various schemes but to contribute to the decision making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Board|first=Rubber|title=Rubber Production Department|url=http://www.rubberboard.org.in|work=official|publisher=Rubber board|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The important development schemes and activities undertaken through the Department are the following:

# Rubber Plantation Development Scheme.
# Production and distribution of improved planting materials.
# Advisory and extension services to growers.
# Demonstration of scientific planting and production.
# Supplies of equipment and materials requiring popularisation.
# Identification of non-traditional areas suitable for rubber and planning and undertaking activities for its promotion in such areas.
# Schemes for productivity enhancement in small holdings
# Schemes for improvement of quality of small holder rubber.
# Schemes for extra income generation form rubber plantations - Apiculture
# Block planting, group planting etc. for promotion of rubber among scheduled caste/scheduled tribe members.
# Promotion of activities of voluntary associations(Rubber Producers' Societies) and self-help groups among small growers.
# Training of tappers.

The central office of the Department functions at the Board's central office in [[Kottayam]]. The field services are rendered through Zonal/Regional offices and Field Offices. Other establishments are nurseries, demonstration and training centers and tappers training schools.

== International cooperation ==

The '''secretariat''' of an organization is the department that fulfils its [[Central administration|central administrative]] or [[General Secretary|general secretary]] duties. The term is especially associated with [[government]]s and [[intergovernmental organization]]s such as the [[United Nations Secretariat|United Nations]], although some [[non-governmental organization]]s (for example, the [[International Organization for Standardization]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/contact.htm Contact ISO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524173200/http://www.iso.org/iso/contact.htm |date=2012-05-24 }}, official web site of ISO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/about.htm About ISO], official web site of ISO.&lt;/ref&gt;) also refer to their administrative department as their secretariat. The building or office complex that houses such a department may also be referred to as its secretariat or secretariat building.

In some cases, the secretariat is not a bureaucratic organ, but one which includes a certain organization run by all its members who collectively help to organize the larger group, such as the secretariat of the [[International of Anarchist Federations]], which is an office that rotates irregularly between its member Federations.

The [[Zhongshu Sheng]] or simply the Secretariat was one department in the [[Three Departments and Six Ministries]] structure in the [[history of China]].

'''Sense and respond''' has been used in [[control theory]] for several decades, primarily in [[closed system]]s such as refineries where comparisons are made between measurements and desired values, and system settings are adjusted to narrow the gap between the two. Since  the early 1980s, sense and respond has also been used to describe the behavior of certain open systems. 

Sense and respond is based on [[Lean manufacturing|lean principles]] and follows URSLIMM:
*U - understand customer value
*R - remove waste
*S - standardize
*L - learn by doing
*I - involve everyone
*M - measure what matters
*M - manage performance visually

The term "sense and respond" as a business concept was used in a 1992 [[American Management Association]] ''Management Review'' article by [[Stephan H. Haeckel]].  It was Developed by Haeckel at [[IBM]]’s Advanced Business Institute.

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Shire location in Lexington MA.jpg|thumb|right|Location in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]], [[United States|USA]]]]
Shire was founded in 1986 in the UK by four entrepreneurs: Harry Stratford, Dennis Stephens, Peter Moriarty, and Geoff Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/Industry/article830604.ece|title=Shire is one of the big stars|publisher=Sunday Times|date=27 November 2011|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the management of [[Rolf Stahel]] Shire was first listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] in 1996. Shire's initial products were calcium supplements ([[Calcichew-D3|Calcichew-D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]) for patients seeking to treat or prevent osteoporosis. In 1997 the company acquired Pharmavene for £105 million in order to access Pharmavene's drug delivery methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/shire-buys-us-drugs-delivery-firm-for-pounds-105m-1280736.html|title=Shire buys US drugs delivery firm for pounds 105m|author=Grimond, Magnus |date=1997-02-26 | work=The Independent|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same year Shire acquired Richwood Pharmaceutical Company, forming Shire-Richwood Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/investment-column-shire-focuses-on-buying-richwood-1243915.html|title=Investment Column: Shire focuses on buying Richwood|author=Grimond, Magnus|date=1997-08-04 | work=The Independent|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000 to 2009===
In 2001 the company acquired Biochem Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2717558/Canadians-give-go-ahead-for-Shire-takeover-of-BioChem.html|title=Canadians give go-ahead for Shire takeover of BioChem|author=Dunne, Helen |date=2001-05-10 | work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shire's next acquisition didn't come until 2005 when it acquired Transkaryotic Therapeutics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readabstracts.com/Business-international/UK-drug-maker-agrees-to-buy-Transkaryotic-Hedge-Funds-vex-a-Shire-takeover-of-Transkaryotic.html|title=U.K. drug maker agrees to buy Transkaryotic|date=|work=readabstracts.com|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two years later - in 2007 - New River Pharmaceuticals Inc, for a then company record of $2.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmatimes.com/mobile/07-02-21/Shire_buys_New_River_Pharmaceuticals_for_2_6_billion.aspx|title=Shire buys New River Pharmaceuticals for $2.6 billion|date=|work=pharmatimes.com|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the purchase of New River, Shire gained access and ownership of [[Vyvanse]]. A year later the company acquired the German company [[Jerini]], for $521 million.

In 2008, in reaction to new taxation measures announced by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the treatment of royalties on patents, the company moved its tax domicile to [[Dublin]], Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2008/0416/business/shire-moves-to-ireland-for-tax-60386.html Shire moves to Ireland for tax] Irish Examiner, April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 onwards ===
2010 saw a change in company strategy, with the company seeking to expand through mergers and acquisitions - culminating in the company becoming one of the most acquisitive in the industry. In 2010 the company acquired [[Movetis]], a Belgian company focusing on gastrointestinal products for $565 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/shire-forges-565m-buyout-deal-movetis/2010-08-03|title=Shire forges $565M buyout deal for Movetis|date=|work=FierceBiotech|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a year later it acquired regenerative medicine manufacturer Advanced BioHealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Grogan, Kevin | date = 2011-05-18 | title = Shire swoops to buy Advanced BioHealing | url=http://www.pharmatimes.com/article/11-05-18/Shire_swoops_to_buy_Advanced_BioHealing.aspx | work=pharmatimes.com | accessdate=22 March 2016 | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the company acquired FerroKin BioSciences for $325 million along with FerroKins lead iron chelator - FBS0701.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/15/us-shire-idUSBRE82E0K520120315|title=Shire to buy U.S. biotech firm for up to $325 million|author=Reuters Editorial|date=15 March 2012|work=Reuters|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2013 saw the company complete its highest number of acquisitions with Lotus Tissue Repair, Inc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2907">The '''Society of Incorporated Accountants''', founded in 1885 as the '''Society of Accountants''', was a [[professional association]] of [[accountants]] in [[England]]. It was known from 1908 to 1954 as the '''Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors''', and from 1954 to 1957 as the Society of Incorporated Accountants.

==History==
The Society of Accountants was established in 1885, initially in reaction to the restrictive practices of the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] (ICAEW), founded in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/gh/ghinfo9.htm Records of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and its predecessor bodies at Guildhall Library], [[Guildhall Library]]&lt;/ref&gt; Members were known as 'Incorporated Accountants'.&lt;ref name=journal&gt;[http://www.icaew.com/en/library/subject-gateways/accounting-history/resources/accountancy-ancestors/incorporated%20accountants%20journal Accountancy Ancestors - Incorporated Accountants' Journal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001053959/http://www.icaew.com/en/library/subject-gateways/accounting-history/resources/accountancy-ancestors/incorporated%20accountants%20journal |date=2011-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, members were mainly elected by the Society's Council, but in 1889 examinations were introduced and the Society established itself as an examining body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icaew.com/en/library/subject-gateways/accounting-history/guides/knowledge-guide-to-icaew-examination-papers/society-of-incorporated-accountants-and-auditors-examinations Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors examinations]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889 the Society began publishing a quarterly journal ''Incorporated Accountants' Journal'', which became a monthly in 1895 and was renamed ''Accountancy'' in 1938. The Society was housed at [[Two Temple Place]] from 1928 to 1959. In 1957 it merged with the ICAEW.&lt;ref name=journal/&gt;

'''''The Complete TurtleTrader: How 23 Novice Investors Became Overnight Millionaires''''' (2009) is an [[international bestseller]] written by [[Michael Covel]].&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;Pressley, James. [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ab8tmB7aIGQE&amp;refer=home Richard Dennis, Prince of Chicago Pit, Taught Turtles to Trade]. ''Bloomberg''.

==Background==
In 1994, Covel picked up an issue of ''[[Financial World]]'' and skimmed through an article titled "Wall Street's Top Players."&lt;ref name=thecompleteturtletrader&gt;{{cite book |title=The Complete TurtleTrader: How 23 Novice Investors Became Overnight Millionaires |last=Covel |first=Michael W. |authorlink= |year=2009 |publisher=HarperBusiness |location= |isbn=0061241717 |page= |pages=288 |url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Complete-TurtleTrader-Investors-Millionaires/dp/0061241717/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344465762&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+complete+turtletrader}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst famous investors like [[George Soros]] and [[Julian Robertson]], Covel noticed a name he did not recognize at 25th on the list: R. Jerry Parker, who stated that he was trained as a "Turtle" by [[Richard Dennis]] (another name Covel did not recognize).&lt;ref name=thecompleteturtletrader/&gt; Parker was the only investor in the top hundred advertised as being "trained," and as an investor himself, Covel found this story intriguing.&lt;ref name=thecompleteturtletrader/&gt;

==Synopsis==
Richard Dennis made over $200 million as a trader.&lt;ref name=futures&gt;Pardo, Robert. [http://www.futuresmag.com/2007/11/15/the-complete-turtletrader-the-legend-the-lessons-t The Complete TurtleTrader: The Legend, the Lessons, the Results]. ''Futures Magazine''. November 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; After having a debate with his partner, William Eckhardt, about whether trading is learnable or an inborn talent, they proposed an experiment where they would spend two weeks training novices in the science of trading and then give them each $1 million to invest.&lt;ref name=thecompleteturtletrader/&gt; The inspiration came from a trip Dennis took to a turtle-breeding farm in Singapore, stating, "We are going to grow traders just like they grow turtles."&lt;ref name="Reprint from the Wall Street Journal"&gt; [http://turtletrader.com/images/wsj_turtle_article.pdf Reprint from the Wall Street Journal] ''Turtle Trader''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although each of the 1,000 applicants went through a rigorous application process designed to test their intelligence, ability to manage risk and mathematical skills, the makeup of the chosen Turtles differed greatly; they included a Czechoslovakian-born [[blackjack]] master, a [[Dungeons and Dragons]] game designer, an [[evangelical]] accountant, a [[Harvard Business School|Harvard MBA]], a [[U.S. Air Force]] pilot and a former pianist.&lt;ref name=bloomberg/&gt; The Turtles would go on to gross over $150 million in four years.&lt;ref name=goldseek&gt;Nystrom, Michael.

==Release and reception==
''The Complete TurtleTrader'' was Covel’s second bestseller and ''[[Futures (magazine)|Stocks, Futures, Options Magazine]]'' named ''The Complete TurtleTrader'' as one of 2007’s top 10 trading, investing and personal finance books.&lt;ref name=michaelcovel&gt;[http://www.michaelcovel.com/2007/12/06/top-10-books-of-2007 Top 10 Books of 2007] ''Michael Covel''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek|Bloomberg]]'' noted that the book was worthy of a spot on any investor’s shelf and ''[[The Hindu]]'' called ''The Complete TurtleTrader'' “exciting and educative.”&lt;ref name=bloomberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=hindureview&gt;Murali, D.

The following is a partial '''timeline of [[Crayola]]'s history'''.  It covers the Crayola brand of marking utensils, as well as the history of [[Binney &amp; Smith]], the company that created the brand and is currently a subsidiary of [[Hallmark Cards]] known as [[Crayola LLC]].

{{TOC right}}

==List of Events==

===1864–1900===
*'''1864:''' Joseph Binney founds Peekskill Chemical Works in [[Upstate New York]] for producing [[carbon black]].
*'''1880:''' Joseph Binney sets up headquarters in [[New York City]], joined by son [[Edwin Binney]] and nephew [[C. Harold Smith]].
*'''1885:''' Joseph Binney retires; Edwin and C. Harold Smith, form a partnership and call their company [[Binney &amp; Smith]]. Early products include red [[oxide]] [[pigment]] used in [[barn (building)|barn]] paint and carbon black used for [[automobile|car]] [[tire]]s. During this time, Binney &amp; Smith took an active role in the development and production of carbon black from [[natural gas]], after natural gas deposits were found throughout [[Pennsylvania]].
*'''1889:''' [[Binney &amp; Smith]] made yellow [[oxide]] [[pigment]]. Now there are three colors: [[Carbon black]], yellow, and red.

===1900–1950===
*'''1900:''' The company begins producing [[slate (writing)|slate]] [[school]] [[pencil]]s in its newly opened [[Easton, Pennsylvania]] [[mill (factory)|mill]]. Their carbon black wins the Gold Medal at the Paris Exposition.
*'''1902:''' "Binney &amp; Smith Company" is formed September 30, in Easton, Pennsylvania, and serves as general distributor for several carbon black producers, introducing Carbon black to other countries.  This also marks their first crayon product, the industry crayon "Staonal" in black. This crayon precedes the Crayola brand by a full year and still exists to this year.
*'''1903:''' Noticing a need for safe, quality, and affordable [[wax crayon]]s, the company produces their first boxes of crayons from the No. 30 box containing 30 unwrapped colors to the No. 51 box of 28 wrapped colors. The No. 54 box contains 8 classic colors and the first one sells for a nickel. A total of 40 colors are introduced including [[Black]], [[Blue]], [[Brown]], Burnt Sienna, Burnt Umber (later retired in 1949), Celestial Blue (later retired in 1944), Charcoal Gray (later retired in 1910), Copper, Dark Blue (later Prussian Blue then Midnight Blue), Dark Green (later Pine Green), English Vermillion (later retired in 1935), Flesh Tint (later Flesh then Peach), Gold, Golden Ochre (later Gold Ochre then Maize, later retired in 1990) [[Green]], Indian Red (later Chestnut), Lemon Yellow (was once later Light Yellow, later retired in 1990), Light Blue (was once later Cobalt Blue, later retired in 1958), Madder Lake (later retired in 1935), Medium Green (later retired in 1939), Medium Yellow (later Goldenrod), Olive Green, [[Orange (colour)|Orange]], Permanent Geranium Lake (later retired in 1910), Permanent Magenta (later Magenta), Raw Sienna, Raw Umber (later retired in 1990), [[Red]], Rose Pink (later Carnation Pink), Sea Green, Sepia, Silver, Ultramarine Blue (later retired in 1958), [[Van Dyke brown]] (later retired in 1910), Venetian Red (later retired in 1949), [[Violet (color)|Violet]], White, and [[Yellow]].
*'''1904:''' Binney &amp; Smith wins the Gold Medal during the April 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. Their entry was actually for their An-Du-Septic dustless chalk, but it was the foundation of their "Gold Medal" packaging in which they featured the gold medal on the front of their crayon boxes for the next 50 or so years. Given that this award wasn't given out until April 1904 and Crayola had been selling since August 1903, it is a misconception that the famous box shown on the postage stamp and in numerous other historical articles and web pages is "the" actual first design of their Crayola boxes because the box shown in all of those pictures has that Gold Medal on the front.
*'''1905:''' Binney redesigns their 8-color assortment to use the famous "Gold Medal" label and design.  They also renamed the box to be the No. 8, following and earlier such introduction by the Franklin Mfg. Co. for their Rainbow line of crayons.  This first and only Gold Medal box used the Eagle side of the Gold Medal and was the only assortment size to use this side of the medal as it was changed to the other side before they expanded the line to other assortment sizes in 1910.  This also marks the year that they introduced Spectra, a pastel crayon line.
*'''1907:''' Binney &amp; Smith partnered with Milton Bradley to product the Crayola No. 77 assortment box with Milton Bradley printed on the box also.
*'''1908:''' Binney &amp; Smith partnered with Littlefield Maps to make a special color assortment of their Rubens-Crayola No. 12 box with special Biblical colors pasted on the back to accommodate church work on their Old Testament maps.
*'''1909:''' Binney &amp; Smith launched their Durel line of pressed crayons
*'''1910:'''
**Binney &amp; Smith expands their Gold Medal line to include the debut of their No. 16 box (which also followed an earlier debut of a 16-color assortment by Franklin Mfg. Co.).  They also discontinued many of their original boxes in favor of standardizing more to this Gold Medal line.
**Three crayon colors are discontinued including Charcoal Gray, Permanent Geranium Lake, and Van Dyke Brown.
**Raw Sienna becomes unavailable until 1958.
*'''1911:''' Binney &amp; Smith launch their Cerola brand of crayons targeted toward the lower end quality but more affordable markets
*'''1912:''' Binney &amp; Smith's carbon black is first used on tires to make black tires.  They also launched their Cerata brand of crayons.
*'''1913:''' Marks the launch of the Little Folks outfit boxes (Nos. 25 &amp; 50) along with a Picture Tracer box.
*'''1915:''' The Boston crayon line debuts.  This also marks the discontinuation of the No. 101 assortment box that contained Gold, Silver and Copper crayon colors.  While Gold and Silver was available as a bulk purchase, these three original colors couldn't be found on a retail assortment box for the next 30 years. Copper goes away until 1958.
*'''1919:''' The design of their Gold Medal boxes is changed to drop the Paris reference.  They also launch their No. 88 8-color tins.
*'''1920:''' Perma Pressed Sharpenable Fine Art Crayons are added to the growing [[product line]], which also includes new Artista brand paints.

While attractive and theme driven, they later concluded that the higher cost made these some of their least successful products.
*'''1923:''' Corporate offices move from 81–83 Fulton St. to 41 East 42nd Street in [[New York City]].
*'''1924:''' Perma and Tiny Tot crayon lines debut.

'''WiseWindow''' is a private data provider of unstructured "[[big data]]" sentiment, used in real-time [[business intelligence]]. The company, now part of [[KPMG]], is based in [[Irvine, California]] and has 25 full-time employees. WiseWindow's patented [[web analytics]] system, [[mass opinion|Mass Opinion]] Business Intelligence (MOBI) analyzes and [[classification|classifies]] comments made online and distills the information into a pre-defined, structured database. The company has shown "the predictive value of [[cluster analysis]] by applying it to [[social media]] content."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130123090535/http://www.forbes.com/2010/07/26/cluster-analysis-predictions-technology-social-media.html The Predictive Power Of Social Media - Forbes.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==

WiseWindow’s MOBI is used by companies in the airline, alcoholic beverage, automotive, consumer electronic, health care, news media, entertainment, political and retail industries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2010/01/social-media-is-a-poor-label-f.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tmcnet.com/voip/0410/a-look-into-the-mind-wisewindow-leverages-open-source-cloud-computing-to-gauge-opinions.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

MOBI VIBES 3.0 visualization tools were launched in November 2011. MOBI combines cloud computing, deep website crawling, relevance recognition and statistical natural language analysis to allow business decision makers to quickly get a real-time look at their brands and their competitive set. By collecting, analyzing and classifying the billions of unbiased consumer comments made online annually from across the web, MOBI distills the data into a usable form providing an up-to-the-minute view of consumer sentiment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.  It lets users view sentiment data by demographic, geographic and attitudinal segment, and provides a normalized benchmark of sentiment within a vertical market through its MOBI Sentiment Index.

== History ==
WiseWindow began developing its core technology in 2007, based on the work of its founder, Rajiv Dulapet, while he was a research fellow at Stanford University. The premise of WiseWindow is to utilize mass opinions expressed on the Internet to develop business intelligence that is useful to companies and to develop more accurate forecasts of consumer behavior.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisewindow.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=49&amp;Itemid=106&lt;/ref&gt;

WiseWindow acquired the marketing research firm Core Strategies in 2009, which was founded by Marshall Toplansky. With the acquisition, the company adapted and productized its technology to be able to  calibrate  Mass Opinion Business Intelligence (MOBI) data with traditional forms of quantitative and qualitative market research, and provide on-going tracking metrics that are of use to marketers and operating management within client companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pr.com/press-release/132492&lt;/ref&gt;

KPMG acquired Wise Window in April, 2012.  The three co-founders have integrated Wise Window's MOBI technology into KPMG's data analytics practice. The financial terms of the acquisition were not made public.

== Partnerships ==
During the 2010 mid-term elections WiseWindow partnered with political blog [[The Daily Beast]] to present the "Election Oracle" which used MOBI technology to accurately predict 36 of the 37 Senate races and 98% of the House races.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-11-08/midterm-election-results-internet-predicted-outcomes/ Midterm Election Results: Internet Predicted Outcomes - The Daily Beast&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They also teamed up with The Daily Beast to create the "Oscar Oracle" to predict the outcome of the 2011 Academy Awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsmaker/awards-countdown/?cid=sexybeast:mainpromo1 Awards Countdown - The Daily Beast&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wise Window election data is being used by both Reuters and CNN for the 2012 presidential election.

== Awards ==
