{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}

In manufacturing, an '''airshaft''' is a device used for handling winding reels in the processing of [[web-fed]] materials, such as continuous-process [[printing press]]es.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.convertech.com/converting-terminology-glossary/&lt;/ref&gt;

Airshafts—also called Air Expanding shafts—are used in the manufacturing processes for fitting into a core onto which materials such as paper, card and plastic film are wound. An airshaft is designed so that, on fitting into a core, it can be readily expanded, thereby achieving a quick and firm attachment, it may also be easily deflated to facilitate easy withdrawal of the shaft after winding of product is complete. Their efficient design makes them ideal for mounting onto bearing housings to enable the winding or unwinding of rolls of stock material with the minimum of equipment down time. The advantage of using an airshaft is its ability to grip the core, without damage, whilst providing a positive interface to control the web via motors &amp; brakes. Airshafts are available as either lug type (with bladder down the centre) or strip type (bladders on the periphery of the shaft).

Air shafts are used on many [[converting]] machines. An example of one of these machines is a [[Roll slitting|slitting machine]] or slitter rewinder which is used to cut or slit large rolls of material into smaller rollers.

Air shaft is a machine part or shaft which tightens the core or roll on filling air.
Air Shafts are of two types 
1) Contains Inflatable Rubber tube inside also called Lug shafts.
2) Which contains  bladder multiple outside also called Multi-tube Shaft .
 In Lugs type Air shaft, shaft consist of air bladder inside it. It is manufactured using Aluminium or Iron pipe as outer pipe in which there are u-shaped slot are there in which lugs are fitted manually. Then Inflatable bladder placed inside pipe below lugs. Then bladder is connected  using a brass air valve. So, when we fill air using Air valve the bladder inflated and lugs comes out of shafts body (pipe) and tights the core in which shafts is placed.

In Multi tube Air Shafts there are small flat tubes placed outside the body of shafts which get in round shapes on filling air in it using Brass Air Valve and Lugs comes out of body and tight the core.

 These times  Air Shafts &amp; Multi tube Shafts are finding very important placed in industries where they use any kind of cores or rolls. Its main application is on Printing-Packaging industries &amp; Textile Industries.

'''Alban Schachleiter''' (20 January 1861 – 20 June 1937) was a Roman Catholic [[Benedictine]] monk and musicologist. He was closely associated with the [[Nazis]], and with [[Adolf Hitler]] personally.

Schachleiter first became closely associated  with the NSDAP, and with Hitler, in late 1922. Originally from Mainz, he served as the long-time abbot of the [[Emmaus monastery|Emmaus]] monastery in Prague before being forced out of that position in late 1918 following the establishment of the new Czechoslovak state.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} After brief stays at several Austrian monasteries, including St. Florian near [[Linz]], by early 1920 he was at Munich's [[St. Boniface's Abbey, Munich|St. Boniface's Abbey]].  By September 1922 he was noticed for the radicalism of his anti-Semitic agitation and his involvement with groups like the ''volkisch'' Bund Bayern und Reich.  He cultivated connections with members of Munich's Catholic elite, including [[w:de:Karl Alexander von Müller]], professor of history at the University of Munich, and Helene Raff, whose father was the composer [[Joachim Raff]]. With Muller he discussed politics and [[Gregorian chant]]. Through these connections he first met Hitler in late 1922; the pair were observed by both Muller and [[Ernst Hanfstaengl]] engaging in lively and lengthy conversation.  It was the beginning of a relationship that ended only with Schachleiter's death in 1937. The meeting opened the way for Schachleiter to play an important propagandist role on behalf of the NSDAP in the summer of 1923.

Following the commemorative activities of 10 June 1923—which included a massive rally in honour  of [[Albert Leo Schlageter]], staged on [[Königsplatz, Munich|Munich's Konigsplatz]] and attended by 20-30000 activists—a Catholic memorial Mass was held immediately after the rally in St. Boniface Abbey, organised exclusively by the NSDAP, which was presided over by Schachleiter. Hanfstaengl had sketched out for Hitler the symbolic impact a related Catholic-Nazi Mass for Schlagater would have on Munich's Catholic population—Schachleiter could also consecrate the standards of the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]]. Hitler quickly agreed. Schachleiter delivered a eulogistic sermon that was remembered as having a powerful impact—a young and devoutly pious [[Heinrich Himmler]] joined the NSDAP in the wake of Schachleiters eulogy.&lt;ref&gt;Catholicism and the Roots of Nazism, Hastings p.133&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later however, Schachleiter was writing to [[Oswald Spengler]] lamenting the impact of [[Erich Ludendorff]] and his anti-Catholic followers on the movement: following the refounding of the NSDAP in early 1925 the stronghold of the Nazi movement in Bavaria would no longer be Munich but rather the Protestant regions of [[Middle Franconia|Mittel]]- and [[Oberfranken]]. Schachleiter increasingly distanced himself  from the NSDAP in the mid-1920s, although he maintained an idealised image of Hitler personally.

Schachleiter continued for years to be angry at Ludendorff's anti-Catholic crusade following the [[Beer Hall putsch|putsch]] of November 1923. After maintaining his weekly Schola Gregoriana at the [[Allerheiligen-Hofkirche]] in Munich until 1930, he then moved to a newly built country house in Bad Feilnbach where he was still living when Hitler came to power in 1933. In late spring Schachleiter wrote to [[Michael von Faulhaber|Cardinal Faulhaber]]: "It seems to me to be a catastrophe that the Holy Church stands aloof from the new freedom movement, whose triumph I foresaw, and that the massive uprising of the  ''volk'', which is now lifting our poor fatherland out of its misery and shame, may well go down in history as a triumph of [[Protestantism]]." &lt;ref&gt;Derek Hastings, p.170&lt;/ref&gt; Faulhaber forbade Schachleiter from performing Masses within the archdiocese, and Schachleiter reluctantly refused Hitler's request for him to come to Berlin on 20 March 1933 to perform a personal Mass for the fuhrer. Hitler  visited in mid-May to personally congratulate Schachleiter on his 50th anniversary as a Benedictine. His invitation to sit among the Nazi dignitaries at the [[Nuremberg]] party rally in 1934, which he accepted, (and an enduring image through [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''), showed him "on the sidelines as the Nazis' striking, yet thoroughly secularized, performative aesthetic played out before him." &lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p.172&lt;/ref&gt;
 
From 1933-1936 Schachleiter spent much energy campaigning against what he saw as peripheral Nazi personalities directing the Nazis in an anti-Catholic and anti-Christian direction—and particularly the ideology advanced by [[Alfred Rosenberg]]. Schachleiter regarded this as a restraint on a renewal of wide-ranging Catholic support for the NSDAP. Schachleiter eventually wrote more than two dozen appeals to a variety of Nazi officials, including [[Hans Lammers]], but was ignored. In September 1936 he admitted privately to a friend that, "a believing Christian can no longer participate [in the NSDAP]; they do not want believing Christians in the party." Publicly he continued to profess loyalty to the Führer and to the church.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p.173&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following his death in June 1937 the Nazis ordered a state funeral arranged by Bavarian minister-president [[Ludwig Siebert (Nazi)|Ludwig Siebert]]. A year later the editorial leadership of the ''[[Münchener Beobachter|Beobachter]]'' refused attempts to publish official commemorations. According to historian Derek Hastings, by 1937 Schachleiter's vision of a renewed Catholic-Nazi synthesis had become increasingly marginal.

The '''American Association of Physics Teachers''' ('''AAPT''') was founded in 1930 for the purpose of "dissemination of knowledge of physics, particularly by way of teaching."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapt.org/aboutaapt/ About AAPT&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 10,000 members that reside in over 30 countries. AAPT publications include two [[peer-reviewed journal]]s, the ''[[American Journal of Physics]]'' and ''[[The Physics Teacher]]''. The association has two annual National Meetings (winter and summer) and has regional sections with their own meetings and organization. The association also offers grants and awards for physics educators, including the Richtmyer Memorial Award,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapt.org/Programs/awards/richtmyer.cfm Richtmeyer Memorial Award, AAPT website]&lt;/ref&gt; and programs and contests for physics educators and students. It is headquartered at the American Center for Physics in [[College Park, Maryland]].

==History==
The American Association of Physics Teachers was founded on December 31, 1930, when forty-five physicists held a meeting during the joint [[American Physical Society|APS]]-AAAS meeting in Cleveland specifically for that purpose.

The AAPT became a founding member of the [[American Institute of Physics]] after the other founding members were convinced of the stability of the AAPT itself after a new constitution for the AAPT was agreed upon.

==Contests==
The AAPT sponsors a number of competitions. The [[Physics Bowl]], [[Six Flags]]' [[roller coaster]] contest, and the US Physics Team are just a few. The US physics team is determined by two preliminary exams and a week and a half long "boot camp." Each year, five members are selected to compete against dozens of countries in the [[International Physics Olympiad]] (IPHO).

{{Antennas|systems}}

'''Antenna farm''' or '''satellite dish farm''' or just '''dish farm''' are terms used to describe an area dedicated to [[television]] or [[radio]] [[telecommunications]] transmitting or receiving antenna equipment, such as [[C band (IEEE)|C]], [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;]] or [[Ka band|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[Band (radio)|band]] [[satellite dish antenna]]s, [[UHF]]/[[VHF]]/[[AM broadcasting|AM]]/[[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[transmitter]] towers or mobile [[cell tower]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Encarta - antenna farm |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561537876/antenna_farm.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKQy6iM?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561537876/antenna_farm.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Google Book Search]] - [https://books.google.com/books?id=xlZJno4LsLwC&amp;pg=PT71&amp;dq=Antenna+farm&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=SshGSvyxOI_wyASWr_VR&amp;client=opera Wireless telecom FAQs By Clint Smith]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Google Book Search]] - [https://books.google.com/books?id=s3LR9ZlSv-4C&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=antenna+farm&amp;ei=s5UQStGfIYmkzATSoM3rBw&amp;client=opera Wireless Crash Course By Paul Bedell]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiber-optics.info/articles/l-band_satellite_transport Fiber-Optics.Info - L-Band Satellite Transport]&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the term "antenna farm" is uncertain, but it dates to at least the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;"Five Ideco Towers Take the Punishment at the Nation's Most Antenna Farm," Broadcasting-Telecasting, 14 October 1957, 79. http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1957/1957-10-14-BC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In telecom circles, any area with more than three antennas could be referred to as an antenna farm. In the case of an AM broadcasting station ([[mediumwave]] and [[longwave]], occasionally [[shortwave]]), the multiple [[mast radiator]]s may all be part of an antenna system for a single station, while for VHF and UHF the site may be under [[joint venture|joint management]].  Alternatively, a single tower with many separate antennas is often called a "[[candelabra]] tower".&lt;ref&gt;Google Book Search - [https://books.google.com/books?id=xTSNJhVlHGgC&amp;pg=PT977&amp;dq=candelabra+tower&amp;num=100&amp;ei=IJoQSoe2DpHGzATV4NCVAQ&amp;client=opera Antenna engineering handbook By Richard Clayton Johnson, Henry Jasik]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety and security ==

Commercial antenna farms are managed by [[radio station]]s, [[television station]]s, satellite [[Earth station#Telecommunications port|teleport]]s or military organizations and are mostly very [[security|secure]] facilities with access limited to [[broadcast engineer]]s, [[RF engineering|RF engineer]]s or [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] [[Engineering technician|technician]]s.  This is not only for the physical security of the location (including preventing [[Electrical equipment|equipment]]/[[metal theft]]), but also for safety, as there may be a [[radiation]] hazard unless stations are powered-down.

== Locations ==
[[Image:Mt Wilson antenna farm winter.jpeg|thumb|right|Antennas on [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]], covered in ice]]
Where [[terrain]] allows, [[summit|mountaintop]] sites are very attractive for non-AM [[Radio broadcasting|broadcast station]]s and others, because it increases the stations' [[height above average terrain]], allowing them to reach further by avoiding obstructions on the ground, and by increasing the [[radio horizon]].  With a clearer [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] in both cases, more signal can be received.  While the same is true of a very tall tower, such towers are expensive, dangerous, and difficult to access the top of, and may collect and drop large amounts of ice in winter, or even [[Structural failure|collapse]] in a severe ice storm and/or high winds.  Multiple small towers also allow stations to have backup facilities co-located on each other's towers for [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]].

Satellite antenna farms are usually located at remote locations, far away from urban development, especially high rise buildings or airplane flight paths, to avoid and minimize disruption to transmission and reception, and so as to not be an eyesore. Although most radio and TV stations are in fierce competition with each other in their broadcast markets, they will often locate their broadcasting antennas very near each other, and in some cases, will even share land or towers with each other, in the interests of space, land availability, and the cost of putting a transmission building on top of a mountain.

===In the United States===
[[Image:Erdfunkstelle Raisting 3.jpg|260px|thumb|right|The dish farm at the [[Raisting Satellite Earth Station]] complex and Telehouse, Germany's largest satellite communications facility in [[Raisting]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Penobscot Hill.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The [[antenna farm]] on [[Penobscot Knob]] before the coollapse of [[WNEP-TV]]'s tower]] --&gt;

Most [[metropolitan area]]s have at least one antenna farm, such as [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]] in [[Greater Los Angeles area|greater Los Angeles]] (seen at right), [[Sweat Mountain]] in [[metro Atlanta]], [[Farnsworth Peak]] for the [[Salt Lake Valley]], [[Riverview, Florida|Riverview]] in [[Tampa]], Florida, [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]'s [[Woodberry, Baltimore#Television Hill|Television Hill]] and [[Slide Mountain (Nevada)|Slide Mountain]] ([[Mt. Rose Ski Tahoe|Mount Rose ski area]]) in the [[Reno]]/[[Lake Tahoe|Tahoe]] area.  Some cities instead have combined many stations onto one tower, often through [[diplexer]]s into just one or two antennas, such as atop the [[Empire State Building]] in [[New York metropolitan area|New York]], the landmark [[Sutro Tower]] of [[San Francisco]], or the huge [[Miami Gardens]] tower serving the [[south Florida metropolitan area|Miami and Fort Lauderdale region]]. [[Cleveland, Ohio]] has its antenna farm in the suburb of [[Parma, Ohio]] due to Parma's high elevation. In central [[Oklahoma City]] most of the city's media outlets transmitter and tower facilities are located between the [[Kilpatrick Turnpike]] to the south and [[Interstate 44]] to the north, Broadway Extension to the west and [[Interstate 35]] to the east with Britton Road being the central thoroughfare. In addition, all three network affiliates and one of the 3 major radio groups have their studio facilities located within the [[Oklahoma City]] tower farm.

In the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of the Eastern United States, [[Poor Mountain]] serves most of the FM and TV stations in the [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]]/[[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]] market. [[Holston Mountain]] in upper East Tennessee is home to most of the FM and TV stations in the Tri-Cities ([[Bristol, Virginia]]-[[Kingsport, Tennessee]]-[[Johnson City, Tennessee]]) DMA.  Other examples are [[Signal Mountain, Tennessee|Signal Mountain]] near Chattanooga, Tennessee, [[Sharp's Ridge]] in Knoxville, Tennessee, and Paris Mountain in [[Greenville, South Carolina]].

Other examples of co-located towers on mountain peaks in the United States are on Red Mountain in Birmingham, Alabama; [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]] near Los Angeles; the [[Sutro Tower]] in Clarendon Heights near [[Mount Sutro]] in San Francisco; [[Lookout Mountain, Colorado]] near Denver; Cedar Hill between Dallas and Fort Worth; [[South Mountain Park]] near Phoenix; Nelson Peak near Salt Lake City; [[Sandia Crest]] near Albuquerque, New Mexico. 

Probably the most famous broadcast antenna farm of all is the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] Tower One, on which many of the New York City television and several FM stations had their antennas. All were lost when Twin Towers One and Two collapsed after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. Most of those stations now broadcast from their previous home, 200 feet lower, on the Empire State Building.

==Objections==

Antenna farms have often been the source of complaints from local neighborhoods, particularly when a new tower is added.  This has been increasingly so for [[TV station]]s, which have been pursuing with alacrity the construction of new [[digital television]] antennas.  Because many of these towers are already full, or were built well before there was the expectation of DTV, many stations have been forced to go through the even greater expense of constructing a new tower.

One such situation was in [[Colorado]], in the late 1990s and early to mid-2000s.  Many of the [[Denver metropolitan area]] TV stations already transmitted analog TV from [[Lookout Mountain (Colorado)|Lookout Mountain]], but needed the extra space for more antennas.  Additionally, since many people live on Lookout Mountain, there was also the concern about safety, not only from falling ice or even the slight risk of a tower collapse, but also ongoing from the additional RF that it would create.  Residents and the city of [[Golden, Colorado|Golden]] filed legal objections, including challenging the authority of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to override denial of [[zoning]] permits by local government (in this case, the [[Jefferson County, Colorado|Jefferson]] [[county commission]]).  The city of Golden also sought to [[eminent domain|condemn]] the site, even though it was outside city limits.  It was decided that scenic [[Eldorado Mountain]] near [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] might be a better site, but there were also objections that it would ruin the view of that mountain from the valley.  Despite other alternatives, the new "supertower" was forced on Lookout Mountain by the [[U.S. Congress]], allowing the existing towers to be removed in 2009 after [[analog shutdown]].  The site began operating in spring 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media-visions.com/itv-denvertower1.html Media Visions Journal - Denver DTV 'Supertower'Faces Local Resistance by Ken Freed]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2004/04/12/story8.html Denver Business Journal - HDTV tower project delayed by Amy Bryer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[TV Technology]] - [http://tv-technology.com/article/19858 Denver Lookout Mountain TV Tower Finished by Doug Lung]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Broadcast Engineering]] - [http://broadcastengineering.com/RF/dielectric-lookout-mountain-dtv-0821 Dielectric completes Lookout Mountain DTV transmission project serving Denver] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012214629/http://broadcastengineering.com/RF/dielectric-lookout-mountain-dtv-0821 |date=October 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[TV Technology]] - [http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/65788 Denver Finally Gets its DTV by Ken Freed]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parygin boris dmitrievitch.jpg|thumb|alt="Photo of Russian scientist Boris Parygin."|'''Boris Parygin'''.]]

'''Boris Dmitrievitch Parygin''' (Russian: Борис Дмитриевич Парыгин) (19 June 1930 – 9 April 2012) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and Russian philosopher, sociologist and one of the founders of [[social psychology]] and member of a wide range of international academies. Parygin was a specialist in a sphere of philosophical and psychological problems of social psychology – its history, methodology, theory and [[praxeology]].

== Biography ==
Parygin was born in [[Leningrad]], [[USSR]], where he survived the [[Siege of Leningrad]]. After school he attended [[Saint Petersburg State University]] where he studied philosophy (1948—1953, diploma with distinction). In 1961 he defended a theses about a problem of the social mood. In 1967 defended a doctoral theses ''Social Psychology as a science (questions of history, methodology and theory)''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childpsy.ru/upload/dissertations/%CF%E0%F0%FB%E3%E8%ED_%C1_%C4_8_1967.htm Парыгин_Б_Д_8_1967&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
After graduation he was teaching philosophy at [[Saint Petersburg State Pediatric Medical Academy]] (1957–1962). In 1965, Saint Petersburg State University publishing house had released Parygin’s first monograph "Social Psychology as a Science", which became a bibliographical rarity. In 1967, a revised edition of the monograph (15,000 copies) was translated into Czech, Bulgarian and Spanish. 

From 1968 Parygin was at the head of the Philosophy Department of a [[Herzen University]]. There he created the laboratory of the social and psychologic studies and social psychology faculty which was the first one in the Soviet Union. Many first-rate scientists lectured there and books edited by Boris Parygin were published. 

In 1971, Parygin’s work titled ''The Basics of Socio-Psychological Theory'' was published (20,000 printed copies). In his book, Parygin presented the concept of the main social and psychological problems and first of all—the question of personality and human communication. This book drew a wide response in a scientific sphere of the Soviet Union and abroad. The monograph was republished in Germany (Cologne, 1975, Berlin, 1976) and in Japan (Tokyo, 1977).

At the meeting of [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (1972), however, Parygin was called a leader of international [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]] of [[Marxism]] because of his independent interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unlv.edu/centers/cdclv/archives/Interviews/parygin.html Parygin Interview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206173745/http://www.unlv.edu/centers/cdclv/archives/Interviews/parygin.html |date=6 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he was accused of the intention to substitute Marxist philosophy by the Philosophy of Personality. Due to this, he had got a different job in a Social and Economic Problems Institute, where he organized and led the department of socio-psychologic problems of the labor collectives. The results of his work have found reflection in his books ''The Scientific-Technical Revolution and personality'' (1978),&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/415493?lookfor=author:%22Parygin,%20Boris%20Dmitrievich%22&amp;offset=2&amp;max=2 NLA catalogue&lt;/ref&gt; “Social and psychological climate of the collective” (1981),&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Search/Home?lookfor=author:%22Parygin,%20B.%20D.%20%28Boris%20Dmitrievich%29,%201930-%22&amp;iknowwhatimean=1 National Library of Austria&lt;/ref&gt; ''Social psychology of  territorial self-government'' (1993) and others.
Parygin was the head of the Research Committee of a Social Association, coordinated international researches within a [[Comecon]].

== Publications ==

He was the author of 10 prominent monographs and more than 400 articles, which were translated into many foreign languages (English, French, German, Spanish, Chinese, Portuguese, Bulgarian, Czech, Hungarian, Lithuanian, Lettish and others).

Main publications:
* Socio-Psychological Climate of a Collective. 1981. (in Russian).
* Scientific and Technical Revolution and Personality. Moscow, 1978. – 249. p. (in Russian).
* The Basics of Socio-Psychological Theory. Moscow, 1971. – 352 p. (in Russian).

A major turning point for Braille literacy was the passage by the [[United States Congress]] of the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]], which moved thousands of children from specialized schools for the blind into mainstream public schools.&lt;ref name="Ranalli2008"/&gt; Because only a small percentage of public schools could afford to train and hire Braille-qualified teachers, Braille literacy has declined since the law took effect.&lt;ref name="Ranalli2008"/&gt; Braille literacy rates have improved slightly since the bill was passed, in part because of pressure from consumers and advocacy groups that have led 27 states to pass legislation mandating that children who are legally blind be given the opportunity to learn braille.&lt;ref name="Ruby Riles" /&gt;

In 1998-99 there were approximately 55,200 legally blind children in the United States, but only 5,500 of them used braille as their primary reading medium.&lt;ref name=Blind1999&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early Braille education is crucial to literacy for a visually impaired child. A study conducted in the state of Washington found that people who learned braille at an early age did just as well as, if not better than, their sighted peers in several areas, including vocabulary and comprehension.  In the preliminary adult study, while evaluating the correlation between adult literacy skills and employment, it was found that 44 percent of the participants who had learned to read in Braille were unemployed, compared to the 77 percent unemployment rate of those who had learned to read using print.&lt;ref name=Ph2004&gt;{{Citation

Currently, among the estimated 85,000 blind adults in the United States {{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2018}}, 90 percent of those who are braille literate are employed. Among adults who do not know Braille, only 1 in 3 is employed.&lt;ref name="Ranalli2008"/&gt; Statistically, history has proven that braille reading proficiency provides an essential skill set that allows visually impaired children not only to compete with their sighted peers in a school environment, but also later in life as they enter the workforce.&lt;ref name="Ruby Riles" /&gt;

===Braille Instruction at Hadley===

Hadley is the largest educator of braille as well as the largest worldwide provider of distance education for people who are blind or visually impaired. Braille literacy has been a priority for Hadley since its founding in 1920, and to this day, braille courses are still the most popular. During the 2010 fiscal year, Hadley enrolled nearly 3,400 students in braille reading and writing courses alone (combined sighted and blind students). Hadley currently offers 14 braille courses taught by 11 highly trained instructors. Nine courses are focused on tactile learners, and Hadley also provides five courses for sighted individuals, including families and professionals in the field.

Hadley School has advanced the use of braille in a number of ways over the years, including being one of the first institutions to use the Thermoform Duplicator, which copies braille from paper to a Brailon (a sheet of durable plastic) and one of the first to use a computer-driven, high-speed braille printer. A longtime leader in braille production, Hadley produces more than 50,000 braille pages each year, supplementing mass brailling done offsite. For a modest fee, Hadley provides braille transcription services in accordance with the [[Braille Authority of North America]]. Transcribers are certified by the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped.

=== NLS Braille Certification Program ===

The [[National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped]] (NLS) of the [[Library of Congress]] has contracted with the [[National Federation of the Blind]] (NFB) to offer a certificate of proficiency for braille transcribers and proofreaders who are interested in working in their communities to produce Braille materials for blind people. Certified Braille volunteers transcribe material into Braille that is used by state departments of special education, NLS, and libraries that distribute books and magazines through the NLS program. These volunteers complete a detailed course of Braille transcribing and provide essential materials in the advancement of Braille literacy.&lt;ref name=Service2006&gt;{{Citation

 | year = 2006 | author = Service, National Library
 | journal = NLS Factsheets
 | issue = May | accessdate = 2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NLS also offers a broad range of Braille literacy information and resources including braille books, software, and other material intended to assist with the production of braille. This information can be very helpful for family members, friends, and professionals who desire information about braille literacy. They provide educational resources for instructors who teach braille as well as those who are interested in learning to read and write Braille.

=== ReadBooks! Because Braille Matters ===

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20090510083746/http://www.nbp.org/ic/nbp/readbooks/index.html ReadBooks!] program from [http://www.nbp.org National Braille Press] distributes free braille literacy bags in the U.S. and Canada to families with blind children, birth to age 7. The program introduces blind children to braille at the earliest age and encourages families to read print/braille books together. Since the inception of the program in 2001, over 9,000 braille literacy bags have been distributed in English or Spanish.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20090510083746/http://www.nbp.org/ic/nbp/readbooks/index.html ReadBooks!] bags contain age-appropriate print-braille books; a primer for sighted parents to learn braille; tactile literacy objects/games; waxed string for drawing; and a guide for parents on why and how to read books with their young blind child. Print-braille books are standard print books, like ''Miss Nelson Is Missing'' or ''Corduroy'', with braille text added on transparent plastic sheets so everyone can read together. National Braille Press works with educators and early intervention professionals to identify families who could benefit from the book bags; [https://web.archive.org/web/20091001191130/http://www.nbp.org/ic/nbp/readbooks/request.html families can request their own bags]. There is increasing evidence that parental beliefs and attitudes about reading and the opportunities parents provide their children in reading can greatly influence children's reading development. Parents can help their children prepare by providing a braille-rich environment in the home.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justreadflorida.com/promote.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501005007/http://www.justreadflorida.com/promote.asp |archivedate=2009-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dots for Tots ===

The Dots for Tots program aims to engage and strengthen the senses of a visually impaired child.  This is important to get them prepared for reading and interested in literacy.&lt;ref name=Lamb1998&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The free program offers free books and kits to promote literacy among blind children of preschool and early elementary age. The dots in this program are very important and parallel with the literacy requirements of a sighted child learning their ABCs. It also helps grab a blind child's interest in the same way that a picture book encourages literacy for a sighted child.&lt;ref name=Witsenhausen2004&gt;{{Citation

The program equips schools and educators with the tools to ensure that children who are blind receive the same quality of education that their sighted peers do. It helps remove education barriers as well as ease the fears that many children have of facing school with a handicap.&lt;ref name=Whittaker1999&gt;{{Citation

This program provides visually impaired children with books that have been printed in Braille. Children are able to follow along with the rest of their classmates when reading popular children's books in libraries, at home, or in a school environment. Dots for Tots provide an entire book kit that includes the children's book in braille, a tape with a professional descriptive narration with sound effects, and a set of three-dimensional toys that allow them to understand the importance of visualizing stories with their fingers.&lt;ref name=America&gt;{{Citation

=== Connecting the Dots ===

The [[American Foundation for the Blind]] (AFB) offers the Connecting the Dots resource for parents to promote early Braille literacy. The program provides a folder containing fact sheets about braille, resource lists, and information for parents about braille, organizations that promote braille literacy, sources of braille books and magazines, adapted materials, and other information intended to promote literacy development.&lt;ref name=Blind&gt;{{Citation

=== Instant Access to Braille ===

The Instant Access to Braille program, supported through [[US Department of Education]] Office of [[Special Education]] Programs CFDA 84.00327A, provides blind and visually impaired students with access to learning materials in  braille to support braille literacy efforts in general education classrooms.  This program provides portable braille note-taking devices to students to train students as well as assist educators, parents, and school administrators overcome the barriers of teaching special needs children and ensuring that students receive the equivalent education opportunities that sighted children receive. The program also provides assistance with converting their printed learning materials into electronic format so that visually impaired students are not at disadvantaged in the school environment.

The Instant Access program is intended to assist students in grades 3-10 that use [[New York (state)|New York]] State curriculum and is focused on academics related mainly to [[Social Studies]]. There is no charge for the Braille note-taking devices, disk drives, printers or setup of the equipment. The program is a one-year school-based project and can be adjusted to take full advantage of features that will benefit the student and support the education process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[Image:lichfieldclose.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|[[Cathedral Close, Lichfield|Lichfield Cathedral Close]]]]
A '''cathedral close''' is the area immediately around a [[cathedral]], sometimes extending for a hundred metres or more from the main cathedral building. In Europe in the Middle Ages, and often later, it was usually all the property of the cathedral and under the bishop or cathedral's legal jurisdiction rather than that of the city. It normally had gates which were locked at night or when there were disturbances in the city, hence the name. It usually included buildings housing diocesan offices, schools, free-standing chapels associated with the cathedral, and the palace of the [[bishop]] and other [[clergy]] houses associated with the cathedral. They sometimes but not necessarily are arranged in a sort of square around a courtyard, as in the close at [[Salisbury Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/file/map-salisbury-cathedral-closejpg-3 map of the close at [[Salisbury Cathedral]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The German term is [[Domfreiheit]].

Today there are often residences of non-clerics, which may include official or prominent persons such as judges' houses. Until recent local government reforms many cathedral closes still functioned as separate administrative unit: [[St. David's]] cathedral close, in [[Pembrokeshire]], counted as a separate civil parish from that of the adjacent village-city for some 50 years after the [[disestablishment]] in Wales. Others still have the secularised former residences of canons but no resident senior clergy. In other cities, such as [[Trier]], property close to the cathedral is occupied by clergy.

==In literature==

The Barchester novels ([[Chronicles of Barsetshire]]) of [[Anthony Trollope]] are set largely in the cathedral close of the fictional town of Barchester.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3653">"'''Common prostitute'''" is a term used in [[English law]] related to [[prostitution]]. The term was first used in the [[Vagrancy Act 1824]]. The term continued to be used in the [[Street Offences Act 1959]] which maintained the illegality of street prostitution. Section 1 stated: "It shall be an offence for a common prostitute to loiter or solicit in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/legResults.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Street+Offences+Act+1959%2c&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;activeTextDocId=1127916&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;SortAlpha=0  Street Offences Act 1959]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was widely regarded as archaic, stigmatising, and offensive, and a number of failed attempts had been made since the 1920s to enact new legislation which would replace the wording with a solicitation law that applied to both sexes equally, and did not create an offence that could only be committed by a special class of person.
 
In 2007 the government announced that it would introduce new legislation which would eliminate the use of the term, and replace it with new language which would apply equally to males and females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Policing and Crime Act 2009 also introduced tough new measures aimed at men seeking women for the purpose of prostitution.  In particular the act makes it an offence for someone to pay or promise to pay a prostitute who has been subject to ‘exploitive conduct’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=Prostitution_loitering_paying_or_soliciting_a_prostitute_subjected_to_force Prostitution loitering paying or soliciting a prostitute subjected to force] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201101807/http://wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=Prostitution_loitering_paying_or_soliciting_a_prostitute_subjected_to_force |date=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The change made the customer an equal offender with the street prostitute.

'''Consumer culture theory''' is the study of [[consumption choice]]s and behaviors from a social and cultural point of view, as opposed to an [[Economics|economic]] or [[psychological]] one. It does not offer a grand unifying theory but "refers to a family of theoretical perspectives that address the dynamic relationships between consumer actions, the marketplace, and cultural meanings".&lt;ref name="CCT1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arnould|first1=E.

Consumer culture is viewed as "social arrangement in which the relations between lived culture and social resources, between meaningful ways of life and the symbolic and material resources on which they depend, are mediated through markets"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnould|first=E.

== Methodology ==
There is a widely held misperception by people outside CCT researchers that this field is oriented toward the study of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] contexts.&lt;ref name="CCT1" /&gt; Memorable study contexts, such as the [[Harley-Davidson]] subculture&lt;ref name="bikes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schouten|first1=J.|last2=McAlexander|first2=J. H.|year=1995|title=Subcultures of Consumption: An Ethnography of the New Bikers|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=22|issue=3|pages=43–.,./61|url=http://classes.bus.oregonstate.edu/winter-07/ba492/Subcultures%20of%20Consumption.pdf|doi=10.1086/209434}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Burning Man]] festival&lt;ref name="burning"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kozinets|first=Robert V|year=2002|title=Can Consumers Escape the Market?

While CCT is often associated with [[qualitative methodology|qualitative methodologies]], such as interviews, case studies, [[Ethnography|ethnographic]], as well as 'netnographic' methods&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Field Behind the Screen: Using Netnography for Marketing Research in Online Communities|url = http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.39.1.61.18935|journal = Journal of Marketing Research|date = February 1, 2002|issn = 0022-2437|pages = 61–72|volume = 39|issue = 1|doi = 10.1509/jmkr.39.1.61.18935|first = Robert V.|last = Kozinets}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are well adapted to study the experiential, sociological and cultural aspects of consumption, these are not a prerequisite to CCT contribution (Arnould &amp; Thompson 2005).

== Fields of study ==
Arnould &amp; Thompson&lt;ref name="CCT1" /&gt; identifies four research programs in CCT: 
*Consumer identity projects, such as Schau &amp; Gilly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schau|first1=H. J.|last2=Gilly|first2=M. C.|year=2003|title=We Are What We Post?

*Marketplace culture, such as Schouten &amp; McAlexander&lt;ref name="bikes" /&gt; study on the Harley-Davidson subculture, which looked at consumers as culture producers. This research program builds particularly on Maffesoli's concept of neo-tribes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Time of the Tribes: The Decline of Individualism in Mass Society|url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=36elPGofHRUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=maffesoli+tribes&amp;ots=hV24JGRbE9&amp;sig=oBtoxgJANeqzP2WzuijhDr6y-zY|publisher = SAGE|date = 1995-12-05|isbn = 9781848609532|first = Michel|last = Maffesoli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of consumer tribes have focused, for example, on clubbing culture and surf culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Learning to be tribal: facilitating the formation of consumer tribes|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/03090561311306886|journal = European Journal of Marketing|date = May 24, 2013|issn = 0309-0566|pages = 813–832|volume = 47|issue = 5/6|doi = 10.1108/03090561311306886}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Mass-mediated marketplace ideologies and consumers' interpretive strategies, such as Kozinets&lt;ref name="burning" /&gt; study of the Burning Man Festival, which looked at consumer ideologies and identities are influenced by economic and cultural globalisation and how cultural product systems orient consumers toward certain ideologies or identity projects.
*Sociohistoric patterning of consumption, such as Holt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holt|first=D.

'''Deep Green Resistance''' ('''DGR''') is a radical environmental movement that views mainstream [[Environmentalism|environmental activism]] as being largely ineffective.&lt;ref name=McBay&gt;McBay, Aric, Lierre Keith, and Derrick Jensen. 2011. ''Deep Green Resistance.'' New York: Seven Stories Press.&lt;/ref&gt; DGR is also used by group members to refer to their particular political strategies. The group believes that [[industrial civilization]], as they define it, is endangering all life on the planet and that a broad range of tactics are needed to achieve [[environmental justice|environmental]] and [[social justice]]. They argue for a radical shift in societal structures and functions.&lt;ref name=McBay/&gt;

==Beliefs==
In the book ''Deep Green Resistance'', the authors state that civilization, particularly [[industrialisation|industrial civilization]], is fundamentally unsustainable and must be actively (and urgently) dismantled in order to secure a livable future for all species on the planet.&lt;ref name=McBay/&gt; Civilization can be defined as the development of agriculture and the growth of cities. Deep Green Resistance argues that agriculture is detrimental to land fertility and cities necessarily surpass the natural carrying capacity of land bases. Civilization relies heavily on industry, which operates largely on non-renewable and unclean fossil fuels.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

DGR's principles stem from the concept of [[deep ecology]] and state that all species are inherently equal, and thus humans are not superior to any other form of life. Deep ecology attributes the current environmental crisis to the anthropocentrism that is embedded in Western perspectives. The term, first used by the Norwegian philosopher [[Arne Næss]], was quickly taken up by a variety of radical environmental groups, such as Earth First!.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, Merle. 1994. “Sustainable Development and Deep Ecology: An Analysis of Competing Traditions.” Environmental Management 18(4):477-488.&lt;/ref&gt; Deep ecology provides a foundation upon which to base the cross-cultural nature-based spirituality that is often associated with radical environmental movements.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Bron. 2001. “Earth and Nature-Based Spirituality (Part I): From Deep Ecology to Radical Environmentalism.” Religion 31:175-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement differentiates itself from [[bright green environmentalism]], which is characterized by a focus on personal, technological, or government and corporate solutions, in that it holds these solutions as inadequate. DGR believes that lifestyle changes, such as using travel mugs and reusable bags and taking shorter showers, are too small for the large-scale environmental problems the world faces. It also states that the recent surge in environmentalism has become commercial in nature, and thus in itself has been industrialized. The movement asserts that per capita industrial waste produced is orders of magnitude greater than personal waste produced; therefore, it is industrialism that must be ended, and with that, lifestyle changes will follow.&lt;ref name=McBay/&gt;

==Origins and advocates==
The term was created for a conference entitled "Deep Green Resistance. Confronting Industrial Culture" in April, 2007 in Deerfield, Massachusetts. [[Lierre Keith]] was the main organizer.

Deep Green theory draws on elements of [[anthropology]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[deep ecology]] and [[ecofeminism]].

[[Derrick Jensen]] is a prominent member of the Deep Green Resistance Advisory Board. In addition to being a radical activist, he is also a writer, philosopher and teacher. Lierre Keith, another board member, is a feminist activist, writer and small farmer. Stephanie McMillan, and [[Jack D. Forbes]] are also prominent influences on the movement. DGR draws on the philosophy and writings of many authors, including [[Arne Næss]], [[Richard Manning]], [[Andrea Dworkin]], Peggy Reeves Sanday, [[David Abram]], [[Chellis Glendinning]], [[Chris Hedges]], [[Joseph Tainter]], [[Richard Heinberg]], [[Daniel Quinn]], Tracie Marie Park (a.k.a. Zoe Blunt) and [[Jerry Mander]], among others.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Resistance tactics==
The Deep Green perspective argues that the dominant culture, a term that encompasses all the cultures within globalized civilization, will not undergo a voluntary transformation to a sustainable way of living. This includes the dismissal of a possible success of a slow and soft shift to [[sustainability]]. Members of the Deep Green movement believe that industrial civilization will inevitably collapse. This notion is based on historical examples of the collapse of major civilizations such as Rome or the Mayan civilization, and statistics regarding the current system's unsustainability. DGR maintains that humans must act decisively before the collapse to ensure the Earth that remains inhabitable for all organisms and that humans build a more sustainably structured society following the collapse.&lt;ref name=McBay/&gt; Deep Green Resistance supports an active resistance movement with the objective of accelerating the collapse of industrial civilization.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Within the Deep Green theory, lifestyle or personal changes are not considered effective methods of creating meaningful change. The mainstream environmental movement is seen as being distracted by its emphasis on individual lifestyle changes and technological solutions instead of confronting systems of power and holding individuals, industries, and institutions accountable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/articles/article/4801/ |title=Forget Shorter Showers |publisher=Orion Magazine |date= |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fertileground1.ning.com/page/a-context-for-fg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009210832/http://fertileground1.ning.com/page/a-context-for-fg |archivedate=October 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders of the Deep Green movement view technological solutions, no matter how well-intentioned, as unsatisfactory and warn that they could even lead to accelerated ecological destruction and pollution.&lt;ref name=McBay/&gt;

===Advocating for militant resistance===
Decisive Ecological Warfare:&lt;ref name=DGRDEW&gt;{{cite web|title=Decisive Ecological Warfare|url=http://deepgreenresistance.org/en/deep-green-resistance-strategy/decisive-ecological-warfare|website=deepgreenresistance.org|publisher=Deep Green Resistance|accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Well-organized underground militants would make coordinated attacks on energy infrastructure around the world … actions against pipelines, power lines, tankers, and refineries, perhaps using electromagnetic pulses. ….&lt;ref name=C&amp;C&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ian Angus|title='Deep Green Resistance' – How not to build a movement|url=http://climateandcapitalism.com/2012/05/10/deep-green-resistance-a-path-to-certain-defeat/|website=climateandcapitalism.com|publisher=Climate &amp; Capitalism|accessdate=February 9, 2015|format=Book review|date=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Proponents of Deep Green Resistance encourage strategies for [[social action]] that range from violent to non-violent. DGR's support for militant action (described as a potentially necessary means by which to invoke drastic environmental change) is rejected by many [[pacifist]]s. Some have called this a potential deterrent to environmentalists who believe in nonviolent activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/12/20/deep-green-resistance/ |title=Deep Green Resistance |website=Counterpunch.org |date=2011-12-20 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The strategy described by Jensen, McBay and Keith largely centers around hard-hitting infrastructural sabotage, such as forcible [[dam removal]], rather than any kind of personal violence.

Jensen predicts, regarding the movement, that acts of personal violence in the future will be almost completely offensive by those countering the resistance movement (i.e. those currently in power) and self-defensive by those enacting the resistance movement. When asked, "If we dismantle civilization, won't that kill millions of people in cities? What about them?," Jensen has responded that "No matter what you do, your hands will be blood red... because the global economy is [already] murdering humans and non-humans the planet over...." and "As this culture continues to collapse, those who are doing the exploiting will continue.... Don’t blame those who want to stop that exploitation. Instead, help to stop the exploitation that is killing people in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Millions Killed?|work=Deep Green Resistance|url=http://www.deepgreenresistance.org/faq/millionskilled/|accessdate=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen has also clarified such ideas on ''[[Democracy Now!]]'': "I get accused of being the 'violence guy'... but I don’t ever think that's really fair, because I really consider myself the 'everything guy', that I want to put everything on the table and talk about all forms of resistance.... We can certainly parse out cases where we think it's appropriate to have militant response or non-militant response."&lt;ref name = DN112610&gt;{{cite interview|last=Jensen|first=Derrick|interviewer=[[Amy Goodman]]|work=[[Democracy Now!]]|date=26 November 2010|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/11/26/author_and_activist_derrick_jensen|title=Author and Activist Derrick Jensen: "The Dominant Culture is Killing the Planet...It’s Very Important for Us to Start to Build a Culture of Resistance"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keith has discussed in depth the "complexity of the issue of violence" in the organization's [[eponymous]] book, and how it is "understandable that people who care about justice want to reject violence; many of us are survivors of it." However, she urges the following distinctions, favoring only the second in each dichotomy: "the violence of hierarchy vs. the violence of self-defense, violence against actual people vs. violence against property, and the [use of] violence as self-actualization vs. the violence of political resistance. It is difficult to find someone who is against all of these."&lt;ref name=McBay/&gt;

While Deep Green Resistance maintains that it is a strictly aboveground movement, Keith and McBay have openly encouraged an additional element of underground action, and DGR provides the theoretical and aboveground framework to support such action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deepgreenresistance.org|title=Deep Green Resistance Homepage|website=Deepgreenresistance.org|accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's book points to historical examples of resistance movements that relied on an interdependence between aboveground and underground networks in order to accomplish mutual goals.

==Literature and references==
A book titled ''Deep Green Resistance: Strategy to Save the Planet'' by Aric McBay, [[Lierre Keith]], and [[Derrick Jensen]] was released in May 2011, from Seven Stories Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Deep Green Resistance: Strategy to Save the Planet |author1=Derrick Jensen |author2=Aric McBay |author3=Lierre Keith |isbn=9781583229293 |website=Amazon.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is divided into four sections: Resistance, Organization, Strategy and Tactics, and the Future. Each section contains several essays written by McBay or Keith and concludes with Jensen's answers to common questions about resistance. The book intends to provide a framework from which readers can build upon in order to begin fighting for environmental change.&lt;ref name=McBay/&gt;

==Gender issues==
The organization's official website states that "DGR strives to be a radical organization in every respect, including our approach to feminist struggles."&lt;ref name=radfem&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.deepgreenresistance.org/faq-radical-feminism/ |title=FAQ: Radical Feminism |work=deepgreenresistance.org |year=2013 |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; DGR's [[radical feminism]] views [[gender role|gender]], by definition, as a social system created by [[patriarchy]] to coercively and violently control behavior of both males and females; however, within this system, men and masculinity are privileged, while women are trained into subordinated behavior and routinely targeted for institutionalized and socially sanctioned violence due to their sex and/or gender role.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

DGR's stance on gender has led some to interpret DGR as transphobic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://earthfirstnews.wordpress.com/2013/05/15/deep-green-transphobia/ |title=Deep Green Transphobia |work=earthfirstnews.wordpress.com |year=2013 |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy especially swelled when a newly [[Transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]] member of DGR, self-identifying as a woman, requested to join a women-only communal sleeping and showering space and, later, a women-only caucus space; the women's caucus discussed the issue collectively and ultimately denied the applicant.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} A year after this, Aric McBay claimed he "left the organization at the beginning of 2012 after a trans inclusive policy was cancelled by Derrick Jensen and Lierre Keith. Many good people and good activists left the organization for that reason. I find these transphobic attitudes to be disgusting and deeply troubling...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aricmcbay.org/2013/05/14/dgr-and-transphobia/ |title=DGR and Transphobia |first=Aric |last=McBay |work=aricmcbay.org |year=2013 |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://earthfirstjournal.org/newswire/2013/05/16/deep-green-reclamation/ |title=Deep Green Resignation and Reclamation &amp;#124; Earth First! Newswire |website=Earthfirstjournal.org |date= |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://conference.resistanceecology.org/ |title=Resistance Ecology Comes To An&amp;nbsp;End |website=Conference.resistanceecology.org |date= |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; DGR released a note in response to McBay's statement, claiming that McBay actually departed the organization by mutual agreement, after unsuccessfully trying to force Derrick Jensen and Lierre Keith from DGR. Keith and Jensen reiterated that the women of DGR made the decision to deny the applicant for themselves. In this statement, DGR also affirmed that "the right of women to define their own spaces" is central to how the organization operates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.deepgreenresistance.org/reponse-to-aric-mcbay/ |title=Reponse(sic) to Aric McBay |work=deepgreenresistance.org |year=2013 |quote=the right of women to define their own spaces |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization has denied these claims,&lt;ref name="deepgreenresistance.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.deepgreenresistance.org/protect-women-feminism-and-free-speech/ |title=Protect Women, Feminism, and Free Speech |work=deepgreenresistance.org |year=2013 |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; explaining that "DGR does not condone dehumanization or violence against anyone, including people who describe themselves as trans."&lt;ref name="deepgreenresistance.org" /&gt; The website asserts that DGR holds "a difference of opinion about the definition of gender" with [[genderism|genderists]], and states that "genderists think gender is an identity, an internal set of feelings people might have. Radical feminists think gender is a caste system."&lt;ref name="deepgreenresistance.org"/&gt; DGR's view of gender as a caste system implies that gender is an institution that cannot be improved or remedied, but, rather, requires complete dismantling so that egalitarian, spontaneous, and free behavior can emerge.&lt;ref name="radfem"/&gt; Because DGR inherently defines gender as "a brutal and corrupt arrangement of power," they want to dismantle the gender system, rather than reform it, celebrate it, or make it more inclusive. DGR, as self-described radical feminists, are "critical of gender itself. We are not gender reformists—we are gender abolitionists."&lt;ref name=radfem/&gt;

==Criticism==
{{See also|Deep ecology#Misconceptions|Anarcho-primitivism#Criticism}}
Critics of Deep Green Resistance have made claims similar to critics of [[anarcho-primitivism]] and [[deep ecology]]. DGR's ideas have been variously criticized by online publications as polarizing solutions to environmental reform, "elitist", "too radical", or "out of step."&lt;ref name="climateandcapitalism.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted on May 10, 2012 |url=http://climateandcapitalism.com/2012/05/10/deep-green-resistance-a-path-to-certain-defeat/ |title='Deep Green Resistance' - A path to certain defeat |website=Climateandcapitalism.com |date=2012-05-10 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founder Derrick Jensen, for example, has concluded in his earlier work ''Endgame'' that "The mass of civilized people will never be on our side.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LGL8PCVc_pcC&amp;pg=PT173&amp;lpg=PT173&amp;dq=%22The+mass+of+civilized+people+will+never+be+on+our+side%22+jensen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=crnwS2f7R7&amp;sig=Pg8F6ze5TXizSQ23qnKw3wpSaFg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yxCNUdzXOIi5rgH89YDgAw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ |title=The Derrick Jensen Reader: Writings on Environmental Revolution |author=Derrick Jensen |website=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the criticism of organizing a strategy that is pessimistic about popular involvement, and therefore aims at forcing change without the majority's consensus. Some critics have, therefore, argued that "radical tactics tend to be counterproductive to the goal of increasing awareness and concern in the general public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor |first=Bron |url=http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/elist/eListRead/resistance_do_the_ends_justify_the_means |title=Resistance: Do the Ends Justify the Means? &amp;#124; Latest News &amp;#124; Earth Island Journal &amp;#124; Earth Island Institute |website=Earthisland.org |date=2013-04-26 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of Deep Green Resistance further claim that DGR, which predicts massive numbers of human deaths during the forthcoming "crash" of civilization, does not offer a feasible or desirable alternative human lifestyle in seeking to accelerate this crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therightplanet.com/2012/01/deep-green-resistance-occupy-until-it-all-falls-apart/ |title=Deep Green Resistance: Occupy Until It All Falls Apart |website=Therightplanet.com |date=2012-01-02 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith and Jensen have both acknowledged this unpleasant reality; however, they have repeatedly claimed that the crash is inevitable (and will only result in more suffering the longer it is delayed) and that they are merely warning of—and trying to prepare the world for—these forthcoming deaths and possible wide-scale violence. Jensen has stated that if activists do not wish to participate in the physical work of accelerating this crash, they, at the very least, should locally prepare and "set up committees to eliminate or, if appropriate, channel the (additional) violence that might break out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It's Time to Get Out|author=Jensen, Derrick|work=Endgame|url=http://www.endgamethebook.org/Excerpts/18-Time-Get-Out.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchists who believe that all hierarchically structured relations, whatever the purpose, are oppressive, disagree with DGR's promotion of the use of hierarchical organization within any underground.&lt;ref name="EF Critique"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/AnarchyRadio03-08-2011/ |title=Anarchy Radio 03-08-2011 : John Zerzan : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |website=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; McBay and Keith have both promoted the idea of underground networks organized along hierarchical lines. Keith has advocated for a disciplined "command structure" regarding frontline activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Deep Green Resistance - Strategy to Save the Planet|publisher=YouTube|date=12 August 2011|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZxBg1CbmG8}}&lt;/ref&gt; McBay, in ''Deep Green Resistance'', has argued that hierarchies are an efficient means of organizing underground resistance.&lt;ref name="sproutdistro1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sproutdistro.com/2013/05/18/deep-green-resistance-a-book-review/ |title=Deep Green Resistance: A Book Review |publisher=Sprout Distro |date=2013-05-18 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchist writers—among them anarcho-primitivists like [[John Zerzan]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[Kevin Tucker (anarchist)|Kevin Tucker]]—have criticized DGR's Code of Conduct, their historical understanding of revolution and radical history, and the perceived "cult of personality" around Jensen and Keith.&lt;ref name="EF Critique"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthfirstjournal.org/newswire/articles/deep-green-resistance-a-critique|title=Deep Green Resistance — a critique|first1=Michelle| last1=Matisons|first2=Alexander Reid|last2=Ross|publisher=[[Earth First!]] Journal|year=2014–2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthspiritandanarchy.blogspot.com/2011/09/down-graded-resistance-critique-of-dgr.html/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218172433/http://earthspiritandanarchy.blogspot.com/2011/09/down-graded-resistance-critique-of-dgr.html |archivedate=December 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anarchistnews.org/node/14669/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103175958/http://anarchistnews.org/node/14669 |archivedate=November 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enkidu.anarchyplanet.org/2011/06/10/authority-and-civilization/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710101150/http://enkidu.anarchyplanet.org/2011/06/10/authority-and-civilization/ |archivedate=July 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sproutdistro1"/&gt;

'''Degranulation''' is a cellular process that releases [[antimicrobial]] [[cytotoxic]] or other molecules from [[secretion|secretory]] [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s called [[Granule (cell biology)|granules]] found inside some cells.   It is used by several different cells involved in the [[immune system]], including [[granulocytes]] ([[neutrophil]]s, [[basophil]]s, and [[eosinophil]]s) and [[mast cell]]s. It is also used by certain [[lymphocyte]]s such as [[natural killer cell|natural killer (NK) cells]] and [[cytotoxic T cell]]s, whose main purpose is to destroy invading microorganisms.

==Mast cells==
[[Antigens]] interact with [[IgE]] molecules already bound to high affinity [[Fc receptor]]s on the surface of [[mast cell]]s to induce degranulation, via the activation of tyrosine kinases within the cell. The mast cell releases a mixture of compounds, including [[histamine]], [[proteoglycan]]s, serotonin, and [[serine protease]]s from its cytoplasmic granules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamasaki S, Saito T |title=Regulation of mast cell activation through FcepsilonRI |journal=Chem Immunol Allergy |volume=87 |issue= |pages=22–31 |year= 2005|pmid=16107760 |doi=10.1159/000087568 |series=Chemical Immunology and Allergy |isbn=3-8055-7948-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eosinophils==
In a similar mechanism, activated eosinophils release preformed mediators such as [[major basic protein]], and [[enzyme]]s such as [[peroxidase]], following interaction between their Fc receptors and IgE molecules that are bound to large [[parasite]]s like [[helminth]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=David J, Butterworth A, Vadas M |title=Mechanism of the interaction mediating killing of Schistosoma mansoni by human eosinophils |journal=Am J Trop Med Hyg |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=842–8 |year=1980 |pmid=7435788}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Capron M, Soussi Gounni A, Morita M, Truong M, Prin L, Kinet J, Capron A |title=Eosinophils: from low- to high-affinity immunoglobulin E receptors |journal=Allergy |volume=50 |issue=25 Suppl |pages=20–23 |year=1995 |pmid=7677229 |doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.1995.tb04270.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neutrophils==
Four kinds of granules exist in neutrophils that display differences in content and regulation. Secretory vesicles are the most likely to release their contents by degranulation, followed by [[gelatinase]] granules, [[specific granule]]s, and [[azurophil]] granules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Faurschou M, Borregaard N |title=Neutrophil granules and secretory vesicles in inflammation |journal=Microbes Infect |volume=5 |issue=14 |pages=1317–1327 |year=2003 |pmid=14613775 |doi=10.1016/j.micinf.2003.09.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cytotoxic T cells and NK cells==
Cytotoxic T cells and NK cells release  molecules like [[perforin]] and [[granzyme]]s by
a process of directed [[exocytosis]] to kill infected target cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Veugelers K, Motyka B, Frantz C, Shostak I, Sawchuk T, Bleackley R |title=The granzyme B-serglycin complex from cytotoxic granules requires dynamin for endocytosis |journal=Blood |volume=103 |issue=10 |pages=3845–3853 |year=2004 |pmid=14739229 |doi=10.1182/blood-2003-06-2156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI)''' also called Decentralized Artificial Intelligence&lt;ref&gt;Demazeau, Yves, and J-P. Müller, eds. Decentralized Ai. Vol. 2. Elsevier, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; is a subfield of [[artificial intelligence]] research dedicated to the development of distributed solutions for problems. DAI is closely related to and a predecessor of the field of [[Multi-agent system|Multi-Agent Systems]].

==Definition==
Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) is an approach to solving complex learning, [[automated planning|planning]], and decision making problems. It is [[embarrassingly parallel]], thus able to exploit large scale computation and spatial distribution of computing resources. These properties allow it to solve problems that require the processing of very large data sets. DAI systems consist of autonomous learning processing nodes ([[Intelligent agent|agents]]), that are distributed, often at a very large scale. DAI nodes can act independently and partial solutions are integrated by communication between nodes, often asynchronously. By virtue of their scale, DAI systems are robust and elastic, and by necessity, loosely coupled. Furthermore, DAI systems are built to be adaptive to changes in the problem definition or underlying data sets due to the scale and difficulty in redeployment.

DAI systems do not require all the relevant data to be aggregated in a single location, in contrast to monolithic or centralized Artificial Intelligence systems which have tightly coupled and geographically close processing nodes. Therefore, DAI systems often operate on sub-samples or hashed impressions of very large datasets. In addition, the source dataset may change or be updated during the course of the execution of a DAI system.

==Goals==
The objectives of Distributed Artificial Intelligence are to solve the [[automated reasoning|reasoning]], planning, learning and perception problems of [[Artificial intelligence|Artificial Intelligence]], especially if they require large data, by distributing the problem to autonomous processing nodes (agents). To reach the objective, DAI requires:
* A [[Distributed computing|distributed system]] with robust and elastic computation on unreliable and failing resources that are loosely coupled
* Coordination of the actions and communication of the nodes
* Subsamples of large data sets and [[online machine learning]]

There are many reasons for wanting to distribute intelligence or cope with multi-agent systems. Mainstream problems in DAI research include the following:
* Parallel problem solving: mainly deals with how classic artificial intelligence concepts can be modified, so that [[multiprocessor]] systems and clusters of computers can be used to speed up calculation.
* Distributed problem solving (DPS): the concept of [[Intelligent agent|agent]], autonomous entities that can communicate with each other, was developed to serve as an [[abstraction]] for developing DPS systems. See below for further details.
* Multi-Agent Based Simulation (MABS): a branch of DAI that builds the foundation for simulations that need to analyze not only phenomena at [[macroscopic|macro]] level but also at [[microscopic scale|micro]] level, as it is in many [[social simulation]] scenarios.

==History==
In the 1975 distributed artificial intelligence emerged as a subfield of artificial intelligence that dealt with interaction of intelligent agents[2]. Distributed artificial intelligence systems were conceived as a group of intelligent entities, called agents, that interacted by cooperation, by coexistence or by competition. DAI is categorized into Multi-agent systems and distributed problem solving [1]. In [[Multi-agent system]]s the main focus is how agents coordinate their knowledge and activities. For distributed problem solving the major focus is how the problem is decomposed and the solutions are synthesized.

==Examples==
Multi-agent systems and distributed problem solving are the two main DAI approaches. There are numerous applications and tools.

==Approaches==
Two types of DAI has emerged: 
* In [[Multi-agent system]]s agents coordinate their knowledge and activities and reason about the processes of coordination. Agents are physical or virtual entities that can act, perceive its environment and communicate with other agents. The agent is autonomous and has skills to achieve goals. The agents change the state of their environment by their actions. There are a number of different coordination techniques[3].
* In distributed problem solving the work is divided among nodes and the knowledge is shared. The main concerns are task decomposition and synthesis of the knowledge and solutions.

DAI can apply a bottom-up approach to AI, similar to the [[subsumption architecture]] as well as the traditional top-down
approach of AI. In addition, DAI can also be a vehicle for [[emergence]].

==Applications==
Areas where DAI have been applied are:
* Electronic commerce, e.g. for [[Trading strategy|trading strategies]] the DAI system learns financial trading rules from subsamples of very large samples of financial data
* Networks, e.g. in [[telecommunication]]s the DAI system controls the cooperative resources in a WLAN network http://dair.uncc.edu/projects/past-projects/wlan-resource
* [[Scheduling (production processes)|Routing]], e.g. model vehicle flow in transport networks
* [[Scheduling (production processes)|Scheduling]], e.g. [[flow shop scheduling]] where the resource management entity ensures local optimization and cooperation for global and local consistency
* Multi-Agent systems, e.g. [[Artificial life|Artificial Life]], the study of simulated life 
* Electric power systems, e.g. COndition Monitoring Multi-Agent System (COMMAS) applied to transformer condition monitoring, and IntelliTEAM II Automatic Restoration System &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catterson|first=Victoria M.|last2=Davidson|first2=Euan M.|last3=McArthur|first3=Stephen D. J.|date=2012-03-01|title=Practical applications of multi-agent systems in electric power systems|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/etep.619/abstract|journal=European Transactions on Electrical Power|language=en|volume=22|issue=2|pages=235–252|doi=10.1002/etep.619|issn=1546-3109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
* [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/EVO-DesignOpt/groupWebSite/index.php?n=Site.BP#ECStar-fig ECStar], a distributed rule-based learning system

==Agents and Multi-agent systems==
Notion of Agents: Agents can be described as distinct entities with standard boundaries and interfaces designed for problem solving.

Notion of Multi-Agents:Multi-Agent system is defined as a network of agents which are loosely coupled working as a single entity like society for problem solving that an individual agent cannot solve.

==Software agents==
The key concept used in DPS and MABS is the abstraction called [[software agent]]s. An agent is a virtual (or physical) [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] entity that has an understanding of its environment and acts upon it. An agent is usually able to communicate with other agents in the same system to achieve a common goal, that one agent alone could not achieve. This communication system uses an [[agent communication language]].

A first classification that is useful is to divide agents into:
* reactive agent – A reactive agent is not much more than an automaton that receives input, processes it and produces an output.
* deliberative agent – A [[deliberative agent]] in contrast should have an internal view of its environment and is able to follow its own plans.
* hybrid agent – A hybrid agent is a mixture of reactive and deliberative, that follows its own plans, but also sometimes directly reacts to external events without deliberation.

Well-recognized agent architectures that describe how an agent is internally structured are:
* [[ASMO (cognitive architecture)|ASMO]] (emergence of distributed modules)
* [[BDI software agent|BDI]] (Believe Desire Intention, a general architecture that describes how plans are made)
* [[InterRAP]] (A three-layer architecture, with a reactive, a deliberative and a social layer)
* PECS (Physics, Emotion, Cognition, Social, describes how those four parts influences the agents behavior).
* [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]] (a rule-based approach)

== Challenges==
The challenges in Distributed AI are:

1.How to carry out communication and interaction of agents and which communication language or protocols should be used.

2.How to ensure the coherency of agents.

3.How to synthesise the results among 'intelligent agents' group by formulation, description, decomposition and allocation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2684">The '''Dundee Society''' was a society of graduates of CA-400, a [[National Security Agency]] course in [[cryptology]] devised by [[Lambros D. Callimahos]], which included the [[Zendian Problem]] (a practical exercise in [[traffic analysis]] and [[cryptanalysis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Callimahos, Lambros D. | title=Traffic Analysis and the Zendian Problem |publisher=Aegean Park Press | isbn=0-89412-161-8 | year=1989 | location=Walnut Creek, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The class was held once a year, and new members were inducted into the Society upon completion of the class.  The Society was founded in the mid-1950s and continued on after Callimahos' retirement from NSA in 1976.  The last CA-400 class was held at NSA in 1979, formally closing the society's membership rolls.&lt;ref name="DundeeSociety"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/crypto_almanac_50th/Lambros_D._Callimahos_Part_2_djpaul.pdf|title=Cryptologic Almanac 50th Anniversary Series, Lambros D.

The society took its name from an empty jar of [[Dundee Marmalade]] that Callimahos kept on his desk for use as a pencil caddy.  Callimahos came up with the society's name while trying to schedule a luncheon for former CA-400 students at the [[Fort George G. Meade|Ft. Meade]] Officers' Club; being unable to use either the course name or the [[No such agency|underlying government agency's name]] for security reasons, he spotted the ceramic Dundee jar and decided to use "The Dundee Society" as the cover name for the luncheon reservation.&lt;ref name="DundeeSociety" /&gt;  CA-400 students were presented with ceramic [[Marmalade#Dundee Marmalade|Dundee Marmalade]] jars at the close of the course as part of the induction ceremony into the Dundee Society. When Dundee switched from ceramic to glass jars, Callimahos would still present graduates with ceramic Dundee jars, but the jars were then collected back up for use in next year's induction ceremony, and members were "encouraged" to seek out Dundee jars for their own collections if they wished to have a permanent token of induction.&lt;ref name="DundeeSociety" /&gt;

This demonstrates the crustal spatial evolution at the Earth's surface dictated by plate tectonics. |248x248px]]
'''Crustal evolution''' involves the formation, destruction and renewal of the rocky outer shell at the [[Earth]]'s surface.

The variation in composition within the Earth's crust is much greater than other [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial planets]]. [[Mars]], [[Venus]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and other planetary bodies have relatively quasi-uniform crusts unlike that of the Earth which contains both oceanic and continental plates.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Albarède|first=Francis|last2=Blichert-Toft|first2=Janne|date=2007-12-19|title=The split fate of the early Earth, Mars, Venus, and Moon|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228642761|journal=Geochemistry (Cosmochemistry)|volume=339|issue=14–15|pages=917–927|doi=10.1016/j.crte.2007.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unique property reflects the complex series of crustal processes that have taken place throughout the planet's history, including the ongoing process of [[plate tectonics]].

The proposed mechanisms, regarding Earth's crustal evolution, take a theory-orientated approach. Fragmentary geologic evidence and observations provide the basis for hypothetical solutions to problems relating to the early Earth system. Therefore a combination of these theories creates both a framework of current understanding and also a platform for future study.

== Early crust ==

=== Mechanisms of early crust formation ===
The early Earth was entirely molten. This was due to high temperatures created and maintained by the following processes:

* Compression of the early atmosphere
* Rapid axial rotation
* Regular impacts with neighbouring planetesimals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EIrwxgpc9GsC|title=Historical Geology: Understanding Our Planet's Past|last=Erickson|first=Jon|date=2014-05-14|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438109640|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] remained hotter than modern day temperatures throughout the [[Archean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-07-01|title=A great thermal divergence in the mantle beginning 2.5 Ga: Geochemical constraints from greenstone basalts and komatiites|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987116000311|journal=Geoscience Frontiers|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=543–553|doi=10.1016/j.gsf.2016.01.006|issn=1674-9871|last1=Condie|first1=Kent C.|last2=Aster|first2=Richard C.|last3=Van Hunen|first3=Jeroen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the Earth began to cool as [[planetary accretion]] slowed and heat stored within the [[magma ocean]] was lost to space through [[radiation]].

A theory for the initiation of magma solidification states that once cool enough, the cooler base of the magma ocean would begin to crystallise first. This is because pressure of 25GPa at the surface cause the [[Solidus (chemistry)|solidus]] to lower.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2004-09-15|title=Early Earth differentiation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X04004285|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|language=en|volume=225|issue=3–4|pages=253–269|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2004.07.008|issn=0012-821X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of a thin 'chill-crust' at the extreme surface would provide thermal insulation to the shallow sub surface, keeping it warm enough to maintain the mechanism of crystallisation from the deep magma ocean.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;[[File:Phasediagram.png|thumb|310x310px|A phase diagram showing the order of crystallisation within the early mantle to form the early crust. 

An [[Adiabatic process|adiabat]] represents a change of temperature with pressure if no heat was lost through convection.

The early mantle adiabats show crystallisation took place from from the base; above approximately 25GPa (deep mantle) perovskites would begin to crystallise, below 25GPa (upper mantle) olivine would crystallise.]]

The composition of the crystals produced during the crystallisation of the magma ocean varied with depth. Experiments involving the melting of [[peridotite]] magma show that deep in the ocean (&gt;≈700m), the main mineral present would be Mg-[[perovskite]]. Whereas [[olivine]] would dominate in the shallower areas along with its high pressure [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s e.g. [[garnet]] and [[majorite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2004-06-15|title=Melting experiments of mantle materials under lower mantle conditions with implications for magma ocean differentiation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031920104000718|journal=Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors|language=en|volume=143-144|pages=397–406|doi=10.1016/j.pepi.2003.09.016|issn=0031-9201|last1=Ito|first1=E.|last2=Kubo|first2=A.|last3=Katsura|first3=T.|last4=Walter|first4=M.J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contributing theory to the formation of the first continental crust is through intrusive [[pluton]]ic volcanism. The product of these eruptions formed a hot, thick lithosphere which underwent regular cycling with the mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-12-01|title=Generation of felsic crust in the Archean: A geodynamic modeling perspective|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030192681500337X|journal=Precambrian Research|language=en|volume=271|pages=198–224|doi=10.1016/j.precamres.2015.10.005|issn=0301-9268|last1=Sizova|first1=E.|last2=Gerya|first2=T.|last3=Stüwe|first3=K.|last4=Brown|first4=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heat released by this form of volcanism, as well as assisting [[mantle convection]], increased the geothermal gradient of the early crust.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-10-01|title=Early Earth plume-lid tectonics: A high-resolution 3D numerical modelling approach|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264370716300503|journal=Journal of Geodynamics|language=en|volume=100|pages=198–214|doi=10.1016/j.jog.2016.03.004|issn=0264-3707|last1=Fischer|first1=R.|last2=Gerya|first2=T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crustal dichotomy ==
Crustal dichotomy represents the distinct contrast in composition and nature of the oceanic and continental plates, which together form the overall crust.

=== Timing ===
Oceanic and continental crusts are, at the present day, produced and maintained through plate tectonic processes. However the same mechanisms are unlikely to have produced the crustal [[dichotomy]] of the early lithosphere. This is thought to be true on the basis that sections of the thin, low density continental lithosphere could not have been sub-ducted under each other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Subsequently, a proposed relative timing for crustal dichotomy is put forward stating that dichotomy took place before the commencement of global plate tectonics. This is so a difference in crustal density could be established to facilitate plate subduction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1980-02-01|title=Crustal evolution of the early earth: The role of major impacts|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0301926880900121|journal=Precambrian Research|language=en|volume=10|issue=3–4|pages=195–216|doi=10.1016/0301-9268(80)90012-1|issn=0301-9268|last1=Frey|first1=Herbert|hdl=2060/19790015389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation ===
[[File:Complex Impact Crater Formation.png|thumb|Development of a the base of an impact crater on the Earth's surface showing infill of basaltic partial melts from mantle. This solidified to form the early differentiated oceanic crust.|317x317px]]
==== Impact cratering ====
Large and numerous impact craters can be recognised on planetary bodies across the Solar System. These craters are thought to date back to a period where there was an increased frequency and intensity of asteroid impacts with terrestrial planets, known as the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]], which terminated approximately 4Ga.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/collections/pjfmznbgbx|title=Bombardment of the early Solar System : Nature Geoscience|website=www.nature.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal goes on, claiming the Earth would have also sustained the same relative intensity of cratering as other planetesimals in the [[Solar System]]. It is therefore only due to Earth's high erosional rates and constant plate tectonics that the craters are not visible today. By scaling up the number and size of impact craters seen on the Moon to fit the size of Earth, it is predicted that at least 50% of the Earth's initial crust was covered in impact basins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This estimate provides a lower limit of the effect impact cratering had on the Earth's surface. 

======&lt;small&gt;Effects&lt;/small&gt;======
The main effects of impact cratering on the early lithosphere were:

* Formation of large craters. [[Isostasy|Isostatic rebound]] would adjust the depth of the craters making them relatively shallow in comparison to their diameter;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1977-10-01|title=Origin of the Earth's ocean basins|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103577900641|journal=Icarus|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=235–250|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(77)90064-1|issn=0019-1035|last1=Frey|first1=Herbert}}&lt;/ref&gt; some reaching 4&amp;nbsp;km deep and 1000&amp;nbsp;km in diameter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
*[[Topography|Topographic]] division between the low-lying impact basins and the now elevated surface.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
* Release in pressure at the surface from the removal of [[overburden]]. This produced a greater increase in temperature with depth below the surface. Increased surface temperatures caused the [[partial melting]] of mantle which erupted and deposited within the surface basins. The [[pyrolite]] mantle would have produced [[basalt]]ic partial melts, compositionally contrasting to the existing [[sial]]ic crust.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The magnitude of these impacts is interpreted, with a high level of uncertainty, to have converted roughly half of the 'continental' crust into terrestrial [[Lunar mare|maria]].&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Stuart Ross|date=1989-04-20|title=Growth of planetary crusts|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040195189901510|journal=Tectonophysics|language=en|volume=161|issue=3–4|pages=147–156|doi=10.1016/0040-1951(89)90151-0|issn=0040-1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore providing a method for the formation of crustal dichotomy, as seen today.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Types of crust ==

==== Primordial crust ====
The initial crystallisation of minerals from the [[magma ocean]] formed the primordial crust. 

A potential explanation of this process states the resultant solidification of the mantle edge took place approximately 4.43Ga. This would subsequently produce continents composed of [[komatiite]], an ultramafic rock rich in [[magnesium]] with a high melting point and low [[dynamic viscosity]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nna-Mvondo|first=Delphine|last2=Martinez-Frias|first2=Jesus|date=2007-02-15|title=Review komatiites: from Earth's geological settings to planetary and astrobiological contexts|journal=Earth, Moon, and Planets|language=en|volume=100|issue=3–4|pages=157–179|doi=10.1007/s11038-007-9135-9|issn=0167-9295|hdl=10261/8082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another line of research follows up on this, proposing that differences in the densities of newly formed crystals caused separation of crustal rocks; upper crust largely composed of fractionated [[gabbro]]s and lower crust composed of [[anorthosite]]s.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Santosh|first1=M.|last2=Arai|first2=T.|last3=Maruyama|first3=S.|date=2017-03-01|title=Hadean Earth and primordial continents: The cradle of prebiotic life|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987116300834|journal=Geoscience Frontiers|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=309–327|doi=10.1016/j.gsf.2016.07.005|issn=1674-9871}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall result of initial crystallisation formed a primordial crust roughly 60&amp;nbsp;km in depth.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The lack of certainty regarding the formation of primordial crust is due to there being no remaining present day examples. This is due to Earth's high erosional rates and the [[subduction]] and subsequent destruction of tectonic plates throughout its 4.5 Ga history.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Furthermore, during its existence the primordial crust is thought to have been regularly broken and re-formed by impacts involving other planetesimals.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This continued for several hundred million years after [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]], which concluded approximately 4.4Ga.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The outcome of this would be the constant alteration in the composition of the primordial crust, increasing the difficulty in determining its nature.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

==== Secondary crust ====
Recycling of existing primordial crust contributes to the production of secondary crust. Partial melting of the existing crust increases the [[mafic]] content of the melt producing basaltic secondary crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=L8OM3NDrttsC&amp;pg=PA484&amp;lpg=PA484&amp;dq=secondary+crust#v=onepage&amp;q=secondary%20crust&amp;f=false|title=Earth as an Evolving Planetary System|last=Condie|first=Kent C.|date=2011-08-25|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780123852274|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further method of formation due to the decay of [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] elements within the Earth releasing heat energy and eventually causing the partial melting of upper mantle, also producing basaltic lavas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RtC-nQEACAAJ|title=The Continental Crust: Its Composition and Evolution|last=Taylor|first=Stuart Ross|date=1985|publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, most secondary crust on Earth is formed at [[Mid-ocean ridge|mid ocean ridges]] forming the oceanic crust.

==== Tertiary crust ====
The present day continental crust is an example of a tertiary crust. Tertiary crust is the most differentiated type of crust and so has a composition vastly different to that of the bulk Earth.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S. R.|last2=McLennan|first2=S. M.|date=1985-01-01|title=The continental crust: Its composition and evolution|language=English|osti=6582885}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tertiary crust contains over 20% of the abundance of [[incompatible element]]s, which are elements a size or charge that prevent them from being included in mineral structure.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This a result of its generation from the subduction and partial melting of secondary crust where it undergoes further [[Fractional crystallization (geology)|fractional crystallisation]]. Two stages of evolution produce an increased proportion of incompatible elements.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Initiation of plate tectonics ==
[[File:Plumeinducedsubduction.png|thumb|357x357px|A schematic evolutionary diagram showing the impact of a mantle plume on the early lithosphere (dark blue) and surface proto-crust (brown). This initiated subduction and subsequent global plate tectonics within a previously unseparated lithosphere that had no lateral surface movement.Modified from &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2008-12-01|title=Subduction initiation by thermal–chemical plumes: Numerical studies|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031920108001581|journal=Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors|language=en|volume=171|issue=1-4|pages=296–312|doi=10.1016/j.pepi.2008.06.032|issn=0031-9201}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Localised areas of hot mantle rose to the surface through a central plume wedge, weakening the damaged and already thin lithosphere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Once the plume head breaks the surface, crust either side of the head is forced downwards through the conservation of mass, initiating subduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-01-01|title=Late Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1342937X14002391|journal=Gondwana Research|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=38–63|doi=10.1016/j.gr.2014.07.011|issn=1342-937X|last1=Whattam|first1=Scott A.|last2=Stern|first2=Robert J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerical modelling shows only strongly energetic plumes are capable of weakening the lithosphere enough to rupture it, such plumes would have been present in the hot Archean mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerya|first=T.

Pre-tectonic subduction can also be inferred from the internal volcanism on Venus. [[Artemis Corona]] is a large plume formed by the upwelling of mantle derived magma and is on a scale potentially comparable to that in the [[Archean]] mantle.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Models using its known characteristics showed that continued magmatism from [[Thermal conduction|conductive]] heat through the plume caused gravitational collapse. The weight of collapse caused the spreading of the surrounding crust outwards and subsequent subduction around the margins.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Kranendonk|first=Martin J|date=2010|title=Two types of Archean continental crust: Plume and plate tectonics on early Earth|url=http://www.ajsonline.org/content/310/10/1187.full.pdf+html|journal=American Journal of Science|volume=310|pages=1187–1209|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[anhydrous]] nature of the crust on Venus prevents it from sliding past each other, whereas through the study of oxygen isotopes, the presence of water on Earth can be confirmed from 4.3Ga.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-07-15|title=Magmatic δ18O in 4400–3900 Ma detrital zircons: A record of the alteration and recycling of crust in the Early Archean|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X05002773|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|language=en|volume=235|issue=3–4|pages=663–681|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2005.04.028|issn=0012-821X|last1=Cavosie|first1=A.J.|last2=Valley|first2=J.W.|last3=Wilde|first3=S.A.|last4=e.i.m.f}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this model helps provide a mechanism for how plate tectonics could have been triggered on Earth, although it does not demonstrate that subduction was initiated at the earliest confirmed presence of water on Earth. Based on these models, the onset of subduction and plate tectonics is dated at 3.6Ga.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Late Heavy Bombardment ===
Impact cratering also had consequences for both the development of plume-induced subduction and the establishment of global plate tectonics.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The steepening of geothermal gradients could have directly enhanced convective mantle transport which now beneath an increasingly fractured lithosphere could have created stresses great enough to cause rifting and the separation of crust into plates.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Crustal growth rates ==
[[File:Growthcurve.png|thumb|331x331px|Plots showing the rate of continental crustal growth over time as a percentage of the total mass, along with associated thickness of the newly generated crust. The plot of crustal reworking represents the amount of post formational alteration undergone by the crust. The dramatic increase in crustal reworking and reduction in the rate of crustal growth at approximately 3.6Ga represents the onset of subduction and plate tectonics. Modified from &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;]]

=== Lithological dating ===
Crustal growth rates can be used to calculate estimates for the age of the continental crust. This can be done through analysis of [[igneous rock]]s with the same [[Isotope|isotopic]] composition as initial mantle rock. These igneous rocks are dated and assumed to be direct evidence of new continental crust formation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The resulting ages of isotopically juvenile igneous rocks give distinct peaks, representing an increased proportion of igneous rock and therefore increased crust growth, at 2.7, 1.9 and 1.2 Ga. The validity of these results is questioned as the peaks could represent periods of preservation rather than increased continental crust generation. This is reinforced by the fact that such peaks are not observed in recent geologic time where it is given that [[magmatism]] resulting from the plate subduction has strongly contributed to producing new crust.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawkesworth|first=C. J.|last2=Kemp|first2=A. I. S.|date=2006-10-19|title=Evolution of the continental crust|journal=Nature|volume=443|issue=7113|pages=811–817|doi=10.1038/nature05191|issn=1476-4687|pmid=17051208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crustal growth rates from igneous rocks can be compared to the rates generated from [[Radiogenic nuclide|radiogenic]] isotope ratios in sedimentary rocks. Projections of growth rates using these techniques does not produce staggered peaks, instead smooth shallow curves presenting a more constant rate of crustal growth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although representative of large periods of time, limitations are found where samples do not solely represent magmatic production events. Instead samples include the mixing of sediments which produces a mix of original and altered isotope ratios.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Zircon dating ===
[[Zircon]] minerals can be both [[Detritus (geology)|detrital]] grains from sedimentary rocks and crystals in igneous rocks. Therefore, a combination of zircon forms can provide a more accurate estimate of crustal growth rates. Further to this, zircon minerals can be subject to [[Hafnium|Hf]] and [[Oxygen|O]] isotope ratio analysis.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This is important as Hf isotopes indicate whether a rock originates from the mantle or an existing rock. High δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O values of zircons represent rock recycled at the Earth's surface and thus potentially producing mixed samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Condie|first=K. C.|date=2014-06|title=Growth of continental crust: a balance between preservation and recycling|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/minmag/article/78/3/623/85695/growth-of-continental-crust-a-balance-between|journal=Mineralogical Magazine|language=en|volume=78|issue=3|pages=623–637|doi=10.1180/minmag.2014.078.3.11|issn=0026-461X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of this combined analysis is valid zircons showing periods of increased crustal generation at at 1.9 and 3.3Ga, the latter of which representing the time period following the commencement of global plate tectonics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The '''''Illustrated Bible Dictionary''''',{{efn|Full title: ''Illustrated Bible Dictionary and Treasury of Biblical History, Biography, Geography, Doctrine, and Literature with Numerous Illustrations and Important Chronological Tables and Maps''.{{sfnp|Easton|1893}}}} better known as '''''Easton's Bible Dictionary''''', is a reference work on topics related to the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bible]] compiled by [[Matthew George Easton]]. The first edition was published in 1893,{{sfnp|Easton|1893}} and a revised edition was published the following year.{{sfnp|Easton|1894}} The most popular edition, however, was the third,  published by [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]] in 1897, three years after Easton's death.{{sfnp|Easton|1897}} The last contains nearly 4,000 entries relating to the [[Bible]]. Many of the entries in ''Easton's'' are [[encyclopedia#Characteristics|encyclopedic]] in nature, although there are also short dictionary-type entries.

Because of its age, it is now a [[public domain resource]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8439">In 1996 [[Gregory Stanton]], the president of [[Genocide Watch]], presented a briefing paper called "'''The 8 Stages of [[Genocide]]'''" at the [[United States Department of State]].&lt;ref name=GSGW-1996&gt;[[Gregory Stanton]]. [http://www.genocidewatch.org/aboutgenocide/8stagesofgenocide.html The 8 Stages of Genocide], [[Genocide Watch]], 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In it he suggested that genocide develops in eight stages that are "predictable but not inexorable".&lt;ref name=GSGW-1996/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[FBI]] has found somewhat similar stages for [[Hate groups#Psychopathology of hate groups|hate groups]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Stanton paper was presented at the State Department, shortly after the [[Rwandan Genocide|Rwanda genocide]] and much of the analysis is based on why that genocide occurred. The preventive measures suggested, given the original target audience, were those that the United States could implement directly or use their influence on other governments to have implemented.

! 1.&lt;br /&gt;Classification
| People are divided into "them and us".
| "The main preventive measure at this early stage is to develop universalistic institutions that [[Racial integration|transcend]]... divisions."
|-
! 2.&lt;br /&gt;Symbolization
| "When combined with hatred, symbols may be forced upon unwilling members of pariah groups..."
| "To combat symbolization, hate symbols can be legally forbidden as can [[hate speech]]".
|-
! 3.&lt;br /&gt;[[Dehumanization]]
| "One group denies the humanity of the other group. Members of it are equated with animals, vermin, insects,  or diseases."
| "Local and international leaders should condemn the use of hate speech and make it culturally unacceptable. Leaders who incite genocide should be banned from international travel and have their foreign finances frozen."
|- dunkey

! 4.&lt;br /&gt;Organization
| "Genocide is always organized... Special army units or [[militia]]s are often trained and armed..."
| "The U.N. should impose arms embargoes on governments and citizens of countries involved in [[genocidal massacre]]s, and create commissions to investigate violations"
|-
! 5.&lt;br /&gt;Polarization
| "Hate groups broadcast polarizing propaganda..."
| "Prevention may mean security protection for moderate leaders or assistance to human rights groups...Coups d’état by extremists should be opposed by international sanctions."
|-
! 6.&lt;br /&gt;Preparation
| "Victims are identified and separated out because of their ethnic or religious identity..."
| "At this stage, a Genocide Emergency must be declared. ..."
|-
! 7.&lt;br /&gt;Extermination
| "It is 'extermination' to the killers because they do not believe their victims to be fully human".
| "At this stage, only rapid and overwhelming armed intervention can stop genocide. Real safe areas or refugee escape corridors should be established with heavily armed international protection."
|-
! 8.&lt;br /&gt;[[Genocide denial|Denial]]
| "The perpetrators... deny that they committed any crimes..."
| "The response to denial is punishment by an international tribunal or national courts"
|}

In April 2012, it was reported that Stanton would soon be officially adding two new stages, Discrimination and Persecution, to his original theory, which would make for a 10-stage theory of genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aipr.wordpress.com/2012/04/19/genprev-in-the-news-19-april-2012/|title=GenPrev in the News|date=19 April 2012|work=Auschwitz Institute Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper for the [[Social Science Research Council]] Dirk Moses criticises the Stanton approach concluding:

{{quotation|In view of this rather poor record of ending genocide, the question needs to be asked why the "genocide studies" paradigm cannot predict and prevent genocides with any accuracy and reliability. The paradigm of "genocide studies," as currently constituted in North America in particular, has both strengths and limitations. While the moral fervor and public activism is admirable and salutary, the paradigm appears blind to its own implication in imperial projects that are themselves as much part of the problem as they are part of the solution. The US government called Darfur a genocide to appease domestic lobbies, and because the statement cost it nothing. Darfur will end when it suits the great powers that have a stake in the region.|Dirk Moses&lt;ref&gt;Dirk Moses [http://howgenocidesend.ssrc.org/Moses/ Why the Discipline of "Genocide Studies" Has Trouble Explaining How Genocides End?], [[Social Science Research Council]], 22 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other authors have focused on the structural conditions leading up to genocide and the psychological and social processes that create an evolution toward genocide. Helen Fein&lt;ref&gt;Fein, H. (1979). Accounting for genocide: Victims and survivors of the Holocaust. New York: Fre Press {{Page needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that pre-existing anti-Semitism and systems that maintained anti-Semitic policies was related to the number of Jews killed in different European countries during the Holocaust. Ervin Staub showed that economic deterioration and political confusion and disorganization were starting points of increasing discrimination and violence in many instances of genocides and mass killing. They lead to scapegoating a group and ideologies that identified that group as an enemy. A history of devaluation of the group that becomes the victim, past violence against the group that becomes the perpetrator leading to psychological wounds, authoritarian cultures and political systems, and the passivity of internal and external  (bystanders) all contribute to the probability that the violence develops into genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Staub, E (1989). The roots of evil: The origins of genocide and other group violence. New York: Cambridge University Press.{{page needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intense conflict between groups that is unresolved, becomes intractable and violent can also lead to genocide. The conditions that lead to genocide provide guidance to early prevention, such as humanizing a devalued group, creating ideologies that embrace all groups, and activating bystander responses. There is substantial research to indicate how this can be done, but information is only slowly transformed into action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ervinstaub.com Staub, E. (2011) ''Overcoming evil: Genocide, violent conflict and terrorism'' New York: Oxford University Press.{{page needed|date=April 2012}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

M. Hassan Kakar wrote:

To do that—that is, to commit genocide—the perpetrators need a strong, centralized authority and bureaucratic organization as well as pathological individuals and criminals. Also required is a campaign of vilification and dehumanization of the victims by the perpetrators, who are usually new states or new regimes attempting to impose conformity to a new ideology and its model of society.&lt;ref name=Kakar/&gt;|M.

'''Universidad Nacional de Ciencias Forestales, &lt;nowiki&gt;[[UNACIFOR]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ('''before known as Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Forestales or ESNACIFOR) is a distinguished institution in the field of [[forestry]], not only in [[Honduras]] but also the region of [[Central America]]. The school was created in 1969 as a training center, and now offers two levels of degrees. Students can pursue an Associates or Bachelors in Forestry. Over 1400 professional foresters have graduated from ESNACIFOR, and the demand is always more than the supply. A development plan is in effect that provides reviews of the fundamental strategy every 10 years, tactical plan every five years, and evaluations every three months. The four parts of the school are action areas (training programs), general management, academics, and production and services (income for sustaining the school).

'''''Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)''''' is a book (1969, updated 1999) by U.S. physician [[David Reuben (author)|David Reuben]]. It was one of the first [[sex manual]]s that entered mainstream culture in the 1960s, and had a profound effect on sex education and in liberalizing attitudes towards sex.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/books/news/9902/11/sex/ CNN - Sex doctor David Reuben is back with some new advice] February 5, 1999. Retrieved 7 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the most popular non-fiction book of its era and became part of the [[Sexual Revolution]] of modern America.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

The book was No. 1 best-seller in 51 countries and reached more than 100 million readers.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 1972 it was parodied by [[Woody Allen]] in the [[comedy film]] [[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)|of the same name]] and received a favorable response from movie critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/everything_you_always_wanted_to_know_about_sex_but_were_afraid_to_ask/|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|title=Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, Movie Reviews|accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The table below lists the scores of the PISA 2009 assessment in mathematics and reading by country, as well as the difference between boys and girls. Gaps in bold font mean that the gender gap is [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] ([[p value|p]]&lt;0.05). A positive mathematics gap means that boys outperform girls, a negative mathematics gap means that girls outperform boys. A positive reading gap means that girls outperform boys (no country has a negative reading gap). There is a negative [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] between the mathematics and reading gender gaps, that is, nations with a larger mathematics gap have a smaller reading gap and vice versa.&lt;ref name="stoetgeary2013-se"/&gt;

[[File:Von einem Schrecklichen vnd Wunderbarlichen Cometen so sich den Dienstag nach Martini dieses lauffenden M. D. Lxxvij. Jahrs am Himmel erzeiget hat (grayscale).png|right|thumb|250px|The Great Comet of 1577, depicted in a woodcut, over [[Prague]]]]
A '''great comet''' is a [[comet]] that becomes exceptionally bright. There is no official definition; often the term is attached to comets such as [[Halley's Comet]], which are bright enough to be noticed by casual observers who are not looking for them, and become well known outside the astronomical community. Great comets are rare; on average, only one will appear in a [[decade]]. Although comets are officially named after their discoverers, great comets are sometimes also referred to by the year in which they appeared great, using the formulation "The Great Comet of ...", followed by the year.

== Causes ==
[[File:Verschuier1680.jpg|thumb|250px|The Great Comet of 1680 over [[Rotterdam]] as painted by [[Lieve Verschuier]]]]
The vast majority of comets are never bright enough to be seen by the naked eye, and generally pass through the inner [[Solar System]] unseen by anyone except [[astronomers]]. However, occasionally a comet may brighten to naked eye visibility, and even more rarely it may become as bright as or brighter than the brightest stars. The requirements for this to occur are: a large and active [[cometary nucleus|nucleus]], a close approach to the [[Sun]], and a close approach to the [[Earth]]. A comet fulfilling all three of these criteria will certainly be spectacular. Sometimes, a comet failing on one criterion will still be extremely impressive. For example, [[Comet Hale–Bopp]] had an exceptionally large and active nucleus, but did not approach the Sun very closely at all, yet it still became an extremely famous and well observed comet. Equally, [[Comet Hyakutake]] was a rather small comet, but appeared bright because it passed extremely close to the Earth.

=== Size and activity of the nucleus ===
Cometary nuclei vary in size from a few hundreds of metres across or less to many kilometres across. When they approach the Sun, large amounts of [[gas]] and [[dust]] are ejected by cometary nuclei, due to solar heating. A crucial factor in how bright a comet becomes is how large and how active its nucleus is. After many returns to the inner Solar System, cometary nuclei become depleted in volatile materials and thus are much less bright than comets which are making their first passage through the Solar System.

The sudden brightening of comet [[17P/Holmes]] in 2007 showed the importance of the activity of the nucleus in the comet's brightness. On October 23–24, 2007, the comet suffered a sudden outburst which caused it to brighten by factor of about half a million. It unexpectedly brightened from an [[apparent magnitude]] of about 17 to about 2.8 in a period of only 42 hours, making it visible to the naked eye. All these temporarily made comet 17P the largest (by radius) object in the Solar System although its nucleus is estimated to be only about 3.4&amp;nbsp;km in diameter.

=== Close perihelion approach ===
The brightness of a simple reflective body varies with the [[inverse square]] of its distance from the Sun. That is, if an object's distance from the Sun is halved, its brightness is quadrupled. However, comets behave differently, due to their ejection of large amounts of volatile gas which then also reflect sunlight and may also [[fluorescence|fluoresce]]. Their brightness varies roughly as the inverse cube of their distance from the Sun, meaning that if a comet's distance from the Sun is halved, it will become eight times as bright.

This means that the peak brightness of a comet depends significantly on its distance from the Sun. For most comets, the [[perihelion]] of their orbit lies outside the Earth's orbit. Any comet approaching the Sun to within 0.5 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] or less may have a chance of becoming a great comet.

=== Close approach to the Earth ===
[[Image:Comet Halley.jpg|thumb|185px|right|[[Halley's Comet]]'s 1986 apparition was unusually modest in brightness.]]
For a comet to become spectacular, it also needs to pass close to the Earth if it is to be easily seen. [[Halley's Comet]], for example, is usually very bright when it passes through the inner Solar System every seventy-six years, but during its 1986 [[periodic comet|apparition]], its closest approach to Earth was almost the most distant possible. The comet became visible to the naked eye, but was unspectacular. On the other hand, the intrinsically small and faint [[Comet Hyakutake]] (C/1996 B2) appeared very bright and spectacular due to its very close approach to Earth at its nearest during March 1996. Its passage near the Earth was one of the closest cometary approaches on record.

===History===
In the United States, following the abolition of the film industry's censorious [[Production Code]] and its replacement with the [[MPAA film rating system]] in the late 1960s, some filmmakers began to experiment with subversive&lt;ref name= "Mitchell03"&gt;{{cite news | last = Mitchell | first = Elvis | authorlink = Elvis Mitchell | title = Revisiting Faber College (Toga, Toga, Toga!) | work = [[The New York Times]] | pages =  | language = | publisher = | date=25 August 2003 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/25/movies/critic-s-notebook-revisiting-faber-college-toga-toga-toga.html | accessdate = 2011-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; film comedies, which explicitly dealt with taboo subjects such as sex and other bodily functions.  Noteworthy examples include 1972's ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (in which the central character eats dog excrement) and other films by [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], and 1974's sketch comedy film ''[[The Groove Tube]]''. As these films emerged from the [[counterculture]] movement and gained a measure of audience success,&lt;ref name="Mitchell03"/&gt; they inspired more mainstream films to follow their example. However, long before the Production Code, early silent comedy film makers produced and attempted several 'gross-out' pictures to the disdain of early film reviewers. One such example is the [[lost film|lost]] ''[[Nell's Eugenic Wedding]]'' starring [[Fay Tincher]] and [[Tod Browning]].

The label "gross-out movie" was first applied by the mainstream media to [[1978 in film|1978]]'s ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'s [[Animal House]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernheimer|first=Kathryn|title=The 50 funniest movies of all time : a critic's ranking|year=1999|publisher=Carol Pub.

Some films of this genre could be aimed at teen audiences (such as ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'', ''[[Porky's]]'', ''[[American Pie (series)|American Pie]]'' or ''[[Eurotrip]]''), while others are targeted at somewhat more mature audiences (such as ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', ''[[The Hangover (film)|The Hangover]]'' or ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'').

== Television ==
{{advert|date=June 2012}}

''The Tom Green Show and [[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' and its UK cousin, ''[[Dirty Sanchez (television series)|Dirty Sanchez]]'', were the pioneers of "gross out television".  The shows featured dangerous [[stunts]], [[nudity]], [[profanity]], and action new to the television platform. Both series were featured on [[MTV]], and progressed to feature-length movies.  ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'', ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'', [[Rugrats]], [[Rocko's Modern Life]],  [[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]], and ''[[Animaniacs]]'' transferred the gross-out television genre to the medium of small screen [[animation]] largely in the early 1990s. Today this continues with such shows as ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Futurama]]'', ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', [[Regular Show]], [[American Dad!]] and ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''.

== Theater ==

Gross-out [[theater]] is increasingly practiced on stage, particularly in the [[Edinburgh Festival]]. However, it is also displayed in the larger and more adventurous [[United Kingdom|British]] theaters.

The prime examples of the above are the stage version of the contemporary drama ''[[Trainspotting (novel)#Stage adaptation|Trainspotting]]'' by bestselling playwright and author [[Irvine Welsh]]; the controversial New York musical ''[[Urinetown]]'' by Kotis and Hollmann; the outrageous [[anarchistic]] schlockomedy (shock horror comedy) musical about a Manchester jobcentre ''Restart'' by Komedy Kollective;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.komedykollective.com komedykollective.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and performances by another United Kingdom-based act, Forced Entertainment, who devised the [[iconic]] theatrical [[gorefest]] ''Bloody Mess''.

== Art ==

Controversial American cartoonist and vaudeville performer [[Basil Wolverton]] invented his trademark "[[spaghetti]] and [[meatball]]s" style of artwork.

Various artists helped create a flourishing gross-out art scene, which began mainly in the 1990s, the most famous of which were [[Damien Hirst]], known for encasing mutilated, rotting [[cattle]] in [[formaldehyde]], and making art of [[endangered]] [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[species]] such as [[shark]]s in formaldehyde tanks, and [[Tracey Emin]], whose [[Art exhibition|exhibit]] of an unmade [[bed]] featured used [[tampons]], [[condoms]] and blood-stained [[underwear]].

== Music ==

Gross out themes are common in popular music genres, such as [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[hard rock]], where shock value helps create marketable notoriety.  Bands include [[Blink-182]] famous for including [[breast]] and [[fart]] jokes in their songs, while bands such as [[Cannibal Corpse]] and [[Agoraphobic Nosebleed]] write extremely revolting lyrics designed to induce nausea and shock the music world.

Probably the biggest gross-out shock to the music world was the act of [[GG Allin]]. Allin was infamous for his transgressive music act, which included eating excrement, mutilating himself and attacking audience members.

Sometimes the line between truth and [[urban myth]] is blurred by the [[sensationalist]] sections of the media.  For example, [[Frank Zappa]] never ate steaming excrement live on-stage, and the famed incident involving [[Ozzy Osbourne]] biting a head off of a bat was actually unintentional (he thought the bat was a prop).

Similar themes are also sometimes conveyed in music videos, the aptly named Gross Out, a [[Single (music)|single]] from [[indie (music)|indie]]/[[garage rock]] band, [[The Vines (band)|The Vines]].

'''Harihar Vaman Deshpande''' (5 March 1905 &amp;ndash; 20 April 1965) was born at [[Chendkapur]] ([[Amravati district|Amravati]]) [[Maharashtra]], India.

==Biography==

===Education===
High school education up to 10th standard at Government Hindu High School, Amravati. (1921)
Joined Hanuman Vyayam Prasarak Mandal Amravati in 1918 and was trained in wrestling and other traditional sports.

=== Social and political impact ===

While at H.V.P. Mandal, he was influenced by social and political ideology being practiced in the institute by the founders Anant Krishna and Ambadas Krishna Vaidya under the leadership of the great patriot of Vidarbha Veer Vamanrao Joshi.

Boycotted high school education and joined non-cooperation Movement of Mahatma Gandhi initiated in Vidarbha by Veer Vamanrao Joshi. During the year 1921 he made heavy campaigning in rural area along with his colleagues who boycotted education with him, for creating awareness of N.C. Movement.

Joined ‘Rashtriya Mahavidyalaya’ at Amalner (Distt. Dhulia) and completed his education in 1922.

Passed entrance examination of ‘Tilak Maharashtra Vidyapeeth’ Pune (1923–25) and graduated with a Degree B.A. (Tilak) – "Wangmaya Visharad". Swami Ramanand Tirth and H.R. Mahajani were his batchmates, and their friendship continued in future.

Served as a teacher at ‘Rashtriya Vidyalaya’ Akot Distt. Akola for one year (1926) along with his colleagues. During the year 1927, he worked for H.V.P. Mandal and participated in its activities. He was subsequently deputed to West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh as a propagandist of physical culture and for conducting physical treaining camps at several places on the initiative of "Hindu Maha Sabha"of Calcutta (1928).

While at Gorakhpur in U.P. during such a camp Shivram Hari Rajguru (Compatriot of Sardar Bhagat Singh) visited the camp and met H.V.Deshpande and Dnyaneshwar Deshpande – both of them were close friends of Rajguru at H.V.P.M. (Rajguru was student at H.V.P.M. in 1927).

During his stay in U.P. for the camps he came in contact with national leaders like Pt. Madan Mohan Malviya and Lal Bahadur Shastri, who were associated and active in the working of Hindu Maha Sabha.

In 1929 he, along with his two colleagues, namely T.G. Joshi and V.B. alias Babasaheb Vaidya, went to Lahore to attend All India Session of Indian National Congress.

For his active involvement in non-cooperation movement during 1929 and 1930, he was arrested and sentenced to Jail in 1930 for a year. Again in 1932 he was arrested and sent to jail for rigorous punishment by British Government.

Soon after release from jail he again involved in organizing Berar Youth League and its conferences (1933-34).

Helped actively in conducting All-India Training Camp of "Hindustani Seva Dal" at Borivali (Mumbai) in 1931.

Organized 22 Taluka Congress Committee in Vidarbha Region (1931).

Elected as a Secretary of ‘Vidarbha Pradesh Congress Committee’ and member of All-India Congress Committee (AICC) - 1930-34.

Organized and helped Provincial and All India Conferences for supporting Registration Bill of Ayurvedic Practitioners - 1937-39.

Recruited and conducted Training Camp of 3000 volunteers from Madhya Pradeh and Mahakoshal with his colleagues on behalf of H.V.P.Mandal for the service during the All India Session of AICC at Tripuri (Jabalpur) held in 1939. He was appointed Chief Organizer of the Volunteers Corps. He came in contact with various national leaders like Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhash Chandra Bose.

Organizer of the HVPM team of 150 members to participate in Golden Jubilee of Indian National Congress held at Govalia Tank Maidan Mumbai 1937. Prior to Mumbai the team had its display of traditional physical activities at Baroda and Surat where Maharaja Sayajirao Gaikwad and Sardar Vallabha Bhai Patel respectively presided over the programme.

1940-42 –actively involved in’Quit India Movement" for which he was again arrested and jailed for more than six months.

=== Government service ===

Appointed and served as Liaison &amp; Welfare Officer in Home Guard Department of Ex-M.P.Government (1947–1956) Subsequently served on the said post in the same Department of Maharashtra Government (1956–1960)

=== International contacts ===

Being Chief Organizer of the Indian Lingiad Team and having his visit to several countries he developed contacts with the physical education experts, sports persons and institutions of Germany, Sweden. Denmark, England and Switzerland.

===Death and afterward===

'''Life through 1960–65:'''

Resigned Government service (1960) and accepted Managing Editorship of "Aarogya Mandir" monthly magazine of Panvel. He started publishing magazine from Amravati (1960–63).

Subsequent to the closure of publication by the management, he turned towards Gandhi Smarak Nidhi as Organizer of the Gandhi Study Centre at Amravati where he organized library (1961–64)for general public, periodical lectures on Gandhian ideology and allied topics.

'''Death:'''

Towards the end of 1964 he developed health problem. His health deteriorated further and was subsequently hospitalized at Govt. Medical College Hospital where he was expired on 20 April 1965.

A '''hydroid''' is a type of vascular [[Cell (biology)|cell]] that occurs in certain [[bryophyte]]s. In some [[moss]]es such as members of the [[Polytrichaceae]] family, hydroids form the innermost layer of cells in the stem. At maturity they are long, colourless, thin walled cells of small diameter, containing water but no living [[protoplasm]]. Collectively, hydroids function as a conducting tissue, known as the hydrome, transporting water and minerals drawn from the soil. They are surrounded by bundles of living cells known as [[leptoid]]s which carry sugars and other nutrients in solution. The hydroids are analogous to the [[tracheid]]s of vascular plants but there is no [[lignin]] present in the cell walls to provide structural support.&lt;ref name=mishler1984&gt;{{Cite journal

Hydroids have been found in some fossilised plants from the [[Rhynie chert]], including ''[[Aglaophyton]]'', where they were initially mistaken for [[xylem]] tracheids.

In the subject area of [[control theory]], an '''internal model''' is a process that simulates the response of the system in order to estimate the outcome of a system disturbance.  The '''internal model principle''' was first articulated in 1976 by B. A. Francis and W. M. Wonham&lt;ref&gt;B. A. Francis and W. M. Wonham, "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Walter_Wonham/publication/223996193_The_internal_model_principle_of_control_theory/links/5488b5610cf289302e30b828.pdf The internal model principle of control theory]", ''Automatica'' '''12''' (1976) 457–465.&lt;/ref&gt; as an explicit formulation of the Conant and Ashby [[good regulator]] theorem.
&lt;ref&gt;Roger C. Conant and W. Ross Ashby, "[http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Books/Conant_Ashby.pdf Every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system]", ''International Journal of Systems Science'' vol '''1''' (1970), 89–97.&lt;/ref&gt; It stands in contrast to classical control, in that the classical [[feedback loop]] fails to explicitly model the controlled system (although the classical controller may contain an implicit model).&lt;ref&gt;Jan Swevers, "[https://people.mech.kuleuven.be/~jswevers/h04x3a/lecture_c9_c10.pdf Internal model control (IMC)]", 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry Y. Li, "[http://www.me.umn.edu/courses/me8281/notes/Old%20S06/Chapter%208%20IMP-repetitive.pdf Internal Model Principle and Repetitive Control]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The  internal model theory of motor control argues that the motor system is controlled by the constant interactions of the “[[Plant (control theory)|plant]]” and the “[[Controller (control theory)|controller]].” The plant is the body part being controlled, while the internal model itself is considered part of the controller. Information from the controller, such as information from the [[Central nervous system|central nervous system (CNS)]], feedback information, and the [[efference copy]], is sent to the plant which moves accordingly.

Internal models can be controlled through either [[Feed forward (control)|feed-forward]] or [[feedback]] control. Feed-forward control computes its input into a system using only the current state and its model of the system.  It does not use feedback, so it cannot correct for errors in its control. In feedback control, some of the output of the system can be fed back into the system’s input, and the system is then able to make adjustments or compensate for errors from its desired output. Two primary types of internal models have been proposed:  forward models and inverse models. In simulations, models can be combined together to solve more complex movement tasks.

==Forward models==
[[Image:Basic Internal Model.png|thumb|725px|Figure 1. The desired position of the body is the reference input to the hypothetical controller, which generates the necessary motor command. This motor command is sent to the plant to move the body and an efference copy of the motor command is sent to a forward model. The output from the forward model (predicted body position) is compared with the output from the plant (body position). Noise from the system or the environment may cause differences between the actual and predicted body positions. The error (difference) between the actual and predicted positions can provide feedback to improve the movement for the next iteration of the internal model.]]

In their simplest form, forward models take the input of a motor command to the “plant” and output a predicted position of the body.

The motor command input to the forward model can be an efference copy, as seen in Figure 1. The output from that forward model, the predicted position of the body, is then compared with the actual position of the body. The actual and predicted position of the body may differ due to noise introduced into the system by either internal (e.g. body sensors are not perfect, sensory noise) or external (e.g. unpredictable forces from outside the body) sources. If the actual and predicted body positions differ, the difference can be fed back as an input into the entire system again so that an adjusted set of motor commands can be formed to create a more accurate movement.

==Inverse models==

[[Image:Inverse Model.png|thumb|700px|Figure 2. Inverse model of a reaching task. The arm’s desired trajectory, Xref(t), is input into the model, which generates the necessary motor commands, ũ(t), to control the arm.]]

Inverse models  use the desired and actual position of the body as inputs to estimate the necessary motor commands which would transform the current position into the desired one. For example, in an arm reaching task, the desired position (or a trajectory of consecutive positions) of the arm is input into the postulated inverse model, and the inverse model generates the motor commands needed to control the arm and bring it into this desired configuration (Figure 2). Inverse internal models are also in close connection with [[Motor coordination#Uncontrolled manifold hypothesis|the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis (UCM)]], see also [[Degrees of freedom problem#Uncontrolled manifold (UCM) hypothesis|here]].

==Combined forward and inverse models==

Theoretical work has shown that in models of motor control, when inverse models are used in combination with a forward model, the efference copy of the motor command output from the inverse model can be used as an input to a forward model for further predictions. For example, if, in addition to reaching with the arm, the hand must be controlled to grab an object, an efference copy of the arm motor command can be input into a forward model to estimate the arm's predicted trajectory. With this information, the controller can then generate the appropriate motor command telling the hand to grab the object. It has been proposed that if they exist, this combination of inverse and forward models would allow the CNS to take a desired action (reach with the arm), accurately control the reach and then accurately control the hand to grip an object.&lt;ref name="Kawato"&gt;{{cite journal| last= Kawato| first=M |year=1999 |title=Internal models for motor control and trajectory planning |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |volume=9 |pages=718–727 | doi= 10.1016/S0959-4388(99)00028-8| pmid= 10607637| issue= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptive Control theory==

With the assumption that new models can be acquired and pre-existing models can be updated, the efference copy is important for the adaptive control of a movement task. Throughout the duration of a motor task, an efference copy is fed into a forward model known as a dynamics predictor whose output allows prediction of the motor output. When applying [[adaptive control|adaptive control theory]] techniques to motor control, efference copy is used in indirect control schemes as the input to the reference model.

==Scientists ==
A wide range of scientists contribute to progress on the internal model hypothesis. [[Michael I. Jordan]], [[Emmanuel Todorov]] and 
[[Daniel Mark Wolpert|Daniel Wolpert]] contributed significantly to the mathematical formalization. [[Sandro Mussa-Ivaldi]], [[Mitsuo Kawato]], [[Claude Ghez]],  [[Reza Shadmehr]], [[Randy Flanagan]] and [[Konrad Kording]] contributed with numerous behavioral experiments. The [[Neurocomputational speech processing#DIVA model|DIVA model]] of speech production developed by [[Frank H. Guenther]] and colleagues uses combined forward and inverse models to produce auditory trajectories with simulated speech articulators. Two interesting inverse internal models for the control of speech production&lt;ref&gt;Also with simulated speech articulators, such as biomechanical tongue models (BTM).&lt;/ref&gt; were developed by Iaroslav Blagouchine &amp; Eric Moreau.&lt;ref name="iaroslav_02"&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Iaroslav_Blagouchine/publication/224080014_Control_of_a_Speech_Robot_via_an_Optimum_Neural-Network-Based_Internal_Model_With_Constraints Iaroslav Blagouchine and Eric Moreau. ''Control of a Speech Robot via an Optimum Neural-Network-Based Internal Model with Constraints.'' IEEE Transactions on Robotics, vol. 26, no. 1, pp. 142—159, February 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; Both models combine the optimum principles and the [[Degrees of freedom problem#Equilibrium point hypothesis and threshold control|equilibrium-point hypothesis]] (motor commands λ are taken as coordinates of the internal space). The input motor command λ is found by minimizing the length of the path traveled in the internal space, either under the acoustical constraint (the first model), or under the both acoustical and mechanical constraints (the second model). The acoustical constraint is related to the quality of the produced speech (measured in terms of [[formants]]), while the mechanical one is related to the [[stiffness]] of the tongue's body. The first model, in which the stiffness remains uncontrolled, is in agreement with [[Degrees of freedom problem#Uncontrolled manifold (UCM) hypothesis|the standard UCM hypothesis]]. In contrast, the second optimum internal model, in which the stiffness is prescribed, displays the good variability of speech (at least, in the reasonable range of stiffness) and is in agreement with [[Motor coordination#Uncontrolled Manifold Hypothesis|the more recent versions of the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis (UCM)]]. There is also a rich clinical literature on internal models including work from [[John Krakauer]]&lt;!-- no, NOT [[Jon Krakauer]] --&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:bLn4MUPq5U4J:www.columbiampl.org/pdf/Papers/Tseng07ErrorsCerebell.pdf+%22John+Krakauer,%22+%22internal+model%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiTHb8WkJbZVoI63GEsv9CyGUEbcwWZ1EVxwMFOtcsrMm5-GKaU_nvdT0Z3OMNuU94rJjE6MfxYqBxCgMa09wKFeewbKaQmhxJn_IL-oFih9zlZaCNJKtuQyYZQnOxa8w0vZ0Zi&amp;sig=AHIEtbSxSGDAskWo_Njt1nHs91MsHbqc4A "Sensory Prediction Errors Drive Cerebellum-Dependent Adaptation of Reaching"], Tseng, Diedrichsen, Krakauer, et al., ''Journal of Neurophysiology, 98:54-62, May 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pietro Mazzoni]], [[Maurice A.

The '''Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach''' ({{lang-de|Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach}}) in [[Oberwolfach]], [[Germany]], was founded by mathematician [[Wilhelm Süss]] in 1944.

It organizes weekly workshops on diverse topics where mathematicians and scientists from all over the world come to do collaborative research.

The Institute is a member of the [[Leibniz Association]], funded mainly by the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)| German Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] and by the state of [[Baden-Württemberg]]. It also receives substantial funding from the ''Friends of Oberwolfach'' foundation, from the ''Oberwolfach Foundation'' and from numerous donors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4877">As coined in the writings of [[Marshall McLuhan]], '''metamedia''' referred to new relationships between [[form and content]] in the development of new [[technologies]] and new [[wiktionary:media#Etymology_2|media]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'' (1964) Marshall McLuhan&lt;/ref&gt; [REFERENCE NEEDED: The book Understanding Media doesn't once use the word metamedia, meta-media, meta-medium or metamedium.]  

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the term was taken up by writers such as [[Douglas Rushkoff]] and [[Lev Manovich]]. Contemporary metamedia, such as at Stanford, has been expanded to describe, "a short circuit between the [[academy]], the [[art studio]] and [[information science]] exploring media and their archaeological materiality."&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt; Metamedia utilizes [[new media]] and focuses on collaboration across traditional fields of study, melding everything from  [[improvisational]] theatre and performance art, to [[Agile software development|agile, adaptive software development]] and [[smart mobs]].

==Development==
{{rquote|right|The new avant-garde is no longer concerned with seeing or representing the world in new ways but rather with accessing and using in new ways previously accumulated media. In this respect new media is post-media or meta-media, as it uses old media as its primary material.|[[Lev Manovich]]}}
While [[hypermedia]] was coined a year later in 1965 by a programmer to refer to [[file system]]s of [[multimedia]], the term metamedia was coined in 1964, referring to the theoretical effects of mass media. McLuhan, like his teacher [[Harold Innis]], an earlier theorist of [[communication theory]], saw communication as central to social systems. 

More recent distinctions between old and [[new media]] have meant that metamedia becomes used to describe modernity and art more than systems.

===As an academic field of study===
[[Stanford University]] Humanities Lab and [[MIT]] currently run research labs investigating metamedia.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metamedia.stanford.edu/ |title=metamedia.stanford.edu |work=Metamedia: a collaboratory at Stanford University |accessdate=2008-05-20 |publisher=Affiliated with Stanford Humanities Lab |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040604022515/http://metamedia.stanford.edu/ |archivedate=2004-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metamedia.mit.edu/ |title=metamedia.mit.edu |accessdate=2008-05-20 |publisher=MIT |work=Metamedia: transforming humanities education at MIT }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MIT lab's mission is to provide a flexible online environment for creating and sharing [[rich media]] documents for learning on core humanities subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metamedia.mit.edu/overview.html |title=What is Metamedia? |work=metamedia.mit.edu |accessdate=2008-05-20 |publisher=MIT |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20041204115327/http://metamedia.mit.edu/overview.html |archivedate=2004-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is led by [[Kurt Fendt]] (co-Principal Investigator and Manager of the Metamedia project) and [[Henry Jenkins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/13380/ |title=Humanities Go Digital: Innovative multimedia programs give students new ways to study languages, literature, and the arts. |accessdate=2008-05-20 |first=Megan |last=Vandre |work=[[Technology Review]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanford's lab is principally facilitated by [[Michael Shanks]] with other collaborators, including [[Howard Rheingold]] and [[Fred Turner (academic)]]. In its mission statement, it describes itself as a "creative studio and laboratory space for experimenting and taking risks...a democratic and collaborative assembly of archaeologists, anthropologists, classicists, communications experts, new media practitioners, performance artists, sociologists, software engineers, technoscientists, and anyone else who wants to join."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanitieslab.stanford.edu/Metamedia/463 |work=Mission statement |publisher=Metamedia at Stanford |title=humanitieslab.stanford.edu |accessdate=2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent project is Life Squared (aka Life to the Second Power), an animated archive of the work of artist [[Lynn Hershman]] in the online world [[Second Life]].

{{Conservation status}}

A '''near-threatened species''' is a [[species]] which has been [[Conservation status|categorized]] as "'''Near Threatened'''" (NT) by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] as that may be considered [[Threatened species|threatened]] with [[extinct]]ion in the near future, although it does not currently qualify for the threatened status. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] notes the importance of re-evaluating near-threatened [[taxa]] at appropriate intervals.

The rationale used for near-threatened taxa usually includes the criteria of [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] which are plausible or nearly met, such as reduction in numbers or range. Near-threatened species evaluated from 2001 onwards may also be ones which are dependent on conservation efforts to prevent their becoming threatened, whereas prior to this [[conservation-dependent species]] were given a separate category ("Conservation Dependent").

Additionally, the 402 conservation-dependent taxa may also be considered near-threatened.

== IUCN Categories and Criteria version 2.3 ==
[[File:Status iucn2.3 NT.svg|left|Diagram of ''{{nowrap|Lower Risk{{\}}near threatened}}'' in the older IUCN version 2.3, beside the former ''{{nowrap|Lower Risk{{\}}conservation dependent}}'' subcategory.]]

Prior to 2001, the IUCN used the version 2.3 Categories and Criteria to assign [[conservation status]], which included a separate category for [[conservation-dependent]] species ("Conservation Dependent", LR/cd). With this category system, Near Threatened and Conservation Dependent were both subcategories of the category "Lower Risk". Taxa which were last evaluated prior to 2001 may retain their LR/cd or LR/nt status, although had the category been assigned with the same information today the species would be designated simply "Near Threatened (NT)" in either case.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10448">The '''Orton-Gillingham''' Approach to [[Reading (activity)|reading]] instruction was developed in the early-20th century.

It is language-based, multisensory, structured, sequential, cumulative, [[cognitive]], and flexible.&lt;ref&gt;The structured flexibility of Orton-GillinghamBB Sheffield - Annals of Dyslexia, 1991 - Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orton-Gillingham Approach has been in use since the 1930s.  An intensive, sequential [[phonics]]-based system teaches the basics of word formation before whole meanings. The method accommodates and utilizes three learning modalities, or pathways, through which people learn&amp;mdash;visual, auditory and kinesthetic. Unlike some scripted and rigid reading programs, the Orton-Gillingham Approach is a system that allows for flexibility.

== Orton and Gillingham ==

[[Samuel Orton|Samuel Torrey Orton]] (1879&amp;ndash;1948), a neuropsychiatrist and [[pathologist]] at [[Columbia University]], brought together neuroscientific information and principles of remediation. As early as the 1920s, he had extensively studied children with the kind of language processing difficulties now commonly associated with [[dyslexia]] and had formulated a set of teaching principles and practices for such children.

[[Anna Gillingham]] (1878&amp;ndash;1963) was an [[educator]] and [[psychologist]] at Teachers College, [[Columbia University]].  Working with Dr. Orton, she trained teachers and compiled and published instructional materials. Gillingham combined Orton’s teaching methods with her analysis of the structure of the English/American language and with Bessie Stillman, she wrote what has become the Orton–Gillingham manual: Remedial Training for Children with Specific Disability in Reading, Spelling and Penmanship. First published in 1935/6, this work is updated and republished regularly.

== Features of the Approach ==

'''Language-based''': The Orton-Gillingham approach is based on a technique of studying and teaching language, understanding the nature of human language, the mechanisms involved in learning, and the language-learning processes in individuals.

'''Multisensory''': Orton-Gillingham teaching sessions are action-oriented and involve constant interaction between the teacher and the student and the simultaneous use of multiple sensory input channels reinforcing each other for optimal learning. Using auditory, visual, and kinesthetic elements, all language skills taught are reinforced by having the student listen, speak, read and write. For example, a dyslexic learner is taught to see the letter A, say its name and sound and write it in the air – all at the same time. The approach requires intense instruction with ample practice.
The use of multiple input channels is thought to enhance memory storage and retrieval by providing multiple "triggers" for memory.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, Gordon. Can Neuroscience Help to Demystify Dyslexia?  Schwab Learning. Retrieved from http://www.schwablearning.org/articles.aspx?r=430 October 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structured, Sequential, and Cumulative''': The Orton-Gillingham teacher introduces the elements of the language systematically. Sound-symbol associations along with linguistic rules and generalizations are introduced in a linguistically logical, understandable order.  Students begin by reading and writing sounds in isolation. Then they blend the sounds into syllables and words. Students learn the elements of language—consonants, vowels, [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], blends, and [[diphthongs]]&amp;mdash;in an orderly fashion. They then proceed to advanced structural elements such as syllable types, roots, and affixes. As students learn new material, they continue to review old material to the level of automaticity. The teacher addresses vocabulary, sentence structure, composition, and reading comprehension in a similar structured, sequential, and cumulative manner.

'''Cognitive''': Students learn about the history of the [[English language]] and study the many generalizations and rules that govern its structure. They also learn how best they can learn and apply the language knowledge necessary for achieving reading and writing competencies.

'''Flexible''': Orton-Gillingham teaching is diagnostic and prescriptive in nature. Teachers try to ensure the learner is not simply recognising a pattern and applying it without understanding. When confusion of a previously taught rule is discovered, it is re-taught from the beginning.

== Research support ==
In 2000, the National Reading Panel included the Orton-Gillingham method in their study, "Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-Based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and Its Implications for Reading Instruction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langengerg, Ph.D|first1=Daniel|title=Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-Based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and Its Implications for Reading Instruction|url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/nrp/documents/report.pdf|website=National Reading Panel|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Panel supported the significance of offering classroom instruction in phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=S.|title=The Orton-Gillingham Language Approach - A Research Review|date=10 February 2014|page=7|url=http://www.nessy.com/us/files/2014/06/Orton-Gillingham_Report-Final-Version.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Florida Center for Reading Research reported in 2006 that it was unable to identify any empirical studies examining the efficacy of the approach specifically as described in Orton-Gillingham training materials. Thus there was no direct research evidence to determine its effectiveness, although there are a variety of  studies of derivative methods that incorporate aspects of Orton-Gillingham in combination with other techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

An overview of all reported studies of Orton-Gillingham derivative methods, such as Alphabetic Phonics or Project Read, revealed only a dozen studies with inconsistent results and a variety of methodological flaws. Despite these conclusions, the article does provide a detailed overview of the available research, which viewed most favorably would show some evidence of benefit from [[classroom]] use of OG methods with first graders, and use in [[special education]] or [[resource room]] settings with older children with [[learning disabilities]].&lt;ref name=Ritchey2006&gt;{{cite journal

In July 2010, a US Department of Education agency reported that it could not find any studies meeting its evidence standards to support the efficacy of Orton-Gillingham based strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

One study found it was effective for students who were English Language Learners.&lt;ref&gt;Use of an Orton-Gillingham approach to teach a [[foreign language]] to dyslexic/learning-disabled students: Explicit teaching of phonology in a second language.

Research has indicated the system is effective in remediating instruction for students with [[dyslexia]],&lt;ref&gt;DYSLEXIA REVISITED: HISTORY, EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY, AND CLINICAL ASSESSMENT APPLICATIONS.KJ Rooney - ''Intervention in School &amp; Clinic'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt; although further research mentions that its efficacy is yet to be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turner, III|first1=Herbert M.|title=This systematic review empirically documents that the effectiveness of Orton-Gillingham and Orton-Gillingham-based reading instruction remains to be determined|journal=Evidence-Based Communication Assessment and Intervention|date=June 2008|volume=2|issue=2|pages=67–69|doi=10.1080/17489530802037564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and a topical guide to [[nutrition]].

Nutrition is the study of the relationship between [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and states of [[health]] and [[disease]]. The scope of nutrition science ranges from [[malnutrition]] to optimal health. Many common symptoms and diseases can often be prevented or alleviated with better nutrition. It is also called nutrition science.

==Overview==
Petroleum production engineers' responsibilities include:

# Evaluating inflow and outflow performance between the [[Petroleum reservoir|reservoir]] and the [[wellbore]].
# Designing [[Completion (oil and gas wells)|completion systems]], including [[Production tubing|tubing]] selection, [[Perforation (oil well)|perforating]], sand control, matrix stimulation, and [[hydraulic fracturing]].
# Selecting [[artificial lift]] equipment, including sucker-rod lift (typically [[Pumpjack|beam pumping]]), gas lift, electrical submersible pumps, subsurface hydraulic pumps, progressing-cavity pumps, and plunger lift.
# Selecting ( not design ) equipment for surface facilities that [[Separator (oil production)|separate]] and measure the produced fluids (oil, natural gas, water, and impurities), prepare the oil and gas for transportation to market, and handle disposal of any water and impurities.
Note: Surface equipments are designed by Chemical engineers and Mechanical engineers according to data provided by the production engineers.

==Suggested reading==
*''Journal of Petroleum Technology'', [[Society of Petroleum Engineers]]
Outflow should be defined as flow from the casing perforations to the surface facilities.

'''''Philip Dru: Administrator: A Story of Tomorrow, 1920-1935''''' is a futuristic [[political novel]] published anonymously in 1912 by author [[Edward M. House|Edward Mandell House]], an American diplomat, politician, and presidential foreign policy advisor.  According to historians, House highly prized his work and gave a copy of ''Dru'' to his closest political ally, [[Woodrow Wilson]], to read while on a trip to Bermuda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=g1IgBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74 Colonel House: A Biography of Woodrow Wilson's Silent Partner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4jcL20ZS_KUC&amp;pg=PA53 Woodrow Wilson's Right Hand: The Life of Colonel Edward M.

==Book reviews==
Historian [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] wrote: "Oddly enough, in 1911 he [House] had published a political novel, ''Philip Dru: Administrator'', in which a benevolent dictator imposed a corporate income tax, abolished the protective tariff, and broke up the 'credit trust'—a remarkable adumbration of [[Woodrow Wilson|[Woodrow] Wilson]] and his first term."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnson | first = Paul |authorlink = Paul Johnson (writer) | title = A History of the American People | publisher = HarperPerennial | location = New York | year = 1999 | pages = 635–636| isbn = 0060930349 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billie Jensen, a historian from the [[University of Kansas]] noted that "''Philip Dru was obviously an expression both of House's ambition and his political dreams and it was an expression of the ideas of the man who had an impressive amount of influence on Woodrow Wilson.  Seldom have the elements of a utopia been implemented so soon as the reforms of Philip Dru were; seldom has a utopian reformer been as influential as House was.  For these reasons, Philip Dru is a significant political document.''&lt;ref name=Jensen&gt;[https://libprdojsap.lib.ku.edu/amerstud/article/view/2434 Philip Dru, The Blueprint of a Presidential Adviser]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book review for [[The New York Times]], [[Walter Lippmann]] wrote of the novel and its anonymous author that "''if the author is really a man of affairs, this is an extraordinarily interesting book''".&lt;ref&gt;[*[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A07E5DB1E3AE633A2575BC0A9649D946396D6CF AMERICA'S FUTURE; Pictured in a Decidedly Quaint Modern Novel], [[Walter Lippmann]], December 8, 1912]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pictorialism''' is the name given to an international style and aesthetic movement that dominated [[photography]] during the later 19th and early 20th centuries. There is no standard definition of the term, but in general it refers to a style in which the photographer has somehow manipulated what would otherwise be a straightforward photograph as a means of "creating" an image rather than simply recording it. Typically, a pictorial photograph appears to lack a sharp focus (some more so than others), is printed in one or more colors other than black-and-white (ranging from warm brown to deep blue) and may have visible brush strokes or other manipulation of the surface. For the pictorialist, a photograph, like a painting, drawing or engraving, was a way of projecting an emotional intent into the viewer's realm of imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Daum, p 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Pictorialism as a movement thrived from about 1885 to 1915, although it was still being promoted by some as late as the 1940s. It began in response to claims that a photograph was nothing more than a simple record of reality, and transformed into an international movement to advance the status of all photography as a true art form. For more than three decades painters, photographers and art critics debated opposing artistic philosophies, ultimately culminating in the acquisition of photographs by several major art museums.

Pictorialism gradually declined in popularity after 1920, although it did not fade out of popularity until the end of [[World War II]]. During this period the new style of photographic [[Modernism]] came into vogue, and the public's interest shifted to more sharply focused images. Several important 20th-century photographers began their careers in a pictorialist style but transitioned into sharply focused photography by the 1930s.

==Overview==

[[Image:Watson-Schutze-Rose.jpg|thumb|upright|"The Rose", by [[Eva Watson-Schütze]], 1905]]

Photography as a technical process involving the development of film and prints in a darkroom originated in the early 19th century, with the forerunners of traditional photographic prints coming into prominence around 1838 to 1840. Not long after the new medium was established, photographers, painters and others began to argue about the relationship between the scientific and artistic aspects of the medium. As early as 1853, English painter William John Newton proposed that the camera could produce artistic results if the photographer would keep an image slightly out of focus.&lt;ref&gt;Doty, p 11&lt;/ref&gt; Others vehemently believed  that a photograph was equivalent to the visual record of a chemistry experiment. Photography historian Naomi Rosenblum points out that "the dual character of the medium — its capacity to produce both art and document — [was] demonstrated soon after its discovery&amp;nbsp;... Nevertheless, a good part of the nineteenth century was spent debating which of these directions was the medium's true function."&lt;ref&gt;In Johnson, p 121&lt;/ref&gt;

These debates reached their peak during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, culminating in the creation of a movement that is usually characterized as a particular style of photography: pictorialism. This style is defined first by a distinctly personal expression that emphasizes photography's ability  to create visual beauty rather than simply record facts.&lt;ref&gt;McCarroll, p 17&lt;/ref&gt; However, recently historians have recognized that pictorialism is more than just a visual style. It evolved in direct context with the changing social and cultural attitudes of the time, and, as such, it should not be characterized simply as a visual trend. One writer has noted that pictorialism was "simultaneously a movement, a philosophy, an aesthetic and a style."&lt;ref&gt;Nordström and David Wooters. "Crafting the Art of the Photograph." In Pardon, p 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to what some histories of photography portray, pictorialism did not come about as the result of a linear evolution of artistic sensibilities; rather, it was formed through "an intricate, divergent, often passionately conflicting barrage of strategies."&lt;ref&gt;Sternberger, p xi&lt;/ref&gt; While photographers and others debated whether photography could be art, the advent of photography directly affected the roles and livelihoods of many traditional artists. Prior to the development of photography, a painted [[Portrait miniature|miniature portrait]] was the most common means of recording a person's likeness. Thousands of painters were engaged in this art form. But photography quickly negated the need for and interest in miniature portraits. One example of this effect was seen at the annual exhibition of the [[Royal Academy]] in London; in 1830 more than 300 miniature paintings were exhibited, but by 1870 only 33 were on display.&lt;ref&gt;Harker, p 16&lt;/ref&gt; Photography had taken over for one type of art form, but the question of whether photography itself could be artistic had not been resolved.

Some painters soon adopted photography as a tool to help them record a model's pose, a landscape scene or other elements to include in their art. It's known that many of the great 19th-century painters, including [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Gustav Courbet|Courbet]], [[Manet]], [[Degas]], [[Cézanne]], and [[Gauguin]], took photographs themselves, used photographs by others and incorporated images from photographs into their work.&lt;ref&gt;Scharf, p&amp;nbsp;10–12&lt;/ref&gt; While heated debates about the relationship between photography and art continued in print and in lecture halls, the distinction between a photographic image and a painting became more and more difficult to discern. As photography continued to develop, the interactions between painting and photography became increasingly reciprocal.&lt;ref name="Harker, p 19"&gt;Harker, p 19&lt;/ref&gt; More than a few pictorial photographers, including [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]], [[Edward Steichen]], [[Gertrude Käsebier]], [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander]], and [[Sarah Choate Sears]], were originally trained as painters or took up painting in addition to their photographic skills.

It was during this same period that cultures and societies around the world were being affected by a rapid increase in intercontinental travel and commerce. Books and magazines published on one continent could be exported and sold on another with increasing ease, and the development of reliable mail services facilitated individual exchanges of ideas, techniques and, most importantly for photography, actual prints. These developments led to pictorialism being "a more international movement in photography than almost any other photographic genre."&lt;ref&gt;McCarroll, p 10&lt;/ref&gt; Camera clubs in the U.S., England, France, Germany, Austria, Japan and other countries regularly lent works to each other's exhibitions, exchanged technical information and published essays and critical commentaries in one another's journals. Led by [[The Linked Ring]] in England, the [[Photo-Secession]] in the U.S., and the [[Photo-Club de Paris]] in France, first hundreds and then thousands of photographers passionately pursued common interests in this multi-dimensional movement. Within the span of little more than a decade, notable pictorial photographers were found in Western and Eastern Europe, North America, Asia and Australia.

==The impact of Kodak cameras==

For the first forty years after a practical process of capturing and reproducing images was invented, photography remained the domain of a highly dedicated group of individuals who had expert knowledge of and skills in science, mechanics and art. To make a photograph, a person had to learn a great deal about chemistry, optics, light, the mechanics of cameras and how these factors combine to properly render a scene. It was not something that one learned easily or engaged in lightly, and, as such, it was limited to a relatively small group of academics, scientists and professional photographers.

[[Image:Kodak ad 1888.GIF|thumb|left|Ad for a [[Kodak]] camera, 1888 - "No knowledge of photography is necessary."]]
All of that changed in a few years' time span. In 1888 [[George Eastman]] introduced the first handheld amateur camera, the [[Kodak]] camera. It was marketed with the slogan "You press the button, we do the rest."&lt;ref name=PIC&gt;Wilson, p 1&lt;/ref&gt; The camera was pre-loaded with a roll of film that produced about 100 2.5" round pictures exposures, and it could easily be carried and handheld during its operation. After all of the shots on the film were exposed, the whole camera was returned to the Kodak company in Rochester, New York, where the film was developed, prints were made, and new photographic film was placed inside. Then the camera and prints were returned to the customer, who was ready to take more pictures.

The impact of this change was enormous. Suddenly almost anyone could take a photograph, and within the span of a few years photography became one of the biggest [[fad]]s in the world. Photography collector Michael Wilson observed "Thousands of commercial photographers and a hundred times as many amateurs were producing millions of photographs annually&amp;nbsp;... The decline in the quality of professional work and the deluge of snapshots (a term borrowed from hunting, meaning to get off a quick shot without taking the time to aim) resulted in a world awash with technically good but aesthetically indifferent photographs."&lt;ref name=PIC/&gt;

Concurrent with this change was the development of national and international commercial  enterprises to meet the new demand for cameras, films and prints. At the 1893 [[World Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, which attracted more than 27 million people, photography for amateurs was marketed at an unprecedented scale.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p 24&lt;/ref&gt; There were multiple large exhibits displaying photographs from around the world, many camera and darkroom equipment manufacturers showing and selling their latest goods, dozens of portrait studios and even on-the-spot documentation of the Exposition itself. Suddenly photography and photographers were household commodities.

Many serious photographers were appalled. Their craft, and to some their art, was being co-opted by a newly engaged, uncontrolled and mostly untalented citizenry. The debate about art and photography intensified around the argument that if anyone could take a photograph then photography could not possibly be called art. Some of the most passionate defenders of photography as art pointed out that photography should not and cannot be seen as an "either/or" medium ‒ some photographs are indeed simple records of reality, but with the right elements some are indeed works of art. William Howe Downs, art critic for the ''Boston Evening Transcript'', summed up this position in 1900 by saying "Art is not so much a matter of methods and processes as it is an affair of temperament, of taste and of sentiment&amp;nbsp;... In the hands of the artist, the photograph becomes a work of art&amp;nbsp;... In a word, photography is what the photographer makes it ‒ an art or a trade."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblum, p 296&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these elements ‒ the debates over photography and art, the impacts of Kodak cameras, and the changing social and cultural values of the times ‒ combined to set the stage for an evolution in how art and photography, independently and together, would appear at the turn of the century. The course that drove pictorialism was set almost as soon as photographic processes were established, but it wasn't until the last decade of the 19th century that an international pictorialist movement came together.

==Defining pictorialism==

[[Image:Fading Away.jpg|thumb|left|"Fading Away", by [[Henry Peach Robinson]], 1858]]

In 1869 English photographer [[Henry Peach Robinson]] published a book entitled ''Pictorial Effect in Photography: Being Hints On Composition And Chiaroscuro For Photographers.''&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 1869&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first common use of the term "pictorial" referring to photography in the context of a certain stylistic element - [[chiaroscuro]] ‒ an Italian term used by painters and art historians that refers to the use of dramatic lighting and shading to convey an expressive mood. In his book Robinson promoted what he called "combination printing", a method he had devised nearly 20 years earlier by combining individual elements from separate images into a new single image by manipulating multiple negatives or prints. Robinson thus considered that he had created "art" through photography, since it was only through his direct intervention that the final image came about. Robinson continued to expand on the meaning of the term throughout his life.

Other photographers and art critics, including [[Oscar Rejlander]], [[Marcus Aurelius Root]], [[John Ruskin]], echoed these ideas. One of the primary forces behind the rise of pictorialism was the belief that [[straight photography]] was purely representational ‒ that it showed reality without the filter of artistic interpretation. It was for, all intents and purposes, a simple record of the visual facts, lacking artistic intent or merit.&lt;ref&gt;Bunnell, p 2&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson and others felt strongly that the "usually accepted limitations of photography had to be overcome if an equality of status was to be achieved.&lt;ref name="Harker, p 19"/&gt;

Robert Demachy later summarized this concept in an article entitled "What Difference Is There Between a Good Photograph and an Artistic Photograph?". He wrote "We must realize that, on undertaking pictorial photography, we have, unwittingly perhaps, bound ourselves to the strict observance of rules hundreds of years more ancient than the oldest formulae of our chemical craft. We have slipped into the Temple of Art by a back door, and found ourselves amongst the crowd of adepts."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Demachy, ''Camera Notes'', Vol 3, No 2, Oct 1899, pp 46. Reprinted in Padon, p 120&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the challenges in promoting photography as art was that there were many different opinions about how art should look. After the Third Philadelphia Salon 1900, which showcased dozens of pictorial photographers, one critic wondered "whether the idea of art in anything like the true sense had ever been heard or thought by the great majority of exhibitors."&lt;ref&gt;Sternberger, p 136&lt;/ref&gt;

While some photographers saw themselves becoming true artists by emulating painting, at least one school of painting directly inspired photographers. During the 1880s, when debates over art and photography were becoming commonplace, a style of painting known as [[Tonalism]] first appeared. Within a few years it became a significant artistic influence on the development of pictorialism.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p 3&lt;/ref&gt; Painters such as [[James McNeill Whistler]], [[George Inness]], [[Ralph Albert Blakelock]] and [[Arnold Böcklin]] saw the interpretation of the experience of nature, as contrasted with simply recording an image of nature, as the artist's highest duty. To these artists it was essential that their paintings convey an emotional response to the viewer, which was elicited through an emphasis on the atmospheric elements in the picture and by the use of "vague shapes and subdued tonalities&amp;nbsp;... [to convey] a sense of elegiac melancholy."&lt;ref name=WHP1&gt;Rosenblum, pp&amp;nbsp;297–299&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Stieglitz-SpringShowers.jpg|thumb|upright|"Spring Showers", by [[Alfred Stieglitz]], 1902]]

Applying this same sensibility to photography, [[Alfred Stieglitz]] later stated it this way: "Atmosphere is the medium through which we see all things. In order, therefore, to see them in their true value on a photograph, as we do in Nature, atmosphere must be there. Atmosphere softens all lines; it graduates the transition from light to shade; it is essential to the reproduction of the sense of distance. That dimness of outline which is characteristic for distant objects is due to atmosphere. Now, what atmosphere is to Nature, tone is to a picture."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Stieglitz, "A Plea for Art Photography in America." ''Photographic Mosaics,'' Vol 28, 1892. In Whelan, p 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul L. Anderson, a prolific contemporary promoter of pictorialism, advised his readers that true art photography conveyed "suggestion and mystery", in which "mystery consists in affording an opportunity for the exercise of the imagination, whereas suggestion involves stimulating the imagination by direct or indirect means."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1919), p 90&lt;/ref&gt; Science, pictorialists contended, might answer a demand for truthful information, but art must respond to the human need for stimulation of the senses.&lt;ref name=WHP1/&gt; This could only be done by creating a mark of individuality for each image and, ideally, each print.

For pictorialists, true individuality was expressed through the creation of a unique print, considered by many to be the epitome of artistic photography.&lt;ref name=WHP1/&gt; By manipulating the appearance of images through what some called "ennobling processes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Samuel|last=Morozov|date=October 1977|title=Early Photography in Eastern Europe - Russia|journal=History of Photography|volume=1|issue=4| page=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[gum bichromate|gum]] or [[Oil Print Process#Bromoil process|bromoil]] printing, pictorialists were able to create unique photographs that were sometimes mistaken for drawings or lithographs.

Many of the strongest voices that championed pictorialism at its beginning were a new generation of amateur photographers. In contrast to its meaning today, the word "amateur" held a different connotation in the discussions of that time. Rather than suggesting an inexperienced novice, the word characterized someone who strived for artistic excellence and a freedom from rigid academic influence.&lt;ref name=PCC4&gt;Wilson, p 4&lt;/ref&gt; An amateur was seen as someone who could break the rules because he or she was not bound by the then rigid rules set forth by long-established photography organizations like the [[Royal Photographic Society]]. An article in the British journal ''Amateur Photographer'' stated "photography is an art ‒ perhaps the only one in which the amateur soon equals, and frequently excels, the professional in proficiency."&lt;ref name=PCC4/&gt; This attitude prevailed in many countries around the world. At the 1893 Hamburg International Photographic Exhibition in Germany, only the work of amateurs was allowed. Alfred Lichtwark, then director of the [[Kunsthalle Hamburg]] believed "the only good portraiture in any medium was being done by amateurs photographers, who had the economic freedom and time to experiment."&lt;ref name=PCC4/&gt;

In 1948, [[S. D. Jouhar|S.D.Jouhar]] defined a Pictorial photograph as "mainly an aesthetic symbolic record of a scene ''plus'' the artist's personal comment and interpretation, capable of transmitting an emotional response to the mind of a receptive spectator. It should show originality, imagination, unity of purpose, a quality of repose, and have an infinite quality about it"&lt;ref&gt;Royal Photographic Society Journal, August 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years other names were given to pictorialism, including "art photography" and ''Camerawork'' (both by Alfred Stieglitz), "Impressionist photography" (by George Davision), "new vision (''Neue Vision''), and finally "subjective photography" (''Subjektive Fotographie'') in Germany after the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Bunnell, p 1&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain pictorial photographers were sometimes called "interventionists" (''intervencionistas''), although the style itself was not known as "interventionism".&lt;ref&gt;King, p 112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition into Modernism==

[[Image:Jane Reece-Spaces.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jane Reece (photographer)|Jane Reece]], ''Spaces'', 1922.]]

The evolution of pictorialism from the 19th century well into the 1940s was both slow and determined. From its roots in Europe it spread to the U.S. and the rest of the world in several semi-distinct stages. Prior to 1890 pictorialism emerged through advocates who were mainly in England, Germany, Austria and France. During the 1890s the center shifted to New York and Stieglitz's multi-faceted efforts. By 1900 pictorialism had reached countries around the world, and major exhibitions of pictorial photography were held in dozens of cities.

A culminating moment for pictorialism and for photography in general occurred in  1910, when the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery|Albright Gallery]] in Buffalo bought 15 photographs from Stieglitz' [[291 (art gallery)|291 Gallery]]. This was the first time photography was officially recognized as an art form worthy of a museum collection, and it signaled a definite shift in many photographers' thinking. Stieglitz, who had worked so long for this moment, responded by indicating he was already thinking of a new vision beyond pictorialism. He wrote, "It is high time that the stupidity and sham in pictorial photography be struck a solarplexus blow&amp;nbsp;... Claims of art won't do. Let the photographer make a perfect photograph. And if he happens to be a lover of perfection and a seer, the resulting photograph will be straight and beautiful - a true photograph."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DVD notes|title=American Masters - Alfred Stieglitz: The Eloquent Eye|origyear = 2001|others = Perry Miller Adato|type = DVD|publisher = Winstar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after Stieglitz began to direct his attention more to modern painting and sculpture, and Clarence H. White and others took over the leadership of a new generation of photographers. As the harsh realities of [[World War I]] affected people around the world, the public's taste for the art of the past began to change. Developed countries of the world focused on more and more in the industry and growth, and art reflected this change by featuring hard-edged images of new buildings, airplanes and industrial landscapes.

Pictorialism had, for the most part, run its course, but in the early part of the 21st century it is now more popular than ever {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}.  Adolf Fassbender, a 20th-century photographer who continued to make pictorial photographs well into the 1960s, believed that pictorialism is eternal because it is based upon beauty first. He wrote "There is no solution in trying to eradicate pictorialism for one would then have to destroy idealism, sentiment and all sense of art and beauty. There will always be pictorialism."&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, p 160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pictorialism by country==

===Australia===

One of the primary catalysts of pictorialism in Australia was [[John Kauffmann]] (1864–1942), who studied photographic chemistry and printing in London, Zurich and Vienna between 1889 and 1897. When he returned to his home country in 1897, he greatly influenced his colleagues by exhibiting what one newspaper called photographs that could be "mistaken for works of art."&lt;ref&gt;Gael Newton, "Australian Pictorial Photography: Seeing the Light", in Padon, pp&amp;nbsp;97–99&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next decade a core of photographer artists, including [[Harold Cazneaux]], [[Frank Hurley]], [[Cecil Bostock]], [[Henri Mallard]], [[Rose Simmonds]]&lt;ref name=queen&gt;[http://www.artmuseum.uq.edu.au/content/rose-simmonds-queensland-pictorial-photographer Rose Simmonds Queensland Pictorial Photographer], Art Museum Queensland, Retrieved 16 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Olive Cotton]], exhibited pictorial works at salons and exhibitions across the country and published their photos in the ''Australian Photographic Journal'' and the ''Australasian Photo-Review''.

===Austria===

In 1891 the Club der Amateur Photographen in Wien (Vienna Amateur Photographers' Club) held the first International Exhibition of Photography in Vienna. The Club, founded by Carl Sma, Federico Mallmann and Charles Scolik, was founded to foster relationships with photographic groups in other countries. After Alfred Buschbeck became head of the club in 1893, it simplified its name to Wiener Camera-Klub (Vienna Camera Club) and began publishing a lavish magazine called ''Wiener Photographische Blätter'' that continued until 1898. It regularly featured articles from influential foreign photographers such as [[Alfred Stieglitz]] and [[Robert Demachy]].&lt;ref name=VCC&gt;Manon Hübscher, "The Vienna Camera Club, Catalyst and Crucible", in Daum, pp&amp;nbsp;125–129&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other countries, opposing viewpoints engaged a wider range of photographers in defining what pictorialism meant. {{Interlanguage link multi|Hans Watzek|de|3=Hans Watzek (Fotograf)}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Hugo Henneberg|de}} and [[Heinrich Kühn]] formed an organization called Das Kleeblatt (The Trilfolium) expressly to increase the exchange of information with other organizations in other countries, especially, France, Germany and the United States. Initially a small, informal group, Das Kleeblatt increased it influence in the Wiener Camera-Klub through its international connections, and several other organizations promoting pictorialism were created in other cities throughout the region. As in other countries, interest in pictorialism faded after World War I, and eventually most of the Austrian organization slipped into obscurity during the 1920s.&lt;ref name=VCC/&gt;

===Canada===
[[File:Poster for Exhibition of Pictorial Photography.jpg|thumb|120px|1917 Exhibition Poster]]
Pictorialism in Canada initially centered on Sidney Carter (1880–1956), the first of his countrymen to be elected to the Photo-Secession. This inspired him to bring together a group of pictorial photographers in Toronto,  the Studio Club in Toronto, with [[Harold Mortimer-Lamb]] (1872–1970) and fellow Secessionist Percy Hodgins.&lt;ref&gt;Kolton, pp 4‒11&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 Carter organized Canada's first major exhibition of pictorial photography at Montreal's Art Association. Carter and fellow photographer [[Arthur Goss]] attempted to introduce pictorialist principles to the members of the [[Toronto Camera Club]], although their efforts were met with some resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Kolton, p 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===

As early as 1853 amateur photographer William J. Newton proposed the idea that "a  'natural object', such as a tree, should be photographed in accordance 'the acknowledged principles of fine art'".&lt;ref name=Liddy&gt;Brian Liddy, "The Origins and Development of Pictorial Photography in Britain." In Daum, pp 65‒71&lt;/ref&gt; From there other early photographers, including [[Henry Peach Robinson]] and [[Peter Henry Emerson]], continued to promote the concept of photography as art. In 1892 Robinson, along with [[George Davison (photographer)|George Davison]] and [[Alfred Maskell]], established the first organization devoted specifically to the ideal of photography as art ‒ The Linked Ring. They invited like-minded photographers, including [[Frank Sutcliffe]], [[Frederick H. Evans]], [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]], [[Frederick Hollyer]], [[James Craig Annan]], [[Alfred Horsley Hinton]] and others, to join them. Soon The Linked Ring was at the forefront of the movement to have photography regarded as an art form.

After The Linked Ring invited a select group of Americans as members, debates broke out about the goals and purpose of the club. When more American than British members were shown at their annual exhibit in 1908, a motion was introduced to disband the organization. By 1910 The Linked Ring has dissolved, and its members went their own way.

===France===

Pictorialism in France is dominated by two names, [[Constant Puyo]] and [[Robert Demachy]]. They are the most famous members of the Photo-Club de Paris, a separate organization from the [[Société française de photographie]]. They are particularly well known for their use of pigment processes, especially [[gum bichromate]].&lt;ref&gt;Julien Faure-Conorton, ''Characterization, contextualization and reception of Robert Demachy’s photographic work (1859-1936)'' (Ph.D. Thesis - in French), Paris, EHESS, 2015, 1136 p.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, they published a book on the subject, ''Les Procédés d'art en Photographie''. Both of them also wrote many articles for the ''Bulletin du Photo-Club de Paris'' (1891-1902) and ''La Revue de Photographie'' (1903-1908), a magazine which quickly became the most influential French publication dealing with artistic photography during the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Poivert, "An Avant-Garde without Combat: The French Anti-Modernists and the Pre-Modernism of the American Photo-Secession." In Daum, pp&amp;nbsp;31–35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===

The brothers Theodor and Oskar Hofmeister of Hamburg were among the first to advocate for photography as art in their country. At meetings of the Society for the Promotion of Amateur Photography (Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Amateur-Photographie), other photographers, including Heinrich Beck, George Einbeck, and Otto Scharf, advanced the cause of pictorialism. The Homeisters, along with [[Heinrich Kühn]], later formed The Presidium (Das Praesidium), whose members  were instrumental in major exhibitions at the Kunsthalle in Hamburg. Nowadays [[Karl Maria Udo Remmes]] represents the style of pictorialism in the field of theatrical backstage photography.

===Japan===

In 1889 photographers [[Ogawa Kazumasa]], [[W. K. Burton]], [[Kajima Seibei]] and several others formed the Nihon Shashin-kai ([[Japan Photographic Society (19th century)|Japan Photographic Society]]) in order to promote ''geijutsu shashin'' (art photography) in that country. Acceptance of this new style was slow at first, but in 1893 Burton coordinated a major invitational exhibition known as ''Gaikoku Shashin-ga Tenrain-kai'' or the ''Foreign Photographic Art Exhibition''.&lt;ref name=PPJ&gt;Ryūichi Kaneko, "Pictorial Photography in Japan." In Padon, pp&amp;nbsp;81–84&lt;/ref&gt; The 296 works that were shown came from members of the London Camera Club, including important photographs by [[Peter Henry Emerson]] and [[George Davison (photographer)|George Davison]]. The breadth and depth of this exhibition had a tremendous impact on Japanese photographers, and it "galvanized the discourse of art photography throughout the country."&lt;ref name=PPJ/&gt; After the exhibition ended Burton and Kajima founded a new organization, the Dai Nihon Shashin Hinpyō-kai (Greater Japan Photography Critique Society) to advance their particular viewpoints on art photography.

In 1904 a new magazine called ''Shashin Geppo'' (''Monthly Photo Journal'') was started, and for many years it was the centerpiece for the advancement of and debates about pictorialism. The meaning and direction of art photography as championed by Ogawa and others was challenged in the new journal by photographers Tarō Saitō and Haruki Egashira, who, along with Tetsusuke Akiyama and Seiichi Katō, formed a new group known as Yūtsuzu-sha. This new group promoted their own concepts of what they called "the inner truth" of art photography.&lt;ref name=PPJ/&gt; For the next decade many photographers aligned themselves with one of these two organizations.

In the 1920s new organizations were formed that bridged the transition between pictorialism and modernism. Most prominently among these was the Shashin Geijustu-sha (Photographic Art Society) formed by [[Shinzō Fukuhara]] and his brother [[Rosō Fukuhara]]. They promoted the concept of ''hikari to sono kaichō'' (light with its harmony) that rejected an overt manipulation of an image in favor of soft-focused images using silver gelatin printing.&lt;ref name=PPJ/&gt;

===Netherlands===

The first generation of Dutch pictorialists, including Bram Loman, Chris Schuver and Carl Emile Mögle, began working around 1890. They initially focused on naturalistic themes and favored platinum printing. Although initially there was no Dutch equivalent of The Linked Ring or Photo-Secession,  several smaller organizations collaborated to produce the First International Salon for Art Photography in 1904. Three years later Adriann Boer, Ernest Loeb, Johan Huijsen and others founded the Dutch Club for Art Photography (Nederlandsche Club voor Foto-Kunst), which amassed an important collection of pictorial photography now housed at [[Leiden University]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingeborg Th. Leijerzapf, "Pictorialism in The Netherlands." In Daum, pp 139‒147&lt;/ref&gt; A second generation of Dutch pictorialists included Henri Berssenbrugge, Bernard Eilers and Berend Zweers.

===Russia===

Pictorialism spread to Russia first through European magazines and was championed by photography pioneers Evgeny Vishnyakov in Russia and [[Jan Bulhak]] from Poland. Soon after a new generation of pictorialists became active. These included Aleksei Mazuin, Sergei Lobovikov, Piotr Klepikov, Vassily Ulitin, [[Nikolay Andreyev (photographer)|Nikolay Andreyev]], Nikolai Svishchov-Paola, Leonid Shokin and Alexander Grinberg. In 1894 the Russian Photographic Society was established in Moscow, but differences of opinion among the members led to the establishment of a second organization, the Moscow Society of Art Photography. Both were the primary promoters of pictorialsim in Russia for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photographer.ru/cult/history/472.htm|title=Edtudes for the History of Russian Pictorlialism|first=Irina|last=Tchmyreva|accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quiet Resistance: Russian Pictorialism of the 1900s‒1930s|first=Olga|last=Sviblova|publisher=Moscoe: Multimedia Complex of Actual Arts|year=2005|pages=182–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===

The main centers of pictorial photography in Spain were Madrid and Barcelona. Leading the movement in Madrid was Antonio Cánovas, who founded the Real Sociedad Fotográfica de Madrid and edited the magazine ''La Fotografía''. Cánovas claimed to be the first to introduce artistic photography to Spain, but throughout his career he remained rooted in the allegorical style of the early English pictorialists like Robinson. He refused to use any surface manipulation in his prints, saying that style "is not, cannot be and will never be photography.".&lt;ref&gt;King, p 133&lt;/ref&gt; Other influential photographers in the country were Carlos Iñigo, Manual Renon, Joan Vilatobà and a person known only as the Conde de la Ventosa. Unlike the rest of Europe, pictorialism remained popular in Spain throughout the 1920s and 1930s, and Ventosa was the most prolific pictorialist of that period. Unfortunately very few original prints remain from any of these photographers; most of their images are now known only from magazine reproductions.&lt;ref&gt;King, p 125&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

One of the key figures in establishing both the definition and direction of pictorialism was American [[Alfred Stieglitz]], who began as an amateur but quickly made the promotion of pictorialism his profession and obsession. Through his writings, his organizing and his personal efforts to advance and promote pictorial photographers, Stieglitz was a dominant figure in pictorialism from its beginnings to its end. Following in the footsteps of German photographers, in 1892 Stieglitz established a group he called the [[Photo-Secession]] in New York. Stieglitz hand-picked the members of the group, and he tightly controlled what it did and when it did it. By selecting photographers whose vision was aligned with his, including [[Gertrude Käsebier]], [[Eva Watson-Schütze]], [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]], [[Edward Steichen]], and [[Joseph Keiley]], Stieglitz built a circle of friends who had enormous individual and collective influence over the movement to have photography accepted as art. Stieglitz also continually promoted pictorialism through two publications he edited, [[Camera Notes]] and [[Camera Work]] and by establishing and running a gallery in New York that for many years exhibited only pictorial photographers (the [[Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession]]).&lt;ref&gt;Doty, pp&amp;nbsp;5–10&lt;/ref&gt;

While much initially centered on Stieglitz, pictorialism in the U.S. was not limited to New York. In Boston [[F. Holland Day]] was one of the most prolific and noted pictorialists of his time. [[Clarence Hudson White|Clarence H. White]], who produced extraordinary pictorial photographs while in Ohio, went on to teach a whole new generation of photographers. On the West Coast the California Camera Club and Southern California Camera Club included prominent pictorialists [[Annie Brigman]], [[Arnold Genthe]],  [[Adelaide Hanscom Leeson]], Emily Pitchford and William E. Dassonville.&lt;ref&gt;McCarroll, pp 15‒30&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, the [[Seattle Camera Club]] was started by a group of Japanese-American pictorialists, including Dr. Kyo Koike, Frank Asakichi Kunishige and Iwao Matsushita (prominent members later included [[Ella E. McBride]] and [[Soichi Sunami]]).&lt;ref&gt;Martin, pp&amp;nbsp;10–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Pictorial photographers began by taking an ordinary glass-plate or film negative. Some adjusted the focus of the scene or used a special lens to produce a softer image, but for the most part the printing process controlled the final appearance of the photograph. Pictorialists used a variety of papers and chemical processes to produce particular effects, and some then manipulated the tones and surface of prints with brushes, ink or pigments. The following is a list of the most commonly used pictorial processes. More details about these processes may be found in Crawford (pp 85‒95) and in Daum (pp 332‒334). Unless otherwise noted, the descriptions below are summarized from these two books.

*[[Oil Print Process#Bromoil process|Bromoil process]]: This is a variant on the oil print process that allows a print to be enlarged. In this process a regular silver gelatin print is made, then bleached in a solution of potassium bichromate. This hardens the surface of the print and allows ink to stick to it. Both the lighter and darker areas of a bromoil print may be manipulated, providing a broader tonal range than an oil print.
*[[Carbon print]]: This is an extremely delicate print made by coating tissue paper with potassium bichromate, [[carbon black]] or another pigment and gelatin. Carbon prints can provide extraordinary detail and are among the most permanent of all photographic prints. Due to the stability of the paper both before and after processing, carbon printing tissue was one of the earliest commercially made photographic products.
*[[Cyanotype]]: One of the earliest photographic processes, cyanotypes experienced a brief renewal when pictorialists experimented with their deep blue color tones. The color came from coating paper with light-sensitive iron salts.
*[[Gum bichromate]]: One of the pictorialists' favorites, these prints were made by applying [[gum Arabic]], [[potassium bichromate]] and one or more artist's colored pigments to paper. This sensitized solution slowly hardens where light strikes it, and these areas remain pliable for several hours. The photographer had a great deal of control by varying the mixture of the solution, allowing a shorter or longer exposure and by brushing or rubbing the pigmented areas after exposure.
*[[Oil Print Process]]: Made by applying greasy inks to paper coated with a solution of gum bichromate and gelatin. When exposed through a negative, the gum-gelatin hardens where light strikes it while unexposed areas remain soft. Artist's inks are then applied by brush, and the inks adhere only to the hardened areas. Through this process a photographer can manipulate the lighter areas of a gum print while the darker areas remain stable. An oil print cannot be enlarged since it has to be in direct contact with the negative.
*[[Platinum print]]: Platinum prints require a two-steps process. First, paper is sensitized with iron salts and exposed in contact with a negative until a faint image is formed. Then the paper is chemically developed in a process that replaces the iron salts with platinum. This produces an image with a very wide range of tones, each intensely realized.

==Pictorial photographers==

Following are two lists of prominent photographers who engaged in pictorialism during their careers. The first list includes photographers who were predominantly pictorialists for all or almost all of their careers (generally those active from 1880 to 1920). The second list includes 20th-century photographers who used a pictorial style early in the careers but who are more well known for pure or [[straight photography]].

'''Reciprocating motion''', also called '''reciprocation''', is a repetitive up-and-down or back-and-forth linear [[motion (physics)|motion]]. It is found in a wide range of mechanisms, including [[reciprocating engine]]s and [[pump]]s. The two opposite motions that comprise a single reciprocation cycle are called [[stroke (engine)|stroke]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

A [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] can be used to convert [[circular motion]] into reciprocating motion, or conversely turn reciprocating motion into circular motion.

For example, inside an [[internal combustion engine]] (a type of reciprocating engine),  the expansion of burning fuel in the [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]]s periodically pushes the [[piston]] down, which, through the [[connecting rod]], turns the [[crankshaft]]. The continuing rotation of the crankshaft drives the piston back up, ready for the next cycle. The piston moves in a reciprocating motion, which is converted into circular motion of the crankshaft, which ultimately propels the vehicle or does other useful work.

Reciprocating motion is close to, but different from, [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] [[simple harmonic motion]]. The point on the crankshaft which connects to the connecting rod, rotates smoothly at a constant velocity in a circle. Thus, the horizontal displacement, of that point, is indeed  exactly sinusoidal by definition.  However, during the cycle, the angle of the connecting rod changes continuously. So, the horizontal displacement of the "far" end of the connecting rod (i.e., connected to the piston) differs from sinusoidal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5828">"'''Reform of Architects Registration'''"&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.aaruk.info/board01/DOE%20Consultation.pdf Copy of consultation paper]&lt;/ref&gt; was the title of a UK government consultation paper dated 19 July 1994 which was issued by the [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Department of the Environment]].  The introduction stated that in October 1993 the Government had announced that the profession and others would be consulted about measures which could be taken to simplify the then arrangements for the registration of architects under the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects Registration Acts]], and that broad agreement on what those measures would be had been reached with the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] (ARCUK) and the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA).  Eventually, Parliament made certain changes to the Architects Registration Acts which now have effect under the [[Architects Act 1997]].

The consultation paper went on to state that the current proposals for reform stemmed from a request from ARCUK to [[UK Government|the Government]] in 1992 that the Architects Registration Acts should be reviewed; and that a review had been carried out by Mr E J D Warne CB, whose report had been published by [[HMSO]] in 1993.

The consultation paper mentioned that the [[Warne Report]] had considered the views of architects, architectural bodies and consumers and "agreed with ARCUK" that there were certain weaknesses of its structure: and that the reforms being proposed were aimed at overcoming those weaknesses in a way that would be generally acceptable to the profession and public alike.

The main objective of the reforms was stated to be:
: ''to create a small, focussed and effective registration body which represents the interests of both the profession and the general public'',

:::and its purpose would be to
: ''set criteria for admission to the Register; prevent misuse of the title '[[architect]]'; discipline unprofessional conduct, and set fee levels.''

The [[punctuation]] in the document, as reproduced above, seemed to indicate a close connection of some kind between setting fee levels and professional conduct.  But in the event the setting of fee levels was later abandoned, while, in respect of professional conduct, statutory powers to inflict fines expressly on a par with criminal penalties were given to a body which would have persons who are not themselves members of the profession in the decisive majority, and who would not be acting under the judicial oath of a [[judge]] or a [[magistrate]] in a court of criminal or civil jurisdiction, or pursuant to the [[consensual]] [[jurisdiction]] of an [[arbitrator]], and would not necessarily have the appropriate skill and knowledge to be able to act competently and fairly in respect of hazarding an architect's professional reputation.  This could have been seen as an objectionable aberration, but that instead a preponderance of political opinion welcomed such an arrangement, regarding it as a pioneering development, may be explained at least in part by observing that the usage "[[wikt:stakeholder|stakeholders]]"&lt;ref&gt; Freeman, R. Edward (1984). Strategic Management: A stakeholder approach. Boston: Pitman. {{ISBN|0-273-01913-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; had gained some currency at the time.

Certain issues had been the background to the [[Warne Report]] as matters were in the 1990s and had always been, namely, issues concerning the flaws or merits of the case for or against such proposals in theory or in principle or in relation particularly, on the one hand, to the [[Register of Architects]], to restrictions on the use of the word "architect", and to the practice of architecture considered as an art or as a business or as a means of earning a livelihood; and on the other hand, to official accountability, juridical norms and the rule of law: see further, article on [[Architects Registration in the United Kingdom]] - background to legislation.

One of the proposals mentioned in the consultation document which were later enacted and are now operative was that ARCUK would remain as a legal entity, but its name would be changed to "[[Architects Registration Board]]"; and it was stated that although this change, in itself, would have no impact on the status or role of ARCUK it would suggest a smaller, tighter body and would mark the alterations to ARCUK's functions.

Another of the proposals was that there should be an office of Registrar whose functions would be to maintain the Register and carry out the instructions of the Board; and it was stated that the Registrar would be a named appointee of the Board which would decide whether the Registrar should be an employee or a contractor.

'''Ruth Westheimer''' (born June 4, 1928), better known as '''Dr. Ruth''', is a [[Germany|German]]-born, Jewish immigrant to the United States who became a fixture in late-night television and a major pop culture figure as a [[sex therapy|sex therapist]], media personality, and author. Her media career began in 1980 with the radio show, ''Sexually Speaking'', which continued until 1990. She also hosted at least five television shows on the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] and other [[cable television]] from 1984 to 1993. She is also the author of approximately 40 [[book]]s on a variety of topics about [[sex]] and [[sexuality]].

==Early life and education==
Westheimer was born Karola Ruth Siegel on June 4, 1928, in [[Wiesenfeld (Karlstadt)|Wiesenfeld]] (near [[Karlstadt am Main]]), [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], the only child of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] Irma (née Hanauer), a housekeeper and Julius Siegel, a notions wholesaler and son of the family for whom Irma worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/westheimer-ruth|title=Ruth Westheimer|publisher=JWA.org|date=March 1, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was given an early grounding in [[Judaism]] by her father, who took her regularly to the synagogue in [[Frankfurt]], where they lived. In January 1939, she was sent to an orphanage in [[Switzerland]] by her mother and grandmother as part of the ''[[Kindertransport]]'' after her father had been taken by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]].&lt;ref name="snopes-sniper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GAH"&gt;{{cite web|title=German-American Corner: Ruth Westheimer|url=http://www.germanheritage.com/biographies/mtoz/westheimer.html|website=www.germanheritage.com|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Dullea, Georgia.

October 26, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; She stopped receiving her parents' letters in September 1941. In 1945, Westheimer learned that her parents had been killed in [[the Holocaust]], possibly at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].&lt;ref name=GAH/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=HollywoodReporter-Survivors-2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flax|first1=Peter|last2=Baum|first2=Gary|last3=Roxborough|first3=Scott|last4=Guthrie|first4=Marisa|last5=Lewis|first5=Andy|title=Hollywood's Last Survivors of the Holocaust share their stories|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/holocaust-survivors/dr_ruth_westheimer/|accessdate=December 16, 2015|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Westheimer decided to emigrate to British-controlled [[Mandatory Palestine]]. There, at 17, she "first had sexual intercourse on a starry night, in a haystack, without contraception." She later told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "I am not happy about that, but I know much better now and so does everyone who listens to my radio program."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Westheimer joined the [[Haganah]] in [[Jerusalem]]. Because of her diminutive height of {{height|ft=4|in=7|abbr=MOS}},&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; she was trained as a [[Reconnaissance|scout]] and [[sniper]].&lt;ref name="snopes-sniper"&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/medical/doctor/drruth.asp Urban Legends Reference Pages: Dr. Ruth Was a Sniper] by Barbara Mikkelson, March 1, 2007, Retrieved March 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Of this experience, she said, "I never killed anybody, but I know how to throw hand grenades and shoot."&lt;ref name="2013_usatoday"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jayson|first1=Sharon|title=Dr. Ruth, pushing age 85, still talking about sex.|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/15/dr-ruth-westheimer-sex/2162073/|accessdate=March 25, 2017|publisher=''USA Today''|date=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Westheimer was seriously wounded in action by an exploding [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] during the [[Israeli War of Independence]] in 1948, and it was several months before she was able to walk again.&lt;ref name=GAH/&gt;&lt;ref name="NatGeo"&gt;Foreman, Tom (June 11, 2003).

==Early career==

After receiving her Ed.D., she briefly worked for [[Planned Parenthood]] and this experience encouraged her to continue studying [[human sexuality]]. She went on to work as a [[postdoctoral researcher]] for [[Helen Singer Kaplan]] at [[New York-Presbyterian Hospital]].&lt;ref name=GAH/&gt; She continued to work there as an Adjunct Associate Professor for five years.

==Media career==
Dr. Ruth's media career began in 1980 when her radio show, ''Sexually Speaking'', debuted on [[WQHT#WYNY|WYNY-FM]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="Sterling"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sterling|first1=Christopher H.|title=Biographical Encyclopedia of American Radio|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-415-99549-8|page=423|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mdQq-663faAC&amp;pg=PA423&amp;lpg=PA423&amp;dq=dr.+ruth+WYNY+1980#v=onepage&amp;q=dr.%20ruth%20WYNY%201980&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was offered this opportunity after she gave a lecture to New York broadcasters about the need for [[sex education]] programming to help deal with issues of [[contraception]] and unwanted pregnancies. Betty Elam, the community affairs manager at WYNY, was impressed with her talk and offered Westheimer [[United States dollar|$]]25 per week to make ''Sexually Speaking'', which started as a 15-minute show airing every Sunday at midnight.&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff Writers|title=Dr. Ruth Westheimer Biography.|url=http://www.biography.com/people/dr-ruth-westheimer-9542073|website=Biography.com|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1983, her show was the top-rated radio show in the area, and in 1984, [[NBC Radio]] began [[Broadcast syndication|syndicating]] it nationwide, renaming the show to the ''Dr. Ruth Show''.

In 1984, Westheimer began hosting several television programs on the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] TV network and one in syndication. Her first show was ''Good Sex! With Dr. Ruth Westheimer'', airing for a half hour at 10&amp;nbsp;pm on weeknights. This show was expanded in 1985 to a full hour and its name was changed to ''The Dr. Ruth Show''. In 1987, she began a separate half hour syndicated series on many broadcast stations called, ''Ask Dr. Ruth'', which was co-hosted by Larry Angelo. Dr. Ruth returned to the Lifetime network in 1988 with ''The All New Dr. Ruth Show'', which was followed in 1989 by two teen advice shows called ''What's Up, Dr. Ruth?'' and a call-in show, ''You're on the Air with Dr. Ruth'' in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooks|first1=Tim|last2=Marsh|first2=Earle F.|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present|date=2007|publisher=Ballentine Books|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-345-49773-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=w8KztFy6QYwC&amp;pg=PA373&amp;dq=dr.+ruth+lifetime+tv+show#v=onepage&amp;q=dr.%20ruth%20lifetime%20tv%20show&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Westheimer and Israeli TV host, Arad Nir, hosted a talk show in Hebrew, titled ''Min Tochnit'', on the newly opened Israeli Channel 2. The show was similar to her US ''Sexually Speaking'' show. The name of the show, ''Min Tochnit'', is a play of words: literally "Kind of a program", but "Min" (מין) in Hebrew also means "[[sex]]" and "[[gender]]".&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Min Tochnit|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332951/|website=IMDB|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, "Dr. Ruth", became a household name and she made guest appearances on several [[network television]] shows, including ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''.&lt;ref name="Wolf"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolf|first1=Michelle Andrea|last2=Kielwasser, Aldred P.|title=Gay People, Sex, and the Media|date=1991|publisher=The Haworth Press|location=New York City; London|isbn=0-86656-936-7|page=142|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y_Hd0F2J7LEC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=david+letterman+westheimer#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20letterman%20westheimer&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also made frequent appearances on the syndicated revival of ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' that ran from 1986 to 1989. In the 1990s, Westheimer appeared as herself in [[Quantum Leap (season 5)|episode 89]] of ''[[Quantum Leap (TV series)|Quantum Leap]]'', the episode title being "Dr. Ruth". She appeared on [[Tom Chapin]]'s album ''This Pretty Planet'', in the song "Two Kinds of Seagulls", in which she and Chapin sing of various animals that reproduce sexually.  "It takes two to tingle", says the song. Dr. Ruth also appeared in several commercial advertisements, including a 1994 [[Honda Prelude]] ad, and an ad for [[Clairol]] [[Herbal Essences]] [[shampoo]] and body wash.&lt;ref name="prelude"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dr. Ruth pilots Prelude ad.|journal=''Advertising Age''|date=October 1994|volume=65|issue=42|page=45|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9410190935/dr-ruth-pilots-prelude-ad|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="clairol"&gt;{{cite web|title=Clairol Herbal Essences - Dr. Ruth (1990)|url=http://www.retrojunk.com/commercial/show/1653/clairol-herbal-essences-dr-ruth|website=www.retrojunk.com|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2001 and 2007, Westheimer made regular appearances on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] Television children's show ''[[Between the Lions]]'' as "Dr. Ruth Wordheimer" in a parody of her therapist role, in which she helps anxious readers and spellers overcome their fear of long words. In the January 2009, the 55th anniversary issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine includes Westheimer as #13 in the list of the 55 most important people in sex from the past 55 years.&lt;ref name="Geller"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geller|first1=Adam|title=At 84, legendary sex therapist Dr. Ruth still has lots to talk about.|url=http://www.masslive.com/living/index.ssf/2012/07/post_134.html|accessdate=March 25, 2017|publisher=''Masslive''|date=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, the play, ''Becoming Dr. Ruth'' opened Off Broadway. Actress [[Debra Jo Rupp]] played the role of Dr. Ruth.

Westheimer has delivered [[commencement speech]]es at the [[Hebrew Union College]] [[seminary]], [[Lehman College]] of the [[City University of New York]], and, in 2004, at [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]], where she has been awarded [[honorary degree]]s.&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Jane|title=WORTH NOTING; Calling Dr. Ruth (To Speak at Trinity).|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/09/nyregion/worth-noting-calling-dr-ruth-to-speak-at-trinity.html?_r=0|accessdate=March 25, 2017|publisher=''New York Times''|date=May 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dr_ruth_dot_com"/&gt; She also taught courses and seminars at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Yale University|Yale]],&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt; and was the guest speaker at the [[Bronx High School of Science]] in New York in commemoration of [[Yom HaShoah]] 2008.

At the ceremony she received an honorary Bronx High School of Science diploma. In 2002, she received the [[Leo Baeck Institute|Leo Baeck Medal]] for her humanitarian work promoting tolerance and [[social justice]].&lt;ref name="dr_ruth_dot_com"/&gt;

==Personal life==

Westheimer has been married three times.&lt;ref name="NatGeo" /&gt; She said that each of her marriages played an important role in her relationship advice, but after two divorces, it was her third marriage, to Manfred Westheimer, that was the "real marriage".&lt;ref name="2013_usatoday"/&gt; This lasted until his death in 1997.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20948">'''Scientific literacy''' or '''Science literacy''' encompasses [[scientific writing|written]], [[mathematics|numerical]], and [[information technology|digital]] [[literacy]]  as they pertain to understanding [[science]], its [[scientific method|methodology]], [[observation]]s, and [[scientific theory|theories]].

== Definition ==

The OECD PISA Framework (2015) defines scientific literacy as "the ability to engage with science-related issues, and with the ideas of science, as a reflective citizen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.oecd.org/callsfortenders/Annex%20IA_%20PISA%202015%20Science%20Framework%20.pdf |title=PISA 2015 Science Framework |date=March 2013 |publisher=OECD |accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scientifically literate person, therefore, is willing to engage in reasoned discourse about science 
and technology which requires the competencies to:
* Explain phenomena scientifically &amp;ndash; recognize, offer and evaluate explanations for a range of natural and technological phenomena.
* Evaluate and design scientific inquiry &amp;ndash; describe and appraise scientific investigations and propose ways of addressing questions scientifically.
* Interpret data and evidence scientifically &amp;ndash; analyze and evaluate data, claims and arguments in a variety of representations and draw appropriate scientific conclusions.

According to the United States National Center for Education Statistics, "scientific literacy is the knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts and processes required for personal decision making, participation in civic and cultural affairs, and economic productivity".&lt;ref name=NCES&gt;{{harvnb|NAS|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scientifically literate person is defined as one who has the capacity to:

* Understand, [[experiment]], and [[reason]] as well as interpret scientific facts and their meaning.
* Ask, find, or determine answers to questions derived from curiosity about everyday experiences.
* Describe, explain, and predict [[natural phenomena]].
* Read articles with understanding of science in the [[popular press]] and engage in social conversation about the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the conclusions.
* Identify scientific issues underlying national and local decisions and express positions that are scientifically and technologically informed.
* Evaluate the quality of scientific information on the basis of its source and the methods used to generate it.
* Pose and evaluate [[arguments]] based on evidence and to apply conclusions from such arguments appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NAS|1996|loc=page 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scientific literacy may also be defined in language similar to the definitions of [[ocean literacy]],&lt;ref name = OL&gt;{{harvnb|OLN|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Earth science literacy]]&lt;ref name=ESL&gt;{{harvnb|ESLI|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Climate Literacy]].&lt;ref name=CL&gt;{{harvnb|CLN|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus a scientifically literate person can:
* Understand the science relevant to environmental and social issues.
* Communicate clearly about the science.
* Make informed decisions about these issues.

Finally, scientific literacy may involve particular attitudes toward learning and using science. A scientifically-literate citizen is capable of researching matters of fact for him or herself.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYHQcXVp4F4 Noam Chomsky on what it means to be educated]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Reforms in [[science education]] in the United States have often been driven by strategic challenges such as the launch of the [[Sputnik program|Sputnik satellite]] in 1957 and the [[Japanese economic miracle|Japanese economic boom]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rutherford|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, scientific literacy is now taken to mean that everyone should have a working knowledge of science and its role in society. Science literacy is seen as a right of every person and a requirement for [[Citizenship|responsible members of society]], one that helps average people to make better decisions and enrich their lives. The shift occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the publication of ''Science for All Americans''&lt;ref name=Rutherford1991&gt;{{harvnb|Rutherford |Ahlgren |1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Benchmarks for Science Literacy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | American Association for the Advancement of Science |1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial definitions of science literacy included elaborations of the actual content that people should understand, and this content often followed somewhat traditional lines ([[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]]). [[Earth science]] was somewhat narrowly defined as expanded geological processes. In the decade after those initial documents, ocean scientists and educators revised the notion of science literacy to include more contemporary, systems-oriented views of the natural world, leading to scientific literacy programs for the [[ocean]], [[climate]], [[earth science]], and so on. This shift has ensured that educators' views of science literacy stay in sync with the directions and advances of real science in the real world.

==Science, society, and the environment ==
The interdependence of humans and our natural environment is at the heart of scientific literacy in the Earth systems. As defined by nationwide consensus among scientists and educators, this literacy has two key parts. First, a literate person is defined, in language that echoes the above definition of scientific literacy. Second, a set of concepts are listed, organized into six to nine big ideas or essential principles. This defining process was undertaken first for [[ocean literacy]],&lt;ref name = OL&gt;{{harvnb|OLN|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; then for the [[Great Lakes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|OSGCP|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estuary|estuaries]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NOAA|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[atmosphere]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UCAR|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and climate.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;{{harvnb|CLN|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Earth science literacy]]&lt;ref name=ESL&gt;{{harvnb|ESLI|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the types of literacy defined for Earth systems; the qualities of an Earth science literate person are representative of the qualities for all the Earth system literacy definitions.

According to the Earth Science Literacy Initiative, an Earth-science-literate person:
* understands the fundamental concepts of Earth’s many systems
* knows how to find and assess scientifically credible information about Earth
* communicates about Earth science in a meaningful way
* is able to make informed and responsible decisions regarding Earth and its resources&lt;ref name=ESL/&gt;

All types of literacy in Earth systems have a definition like the above. Ocean literacy is further defined as "understanding our impact on the ocean and the ocean's impact on us".&lt;ref name=OL/&gt;
Similarly, the climate literacy website includes a guiding principle for decision making; "humans can take action to reduce climate change and its impacts".&lt;ref name=CL/&gt; Each type of Earth systems literacy then defines the concepts students should understand upon graduation from high school. Current educational efforts in Earth systems literacy tend to focus more on the scientific concepts than on the decision-making aspect of literacy, but environmental action remains as a stated goal.

The theme of science in a socially-relevant context appears in many discussions of scientific literacy. Ideas that turn up in the life sciences include an allusion to [[ecological literacy]], the "well-being of earth". Robin Wright, a writer for ''Cell Biology Education'', laments "will [undergraduates'] misunderstandings or lack of knowledge about science imperil our democratic way of life and national security?"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A discussion of physics literacy includes [[energy conservation]], [[ozone depletion]] and [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobson|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The mission statement of the Chemistry Literacy Project &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CLP|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes environmental and social justice.
Technological literacy is defined in a three-dimensional coordinate space; on the knowledge axis, it is noted that technology can be risky, and that it "reflects the values and culture of society".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gamire|Pearson|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Energy Literacy boasts several websites, including one associated with climate literacy&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;
and two advocacy organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ELA|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ELP|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudes as part of scientific literacy==
Attitudes about science can have a significant effect on scientific literacy. In [[education theory]], understanding of content lies in the cognitive domain, while attitudes lie in the affective domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Engelhart|Furst|Hill|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, negative attitudes, such as fear of science, can act as an [[affective filter]] and an impediment to comprehension and future learning goals. Studies of college students' attitudes about learning physics suggest that these attitudes may be divided into categories of real world connections, personal connections, conceptual connections, student effort and problem-solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|Perkins|Podolefsky|Dubson|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision-making aspect of science literacy suggests further attitudes about the state of the world, one's responsibility for its well-being and one's sense of empowerment to make a difference. These attitudes may be important measures of science literacy, as described in the case of [[ocean literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cudaback|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promoting and measuring==
Proponents of scientific literacy tend to focus on what is learned by the time a student graduates from high school. Science literacy has always been an important element of the standards movement in education. All science literacy documents have been drafted with the explicit intent of influencing educational standards, as a means to drive curriculum, teaching, assessment, and ultimately, learning nationwide.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Programs to promote scientific literacy among students abound, including several programs sponsored by technology companies, as well as quiz bowls and science fairs. A partial list of such programs includes the [[Global Challenge Award]], the [[National Ocean Sciences Bowl]] and Action Bioscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|AIBS|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations have attempted to compare the scientific literacy of adults in different countries.  The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] found that scientific literacy in the United States is not measurably different from the OECD average.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NCES|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science News reports "The new U.S. rate, based on questionnaires administered in 2008, is seven percentage points behind Sweden, the only European nation to exceed the Americans.  The U.S. figure is slightly higher than that for Denmark, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands. And it’s double the 2005 rate in the United Kingdom (and the collective rate for the European Union)." &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Science News|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

University educators are attempting to develop reliable instruments to measure scientific literacy, and the use of [[Concept inventory|concept inventories]] is increasing in the fields of physics, astronomy, chemistry, biology&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Klymkowsky|Underwood|Garvin-Doxas|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and earth science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wikispaces|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Libarkin|Ward|Andwerson|Kortemeyer|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexology''' is the scientific study of [[human sexuality]], including human sexual interests, [[Human sexual activity|behavior]]s and functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sexology|title=Sexology|work=Merriam Webster|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''sexology'' does not generally refer to the non-scientific study of sexuality, such as [[political science]] or [[social criticism]].&lt;ref name =Bullough1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haeberle/&gt;

Sexologists apply tools from several academic fields, such as [[biology]], [[medicine]], [[psychology]], [[epidemiology]], [[sociology]], and [[criminology]]. Topics of study include [[sexual development]] (puberty), [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[sexual relationship]]s, sexual activities, [[paraphilia]]s, atypical sexual interests.  It also includes the study of sexuality across the lifespan, including [[child sexuality]], [[puberty]], [[adolescent sexuality]], and [[geriatric sexology|sexuality among the elderly]]. Sexology also spans sexuality among the mentally and/or physically disabled. The sexological study of [[sexual dysfunction]]s and disorders, including [[erectile dysfunction]], [[anorgasmia]], and [[pedophilia]], are also mainstays.

==History==
===Early===
[[sex manual|Sexual manuals]] have existed since antiquity, such as [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'', the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' of [[Vatsyayana]], the ''[[Ananga Ranga]]'' and ''[[The Perfumed Garden|The Perfumed Garden for the Soul's Recreation]]''.  {{lang|fr|De la prostitution dans la ville de Paris}} (''Prostitution in the City of Paris''), an early 1830s study on 3,558 registered prostitutes in [[Paris]], published by Alexander Jean Baptiste Parent-Duchatelet (and published in 1837, a year after he died), has been called the first work of modern sex research.&lt;ref name=Bullough1989&gt;Bullough, V. L. (1989). ''The society for the scientific study of sex: A brief history.'' Mt. Vernon, Iowa: The Foundation for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific study of sexual behavior in human beings began in the 19th century. Shifts in [[Europe]]'s national borders at that time brought into conflict laws that were sexually liberal and laws that criminalized behaviors such as homosexual activity.

===Victorian Era to WWII===
[[File:Portrait of Havelock Ellis (1859-1939), Psychologist and Biologist (2575987702) crop.jpg|thumb|[[Havelock Ellis]], a pioneering figure in the movement towards sexual emancipation in the late 19th century.]]

Despite the prevailing social attitude of sexual repression in [[Victorian morality|the Victorian era]], the movement towards sexual emancipation began towards the end of the nineteenth century in England and Germany. In 1886, [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing]] published ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis (book)|Psychopathia Sexualis]].'' That work is considered as having established sexology as a scientific discipline.&lt;ref name = Hoenig1977&gt;Hoenig, J. (1977). Dramatis personae: Selected biographical sketches of 19th century pioneers in sexology. In J. Money and H. Musaph (Eds.), ''Handbook of Sexology,'' (pp. 21-43). Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the founding father of sexology was the doctor and sexologist [[Havelock Ellis]] who challenged the sexual taboos of his era regarding [[masturbation]] and [[homosexuality]] and revolutionized the conception of sex in his time. His seminal work was the 1897 ''Sexual Inversion'', which describes the sexual relations of homosexual males, including men with boys. Ellis wrote the first objective study of homosexuality, (the term was coined by Kertbeny) as he did not characterize it as a disease, immoral, or a crime. The work assumes that same-sex love transcended age [[taboo]]s as well as gender taboos. Seven of his twenty-one case studies are of inter-generational relationships. He also developed other important psychological concepts, such as [[autoerotism]] and [[narcissism]], both of which were later developed further by [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Language of Psycho-analysis|author1=Laplanche, J.|author2=Pontalis, J.B.|date=1988|publisher=Karnac Books|isbn=9780946439492|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA45|page=45|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis pioneered [[transgender]] phenomena alongside the German [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]. He established it as new category that was separate and distinct from homosexuality.&lt;ref name=ttp&gt;Ekins, Richard and King, Dave (2006) ''The transgender phenomenon'', SAGE, {{ISBN|0-7619-7163-7}}, pp. 61-64&lt;/ref&gt; Aware of Hirschfeld's studies of [[transvestism]], but disagreeing with his terminology, in 1913 Ellis proposed the term ''sexo-aesthetic inversion'' to describe the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=ellis1933&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Albert|title=Psychology of Sex|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSLybrnLVeIC&amp;pg=PA209year=1933|isbn=9781443735322|publisher=Read Books|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5dNnT3GuF_gC&amp;dq=father+of+sexology+ellis|title=The Real Facts Of Life: Feminism And The Politics Of Sexuality C1850-1940|author=Jackson, Margaret|year=1994|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780203992395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, the first scholarly journal of the field, ''Journal of Sexology'' (Zeitschrift für Sexualwissenschaft), began publication and was published monthly for one year. Those issues contained articles by Freud, [[Alfred Adler]], and [[Wilhelm Stekel]].&lt;ref name=Haeberle&gt;Haeberle, E. J. (1983). ''The birth of sexology: A brief history in documents.'' World Association for Sexology.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, the first academic association was founded: the ''Society for Sexology''.&lt;ref&gt;Kewenig, W. A. (1983). Foreword. In E. J. Haeberle, ''The birth of sexology: A brief history in documents''. World Association for Sexology. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud developed a theory of sexuality. These stages of development include: Oral, Anal, Phallic, Latency and Genital. These stages run from infancy to puberty and onwards.&lt;ref name="gutenberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14969 |title=Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex by Sigmund Freud - Free Ebook |publisher=gutenberg.org|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on his studies of his clients, between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. [[Wilhelm Reich]] and [[Otto Gross]], were disciples of Freud, but rejected by his theories{{vague|date=November 2013}} because of their emphasis on the role of sexuality in the revolutionary struggle for the emancipation of mankind.

[[Image:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|left|thumb|Hirschfeld's books were burned by the Nazis in Berlin for being "un-German".]]
Pre-Nazi Germany, under the sexually liberal [[Napoleonic code]], organized and resisted the anti-sexual, Victorian cultural influences. The momentum from those groups led them to coordinate sex research across traditional [[academic discipline]]s, bringing Germany to the leadership of sexology. Physician [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] was an outspoken advocate for sexual minorities, founding the [[Scientific Humanitarian Committee]], the first advocacy for homosexual and transgender rights.&lt;ref&gt;Goltz, Dustin (2008). Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer movements. In A. Lind &amp; S. Brzuzy (Eds.), ''Battleground: Women, gender, and sexuality, 2,'' 291. Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|978-0-313-34039-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirschfeld also set up the first [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sexology) in Berlin in 1919. Its library housed over 20,000 volumes, 35,000 photographs, a large collection of art and other objects. People from around [[Europe]] visited the Institute to gain a clearer understanding of their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and to be treated for their sexual concerns and dysfunctions.

Hirschfeld developed a system which identified numerous actual or hypothetical types of sexual intermediary between heterosexual male and female to represent the potential diversity of human sexuality, and is credited with identifying a group of people that today are referred to as [[transsexual]] or [[transgender]] as separate from the categories of homosexuality, he referred to these people as 'transvestiten' (transvestites).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= Hirschfeld | first= Magnus | title= Die Transvestiten.

Other sexologists in the early [[gay rights]] movement included [[Ernst Burchard]], [[Hans Blüher]], and [[Benedict Friedlaender]]. [[Ernst Gräfenberg]], after whom the [[G-spot]] is named, published the initial research developing the [[intrauterine device]] (IUD).

===Post WWII===
After World War II, sexology experienced a renaissance, both in the United States and Europe. Large scale studies of sexual behavior, sexual function, and [[sexual dysfunction]] gave rise to the development of [[sex therapy]].&lt;ref name=Haeberle/&gt; Post-WWII sexology in the U.S. was influenced by the influx of European refugees escaping the Nazi regime and the popularity of the [[Kinsey Reports|Kinsey studies]]. Until that time, American sexology consisted primarily of groups working to end [[prostitution]] and to educate youth about [[sexually transmitted diseases]].&lt;ref name =Bullough1989/&gt; [[Alfred Kinsey]] founded the [[Institute for Sex Research]] at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] at [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] in 1947. This is now called the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction]]. He wrote in his 1948 book that more was scientifically known about the sexual behavior of farm animals than of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kinsey | first1 = Alfred C. | last2 = Martin | first2 = Clyde E. | last3 = Pomeroy | first3 = Wardell B. | author-link1 = Alfred Kinsey | author-link2 = Clyde Martin | author-link3 = Wardell Pomeroy | title = Sexual behavior in the human male | page = 3 | publisher = W.B. Saunders | location = New York and Philadelphia | year = 1948 | oclc = 705195970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist and sexologist [[John Money]] developed theories on sexual identity and [[gender identity]] in the 1950s. His work, notably on the [[David Reimer]] case has since been regarded as controversial, even while the case was key to the development of treatment protocols for [[intersex]] infants and children.&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Diamond | first1 = Milton | last2 = Sigmundson | first2 = H.

[[Kurt Freund]] developed the [[penile plethysmograph]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] in the 1950s. The device was designed to provide an objective measurement of [[sexual arousal]] in males and is currently used in the assessment of [[pedophilia]] and [[hebephilia]]. This tool has since been used with [[sex offenders]].&lt;ref name="apobit"&gt;{{cite news | last = Associated Press | title = Kurt Freund, 82, notable sexologist | url = http://www.s-t.com/daily/10-96/10-29-96/c06wn888.htm | date = October 26, 1996 }} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kubanobit"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kuban | first = Michael | title = Sexual Science Mentor: Dr. Kurt Freund | journal = Sexual Science | volume = 45 | issue = 2 | url = http://sexscience.org/uploads/media/sex_sci45-2.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101222215801/http://sexscience.org/uploads/media/sex_sci45-2.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2010-12-22 | date = Summer 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 and 1970, [[Masters and Johnson]] released their works ''Human Sexual Response'' and ''Human Sexual Inadequacy,'' respectively. Those volumes sold well, and they were founders of what became known as the [[Masters &amp; Johnson Institute]] in 1978.

[[Vern Bullough]] was a historian of sexology during this era, as well as being a researcher in the field.&lt;ref name="vernbullough"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vernbullough.com/bullough/publications/publicationsindex.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040727172744/http://www.vernbullough.com/bullough/publications/publicationsindex.html |archivedate=July 27, 2004 |dead-url=yes |title=Dr. Vern L. Bullough: Profile |publisher=web.archive.org |website=vernbullough.com |accessdate=July 25, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of [[HIV/AIDS]] in the 1980s caused a dramatic shift in sexological research efforts towards understanding and controlling the spread of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gagnon | first = John H. | title = Sex research and sexual conduct in the era of AIDS | journal = [[Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes]] | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 593–601 | publisher = [[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]] | pmid = 3225745 | date = December 1988 | url = http://journals.lww.com/jaids/Abstract/1988/12000/Sex_Research_and_Sexual_Conduct_in_the_Era_of.11.aspx | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Oriel | first = Jennifer | title = Sexual pleasure as a human right: Harmful or helpful to women in the context of HIV/AIDS? | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 392–404 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.wsif.2005.05.002 | date = September 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wsif.2005.05.002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/248654/original/sexual+pleasure+as+a+HR.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shanghai Ocean University - Jungong Road Campus.JPG|thumb|Jungong Road Campus of Shanghai Ocean University]]

'''Shanghai Ocean University''' ({{zh|c=上海海洋大学}}) is a [[public university]] in [[Shanghai]], [[China]].

The university changed its name to the current name on 6 May 2008, authorized by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Education The People's Republic of China]], and the whole school was to be moved to [[Lingang New City]] in August 2008. Its former name is Shanghai Fisheries University (上海水产大学). It is a Chinese Ministry of Education [[Double First Class University Plan|Double First Class Discipline University]], with Double First Class status in certain disciplines.&lt;ref name="Chinese Department of Education"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A22/moe_843/201709/t20170921_314942.html |title=教育部 财政部 国家发展改革委 关于公布世界一流大学和一流学科建设高校及建设 学科名单的通知 (Notice from the Ministry of Education and other national governmental departments announcing the list of double first class universities and disciplines)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1912, Shanghai Ocean University was on the bank of the Huangpu River, with an area of 700,000 square meters. The university is characterized by aquaculture, food science, fishery economics, fishery laws, and stresses the coordinated development of multiple disciplines and expertise in agriculture, science, engineering, economics, arts and management.

{{Marxism|Variants}}

'''Structural Marxism''' was an approach to [[Marxist philosophy]] based on [[structuralism]], primarily associated with the work of the French philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] and his students. It was influential in France during the 1960s and 1970s, and also came to influence philosophers, political theorists and sociologists outside France during the 1970s. Other proponents of structural Marxism were the [[sociologist]] [[Nicos Poulantzas]] and the [[anthropologist]] [[Maurice Godelier]].  Many of Althusser's students broke with structural Marxism in the late 1960s and 1970s.

==Overview==
Structural Marxism arose in opposition to the [[Marxist humanism|humanistic Marxism]] that dominated many western universities during the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In contrast to Humanistic Marxism, Althusser stressed that Marxism was a [[science]] that examined objective structures,&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, L. (1971). Lenin and Philosophy. In ''Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays''. NY: Monthly Review Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and he believed that [[Marxist humanism|humanistic]], [[Historicism#Karl Marx|historistic]] and [[Open Marxism|phenomenological Marxism]], which was based on Marx's early works, was caught in a "pre-scientific humanistic ideology".&lt;ref&gt;Heine Andersen and L. B. Kaspersen (ed.). ''Classical and Modern Social Theory'', Blackwell publishers, Oxford, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the middle of the 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Marxist theorists began to develop structuralist Marxist accounts of the state, law, and crime. Structuralist Marxism disputes the [[Instrumental Marxism|instrumentalist]] view that the state can be viewed as the direct servant of the capitalist or ruling class. Whereas the instrumentalist position argues that the institutions of the state are under the direct control of those members of the capitalist class in positions of state power, the structuralist perspective takes the position that the institutions of the state must function in such a way as to ensure ongoing viability of capitalism more generally. Another way that Marxists put this is that the institutions of the state must function so as to reproduce capitalist society as a whole. The [[Miliband-Poulantzas debate]] between instrumentalist [[Ralph Miliband]] and structuralist [[Nicos Poulantzas]] characterized the debate between structural and instrumental Marxists.&lt;ref&gt;Poulantzas, N. &amp; Miliband R. (1972). The Problem of the Capitalist State. In R. Blackburn (ed.) Ideology in Social Science: Readings in Critical Social Theory. NY: Pantheon Books, pp. 238–262.&lt;/ref&gt;

Structuralists view the state in a [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] as taking a specifically capitalist form, not because particular individuals are in powerful positions, but because the state reproduces the logic of capitalist structure in its economic, legal, and political institutions. Hence, from a structuralist perspective one would argue that the institutions of the state (including its legal institutions) function in the long-term interests of capital and capitalism, rather than in the short term interests of members of the capitalist class. Structuralists would thus argue that the state and its institutions have a certain degree of independence from specific elites in the ruling or capitalist class.

==Long- versus short-term class interests==
Structural Marxism posits that the state functions to serve the long-term interests of the [[Bourgeosie|capitalist class]]. Building upon the works of [[Engels]] and [[Lenin]], structural Marxists posit the idea that the state is a mechanism for regulating [[class conflict]], the irreconcilable tension between the [[proletariat]] and the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref name=Lenin&gt;Lenin, V.I. (2004/1917). ''The State and Revolution''. Whitefish, MT: Kessinger Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Offe&gt;Offe, Claus (1974). ''Structural Problems of the Capitalist State: Class Rule and the Political System''. In [[Klaus von Beyme]] (ed.) ''German Political Studies, vol. 1''. Beverly Hills, CA: Sage Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; By regulating these antagonisms rather than eliminating them—which Lenin thought was impossible without violent revolution&lt;ref name=Lenin /&gt;—the state serves to stabilize the capitalist system as a whole and preserve its existence.

Structuralists differentiate between the long-term and short-term interests of the capitalist class in order to describe the necessity of the state to the capitalism system. Short-term interests of the bourgeoisie include policies that affect capital accumulation in the immediate future such as tax breaks, reduced minimum wages, government subsidies, etc. They maintain that when the state is not benefiting the bourgeois class’ short-term interests, it is acting on the behalf of its future interests. Accordingly, when the state seems to act on behalf of the proletariat rather than the bourgeoisie (raising minimum wages, increasing rights of workers’ unions, etc.) it is serving capitalist interests by meeting the demands of workers only enough to prevent an uprising that could threaten the system as a whole. Because the interests of the proletariat and the capitalist classes are counter to one another, the state is necessary to regulate the capitalist system and assure its preservation by forcing capitalists to agree to demands of workers to which they otherwise would not succumb.&lt;ref name=Offe /&gt;

==Criticism==
In a 1971 paper for ''[[Socialist Register]]'', Polish philosopher [[Leszek Kołakowski]]&lt;ref&gt;Kołakowski, Leszek (1971), "[http://www.socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5334/2235 Althusser's Marx]". ''Socialist Register'' 1971, pp. 111–28.&lt;/ref&gt; undertook a detailed critique of structural Marxism, arguing that the concept was seriously flawed on three main points:

:I will argue that the whole of Althusser's theory is made up of the following elements : 1. common sense banalities expressed with the help of unnecessarily complicated [[neologisms]]; 2. traditional Marxist concepts that are vague and ambiguous in [[Marx]] himself (or in Engels) and which remain, after Althusser's explanation, exactly as vague and ambiguous as they were before; 3. some striking historical inexactitudes.

Kołakowski further argued that, despite Althusser's claims of scientific rigor, structural Marxism was [[unfalsifiable]] and thus unscientific, and was best understood as a quasi-religious [[ideology]]. In 1980, sociologist Axel van den Berg&lt;ref&gt;Van den Berg, Axel (1980). "Critical Theory: Is There Still Hope?" ''The American Journal of Sociology'', Vol. 86 No. 3 (Nov 1980), pp. 449–478.&lt;/ref&gt; described Kołakowski's critique as "devastating," proving that "Althusser retains the orthodox radical rhetoric by simply severing all connections with verifiable facts."

Similar arguments have been made concerning structural theories  of the capitalist nature of the state. [[Claus Offe]] averred that the class-character of the state could only be observed in an ''ex post'' perspective. In other words, the class character of the state can only be shown after policies are put in place and the outcome is observed. Because of this, he criticizes structural theories which attempt to prove the capitalist character of the state, claiming they do so on an unfounded basis: because outcomes of the state's policies are empirically capitalist, it does not make the State a capitalist enterprise in its nature.&lt;ref name=Offe /&gt;{{rp| 45–46}}

[[File:Congres Team 10 in Otterlo - Team 10 Meeting in Otterlo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Otterlo]] Meeting 1959 (also CIAM '59), organized by Team 10, 43 participants. Meeting place: [[Kröller-Müller Museum]], located in the [[Hoge Veluwe National Park]]. Dissolution of the organization CIAM.]]
'''Team 10''' — just as often referred to as '''Team X''' or '''Team Ten''' — was a group of architects and other invited participants who assembled starting in July 1953 at the 9th Congress of the [[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne|International Congresses of Modern Architecture (CIAM)]] and created a schism within CIAM by challenging its doctrinaire approach to [[urbanism]].

==Membership==
The group's first formal meeting under the name of Team 10 took place in [[Bagnols-sur-Cèze]] in 1960. The last, with only four members present, was in Lisbon in 1981.

Team 10's core group consists of [[Pancho Guedes]], Rolf Gutmann, [[Geir Grung (architect)|Geir Grung]], Oskar Hansen,&lt;ref&gt;Stanek, L. ed., Team 10 East. Revisionist Architecture in Real Existing Modernism (Warsaw: Museum of Modern Art/ Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reima Pietilä]], Charles Polonyi, Brian Richards, [[Jerzy Soltan]], [[Oswald Mathias Ungers]], [[John Voelcker]], and Stefan Wewerka.

They referred to themselves as "a small family group of architects who have sought each other out because each has found the help of the others necessary to the development and understanding of their own individual work."&lt;ref name="alison"&gt;Smithson, Alison [ed] ''Team 10 Primer'', [[MIT Press|The MIT Press]], (1968), {{ISBN|0-289-79556-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team 10's theoretical framework, disseminated primarily through teaching and publications, had a profound influence on the development of architectural thought in the second half of the 20th century, primarily in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Two different movements emerged from Team 10: the [[New Brutalism]] of the English members (Alison and Peter Smithson) and the [[Structuralism (architecture)|Structuralism]] of the Dutch members (Aldo van Eyck and Jacob Bakema).

==History==
Team 10's core group started meeting within the context of CIAM, the international platform for modern architects founded in 1928.&lt;ref name="Team10online Intro"&gt;http://www.team10online.org [http://www.team10online.org/team10/introduction.html ''Introduction - The Team 10 story''] by Max Risselada &amp; Dirk van den Heuvel.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6915">'''The Global Media Monitoring Project''' (GMMP) is the largest international study of gender in the news media. It is also an advocacy organization that aims to change the representation of women in the news media. Every five years since 1995 the GMMP collects data on indicators of gender in the news, such as: the presence of women, gender bias, and stereotyping. The most recent study, conducted in 2015, encompassed 114 countries.&lt;ref name=Who_makes&gt;{{cite web | title = Who makes the news? | url = http://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp | publisher = [[World Association for Christian Communication]] | accessdate = 23 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The idea for a media monitoring project was created at the Women Empowering Communication international conference in Bangkok in 1994. The [[World Association for Christian Communication|World Association for Christian Communication (WACC)]] along with MediaWatch (Canada) took up the project. They had several key goals:
*To map the representation and portrayal of women in the world’s mainstream news media
*To develop a grassroots research instrument
*To build solidarity among gender and communication groups worldwide
*To create media awareness
*To develop media monitoring skills on an international level&lt;ref name=Who_makes2&gt;{{cite web | title = Who makes the news?: Beginnings, GMMP 1995 | url = http://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp | publisher = [[World Association for Christian Communication]] | accessdate = 18 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coverage'''

The 1995 Report covered 71 countries, and was conducted by volunteers over the span of one day. Consequent studies took place in 2000 and covered 70 countries, in 2005 covering 76 countries, in 2010 in 108 countries and in 2015 in 114 countries. All of the monitoring and compiling of reports is carried out by volunteers. GMMP reports have been presented at the Women’s NGO Forum in Beijing (1995), the UN Beijing + 5 (2000), a parallel-session at the Commission on the Status of Women 2010 session, and in 100 Women BBC series 2015 "Is News Failing Women?".&lt;ref name=Who_makes2 /&gt;

==2015 Report==

The 2015 Project covered 22,136 news items, 26,010 news personnel, and 45,402 total news subjects in newspaper, radio, television, internet news and news media tweets.  The research discussed news subjects, personnel and content through the framework of media accountability to women .&lt;ref name=Exec&gt;{{citation | last = Macharia | first = Sarah | title = Who makes the news? Global media monitoring project (GMMP) 2015 | page = 12 | publisher = [[World Association for Christian Communication]] | location = Toronto | year = 2015 | url = http://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp/gmmp-reports/gmmp-2015-reports | ref = harv | postscript = . |oclc=833313633}} [http://cdn.agilitycms.com/who-makes-the-news/Imported/reports_2015/global/gmmp_global_report_en.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''News Subjects'''

The report discovered that progress towards gender parity in the news has almost ground to a halt over the period 2010 to 2015: Women make up only 24% of the persons heard, read about or seen in newspaper, television and radio news, exactly as they did in 2010. Over the past two decades, the gender gap in people in the news has narrowed most dramatically in Latin America by 13 percent.  Women are three percent less visible in political news stories now than five years ago. They comprise 38% of people interviewed on the basis of personal experience compared to 31% in 2005. North America has the highest percentage of women experts in the news (32%), followed by the Caribbean (29%) and Latin America (29%). In 2015, progress towards news representation that acknowledges women's participation in economic life remain elusive: While women in the real world hold at least 40% of paid employment globally, in the news world only 20% of the workers in the formal labor force are women, while 67% of the news world unemployed and stay-at-home parents are women. Portrayals of women as survivors of domestic violence have risen by more than four times across the period 2005 to 2015.&lt;ref name=Exec /&gt;

'''Reporters and Presenters'''

The 2015 GMMP detected what appears to be a global glass ceiling for female news reporters as far as they are visible in newspaper bylines and newscast reports. Women have consistently reported only 37% of the news over the past decade from 2005 to 2015. Women as news reporters are most present on radio, at 41%, and least in print news, at 35%. Younger presenters on screen are predominantly female, but the scales tip dramatically at 50 years old when men begin to dominate the news-anchoring scene. At 65 years and older, women disappear from the screen as reporters and presenters.&lt;ref name=Exec /&gt;

'''News Content'''

9% of stories overall contain reference to legal, rights or policy frameworks, with social and legal stories making the highest contribution to the global average. A rights angle is barely present is political and economic stories. 97% of political stories in Asia, 98% of economic stories in the Pacific region and the Middle East perform poorly on the rights-focus yardstick. 14% of stories by female reporters focus centrally on women, in contrast to 9% of stories by their male counterparts. 9% of stories evoke gender equality or inequality issues, more than double the percentage documented in 2005. Only 4% of stories clearly challenge gender stereotypes, a one percent change since 2005.&lt;ref name=Exec /&gt;

'''Digital News'''

Women's relative invisibility in traditional news media has crossed over into digital news delivery platforms: Only 26% of the people in internet news stories and media news tweets combined are women. Women report five percent more stories online than in the traditional mediums combined: 42% of online news are reported by women. Gender difference in source selection by female and male reporters becomes starker in online news: Women are 33% of sources in stories by online news female reporters, compared to 23% in stories by men. Only 4% of news media tweets clearly challenge gender stereotypes, exactly similar to the overall percentage of print, radio and television stories that challenge such stereotypes.&lt;ref name=Exec /&gt;

==Implications==

The GMMP 1995 - 2015 findings paint a picture in which unequal gender power relations are entrenched and validated, and in which gender stereotypes are replicated and reinforced by the world's news media.

That the patterns of underrepresentation, misrepresentation and invisibilization of women have continued into the digital news world show that the problem is deeply entrenched in the mainstream news media system irrespective of the platform through which news are channeled.

The symbol features three [[hare]]s or [[rabbit]]s chasing each other in a circle. Like the [[triskelion]],&lt;ref name="Widecombe"/&gt; the [[triquetra]], and their antecedents (e.g., the [[triple spiral]]), the symbol of the three hares has a threefold [[rotational symmetry]]. Each of the ears is shared by two hares, so that only three ears are shown. Although its meaning is apparently not explained in contemporary written sources from any of the medieval cultures where it is found, it is thought to have a range of symbolic or mystical associations with fertility and the [[lunar phase|lunar cycle]]. When used in Christian churches, it is presumed to be a symbol of the [[Trinity]]. Its origins and original significance are uncertain, as are the reasons why it appears in such diverse locations.&lt;ref name="Chapman"/&gt;

==Origins in Buddhism and diffusion on the Silk Road==
[[File:Three Hares Symbol - Map.svg|thumb|upright=2.2|right|The spread of the three hares symbol between 600 and 1500]]
The earliest occurrences appear to be in cave temples in China, dated to the [[Sui dynasty]] (6th to 7th centuries).&lt;ref name="Zhang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="travels"&gt;[http://idp.bl.uk/archives /news18/idpnews_18.a4d [[International Dunhuang Project]] Newsletter No. 18.  ''The Travels of the Three Rabbits: Shared Iconography Across the Silk Road'']. {{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[iconography]] spread along the [[Silk Road]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9AUxnUNRekgC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;lpg=PA290&amp;dq=Three+hares+running&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OabnwWDpdO&amp;sig=Xkw0E8V8lwLxDA0AXyV91FiHYQE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fAE-TOTQDIK8lQed4_34BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Three%20hares%20running&amp;f=false Whitfield, Susan, ''The Silk Road: trade, travel, war and faith'', p. 290.] London: The [[British Library]].  {{ISBN|1-932476-13-X}}; {{ISBN|978-1-932476-13-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a symbol associated with [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="Windling"/&gt; The hares have been said to be "A [[hieroglyph]] of 'to be'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.szasz.com/hare.pdf |title=Staedlin, Naomi, (November 7, 2004) '&amp;#39;The rabbits as a hieroglyph of 'to be'.'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-03-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67ArKuuYo?url=http://www.szasz.com/hare.pdf |archivedate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other contexts the [[metaphor]] has been given different meaning.  For example, Guan Youhui, a retired researcher from the [[Dunhuang Academy]], who spent 50 years studying the decorative patterns in the [[Mogao Caves]], believes the three rabbits—"like many images in [[Chinese folk art]] that carry auspicious symbolism—represent peace and tranquility."&lt;ref name="Zhang"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.threerabbits.net/ |first1=Chris |last1=Chapman |first2=Zhang |last2=Wei |last3=Rasmussen |first3=Peter |title=The Three Rabbits in China |work=Adapted from a presentation at the International Conference on [[Grotto]]es Research |location=Dunhuang China |date=August 2004|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="travels"/&gt; ''See'' [[Aurel Stein]].

The three hares appear on 13th century [[Mongols|Mongol]] metalwork, and on a copper coin, found in [[Iran]], dated to 1281.&lt;ref name="threehares.net"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.threehares.net | title=The Three Hares | accessdate=2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://db.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/hares.shtml |title=Chasing Hares |date=16 November 2004 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2008-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212064007/http://db.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/hares.shtml |archivedate=12 February 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tomgreeves.org/the_three_hares.html | title=The Three Hares | author= [http://www.tomgreeves.org/ Tom Greeves] | accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another appears on an ancient Islamic-made [[reliquary]] from southern Russia. Another 13th or early 14th century box, later used as a reliquary, was made in [[Iran]] under [[Mongol]] rule, and is preserved in the treasury of the [[Cathedral of Trier]] in Germany. On its base, the casket has Islamic designs, and originally featured two images of the three hares. One was lost through damage.&lt;ref name="meaning"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Chris |last1=Chapman |url=http://www.chrischapmanphotography.co.uk/hares/index.html |work=Three Hares Project |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67Asmlqi9?url=http://www.chrischapmanphotography.co.uk/hares/index.html |archivedate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |title=What does the Symbol Mean? |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory pertaining to the spread of the motif is that it was transported from China across Asia and as far as the south west of England by merchants travelling the [[silk road]] and that the motif was transported via designs found on expensive [[Chinese ceramics|Oriental ceramics]]. This view is supported by the early date of the surviving occurrences in China. However, the majority of representations of the three hares in churches occur in England and northern Germany. This supports a contrary view that the three hares occurred independently as English or early German symbols.&lt;ref name="Chapman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="travels"/&gt;&lt;ref name="puzzle"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.threehares.net/puzzles.html | title=The Three Rabbits and Similar Puzzles | author=Singmaster, David |date = August 2004| accessdate=November 11, 2008| publisher=threehares.net | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918164613/http://www.threehares.net/puzzles.html | archivedate=18 September 2008 | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that the Devon name, Tinners' Rabbits, is related to local [[Dartmoor tin-mining|tin miners]] adopting it. The mines generated wealth in the region and funded the building and repair of many local churches, and thus the symbol may have been used as a sign of the miners' patronage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/three_hares.htm | title=The Tinner's Rabbits | author=Sandles, Tim | publisher=Legendary Dartmoor | date=23 November 2007 | accessdate=2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ornament (architecture)|architectural ornament]] of the three hares also occurs in churches that are unrelated to the miners of South West England.  Other occurrences in England include floor tiles at [[Chester Cathedral]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:7gmsuBKphC0J:www.cheshirewestandchester.gov.uk/visiting/heritage/archaeology/idoc.ashx%3Fdocid%3Da1e344d2-e034-4e75-be85-98ed4ece781f%26version%3D-1+three+hares+chester&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgMqXBfw-mvBT3_AZ5KnzDpUjwT5pik-gSyTJI6wpQXn4Od5hI10k54W8sUz9qhk-acrzKxQAWpiY7q1Bq8FQExwnvVsWobptu9pvl3a84IMS8dra-D4mghOq4E-Cch5GefRNTM&amp;sig=AHIEtbRIEWcY1KRQp2amOyhcsuPLrEwDcQ | title=The archaeology of Cheshire West and Chester in ten objects }}&lt;/ref&gt; stained glass at [[Long Melford]], Suffolk&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;At the [[Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford]], above the northern door, is a small stained glass [[roundel]], only a few inches in diameter.  {{cite web|url=http://www.theukcuriosityblog.com/look/photo/the-three-hares-window-a-medieval-mystery|title=The three hares window: a medieval mystery|date=28 February 2011|accessdate=14 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918035853/http://www.theukcuriosityblog.com/look/photo/the-three-hares-window-a-medieval-mystery|archivedate=18 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a ceiling in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], Yorkshire.&lt;ref name="Chapman"/&gt;

==In Christianity==
The motif of the three hares is used in a number of medieval European churches, particularly in France (''e.g.'', in the [[Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière]] in [[Lyon]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourhares.com/ |title=Three Hares at Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière, four hares, and three hares and three wolves, elsewhere. photographs and drawing |publisher=Fourhares.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Germany. It occurs with the greatest frequency in the churches of [[Devon]], England. The motif appears in [[illuminated manuscripts]],&lt;ref name="|Terrier"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trois-lievres.skyrock.com/ |title=Three hares and their ears commune (''Trois lièvres à oreilles communes'') |first2=Tom (Archaeologist and historian)|last2=Greeves |first3=Sue (researcher)|last3=Andrew |first1=Michel |last1=Terrier |language=French |date=9 September 2007 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; architectural [[wood carving]], [[stone carving]], window [[tracery]] and [[stained glass]]. In South Western England there are over thirty recorded examples of the three hares appearing on '[[roof boss]]es' (carved wooden knobs) on the ceilings in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] churches in [[Devon]], (particularly [[Dartmoor]]). There is a good example of a roof boss of the three hares at [[Widecombe-in-the-Moor]],&lt;ref name="Widecombe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.widecombe-in-the-moor.com/history/minutes/2005/the_three_hares.php |first1=Tom, Dr. |last1=Greeves |first2=Sue |last2=Andrews |first3=Chris |last3=Chapman |title=From China to Widecombe: The Extraordinary Journey of The Three Hares |publisher=Widecombe-in-the-Moor |accessdate=24 April 2012 |date=26 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dartmoor, with another in the town of [[Tavistock, Devon|Tavistock]] on the edge of the moor. The [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] occurs with similar central placement in Synagogues.&lt;ref name="Wonnenberg"/&gt; Another occurrence is on the [[ossuary]] that by tradition contained the bones of [[Lazarus of Bethany|St. Lazarus]].&lt;ref name="Shackle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdb.co.za/shackle/articles/three_hares.htm |last1=Shackle |first1=Eric |work=Eric Shackle's e-book |title=Three Hares Share Three Ears |accessdate=24 April 2012 |year=2006 |location=Sydney, Australia |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67AsPtdXu?url=http://www.bdb.co.za/shackle/articles/three_hares.htm |archivedate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where it occurs in England, the three hares motif usually appears in a prominent place in the church, such as the central rib of the [[chancel]] roof, or on a central rib of the [[nave]]. This suggests that the symbol held significance to the church, and casts doubt on the theory that they may have been a masons' or carpenters' signature marks.&lt;ref name="Chapman"/&gt; There are two possible and perhaps concurrent reasons why the three hares may have found popularity as a symbol within the church. Firstly, it was widely believed that the hare was [[hermaphrodite]] and could reproduce without loss of [[virginity]].&lt;ref name="meaning"/&gt; This led to an association with the [[Virgin Mary]], with hares sometimes occurring in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Northern Renaissance|Northern European]] paintings of the Virgin and [[Christ Child]]. The other Christian association may have been with the [[Holy Trinity]],&lt;ref name="meaning"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://threehares.blogspot.com/2006/02/why-three-hares_25.html |title=Three Hares as representation of the Trinity |publisher=Threehares.blogspot.com |date=25 February 2006 |accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing the ''"One in Three and Three in One"'' of which the triangle or three interlocking shapes such as rings are common symbols. In many locations the three hares are positioned adjacent to the [[Green Man]], a symbol commonly believed to be associated with the continuance of [[Anglo-Saxon]] or [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Christianity and Paganism|paganism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba100/feat5.shtml |title=Green Men &amp; The Way of All Flesh |first1=Richard |last1=Hayma |accessdate=31 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131231951/http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba100/feat5.shtml |archivedate=31 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These juxtapositions may have been created to imply the contrast of the Divine with man's [[sin]]ful, earthly nature.&lt;ref name="meaning"/&gt;

==In Judaism==
In Judaism, the "[[Rock Hyrax|shafan]]" in [[Hebrew]] has symbolic meaning.&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;In [[Hebrew]], the rock hyrax is called שפן סלע (''shafan sela''), meaning ''rock "shafan"'', where the meaning of ''shafan'' is obscure, but is [[colloquially]] used as a synonym for rabbit in modern Hebrew. {{cite web|first1=Nosson |last1=Slifkin |authorlink1=Natan Slifkin |work=The camel, the hare &amp; the hyrax: a study of the laws of animals with one kosher sign in light of modern zoology |location=Southfield, MI; [[Nanuet, NY]] |publisher=Zoo Torah in association with Targum/Feldheim Distributed by Feldheim |chapter=6 |title=Shafan–The Hyrax |url=http://www.zootorah.com/hyrax/hyrax.pdf |format=PDF |date=1 March 2004 |isbn=1-56871-312-6 |pages=99–135 |accessdate=25 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616192614/http://www.zootorah.com/hyrax/hyrax.pdf |archivedate=16 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }} {{ISBN|978-1-56871-312-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although rabbits are listed as a non-[[kosher]] animal in the Bible{{mdash}}they at least arguably chew their cud{{efn-ua|Even though they are not a [[ruminant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://answersingenesis.org/contradictions-in-the-bible/do-rabbits-really-chew-the-cud/ |title=Do rabbits really chew their cud |work=Demolishing Supposed Bible Contradictions |volume=2  |accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} lacking [[Cloven hoof|cloven hooves]]{{mdash}}rabbits can carry very positive symbolic connotations, like [[Three Lions (disambiguation)|lions]] and eagles. 16th century German scholar [[Rabbi]] [[Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi]], saw the rabbits as a symbol of the [[Jewish diaspora]].  The replica of the [[Khodoriv|Chodorow]] [[Synagogue]] from Poland (on display at the [[Beth Hatefutsoth|Museum of the Jewish Diaspora]] in [[Tel Aviv]]) has a ceiling with a large central painting which depicts a double-headed eagle holds two brown rabbits in its claws without harming them. The painting is surrounded by a citation from the end of [[Deuteronomy]]:

{{quote|
:.כנשר יעיר קינו על גוזליו ירחף. יפרוש כנפיו יקחהו ישאהו על אברתו
|Deuteronomy 32:11, [[The Song of Moses]]}}

This may be translated: "As an eagle that stirreth up her nest, hovereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her pinions  (...thus is [[God]] to the Jewish people)."&lt;ref name="Wonnenberg"/&gt;

The hare frequently appears in the form of the symbol of the "rotating rabbits".  An ancient German [[riddle]] describes this graphic thus:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Three hares sharing three ears,
Yet every one of them has two.&lt;ref name="Wonnenberg"/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

This curious graphic riddle can be found in all of the famous [[wooden synagogues]] from the period of the 17th and 18th century in the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashknaz]] region (in Germany) that are on museum display in [[Beth Hatefutsoth]] Museum in Tel Aviv, the [[Jewish Museum Berlin]]  and The [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem.  They also appear in the Synagogue from [[Horb am Neckar]] (donated to the Israel Museum). The three animals adorn the wooden panels of the prayer room from [[Unterlimpurg]] near [[Schwäbisch Hall]], which may be seen in replica in the Jewish Museum Berlin. They also are seen in a main exhibit of the Diaspora Museum in Tel Aviv. Israeli art historian Ida Uberman wrote about this house of worship: "... Here we find depictions of three kinds of animals, all organized in circles: eagles, fishes and hares. These three represent the Kabbalistic elements of the world: earth, water and fire/heavens... The fact that they are always three is important, for that number . . . is important in the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] context".&lt;ref name="Wonnenberg"/&gt;

Not only do they appear among floral and animal ornaments, but they are often in a distinguished location, directly above the [[Torah ark]], the place where the [[Religious text|holy scriptures]] repose.&lt;ref name="Wonnenberg"/&gt;

They appear on [[headstones]] in [[Sataniv]] (Сатанів), [[Khmelnytsky Oblast]], western [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mac.com/ruthellengruber/general_site/Sataniv.html |title=Gruber, Ruth Ellen.

It notes:

:The secret is not great when one knows it.
:But it is something to one who does it.
:Turn and turn again and we will also turn,
:So that we give pleasure to each of you.
:And when we have turned, count our ears,
:It is there, without any disguise, you will find a marvel.&lt;ref name="puzzle"/&gt;

"These are the oldest known dated examples of the Three Rabbits as a puzzle." One commentator believes its being a puzzle is likely reason for the image's popularity.&lt;ref name="puzzle"/&gt;

One recent philosophical book poses it as a problem in perception and an [[optical illusion]]—an example of [[contour rivalry]]. Each rabbit can be individually seen as correct—it is only when you try to see all three at once that you see the problem with defining the hares' ears. This is similar to "The Impossible [[Penrose triangle|Tribar]]" by [[Roger Penrose]],&lt;ref name="puzzle"/&gt; originated by [[Oscar Reutersvärd]]. Compare [[M.C. Escher]]'s [[impossible object]].

[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril anal sex detail.jpg|thumb|19th-century erotic painting depicting [[Hadrian]] "topping" [[Antinous]] (detail), by [[Édouard-Henri Avril|Paul Avril]]]]
In [[human sexuality]], '''top''', '''bottom''' and '''versatile''' are [[sex position]]s during [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], especially [[Men who have sex with men|between two men]]. A top is usually a person who [[Sexual penetration|penetrates]], a bottom is usually one who receives penetration, and a versatile engages in both activities or is open to engaging in either activity. These terms may be elements of [[self-identity]] that indicate an individual's usual preference, but might also describe broader sexual identities.&lt;ref name="Underwood"&gt;{{cite book | author =Steven Gregory Underwood|title =Gay men and anal eroticism: tops, bottoms, and versatiles|isbn = 1-56023-375-3|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|pages=225 pages|accessdate=2011-12-02|url=https://books.google.com/?id=i4wRl0_8NuUC&amp;pg=PA4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Top,'' ''bottom'' and ''versatile'' are also used in [[BDSM]] to describe unrelated identities and practices.

==Top==
A top is usually a person who engages in the penetrative role during sexual activity; for [[Men who have sex with men|men who have sex with men (MSMs)]], this often involves penetration using the [[Human penis|penis]] during [[Anal sex|anal]] or [[Oral sex|oral]] sex.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt; ''Top'' is also used as a verb meaning "to penetrate another". ''Top'' may also describe a broader [[self-identity|personal identity]] involving [[Dominance and submission|dominance]] in a [[romantic relationship|romantic]] or [[sexual relationship]]; however, this stipulation is not a requisite element of being a top.

Several related terms exist. With regard to gay male sexuality, a ''{{visible anchor|total top}}'' is one who assumes an exclusively penetrative role for sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gremore|first1=Graham|title=What Do You Do When Your Total Top Boyfriend Refuses To Bottom?|url=http://www.queerty.com/what-do-you-do-when-your-total-top-boyfriend-refuses-to-bottom-20150504|accessdate=24 July 2015|work=Queerty|date=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''{{visible anchor|power top}}'' is one noted for their great skill or aggressiveness in topping.  A ''{{visible anchor|service top}}'' is "one who tops under the direction of an eager bottom".&lt;ref name="DJ Symptomatic"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Carissa|title=It's Symptomatic|url=http://www.documentjournal.com/article/its-symptomatic...-by-carissa-rodriguez|website=Document Journal|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''{{visible anchor|versatile top}}'' is one who prefers to top but who bottoms occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaylife.about.com/od/lovesex/g/versatiletop.htm Versatile Top].

Trevor Hart of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) found that self-identified tops were more likely to act as the penetrative partner in other sexual activities (besides anal intercourse), including oral sex and [[sex toy]] play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bering |first=Jesse |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=gay-male-sex-roles |title=Top Scientists Get to the Bottom of Gay Male Sex Role Preferences |publisher=[[Scientific American]]|accessdate=2011-01-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319014720/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=gay-male-sex-roles|archivedate=2011-03-19|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bottom==

A bottom is usually the receptive partner during sexual penetration. This frequently refers to MSMs who are penetrated through the [[Human anus|anus]] during anal sex.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt; ''Bottom'' is also used as a verb meaning "to be penetrated by another, whether anally or orally". ''Bottom'' may also describe a wider social context of [[Dominance and submission|submission]] within a romantic or sexual relationship, though this element does not apply to all people who prefer to bottom.

In gay male sexuality, a ''total bottom'' is someone who assumes an exclusively passive or receptive role during anal or oral intercourse. A ''{{visible anchor|power bottom}}'' is someone who aggressively enjoys being the receptive partner.  A ''{{visible anchor|versatile bottom}}'' is one who prefers to bottom but who tops occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaylife.about.com/od/lovesex/g/versatilebottom.htm Versatile Bottom]. Gaylife.about.com (2012-01-01). Retrieved on 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; The term {{visible anchor|receiver}} or {{visible anchor|receptive partner}} may be preferred by some. An ''oral bottom'' (alternatively described as being the "oral active" partner) is the exclusively receptive partner in oral sex, providing the penetrative partner, or ''oral top'' (alternatively described as being the "oral passive" partner), with unreciprocated [[fellatio]] and [[irrumatio]].

==Versatile==

''Versatile'' refers to a person who enjoys both topping and bottoming, or being dominant and submissive, and may alternate between the two in sexual situations.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 17879166|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Role+versatility+among+men+who+have+sex+with+men+in+urban+Peru.-a0168586762 |title=Role versatility among men who have sex with men in urban Peru|year= 2007|last1= Goodreau|first1= SM|last2= Peinado|first2= J|last3= Goicochea|first3= P|last4= Vergara|first4= J|last5= Ojeda|first5= N|last6= Casapia|first6= M|last7= Ortiz|first7= A|last8= Zamalloa|first8= V|last9= Galvan|first9= R|last10=Sanchez |first10=Jorge R. |volume= 44|issue= 3|pages= 233–9|doi= 10.1080/00224490701443676|journal= Journal of Sex Research|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maennerarzt-linz.at/index.php?id=84 "Männer, die sowohl passiven als auch aktiven Analsex praktizieren, nennt man ''versatile''."] Georg Pfau, Präventionsmedizin für den Mann, Linz 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''Flip-flop'' or ''flip fuck'' commonly describes switching from top to bottom during one sexual encounter between two men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18288599|author=Michael D.

Versatility is a concept of [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].&lt;ref name="martinplevine1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levine |first=Martin P. |authorlink= |author2=Kimmel, Michael S.  |title=Gay Macho: The Life and Death of the homosexual Clone |year=1998 |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Versatility'', though, is not limited to the simple acts of anal, oral, or vaginal penetration, but also includes the splitting of duties and responsibilities in the relationship.&lt;ref name="jayyoung1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jay |first=Karla |authorlink= |author2=Young, Allen  |title=The gay report: Lesbians and gay men speak out about sexual experiences and lifestyles |year=1979 |publisher=Summit |location=New York |isbn=0-671-40013-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The reciprocal scenario, where both men take turns fucking each other, is often exercised as a celebration of equality. What sets this scenario apart from the others is the versatility of the men involved. Versatility is a unique and important feature of male anal sex. Some men consider it liberating;&amp;nbsp;... Versatility to them is akin to speaking two different languages. It requires a special kind of playfulness, creativity, curiosity, and coordination. |Steven G. Underwood|''Gay Men and anal eroticism: tops, bottoms, and versatiles'', Harrington Park Press 2003}}

According to some, living a ''versatile lifestyle'' implies a certain openness to new things and an opposition to [[labels]], [[stereotype]]s and [[generalization]]s. Therefore, this concept differs from heterosexual relationships where sexual compatibility does not begin with guessing who will end up as top or bottom.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt;
In self descriptions of men seeking sex with other men, they may refer to themselves as a versatile top or versatile bottom in addition to other commonly used terms.

A 2009 Austrian study on [[gay pornography]] has shown that at least 82.4% of all men performing in the male [[porn industry]] are versatile at some point during their career. In this study, the performances of 5,556 actors were considered. 10.8% performed only in the top role, 6.8% only as bottoms. The study also found that the actor with the [[human penis size|larger penis]] was more likely to act as the top.&lt;ref&gt;Michelides, Christian: ''Männlichkeitskonstruktionen der Pornografie zur Jahrtausendwende,'' Wien 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Versatility is a common theme of [[erotic artist]] [[Tom of Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Arell| first = Berndt  | last2 = Mustola  | first2 = Kati | title = Tom of Finland: Ennennäkemätöntä – Unforeseen  | publisher = Like| year = 2006 | isbn = 952-471-843-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[trans men]] who still have a [[vagina]], topping and bottoming can also involve penile penetration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hivplusmag.com/sex-dating/2015/11/23/gay-sex-ed-staying-safe-while-topping-or-bottoming |title=Gay Sex Ed: Staying Safe While Topping or Bottoming |publisher=[[LPI Media|HIV Plus Magazine]] |accessdate=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role vs. position among sexualities==

''Top'', ''bottom'' and ''versatile'', with regard to sexual activity between males, refer specifically to the penetrative role, regardless of the physical positioning during sex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaylife.about.com/od/anal/a/amitoporbottom.htm Topping or Bottoming – How To Know If You're A Top Or Bottom]. Gaylife.about.com (2012-01-01). Retrieved on 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in positions where the inserting partner lies on his back and the receptive partner straddles the inserting partner, the inserting partner is still considered to assume the "top" role, even though he is positioned on the bottom (and vice versa). When used in reference to heterosexual and [[Lesbian sexual practices|lesbian sex]], the terms ''top,'' ''bottom'' and ''versatile'' usually refer only to position and not to the penetrative role.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Prevalence==

No scientific study has ever been conducted as to what percentage of the gay and bisexual male population prefers any given role. The popular assumption is that the majority prefer to bottom and that those who prefer to top are in the minority. A tally of 55,464 profiles on [[gay.com]] from the [[United States]] showed that 26.46% preferred top, while 31.92% preferred bottom, and the largest group (41.62%) preferred versatile. The preferences seemed to vary by state, however. In Wyoming, for example, 16% preferred top, 44% preferred bottom, and 40% preferred versatile. In West Virginia, tops outnumbered bottoms by a slim margin (32% top, 29% bottom, and 39% versatile). In Oregon, "versatile" profiles made up nearly half (48.42%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightacting.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?p=222697#p222697 Best states for tops, bottoms, versatiles]. Straightacting.com. Retrieved on 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==BDSM==

In [[BDSM]], the terms ''top'', ''bottom'' and ''switch'' are related, but are a BDSM-distinct phenomenon. BDSM seems to have adopted and [[derivation (linguistics)|derived]] these terms as [[loan words]] from [[gay culture]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Other==

In the [[hanky code]], a person flagging the top or active  role would wear the hanky in the left pocket, the bottom or passive role on the right. Acts which were not divisible into distinct roles however, such as "69" or "anything" followed a pattern where one flagged interest by wearing the hanky on the right, uninterest by wearing it on the left, and preferences that did not relate to sexual mechanics, such as uniform fetishism or prostitution, followed a pattern where the seeker flagged on the left and the object of desire flagged on the right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://user.xmission.com/~trevin/hanky.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''side'' has been proposed by Huffington Post contributor [[Joe Kort]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joe-kort-phd/guys-on-the-side-looking-beyond-gay-tops-and-bottoms_b_3082484.html Guys on the 'Side': Looking Beyond Gay Tops and Bottoms] Huffingtonpost.com Retrieved 2014-10-02&lt;/ref&gt; for gay men who are not interested in anal sex.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9386">{{for|the academic journal Visual Sociology|Visual Studies (journal)}}
'''Visual sociology''' is an area of [[sociology]] concerned with the visual dimensions of social life. This subdiscipline is nurtured by the [[International Visual Sociology Association]] (IVSA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visualsociology.org|title=IVSA|website=International Visual Sociology Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; which holds annual conferences and publishes the journal, ''Visual Studies.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/1472586X.asp|title=Visual Studies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the interests of its founders, the IVSA tends to be concerned with photography and documentary filmmaking within a sociological context. However, visual sociology – theoretically at least – includes the study of all kinds of visual material and the visual social world, and uses all kinds of visual material in its methodologies.

Similarly, the newly formed British Sociological Association Visual Sociology Study Group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visualsociology.org|title=IVSA|website=International Visual Sociology Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers UK-based researchers and academics working in a broad range of sub-disciplines within sociological fields a network in which to explore existing and emerging visual research methods and methodologies.

==Theory and method==
There are at least three approaches to doing visual sociology:

===Data collection using cameras and other recording technology===
In this context, the camera is analogous to a [[tape recorder]].  [[Film camera|Film]] and [[video camera]]s are particularly well suited as data gathering technologies for [[experiment]]s and small group interactions, classroom studies, [[ethnography]], [[participant observation]], [[oral history]], the use of [[urban design|urban space]], etc.  The tape recorder captures things that are not preserved in even the best researchers' field notes.  Similarly, tape recordings preserve audible data not available in even the most carefully annotated transcripts: [[timbre]], the music of a voice, inflection, intonation, grunts and groans, pace, and space convey meanings easily (mis)understood but not easily gleaned from written words alone.  By opening another channel of information, visual recordings preserve still more information.  For instance, the raised eyebrow, the wave of a hand, the blink of an eye might convert the apparent meaning of words into their opposite, convey [[irony]], [[sarcasm]], or [[contradiction]].  So, regardless of how one analyzes the data or what is done with the visual record, sociologists can use cameras to record and preserve data of interest so it can be studied in detail.

Visual recording technology also allows us to manipulate the data.  Visual recordings have long been employed by natural [[scientists]] because they make it possible to speed up, slow down, repeat, stop, and zoom in on things of interest.  It is the same in the social sciences, recordings facilitate the study of phenomena that are too fast, or too slow, or too infrequent or too big or too small to study directly "in the life."  Most importantly, through editing visual sociologists can juxtapose events to produce meanings.  Sociologists may also be able to put cameras in places where one would not put a researcher: where it is dangerous, or where a person would be unwelcome, or simply to remove the observer effect from particular situations, e.g., studying social behavior among school children on a playground.

[[Photo elicitation]] is another technique of data gathering.  This methodological tool is a combination of photography as the visual equivalent of a tape recorder, and ethnography or other qualitative methods.  Photo elicitation techniques involve using photographs or film as part of the interview—in essence asking research subjects to discuss the meaning of photographs, films or videos.  In this case the images can be taken specially by the researcher with the idea of using them to elicit information, they can belong to the subject, for example family photographs or movies, or they can be gathered from other sources including archives, newspaper and television morgues, or corporate collections.  Typically the interviewee's comments or analysis of the visual material is itself recorded, either on audio tape or video, etc.

[[Photo voice]] is a related research method in which researchers give those being studied still or movie cameras. Research participants are taught to use the image making technology but are then responsible for making photos or movies which are subsequently analyzed either by the researchers or the participants, or both.

In any case, in this first sense visual sociology means including and incorporating visual methods of data gathering and analysis in the work of sociology. This method has recently been transferred to other academic disciplines, notably having been pioneered in contemporary religious research.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Sarah Dunlop ''Values and Significance: A case study exploring the search for meaning among young people in Eastern and Central Europe'', a paper given at the [http://www.socrel.org.uk BSA Sociology of Religion Study Group] [http://www.socrel.org.uk/conferences/Birmingham%202008/Final%20Programme%202008.pdf Annual Conference 2008 'Religion and Youth'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820012555/http://www.socrel.org.uk/conferences/Birmingham%202008/Final%20Programme%202008.pdf |date=2008-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Sarah Dunlop "[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1847996698 Visualising Hope]." published 2008 by [http://www.ytcpress.com YTC Press].&lt;/ref&gt; Visual sociology has also been employed as a useful tool to 'make the familiar strange' and can be a particularly effective research approach for working with children and marginalised groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://qrj.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/10/1/91|title= Mannay, D 2010.

http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1472586X.2013.801635&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studying visual data produced by cultures===
Visual sociology attempts to study visual images produced as part of culture.  [[Art]], [[photographs]], [[film]], [[video]], [[fonts]], [[advertisements]], [[Icon (computing)|computer icons]], [[landscape]], [[architecture]], [[machines]], [[fashion]], [[makeup]], [[hair style]], [[facial expressions]], [[tattoos]], and so on are parts of the complex [[visual communication]] system produced by members of societies.  The use and understanding of visual images is governed by socially established symbolic codes.  Visual images are constructed and may be deconstructed.  They may be read as texts in a variety of ways.  They can be analyzed with techniques developed in diverse fields of [[literary criticism]], [[art theory]] and criticism, [[content analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[deconstruction]]ism, or the more mundane tools of [[ethnography]].  Visual sociologists can categorize and count them; ask people about them; or study their use and the social settings in which they are produced and consumed.  So the second meaning of visual sociology is a discipline to study the visual products of society—their production, consumption and meaning.

===Communication with images and media other than words===
A third dimension of visual sociology is both the use of visual media to communicate sociological understandings to professional and public audiences, and also the use of visual media within sociological research itself.

In this context, visual sociology draws on the work of [[Edward Tufte]], whose books ''Envisioning Information'' and ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information'' address the communication of quantitative information.  Visual sociology considers the logics of presentation of sociological and anthropological documentarians and ethnographers like [[Robert Flaherty]], [[Konrad Lorenz]], [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Gregory Bateson]], and [[Frederick Wiseman]].  Visual sociology also requires the development of new forms—for example, data driven computer graphics to represent complex relationships e.g., changing social networks over time, the [[primitive accumulation of capital]], the flow of labor, relations between theory and practice.
