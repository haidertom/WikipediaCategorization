      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2272">An '''aretology''' (from ancient Greek [[arete (moral virtue)|aretê]], "excellence, virtue") in the strictest sense is a narrative about a divine figure's miraculous deeds. In the [[Greco-Roman world]], aretologies represent a religious branch of [[rhetoric]] and are a prose development of the [[hymn]] as praise poetry. [[Asclepius]], [[Isis]], and [[Serapis]] are among the deities with surviving aretologies in the form of [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] and [[papyri]].&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Pernot, ''Rhetoric in Antiquity,'' translated by W.E. Higgins (Catholic University of America Press, 2005), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek ''aretologos'' (ἀρετολόγος, "virtue-speaker") was a temple official who recounted aretologies and may have also interpreted dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Walter, ''The Warrior Saints in Byzantine Art and Tradition'' (Ashgate, 2003), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension, an aretology is also a "catalogue of virtues" belonging to a person; for example, [[Cicero]]'s list and description of the virtues of [[Pompey the Great|Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great")]] in the speech ''[[Pro Lege Manilia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Rees, "Panegyric," in "''A Companion to Roman Rhetoric'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Aretology became part of the Christian rhetorical tradition of [[hagiography]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter, ''The Warrior Saints,'' p. 17; Alistair Stewart-Sykes, ''From Prophecy to Preaching: A Search for the Origins of the Christian Homily'' (Brill, 2001), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an even more expanded sense, aretology is [[moral philosophy]] which deals with [[virtue]], its nature, and the means of arriving at it.{{cn|date=December 2012}} It is the title of an ethical tract by [[Robert Boyle]] published in the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Harwood, ''The Early Essays and Ethics of Robert Boyle'' (Southern Illinois University Press, 1991), p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Antennas|techniques}}

'''Beam tilt''' is used in [[radio]] to aim the main [[Side lobe|lobe]] of the  [[vertical plane]] [[radiation pattern]] of an antenna below (or above) the [[horizontal plane]].

The simplest way is mechanical beam tilt, where the antenna is physically mounted in such a manner as to lower the angle of the signal on one side.  However, this also raises it on the other side, making it useful in only very limited situations.

[[Image:sector antenna radiation pattern.png|left|thumb|250px|Horizontal and vertical radiation patterns, the latter with a pronounced downward beam tilt]]

More common is electrical beam tilt, where the [[phase shifting|phasing]] between antenna elements is tweaked to make the signal go down (usually) in all directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rwonline.com/article/4374|title=Overshoots and Close-In Coverage|last=Alexander|first=W.C.|date=6 November 2002|publisher=[[Radio World]]|accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is extremely useful when the [[Antenna (electronics)|antenna]] is at a very high point, and the edge of the signal is likely to miss the target (broadcast audience, cellphone users, etc.) entirely.

With electrical tilting, front and back lobes tilt in same direction : for example, an electrical downtilt will make both front lobe and back lobe tilt down. This is the property used in the above example where the signal is pointed down in all directions. On the contrary, mechanical downtilting will make the front lobe tilt down and the back lobe tilt up. In almost all practical cases, antennas are only tilted down - though tilting up is technically possible.

A vertical antenna being less visible than a mechanically tilted one, the use of purely electrical tilt with no mechanical tilt is an attractive choice for aesthetic reasons which are very important for operators seeking acceptance of integrated antennas in visible locations.

In GSM and UMTS cellular networks, mechanical tilt is almost always fixed whereas electrical tilt can be controlled using remote actuators and position sensors, thus reducing operating expenses. Remote electrical tilt is abbreviated as RET and it is part of the [http://www.aisg.org.uk Antenna Interface Standards Group]'s [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720194041/http://www.torni.fi/aisg/AISG%20v2.0%20.pdf open specification for the control interface of antenna devices].

Occasionally, the mechanical and electrical tilt will be used together for odd situations, in order to create greater beam tilt in one direction than the other, mainly to accommodate unusual [[terrain]].  Along with [[null fill]], beam tilt is the essential parameter controlling the focus of [[radio]] [[communication]]s, and together they can create almost infinite combinations of 3-D [[radiation pattern]]s for any situation.

'''CLEAPSS''' is an advisory service providing support in [[science]] and [[technology]] for a consortium of [[local authorities]] and their schools including establishments for pupils with [[special needs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About CLEAPSS|url=http://www.cleapss.org.uk/about-cleapss|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Independent school]]s, post-16 colleges, teacher training establishments, curriculum developers and others can apply for associate membership. CLEAPSS offers help from nursery education through to A-level studies or equivalent.

CLEAPSS first started in 1963 as '''CLEAPSE''' (Consortium of Local Education Authorities for the Provision of Science Equipment). In 1988 the name was changed to CLEAPSS ('''Consortium of Local Education Authorities for the Provision of Science Services''') to reflect a change of emphasis from equipment to a range of services. Since then, [[Local Education Authorities]] became Local Authorities (LAs) and CLEAPSS' services expanded to include [[D&amp;T]], so CLEAPSS was registered as a [[Trade Mark]]. CLEAPSS is now simply a name and not an acronym.

CLEAPSS is based at the [[Brunel University]] Science Park in [[Uxbridge]].

A '''canopy seed bank''' or '''aerial seed bank''' is the aggregate of viable [[seed]] stored by a [[plant]] in its [[canopy (biology)|canopy]]. Canopy seed banks occur in plants that postpone seed release for some reason.

It is often associated with [[serotiny]], the tendency of some plants to store seed in a [[Conifer cone|cone]] (e.g. in the genus ''[[Pinus]]'') or woody fruits (e.g. in the genus ''[[Banksia]]''), until seed release is triggered by the passage of a [[wildfire]].

It also occurs in plants that colonise areas of shifting sands such as sand dunes. In such cases, the seed is held in the canopy even if the canopy becomes buried; thus the seed is anchored in place until good germination conditions occur.

'''Civil Affairs''' ('''CA''') is a term used by both the United Nations and by military institutions (such as the US military), but for different purposes in each case.

==Civil Affairs in United Nations Peace Operations==
Civil affairs officers in UN peace operations are civilian staff members who are often at the forefront of a mission’s interaction with local government officials, civil society, and other civilian partners in the international community. "Civil Affairs components work at the social, administrative and sub-national political levels to facilitate the countrywide implementation of peacekeeping mandates and to support the population and government in strengthening conditions and structures conducive to sustainable peace.",&lt;ref&gt;DPKO/DFS Policy Directive on Civil Affairs (April 2008)http://www.peacekeepingbestpractices.unlb.org/pbps/Library/DPKO-DFS%20Policy%20Directive%20on%20Civil%20Affairs.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil affairs components are deployed in most peacekeeping missions led by the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations and are also a feature of many special political missions led by the Department of Political Affairs. Civil Affairs 
Officers are usually deployed at the local level, where they serve as the link between the UN mission and local authorities and communities. Civil affairs components work countrywide to strengthen the social and civic conditions necessary to consolidate peace processes and are a core function of multi-dimensional peacekeeping operations. As of mid-2013, there were approximately 700 Civil Affairs Officers in 13 UN Peacekeeping Operations worldwide.

Civil Affairs components perform one or more of three core roles, depending on the UN Security Council mandate given to a particular peacekeeping mission. In each role the work of Civil Affairs intersects with, supports and draws upon the work of a variety of other actors. Depending on the mandate, the three core roles are 1) Cross-mission representation, monitoring and facilitation at the local level; 2) Confidence-building, conflict management and support to reconciliation; and 3) Support to the restoration and extension of state authority.

===The roots of Civil Affairs in UN Peace Operations===

There were precursors for what was later termed civil affairs in Central America and in Cambodia during the 1991 to 1993 period. For example, the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC)’s civil administration component was responsible for the supervision of administrative structures in Cambodia, ranging from public security to finance and information.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Durch, UN Peacekeeping, American Policy and the Uncivil Wars of the 1990s
(Henry L. Stimson Center, 1996) and Steven R. Ratner, The New UN Peacekeeping: 
Building Peace in Lands of Conflict after the Cold War (St. Martin’s Press, 1995), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first component known officially as ”civil affairs” was formed in 1992, with the United Nations Protection Force  (UNPROFOR)’s mandate in the former Yugoslavia.

The development and growth of civil affairs work has been a critical element of the development and growth of multidimensional peace operations. With the end of the cold war and the increase in peace operations required to respond to intra-state 
conflict, the UN was increasingly asked to tackle complex civilian tasks. These went beyond the quite limited role of liaising with political actors and the “good offices” work that had characterized civilian peacekeepers until that point. Cedric Thornberry, the first Director of Civil Affairs in a UN mission (UNPROFOR in 1992), described this new broader role as follows:

''To fully understand the UN’s meaning of “civil affairs” it is first important to appreciate that most of the missions created between 1989 and 1992, especially, were qualitatively different from those which had preceded. It is not just that most were a lot bigger … they were to fulfil many roles  additional to the archetypal ones of the 1947-1988 period. The task of the UN 
became, not merely to observe, but actively, itself, to bring about peace […] In a rapid sequence of major operations – principally in Namibia, Central America and Cambodia – the UN was required not only to make peace, but to conduct nationwide processes of reconstruction and national reconciliation. Their task was, in broad terms, to harmonize or unify deeply divided societies, long racked by war, and to establish democracy where previously there had been tyranny.''&lt;ref&gt;Cedric Thornberry, ”Civil affairs in the development ofUNpeacekeeping”, International Peacekeeping, 
vol. 1, No. 4 (1994), pp. 471– 484.&lt;/ref&gt;

These key themes of helping to unify divided societies and helping states to exert legitimate authority are central to the continuing role of civil affairs today.

During the 1990s small civil affairs components were included in a number of missions, including those in Cyprus, Tajikistan and Georgia. At the end of that decade, major civil affairs components were deployed to Kosovo and East Timor, to implement the 
executive mandates that were given to peacekeeping operations at that time. In these cases civil affairs components found themselves mandated to establish effective administrations and to support capacity-building for self-government.

The start of the 2000s saw a surge in the deployment of large civil affairs components to peacekeeping missions. Each one had its own unique focus and contribution to make in implementing peace mandates at the local level, but each was there to 
strengthen links to ordinary citizens, as well as to support the development of social conditions conducive to peace and provide an overall facilitation role locally.

===Civil Affairs into the Next Decade===

In 2008, for the first time, the UN Departments of Peacekeeping Operations and Field Support developed and disseminated a policy directive that defines and conceptualizes the diverse work of civil affairs. This has provided the foundation for the development of this Handbook, as well as training and recruitment profiles to ensure that civil affairs components are strong, well-trained and well planned, ready to address the challenges ahead.

This institutional framework will need to continue to evolve and develop in response to analysis of the ongoing shifts in the global security environment. The World Bank's World Development Report 2011, for example, found that many countries are caught in a mutually reinforcing cycle of violence and poverty. It also found that more and more people are suffering from violence that is linked to lack of governance and rule of law, rather than to outright war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTWDRS/0,,contentMDK:23252415~pagePK:478093~piPK:477627~theSitePK:477624,00.html|title=World Development Report 2011 — Conflict, Security, and Development|year=2011|website=web.worldbank.org|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes in the global security environment have resulted in mandates increasingly requiring higher levels of civilian engagement on a wide variety of thematic and cross-cutting issues, ranging from governance, rule 
of law and institution-building through to early peacebuilding and protection of civilians from threats of violence.

For peacekeeping, of particular note among these emerging issues is the protection of civilians, which has increasingly become a major part of the international discourse around intervention. This was demonstrated in the international dialogue on both 
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Côte d'Ivoire in early 2011 and earlier in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Darfur. Protection of civilians has also increasingly become a specific mandated task, after inclusion in eight UN peacekeeping mandates by the Security Council. It can be expected that civil affairs will be at the forefront of an integrated and coordinated approach to mandate delivery on this issue, in terms of civilian and government engagement on the ground.

Meanwhile, as many peacekeeping operations mandated as part of a surge during the 2000s are starting to draw down their military presence, the UN continues to evolve, transitioning towards an increased focus on the civilian dimension of ”peacebuilding” and its role in avoidance of a return to conflict. Here, civil affairs has a key role to play – 
within both peacekeeping and political missions – by ensuring that efforts to mitigate conflict drivers and to engage and support local government and communities have meaning on the ground outside the capitals in which the UN is deployed. A continued focus on local presence in these contexts is key if the UN is to ensure that its work genuinely responds to the priorities and concerns of ordinary citizens within postconflict countries, thereby helping to ensure their consent and to create durable conditions for peace.

These evolving roles, and the range of partners working in related fields and capacities, all create the need – and potential – for increased partnership and cooperation, to ensure that mandate aims progress effectively. Similarly, as these complex and 
multidimensional trends for the UN response to conflict emerge, the identification and provision of appropriate and available resources to respond to them effectively must also evolve. As indicated in the report of the Senior Advisory Group on Civilian 
capacity in the aftermath of conflict,&lt;ref&gt;(A/65/747—S/2011/85); http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/resources/reports.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; these challenges will require a nimble, harmonized and, where necessary, specialized civilian response, as well as a focus on partnership across organizations such as the World Bank, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and regional organizations such as the African Union (AU).

One of the major issues identified in the review of civilian capacities is the need to be able to better identify and support national capacities. As the review states: “The United Nations has seen success in humanitarian operations and peacekeeping, built on a strong partnership with Member States. But the international community has had less success in supporting and enabling the national capacities that are essential for an enduring peace.”19 Civil affairs components have a key role to play in identifying and supporting national capacities, within civil society and local government, including through helping to ensure that voices from the local level are heard in nationally led peacebuilding processes.

Overall, in the evolving environment of international peace and security, a key asset of civil affairs components is their agility and their capacity to respond flexibly to the wide range of demands and expectations within Security Council mandates. 
One aspect of this flexibility is their ability to direct their focus depending on the availability and presence of other international partners at the local level, particularly those with expertise in highly specialized areas. Civil affairs can play an important role in mobilizing these partners in places and at times where they are most needed. This is a cost-efficient model, given the prohibitive and unnecessary expense of having a full complement of specialized expertise available in each locality around the country at all times. It also helps to ensure that local-level support is need-driven, rather than simply 
provided because a particular service or resource happens to be available.

Civil affairs can be expected to remain at the forefront of the UN response to conflict, and to building the processes, structures, relationships and trust required to assist countries and communities to break the cycle of violence.

===Core Role 1: Cross-mission representation, monitoring and facilitation at the local level===

Cross-mission representation, monitoring and facilitation are performed in most missions and usually throughout the life cycle of the mission. In many situations civil affairs is the most important interface between the UN mission and the community, 
not just in terms of the local/regional authorities but also civil society in its broadest sense. Through its multiple interactions with the local population, civil affairs provides the mission with the pulse of the nation beyond the high-level contacts with government and political party leadership. This helps to nuance the mission’s understanding of the sociopolitical climate, allowing analysis to move beyond the carefully articulated positions of national spokespeople and representatives, and to ensure that regional and local considerations are integrated into national negotiations or priority-setting processes.

In return, local communities and groups have an opportunity through civil affairs to access the mission, which they may perceive as distant and militarized. Civil affairs can be a bridge, which means that groups who previously would not have dared to approach the heavily guarded mission gates and ask for a discussion with the mission field leadership, civilian or military, can now approach the UN as guests rather than supplicants. The mission is inevitably enriched by this kind of dialogue and Civil Affairs Officers are often the best facilitators of it.

===Core Role 2: Conflict management, confidence-building and support to the development of political space===

Conflict management, confidence-building and supporting the development of political space are integral to UN peacekeeping and central to civil affairs work. Through this role, civil affairs actively supports the development of social and civic 
conditions conducive to sustainable peace, and promotes popular engagement and confidence in the peace process. While often the lead component in this area of work, civil affairs usually undertakes these activities in partnership with other mission components, as well as UN agencies and local and international partners. Within the mission, police and military components and other civilian components, such as political affairs, public information and human rights, may all contribute in one way or another to objectives in this area.

===Core Role 3: Support to the restoration and extension of state authority===

Restoration of state authority is increasingly recognized as a key element of the stabilization of fragile states and a critical requirement for keeping and building peace. This is clearly reflected in many of the recent UN Security Council resolutions including, for example, Security Council resolution 1974 (2011), which calls for the Government of Afghanistan “to improve governance” and “to pursue continued legislative and public administration reform in order to ensure good governance”. In the case of Haiti, meanwhile, Security Council resolution 1892 (2009) “calls upon MINUSTAH, consistent with its mandate, to continue such support to strengthen self-sustaining state institutions, especially outside Port-au-Prince, including through the provision of specialized expertise to key ministries and institutions”.

In exceptional circumstances, the Security Council has also authorized peacekeeping missions to temporarily assume the administrative and legislative functions of the state through provision of a transitional administration, as was the case in Kosovo and TimorLeste. However, it is important to emphasize the specificity of the circumstances under which these two missions were established and the fact that executive mandates are generally seen as a last resort in situations where a territory is virtually deprived of any functioning state institutions.

According to the [[U.S. Army]], "Civil Affairs units help military commanders by working with civil authorities and civilian populations in the commander’s area of operations to lessen the impact of military operations on them during peace, contingency operations and declared war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bragg.army.mil/sorb/CA_what_is_CA.htm/ |title=What is Civil Affairs? |author=U.S. Army |date=1 June 2011 |accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With their expertise in civil matters, they are the principal unit in assisting a commander in the conduct of [[civil-military operations]].

CA units act as a liaison between the civilian inhabitants of a warzone or disaster area and the military presence, both informing the local commander of the status of the civilian populace as well as effecting assistance to locals by either coordinating military operations with [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) and IGO's or distributing directly aid and supplies.

Consisting primarily of civilian experts such as doctors, lawyers, engineers, police, firemen, bankers, computer programmers, farmers, and others, CA soldiers provide critical expertise to host-nation governments and are also able to assess need for critical infrastructure projects such as roads, clinics, schools, power plants, water treatment facilities, etc. Once a project has been decided on, a contract is put out at a [[civil-military operations center]] for local contractors to come and bid. CA teams will periodically check up on the status of the project to make sure the money is being well-spent.

CA provides the commander with cultural expertise, assesses the needs of the civilian populace, handles civilians on the battlefield, refugee operations, keeps the commander informed of protected targets such as schools, churches, hospitals, etc., and interfaces with local and international NGOs and private volunteer organizations, which provides the commander with a unique battlefield overlay of all civilian activity, ongoing infrastructure projects, and the presence and mission of NGOs in the area.

===History of US military civil affairs===
{{Main|History of Civil Affairs}}
Throughout U.S. history the U.S. Army was involved in Civil Affairs and [[Civic action program|civic action]]. Civil Affairs has its origins in military governments that were and are established when a country is occupied during war.

===United States Army===

96% of the civil affairs personnel come from the [[United States Army Reserve]] and usually support active duty Army units. Using reservists allows military commanders to utilize skills of soldiers with experience in professions needed to manage and restore civilian areas impacted by military operations.  This includes lawyers, city managers, economists, veterinarians, teachers, policemen, and other occupations who have valuable skills in restoration of governance and essential services in a war torn area. As a result, they deploy with certifications and experiences that become difficult to duplicate by the active duty forces. Additionally, reserve civil affairs planners attend the stability, security, and development in complex operations course taught at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.

Reserve civil affairs units assigned to [[United States Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command]] (Airborne) are task organized in four reserve civil affairs commands (CACOMs) which integrate at the strategic and operational level with theater commands and joint/combined task forces. Civil affairs brigades comprise these CACOMS and integrate at the corps. At the tactical level, maneuver divisions are augmented by the civil affairs battalions. The four CACOMs are the [[350th Civil Affairs Command|350th CACOM]], the [[351st Civil Affairs Command|351st CACOM]], the [[352nd Civil Affairs Command|352nd CACOM]], and the [[353rd Civil Affairs Command|353rd CACOM]].

Two other Army Reserve civil affairs units are assigned to other theaters of operation.  The 322nd Civil Affairs Brigade is based in Hawaii and falls under operational control of United States Army Pacific Command and the 9th Mission Support Command.  The 361st Civil Affairs Brigade is based in Germany and falls under operational control of United States Army Europe and the 7th Civil Support Command.

====Active Duty Civil Affairs====
The remaining 4% of civil affairs personnel are active component soldiers assigned to the [[95th Civil Affairs Brigade]], the 85th Civil Affairs Brigade or Army Theater, Corps, Division and Brigade G9/S9 positions. Active component civil affairs soldiers are civil affairs generalists, selected from around the Army.

The [[95th Civil Affairs Brigade]] and its five subordinate battalions are all stationed at [[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]], [[North Carolina]], which is a rapidly deployable unit that only supports the Army Special Operations Command.  Each of the five battalions is regionally aligned to one of the five U.S. combatant commands; SOUTHCOM, CENTCOM, EUCOM, AFRICOM and PACOM.  The civil affairs soldiers in these units receive formal language and regional instruction as part of their qualification course and are assigned to the battalion affiliated with the respective region they are trained for. Once these soldiers arrive to their assigned units they receive advance training in a variety of fields, making them the spearhead of Civil Affairs Units in the Army.

The 85th Civil Affairs Brigade,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hood.army.mil/85thCA/ 85th Civil Affairs Brigade]&lt;/ref&gt; Fort Hood, Texas, activated in 2011 but later deactivated in 2017, provided direct support to Active Component Conventional Forces and fell under the command of [[United States Army Forces Command]]. 
The brigade had five subordinate battalions stationed across the continental United States.  The brigade headquarters and one battalion (81st Civil Affairs Battalion) were co-located at Ft. Hood, Texas. The other battalions were located at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina (83rd Civil Affairs Battalion) and Ft. Stewart, Georgia (82nd Civil Affairs Battalion). Previously, the brigade had two additional battalions at Fort Bliss, Texas (80th) and Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington (84th) which were deactivated summer 2016. The 83rd Civil Affairs battalion will remain activated and will fall under the 16th Military Police Brigade for administrative purposes at Fort Bragg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dolasinski|first1=Amanda|title=Civil affairs battalion to remain at Fort Bragg|url=http://www.fayobserver.com/news/20171001/civil-affairs-battalion-to-remain-at-fort-bragg|accessdate=15 January 2018|publisher=The Fayetteville Observer|date=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, a civil affairs battalion of any component will contain a headquarters company, and one civil affairs company for each maneuver brigade (four to six civil affairs tactical companies). Each civil affairs company contains civil affairs teams (known as CATs) which integrate at the maneuver battalion level. There will usually be one civil affairs team per maneuver battalion. In this manner, the division will have operational control over a civil affairs battalion, a brigade will have operational control over a civil affairs company and an infantry battalion will have tactical control over a civil affairs team. The civil affairs battalion retains administrative control for its elements deployed in theater.

The civil affairs battalion and its subordinate companies and teams become organic parts of their maneuver unit, augmenting the unit's S-9 or G-9 Civil Military Operations Cell, providing cultural expertise, functional specialty expertise, direct support tactical civil affairs, and establishing civil-military operations centers (known as CMOCs, CIMICs or CMCCs, depending on the doctrine in use) and [[Provincial Reconstruction Team]]s for the geographic area the maneuver unit is responsible for.

{{Main|United States Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command}}
Within the United States Army, reserve civil affairs units are administered through [[United States Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command]] (Airborne), or USACAPOC(A), a subordinate of [[U.S. Army Reserve Command]]. USACAPOC(A) contains [[Psychological Operations]] (PO) and Civil Affairs (CA) units, consisting of Army Reserve elements. USACAPOC(A) was founded in 1985. It is headquartered at [[Fort Bragg, North Carolina]].

On 1 October 2006, USACAPOC(A) realigned from the United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) to the United States Army Reserve Command (USARC). Training and doctrine relating to USACAPOC(A) is provided by the United States Army John Fitzgerald Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (USAJFKSWCS) at Fort Bragg, NC.

=====US Army civil affairs training=====
* Reserve Civil Affairs
**Initial Entry Training (IET)
Upon completion of [[United States Army Basic Training|basic training]], a Soldier slotted in a Civil Affairs Unit will attend the 10-week Civil Affairs Advanced Individual Training (AIT) course. The 3rd Battalion of the 1st Special Warfare Training Group (Airborne) is responsible for the training. Both Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations trainees are assigned to Alpha Company. Upon completion of the 10-week course, (the original 13-week course was lengthened to 15 weeks in 2008, then shortened to 10 weeks in 2010) the student will be able to interpret U.S. and foreign maps; conduct civil, governmental, humanitarian, and defense assistance; apply organizational and leadership skills required in field operations; and conduct research on documents and other aspects of urban and regional studies. The instruction is conducted by lecture, discussion, and practical exercises such as map reading, land navigation, communications, and civil affairs planning.
* Reserve enlisted soldiers who reclassify to Civil Affairs must attend the Civil Affairs Reclassification Course which is offered at several posts throughout the country. Currently, training for combat, combat support, and combat service support is organized through regional training commands. The six Civil Affairs schoolhouses report to the 3rd Brigade (CA/PO) [[100th Infantry Division (United States)|100th Division]], located at [[Fort Totten (New York)|Fort Totten]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. These units are the 5th Battalion (CA), 95th Regiment, of [[Lubbock]], [[Texas]]; 5th Battalion (CA), 98th Regiment of [[Fort Dix]], [[New Jersey]]; the 12th Battalion (CA), 100th Regiment of [[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]]; the 4th Battalion (CA), 104th Regiment, of [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], [[California (U.S. state)|California]]; 108th Regiment of [[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]], [[North Carolina]].

The [[American Council on Education]] recommends [[Course credit|college credit]] be awarded in the lower-division [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] or [[associate's degree]] category two semester hours in [[map]]-reading, three in [[public administration]], and one in [[military science]] for this training. The soldier is awarded the [[United States military occupation codes|Military Occupational Specialty]] designation of 38B10. All [[Active duty|Active Component]] enlisted will attend airborne school and language school, while Reservists attend these courses at a later date through their units.

* Active Duty Forces via Branch Transfer
** Active Component enlisted Soldiers and officers in the rank of [[sergeant]] and [[staff sergeant]] or 1LT and CPT who have a valid [[security clearance]] are considered by attending a rigorous selection course at Camp MacKall, NC. Those soldiers selected to reclassify to Civil Affairs must attend the 48-week Qualification Course (CA SPEC). During this course, Soldiers learn to prepare, execute, and transition CA core tasks, CA operations (CAO), and civil-military operations (CMO). Training is mission-oriented and encompasses language and culture to include the Special Operations Language Training, allowing for maximum hands-on use of CAO/CMO doctrinal procedures during practical exercises (PEs) and a culminating exercise (CULEX) that exposes students to realistic operational situations and environmental elements.  Follow on courses often include Special Operations Medic Course, airborne, SERE-C, interagency planning, additional language training, weapons courses, off road mobility courses, and others.

The training conducted is offered over an abbreviated period of four weeks. Newly enlisted Civil Affairs Soldiers attend a fast-paced 13-week course, which includes land navigation training (mounted and dismounted), weapons training (rifle and pistol), [[night vision device]] training, negotiations training and an extensive field training exercise held at [[Camp Mackall]], North Carolina, located 50 miles outside of Fort Bragg. As of 2005, only one of 10 Soldiers that enlisted in the Army qualified for Civil Affairs/Psychological Operations MOS. Since 2008, the drill sergeants that made the AIT one of the toughest in the United States Army, have been no longer a part of the AIT course (the AIT course did not fall under normal [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command|Training and Doctrine Command]] (TRADOC) commands like every other AIT). Students must complete the Nasty Nick (Special Forces) Obstacle Course before graduation.
* Officer training
Civil Affairs is a branch for both active duty and reserve officers.  In the past, active duty officers were only awarded a functional area while reserve component received a reclassification to civil affairs branch upon completion of all training.

Active duty officers, upon completion of Civil Affairs Assessment and Selection, must attend airborne school if not already qualified, and the Captain's Career Course and the Civil Affairs Qualification Course (CAQC) on Fort Bragg, NC.  Officers must be of a certain year group prior to being allowed to apply to attend Civil Affairs training and, in general, will have reached the rank of Captain prior to attending the CAQC.

The qualification course is approximately one year long consisting of language training, culture training, and MOS specific training.  Following graduation, officers are assigned to the [[95th Civil Affairs Brigade (United States)|95th Civil Affairs Brigade (Airborne)]] or to the 85th Civil Affairs Brigade. Reserve Component officers are assigned directly to a Reserve Civil Affairs unit and attend language training, Airborne school, and other military schools through their home station unit.

===United States Marine Corps===
The Marine Corps currently has four permanent CA units: [[1st Civil Affairs Group]] (1st CAG), [[2nd Civil Affairs Group|2nd CAG]], [[3rd Civil Affairs Group|3d CAG]] and [[4th Civil Affairs Group|4th CAG]], all in the [[Force Headquarters Group]] of the [[Marine Forces Reserve]]. 5th and 6th CAGs were created provisionally in 2005-06 for [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]], but each were stood down after one deployment to Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Marines magazine.

===United States Navy===
{{main|Maritime Civil Affairs and Security Training Command}}
The [[Navy Expeditionary Combat Command]] (NECC) officially established its newest command, Maritime Civil Affairs Group (MCAG) during a ceremony at [[Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek]] on 30 March 2007. In an effort to consolidate staffs and resources, CNO Notice 5400 of 9 July 2009 redesignated MCAG and Expeditionary Training Groups as [[Maritime Civil Affairs and Security Training Command|Maritime Civil Affairs and Security Training (MCAST) Command]] and relocated the command to [[Virginia Beach]].  MCAST Command officially stood up 1 October 2009.

Maritime Civil Affairs Teams (MCATs) lessen the impact of military operations imposed during peace and periods of [[Declaration of war|declared war]], and increase the impact of [[humanitarian civil assistance]] (HCA) and contingency operations in support of theater security cooperation plans.

MCA forces provide assistance with the restoration of local infrastructure in the aftermath of military operations, natural and man-made disasters and regional engagement activities in order to achieve shared mutual interests.

In order to maximize its effectiveness, each deployed MCAT is regionally focused and trained with the necessary language skills and cultural awareness. The teams are responsible for streamlining and coordinating the efforts of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], and the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID).

Each Maritime Civil Affairs sailor is responsible for shaping the regional perception of the U.S. and gaining the support of the local populace, preventing it from being influenced by forces of instability, such as terrorism, piracy, crime and natural disaster.

===United States Air Force===
The Air Force has deployed united in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom that have directly integrated into Army Civil Affairs Battalions. Such units include the 16th Squadron, 732nd Expeditionary Air Wing (Civil Affairs/Public Works) which was assigned to the [[411th Civil Affairs Battalion (United States)|411th Civil Affairs Battalion]]. During the 402nd Civil Affairs BN deployment to Iraq in April 2006 to April 2007, members of the United States Air Force provided Airman for logistical support for HHC and for the Provincial Reconstruction Teams throughout their area of operations.

===Other organizations===

====New York State Guard====
In the [[New York State Guard]], one of approximately 25 states with [[state defense force]]s, (not to be confused with the New York [[Army National Guard]]), the term 'Civil Affairs' has a slightly different connotation. The Civil Affairs units include lawyers, judges, engineers, doctors and other professionals and paraprofessionals committed to voluntary, part-time military service in support of the New York National Guard and U.S. Military Reserve Units from all branches. When soldiers are called up for duty, the New York Guard makes sure their legal needs are attended to so that they can serve with the peace of mind of knowing that their affairs are in order. Civil Affairs soldiers draft their wills, prepare powers of attorney and other necessary documents, and advise them of their rights as soldiers under federal law and as citizens of the United States. There are five units, one in each brigade of the Guard, including the 5th Civil Affairs Regiment, Yonkers, NY; 7th Civil Affairs Regiment, New York City, NY; 13th Civil Affairs Regiment, Garden City, NY; 23rd Civil Affairs Regiment, Latham, NY; and the 209th Civil Affairs Regiment, Buffalo, NY.

==Civil affairs worldwide==

===United Kingdom===
The [[British Army]] has a Civil Affairs Group, formed in 1997 and consisting primarily of [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] personnel. Most personnel are members of the [[Royal Engineers]] and the group is administered by the Central Volunteer Headquarters Royal Engineers (CVHQ RE), based at [[Gibraltar Barracks, Minley|Gibraltar Barracks]], in [[Minley]], [[Surrey]]. Members of the group have been deployed operationally in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo]], [[Albania]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[East Timor]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].  In Afghanistan, the tactical level unit was called Military Stabilisation Support Team, and they usually worked for the [[Provincial Reconstruction Team]].

The British Army first formed CA units in 1943, and by August 1944 there were 3,600 CA personnel in [[France]] with the [[British 21st Army Group|21st Army Group]].

===The Netherlands===
The [[Royal Netherlands Army]]'s Civil Affairs unit is 1 [[CIMIC]] Battalion. The staff consist of regular soldiers. Other personnel are reservists with a civilian occupation. Members of the battalion have been deployed to [[Bosnia]]; [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]; [[Africa]] and [[Afghanistan]]. The unit is, as of early 2009, based in [[Apeldoorn]].

==Civil affairs in popular media==

To be a [[Sustainable living|climate-friendly]] [[gardener]] means considering both what happens in a garden and the materials brought into it and the impact they have on [[land use]] and [[climate]].&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sustainable Gardens |date=2009 |publisher=CSIRO |location=Collingwood, Australia |isbn=9780643094222 |first1=Rob |last1=Cross |first2=Roger |last2=Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardening"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sustainable Gardening |date=2011 |publisher=The Crowood Press |location=Marlborough |isbn=9781847972323 |first=Michael |last=Lavelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Land use and greenhouse gases ==

Most of the excess [[greenhouse gas]]es causing [[climate change]] have come from burning [[fossil fuel]]. But a special report from the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) estimated that in the last 150 years fossil fuels and [[Cement#CO2 emissions|cement production]] were responsible for only about two-thirds of climate change: the other third has been caused by human [[land use]].&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"&gt;{{cite book |title=Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report) |date=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=9780521800839 |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/land_use/index.php?idp=0 |first1=Robert T. |last1=Watson |first2=Ian R. |last2=Noble |first3=Bert |last3=Bolin |first4=N. H. |last4=Ravindranath |first5=David J. |last5=Verardo |first6=David J. |last6=Dokken}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three main greenhouse gases produced by [[unsustainable]] land use are [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], and [[nitrous oxide]].&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitigating Climate Change through Food and Land Use"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mitigating Climate Change through Food and Land Use |date=2009 |publisher=Worldwatch Institute |location=Washington, United States of America |isbn=9781878071910 |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/179%20Land%20Use.pdf |first1=Sara J. |last1=Scherr |first2=Sajal |last2=Sthapit}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Black carbon]] or [[soot]] can also be caused by unsustainable land use, and, although not a gas, can behave like greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change.&lt;ref name="Ullstein editor 2011"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Ullstein  |editor-first=Bart |title=Integrated Assessment of Black Carbon and Tropospheric Ozone:  Summary for Decision-Makers |date=2011 |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme and World Meteorological Organisation |isbn=978-92-807-3142-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bond 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bond |first1=T.

=== Carbon dioxide ===

[[Carbon dioxide]], {{CO2}}, is a natural part of the [[carbon cycle]], but human [[land use]]s often add more, especially from [[habitat destruction]] and the [[Tillage|cultivation]] of [[soil]]. When [[woodland]]s, [[wetland]]s, and other natural [[habitat]]s are turned into [[pasture]], [[Arable land|arable fields]], buildings and roads, the [[Soil carbon|carbon held in the soil]] and vegetation becomes extra carbon dioxide and [[methane]] to trap more heat in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]].&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"&gt;{{cite book |title=Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report) |date=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=9780521800839 |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/land_use/index.php?idp=0 |first1=Robert T. |last1=Watson |first2=Ian R. |last2=Noble |first3=Bert |last3=Bolin |first4=N. H. |last4=Ravindranath |first5=David J. |last5=Verardo |first6=David J. |last6=Dokken}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gardener]]s may cause extra carbon dioxide to be added to the atmosphere in several ways:

* Using [[peat]] or [[potting compost]] containing peat;&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Royal Horticultural Society |title=Peat and the Gardener: Conservation and Environment Guidelines |date=2009 |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society, Wisley, United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Alan |title=Towards Sustainable Growing Media: Chairman's Report and Roadmap |date=2013 |publisher=Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), London |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/221019/pb13867-towards-sustainable-growing-media.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=John |title=How to Create an Eco Garden: The Practical Guide to Greener, Planet-Friendly Gardening |date=2011 |publisher=Aquamarine |location=Wigston, Leicester |isbn=978-1903141892}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Buying [[garden furniture]] or other [[wood]]en products made from woodland which has been destroyed rather than taken as a [[Renewable resource|renewable crop]] from [[Sustainable land management|sustainably managed]] woodland;&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;
* Digging soil and leaving it bare so that the carbon in soil organic matter is [[Oxidation|oxidised]];&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;
* Using [[power tool]]s which burn [[fossil fuel]] or [[electricity]] generated by burning fossil fuel;&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecological Gardening"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cunningham |first=Sally |title=Ecological Gardening |date=2009 |publisher=The Crowood Press |location=Marlborough |isbn=978 1 84797 125 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using [[patio heater]]s;
* Heating [[greenhouse]]s by burning fossil fuel or electricity generated by burning fossil fuel;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;
* Burning [[Pruning|garden pruning]]s and [[weed]]s on a [[bonfire]];
* Buying [[tools]], [[pesticide]]s, [[Fertilizer|synthetic nitrogen fertilizers]] (over 2 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent is produced in the manufacture of each kilogram of ammonium nitrate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Sam |last1=Wood |first2=Annette  |last2=Cowie |title=A Review of Greenhouse Gas Emission Factors for Fertiliser Production |date=2004 |publisher=IEA Bioenergy}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and other materials which have been manufactured using fossil fuel;&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Julian Allwood and Jonathan Cullen 'Sustainable Materials - with both eyes open'"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sustainable Materials - with both eyes open |date=2011 |publisher=UIT |location=Cambridge |isbn=9781906860059 |url=http://www.withbotheyesopen.com/ |first1=Julian |last1=Allwood |first2=Jonathan |last2=Cullen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hammond |first=G.

Gardeners will also be responsible for extra carbon dioxide when they buy garden products which have been transported by vehicles powered by fossil fuel.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;

=== Methane ===
[[Methane]], CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, is a natural part of the [[carbon cycle]], but human [[land use]]s often add more, especially from [[:wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] [[soil]], artificial [[wetland]]s such as [[Rice#Environmental impacts|rice fields]], and from the [[Digestion|guts]] of [[livestock|farm animals]], especially [[ruminant]]s such as [[cattle]] and [[sheep]].&lt;ref name="Dave Reay 2010"&gt;{{cite book |title=Methane and Climate Change |date=2010 |publisher=Earthscan |location=London |isbn=978-1844078233 |first1=Dave |last1=Reay |first2=Pete |last2=Smith |first3=Andre |last3=van Amstel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gardener]]s may cause extra methane to be added to the atmosphere in several ways:

* [[Soil compaction|Compacting]] soil so that it becomes anaerobic, for example by treading on soil when it is wet;
* Allowing [[compost]] heaps to become compacted and anaerobic;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harriet Kopinska |author2=Jane Griffiths |author3=Heather Jackson |author4=Pauline Pears |title=The Garden Organic Book of Compost|date=2011|publisher=New Holland|location=London|isbn=9781847734372}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Creating homemade liquid feed by putting the leaves of plants such as [[Comfrey#Fertilizer uses|comfrey under water]], with the unintended consequence that the plants may release methane as they [[Decomposition|decay]];
* Killing pernicious [[weed]]s by covering them with water, with the unintended consequence that the plants may release methane as they decay;
* Allowing [[pond]]s to become anaerobic, for example by adding unsuitable [[fish]] species which stir up sediment that then blocks light from and kills [[Water aeration#Natural aeration|submerged oxygenating plants]].&lt;ref name="Creating a Garden Pond for Wildlife"&gt;{{cite book |title=Creating a Garden Pond for Wildlife |date=2011 |publisher=Freshwater Habitats Trust |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-9537971-2-7 |author=Pond Conservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nitrous oxide ===

[[Nitrous oxide]], N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, is a natural part of the [[nitrogen cycle]], but human [[land use]]s often add more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith (editor) |first=Keith |title=Nitrous Oxide and Climate Change |date=2010 |publisher=Earthscan |location=London |isbn=978-1844077571}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The nitrogen cycle and its influence on the European greenhouse gas balance |date=2011 |publisher=Centre for Ecology and Hydrology |isbn=978-1-906698-21-8 |first1=Mark |last1=Sutton |first2=Stefan |last2=Reis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardeners may cause extra nitrous oxide to be added to the atmosphere by:

* Using synthetic nitrogen [[fertilizer]], for example "weed and feed" on [[lawn]]s, especially if it is applied when plants are not actively growing, the soil is compacted, or when other factors are limiting so that the plants cannot make use of the nitrogen;&lt;ref name="Livesley 2010 273–293"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 20"&gt;{{cite web |last=Farming Futures |title=Climate change: be part of the solution Focus on: soil management (Fact Sheet 20) |url=http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk/sites/default/files/casestudy/pdf/FF_FS20_REV_Nov09%20%28final%29.pdf |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 21"&gt;{{cite web |last=Farming Futures |title=Climate change: be part of the solution Focus on: nutrient management (Fact Sheet 21) |url=http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk/sites/default/files/casestudy/pdf/FF_FS21_REVOCT09WEB.pdf |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Compacting the soil (for example by working in the garden when the soil is wet) which will increase the conversion of [[Nitrate#Uses|nitrates]] to nitrous oxide by soil bacteria;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 20"/&gt;
* Burning garden waste on [[bonfire]]s.

=== Black carbon ===

Black carbon is not a gas, but it acts like a greenhouse gas because it can be [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] in the atmosphere and absorb [[Thermal energy|heat]].&lt;ref name="Ullstein editor 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bond 2013"/&gt;

Gardeners may cause extra black carbon to be added to the atmosphere by burning garden [[pruning]]s and [[weed]]s on bonfires, especially if the waste is wet and becomes black carbon in the form of soot.&lt;ref name="Ecology for Gardeners"/&gt; Gardeners will also be responsible for extra black carbon produced when they buy garden products which have been transported by vehicles powered by [[fossil fuel]] especially the [[Diesel exhaust|diesel]] used in most lorries.

== Gardening to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and absorb carbon dioxide ==

There are many ways in which climate-friendly gardeners may reduce their contribution to climate change and help their gardens absorb [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gardening in the Global Greenhouse: The impacts of climate change on gardens in the UK |date=2002 |publisher=UK Climate Impacts Programme |location=Oxford |citeseerx = 10.1.1.131.6205 |first1=Richard |last1=Bisgrove |first2=Paul |last2=Hadley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate-friendly gardeners can find good ideas in many other [[Sustainability|sustainable]] approaches:
* [[Agroforestry]];
* [[Forest gardening]];
* [[Orchard]]s;
* [[Organic gardening]];
* [[Permaculture]];
* [[Rain garden]];
* [[Vegan organic gardening]];
* [[Water-wise gardening]];
* [[Wildlife garden]].

== Protecting and enhancing carbon stores ==

=== Protecting carbon stores in land beyond gardens ===
[[File:Woodland and wetland in the New Forest.JPG|thumb|Woodland and wetland in the New Forest, Hampshire]]
[[File:Woodland and trees in Herefordshire landscape.JPG|thumb|Woodland and trees in Herefordshire]]
[[File:Waterbutt in kitchen garden at Charles Darwin's home, Down House, Kent.JPG|thumb|Kitchen garden at Charles Darwin's home, Down House, Kent, showing greenhouse, waterbutt, box hedging and vegetable beds.]]
[[File:Alliums in dry garden at Cambridge Botanic Garden.JPG|thumb|Alliums, lavender, box and other water-thrifty plants in the dry garden at Cambridge Botanic Garden]]

Climate-friendly gardening includes actions which protect [[Carbon cycle#Main components|carbon stores]] beyond gardens. The biggest carbon stores in land are in soil; the two habitat types with the biggest carbon stores per hectare are [[Woodland|woods]] and [[wetland]]s; and woods absorb more carbon dioxide per hectare per year than most other habitats. Climate-friendly gardeners therefore aim to ensure that nothing they do will harm these habitats.

According to Morison and Morecroft&amp;nbsp;(eds.)'s ''Plant Growth and Climate Change'',&lt;ref name="Plant Growth and Climate Change"&gt;{{cite book |title=Plant Growth and Climate Change |date=2006 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Oxford |isbn=978-14051-3192-6 |first1=James I. L. |last1=Morison |first2=Michael D. |last2=Morecroft}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[net primary productivity]] (the net amount of carbon absorbed each year) of various habitats &lt;!--not encyclopedic: (they don't give a figure for wetlands)--&gt; is:

* [[Tropical forest]]s: 12.5 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year;
* [[Temperate forest]]s: 7.7 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year;
* [[Grassland|Temperate grassland]]s: 3.7 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year;
* [[Cropland]]s: 3.1 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year.

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]'s Special Report ''[[Land use, land-use change, and forestry]]''&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"/&gt; lists the carbon contained in different global habitats as:

* Wetlands: 643 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil&amp;nbsp;+ 43 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation&amp;nbsp;= total 686 tonnes carbon per hectare;
* Tropical forests: 123 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil&amp;nbsp;+ 120 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation&amp;nbsp;= total 243 tonnes carbon per hectare;
* Temperate forests: 96 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil&amp;nbsp;+ 57 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation&amp;nbsp;= total 153 tonnes carbon per hectare;
* Temperate grasslands: 164 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil&amp;nbsp;+ 7 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation&amp;nbsp;= total 171 tonnes carbon per hectare;
* Croplands: 80 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil&amp;nbsp;+ 2 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation&amp;nbsp;= total 82 tonnes carbon per hectare.

The figures quoted above are global averages. More recent research in 2009 has found that the habitat with the world's highest known total carbon density&amp;nbsp;- 1,867 tonnes of carbon per hectare&amp;nbsp;- is temperate moist forest of [[Eucalyptus regnans]] in the Central Highlands of south-east [[Australia]]; and, in general, that temperate forests contain more carbon than either [[boreal forest]]s or tropical forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keith |first1=Heather |first2=Brendan G. |last2=Mackey |first3=David B. |last3=Lindenmaye |title=Re-evaluation of forest biomass carbon stocks and lessons from the world's most carbon-dense forests |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=2009 |volume=106 |issue=28|doi=

===Carbon stores in Britain===
According to Milne and Brown's 1997 paper "Carbon in the vegetation and soils of Great Britain",&lt;ref name="Carbon in the vegetation and soils of Great Britain"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Milne |first1=R. |first2=T. A. |last2=Brown |title=Carbon in the vegetation and soils of Great Britain |journal=Journal of Environmental Management |date=1997 |volume=49 |pages=413–433 |doi=10.1006/jema.1995.0118}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Great Britain|Britain]]'s [[vegetation]] and soil are estimated to contain 9952 million tonnes of carbon, of which almost all is in the soil, and most in [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[bog|peatland]] soil:

* Soils in Scotland: 6948 million tonnes carbon;
* Soils in [[England]] and [[Wales]]: 2890 million tonnes carbon;
* Vegetation in British [[woodland|woods]] and [[plantation]]s (which cover only 11% of Britain's land area): 91 million tonnes carbon;
* Other vegetation: 23 million tonnes carbon.

A 2005 report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Climate Change and British Woodland |date=2005 |publisher=Forestry Commission |location=Edinburgh |isbn=0-85538-658-4 |first1=Mark |last1=Broadmeadow |first2=Duncan |last2=Ray |url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/fcin069.pdf/$FILE/fcin069.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that British woodland soil may contain as much as 250 tonnes of carbon per hectare.

Many studies of [[soil carbon]] only study the carbon in the top 30 centimetres, but soil is often much deeper than that, especially below woodland. One 2009 study of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Carbon cycle#Main components|carbon stores]] by Keith Dyson and others gives figures for soil carbon down to 100&amp;nbsp;cm below the [[habitat]]s, including "Forestland", "Cropland" and "Grassland", covered by the [[Kyoto Protocol]] reporting requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dyson |first1=Keith |first2=A.

* Forestland soils: average figures in tonnes carbon per hectare are 160 (England), 428 (Scotland), 203 (Wales), and 366 ([[Northern Ireland]]).
* Grassland soils: average figures in tonnes carbon per hectare are 148 (England), 386 (Scotland), 171 (Wales), and 304 (Northern Ireland).
* Cropland soils: average figures in tonnes carbon per hectare are 110 (England), 159 (Scotland), 108 (Wales), and 222 (Northern Ireland).

===Protecting carbon stores in wetland===

[[File:Symphytum grandiflorum, creeping comfrey, with Cotinus coggygria.JPG|thumb|A ground-cover and rain-garden plant - Symphytum grandiflorum, creeping comfrey (with Cotinus coggygria)]]
Climate-friendly gardeners choose [[peat]]-free [[Potting compost|compost]]s&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; because some of the planet's biggest [[Carbon cycle#Main components|carbon stores]] are in [[soil]], and especially in the [[Bog|peatland]] soil of [[wetland]]s.

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]'s Special Report ''Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry'' gives a figure of 2011 gigatonnes of carbon for global carbon stocks in the top 1 metre of soils, much more than the carbon stores in the vegetation or the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"/&gt;

Climate-friendly gardeners also avoid using [[tapwater]] not only because of the [[greenhouse gas]]es emitted when fossil fuels are burnt to treat and pump water,&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt; but because if water is taken from wetlands then carbon stores are more likely to be oxidised to [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"/&gt;

A climate-friendly garden therefore does not contain large [[Irrigation|irrigated]] [[lawn]]s, but instead includes [[water-butt]]s to collect [[rain]]water; water-thrifty plants which survive on rainwater and do not need watering after they are established; [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s and [[hedge]]s to [[Windbreak|shelter]] gardens from the drying effects of [[Sunlight|sun]] and [[wind]]; and [[groundcover]] plants and [[Mulch#Organic mulches|organic mulch]] to protect the soil and keep it moist.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecology for Gardeners"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;242&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;80–82&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardening Without Water"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gardening Without Water: Creating beautiful gardens using only rainwater |date=1999 |publisher=Search Press |location=Tunbridge Wells |isbn=0855328851 |first=Charlotte |last=Green}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate-friendly gardeners will ensure that any paved surfaces in their gardens (which are kept to a minimum to increase carbon stores) are [[Permeable paving|permeable]],&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; and may also make [[rain garden]]s, sunken areas into which rainwater from buildings and paving is directed, so that the rain can then be fed back into [[groundwater]] rather than going into [[storm drain]]s. The plants in rain gardens must be able to grow in both dry and wet soils.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rain Gardens: Managing Water Sustainably in the Garden and Designed Landscape |date=2007 |publisher=Timber Press |location=Portland, Oregon, USA |isbn=978-0881928266 |first1=Nigel |last1=Dunnett |first2=Andy |last2=Clayden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protecting carbon stores in woodland===
Wetlands may store the most carbon in their soils, but woods store more carbon in their living [[biomass]] than any other type of vegetation, and their soils store the most carbon after wetlands.&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"/&gt; Climate-friendly gardeners therefore ensure that any wooden products they buy, such as [[garden furniture]], have been made of wood from [[Sustainable forest management|sustainably managed]] woodland.

=== Protecting and increasing carbon stores in gardens ===
[[File:Juglans major at Cambridge Botanic Garden.jpg|thumb|Juglans elaeopyren, an American walnut, at Cambridge Botanic Garden]]

After [[Carbonate rocks|rocks containing carbonate compounds]], soil is the biggest [[Carbon cycle#Main components|store of carbon]] on land.&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"/&gt;
Carbon is found in [[soil organic matter]], including living organisms ([[Root|plant roots]], [[fungi]], [[animal]]s, [[protist]]s, [[bacteria]]), dead organisms, and [[humus]].&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;
One study of the environmental benefits of gardens estimates that 86% of carbon stores in gardens is in the soil.&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cameron |first1=Ross W. F. |first2=Tijana |last2=Blanuša |first3=Jane E. |last3=Taylor |first4=Andrew |last4=Salisbury |first5=Andrew J. |last5=Halstead |first6=Béatrice |last6=Henricot |first7=Ken |last7=Thompson |title=The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure |journal=Urban Forestry &amp; Urban Greening |date=2012 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=129–137 |doi=10.1016/j.ufug.2012.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fragaria vesca, wild strawberry.JPG|thumb|Wild strawberries in flower below a British hedge.]]

The first priorities for climate-friendly gardeners are, therefore, to:
* Protect the soil's existing carbon stores;
* Increase the soil's carbon stores.

To protect the soil, climate-friendly gardens:
* Are based on [[plant]]s rather than buildings and paving;&lt;ref name="Ecological Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"/&gt;
* Have soil that is kept at a relatively stable temperature by [[Windbreak|shelter]] from trees, shrubs and/or hedges;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Matthew |title=New Gardening: How to garden in a changing climate |date=2007 |publisher=Mitchell Beazley and the Royal Horticultural Society |location=London |isbn=9781845333058}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Have soil that is always kept covered and therefore moist and at a relatively stable temperature by [[groundcover]] plants, fast-growing [[green manure]]s (which can be used as an [[Intercropping|intercrop]] in [[kitchen garden]]s of [[Annual plant|annual]] vegetables) and/or [[Mulch#Organic mulches|organic mulches]].&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"&gt;{{cite book |last=Crawford |first=Martin |title=Creating a Forest Garden: Working with nature to grow edible crops |date=2010 |publisher=Green Books |location=Hartland, Devon |isbn=9781900322621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soil improvement and protection - wood chip mulch at Wisley.JPG|thumb|Mulch of woodchips protecting soil at the Royal Horticultural Society garden at Wisley in Surrey.]]

Climate-friendly gardeners avoid things which may harm soil. They do not tread on the soil when it is wet, because it is then most vulnerable to compaction. They [[Tillage|dig]] as little is possible, and only when the soil is moist rather than wet, because cultivation increases the [[oxidation]] of soil organic matter and produces [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;54–55&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 2013 12"&gt;{{cite book |last=Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs |title=Protecting our Water, Soil and Air: A Code of Good Agricultural Practice for farmers, growers and land managers |date=2013 |publisher=The Stationery Office |location=London |isbn=978 0 11 243284 5 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To increase soil carbon stores, climate-friendly gardeners ensure that their gardens create optimal conditions for vigorous healthy growth of plants, and other garden organisms above and below ground, and reduce the impact of any [[limiting factor]]s.

In general, the more [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] that the plants can create each year, the more carbon will be added to the soil.&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;54–55&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;
However, only some biomass each year becomes long-term [[soil carbon]] or humus. In ''Soil Carbon and Organic Farming'', a 2009 report for the [[Soil Association]], Gundula Azeez discusses several [[Environmental factor|factor]]s which increase how much biomass is turned into humus. These include good [[soil structure]], [[Soil biology|soil organisms]] such as fine [[root hair]]s, [[microorganism]]s, [[mycorrhiza]]s and [[earthworm]]s which increase [[Soil#Structure|soil aggregation]], residues from plants (such as trees and shrubs) which have a high content of resistant chemicals such as [[lignin]], and plant residues with a [[carbon to nitrogen ratio]] lower than about 32:1.&lt;ref name="Soil Carbon and Organic Farming"&gt;{{cite book |last=Azeez |first=Gundula |title=Soil Carbon and Organic Farming: A review of the evidence on the relationship between agriculture and soil carbon sequestration, and how organic farming can contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation |date=2009 |publisher=The Soil Association |location=Bristol |url=http://www.soilassociation.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=SSnOCMoqrXs%3D&amp;tabid=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soil fertility - nitrogen fixation by root nodules on Wistaria roots, with hazelnut to show size.JPG|thumb|Nitrogen-fixing nodules on Wisteria roots (hazelnut for scale)]]

Climate-friendly gardens therefore include:

* Hedges for shelter from wind;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;
* A light canopy of late-leafing [[deciduous]] trees to let in enough [[sunlight]] for growth but not so much that the garden becomes too hot and dry&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt; (this is one of the principles behind many [[agroforestry]] systems, such as [[Paulownia]]'s use in China partly because it is late-leafing and its [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] is sparse so that [[crop]]s below it get shelter but also enough light&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Temperate Agroforestry Systems |date=1997 |publisher=CAB International |location=Wallingford, Oxfordshire |isbn=9780851991474 |author=Yungying Wu |author2=Zhaohua Zhu |pages=170–172 |editor1-first=Andrew M. |editor1-last=Gordon |editor2-first=Steven M. |editor2-last=Newman |chapter=Temperate Agroforestry in China}}&lt;/ref&gt;);
* Groundcover plants and organic mulches (such as [[woodchips]] over [[compost]] made from kitchen and garden "waste") to keep soil moist and at relatively stable temperatures;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;
* [[Nitrogen fixation#Root nodule symbioses|Nitrogen-fixing plants]], because soil nitrogen may be a limiting factor (but climate-friendly gardeners avoid [[Fertilizer#Inorganic commercial fertilizer|synthetic nitrogen fertilizers]], because these may cause mycorrhizal associations to break down);&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;
* Many layers&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt; of plants, including [[Lignin|woody]] plants such as trees&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; and shrubs, other [[Perennial plant|perennials]], groundcover plants, deep-rooted plants, all chosen according to 'right plant, right place',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Nicola |title=Right Plant, Right Place |date=1986 |publisher=Pan |location=London |isbn=0 330 29656 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lancaster |first=Roy |title=Perfect Plant, Perfect Place |date=2010 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |location=London |isbn=978-1405348133}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that they are suited to their growing conditions and will grow well;
* A wide [[biodiversity|diversity]] of [[Plant disease resistance|disease-resistant]], vigorous plants for [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] and to make the most of all available [[ecological niche]]s;&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;
* Plants to [[Wildlife garden|feed and shelter]] wildlife, to increase total biomass, and to ensure [[Biological pest control|biological control]] of pests and diseases.&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden 54-55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=John|title=How to Create an Eco Garden: The Practical Guide to Greener, Planet-Friendly Gardening|date=2011|publisher=Anness Publishing|location=Wigston, Leicestershire|isbn=9781903141892|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecological Gardening" /&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Make a Wildlife Garden"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baines|first=Chris|title=How to Make a Wildlife Garden|date=2000|publisher=Frances Lincoln|location=London|isbn=9780711217119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Compost made from garden and kitchen "waste".&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;

Lawns, like other grasslands, can build up good levels of [[soil carbon]],&lt;ref name="Soil Carbon and Organic Farming"/&gt; but they will grow more vigorously and store more carbon if besides [[Lawn#Grasses|grasses]] they also contain nitrogen-fixing plants such as [[clover]],&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt; and if they are cut using a [[Lawn mower#Other notable types|mulching mower]] which returns finely-chopped mowings to the lawn. More carbon, however, may be stored by other perennial plants such as trees&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; and shrubs. They also do not need to be maintained using [[power tool]]s.

Climate-friendly gardeners will also aim to increase biodiversity not only for the sake of the wildlife itself, but so that the garden ecosystem is resilient and more likely to store as much carbon as possible as long as possible. They will therefore avoid pesticides,&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; and increase the diversity of the habitats within their gardens.

== Reducing greenhouse gas emissions ==
Climate-friendly gardeners can directly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from their own gardens, but can also use their gardens to indirectly reduce greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere.

=== Using gardens to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ===

Climate-friendly gardeners can use their gardens in ways which reduce [[greenhouse gas]]es elsewhere, for example by using the [[sunlight|sun]] and [[wind]] to dry [[Laundry|washing]] on [[Clothes line|washing lines]] in the garden instead of using [[electricity]] [[Electricity generation|generated]] by [[fossil fuel]] to dry washing in [[Clothes dryer|tumble dryers]].

====From farmland====
[[File:Juglans regia, walnut, with ripening nuts.JPG|thumb|Walnut, Juglans regia, with ripening walnuts]]
Food is a major contributor to climate change. In the United Kingdom, according to Tara Garnett of the [http://www.fcrn.org.uk/ Food Food Climate Research Network], food contributes 19% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="Cooking up a Storm"&gt;{{cite book |last=Garnett |first=Tara |title=Cooking up a Storm: Food, greenhouse gas emissions and our changing climate |date=September 2008 |publisher=Food Climate Research Network, Centre for Environmental Strategy, University of Surrey |location=Guildford, Surrey |url=http://www.fcrn.org.uk/sites/default/files/CuaS_web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil is the biggest [[Carbon cycle#Main components|store of carbon]] on [[land]]. It is therefore important to protect the [[soil organic matter]] in [[Agricultural land|farmland]]. Farm animals, however, especially free-range pigs, may cause erosion, and cultivation of the soil increases the [[oxidation]] of soil organic matter into [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 2013 12"/&gt; Other sources of greenhouse gases from farmland include: compaction caused by farm machinery or overgrazing by [[Livestock|farm animals]] can make soil [[:wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] and produce [[methane]]; farm animals produce methane; and [[Fertilizer#Inorganic commercial fertilizer|nitrogen fertilizer]]s can be converted to [[nitrous oxide]].

Most farmland consists of [[Arable land|fields growing annual arable crops]] which are eaten directly by people or fed to farm animals, and [[grassland]] used as [[pasture]], [[hay]] or [[silage]] to feed farm animals. Some [[Perennial crop|perennial food plants]] are also grown, such as [[fruit]]s and [[Nut (fruit)|nut]]s in [[orchard]]s, and [[watercress]] grown in water.

Although all cultivation of the soil in arable fields produces carbon dioxide, some arable crops cause more damage to soil than others. [[List of root vegetables|Root crops]] such as [[potato]]es and [[sugar-beet]], and crops which are harvested not just once a year but over a long period such as [[Leaf vegetable|green vegetables and salads]], are considered "high risk" in [[catchment-sensitive farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs |title=Soil Protection Review 2010 |date=2009 |publisher=Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs |location=London |pages=21–22 |url=http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/resources/000/145/513/PB13311.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 10"&gt;{{cite web |last=Farming Futures |title=Focus on arable crops (Fact Sheet 10) |url=http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk/sites/default/files/casestudy/pdf/FF_FS_REV_FS10_Arable%20crops.pdf |accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate-friendly gardeners therefore grow at least some of their food,&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; and may choose [[Agriculture|food crops]] which therefore help to keep carbon in farmland [[soil]]s if they grow such high-risk crops in small [[Kitchen garden|vegetable plots]] in their gardens, where it is easier to protect the soil than in large fields under [[Commercial agriculture|commercial]] pressures. Climate-friendly gardeners may grow and eat plants such as sweet [[cicely]] which sweeten food, and so reduce the land area needed for sugar-beet.&lt;ref name="Plants for a Future"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fern |first=Ken |title=Plants for a Future: Edible and useful plants for a healthier world |date=1997 |publisher=Permanent Publications |location=Clanfield, Hampshire |isbn=9781856230117}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
They may also choose to grow [[Perennial plant|perennial]] food plants to not only reduce their indirect greenhouse gas emissions from farmland, but also to increase carbon stores in their own gardens.&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Plants for a Future"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hart |first=Robert |title=Forest Gardening |date=1991 |publisher=Green Books |location=Hartland, Devon |isbn=1870098447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toensmeier |first=E. |title=Perennial Vegetables |date=2007 |publisher=Chelsea Green |location=Vermont, United States of America |isbn=9781931498401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grassland contains more carbon per hectare than arable fields, but farm animals, especially [[ruminant]]s such as [[cattle]] or [[sheep]], produce large amounts of [[methane]], directly and from manure heaps and slurry.&lt;ref name="Dave Reay 2010"/&gt; Slurry and manure may also produce nitrous oxide.&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 4"&gt;{{cite web |last=Farming Futures |title=Climate change series: General ways to mitigate climate change (Fact Sheet 4) |url=http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk/sites/default/files/casestudy/pdf/FF_FS4_Mitigation_WEB_Oct%202008.pdf |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Gardeners who want to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions can help themselves to eat less [[meat]] and [[dairy produce]] by growing [[Nut (fruit)|nut]] trees which are a good source of [[Umami|tasty]], [[protein]]-rich [[food]], including [[walnut]]s which are an excellent source of the [[Omega-3|omega-3 fatty acid]] [[alpha-linolenic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lyle |first=Susanna |title=Ultimate Fruit &amp; Nuts: A comprehensive guide to the cultivation, uses and health benefits of over 300 food-producing plants |date=2006 |publisher=Frances Lincoln |location=London |isbn=978-0-7112-2593-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers and farmers are investigating and improving ways of farming which are more sustainable, such as [[agroforestry]], [[forest farming]], [[Conservation agriculture|wildlife-friendly farming]], [[soil management]], [[catchment-sensitive farming]] (or water-friendly farming&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Freshwater Habitats Trust |title=Water-Friendly Farming |url=http://www.freshwaterhabitats.org.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Water-Friendly-Farming-Introduction.pdf |website=Freshwater Habitats Trust |accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;). For example, the organisation [http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk Farming Futures] assists farmers in the United Kingdom to reduce their farms' greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 23"&gt;{{cite web |last=Farming Futures |title=Climate change: be part of the solution Focus on energy efficiency (Fact Sheet 23) |url=http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk/sites/default/files/casestudy/pdf/FF_FS23_Energy%20efficiency.pdf |accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmers are aware that consumers are increasingly asking for "green credentials". Gardeners who understand climate-friendly practices can advocate their use by farmers.&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;

====From industry====
[[File:Elaeagnus umbellatus at the Agroforestry Research Trust forest garden.JPG|thumb|Nitrogen-fixing and edible - Elaeagnus umbellatus at the Agroforestry Research Trust forest garden in Devon]]
Climate-friendly gardeners aim to reduce their consumption in general.&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; In particular, they try to avoid or reduce their consumption of tapwater because of the greenhouse gases emitted when fossil fuels are burnt to supply the energy needed to treat and pump it to them.&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt; Instead, gardeners can garden using only rainwater.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardening Without Water"/&gt;

Greenhouse gases are produced in the [[Manufacturing|manufacture]] of many materials and products used by [[gardener]]s. For example, it takes a lot of [[Energy industry|energy]] to produce [[Fertilizer#Inorganic commercial fertilizer|synthetic fertilizer]]s, especially nitrogen fertilizers. [[Ammonium nitrate]], for example, has an [[embodied energy]] of 67000 kilojoules/kilogramme,&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt; so [[Sustainable living|climate-friendly]] gardeners will choose alternative ways of ensuring the soil in their gardens has optimal levels of nitrogen by alternative means such as [[Nitrogen fixation#Root nodule symbioses|nitrogen-fixing plants]].

Climate-friendly gardeners will also aim to follow "[[cradle-to-cradle design]]" and "[[circular economy]]" principles: when they choose to buy or make something, it should be possible to take it apart again and [[Recycling|recycle]] or [[compost]] every part, so that there is no waste, only [[Natural resource|raw materials]] to be made into something else.&lt;ref name="Cradle to Cradle: Re-making the Way We Make Things"&gt;{{cite book |last=Braungart and McDonough |first=Michael and William |title=Cradle to Cradle: Re-making the Way We Make Things |date=2009 |publisher=Vintage, Random House |location=London |isbn=9780099535478}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This will reduce the greenhouse gases otherwise produced when [[Natural resource#Extraction|extracting]] raw materials.

====From transport====
Gardeners can reduce not only their [[food miles]] by growing some of their own food, but also their "gardening miles" by reducing the amount of plants and other materials they import, obtaining them as locally as possible and with as little packaging as possible. This might include ordering plants by [[mail order]] from a specialist nursery if the plants are sent out [[Bare root|bare-root]], reducing transport demand and the use of [[peat]]-based composts; or growing plants from [[seed]], which will also increase [[genetic diversity]] and therefore [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]]; or growing plants [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]] from [[Cutting (plant)|cutting]]s or [[Offset (botany)|offset]]s from other local gardeners; or buying reclaimed materials from salvage firms.&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;

====From houses====
[[File:Parthenocissus tricuspidata, Boston ivy, in autumn colours.JPG|thumb|Climbers as insulation - Boston ivy, Parthenocissus tricuspidata, Boston ivy, in autumn]]
Climate-friendly gardeners can use their gardens in ways which reduce greenhouse gas emissions from homes by:

* Using sunlight and wind to dry washing on washing lines instead of fossil fuel-generated electricity to run [[Clothes dryer|tumble dryer]]s;
* Planting [[deciduous]] [[Vine|climber]]s on houses and planting deciduous trees at suitable distances from the house to provide shade during the summer, reducing the consumption of electricity for [[HVAC#Air conditioning|air conditioning]], but also such that at cooler times of year, sunlight can reach and warm a house, reducing [[HVAC#Heating|heating]] costs and consumption;&lt;ref name="Ecology for Gardeners"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"/&gt;
* Planting hedges, trees, shrubs and climbers to shelter houses from wind, reducing heating costs and consumption during the winter (as long as any planting does not create a [[Wind tunnel|wind-tunnel]] effect).&lt;ref name="Ecology for Gardeners"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;243&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"/&gt;

Climate-friendly gardeners may also choose to reduce their own personal greenhouse gas emissions by growing and eating [[carminative]] plants such as [[fennel]] and [[garlic]] which reduce intestinal gases such as methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Living Gut |date=2008 |publisher=Nottingham University Press |isbn=9781904761570 |first1=W.

There are some patent sources of greenhouse gas emissions in gardens and some more latent.

[[Power tool]]s which are powered by [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] or [[petrol]], or [[electricity]] [[Electricity generation|generated]] by burning other [[fossil fuel]]s, emit [[carbon dioxide]]. Climate-friendly gardeners may therefore choose to use [[Garden tool|hand tool]]s rather than power tools, or power tools powered by renewable electricity,&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; or [[Garden design|design their gardens]] to reduce or remove a need to use power tools. For example, they may choose dense, slow-growing species for [[hedge]]s so that the hedges only need to be cut once a year.&lt;ref name="Ecological Gardening"/&gt;

Lawns need[?] to be cut by lawn mowers and, in drier parts of the world, are often irrigated by tapwater. Climate-friendly gardeners will therefore do what they can to reduce this consumption by:

* Replacing part of or all lawns with other perennial planting such as trees and shrubs with less ecologically demanding maintenance requirements;
* Cut some or all lawns only once or twice a year, i.e. convert them into [[meadow]]s;
* Make lawn shapes simple so that they may be cut quickly;
* Increase the cutting height of mower blades;
* Use a mulching mower to return organic matter to the soil;
* Sow [[clover]] to increase vigour (without the need for synthetic fertilisers) and resilience in dry periods;
* Cut lawns with [[Lawn mower#Electricity|electric mower]]s using electricity from [[renewable energy]];
* Cut lawns with hand tools such as [[Lawn mower#By hand|push mower]]s or [[scythe]]s.&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"/&gt;

Greenhouses can be used to grow crops which might otherwise be imported from warmer climates, but if they are heated by fossil fuel then they may cause more greenhouse gas emissions than they save. Climate-friendly gardeners will therefore use their greenhouses carefully by:

* Choosing only annual plants which will only be in the greenhouse during warmer months, or perennial plants which do not need any extra heat during winter;
* Using water tanks as heat stores and compost heaps as heat sources inside greenhouses so that they stay frost-free in winter.

Climate-friendly gardeners will not put woody prunings on bonfires, which will emit carbon dioxide and black carbon,&lt;ref name="Ecology for Gardeners"/&gt; but instead burn them indoors in a [[wood-burning stove]] and therefore cut emissions from fossil fuel, or cut them up to use as [[mulch]] and increase soil carbon stores,&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; or add the smaller prunings to compost heaps to keep them [[Aeration|aerated]], reducing [[methane emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harriet Kopinska |author2=Jane Griffiths |author3=Heather Jackson |author4=Pauline Pears |title=The Garden Organic Book of Compost|date=2011|publisher=New Holland|location=London|isbn=9781847734372}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce the risk of fire, they will also choose fire-resistant plants from habitats which are not prone to [[wildfire]]s and which do not catch fire easily, rather than fire-adapted [[Wildfire#Plant adaptation|plants from fire-prone habitats]] which are flammable and adapted to encourage fires and then gain a competitive advantage over less resistant species.

Climate-friendly gardeners may use deep-rooted plants such as [[comfrey]] to bring nutrients closer to the surface topsoil, but will do so without making the leaves into a liquid feed, because the rotting leaves in the [[Hypoxia (environmental)#Aquatic hypoxia|anaerobic]] conditions under water may emit methane.

[[Fertilizer#Inorganic commercial fertilizer|Nitrogen fertilizer]]s may be [[Nitrous oxide#Soil|oxidised]] to [[nitrous oxide]],&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; especially if fertilizer is applied in excess, or when plants are not actively growing. Climate-friendly gardeners may choose instead to use [[Nitrogen fixation#Root nodule symbioses|nitrogen-fixing]] plants which will add nitrogen to the soil without increasing nitrous oxide emissions.

[[File:Composition5r.jpg|thumb|Composition 1920x1080]]
'''Composition studies''' (also referred to as '''composition and [[rhetoric]]''', '''rhetoric and composition''', '''writing studies''', or simply '''composition''') is the professional field of [[writing]], research, and instruction, focusing especially on writing at the college level in the [[United States]]. In many American colleges and universities, undergraduate [[students]] must take [[freshman]]—sometimes even higher—composition courses. 

Over seventy American universities offer doctoral study in rhetoric and composition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccccdoctoralconsortium.org/members/ Doctoral Consortium in Rhetoric and Composition]&lt;/ref&gt; programs which usually include study of [[Theories of rhetoric and composition pedagogy|composition pedagogical theory]], [[research methodologies in rhetoric and composition]], and [[Rhetoric|the history of rhetoric]]. Many composition [[scholars]] study not only the [[theory]] and practice of post-secondary [[writing]] instruction, but also the influence of different writing conventions and [[genres]] on writers' composing processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genreacrossborders.org/ Genre Across Borders]&lt;/ref&gt; Composition scholars also publish in the fields of teaching [[English as a second or foreign language]] (TESOL), [[writing center]]s, and [[new literacies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://compfaqs.org/CompFAQs/Home?from=Main.HomePage Comp FAQs from CompPile]&lt;/ref&gt;

==First-year composition==
{{Main|First-year composition}}
Most US universities have a required [[first-year composition]] course, also referred to as FYC. This is not the same as a [[literature]] course, which focuses on literary analysis and interpretation, although some colleges and universities do incorporate literature and other humanities into their composition courses; often, however, composition courses offer intensive instruction in writing [[non-fiction]], expository texts using academic discourse conventions. Writing curricula vary considerably from institution to institution, but it may emphasize many stages of different writing processes (invention or brainstorming, drafting, revision, editing, proofreading), different forms of writing (narration, exposition, description, argumentation, comparison and contrast), different portions of the written product (introductions, conclusions, thesis statements, presentation and documentation of forms of evidence, inclusion of quotations, etc.), along with different modalities of composing to expand the concept of 'writing'. Pedagogies or approaches to teaching writing are grounded in a range of different traditions and philosophies.

==Advanced composition==

Some universities require further instruction in writing and offer courses that expand upon the skills developed in First-year composition. Second level or advanced composition may emphasize forms of argumentation and persuasion, digital media, research and source documentation formats, and/or genres of writing across a range of disciplines and genres (see {{section link||Writing across the curriculum}} below). For example, the skills required to write business letters or annual reports will differ significantly from those required to write historical or scientific research or personal memoirs.

==Graduate studies==

Doctoral programs in Composition Studies are available at more than seventy universities and Masters's programs are available in over 170 universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdcwss.com Master's Degree Consortium of Writing Studies Specialists]&lt;/ref&gt; Such programs are commonly housed within English Studies or Education programs. However, recently there are an increasing number of departments specifically dedicated to this field of study (e.g. Composition Studies, Writing &amp; Rhetoric, Composition &amp; Linguistics, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/04/04/cccc|title=What Is a Composition and Rhetoric Doctorate?|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second-language writing==
{{Main|Second language writing}}
Second language writing is the practice of teaching English composition to non native speakers and writers of English. Teaching writing to ESL students does not receive much attention because even in ESL classes teachers focus on speaking, listening and reading, not just writing. [[Paul Kei Matsuda]] in his article "Situating ESL Writing in a Cross-Disciplinary Context" stresses the importance of teaching writing specifically with understanding the needs of ESL students to help them improve their writing.&lt;ref&gt;Matsuda, Paul K. "Situating ESL Writing in a Cross-Disciplinary Context." Written Communication, Sage Publications, 1998, 15 (1), pp 99-121.&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching writing has progressed through several approaches during the history of education in the United States. ESL teachers might need to explore common methods which are the cognitive, social and expressive theories to create an approach that meets the needs of ESL writers and help them to overcome their difficulties.

The first one of these approaches is the cognitive view which says that writing is progressing from one stage to another in a series of single steps. That means "good" writing is a planned process, which includes planning, translating and reviewing. "Understanding Composing" by Sondra Perl explains in detail this approach.&lt;ref&gt;Perl, Sondra. "Understanding Composing" Handout, Composition Theories, University of Akron, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She suggests that the composition of writing occurs as a recursive process. She took this idea from her observation of different writers. She thinks that writers return to "backwards" parts of the process in order to move "forward" with the overall composition. ESL teachers may find this approach helpful at first in teaching beginning ESL students because at this level students do not have large amounts of vocabulary and grammar or knowledge of the style of essays which is the basis of writing English. Al-Buainain Haifa in her article "Student Writing Errors in EFL," points out that, when a researcher asked ESL students by using a survey what they would like to have learned or learned better in their writing classes, they found that the largest percentages expressed specific needs in vocabulary and grammar &lt;ref&gt;Al-Buainain, Haifa. "Student Writing Errors in EFL." Qatar University, 2006, pp 1 -37.&lt;/ref&gt;(17). Many kinds of grammar make ESL students confused, especially because there are many exceptions. Because writing styles are different in different languages, ESL students need time to master them. Therefore, ESL teachers should find an effective way to teach ESL students vocabulary, grammar and style because the writing of English requires them. The cognitive approach can meet these needs because it emphasizes the steps, organization and process of writing.

Another approach is the social view which shows the importance of teaching writing by making students learn the different languages of discourse communities. This is what David Bartholomae emphasizes in his article "Inventing the University".&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomae, David "Inventing the University," Cross-Talk in Comp Theory, A Reader, 3rd ed. Edited by Victor Villanueva and Kristin L. Arola, National Council of Teachers of English, 2011, pp. 523- 555.&lt;/ref&gt; He uses "Inventing the University" as a phrase that describes the writing process that a student will experience when writing teachers ask them to write about a topic that relates with a discourse community which is new for them. Discourse community can be thought of as members of an academic discipline or a select audience. When the ESL students have become good at grammar and style, they face a large problem when they enter their chosen academic field. Bartholomae in this article illustrates that each academic community has a particular language or vocabulary. The problem is that any academic field has its own language, even jargon, that differs from one to another. This problem is faced not only by ESL students, but all American students will struggle with this when they begin the first year of their academic life. The social approach can be used by ESL teachers as a second step but they should make sure that their students master the basics of English writing such as grammar and style.

Moreover, the expressive view which is represented in Donald Murray's article "Teach Writing as a Process Not Product", allows for wittier creating and freer movement.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Donald M. "Teach Writing as a Process Not Product." Cross-Talk in Comp Theory, A Reader, 3rd ed. Edited by Victor Villanueva and Kristin L. Arola, National Council of Teachers of English, 2011, pp 3-6.&lt;/ref&gt; It suggests three elements for "good" writing which are integrity, originality, and spontaneity. However, it is difficult to evaluate them in a paper. Therefore, these standards cannot be relied upon to judge writing. In addition, these elements are not the important elements that help to assess "good" writing. ESL teachers might use this approach but it can only be used for highly advanced ESL students. It is difficult to ask ESL students to write freely if they possess limited vocabulary or grammar. They need examples to help them which they can find in the cognitive approach.

ESL teachers may use these common ways of teaching writing, but they need first to understand their student's difficulties. Learning writing is one of the essential difficulties that ESL students find in studying English, especially since writing is important in an academic community. Some ESL students may need to jump from being a student who does not speak English ever to a student who uses academic language in a short time which may put a large burden on their shoulders. Hence, teaching writing to ESL students is different than teaching native speakers. ESL teachers need to choose an effective way to meet the needs of ESL students. It would be helpful if ESL teachers look at these different ways of teaching writing to see which one addresses ESL students' difficulties in the best way or if a combination of these theories may be better.

=== Multicultural pedagogies ===

==== Basis in composition studies ====
While multicultural pedagogies are not specifically tied to second-language writing pedagogies, compositionists have often considered how students' cultural knowledge and use of idioms, dialects, and/or languages other than American Edited English (AEA) can enhance their instruction in English composition. For example, Maxine Hairston's "Diversity, Ideology, and Teaching Writing" advocates for students' expressivist writing to be central in a composition course, and believes students "need to write to find out how much they know and to gain confidence in the ability to express themselves effectively" (186).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hairston|first=Maxine|year=1992|title=Diversity, Ideology, and Teaching Writing|url=|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=43.3|pages=178–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hairston also believes that teachers can design writing assignments to encourage "cross-cultural awareness" (191).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, Beth Daniell's approach in "Narratives of Literacy: Connecting College Composition to Culture" describes how studies in "little narratives [that] almost all examine literacy in particular local settings" championed by scholars who "seldom make theoretical statements that claim to be valid for literate cultures in general or literate cultures in general," which would allow students to engage in cultural critique (403).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daniell|first=Beth|year=1999|title=Narratives of Literacy: Connecting College Composition to Culture|url=|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=50|pages=393–410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Schutz and Anne Ruggles Gere's article for ''College English'', "Service Learning and English Studies," described how Schutz's course, while it was mainly focused in service learning and local activism, engaged students in collaborative research and writing surrounding campus-wide issues, such as an instance of racial discrimination that occurred in the local student union; this allowed students to engage in cultural awareness as well as cultural critique (129-39).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schutz|first=Aaron|last2=Anne|first2=Gere|year=1998|title=Service Learning and English Studies: Rethinking 'Public Service|url=|journal=College English|volume=60|pages=129–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, In ''Empowering Education,'' Ira Shor delineates a pedagogy in which the teacher facilitates discussion of generative themes produced by the students, using the example of his basic writing course with working-class students at "a low-budget college in New York City" several decades ago (10).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empowering Education: Critical Teaching for Social Change|last=Shor|first=Ira|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0-226-14786-4|location=Chicago|pages=|quote=|via=Google Play Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Freirean approach for teaching literacy and writing that Shor reviews in ''Empowering Education'' demonstrates how the generative words manifested themselves "[through] researching local issues and language in the students' communities. From the many linguistic and sociological items…the educators selected some key concerns—generative themes expressed through generative words" (55).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this framework, teachers and students research these items collaboratively, and once students have presented their research on problems in their community, they may begin to decide how they might analyze and upend power structures or rhetorical situations that contribute to and exacerbate such issues. For Shor's classroom, "[t]he generative themes [that have] emerg[ed]…from student culture have most often related to sex, abortion, drugs, family, education, careers, work, and the economic crisis" (56).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Shor believes it is important to allow students to build a basis for problem-posing upon their prior knowledge and experiences to make it multicultural.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Shor also reviews Paolo Freire's literacy project in Brazil as described in Freire's ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'', which enforces the idea that all people are creators of culture through visuals, oral discussion, and creation of word lists that are the basis for which the people begin to use language to express how the dominant culture operates, how their home culture operates, and how these systemic actions impact themselves and the world (Freire 87-124).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pedagogy of the Oppressed: 30th Anniversary Edition|last=Freire|first=Paolo|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|translator-last=Ramos|translator-first=Myra|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, both Freire and Shor believe problem-posing education can be situated in multicultural practices as well as critical literacy practices. Shor insists "subject matter is best introduced as problems related to student experience, in language familiar to them" (63).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Critical reception ====
Overall, previous scholars' discussion of multiculturalism in the classroom seems to privilege "cross-cultural interactions" and valuing students' home languages as well as their cultural ideologies. However, in Donald Lazere's ''Political Literacy in Composition and Rhetoric'', Lazere criticizes Hairston, Daniell, Schutz, Gere, and other scholars for their approaches because of their singular focus on localism in lieu of more "global" and critical approaches to the study of culture in the composition classroom (152-153).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Literacy in Composition and Rhetoric: Defending Academic Discourse Against Postmodern Pluralism|last=Lazere|first=Donald|publisher=Southern Illinois UP|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8093-3428-5|location=Carbondale|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Lazere was critical of scholars' tendency to diminish the power of Edited American English (EAE) and misrepresent the power of the students' regional code (116).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While Lazere supports Shor's approach to multicultural critical pedagogy, he admits some level of discomfort with applying it in his own classroom especially with respect to how much responsibility and stock Shor places in students (39).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Current approaches ====
Lazere's critique of previous scholarship related to multiculturalism pedagogies, in ''Political Literacy in Composition and Rhetoric'' and elsewhere, has prompted current composition theorists, both in second-language writing and in the field of composition in general, to consider how multicultural pedagogies can embrace globalism as much as localism.

For example, Lisa Eck's "Thinking Globally, Teaching Locally" describes how Eck teaches world literature courses in which students read cultural narratives and problematize them—in the article, she references her use of Tsitsi Dangarembga's ''Nervous Conditions'' in her composition classroom.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eck|first=Lisa|year=2008|title=Thinking Globally, Teaching Locally|url=|journal=College English|volume=60|pages=578–598|via=CompPile}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through her teaching, she is attempting to answer the question of how multicultural pedagogical practices could still be based in research, critical literacy, and problem-posing education. In her approach, she engages students in the kind of literary criticism that is necessary for analyzing and evaluating critical discourse: "I work to make hybrid postcolonial identities familiar, even analogous at times, to what we understand as the process of identity formation for the average postmodern college student….I [also] use the Otherness of the cultures reproduced in foreign texts to estrange the American familiar" (579).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The kinds of inquiry students are using to analyze the text are to show how the text is ''both'' "not about you" and "about you," and how these processes of identity formation are the kinds of processes necessary to critically evaluate public discourse.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Furthermore, Jennifer S. Wilson's approach to critical pedagogy in second-language writing as she describes it in her article, "Engaging Second Language Writers in Freshman Composition: A Critical Approach," utilizes a perspective that provides opportunities for the types of writing necessary for students to critically analyze and evaluate ideologies entrenched in the dominant discourse, even as they are learning English as their second language.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Jennifer|year=2010|title=Engaging Second Language Writers in Freshman Composition: A Critical Approach|url=|journal=Composition Forum|volume=22|pages=1–14|via=CompPile}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the four major elements of the course that Wilson describes, especially with respect to the ideas she offers for critical writing assignments, create alternative pathways for students to produce writing that has the potential to disrupt cultural and political ideologies represented in various avenues and niches of the dominant public discourse. For example, in addition to incorporating "local topics," Wilson provides options for students to "investigate language use in certain communities, societies, or cultures" as well as "investigating" the relationships between language and power (8-9).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Even more important, she insists that "[c]ritical pedagogy is concerned with minimizing the power differential between student and teacher; in composition classrooms one way for students to maximize their voices is to publish their work in authentic ways" (9).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Writing across the curriculum==
{{Main|Writing across the curriculum}}
Because academic discourse is not monolithic (in other words, there are curricula that address that the concept of academic discourse can be applied to specific parts of a writing curriculum), many compositionists have created a writing across the curriculum (WAC) movement that situates writing-intensive instruction in specific academic [[discourse]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/composing-a-community-a-history-of-writing-across-the-curriculum/oclc/318390431&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Composing a community: a history of writing across the curriculum|last=McLeod|first=Susan H|last2=Soven|first2=Margot Iris|date=2006|publisher=Parlor Press|isbn=1932559175|location=West Lafayette, Ind.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing in the disciplines==

Many university writing programs include writing in the disciplines (WID) courses, which focus on the genres and writing procedures that occur within specific fields of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wac.colostate.edu/intro/pop2e.cfm|title=The WAC Clearinghouse|website=wac.colostate.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing center==
{{Main|Writing center}}
Many colleges and universities have a writing center, which offers supplementary tutorial support for writing specifically in English classes and/or across the curriculum. Many universities not in North America only offer writing instruction via writing centers. The European Association for the Teaching of Academic Writing (EATAW),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eataw.eu/ |title=European Association for the Teaching of Academic Writing |website=eataw.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, specifically concerns itself with the study and advancement of writing centers in Europe.

Since [[multimodality]] has resonated with Composition Studies, many writing centers have developed associated centers to support students' multimodal, multimedia composing. Some models for this work include the [[digital studio]] and the multiliteracy center.

Condensed DNA often has surprising properties, which one would not predict from classical concepts of dilute solutions. Therefore, DNA condensation ''in vitro'' serves as a [[Scientific model|model system]] for many processes of [[physics]], [[biochemistry]] and [[biology]].&lt;ref name="Bloomfield'96"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bloomfield |first= VA|year=1996 |pages=334–41 |title=DNA condensation |volume=6 |journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology| doi=10.1016/S0959-440X(96)80052-2 |issue=3 |pmid=8804837}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, DNA condensation has many potential applications in [[medicine]] and [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref name="Teif" /&gt;

DNA diameter is about 2&amp;nbsp;nm, while the length of a stretched single molecule may be up to several dozens of centimetres depending on the organism. Many features of the DNA double helix contribute to its large stiffness, including the mechanical properties of the sugar-phosphate backbone, electrostatic repulsion between [[phosphate]]s (DNA bears on average one elementary negative charge per each 0.17&amp;nbsp;nm of the [[double helix]]), stacking interactions between the bases of each individual strand, and strand-strand interactions. DNA is one of the stiffest natural polymers, yet it is also one of the longest molecules. This means that at large distances DNA can be considered as a flexible rope, and on a short scale as a stiff rod. Like a garden hose, unpacked DNA would randomly occupy a much larger volume than when it is orderly packed. Mathematically, for a non-interacting flexible chain randomly diffusing in 3D, the end-to-end distance would scale as a square root of the polymer length. For real polymers such as DNA, this gives only a very rough estimate; what is important, is that the space available for the DNA ''in vivo'' is much smaller than the space that it would occupy in the case of a free diffusion in the solution. To cope with volume constraints, DNA can pack itself in the appropriate solution conditions with the help of ions and other molecules. Usually, DNA condensation is defined as "the collapse of extended DNA chains into compact, orderly particles containing only one or a few molecules".&lt;ref name="Bloomfield'97"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bloomfield |first= VA|year=1997 |pages=269–82 |title=DNA condensation by multivalent cations |volume=44 |journal=Biopolymers | doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0282(1997)44:3&lt;269::AID-BIP6&gt;3.0.CO;2-T |issue=3 |pmid=9591479 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition applies to many situations in vitro and is also close to the definition of DNA condensation in bacteria as "adoption of relatively concentrated, compact state occupying a fraction of the volume available".&lt;ref name="Zimmerman&amp;Murphy'96"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zimmerman |first1= SB |last2= Murphy |first2= LD|year=1996 |pages=245–8 |title=Macromolecular crowding and the mandatory condensation of DNA in bacteria |volume=390 |journal=FEBS Letters| doi=10.1016/0014-5793(96)00725-9 |issue=3 |pmid=8706869}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[eukaryotes]], the DNA size and the number of other participating players are much larger, and a DNA molecule forms millions of ordered [[nucleoprotein]] particles, the [[nucleosome]]s, which is just the first of many levels of DNA packing.&lt;ref name="Teif" /&gt;

== DNA condensation in viruses ==
In [[virus]]es and [[bacteriophage]]s, the DNA or RNA is surrounded by a protein [[capsid]], sometimes further enveloped by a lipid [[membrane]]. Double-stranded DNA is stored inside the capsid in the form of a spool, which can have different types of coiling leading to different types of [[liquid crystal|liquid-crystalline]] packing. This packing can change from [[hexagonal]] to [[cholesteric]] to [[isotropic]] at different stages of the phage functioning. Although the double helices are always locally aligned, the DNA inside viruses does not represent real [[liquid crystals]], because it lacks fluidity. On the other hand,  DNA condensed ''in vitro'', e.g., with the help of polyamines also present in viruses, is both locally ordered and fluid.&lt;ref name="Teif" /&gt;

== DNA condensation in bacteria ==
Bacterial DNA is packed with the help of [[polyamines]] and proteins. Protein-associated DNA occupies about 1/4 of the intracellular volume forming a concentrated viscous phase with liquid crystalline properties, called the nucleoid. Similar DNA packaging exists also in [[chloroplast]]s and [[mitochondria]]. Bacterial DNA is sometimes referred to as the [[bacterial chromosome]]. Bacterial nucleoid evolutionary represents an intermediate engineering solution between the protein-free DNA packing in viruses and protein-determined packing in eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="Teif" /&gt;

[[Sister chromatids|Sister chromosomes]] in the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' are induced by stressful conditions to condense and undergo pairing.&lt;ref name="pmid23884460"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shechter N, Zaltzman L, Weiner A, Brumfeld V, Shimoni E, Fridmann-Sirkis Y, Minsky A |title=Stress-induced condensation of bacterial genomes results in re-pairing of sister chromosomes: implications for double strand DNA break repair |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=288 |issue=35 |pages=25659–67 |year=2013 |pmid=23884460 |pmc=3757227 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M113.473025 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stress-induced condensation occurs by a non-random, zipper-like convergence of sister chromosomes.  This convergence appears to depend on the ability of identical double-stranded [[DNA]] molecules to specifically identify each other, a process that culminates in the proximity of homologous sites along the paired chromosomes.  Diverse stress conditions appear to prime bacteria to effectively cope with severe [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damages]] such as double-strand breaks.  The apposition of homologous sites associated with stress-induced chromosome condensation helps explain how repair of double-strand breaks and other damages occurs.&lt;ref name="pmid23884460" /&gt;

== DNA condensation in eukaryotes ==
[[File:Chromatin chromosome.png|thumb|Different levels of DNA condensation in eukaryotes. (1) Single DNA strand. (2) [[Chromatin]] strand (DNA with histones). (3) Chromatin during [[interphase]] with [[centromere]]. (4) Two copies of condensed chromatin together during [[prophase]]. (5) Chromosome during [[metaphase]].]]
Eukaryotic DNA with a typical length of dozens of centimeters should be orderly packed to be readily accessible inside the micrometer-size nucleus. In unicellular eukaryotes known as [[dinoflagellates]], it is possible to distinguish liquid-crystalline chromosomal ordering,&lt;ref name="Chow"&gt;{{cite journal |first1= MH |last1= Chow |first2= KTH |last2= Yan |first3= MJ |last3= Bennett |first4= JTY |last4= Wong |year=2010 |pages=1577–87 |title=Birefringence and DNA condensation of liquid crystalline chromosomes  |volume=9 |journal=[[Eukaryotic Cell (journal)|Eukaryotic Cell]] | doi=10.1128/EC.00026-10 |issue=10 |pmc=2950428 |pmid=20400466}}&lt;/ref&gt; that they do not contain easily detectable histones, until recently it was thought that they were completely absent and that dinoflagellates were mesokaryotic though this is no longer the case and they are now classified as alveolates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4751559 | pmid=26646152 | doi=10.1534/g3.115.023275 | volume=6 | title=Diversity and Divergence of Dinoflagellate Histone Proteins | author=Marinov GK, Lynch M | journal=G3 (Bethesda) | pages=397–422}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other eukaryotes, DNA is arranged in the cell nucleus with the help of histones. In this case, the basic level of DNA compaction is the nucleosome, where the double helix is wrapped around the histone octamer containing two copies of each [[histone]] [[histone H2A|H2A]], [[histone H2B|H2B]], [[histone H3|H3]] and [[histone H4|H4]]. Linker [[histone H1]] binds the DNA between nucleosomes and facilitates packaging of the 10&amp;nbsp;nm "beads on the string" nucleosomal chain into a more condensed 30&amp;nbsp;nm fiber. Most of the time, between cell divisions, [[chromatin]] is optimized to allow easy access of transcription factors to active [[genes]], which are characterized by a less compact structure called [[euchromatin]], and to alleviate protein access in more tightly packed regions called [[heterochromatin]]. During the cell division, chromatin compaction increases even more to form [[chromosome]]s, which can cope with large mechanical forces dragging them into each of the two daughter cells.&lt;ref name="Teif" /&gt;

== DNA condensation ''in vitro'' ==
DNA condensation can be induced ''in vitro'' either by applying external force to bring the double helices together, or by inducing attractive interactions between the DNA segments. The former can be achieved e.g. with the help of the osmotic pressure exerted by crowding neutral polymers in the presence of monovalent salts. In this case, the forces pushing the double helices together are coming from entropic random collisions with the crowding polymers surrounding DNA condensates, and salt is required to neutralize DNA charges and decrease DNA-DNA repulsion. The second possibility can be realized by inducing attractive interactions between the DNA segments by multivalent cationic charged ligands (multivalent [[metal ions]], inorganic [[cations]], [[polyamines]], [[protamines]], [[peptides]], [[lipids]], [[liposomes]] and [[proteins]]).&lt;ref name="Teif" /&gt;

== Physics of DNA condensation ==
Condensation of long double-helical DNAs is a sharp [[phase transition]], which takes place within a narrow interval of condensing agent concentrations.[ref] Since the double helices come very closely to each other in the condensed phase, this leads to the restructuring of water molecules, which gives rise to the so-called [[hydration forces]].[ref] To understand attraction between negatively charged DNA molecules, one also must account for [[counterion correlation|correlations]] between counterions in the solution.[ref] DNA condensation by proteins can exhibit hysteresis, which can be explained using a modified [[Ising model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vtyurina|first=Natalia N.|last2=Dulin|first2=David|last3=Docter|first3=Margreet W.|last4=Meyer|first4=Anne S.|last5=Dekker|first5=Nynke H.|last6=Abbondanzieri|first6=Elio A.|date=2016-04-18|title=Hysteresis in DNA compaction by Dps is described by an Ising model|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/04/14/1521241113|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|pages=201521241|doi=10.1073/pnas.1521241113|issn=0027-8424|pmid=27091987|volume=113|bibcode=2016PNAS..113.4982V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== DNA condensation and gene regulation ==
Nowadays descriptions of gene regulation are based on the approximations of [[equilibrium binding]] in [[dilute solution]]s, although it is clear that these assumptions are in fact violated in [[chromatin]]. The dilute-solution approximation is violated for two reasons. First, the chromatin content is far from being dilute, and second, the numbers of the participating molecules are sometimes so small, that it does not make sense to talk about the bulk concentrations. Further differences from dilute solutions arise due to the different binding affinities of proteins to condensed and uncondensed DNA. Thus in condensed DNA both the reaction rates can be changed and their dependence on the concentrations of reactants may become nonlinear.&lt;ref name="Teif" /&gt;

The '''Dirac large numbers hypothesis''' ('''LNH''') is an observation made by [[Paul Dirac]] in 1937 relating ratios of size scales in the [[Universe]] to that of force scales. The ratios constitute very large, dimensionless numbers: some [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1039|40 orders of magnitude]] in the present cosmological epoch. According to Dirac's hypothesis, the apparent similarity of these ratios might not be a mere coincidence but instead could imply a [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] with these unusual features:
*The strength of gravity, as represented by the [[gravitational constant]], is inversely proportional to the [[age of the universe]]: &lt;math&gt;G \propto 1/t\,&lt;/math&gt;
*The mass of the universe is proportional to the square of the universe's age: &lt;math&gt;M \propto t^2&lt;/math&gt;.
Neither of these two features has gained wide acceptance in mainstream physics.

== Background ==

LNH was Dirac's personal response to a set of large number 'coincidences' that had intrigued other theorists of his time. The 'coincidences' began with [[Hermann Weyl]] (1919),&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; who speculated that the observed radius of the universe, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt;, might also be the hypothetical radius of a particle whose rest energy is equal to the gravitational self-energy of the electron:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {R_U}{r_e}\approx \frac{r_H}{r_e} \approx 10^{42} ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_e = \frac {e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 m_e c^2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_H = \frac {e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 m_H c^2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m_H c^2 = \frac {Gm_e^2}{r_e}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[classical electron radius]], ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of the electron, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the mass of the hypothetical particle, and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; is its electrostatic radius.

The coincidence was further developed by [[Arthur Eddington]] (1931)&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author=A. Eddington
 |year=1931
 |title=Preliminary Note on the Masses of the Electron, the Proton, and the Universe

 |bibcode=1931PCPS...27...15E
 |doi=10.1017/S0305004100009269
}}&lt;/ref&gt; who related the above ratios to '''N''', the estimated number of charged particles in the universe:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 Gm_e^2} \approx \sqrt {N} \approx 10^{42}.&lt;/math&gt;

In addition to the examples of Weyl and Eddington, Dirac was also influenced by the [[primeval-atom hypothesis]] of [[Georges Lemaître]], who lectured on the topic in Cambridge in 1933. The notion of a varying-G cosmology first appears in the work of [[Edward Arthur Milne]] a few years before Dirac formulated LNH. Milne was inspired not by large number coincidences but by a dislike of Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Milne, space was not a structured object but simply a system of reference in which relations such as this could accommodate Einstein's conclusions:
:&lt;math&gt;G = \left(\frac{c^3}{M_U}\right)t,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''M''&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of the universe and ''t'' is the age of the universe in seconds. According to this relation, ''G'' increases over time.

== Dirac's interpretation of the large number coincidences==

The Weyl and Eddington ratios above can be rephrased in a variety of ways, as for instance in the context of time:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {ct}{r_e} \approx 10^{40},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is the age of the universe, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the classical electron radius. Hence, in units where ''c''=1 and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, the age of the universe is about 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; units of time. This is the same [[order of magnitude]] as the ratio of the [[electromagnetic force|electrical]] to the [[gravitational]] [[force]]s between a [[proton]] and an [[electron]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 G m_p m_e} \approx 10^{40}.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, interpreting the [[electric charge|charge]] &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; of the [[electron]], the [[mass]] &lt;math&gt;m_p&lt;/math&gt;/&lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; of the proton/electron, and the permittivity factor &lt;math&gt; 4 \pi \epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; in atomic units (equal to 1), the value of the [[gravitational constant]] is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−40&lt;/sup&gt;. Dirac interpreted this to mean that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; varies with time as &lt;math&gt;G \approx 1/t\,&lt;/math&gt;. Although [[George Gamow]] noted that such a temporal variation does not necessarily follow from Dirac's assumptions,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

 |title=Dirac: A Scientific Biography

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a corresponding change of G has not been found.&lt;ref&gt;

 |bibcode=2003RvMP...75..403U
 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.75.403
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to general relativity, however, G is constant, otherwise the law of conserved energy is violated. Dirac met this difficulty by introducing into the [[Einstein field equations]] a gauge function {{lang|grc|β}} that describes the structure of spacetime in terms of a ratio of gravitational and electromagnetic units. He also provided alternative scenarios for the continuous creation of matter, one of the other significant issues in LNH:
*'additive' creation (new matter is created uniformly throughout space) and
*'multiplicative' creation (new matter is created where there are already concentrations of mass).

== Later developments and interpretations ==

Dirac's theory has inspired and continues to inspire a significant body of scientific literature in a variety of disciplines. In the context of [[geophysics]], for instance, [[Edward Teller]] seemed to raise a serious objection to LNH in 1948&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he argued that variations in the strength of gravity are not consistent with [[paleontology|paleontological]] data. However, [[George Gamow]] demonstrated in 1962&lt;ref&gt;

Known as the [[anthropic coincidence]] or [[fine-tuned universe]], it simply states that the large numbers in LNH are a necessary coincidence for intelligent beings since they parametrize [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] of [[hydrogen]] in [[star]]s and hence carbon-based [[life]] would not arise otherwise.

Various authors have introduced new sets of numbers into the original 'coincidence' considered by Dirac and his contemporaries, thus broadening or even departing from Dirac's own conclusions. Jordan (1947)&lt;ref&gt;

Several authors have recently identified and pondered the significance of yet another large number, approximately [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#Larger than 10100|120 orders of magnitude]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7073">The concept of a biological [[species]] as a group of organisms capable of interbreeding to produce viable offspring dates back to at least the 18th century, although it is often associated today with [[Ernst Mayr]].  Species of the fruit-fly ''[[Drosophila]]'' are one of the most commonly used organisms in evolutionary research, and have been used to test many theories related to the evolution of species.  The [[genus]] ''Drosophila'' comprises numerous species that have varying degrees of premating and postmating isolation (including hybrid sterility) between them.  These species are useful for testing hypotheses of the reproductive mechanisms underlying [[speciation]].

== Historical background ==

Working in the early 20th century [[T.H. Morgan]], was the first to use ''Drosophila'' to explore heredity.  Primarily on the basis of work with ''[[Drosophila melanogaster|D. melanogaster]]'', Morgan and his colleagues C.B. Bridges, A.H. Sturtevant, and H.J. Mueller developed a chromosome theory of heredity, for which Morgan was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1933.  Their experiments consisted of cross-breeding ''Drosophila'' mutants and documenting offspring.  Another highly regarded figure in ''Drosophila'' research was Theodosius [[Dobzhansky]], who invented the use of genetic markers and used them to study [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] [[sterility (physiology)|sterility]] between ''Drosophila pseudoobscura'' and ''Drosophila persimilis'' (Futuyma 1997).  This experimental method has been used for many years.

== Gender determination in ''Drosophila'' ==

The [[genome]] of ''D. melanogaster'', has been sequenced and studied in fine detail.  It is now known that ''Drosophila'' has 6 chromosomes—an X/Y pair and four [[autosomal]] chromosomes.  The genome comprises about 139.5 million base pairs.  There are about 15,000 genes.

Gender is determined in ''Drosophila'' not by the presence or absence of the Y chromosome as in mammals, but by the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes.

== Experimentation ==

In the off-spring of crosses between ''Drosophila simulans'' and its island derivative ''Drosophila mauritiana,'' female hybrids are fertile but male hybrids are sterile.  Recent studies have shown that a critical gene for gender determination in ''Drosophila'' known as the sex-lethal gene is highly misregulated in ''D. melanogaster'' and ''D. simulans'' hybrids, compared with the degree of misregulation of non-sex biased genes studied.  The sex-lethal gene is often abnormally expressed in male hybrids from ''D. melanogaster'' mothers as a result of re-localization of the male-specific complex to the X chromosome, which contributes to the male sterility.  Abnormalities in sperm array were found in very few individuals during their larval stage, meaning that disruptions in [[spermatogenesis]] most likely occur during later stages in life. {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Experiments involving crosses between ''D. pseudoananassae'' and ''D. bipectinata'', ''D. pseudoananassae'' and ''D. parabipectinata'', and ''D. pseudoananassae'' and ''D. malerkotliana'' have further shown that the Y chromosome has a role in hybrid male sterility.  The possible interactions of Y chromosome are X-Y, Y-autosome and Y-cytoplasm (Paras 2006).  The sterile males carry a set of conspecific autosomes to the Y chromosome, which results in fertility because of the Y-dominant autosome interactions.  Therefore, Y-autosome interactions are ruled out in this type of hybrid sterility.

Since cytoplasmic factors can be compatible between these species (Reference needed), such factors are also dismissed as the cause of sterility.

However, in ''Drosophila paulistorum'' there is information suggesting that if Y chromosome and cytoplasm are from different parents, the male is usually sterile. (Perez-Salas &amp; Ehrman 1971) X-Y interactions are the most likely cause of sterility in male hybrids.  It has been shown that interbreeding organisms that have more genetic compatibilities have less disruption of [[spermatogenesis]] and normal sized testes, while species who are less genetically compatible have a higher disruption in spermatogenesis and generally have atrophied testes. (Reference needed)

Another possible cause of sterility among species in which presence or absence of one or the other sex chromosome determines gender, is if one sex chromosome of one species has recessive alleles interacting with autosomal alleles of the mating species.  This could cause the heterogametic sex chromosome in the hybrid to be inviable or sterile, but homogametic sex chromosome will be fertile (Futuyma 1997).  Consequently, in species where presence or absence of a Y chromosome determines gender, for instance, individuals carrying XY chromosomes (males) will be sterile and those carrying XX (females) will be fertile.  This is closely related to [[Haldane's rule]].

It has also been shown that microbial infections of invertebrates can cause modification of the gender and fertility of host's off-spring. For instance, infections of nematodes or of arthropods, including Drosophila, species of the rickettsial bacteria [[Wolbachia]] can produce a male-specific sterility, which is congenital by means of transmission through the female line.

== Controversy ==

Experiments have led scientists to believe that many observations recorded in laboratories neglect existing [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] factors in hybrid sterility due to crossing parents from non-isofemale lines, as well as possibly underestimating actual degrees of sterility caused by inaccurate measures of [[motility]].  (Reference needed) Failure to account for potential polymorphism could lead to misinterpretation of the scale on which hybrid sterility occurs.

'''Ecoinformatics''', or ecological informatics, is the science of information ([[Informatics (academic field)|Informatics]]) in [[Ecology]] and [[Environmental science]]. It integrates environmental and information sciences to define entities and natural processes with language common to both humans and computers. However, this is a rapidly developing area in ecology and there are alternative perspectives on what constitutes ecoinformatics. 

A few definitions have been circulating, mostly centered on the creation of tools to access and analyze natural system data. However, the scope and aims of ecoinformatics are certainly broader than the development of metadata standards to be used in documenting datasets. Ecoinformatics aims to facilitate environmental research and management by developing ways to access, integrate [[database]]s of environmental information, and develop new algorithms enabling different environmental datasets to be combined to test ecological hypotheses.  

Ecoinformatics characterize the [[semantics]] of natural system knowledge. For this reason, much of today's ecoinformatics research relates to the branch of [[computer science]] known as [[Knowledge representation]], and active ecoinformatics projects are developing links to activities such as the [[Semantic Web]]. 

Current initiatives to effectively manage, share, and reuse ecological data are indicative of the increasing importance of fields like Ecoinformatics to develop the foundations for effectively managing ecological information. Examples of these initiatives are  [[National Science Foundation]] [[Datanet]] projects, [[DataONE]] and Data Conservancy.

'''Five Towns College''' is a [[for-profit colleges|for-profit]] college in [[Dix Hills, New York|Dix Hills]], [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

==History==
Five Towns College was founded as a [[business school]] in 1972 by Lorraine Kleinman Cohen and Stanley G. Cohen, Ed.D. Programs at the college have expanded to cover popular music, theatre, film, and communications.

The original proposed site for this college was to be in [[Lawrence, Nassau County, New York|Lawrence]] in southwestern [[Nassau County, New York]], an area known as "The [[Five Towns]]", but the college was actually sited in [[Merrick, New York]]. Five Towns College moved to [[Seaford, New York]] in 1982 and to its current location in Dix Hills in [[Suffolk County, New York]] in 1992.

Although the college is a [[for-profit colleges|for-profit college]], its board of trustees and its founding president Stanley Cohen have argued that the college would be "better positioned to build an endowment if it were a nonprofit." Cohen, however, was removed from office in 2014 and shareholders have filed suit against the plan to make the college non-profit.&lt;ref name=Newsday_2014_05_23&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/stanley-cohen-five-towns-college-founder-ousted-by-trustees-1.8167224 |title=Five Towns College founder removed by trustees |author= |publisher=[[Newsday]] |date=May 23, 2014 |accessdate=June 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:An ellipse with auxiliary circle.svg|thumb|right|200px |A circle of radius ''a'' compressed to an ellipse.]] 
[[File:Ellipsoid revolution oblate aab auxiliary sphere.svg|thumb|right|200px |A sphere of radius ''a'' compressed to an oblate ellipsoid of revolution.]]
'''Flattening''' is a measure of the compression of a [[circle]] or [[sphere]] along a diameter to form an [[ellipse]] or an [[ellipsoid]] of revolution ([[spheroid]]) respectively. Other terms used are '''ellipticity''', or '''oblateness'''. The usual notation for flattening is ''f'' and its definition in terms of the semi-axes of the resulting ellipse or ellipsoid is
::&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{flattening} = f =\frac {a - b}{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

The compression factor is ''b/a'' in each case. For the ellipse, this factor is also the aspect ratio of the ellipse.

There are two other variants of flattening (see below) and when it is necessary to avoid confusion the above flattening is called the '''first flattening'''. The following definitions may be found in standard texts&lt;ref name=maling&gt;{{cite book | last=Maling |first=Derek Hylton | title=Coordinate Systems and Map Projections |edition=2nd |year=1992 | publisher =[[Pergamon Press]]|location=Oxford; New York |isbn=0-08-037233-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=snyder&gt;{{cite book |author=Snyder, John P. | title=Map Projections: A Working Manual |series=U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper |volume=1395 | year=1987| publisher =[[United States Government Printing Office]] |location=Washington, D.C. |url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/pubs/pp/pp1395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=torge&gt;Torge, W.

== Definitions of flattening ==
In the following, ''a'' is the larger dimension (e.g. semimajor axis), whereas ''b'' is the smaller (semiminor axis).  All flattenings are zero for a circle (''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b'').

==Identities involving flattening==
The flattenings are related to other parameters of the ellipse. For example:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
b&amp;=a(1-f)=a\left(\frac{1-n}{1+n}\right),\\
 e^2&amp;=2f-f^2 = \frac{4n}{(1+n)^2}.\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]].

==Numerical values for planets==
For the [[WGS84]] ellipsoid to model [[Earth]], the ''defining'' values are&lt;ref&gt;[http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tr8350.2/tr8350_2.html The WGS84 parameters are listed in the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency publication TR8350.2] page 3-1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
::''a'' (equatorial radius): 6 378 137.0&amp;nbsp;m
:: 1/''f'' (inverse flattening): 298.257 223 563
from which one derives
:: ''b'' (polar radius): 6 356 752.3142&amp;nbsp;m,
so that the difference of the major and minor semi-axes is {{convert|21.385|km|0|abbr=on}}. (This is only &amp;nbsp;0.335% of the major axis, so a representation of Earth on a computer screen would be sized as 300px by 299px. Because this would be virtually indistinguishable from a sphere shown as 300px by 300px, illustrations typically greatly exaggerate the flattening in cases where the image needs to represent Earth's oblateness.)

Other values in the Solar System are [[Jupiter]], &amp;nbsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/16; [[Saturn]], &amp;nbsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/10, the [[Moon]] &amp;nbsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/900. The flattening of the [[Sun]] is about {{val|9|e=-6}}.

==Origin of flattening==
In 1687, [[Isaac Newton]] published the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' in which he included a proof that a rotating self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an oblate [[ellipsoid]] of revolution (a [[spheroid]]).&lt;ref name=newton&gt;Isaac Newton:''Principia'' Book III Proposition XIX Problem III, p. 407 in [https://archive.org/stream/ost-physics-newtonspmathema00newtrich/newtonspmathema00newtrich#page/n411/mode/2up Andrew Motte translation]&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of flattening depends on the [[density]] and  the balance of [[gravitational force]] and [[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]].

'''Formula Student''' is a student engineering competition held annually in the UK. Student teams from around the world design, build, test, and race a small-scale [[formula racing|formula style]] racing car. The cars are judged on a number of criteria as listed below. It is run by the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] and uses the same rules as the original [[Formula SAE]] with supplementary regulations.

Ambassadors of Formula Student include [[David Brabham]], [[Paddy Lowe]], Willem Toet, [[Leena Gade]], [[Dallas Campbell]], [[Mike Gascoyne]], and [[James Allison (motorsport)|James Allison]].

==Class definitions==
There are two entry classes in Formula Student, designed to allow progressive learning.

===Class 1===
This is the main event, where teams compete with the cars they have designed and built. Teams are judged across 6 categories and must pass a rigorous inspection by judges before being allowed to compete for the dynamic events. There are usually 100-120 teams in this class.

===Class 2===
This is a concept class for teams who only have a project and plan for a Class 1 car. It can include any parts or work that has been completed in the project so far but this is not necessary. Teams are judged on business presentation, cost and design. Schools can enter both Class 1 and Class 2 cars, allowing Class 2 to be used for inexperienced students to practise their development in advance of a full Class 1 entry.

===Class 1A (pre-2012)===
[[File:Dut13.jpg|thumb|The 13th car of [[DUT Racing]], the Formula Student team from the [[Delft University of Technology]]]]

This was an alternative fueled class with the emphasis placed upon the environmental impact of racing. A car from the previous year's Class 1 entry could be re-entered and re-engineered allowing the students to concentrate on the low carbon aspect of the competition without having to redesign a new chassis and ancillaries. Cars in Class 1A were judged in the same events alongside Class 1 however the cost category was replaced by one for sustainability and the endurance event had a greater emphasis placed upon measured emissions. Class 1A cars were scored and ranked independently of Class 1. Since 2012, both Petroleum and Alternative fueled cars have competed for places in the same rankings.

===Class 2A (pre-2012)===
This was a concept class for teams who only had a project and plan for a Class 1A car. It could include any physical parts or work that had been completed for the project so far, but was not essential. Teams were judged on business presentation, cost and design. Schools could enter both Class 1A and Class 2A teams, with Class 2A allowing inexperienced students to gain competition experience in preparation for a full Class 1A entry.

==Judging==
The cars are judged by industry specialists on the following criteria:

===Static Events===
*Engineering Design (150 points)
* Cost &amp; Sustainability Analysis (100 points)
* Business Presentation (75 points)
*Technical Inspection (comprising 6 tests): Safety, Chassis, Noise, Tilt, Brake, and Tech (no points)

===Dynamic Events===
*Skidpad (Figure of 8) (50 points)
*1&amp;nbsp;km Autocross/Sprint (150 points)
*75m acceleration (75 points)
*22&amp;nbsp;km endurance (300 points) and fuel economy (100 points)

The winner of the event is the team with the highest number of points out of a maximum of 1000.&lt;ref&gt;Formula Student 2013 Rules&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venues==
The first event was held at the [[Motor Industry Research Association]] (MIRA) proving ground in 1998. Following that, the event was held for three years at the [[NEC Birmingham]] between 1999 and 2001. The event was then held on the Go-Kart track at [[Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome]] between 2002 and 2006, before moving to [[Silverstone Circuit]] in 2007 where the competition remains until this day. The dynamic events have taken place on Luffield and Brooklands corners in the past but 2012 saw Copse corner and the National Circuit pit straight being used.

The '''GESIS – Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences''' headquartered in [[Mannheim]] with a location in [[Cologne]] is the largest German infrastructure institute for the [[social sciences]]. With basic research-based services and consulting covering all levels of the scientific process, GESIS supports researchers in the social sciences. As of 2017, the president of GESIS is Christof Wolf.

GESIS is part of the [[Leibniz Association]] and receives federal and state funding.

== History ==
Established in 1986 as ''German Social Science Infrastructure Services'' (German: "Gesellschaft Sozialwissenschaftlicher Infrastruktureinrichtungen"), GESIS originally consisted of the three independent institutes Social Science Information Centre (IZ) in Bonn, Central Archive for Empirical Social Research in Cologne (ZA), and Centre for Survey Research and Methodology (ZUMA) in Mannheim.

In 2007 the three GESIS institutes merged into one. In November 2008 GESIS added "Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences" to its name in order to emphasize its membership in the Leibniz Association.

In November 2011, GESIS Bonn and Cologne were merged into one location in Cologne.

'''George Freedman''' ([[Brooklyn]], New York, USA, 6 March 1936 - Sydney, NSW, Australia, 21 July 2016) was Australia's ''leading'' Interior Designer/ Interior Architect from 1970 until a younger generation became prominent in Sydney during the 1990s. Born in New York, where he studied architecture at Syracuse University, Freedman arrived in Sydney in 1968 and later designed many prestigious interiors, often including custom-made furniture. His notable interior schemes included executive suites for the Bank of New South Wales (1970) and the State Bank of NSW (1985), cultural institutions including Sydney's Powerhouse Museum/Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences (1988), businesses, government premises, restaurants, residences and historic monuments, including a refurbishment of the Queen Victoria Building shopping centre (2009)[3].

In 2005, Freedman was described by The Sydney Morning Herald as ‘the Godfather of Interior Design’. He was recognised by design and architecture industry experts for his daring and widely emulated combinations of colours, inventive uses of materials, attention to detail, and commitment to high-quality furnishings (often imported signature classics)[5]. He was respected also for his sophisticated understandings of optical perception and volumetric manipulations of interior space. For this reason he was highlighted by design writers as practising more like an architect than his colleagues who were educated as interior decorators and designers[6]. Although he never finalised his American degree studies to register as an architect, Freedman worked repeatedly with Sydney's leading architects of the late-twentieth century—including Glenn Murcutt, Peter Stronach, Richard Johnson and Ken Woolley. He also trained some of Sydney's outstanding younger architects and designers—including Iain Halliday, Sam Marshall, Stephen Varady, William MacMahon, Arthur Collin, Robert Puflett, Tim Allison and his late-career partner, Ralph Rembel. In 2005 the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (NSW Chapter) awarded Freedman Rembel an Interior Architecture commendation for its design of executive offices at the AMP Insurance building overlooking Circular Quay.

Freedman's 1970s and 1980s furniture designs, often finished with luxury European veneers and eye-catching flourishes, were often promoted in Australia's most stylish design magazines, especially Belle and Interior Design. His cocktail trolley for Bilson's restaurant (1988) is in the collection of Sydney's Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences. He was a Fellow of the Design Institute of Australia and the Academy of Design Australia.

==Early life==

Freedman was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Nathan Freedman, a colour designer for an American paint manufacturer, and Rose Freedman (née Hirsch). His childhood memories included riding horses in Manhattan's Central Park, and their home interior paint colour was changed every second year to challenging new colours.

==Education==

From 1949 to 1953, Freedman attended Manhattan High School, then studied architecture at Syracuse University and began working from 1960 with architects Kahn and Jacobs, where he worked on the American Airlines’ first class lounge at John F. Kennedy Airport. He abandoned the final year of his degree to travel to Europe; initially Ibiza, with a friend. During 1963 and 1964, he exhibited and sold artworks in Amsterdam and Brussels, then worked as an interior designer for architects Tandy Halford and Mills in London.
Returning to New York in 1968, Freedman joined the international planning unit of leading furniture manufacturers and interior designers Knoll and Associates. He worked with director Florence Knoll, who maintained close ties with many European and American leaders of modern design. Freedman's projects with Knoll included the United States pavilion for the 1970 Osaka World Fair and offices for accountants Price Waterhouse in Buffalo, NY.

==Life in Australia==

In 1969, Knoll despatched Freedman to Sydney to ‘Manhattanise and Internationalise’ the executive and boardrooms for the Bank of New South Wales, one of Australia's oldest banks (founded in 1817 and renamed Westpac in 1982).

While working on this project, Freedman began a personal relationship with prominent Sydney decorator Neville Marsh—who employed him as a designer with Neville Marsh Interiors in 1970. To exploit Freedman's international experience, they agreed that the practice should ‘go modern’, and in 1973, the business was rebranded Marsh Freedman Associates (MFA).

As well as designing interiors for some of Sydney's most prestigious and prosperous families, MFA created sophisticated fine dining rooms for some of Sydney's outstanding restaurateurs, notably Anne Taylor (Taylors, 1984); Tony and Gay Bilson (Berowra Waters Inn, 1976; Kinselas, 1983; Tresury, 1992, and Ampersand, 1998; Damien and Josephine Pignolet (Claudes, 1981); Helen and Malcolm Spry (Chez Oz, 1985); Leon Fink (Bilsons and Quay, 1986, 1988), and Armando Percuoco (Buon Ricordo Ristorante refurbishment, 2007).

During the late 1980s, Neville Marsh retired from Marsh Freedman Associates and Freedman continued to practice as George Freedman Associates (with Robert Chester and Sam Marshall). In 2002 he appointed a younger architect, Ralph Rembel, as his business partner and renamed the practice 'Freedman Rembel'. This practice was dissolved in 2010, when Freedman joined architects Peddle Thorp and Walker as Head of Interior Design (but he continued consulting to his existing private clients).

==Personal life==

Freedman was widely known for his waspish wit, warm laugh, home cooking, Negroni's, and devotion to his dogs (owned in pairs shared). During the 1990s Freedman was caring for Neville Marsh and supported by Andrew Bryan. In 2005 he met and later exchanged vows in Paris with psychologist Peter O'Brien. In 2014 they had a formal same sex wedding in New Zealand. Freedman died from cancer in Sydney in 2016, aged 80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amy|first1=Ripley|title=George Freedman, interior designer to the rich and famous of Sydney|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/george-freedman-interior-designer-to-the-rich-and-famous-of-sydney-20160811-gqqc4n.html|website=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''glass sea creatures''' (alternately called the ''Blaschka sea creatures'', ''glass marine invertebrates'', and ''Blaschka invertebrate models'') are works of [[glass art]]ists [[Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka]]. The spiritual predecessors of the [[Glass Flowers]], the sea creatures were the output of the Blaschkas' successful mail-order business of supplying museums and private collectors around the world with sets of [[glass]] models of [[marine invertebrates]].

Between 1863 and 1880, the Blaschkas – working in [[Dresden]] – executed at least 10,000 of these highly detailed glass models, representing some 700 different [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;Crystal Sarakas, [http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/lifestyle/art/2016/08/06/corning-exhibit-peeks-undersea-world-glass/87749928/ Corning exhibit shows sea creatures in glass], ''[[Democrat &amp; Chronicle]]'' (August 6, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of large collections of the models are held by museums and other academic institutions.

==Inspiration==
[[File:Rudolf, Leopold and Caroline Blaschka in garden.tif|thumb|Rudolf (standing), Caroline, and Leopold Blaschka in the garden of their Dresden home]]

In 1853, shortly after the death of his father and wife Caroline, the latter to a cholera epidemic, Leopold Blaschka – grief stricken and in need of a vacation – traveled to the United States. En route, however, and the ship was becalmed and lay still upon the sea for two weeks.&lt;ref name="cmog.org"&gt;[http://www.cmog.org/article/blaschkas-glass-models-invertebrate-animals-1863-1890 Corning Museum of Glass: Blaschkas' Glass Models of Invertebrate Animals (1863–1890)]&lt;/ref&gt; During this period of forced idleness, Leopold studied and sketched the local marine [[invertebrate]] population, intrigued by the transparency of their bodies which was next of kin to the glass his family had long worked.&lt;ref name="archived 2002-09-10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urania-dresden.de/Blaschka_engl.html |title=Förderverein "Naturwissenschaftliche Glaskunst Blaschka-Haus e.

Translation by Peter Silbernagl. Lead sentence: "In September 2000, an association was founded in Dresden-Hosterwitz with the aim to establish a museum-type memorial for the work of Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka and to treasure the memory of those two glass-artists." &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; Earliest English-language title: The Association "Naturwissenschaftliche Glaskunst – Blaschka-Haus e.V.". Johanna Dühning, Chairman of the Association; translation by Benjamin Pentzold ().&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Leopold felt a sense of quiet, inspirational, wonder at these luminescent ocean dwellers, a sense which he recorded and has been since translated by a Henri Reiling: ''"It is a beautiful night in May. Hopeful, we look out over the darkness of the sea, which is as smooth as a mirror; there emerges all around in various places a flashlike bundle of light beams, as if it is surrounded by thousands of sparks, that form true bundles of fire and of other bright lighting spots, and the seemingly mirrored stars. There emerges close before us a small spot in a sharp greenish light, which becomes ever larger and larger and finally becomes a bright shining sunlike figure."''&lt;ref name="cmog.org"/&gt;

This sense of wonder would fuel his later work but, in the meantime and upon his return to [[Dresden]], Leopold focused on his family business which was the production the glass eyes, costume ornaments, lab equipment, and other such fancy goods and specialty items that only a master [[Lampworking|Lampworker]] could accomplish;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Harvard University Herbaria and Botany Libraries&lt;/ref&gt; plus the task of furthering the training of his son and apprentice (and eventual successor), Rudolf Blaschka. However, like anyone, he did have free time, and his hobby was to make glass models of plants – as opposed to invertebrates. This would, many years later, become a base for the fabled ''Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants'' (otherwise known as the Glass Flowers), but, for the moment, such artistry was naught but an amusing and profitless pastime done between his various commissions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Yet, unsurprisingly given their stunning quality, this amusing hobby – itself born out of seeking consolation in nature upon his wife's death – attracted attention. Aristocratic attention, as it turned out, specifically the eyes of Prince Camille de [[House of Rohan|Rohan]] who, being something of a naturalist himself, commissioned the Blaschkas to craft 100 glass [[orchid]]s for his private collection.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;"Leopold + Rudolf Blaschka {...} The Glass Aquarium {...}". Design Museum (designmuseum.org). Retrieved 2015-06-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally the Prince was more than a little impressed by the mastery Leopold's work, and "between 1860 and 1862, the prince exhibited about 100 models of orchids and other exotic plants, which he displayed on two artificial tree trunks in his palace in Prague,"&lt;ref name="cmog.org"/&gt; a fateful act which brought the skill of the Blaschkas to the attention of another – man whom the Prince had actually once introduced to Leopold: a certain Professor [[Ludwig Reichenbach]].&lt;ref name="sciencefriday.com"&gt;[http://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/a-tale-of-two-glassworkers-and-their-marine-marvels/ A Tale of Two Glassworkers and Their Marine Marvels]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reichenbach's request==
[[File:Reichenbach Ludwig 1793-1879.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Professor Heinrich Gottlieb Ludwig Reichenbach]]
Director of the natural history museum in Dresden, Prof. Reichenbach was faced with an annoying yet seemingly unsolvable problem in regards to showing marine life. Land-based flora and fauna was not an issue, for it was a relatively simple matter to exhibit mounted and stuffed creatures such as gorillas and elephants, there lifelike poses attracting and exciting the museums visitors. Invertebrates, however, and by their very nature, posed a problem.&lt;ref name="archived 2002-09-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blaschkagallery.mannlib.cornell.edu/intro.php Cornell University]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century the only practiced method of showcasing them was to take a live specimen and place it in a sealed jar of alcohol.&lt;ref name=blaschka_archive&gt;[http://www.cmog.org/research/library/collections/digital/blaschka The Blaschka Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; This of course killed it but, more importantly, time and their lack of hard parts eventually rendered them into little more than colorless floating blobs of jelly. Neither pretty nor a terribly effective teaching tool, Prof. Reichenbach wanted something more, specifically 3D colored models of marine invertebrates that were both lifelike and able to stand the test of time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; And, per remarkably coincidence, in 1863 "saw an exhibition of highly detailed, realistic glass flowers created by a Bohemian lampworker named Leopold Blaschka."&lt;ref name=blaschka_archive/&gt;

[[File:Blaschka 1.jpg|thumb|right|Blaschka model of sea anemones]]

Enchanted by the botanical models and positive that Leopold held the key to ending his own showcasing issue, in 1863&lt;ref name="archived 2002-09-10"/&gt; Reichenbach convinced and commissioned Leopold to produce twelve model [[sea anemone]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sciencefriday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Natural History Berlin, Historical collection of pictures and writings – Katalog über Blaschka's Modelle, L. Blaschka, Dresden, 1885&lt;/ref&gt; These marine models, hailed as "an artistic marvel in the field of science and a scientific marvel in the field of art,"&lt;ref&gt;https://museum.wales/articles/2007-05-15/Sea-creatures-of-the-deep---the-Blaschka-Glass-models/&lt;/ref&gt; were a great improvement on previous methods of presenting such creatures: drawings, pressing, photographs and [[papier-mâché]] or wax models.&lt;ref name="archived 2002-09-10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodyear, Anne Collins, and Weitekamp, Margaret A. Analyzing Art and Aesthetics. Artefacts: Studies in the History of Science and Technology ; v. 9. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and exactly what Prof. Reichenbach needed. Moreover they, at last, provided an outlet for the wonder Leopold had felt all those years ago when observing the phosphorescent ocean life. The key fact, though, was that these glass marine models were, as would soon be acknowledged, "perfectly true to nature,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cmog.org/collection/exhibitions/blaschka Fragile Legacy: The Marine Invertebrate Glass Models of Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka]&lt;/ref&gt; and as such represented an extraordinary opportunity boh for the scientific community and the Blaschkas themselves. Knowing this and thrilled with his newly acquired set of glass sea creatures, Reichenbach advised Leopold to drop his current and generations long family business of glass fancy goods and the like in favor of selling glass marine invertebrates to museums, aquaria, universities, and private collectors.&lt;ref name="archived 2002-09-10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://designmuseum.org/design/leopold-rudolf-blaschka |title=Leopold + Rudolf Blaschka {...} The Glass Aquarium {...} |publisher=[[Design Museum]] (designmuseum.org) |date= |accessdate=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advice which would prove wise and fateful both economically and scientifically, for Leopold did as the Dresden natural history museum director suggested.

==A successful business==
[[File:Blaschka 4.jpg|thumb|left|Blaschka model of jellyfish]]
Unlike the eventual Glass Flower, a private commission to a single University's museum, the Blaschka glass sea creatures were a global enterprise; and not just for museums and other such educational institutes, for "as popular interest in the history and sciences of the natural world burgeoned during the latter half of the 19th century, the sea became particularly alluring. The spread of home aquariums and the advent of deep-sea diving revealed a new frontier, filled with wondrous and unusual creatures."&lt;ref name="news.wisc.edu"&gt;[http://news.wisc.edu/glass-menagerie-museum-unearths-exotic-stash-of-glass-sea-creatures/ University of Wisconsin–Madison: ‘Glass menagerie:’ Museum unearths exotic stash of glass sea creatures]&lt;/ref&gt; In short, for the first time since [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], there was great universal interest in the natural world, and it became a sign of culture, of worldliness and sophistication, to exhibit examples of life in one's drawing rooms and parlors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hmnh.harvard.edu/file/429666 Restoring Blaschka Sea Creatures in Glass]&lt;/ref&gt; Hence private individuals were after these extraordinary models as well, and the Blaschkas, knowing this and knowing that Reichenbach was correct in that many museums would want them, made a mail-order business out of it. This business was hugely successful and they ended up making and selling a believed 10,000 of glass invertebrates dispersed in a diaspora of shipments all across the globe.&lt;ref name="dm.cmog.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2016/10/exhibition-talk-film-explore-sea-glass&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, "the world had never seen anything quite like the beautiful, scientifically accurate Blaschka models"&lt;ref name="atlasobscura.com"&gt;http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-delicate-glass-sea-creatures-of-leopold-and-rudolf-blaschka&lt;/ref&gt; and yet they were available via so common a means as mail-order per one's local card catalog; for example, [[Ward's Natural Science]] would sell a small glass octopus for approximately $2.50.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Not glorious, perhaps, but highly effective, and museums and universities began purchasing them en masse to put on display much as Prof. Reichenbach had – for natural history museums directors the world over had the same marine invertebrate showcasing problem.&lt;ref name="cmog.org"/&gt; In short, Blaschka invertebrate models mail-order enterprise succeeded for two reason: 1- there was a huge and global demand; 2- they were the only and best glass artists capable of crafting literally scientifically flawless models. Initially the designs for these were based on drawings in books, but Leopold was soon able to use his earlier drawings to produce highly detailed models of other species,&lt;ref name="archived 2002-09-10"/&gt; and his reputation quickly spread.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

As Leopold truthfully wrote in an English-language trade catalog (which the Rakow Research Library at The Corning Museum of Glass has thankfully preserved):''"[Models of invertebrate animals] have been purchased by... museums and scholastic establishments in all the quarters of the globe... in New Zealand... in Tokio [sic], Japan... for the Indian Museum in Calcutta... in the United States of America by Professor Ward's Natural Science Establishment in Rochester, New York; for the Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge, Massachusetts; for the Boston Society of Natural History; the University of Cornell; the Wellesley Female College... In Great Britain, Scotland and Ireland, copies have been conveyed to London, Edinburgh and Dublin... In Austria, orders have not only been made for the Imperial Royal Court collection, but also for the universities in Innsbruck, Graz, Czernovitz, and so forth. In Germany, purchases have been made for the universities of Berlin, Bonn, Koenigsberg, Jena, Leipzig, Rostock and many other museums."''&lt;ref name="cmog.org"/&gt; Furthermore, Leopold gradually extended his range of work by studying marine animals from the [[North Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Mediterranean]],&lt;ref name="archived 2002-09-10"/&gt;  and later constructed an aquarium at his house, in order to keep live specimens from which to model.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Yet the fate of the marine invertebrate mail-order business was ultimately to be tied to those bought by [[Harvard University|Harvard's]] [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]]. At some time after the museum's founding in 1859, a collection of 430 glass sea creatures were purchased by either Professor [[Louis Agassiz]], the first director, or his son and successor [[Alexander Agassiz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hmnh.harvard.edu/file/429666 Restoring Blaschka Sea Creatures in Glass]&lt;/ref&gt; This set was not the largest ever sold and the models were no different from any of the others made by the Blaschkas, but, again, their affect was to be greater than all the rest combined.

==From invertebrates to flowers==
{{main article|Glass Flowers}}
[[File:PSM V39 D594 George Lincoln Goodale.jpg|thumb|Professor George Lincoln Goodale|left|150px]]
Paradoxically and in historically circular twist, the reason that the glass sea creatures sold to Harvard were to prove so crucial was because the University would soon, and did, open its new [[Harvard University Herbaria|Botanical Museum]] in 1888. Given in effect a series of empty rooms and invited to make a museum for teaching botany, the first director, Professor [[George Lincoln Goodale]], faced a familiar problem.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; At that time, Harvard was the global center of botanical study and, as such, Prof. Goodale wanted the best for his students, but the only used method was showcasing pressed and carefully labeled botanical specimens – a methodology that offered a twofold problem: being pressed, the specimens were two-dimensional and tended to lose their color.&lt;ref name="hmnh.harvard.edu"&gt;http://hmnh.harvard.edu/glass-flowers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasonline.org"&gt;http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/goodale-george.pdf National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoir&lt;/ref&gt; Hence they were hardly the ideal teaching tools.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In fact, Goodale's problem was essentially the same as Reichenbach's had been, but applied to botany rather than marine biology for, in both cases, the practiced method of exhibition robbed the specimens of color and three-dimensional form.

[[File:GlassFlowers2HMNH.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A glass model of a cactus at the Harvard Museum of Natural History]]

Moreover and also like Prof. Reichenbach, Prof. Goodale first learned of Leopold and Rudolf Blaschkas' skill per an exhibition – that being the glass marine invertebrates belonging to the Museum of Comparative Zoology. And, like Reichenbach, upon seeing the Blaschkas' work Goodale was instantly sure that they held the answer to his showcasing problem. Thus, in yet another direct historical parallel, in 1886 the Blaschkas were approached by Professor Goodale for the sole purpose of finding them, with a request to make a series of glass botanical models for Harvard. Naturally Leopold was initially unwilling as, again, his current business of selling glass marine invertebrates was booming; but, eventually, the famed glass artists agreed to send test-models to the U.S. and, although damaged in customs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmog.org/article/glass-flowers&lt;/ref&gt; the fragments convinced Goodale that Blaschka glass art was a more than worthy educational investment. Thus, with the generous sponsorship of Elizabeth C. Ware and her daughter [[Mary Lee Ware|Mary]], the initial contract was signed and dictated that the Blaschkas need only work half-time on the models, thus allowing them to continue their production of the Glass sea creatures. However, in 1890, they and Goodale – acting on behalf of the Wares – signed an updated version that allowed Leopold and Rudolf to work on them (the Glass Flowers) full-time;&lt;ref name=schultes&gt;Schultes, Richard Evans., William A. Davis, and Hillel Burger. The Glass Flowers at Harvard. New York: Dutton, 1982.

Drawing upon Nature: Studies for the Blaschkas' Glass Models. Corning, NY: Corning Museum of Glass, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the production and time of the Glass sea creatures was over, their fame as well as the attention of their makers shifting to the Glass Flowers – a project that, fifty years later, ended with the death of Rudolf Blaschka (Leopold having died thirty-nine years earlier).

==The models today==
Today, over a century after their making, the Glass sea creatures live in the shadow of their younger botanical cousins, so much so that many of those well aware of the Glass Flowers have never even heard of them. The fact is that, "gradually, these glass animals began to disappear, their habitats shifting into dusty closets and museum storage. People began to forget that these incredible glass creations had existed in the first place."&lt;ref name="atlasobscura.com"/&gt;

===Corning===
With a collection 700 models bought in 1888,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cmog.org/collection/exhibitions/blaschka Fragile Legacy: The Marine Invertebrate Glass Models of Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka]&lt;/ref&gt; the Corning Museum of Glass boasts the largest known stash of Blaschka sea creatures. Displayed (at least in part) in an exhibition named ''Fragile Legacy'', "researchers at Cornell are using the collection as a time capsule for seeking out and documenting the creatures still living in our oceans today." In addition, Corning's exhibit allows visitors to try their own hands at crafting glass sea slugs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmog.org/fragile-legacy Fragile Legacy]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as view subsequent works inspired by the Blaschkas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmog.org/set/inspired-blaschka Inspired by Blaschka]&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibit is open through January 8, 2017. Finally, Corning Museum of Glass has produced a movie entitled [http://fragilelegacy.info/ Fragile Legacy] exploring the related topics of the Glass sea creatures and the living ones they represent.

===Harvard===

Even those specimens purchased by Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ) suffered a degree of neglect; they were not forgotten, but they were scattered much as the quote above describes, across several departments, and it was believed that the University only possessed 60-70 models (rather than the actual 430).&lt;ref&gt;[http://hmnh.harvard.edu/file/429666 Restoring Blaschka Sea Creatures in Glass]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently Harvard has restored and, to best of their abilities, repaired the Glass sea creatures with the hired and instrumental help of Preservation Specialist and Glass Worker Elizabeth R.

Today they form the [[Harvard Museum of Natural History]] ''Sea Creatures in Glass'' display which, when combined with the Glass Flowers, form the largest Blaschka collection on display in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hmnh.harvard.edu/file/429666 Restoring Blaschka Sea Creatures in Glass]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Harvard's renovation exhibit====
For a several month period beginning in 2015 and set to end in the early summer of 2016, the HMNH set up a "temporary display highlighting twenty-seven of the most popular plant models as well as some items from the Blaschka archives"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Glass Flowers Renovation Project Frequently Asked Questions (Harvard University Herbaria and Botany Libraries)&lt;/ref&gt; while the main Glass Flowers exhibit was under renovation. This exhibit was unique because it was the first recorded time that the Glass Flowers have been jointly exhibited with the Glass sea creatures in a major and equal display.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The renovation exhibit was dismantled when, on May 21, 2016, the main Glass Flowers exhibit reopened. The Glass sea creatures remained as a permanent exhibit.

===Cornell===
In 1885 Andrew Dixon White, first president of [[Cornell University]], authorized purchase of 570 glass marine invertebrates,&lt;ref name="fragilelegacy.info"&gt;http://fragilelegacy.info/&lt;/ref&gt; "some of which are on exhibit at Corson Mudd Hall and the Herbert F. Johnson Museum, making Cornell one of the few universities in the world where students and the public can view these wondrous creations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blaschkagallery.mannlib.cornell.edu/history.php Cornell University: History of the Blaschka Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; However and like so many of their counterpart collections, they were neglected after a time and, in this case, remained forgotten under dust and grit until the latter half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="fragilelegacy.info"/&gt; Currently Cornell has restored approximately 170 of the models thus far and "restoration work will continue as funding allows."&lt;ref&gt;http://blaschkagallery.mannlib.cornell.edu/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Museum of Ireland===
The [[Natural History Museum (Ireland)|Natural History Museum]] branch of the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in [[Dublin]] was among the Blaschkas' "earliest customers and initially commissioned 85 glass models, paying the then significant sum of £15. It went on to purchase 530 models from the Blaschkas" – making it the largest collection of Blaschka Invertebrate Models in Europe&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/the-glass-menagerie-1.1005588 The glass menagerie (The Irish Times)]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Dead Zoo, as Ireland's Natural History Museum is sometimes called,&lt;ref name="archiseek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ireland.archiseek.com/buildings_ireland/dublin/southcity/merrion_square/naturalhistorymuseum.html |title=Natural History Museum, Merrion Square, Dublin |last=Clerkin |first=Paul |work=Architecture of Ireland |publisher=Archiseek |accessdate=2009-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120035015/http://ireland.archiseek.com/buildings_ireland/dublin/southcity/merrion_square/naturalhistorymuseum.html |archivedate=2008-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2006/05/27/d605272103134.htm|title=Notes on Dublin|last=Hoque|first=Abeer|date=2006-05-27|work=The Daily Star|accessdate=2009-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; "has undertaken research on the conservation of these delicate objects."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.ie/The-Collections/Natural-History/The-Collections/Blaschka-Glass-Models Blaschka Glass]&lt;/ref&gt; Noteworthy in that, like Corning, they have forever taken excellent care of the Sea Creatures, the National Museum of Ireland is another center of learning regarding the Blaschkas; a fact proven in that, in 2006, they hosted (alongside [[University College Dublin]]) the [[Dublin Blaschka Congress]], "conceived as a gathering to bring together the diverse scholarly disciplines that are uniquely, if eccentrically, joined in the study of scientific glass models."&lt;ref&gt;Sigwart, Julia D. "Crystal creatures: context for the Dublin Blaschka Congress." Historical Biology 20.1 (2008): 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Crucially and naturally, the Congress dealt with the Glass Flowers no less than their older maritime cousins.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Dublin Blaschka Congress, special issue, Historical Biology 20 no. 1 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Wisconsin–Madison===
In 2007 the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] Zoological Museum accidentally uncovered their hitherto forgotten 50-model collection in a "series of keyholes under the exhibit cases along a first-floor corridor&lt;ref name="news.wisc.edu"/&gt; Paula Holahan, one of the curators and the one who made the incredible discovery, correctly states that "It's not uncommon to find things packed away in any museum that is over 100 years old." But, regardless, the years have taken their toll and the specimens, currently too brittle to be publicly displayed, must remain in storage until conservation measures are funded and completed. Sadly though these funds are not materializing, so the museum hopes to one willing to sponsor the restoration before the effects of age become irreversible.&lt;ref name="news.wisc.edu"/&gt;

===Natural History Museum, Wollaston Hall, Nottingham, England===
There is a large display of marine invertebrates  and also two models of single cell animals living in fresh water.

==Lost works==
Many of the Glass sea creatures are yet to be located; the Leopolds' record books tell where many of the shipments went,&lt;ref&gt;https://dm.cmog.org/blaschka/blaschka_web.html&lt;/ref&gt; yet the condition and current whereabouts of the majority of these collections remains unknown. The original six glass sea anemones purchased by Professor Reichenbach in 1863 as well as the rest of that first collection were destroyed in the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Natural History Berlin, Historical collection of pictures and writings – Katalog über Blaschka's Modelle, L.

==History==
Graceland University was established as Graceland College in 1895 by the RLDS Church in Lamoni, Iowa. Land for the college was donated by church members, with the first 20 acres given by [[Marietta Walker]]. The name "Graceland" was selected by Col. George Barrett, land surveyor for the college, for the graceful slope of the hill upon which the college was built. Until the administration building was completed, classes were conducted in a building in downtown Lamoni. The first day of classes was September 17, 1895. 

In 1917, Graceland received accreditation from the states of Iowa and Missouri and from the North Central Association of Colleges, making it the first fully accredited junior college in Iowa. Graceland became a four-year college in 1960. Graceland's nursing program began in 1910 as a cooperative program with the Independence Sanitarium and Hospital, Independence, MO. The Graceland campus was extended to Independence with the establishment of the college's bachelor's degree program in 1968-69.

The Graceland Partnership Program, offering degree-completion programs on community college campuses, was established in 1989. In 1995, Graceland acquired SkillPath, a business training company that offers seminars and classes. Graceland College became Graceland University on June 1, 2000.

==Chapel==
[[File:Cheville Chapel300.jpg|right|framed|Roy A. Cheville Chapel at Graceland University, Lamoni, Iowa, dedicated 1978]]The Cheville Chapel was dedicated in 1978 in honor of [[Roy Cheville]], theologian, educator and former [[Presiding Patriarch (Mormonism)|Presiding Patriarch]] of the [[Community of Christ]]. The structure was built for $325,000 and was funded by a restricted private bequest. In keeping with the desire for the [[chapel]] to be an accessible place of solitude, Graceland's president Frank Hough determined that the facility should remain unstaffed and open at all times.

The Chapel's relatively small [[seating capacity]] makes it an intimate setting for worship, theological education and the performance of [[sacred music]]. Known for its excellent [[acoustics]], it has been used for small ensemble performances. It is used several times a week by campus groups for [[worship]] services, and as a place of individual [[prayer]] and reflection. 

Architecturally, the [[postmodern]] brick structure is [[minimalist]] in its design. It is reminiscent of the exterior simplicity of the [[Rothko Chapel]] in Houston built only a few years earlier, while its twin [[steeple (architecture)|steeple]] foreshadows the [[deconstructivism]] style in architecture that began a decade later. The chapel houses Aaron Sherer's "The Process of Becoming," a canvas wall hanging employing a mix of colorfully painted ribbons.

==Student life==
=== Residence life ===
Instead of having fraternities and sororities like many universities, Graceland has residential social organizations called "Houses." These Houses are present on Graceland’s main campus; however, the Independence campus does have its own House, McKevit Manor. Students are assigned to a House regardless whether they live on or off campus. Graceland has six men’s Houses: Agape, Cheville, Closson, Faunce, Orion, and Stewart Manor. Graceland has nine female Houses: Amici, Aponivi, Dimora, Hanthorne, Khiyah, Paloma, Sariah, Shalom, and Solah.&lt;ref name=Lead&gt;[http://www.graceland.edu/Campus-Life/Leadership%20&amp;%20Service/index Campus Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126010217/http://www.graceland.edu/Campus-Life/Leadership%20%26%20Service/index |date=2012-11-26 }} "Leadership &amp; Service." Graceland University. N.p., n.d. Web. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each House has officers who serve on Graceland’s Student Government. The officers form a “House Council,” including a House President (who leads the House Council), a Campus Organization of Social Activities (COSA) representative, an Academic Student Council (ASC) representative, a senator, an intramural sports representative and a chaplain. Members of the House Council are elected to their positions by members of their House. In addition to their Student Government duties, House Council members plan social activities called “functions.” These functions vary by House and range from formal dinners to campouts.&lt;ref name=Lead/&gt;

Houses hold meetings every Tuesday at 10 p.m. Meetings are led by the House President and House Council and vary widely from House to House.&lt;ref name=Lead/&gt;

=== Activities and organizations ===
Graceland has over 50 clubs and organizations for students. Between Graceland Student Government and the campus clubs and organizations, over 250 official leadership positions are available.&lt;ref name=Orgs&gt;[http://www.graceland.edu/Campus-Life/Get-Involved/index Activities and Organizations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115174941/http://graceland.edu/Campus-Life/Get-Involved/index |date=2013-01-15 }} "Get Involved." Graceland University. N.p., n.d. Web. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Graceland Student Government is a popular student activity, particularly for sophomore and junior students on campus.&lt;ref name=Orgs/&gt;

Intramurals is perhaps the campus’ most popular activity, with over 98 percent student participation. Intramural teams are divided by House and level of competition.&lt;ref name=Orgs/&gt;

Other popular student clubs include the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), International Club, Outreach International club, Enactus, Art Student Society and Sustainability Club.&lt;ref name=Orgs/&gt;

=== Performing arts ===
With the completion of the Shaw Center expansion in fall 2012, Graceland has placed a renewed emphasis on the performing arts. Graceland performance groups include Chamber Singers, Concert Choir, Oratorio Chorus, Jazz Band, Pep Band, Symphonic Band, Orchestra and Theatre. For the 2012-2013 academic year, Graceland doubled its number of annual theatre productions. Over 1/3 of Graceland student participate in the arts (both visual and performing).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graceland.edu/Academics/College-and-Schools/College-of-Liberal-Arts-and-Sciences/Division-of-Visual--Performing-Arts/index Performing Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107065614/http://www.graceland.edu/Academics/College-and-Schools/College-of-Liberal-Arts-and-Sciences/Division-of-Visual--Performing-Arts/index |date=2012-01-07 }} "Come express yourself at Graceland University."

=== School traditions ===
'''House Meeting'''

Every Tuesday at 10:00 p.m. student gather with their fellow House members in a weekly meeting. Meetings are led by the House President and involve House Council members. Meetings vary from House to House, but generally include recreational activities and announcements from House Council members. Meetings are generally held in House lounges.&lt;ref name=David&gt;Goehner, David. The Graceland College Book of Knowledge. Independence: Herald Publishing House, 1997. 168-69. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Airband'''

Every year at Graceland’s annual Homecoming weekend, COSA puts on an annual Airband competition. Male Houses are paired with female Houses (brother/sister Houses) and the teams compete against each other in a choreographed dance competition. Houses spend weeks preparing props, themes, and storylines for the competition; then perform their routine before a panel of judges. The winner of Airband is awarded points, and the team with the most Homecoming points wins money for their House.&lt;ref name=David/&gt;

'''New Years in November'''

Every year in mid-November, COSA sponsors a campuswide dance and celebration, called New Year’s in November. The event is essentially a celebration of the coming new year, because students are not on campus for New Year’s Eve. The event has a specific theme every year and includes dancing and other activities. The event traditionally ends with a pancake breakfast in the Commons.&lt;ref name=David/&gt;

'''Final Fling'''

The final weekend of the semester, COSA sponsors a campuswide celebration for students. Events vary year to year, but often include inflatables, sports tournaments, and various entertainment acts. Students collect wristbands for each event they attend, and at the weekend’s conclusion enter their wristbands in a drawing for prizes.&lt;ref name=David/&gt;

'''Thursday Night Movie'''

Once a week, COSA plays a free movie in the local theatre, The Coliseum. Before 2012, the movie played on Wednesdays; however the day was changed in fall 2012 to accommodate Graceland Student Government meetings.&lt;ref name=David/&gt;

Following this Canters won a scholarship to study for a doctorate at the University of Sunderland under the supervision of Dr. [[Pamela Sue Anderson]] and others.

Her thesis was a study of the Belgian feminist philosopher and former Lacanian psychoanalyst [[Luce Irigaray]], in particular her book ''Elemental Passions''.

'''Interior design''' is the [[art]] and [[science]] of enhancing the interior of a [[building]] to achieve a healthier and more aesthetically pleasing environment for the people using the space. An '''interior designer''' is someone who plans, researches, coordinates, and manages such projects. Interior design is a multifaceted profession that includes conceptual development, space planning, site inspections, programming, research, communicating with the stakeholders of a project, construction management, and execution of the design.

==History and current terms==
[[Image:Vlkolínec, Slovakia 020.jpg|thumb|right|Typical interior of one of the houses in the Folk Architecture Reservation in [[Vlkolínec]] ([[Slovakia]])]]
In the past, interiors were put together instinctively as a part of the process of building.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;Pile, J., 2003, Interior Design, 3rd edn, Pearson, New Jersey, USA&lt;/ref&gt; The profession of interior design has been a consequence of the development of society and the complex [[architecture]] that has resulted from the development of industrial processes. The pursuit of effective use of space, user well-being and functional design has contributed to the development of the contemporary interior design profession. The profession of interior design is separate and distinct from the role of ''interior decorator'', a term commonly used in the US. The term is less common in the UK where the profession of interior design is still unregulated and therefore, strictly speaking, not yet officially a profession.

In ancient India, architects used to work as interior designers. This can be seen from the references of Vishwakarma the architect - one of the gods in Indian mythology. Additionally, the sculptures depicting ancient texts and events are seen in palaces built in 17th-century India.

In ancient Egypt, "soul houses" or models of houses were placed in tombs as receptacles for food offerings.  From these, it is possible to discern details about the interior design of different residences throughout the different Egyptian dynasties, such as changes in ventilation, porticoes, columns, loggias, windows, and doors.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore, R.G. ''History of Interior Design Furniture: From Ancient Egypt to Nineteenth-Century Europe''. J. Wiley, 2006, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 17th and 18th century and into the early 19th century, interior decoration was the concern of the homemaker, or an employed [[upholsterer]] or craftsman who would advise on the artistic style for an interior space. Architects would also employ craftsmen or artisans to complete interior design for their buildings.

===Commercial interior design and management===
In the mid-to-late 19th century, interior design services expanded greatly, as the [[middle class]] in [[industrial revolution|industrial]] countries grew in size and prosperity and began to desire the domestic trappings of wealth to cement their new status. Large [[furniture]] firms began to branch out into general interior design and management, offering full house furnishings in a variety of styles. This business model flourished from the mid-century to 1914, when this role was increasingly usurped by independent, often amateur, designers. This paved the way for the emergence of the professional interior design in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name="wiley"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Clive|date=4 February 2013|title=Complete House Furnishers: The Retailer as Interior Designer in Nineteenth-Century London|journal=Journal of Interior Design|volume=38|pages=1–17|doi=10.1111/joid.12000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shoolbred catalogue.jpg|thumb|Illustrated catalog of the [[James Shoolbred|James Shoolbred Company]], published in 1876.]]
In the 1950s and 1960s, upholsterers began to expand their business remits. They framed their business more broadly and in artistic terms and began to advertise their furnishings to the public. To meet the growing demand for contract interior work on projects such as [[office]]s, [[hotel]]s, and [[public building]]s, these businesses became much larger and more complex, employing builders, joiners, plasterers, textile designers, artists, and furniture designers, as well as engineers and technicians to fulfil the job. Firms began to publish and circulate [[Trade literature|catalogs]] with prints for different lavish styles to attract the attention of expanding middle classes.&lt;ref name="wiley" /&gt;

As department stores increased in number and size, retail spaces within shops were furnished in different styles as examples for customers. One particularly effective advertising tool was to set up model rooms at national and international [[exhibition]]s in showrooms for the public to see. Some of the pioneering firms in this regard were [[Waring &amp; Gillow]], [[James Shoolbred]], [[Mintons]], and Holland &amp; Sons. These traditional high-quality furniture making firms began to play an important role as advisers to unsure middle class customers on taste and style, and began taking out contracts to design and furnish the interiors of many important buildings in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rca.ac.uk/Default.aspx?ContentID=156993&amp;CategoryID=36646|title=Amanda Girling-Budd’s Statement|accessdate=2012-12-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829143857/http://rca.ac.uk/Default.aspx?ContentID=156993&amp;CategoryID=36646|archive-date=2012-08-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of firm emerged in America after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The [[Herter Brothers]], founded by two German emigre brothers, began as an upholstery warehouse and became one of the first firms of furniture makers and [[interior decorator]]s. With their own design office and cabinet-making and upholstery workshops, Herter Brothers were prepared to accomplish every aspect of interior furnishing including decorative paneling and mantels, wall and ceiling decoration, patterned floors, and carpets and draperies.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Katherine S. ''Herter Brothers: Furniture and Interiors for a Gilded Age.'' Harry N. Abrams: Metropolitan Museum of Art in association with the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, 1994. {{ISBN|0-8109-3426-4}}.1994&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Wallpaper group-p6m-1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Illustration from ''The Grammar of Ornament'' (1856), by interior designer [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]].]]
A pivotal figure in popularizing theories of interior design to the middle class was the architect [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]], one of the most influential design theorists of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Clouse, Doug. "The Handy Book of Artistic Printing: Collection of Letterpress Examples with Specimens of Type, Ornament, Corner Fills, Borders, Twisters, Wrinklers, and other Freaks of Fancy". Princeton Architectural Press, 2009. p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones' first project was his most important—in 1851 he was responsible for not only the decoration of [[Joseph Paxton]]’s gigantic [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] for the [[Great Exhibition]], but also for the arrangement of the exhibits within. He chose a controversial [[color theory|palette]] of red, yellow, and blue for the interior ironwork and, despite initial negative publicity in the newspapers, was eventually unveiled by [[Queen Victoria]] to much critical acclaim. His most significant publication was ''The Grammar of Ornament'' (1856),&lt;ref&gt;Clouse, Doug. "The Handy Book of Artistic Printing: Collection of Letterpress Examples with Specimens of Type, Ornament, Corner Fills, Borders, Twisters, Wrinklers, and other Freaks of Fancy". Princeton Architectural Press, 2009. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; in which Jones formulated 37 key principles of interior design and decoration.

Jones was employed by some of the leading interior design firms of the day; in the 1860s he worked in collaboration with the London firm Jackson &amp; Graham to produce furniture and other fittings for high-profile clients including art collector [[Alfred Morrison]] and the [[Khedive]] of Egypt, [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail Pasha]].

In 1882, the [[Kelly's Directory|London Directory]] of the [[Post Office]] listed 80 interior decorators. Some of the most distinguished companies of the period were [[John Dibblee Crace|Crace]], Waring &amp; Gillow and Holland &amp; Sons; famous decorators employed by these firms included [[Thomas Edward Collcutt]], [[Edward William Godwin]], [[Charles Barry]], [[Gottfried Semper]], and [[George Edmund Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WcLc-1rLq5oC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Turning Houses Into Homes: A History of the Retailing and Consumption of Domestic Furnishings|author=Clive Edwards|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition to professional interior design===
[[File:Design for a room by John Dibblee Crace.jpg|thumb|300px|This interior was designed by [[John Dibblee Crace]], President of the Institute of British Decorators, established in 1899.]]
By the turn of the 20th century, amateur advisors and publications were increasingly challenging the monopoly that the large retail companies had on interior design. English [[feminism|feminist]] author [[Mary Haweis]] wrote a series of widely read essays in the 1880s in which she derided the eagerness with which aspiring middle-class people furnished their houses according to the rigid models offered to them by the retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LIARJjg8w_gC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Gender and Art|author=Gillian Perry|year=1999|publisher=Yale University Press|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She advocated the individual adoption of a particular style, tailor made to the individual needs and preferences of the customer:
:"One of my strongest convictions, and one of the first canons of good taste, is that our houses, like the fish’s shell and the bird’s nest, ought to represent our individual taste and habits.''

The move towards decoration as a separate artistic profession unrelated to the manufacturers and retailers, received an impetus with the 1899 formation of the Institute of British Decorators; with [[John Dibblee Crace]] as its president it represented almost 200 decorators around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.facultyofdecoration.org/history.htm|title=History|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1915, the London Directory listed 127 individuals trading as interior decorators, of which 10 were women. Rhoda and Agnes Garrett were the first women to train professionally as home decorators in 1874. The importance of their work on design was regarded at the time as on a par with that of [[William Morris]]. In 1876, their work - ''Suggestions for House Decoration in Painting, Woodwork and Furniture'' - spread their ideas on artistic interior design to a wide middle-class audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=53628&amp;back=|title=Garrett sisters|publisher=DNB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900, the situation was described by ''The Illustrated Carpenter and Builder'':
:"Until recently when a man wanted to furnish he would visit all the dealers and select piece by piece of furniture ....Today he sends for a dealer in art furnishings and fittings who surveys all the rooms in the house and he brings his artistic mind to bear on the subject."&lt;ref&gt;The Illustrated Carpenter and Builder, December 7 (1900): Suppl. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, [[Candace Wheeler]] was one of the first woman [[interior designers]] and helped encourage a new style of American design. She was instrumental in the development of art courses for women in a number of major American cities and was considered a national authority on homedesign. An important influence on the new profession was ''[[The Decoration of Houses]]'', a manual of interior design written by [[Edith Wharton]] with architect [[Ogden Codman]] in 1897 in America. In the book, the authors denounced Victorian-style [[interior decoration]] and interior design, especially those rooms that were decorated with heavy window curtains, [[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian bric-a-brac]] and overstuffed furniture. They argued that such rooms emphasized upholstery at the expense of proper space planning and architectural design and were, therefore, uncomfortable and rarely used. The book is considered a seminal work and its success led to the emergence of professional decorators working in the manner advocated by its authors, most notably [[Elsie de Wolfe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/wharton/whar3.htm "Edith Wharton's World"] National Portrait Gallery&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Elsiedewolfe.jpg|thumb|left|[[Elsie de Wolfe]], taken from ''The House in Good Taste'', 1913.]]
[[Elsie De Wolfe]] was one of the first interior designers. Rejecting the Victorian style she grew up with, she chose a more vibrant scheme, along with more comfortable furniture in the home. Her designs were light, with fresh colors and delicate [[Chinoiserie]] furnishings, as opposed to the Victorian preference of heavy, red drapes and upholstery, dark wood and intensely patterned wallpapers. Her designs were also more practical;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Flanner |first=J. |year=2009 |publisher=The New Yorker |title= Archive, Handsprings Across the Sea |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1938/01/15/1938_01_15_025_TNY_CARDS_000170753 }}&lt;/ref&gt; she eliminated the clutter that occupied the Victorian home, enabling people to entertain more guests comfortably. In 1905, de Wolfe was commissioned for the interior design of the [[Colony Club]] on [[Madison Avenue]]; its interiors garnered her recognition almost over night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munhall|first=Edward|title=Elsie de Wolf: The American pioneer who vanquished Victorian gloom|url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/architecture/archive/dewolfe_article_012000|publisher=Architectural Digest|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Christopher (2003), "Streetscapes/Former Colony Club at 120 Madison Avenue; Stanford White Design, Elsie de Wolfe Interior," ''The New York Times'', 28 September 2003 [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5D6143DF93BA1575AC0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;pagewanted=print]&lt;/ref&gt; She compiled her ideas into her widely read 1913 book, ''The House in Good Taste''.&lt;ref name="professionalization1"&gt;Lees-Maffei, G, 2008, Introduction: Professionalization as a focus in Interior Design History, Journal of Design History, Vol. 21, No. 1, Spring.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, [[Syrie Maugham]] became a legendary interior designer credited with designing the first all-white room. Starting her career in the early 1910s, her international reputation soon grew; she later expanded her business to [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Plunket, Robert. "Syrie's Turn: Once, everyone read W. Somerset Maugham. But now his late ex-wife is the one selling books", ''Sarasota Magazine'', 2006, v. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Born during the [[Victorian Era]], a time characterized by dark colors and small spaces, she instead designed rooms filled with light and furnished in multiple shades of white and mirrored screens. In addition to mirrored screens, her trademark pieces included: books covered in white vellum, cutlery with white porcelain handles, console tables with plaster palm-frond, shell, or dolphin bases, upholstered and fringed sleigh beds, fur carpets, dining chairs covered in white leather, and lamps of graduated glass balls, and wreaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k5wYRQAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Pauline+C.+Metcalf%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rtoUUqSIN47Ysgb2_YG4DA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ|title=Syrie Maugham: Staging the Glamorous Interiors|author=Pauline C. Metcalf|year=2010|publisher=Acanthus PressLlc|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
The interior design profession became more established after [[World War II]]. From the 1950s onwards, spending on the home increased. Interior design courses were established, requiring the publication of textbooks and reference sources. Historical accounts of interior designers and firms distinct from the decorative arts specialists were made available. Organisations to regulate education, qualifications, standards and practices, etc. were established for the profession.&lt;ref name="professionalization1"/&gt;

Interior design was previously seen as playing a secondary role to architecture. It also has many connections to other design disciplines, involving the work of [[architects]], [[industrial designers]], [[engineers]], builders, craftsmen, etc. For these reasons, the government of interior design standards and qualifications was often incorporated into other professional organisations that involved design.&lt;ref name="professionalization1"/&gt; Organisations such as the [[Chartered Society of Designers]], established in the UK in 1986, and the American Designers Institute, founded in 1938, governed various areas of design.

It was not until later that specific representation for the interior design profession was developed. The US National Society of Interior Designers was established in 1957, while in the UK the Interior Decorators and Designers Association was established in 1966. Across Europe, other organisations such as The Finnish Association of Interior Architects (1949) were being established and in 1994 the International Interior Design Association was founded.&lt;ref name="professionalization1"/&gt;

Ellen Mazur Thomson, author of ''Origins of Graphic Design in America'' (1997), determined that professional status is achieved through education, self-imposed standards and professional gate-keeping organizations.&lt;ref name="professionalization1"/&gt; Having achieved this, interior design became an accepted profession.

==Interior decorators and interior designers==
[[File:Michelin two-starred Shang Palace main dining hall.jpg|thumb|280px|Interior design in a restaurant]]
Interior design is the art and science of understanding people's behavior to create functional spaces within a building. Decoration is the furnishing or adorning of a space with fashionable or beautiful things. In short, interior designers may decorate, but decorators do not design.

===Interior designer===
Interior designer implies that there is more of an emphasis on planning, [[functional design]] and the effective use of space, as compared to interior decorating. An interior designer in fineline design can undertake projects that include arranging the basic layout of spaces within a building as well as projects that require an understanding of technical issues such as window and door positioning, [[acoustics]], and [[lighting]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; Although an interior designer may create the layout of a space, they may not alter load-bearing walls without having their designs stamped for approval by a structural engineer. Interior designers often work directly with architects, engineers and contractors.

Interior designers must be highly skilled in order to create interior environments that are functional, safe, and adhere to building codes, regulations and ADA requirements. They go beyond the selection of color palettes and furnishings and apply their knowledge to the development of construction documents, occupancy loads, healthcare regulations and sustainable design principles, as well as the management and coordination of professional services including mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and life safety—all to ensure that people can live, learn or work in an innocuous environment that is also aesthetically pleasing.

Someone may wish to specialize and develop technical knowledge specific to one area or type of interior design, such as residential design, commercial design, hospitality design, healthcare design, universal design, exhibition design, furniture design, and spatial branding. 
Interior design is a creative profession that is relatively new, constantly evolving, and often confusing to the public. It is not an artistic pursuit and relies on research from many fields to provide a well-trained understanding of how people are influenced by their environments.

=== Color in interior design ===
Color is a powerful design tool in decoration, as well as in interior design which is the art of composing, and coordinating colors together to create a stylish scheme on the interior architecture of the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interiordezine.com/color/|title=Color Wheel, Color Schemes, Color Therapy, Colors by Interiordezine |website=www.interiordezine.com| access-date = 2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is essential to interior designers to acquire a deep experience with colors, understand their psychological effects, and understand the meaning of each color in different locations and situations in order to create suitable combinations for each place.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://designlike.com/the-psychology-of-color-for-interior-design/|title=The Psychology of Color for Interior Design – Interior Design, Design News and Architecture Trends|website=designlike.com|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combining colors together could result in creating a state of mind as seen by the observer, and could eventually result in positive or negative effects on them. Colors make the room feel either more calm, cheerful, comfortable, stressful, or dramatic. Color combination make a tiny room seem larger or smaller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hgtv.com/remodel/interior-remodel/the-psychology-of-color|title=The Psychology of Color|newspaper=HGTV| access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; So it is the Interior designer profession to choose appropriate colors for a place in a way people want to look and feel in the space.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==Specialties==
[[Image:Electric wire reel reused in a furniture ecodesign.jpg|right|thumb|280px|An electric wire reel reused as a center table in a [[Rio de Janeiro]] decoration [[fair]].]]

===Residential===
Residential design is the design of the interior of private residences. As this type design is very specific for individual situations, the needs and wants of the individual are paramount in this area of interior design. The interior designer may work on the project from the initial planning stage or may work on the remodelling of an existing structure. It is often a very involved process that takes months to fine-tune and create a space with the vision of the client.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;Piotrowski, C, 2004, Becoming an Interior Designer, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New Jersey, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial===
Commercial design encompasses a wide range of subspecialties.
* Retail: includes malls and shopping centers, department stores, specialty stores, visual merchandising, and showrooms.
* Visual and spatial branding: The use of space as a medium to express a corporate brand.
* Corporate: office design for any kind of business such as banks.
* Healthcare: the design of hospitals, assisted living facilities, medical offices, dentist offices, psychiatric facilities, laboratories, medical specialist facilities.
* Hospitality and recreation: includes hotels, motels, resorts, cruise ships, cafes, bars, casinos, nightclubs, theaters, music and concert halls, opera houses, sports venues, restaurants, gyms, health clubs and spas, etc.
* Institutional: government offices, financial institutions (banks and credit unions), schools and universities, religious facilities, etc.
* Industrial facilities: manufacturing and training facilities as well as import and export facilities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;
* Exhibition: includes museums, gallery, exhibition hall, specially the design for showroom and exhibition gallery.
* Traffic building: includes bus station, subway station, airports, pier, etc.
* Sports: includes gyms, stadiums, swimming rooms, basketball halls, etc.
* Teaching in a private institute that offer classes of interior design
* Self-employment
* Employment in private sector firms

===Other===
Other areas of specialization include amusement and theme park design, museum and exhibition design, [[exhibit design]], event design (including ceremonies, weddings, baby and bridal showers, parties, conventions, and concerts), interior and prop styling, craft styling, food styling, product styling, tablescape design, theatre and performance design, stage and set design, [[scenic design]], and [[production designer|production design]] for film and television. Beyond those, interior designers, particularly those with graduate education, can specialize in healthcare design, gerontological design, educational facility design, and other areas that require specialized knowledge. Some university programs offer graduate studies in theses and other areas. For example, both [[Cornell University]] and the [[University of Florida]] offer interior design graduate programs in environment and behavior studies.

===Education===
{{main|Interior design education}}
There are various paths that one can take to become a professional interior designer. All of these paths involve some form of training. Working with a successful professional designer is an informal method of training and has previously been the most common method of education. In many states, however, this path alone cannot lead to licensing as a professional interior designer. Training through an institution such as a college, art or design school or university is a more formal route to professional practice.

In the UK and the U.S, several university degree courses are now available, including those on interior architecture, taking three or four years to complete.

A formal education program, particularly one accredited by or developed with a professional organization of interior designers, can provide training that meets a minimum standard of excellence and therefore gives a student an education of a high standard. There are also university graduate and Ph.d. programs available for those seeking further training in a specific design specialization (i.e. gerontological or healthcare design) or those wishing to teach interior design at the university level.

===Working conditions===
There are a wide range of working conditions and employment opportunities within interior design. Large and tiny corporations often hire interior designers as employees on regular working hours. Designers for smaller firms and [[online renovation platforms]] usually work on a contract or per-job basis. Self-employed designers, which make up 26% of interior designers,&lt;ref&gt;"Employment." Occupational Outlook Handbook: 2008-09 Edition, [http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos293.htm#empty US Department of Labor]&lt;/ref&gt; usually work the most hours. Interior designers often work under stress to meet deadlines, stay on budget, and meet clients' needs.

In some cases, licensed professionals review the work and sign it before submitting the design for approval by clients or construction permisioning. The need for licensed review and signature varies by locality, relevant legislation, and scope of work. Their work can involve significant travel to visit different locations. However, with technology development, the process of contacting clients and communicating design alternatives has become easier and requires less travel.&lt;ref name="IBIS World"&gt;{{cite web |title=Industrial Design Industry Report |url=http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/retail.aspx?indid=1410&amp;chid=1 |publisher=ibisworld.com |date= July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They also renovate a space to satisfy the specific taste for a client.

==Styles==

===Art Deco===
[[File:Eastern Columbia Building entrance.jpg|thumb | upright | right | [[Terracotta]] [[Art Deco]] [[Sunburst|sunburst design]] above front doors of the [[Eastern Columbia Building]] in Los Angeles; built 1930.]]
The [[Art Deco]] style began in Europe in the early years of the 20th century, with the waning of [[Art Nouveau]]. The term "Art Deco" was taken from the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes, a world’s fair held in Paris in 1925.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;Tinniswood, Adrian. The Art Deco House: Avant-Garde House of the 1920s and 1930s. Watsonguptill publishing company. New York. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Art Deco rejected many traditional classical influences in favour of more streamlined geometric forms and metallic color. The Art Deco style influenced all areas of design, especially interior design, because it was the first style of interior decoration to spotlight new technologies and materials.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1990"&gt;Striner, Richard. "Art Deco: Polemics and Synthesis". WInterthur portfolio, Vol 25. No. 1 spring, 1990. PP. 26-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Deco style is mainly based on geometric shapes, streamlining, and clean lines.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"&gt;Beusterien, John. Rodriguez, EduardoLuis. Narciso G. The Architectural Avant-Garde: From Art Deco to Modern Regionalism. The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts, Vol. 22, Cuba Theme Issue (1996), PP. 254-277&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Stanley, Meisler. ’Art Deco: High Style. Smithsonian’, Nov 2004, Vol. 35 Issue 8, PP 57-60&lt;/ref&gt; The style offered a sharp, cool look of mechanized living utterly at odds with anything that came before.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Bayer, Patricia, Art Deco Interiors: Decoration and Design Classics of the 1920s and 1930s, Thames &amp; Hudson, London 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Deco rejected traditional materials of decoration and interior design, opting instead to use more unusual materials such as [[chrome plating|chrome]], [[glass]], [[stainless steel]], shiny fabrics, [[mirror]]s, [[aluminium]], [[lacquer]], [[inlay|inlaid wood]], [[sharkskin]], and zebra skin.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1990"/&gt; The use of harder, metallic materials was chosen to celebrate the machine age. These materials reflected the dawning modern age that was ushered in after the end of the [[First World War]]. The innovative combinations of these materials created contrasts that were very popular at the time - for example the mixing together of highly polished wood and black lacquer with satin and furs.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Jian. "Art Deco 1910-39". Craft Arts International, 2003, Issue 59, PP. 84-87.&lt;/ref&gt; The barber shop in the Austin Reed store in London was designed by P. J. Westwood. It was soon regarded as the trendiest barber shop in Britain due to its use of metallic materials.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

The color themes of Art Deco consisted of metallic color, neutral color, bright color, and black and white. In interior design, cool metallic colors including silver, gold, metallic blue, charcoal grey, and platinum tended to predominate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tinniswood, Adrian. ‘The Art Deco House: Avant-Garde House of the 1920s and 1930s’. Watsonguptill publishing company. New York. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Serge Chermayeff]], a Russian-born British designer made extensive use of cool metallic colors and luxurious surfaces in his room schemes. His 1930 showroom design for a British dressmaking firm had a silver-grey background and black mirrored-glass wall panels.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Striner, Richard. ‘Art Deco: Polemics and Synthesis’. WInterthur portfolio, Vol 25. No. 1 ( spring, 1990). PP. 26-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black and white was also a very popular color scheme during the 1920s and 1930s. Black and white checkerboard tiles, floors and wallpapers were very trendy at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Jian. ‘Art Deco 1910-39’. Craft Arts International, 2003, Issue 59, PP. 84-87.&lt;/ref&gt; As the style developed, bright vibrant colors became popular as well.&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, David. ‘Art Deco Renaissance’. Silvester-Carr, Denise. History Today, Jul, Vol. 49. Issue 7. PP.4-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Deco furnishings and lighting fixtures had a glossy, luxurious appearance with the use of inlaid wood and reflective finishes. The furniture pieces often had curved edges, geometric shapes, and clean lines.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; Art Deco lighting fixtures tended to make use of stacked geometric patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Alastair. "Art Deco Lighting". The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts. Vol. 1 (spring. 1986). PP. 20-31&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern Art ===
"Modern design grew out of the decorative arts, mostly from the [[Art Deco]], in the early 20th century."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Modern Interior Design|url = http://homeguides.sfgate.com/modern-interior-design-8659.html#|website = Home Guides {{!}} SF Gate|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first to introduce this style was [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], who hadn't become hugely popularized until completing the house called [[Fallingwater]] in the 1930s. "Modern art reached its peak in the 1950s and 60s which is why designers and decorators today may refer to modern design as being "mid-century."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Modern Art does not refer to the era or age of design. "Modern art is not the same as contemporary design, which is a term that interior designers apply to a shifting group of recent styles and trends."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Arab Materials===
“[[Majlis]] painting”, also called [[nagash painting]], is the decoration of the [[majlis]] or front parlor of traditional Arabic homes in the [[Asir]] province of [[Saudi Arabia]] and adjoining parts of [[Yemen]] These wall paintings, an [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] form of [[mural]] or [[fresco]], show various geometric designs in bright colors: “Called 'nagash' in Arabic, the wall paintings were a mark of pride for a woman in her house.”&lt;ref name="Yunis, Alia, The Majlis Painters,"&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201304/the.majlis.painters.htm Yunis, Alia, "The Majlis Painters,"] Saudi Aramco World Magazine, July/August 2013, pages 24-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The geometric designs and heavy lines seem to be adapted from the area’s textile and weaving patterns. “In contrast with the sobriety of architecture and decoration in the rest of Arabia, exuberant color and ornamentation characterize those of 'Asir. The painting extends into the house over the walls and doors, up the staircases, and onto the furniture itself. When a house is being painted, women from the community help each other finish the job. The building then displays their shared taste and knowledge. Mothers pass these on to their daughters. This artwork is based on a [[geometry]] of straight lines and suggests the patterns common to textile [[weaving]], with solid bands of different colors. Certain motifs reappear, such as the triangular [[mihrab]] or 'niche' and the [[palmette]]. In the past, paint was produced from mineral and vegetable [[pigment]]s. [[Clove]]s and [[alfalfa]] yielded green. Blue came from the [[indigo]] plant. Red came from [[pomegranate]]s and a certain mud. [[Paintbrush]]es were created from the tough hair found in a goat's tail. Today, however, women use modern manufactured paint to create new looks, which have become an indicator of social and economic change.”&lt;ref&gt;Maha Al Faisal and Khalid Azzam. 1999. "Doors of the Kingdom" Saudi Aramco World. This article appeared on pages 68-77 of the January/February 1999 print edition of Saudi Aramco World# http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199901/doors.of.the.kingdom.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in the Asir province often complete the decoration and painting of the house interior. “You could tell a family’s wealth by the paintings,” [[Um Abdullah]] says: “If they didn’t have much money, the wife could only paint the [[motholath]],” the basic straight, simple lines, in patterns of three to six repetitions in red, green, yellow and brown.” When women did not want to paint the walls themselves, they could [[barter]] with other women who would do the work. Several Saudi women have become famous as majlis painters, such as [[Fatima Abou Gahas]].&lt;ref name="Yunis, Alia, The Majlis Painters,"/&gt;

The interior walls of the home are brightly painted by the women, who work in defined patterns with lines, triangles, squares, diagonals and tree-like patterns. “Some of the large triangles represent mountains. Zigzag lines stand for water and also for lightning. Small triangles, especially when the widest area is at the top, are found in pre-Islamic representations of female figures. That the small triangles found in the wall paintings in ‘Asir are called banat may be a cultural remnant of a long-forgotten past.”&lt;ref name="Yunis, Alia, The Majlis Painters,"/&gt;

"[[Courtyard]]s and upper pillared [[porticoes]] are principal features of the best Nadjdi architecture, in addition to the fine incised plaster wood ([[jiss]]) and painted window shutters, which decorate the reception rooms. Good examples of plasterwork can often be seen in the gaping ruins of torn-down buildings- the effect is light, delicate and airy. It is usually around the [[majlis]], around the coffee hearth and along the walls above where guests sat on rugs, against cushions. Doughty wondered if this "[[parquet]]ting of jis", this "[[gypsum]] fretwork... all adorning and unenclosed" originated from [[India]]. However, the Najd fretwork seems very different from that seen in the Eastern Province and [[Oman]], which are linked to Indian traditions, and rather resembles the [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s and patterns found in ancient [[Mesopotamia]]. The rosette, the star, the triangle and the stepped pinnacle pattern of dadoes are all ancient patterns, and can be found all over the [[Middle East]] of antiquity. [[Al-Qassim Province]] seems to be the home of this art, and there it is normally worked in hard white [[plaster]] (though what you see is usually begrimed by the smoke of the coffee hearth). In [[Riyadh]], examples can be seen in unadorned [[clay]].&lt;ref&gt;Mostyn, Trevor. 1983. Saudi Arabia. London: Middle East Economic Digest. Pages 257-258.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media popularization==
{{main|Interior design magazine}}
Interior design has become the subject of [[television]] shows. In the [[United Kingdom]] (UK), popular interior design and decorating programs include ''[[60 Minute Makeover]]'' ([[ITV Network|ITV]]), ''[[Changing Rooms]]'' ([[BBC]]), and ''Selling Houses'' ([[Channel 4]]). Famous interior designers whose work is featured in these programs include [[Linda Barker]] and [[Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen]]. In the [[United States]], the [[TLC Network]] aired a popular program called ''[[Trading Spaces]]'', a show based on the UK program ''Changing Rooms''. In addition, both [[HGTV]] and the [[DIY Network]] also televise many programs about interior design and decorating, featuring the works of a variety of interior designers, decorators, and home improvement experts in a myriad of projects.

Fictional interior decorators include the Sugarbaker sisters on ''[[Designing Women]]'' and [[Grace Adler]] on ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]''. There is also another show called ''Home MADE''. There are two teams and two houses and whoever has the designed and made the worst room, according to the judges, is eliminated. Another show on the [[Style Network]], hosted by [[Niecy Nash]], is ''[[Clean House]]'' where they re-do messy homes into themed rooms that the clients would like. Other shows include ''[[Design on a Dime]]'', ''[[Designed to Sell]]'', and ''[[The Decorating Adventures of Ambrose Price]]''. The show called ''[[HGTV Design Star|Design Star]]'' has become more popular through the 5 seasons that have already aired. The winners of this show end up getting their own TV shows, of which are ''[[Color Splash]]'' hosted by [[David Bromstad]], ''Myles of Style'' hosted by [[Kim Myles]], ''Paint-Over!'' hosted by [[Jennifer Bertrand]], ''[[The Antonio Treatment]]'' hosted by Antonio Ballatore, and finally ''Secrets from a Stylist'' hosted by [[Emily Henderson]]. [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]] also has a variety of shows that explore the lives of interior designers. These include ''[[Flipping Out]]'', which explores the life of [[Jeff Lewis (real estate speculator)|Jeff Lewis]] and his team of designers; ''[[Million Dollar Decorators]]'' explores the lives of interior designers [[Nathan Turner]], Jeffrey Alan Marks, Mary McDonald, Kathryn Ireland, and [[Martyn Lawrence Bullard]].

Interior design has also become the subject of [[radio]] shows. In the U.S., popular interior design &amp; lifestyle shows include ''[[Martha Stewart Living]]'' and ''Living Large'' featuring Karen Mills. Famous interior designers whose work is featured on these programs include Bunny Williams, [[Barbara Barry]], and [[Kathy Ireland]], among others.

Many interior design magazines exist to offer advice regarding color palette, furniture, art, and other elements that fall under the umbrella of interior design. These magazine often focus on related subjects to draw a more specific audience. For instance, architecture as a primary aspect of ''[[Dwell (magazine)|Dwell]]'', while ''[[Veranda (magazine)|Veranda]]'' is well known as a luxury living magazine. ''[[Lonny (magazine)|Lonny Magazine]]'' and the newly relaunched, ''[[Domino (magazine)|Domino Magazine]]'', cater to a young, hip, metropolitan audience, and emphasize accessibility and a do-it-yourself ([[DIY]]) approach to interior design.

{{styles}}
A '''style guide''' or '''style manual''' is a set of standards for the writing and design of documents, either for general use or for a specific publication, organization or field. The implementation of a style guide provides uniformity in style and formatting within a document and across multiple documents. A set of standards for a specific organization is often known as "house style". Style guides are common for general and specialized use, for the general reading and writing audience, and for students and scholars of various [[academia|academic]] disciplines, medicine, journalism, the law, government, business, and industry.

==International==
Several basic style guides for technical and scientific communication have been defined by international [[standards organization]]s. These are often used as elements of and refined in more specialized style guides that are specific to a subject, region or organization. Some examples are:

'''Material handling''' involves short-distance movement within the confines of a building or between a building and a transportation vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Management of Business Logistics|last = Coyle|first = J.J.|publisher = South-Western|year = 1992|location = Mason, OH|pages = 308}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a wide range of manual, semi-automated, and automated equipment and includes consideration of the protection, storage, and control of materials throughout their manufacturing, warehousing, distribution, consumption, and disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mhi.org/fundamentals/material-handling|title = Material handling |accessdate = 2014-10-02|publisher = MHI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Material handling can be used to create ''time and place utility'' through the handling, storage, and control of material, as distinct from manufacturing, which creates ''form utility'' by changing the shape, form, and makeup of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Material Handling System Design|last = Apple|first = J.M.|publisher = Ronald|year = 1972|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of material handling ==
Material handling plays an important role in manufacturing and logistics, which together represent over 20% of the U.S. economy.&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturing
12.0% in 2014 ({{Cite web|url = http://www.nam.org/Newsroom/Facts-About-Manufacturing/|title = Facts About Manufacturing|date = |accessdate = 2015-05-05 |publisher = Nat. Assoc. of Mfg. }}) and logistics
8.2% in 2013 ({{Cite web|url = http://info.tranzact.com/hs-fs/hub/329734/file-2168640880-pdf/2mw-email/25th_Annual_SOL_Report_Update_11_10_14.pdf|title = Annual State of Logistics Report State of Logistics Report|date = Nov 2014|accessdate = 2015-02-15|publisher = CSCMP}})&lt;/ref&gt; Almost every item of physical commerce was transported on a conveyor or lift truck or other type of [[material handling equipment]] in manufacturing plants, warehouses, and retail stores.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mhlroadmap.org/downloads/mhl_roadmap.pdf|title = Material Handling and Logistics U.S. Roadmap|date = January 2014|accessdate = 2015-05-08|publisher = MHI}}&lt;/ref&gt; While material handling is usually required as part of every production worker's job, over 650,000 people in the U.S. work as dedicated "material moving machine operators" and have a median annual wage of $31,530 (May 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bls.gov/ooh/transportation-and-material-moving/material-moving-machine-operators.htm|title = Occupational Outlook Handbook|date = |accessdate = 2015-05-14|publisher = BLS}}&lt;/ref&gt; These operators use material handling equipment to transport various goods in a variety of industrial settings including moving construction materials around building sites or moving goods onto ships.

== Design of material handling systems ==
[[File:TG-usine-après.JPG|thumb|Material flow diagram between activities in a layout]]

Material handling is integral to the design of most production systems since the efficient flow of material between the activities of a production system is heavily dependent on the arrangement (or ''layout'') of the activities. If two activities are adjacent to each other, then material might easily be handed from one activity to another. If activities are in sequence, a conveyor can move the material at low cost. If activities are separated, more expensive industrial trucks or overhead conveyors are required for transport. The high cost of using an industrial truck for material transport is due to both the labor costs of the operator and the negative impact on the performance of a production system (e.g., increased [[work in process]]) when multiple units of material are combined into a single transfer batch in order to reduce the number of trips required for transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Factory Physics|last = Hopp|first = W.J.|publisher = Waveland|year = 2011|location = Long Grove, IL|pages = 318–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The unit load concept ===
[[File:Unit Load Size.png|thumb|Production batch can be split into a smaller transfer batch containing several unit loads, each of which can contain multiple parts]]

A unit load is either a single unit of an item, or multiple units so arranged or restricted that they can be handled as a single unit and maintain their integrity. Although granular, liquid, and gaseous materials can be transported in bulk, they can also be contained into unit loads using bags, drums, and cylinders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Basics of Material Handling|last = Kulwiec|first = R.A.|publisher = MHI|year = 1981|location = Charlotte, NC|pages = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advantages of unit loads are that more items can be handled at the same time (thereby reducing the number of trips required, and potentially reducing handling costs, loading and unloading times, and product damage) and that it enables the use of standardized material handling equipment. Disadvantages of unit loads include the negative impact of batching on production system performance, and the cost of returning empty containers/pallets to their point of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Manufacturing Facilities: Location, Planning, and Design|last = Sule|first = D.R.|publisher = PWS|year = 1994|location = Boston|pages = 249}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pallet wrapper.jpg|thumb|Stretch-wrapping machine used to form a unit load]]

=== In-process handling ===
Unit loads can be used both for in-process handling and for distribution (receiving, storing, and shipping). Unit load design involves determining the type, size, weight, and configuration of the load; the equipment and method used to handle the load; and the methods of forming (or building) and breaking down the load. For in-process handling, unit loads should not be larger than the [[batch production|production batch]] size of parts in process. Large production batches (used to increase the utilization of bottleneck activities) can be split into smaller ''transfer batches'' for handling purposes, where each transfer batch contains one or more unit loads, and small unit loads can be combined into a larger transfer batch to allow more efficient transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modeling and Analysis of Manufacturing Systems|last = Askin|first = R.G.|publisher = Wiley|year = 1993|location = New York|pages = 292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distribution ===
[[File:ALMACEN CAYCO carpetilla.jpg|thumb|Narrow-aisle lift truck used in distribution]]
Selecting a unit load size for distribution can be difficult because containers/pallets are usually available only in standard sizes and configurations; truck trailers, rail boxcars, and airplane cargo bays are limited in width, length, and height; and the number of feasible container/pallet sizes for a load may be limited due to the existing warehouse layout and storage rack configurations and customer package/carton size and retail store shelf restrictions. Also, the practical size of a unit load may be limited by the equipment and aisle space available and the need for safe material handling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ise.ncsu.edu/kay/Material_Handling_Equipment.pdf|title = Material Handling Equipment|date = 2012|accessdate = 2014-10-02|publisher = |last = Kay|first = M.G.|pages = 5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of material handling ==

=== Manual handling ===
[[File:Niosh-lifting-equation-illustration.gif|thumb|NIOSH Lifting Equation applied to loading punch press stock task]]

Manual handling refers to the use of a worker’s hands to move individual containers by lifting, lowering, filling, emptying, or carrying them. It can expose workers to physical conditions that can lead to injuries that represent a large percentage of the over half a million cases of musculoskeletal disorders reported in the U.S. each year, and often involve strains and sprains to the lower back, shoulders, and upper limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2007-131/pdfs/2007-131.pdf|title = Ergonomic Guidelines for Manual Material Handling|date = 2007|accessdate = 2015-05-15|publisher = California Department of Industrial Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ergonomic improvements can be used to modify manual handling tasks to reduce injury. These improvements can include reconfiguring the task and using positioning equipment like lift/tilt/turn tables, hoists, balancers, and manipulators to reduce reaching and bending. The NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) 1991 Revised Lifting Equation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Applications Manual for the Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation|last = Waters|first = T.R.|publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|year = 1994|location = Cincinnati, OH|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to evaluate manual lifting tasks. Under ideal circumstances, the maximum recommended weight for manual lifting to avoid back injuries is 51&amp;nbsp;lb (23.13&amp;nbsp;kg). Using the exact conditions of the lift (height, distance lifted, weight, position of weight relative to body, asymmetrical lifts, and objects that are difficult to grasp), six multipliers are used to reduce the maximum recommended weight for less than ideal lifting tasks.

=== Automated handling ===
[[File:FANUC R2000iB AtWork.jpg|thumb|Industrial robot]]
Whenever technically and economically feasible, equipment can be used to reduce and sometimes replace the need to manually handle material. Most existing material handling equipment is only ''semi-automated'' because a human operator is needed for tasks like loading/unloading and driving that are difficult and/or too costly to fully automate. However, ongoing advances in sensing, machine intelligence, and robotics have made it possible to fully automate an increasing number of handling tasks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=dexarticle&gt;{{cite web |last1=Knight |first1=Will |title=This is the most dexterous robot ever created |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610587/robots-get-closer-to-human-like-dexterity/ |website=MIT Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hodson |first1=Richard |title=How robots are grasping the art of gripping |journal=Nature |date=10 May 2018 |volume=557 |issue=7704 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05093-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dexnet&gt;[https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/dex-net/ Mahler, Jeffrey, et al. "Dexterity Network Home Page"]&lt;/ref&gt; A rough guide to determine how much can be spent for automated equipment that would replace one material handler is to consider that, with benefits, the median moving machine operator costs a company $45,432 per year.&lt;ref&gt;$31,530 median wage divided by 0.694, where wages represent 69.4% and benefits 30.6% of total labor cost ({{Cite web|url = http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ecec.nr0.htm|title = Employer Costs for Employee Compensation|date = December 2014|accessdate = 2015-05-15|publisher = BLS}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming a real interest rate of 1.7%&lt;ref&gt;Average U.S. rate from 2005-2009 ({{Cite web|url = http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FR.INR.RINR|title = Real interest rate|date = |accessdate = 2015-05-15|publisher = The World Bank}}).&lt;/ref&gt; and a service life of 5 years&lt;ref&gt;Average service life of Custom Software ({{Cite web|url = https://www.bea.gov/national/FA2004/Tablecandtext.pdf|title = BEA Depreciation Estimates|date = 2004|accessdate = 2015-05-15|publisher = BEA}}), conservative assumption since software is a major component of automated equipment and has the shortest service life compared to other components.&lt;/ref&gt; for the equipment with no salvage value,&lt;ref&gt;Conservative assumption that simplifies the analysis since any positive salvage value would
increase the purchase cost estimate.&lt;/ref&gt; a company should be willing to pay up to

&lt;math&gt;\$45\,432\left (\frac{1-1.017^{-5}}{0.017} \right )=\$45\,432(4.75)=\$219\,019
&lt;/math&gt;

to purchase automated equipment to replace one worker.&lt;ref&gt;Amount willing to pay is the present value of an [[Present value|annuity immediate]].&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, automated equipment is not as flexible as a human operator, both with respect to not being able to do a particular task as well as a human and not being able to be as easily redeployed to do other tasks as needs change.

==History==

In January 2000 Ama Ata Aidoo started an initiative called '''Mbaasem''' (meaning "women’s words, women’s affairs" in [[Akan language|Akan]])&lt;ref name=CWG /&gt; based in Accra, Ghana, with the goal of building a women writers' centre and residency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wworld.org/archive/annual_report2000.htm Annual Report 1999-2000], Women's WORLD.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently incorporated as a registered non-governmental organization, the Mbaasem Foundation reflects the mission of its founder "to develop and support the sustainability of the work of African women writers who are usually sidelined in the industry".&lt;ref&gt;Kundai Mugwanda-Nyamutenha,
 [https://thisisafrica.me/lifestyle/womens-history-month-profile-ama-ata-aidoo/ "Women’s History Month profile: Ama Ata Aidoo"], ''This Is Africa'', 30 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012 Mbaasem launched a three-year project to develop a literacy manifesto to improve the literacy rate within Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;Marian Ansah, [http://efeansah1990.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/mbaasem-foundation-launches-manifesto.html "Mbaasem Foundation Launches manifesto To Bridge Literacy Gap"], 8 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Other activities include organizing the "Mbaasem Writing Contest for Girls", funded by the US Embassy of Ghana and [[The Royal Bank]] Ltd, with GHC 1000 as the top prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gowomanafrica.com/mbaasem-writing-contest-for-girls-deadline-january-31st-2015/ "Mbaasem Writing Contest for Girls"], ''GoWoman'',

The Mbaasem Foundation has also been involved in international conferences for women writers. In 2013, it collaborated with the [[Organization of Women Writers of Africa]] (OWWA), [[New York University]] (NYU), and the [[Spanish Fundación Mujeres por África]] (Women for Africa Foundation) to present a major conference in Accra, ''Yari Yari Ntoaso: Continuing the Dialogue – An International Conference on Literature by Women of African Ancestry'', held from 16 to 19 May.&lt;ref name=CWG&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativewritingghana.wordpress.com/tag/mbaasem/|title=Yari Yari Ntoaso: An International Conference in Ghana on Literature by Women of African Ancestry|publisher=Creative Writing Ghana|date=20 April 2013|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghanaian writers and scholars including Ama Ata Aidoo, [[Amma Darko]], [[Ruby Goka]], [[Mamle Kabu]], [[Esi Sutherland-Addy]] and [[Margaret Busby]] were invited to speak at the event, and among notable participants from other parts of the world who attended were [[Angela Davis]] of the USA, [[Tess Onwueme]] of Nigeria, [[Natalia Molebatsi]] of South Africa, [[Yolanda Arroyo Pizarro]] of Puerto Rico, [[Véronique Tadjo]] of Côte d'Ivoire, and [[Évelyne Trouillot]] of Haiti.&lt;ref name=CWG /&gt;

'''Morphology''' is a branch of [[biology]] dealing with the study of the form and structure of organisms and their specific structural features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/morphology|title=Morphology|last=|first=|date=|website=Oxford Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This includes aspects of the outward appearance ([[shape]], [[structure]], [[colour]], [[pattern]], [[size]]), i.e. '''external morphology''' (or [[eidonomy]]), as well as the form and structure of the internal parts like [[bones]] and [[organs]], i.e. '''internal morphology''' (or [[anatomy]]). This is in contrast to [[physiology]], which deals primarily with function. Morphology is a branch of [[List of life sciences|life science]] dealing with the study of gross structure of an [[organism]] or [[taxon]] and its component parts.

== History ==
The word "morphology" is from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''μορφή'', ''morphé'', meaning "form", and ''λόγος'', ''lógos'', meaning "word, study, research".

While the concept of form in biology, opposed to [[Function (biology)|function]], dates back to Aristotle (see [[Aristotle's biology]]), the field of morphology was developed by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1790) and independently by the German anatomist and physiologist [[Karl Friedrich Burdach]] (1800).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Karl|last= Mägdefrau|year= 1992|title= Geschichte der Botanik [History of Botany]|edition= 2|publisher= Gustav Fischer Verlag|location= Jena|isbn= 3-437-20489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other important theorists of morphology are [[Lorenz Oken]], [[Georges Cuvier]], [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], [[Richard Owen]], [[Karl Gegenbaur]] and [[Ernst Haeckel]].&lt;ref&gt;Richards, R. J. (2008). A Brief History of Morphology. In: ''The Tragic Sense of Life. Ernst Haeckel and the Struggle over Evolutionary Thought''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Di Gregorio, M. A. (2005). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aZK004HREqgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=morphology&amp;f=false From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith].'' Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830, Cuvier and E.G.Saint-Hilaire engaged in [[Cuvier–Geoffroy debate|a famous debate]], which is said to exemplify the two major deviations in biological thinking at the time – whether animal structure was due to function or evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Appel, Toby (1987). ''The Cuvier-Geoffroy Debate: French Biology in the Decades Before Darwin''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Divisions of morphology ==
* [[Comparative anatomy|Comparative morphology]] is analysis of the patterns of the locus of structures within the body plan of an organism, and forms the basis of taxonomical categorization.
* [[Functional morphology]] is the study of the relationship between the structure and function of morphological features.
* Experimental morphology is the study of the effects of external factors upon the morphology of organisms under experimental conditions, such as the effect of genetic mutation.
* "[[Anatomy]]" is a "branch of morphology that deals with the structure of [[organisms]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anatomy|title=Anatomy – Definition of anatomy by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Molecular Morphology is a term used in [[English-speaking countries]] for describing the structure of compound [[molecules]], such as [[polymers]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eng.uc.edu/~gbeaucag/Classes/Morphology.html|accessdate=2010-06-24|publisher=ceas.uc.edu/|title= Polymer Morphology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ribonucleic acid ([[RNA]]).
* Gross Morphology refers to the collective structures of an organism as a whole as a general description of the form and structure of an organism, taking into account all of its structures without specifying an individual structure.

== Morphology and classification ==
Most taxa differ morphologically from other taxa. Typically, closely related taxa differ much less than more distantly related ones, but there are exceptions to this. [[Cryptic species]] are [[species]] which look very similar, or perhaps even outwardly identical, but are reproductively isolated. Conversely, sometimes unrelated taxa acquire a similar appearance as a result of [[convergent evolution]] or even [[mimicry]]. In addition, there can be morphological differences within a species, such as in ''[[Apoica flavissima]]'' where queens are significantly smaller than workers. A further problem with relying on morphological data is that what may appear, morphologically speaking, to be two distinct species, may in fact be shown by [[DNA analysis]] to be a single species. The significance of these differences can be examined through the use of [[allometric engineering]] in which one or both species are manipulated to phenocopy the other species.

A step relevant to the evaluation of morphology between traits/features within species, includes an assessment of the terms: [[Homology (biology)|homology]] and [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/a-z/Homoplasies.asp homoplasy]. Homology between features indicate that those features have been derived from a common ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36011744|title=A dictionary of ecology, evolution, and systematics|last=J.|first=Lincoln, Roger|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Boxshall, Geoffrey Allan., Clark, P. F.|isbn=052143842X|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge|oclc=36011744}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, homoplasy between features describes those that can resemble each other, but derive independently via [[Parallel evolution|parallel]] or [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/184829042|title=Vertebrate life|last=Harvey.|first=Pough, F.|date=2009|publisher=Benjamin Cummings|others=Janis, Christine M. (Christine Marie), 1950-, Heiser, John B.|isbn=0321545761|edition=8th|location=San Francisco|oclc=184829042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==3D cell morphology: classification==
Invention and development of microscopy enable the observation of 3-D cell morphology with both high spatial and temporal resolution. The dynamic processes of these cell morphology which are controlled by a [[complex system]] play an important role in varied important biological process, such as immune and invasive responses.&lt;ref&gt;A.

'''Neo-expressionism''' is a style of [[Late Modernism|late modernist]] or early-[[Postmodern art|postmodern]] painting and sculpture that emerged in the late 1970s. Neo-expressionists were sometimes called ''[[Transavantgarde]]'', ''[[Junge Wilde]]'' or ''Neue Wilden'' ('The new wild ones'; 'New Fauves' would better meet the meaning of the term). It is characterized by intense subjectivity and rough handling of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian and John Glaves-Smith. ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press (2009), p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-expressionism developed as a reaction against [[conceptual art]] and [[minimal art]] of the 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in an [[abstract art|abstract]] manner), in a rough and violently emotional way, often using vivid colors. It was overtly inspired by [[German Expressionist]] painters, such as [[Emil Nolde]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[George Grosz]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[James Ensor]] and [[Edvard Munch]]. It is also related to American [[Lyrical Abstraction]] painting of the 1960s and 1970s, [[The Hairy Who]] movement in Chicago, the [[Bay Area Figurative School]] of the 1950s and 1960s, the continuation of [[Abstract Expressionism]], New Image Painting and precedents in [[Pop art|Pop Painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian and John Glaves-Smith. ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press (2009), p. 503-504&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

Neo-expressionism dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. The style emerged internationally and was viewed by many  critics, such as [[Achille Bonito Oliva]] and [[Donald Kuspit]], as a revival of traditional themes of self-expression in European art after decades of American dominance. The social and economic value of the movement was hotly debated.

Critics such as [[Benjamin Buchloh]], [[Hal Foster (art critic)|Hal Foster]], [[Craig Owens (critic)|Craig Owens]], and [[Mira Schor]] were highly critical of its relation to the marketability of painting on the rapidly expanding art market, celebrity, the [[anti-feminism|backlash against feminism]], [[anti-intellectualism]], and a return to mythic subjects and individualist methods they deemed outmoded. Women were notoriously marginalized in the movement, and painters such as [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]] and [[Maria Lassnig]] were omitted from many of its key exhibitions, most notoriously the 1981 "New Spirit in Painting" exhibition in London which included 38 male painters but no female painters.

{{Sexual orientation}}
[[Sexual orientation]] is an enduring pattern of [[Romance (love)|romantic]] or [[Sexual attraction|sexual]] attraction (or a combination of these) to persons of the opposite [[sex]] or [[gender]],&lt;!-- NOTE: "Sex" and "gender" are not always the same thing; for example, "sex" may refer to "biological sex" (being male or female), while "gender" may refer to a person's gender identity of being a man or a woman; therefore, like the Heterosexuality, Homosexuality and Bisexuality articles, we have included both in the lead. --&gt; the same sex or gender, or to both sexes or more than one gender.&lt;ref name="AmPsycholAssn-whatis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual orientation, homosexuality and bisexuality|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|accessdate=August 10, 2013|url=http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx|archivedate=August 8, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808032050/http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AmPsychiAssn-Sexual orientation"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sexual Orientation|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|accessdate=January 1, 2013|url=http://healthyminds.org/More-Info-For/GayLesbianBisexuals.aspx|archivedate=July 22, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722080052/http://www.healthyminds.org/More-Info-For/GayLesbianBisexuals.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate causes and mechanisms of sexual orientation development in humans remain unclear and many theories are speculative and controversial. However, advances in [[neuroscience]] explain and illustrate characteristics linked to sexual orientation. Studies have explored structural neural-correlates, functional and/or cognitive relationships, and developmental theories relating to sexual orientation in humans.

== Developmental neurobiology ==
Many theories concerning the development of sexual orientation involve fetal neural development, with proposed models illustrating prenatal hormone exposure, maternal immunity, and developmental instability. Other proposed factors include genetic control of sexual orientation. No conclusive evidence has been shown that environmental or learned effects are responsible for the development of non-heterosexual orientation.&lt;ref name="number6"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2005.03.002 |title=The neurodevelopment of human sexual orientation |year=2005 |last1=Rahman |first1=Q |journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews |volume=29 |pages=1057–66 |pmid=16143171 |issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2005, [[sexual dimorphisms]] in the brain and behavior among vertebrates were accounted for by the influence of gonadal steroidal [[androgens]] as demonstrated in animal models over the prior few few decades. The prenatal androgen model of homosexuality describes the neuro-developmental effects of fetal exposure to these hormones.&lt;ref name=number6 /&gt; In 1985, Geschwind and Galaburda proposed that homosexual men are exposed to high androgen levels early in development and proposed that temporal and local variations in androgen exposure to a fetus's developing brain is a factor in the pathways determining homosexuality.&lt;ref name=number6 /&gt;  This led scientists to look for somatic markers for prenatal hormonal exposure that could be easily, and non-invasively, explored in otherwise endocrinologically normal populations. Various somatic markers (including [[Digit ratio|2D:4D finger ratios]], [[Evoked potential#Auditory evoked potential|auditory evoked potentials]], fingerprint patterns and eye-blink patterns) have since been found to show variation based on sexual orientation in healthy adult individuals.&lt;ref name="number6"/&gt;

Other evidence supporting the role of [[testosterone]] and prenatal hormones in sexual orientation development include observations of male subjects with [[cloacal exstrophy]] who were sex-assigned as female during birth only later to declare themselves male. This supports the theory that the prenatal testosterone surge is crucial for gender identity development. Additionally, females whose mothers were exposed to [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES) during pregnancy show higher rates of bi- and homosexuality.&lt;ref name="number11"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Swaab DF |title=Sexual differentiation of the human brain: relevance for gender identity, transsexualism and sexual orientation |journal=Gynecological Endocrinology |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=301–12 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15724806 |doi=10.1080/09513590400018231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research directions ==
As of 2005, research directions included:&lt;ref name=number6 /&gt; 
* finding markers for sex steroid levels in the brains of fetuses that highlight features of early neuro-development leading to certain sexual orientations
* determine the precise neural circuitry underlying direction of sexual preference
* use animal models to explore genetic and developmental factors that influence sexual orientation
* further population studies, genetic studies, and serological markers to clarify and definitively determine the effect of maternal immunity
* neuroimaging studies to quantify sexual-orientation-related differences in structure and function in vivo
* neurochemical studies to investigate the roles of sex steroids upon neural circuitry involved in sexual attraction

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38377">{{redirect|Nucleogenesis|the song by Vangelis|Albedo 0.39}}'''Nucleosynthesis''' is the process that creates new [[atomic nuclei]] from pre-existing [[nucleon]]s, primarily protons and neutrons. The first nuclei were formed about three minutes after the [[Big Bang]], through the process called [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]. Seventeen minutes later the universe had cooled to a point at which these processes ended, so only the fastest and simplest reactions occurred, leaving our universe containing about 75% [[hydrogen]], 24% [[helium]], and traces of other elements such as [[lithium]] and the hydrogen [[isotope]] [[deuterium]]. The universe still has approximately the same composition today.

Heavier nuclei were created from these, by several processes. Stars formed, and began to [[stellar fusion|fuse]] light elements to heavier ones in their [[stellar core|cores]], giving off energy in the process, known as [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. Fusion processes create many of the lighter elements up to and including [[iron]] and [[nickel]], and these elements are ejected into space (the [[interstellar medium]]) when smaller stars shed their outer envelopes and become smaller stars known as [[white dwarfs]]. The remains of their ejected mass form the [[planetary nebula]]e observable throughout our galaxy.

[[Supernova nucleosynthesis]] within exploding stars by fusing carbon and oxygen is responsible for the abundances of elements between [[magnesium]] (atomic number 12) and [[nickel]] (atomic number 28).&lt;ref name=ClaytonIsotopes&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clayton |first1=D. D. |year=2003 |title=Handbook of Isotopes in the Cosmos |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=978-0-521-82381-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supernova nucleosynthesis is also thought to be responsible for the creation of rarer elements heavier than iron and nickel, in the last few seconds of a [[type II supernova]] event. The synthesis of these heavier elements absorbs energy ([[endothermic process]]) as they are created, from the energy produced during the supernova explosion. Some of those elements are created from the absorption of multiple neutrons (the [[R process]]) in the period of a few seconds during the explosion. The elements formed in supernovas include the heaviest elements known, such as the long-lived elements uranium and thorium.

[[Neutron star merger]]s and collisions are also responsible for many heavy elements, via the [[r-process]] ("r" stands for "rapid"). Neutron stars are extremely dense remnants of [[supernova]]e, and as their name suggests, they consist of a complex state of matter, predominantly made of tightly packed [[neutron]]s. When two such dense stars collide, a large amount of neutron-rich matter may be ejected at extremely high temperatures and under exotic conditions, and heavy elements may form as the ejecta begins to cool. In 2017, the merger of [[GW170817]] led to the detection of substantial signatures of [[gold]], [[platinum]] and other heavy elements over an extended period.

[[Cosmic ray spallation]], caused when [[cosmic rays]] impact the interstellar medium and fragment larger atomic species, is a significant source of the lighter nuclei, particularly &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He, &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Be and &lt;sup&gt;10,11&lt;/sup&gt;B, that are not created by stellar nucleosynthesis.

In addition to the fusion processes responsible for the growing abundances of elements in the universe, a few minor natural processes continue to produce very small numbers of new nuclides on Earth. These nuclides contribute little to their abundances, but may account for the presence of specific new nuclei. These nuclides are produced via [[radiogenesis]] (decay) of long-lived, heavy, primordial radionuclides such as uranium and thorium. Cosmic ray bombardment of elements on Earth also contribute to the presence of rare, short-lived atomic species called [[cosmogenic nuclide]]s.

==Timeline==
[[File:Nucleosynthesis periodic table.svg|thumb|600px|Periodic table showing the cosmogenic origin of each element. Elements from carbon up to sulfur may be made in small stars by the [[alpha process]]. Elements beyond iron are made in large stars with slow neutron capture ([[s-process]]), followed by expulsion to space in gas ejections (see [[planetary nebulae]]). Elements heavier than iron may be made in neutron star mergers or supernovae after the [[r-process]], involving a dense burst of neutrons and rapid capture by the element.]]

It is thought that the primordial nucleons themselves were formed from the [[quark–gluon plasma]] during the [[Big Bang]] as it cooled below two trillion degrees. A few minutes afterward, starting with only [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, nuclei up to [[lithium]] and [[beryllium]] (both with mass number 7) were formed, but the abundances of other elements dropped sharply with growing atomic mass. Some [[boron]] may have been formed at this time, but the process stopped before significant [[carbon]] could be formed, as this element requires a far higher product of helium density and time than were present in the short nucleosynthesis period of the Big Bang. That fusion process essentially shut down at about 20 minutes, due to drops in temperature and density as the universe continued to expand. This first process, [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], was the first type of nucleogenesis to occur in the universe.

The subsequent nucleosynthesis of the heavier elements requires the extreme temperatures and pressures found within [[star]]s and [[supernova]]s. These processes began as hydrogen and helium from the Big Bang collapsed into the first stars at 500 million years. Star formation has occurred continuously in galaxies since that time. Among the elements found naturally on Earth (the so-called [[primordial element]]s), those heavier than boron were created by [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] and by [[supernova nucleosynthesis]]. They range in [[atomic number]]s from Z=6 ([[carbon]]) to Z=94 ([[plutonium]]). Synthesis of these elements occurred either by [[nuclear fusion]] (including both [[r-process|rapid]] and [[s-process|slow]] multiple neutron capture) or to a lesser degree by [[nuclear fission]] followed by [[beta decay]].

A star gains heavier elements by combining its lighter nuclei, [[hydrogen]], [[deuterium]], [[beryllium]], [[lithium]], and [[boron]], which were found in the initial composition of the interstellar medium and hence the star. Interstellar gas therefore contains declining abundances of these light elements, which are present only by virtue of their nucleosynthesis during the Big Bang. Larger quantities of these lighter elements in the present universe are therefore thought to have been restored through billions of years of [[cosmic ray]] (mostly high-energy proton) mediated breakup of heavier elements in interstellar gas and dust. The fragments of these cosmic-ray collisions include the light elements Li, Be and B.

==History of nucleosynthesis theory==
The first ideas on nucleosynthesis were simply that the [[chemical elements]] were created at the beginning of the universe, but no rational physical scenario for this could be identified. Gradually it became clear that hydrogen and helium are much more abundant than any of the other elements. All the rest constitute less than 2% of the mass of the Solar System, and of other star systems as well. At the same time it was clear that oxygen and carbon were the next two most common elements, and also that there was a general trend toward high abundance of the light elements, especially those composed of whole numbers of helium-4 nuclei.

[[Arthur Stanley Eddington]] first suggested in 1920, that stars obtain their energy by fusing hydrogen into helium and raised the possibility that the heavier elements may also form in stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eddington |first1=A. S. |date=1920 |title=The Internal Constitution of the Stars |journal=[[The Observatory (journal)|The Observatory]] |volume=43 |issue= |page=341 |bibcode=1920Obs....43..341E}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eddington |first1=A. S. |date=1920 |title=The Internal Constitution of the Stars |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=106 |issue=2653 |pages=14–20 |bibcode=1920Natur.106...14E |doi=10.1038/106014a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was not generally accepted, as the nuclear mechanism was not understood. In the years immediately before World War II, [[Hans Bethe]] first elucidated those nuclear mechanisms by which hydrogen is fused into helium.

[[Fred Hoyle]]'s original work on nucleosynthesis of heavier elements in stars, occurred just after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Actually, before the war ended, he learned about the problem of spherical implosion of [[plutonium]] in the [[Manhattan project]]. He saw an analogy between the plutonium fission reaction and the newly discovered supernovae, and he was able to show that exploding super novae produced all of the elements in the same proportion as existed on Earth. He felt that he had accidentally fallen into a subject that would make his career. [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1983/fowler-autobio.html Autobiography William A. Fowler]&lt;/ref&gt; His work explained the production of all heavier elements, starting from hydrogen. Hoyle proposed that hydrogen is continuously created in the universe from vacuum and energy, without need for universal beginning.

Hoyle's work explained how the abundances of the elements increased with time as the galaxy aged. Subsequently, Hoyle's picture was expanded during the 1960s by contributions from [[William A. Fowler]], [[Alastair G. W. Cameron]], and [[Donald D. Clayton]], followed by many others. The [[B2FH paper|seminal 1957 review paper]] by [[Margaret Burbidge|E. M. Burbidge]], [[Geoffrey Burbidge|G. R. Burbidge]], Fowler and Hoyle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burbidge |first1=E. M. |last2=Burbidge |first2=G. R. |last3=Fowler |first3=W. A. |last4=Hoyle |first4=F. |year=1957 |title=Synthesis of the Elements in Stars |journal=[[Reviews of Modern Physics]] |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=547–650 |bibcode=1957RvMP...29..547B |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.29.547}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a well-known summary of the state of the field in 1957. That paper defined new processes for the transformation of one heavy nucleus into others within stars, processes that could be documented by astronomers.

The Big Bang itself had been proposed in 1931, long before this period, by [[Georges Lemaître]], a Belgian physicist, who suggested that the evident expansion of the Universe in time required that the Universe, if contracted backwards in time, would continue to do so until it could contract no further. This would bring all the mass of the Universe to a single point, a "primeval atom", to a state before which time and space did not exist. Hoyle later gave Lemaître's model the derisive term of Big Bang, not realizing that Lemaître's model was needed to explain the existence of deuterium and nuclides between helium and carbon, as well as the fundamentally high amount of helium present, not only in stars but also in interstellar space. As it happened, both Lemaître and Hoyle's models of nucleosynthesis would be needed to explain the elemental abundances in the universe.

The goal of the theory of nucleosynthesis is to explain the vastly differing abundances of the chemical elements and their several isotopes from the perspective of natural processes. The primary stimulus to the development of this theory was the shape of a plot of the abundances versus the atomic number of the elements. Those abundances, when plotted on a graph as a function of atomic number, have a jagged sawtooth structure that varies by factors up to ten million. A very influential stimulus to nucleosynthesis research was an abundance table created by [[Hans Suess]] and [[Harold Urey]] that was based on the unfractionated abundances of the non-volatile elements found within unevolved meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suess |first1=Hans E. |last2=Urey |first2=Harold C. |title=Abundances of the Elements |journal=[[Reviews of Modern Physics]] |date=1956 |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=53–74 |bibcode=1956RvMP...28...53S |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.28.53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a graph of the abundances is displayed on a logarithmic scale below, where the dramatically jagged structure is visually suppressed by the many powers of ten spanned in the vertical scale of this graph. See ''Handbook of Isotopes in the Cosmos'' for more data and discussion of abundances of the isotopes.&lt;ref name=ClaytonIsotopes/&gt;

[[Image:SolarSystemAbundances.svg|thumb|center|800px|Abundances of the chemical elements in the Solar System. Hydrogen and helium are most common, residuals within the paradigm of the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stiavelli |first1=Massimo |year=2009 |title=From First Light to Reionization the End of the Dark Ages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCLNBElRTS4C&amp;pg=PA8 |page=8 |publisher=[[Wiley-VCH]] |location=Weinheim, Germany |isbn=9783527627370}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next three elements (Li, Be, B) are rare because they are poorly synthesized in the Big Bang and also in stars. The two general trends in the remaining stellar-produced elements are: (1) an alternation of abundance of elements according to whether they have even or odd atomic numbers, and (2) a general decrease in abundance, as elements become heavier. Within this trend is a peak at abundances of iron and nickel, which is especially visible on a logarithmic graph spanning fewer powers of ten, say between logA=2 (A=100) and logA=6 (A=1,000,000).]]

==Processes==
There are a number of [[astrophysical]] processes which are believed to be responsible for nucleosynthesis. The majority of these occur in within stars, and the chain of those [[nuclear fusion]] processes are known as hydrogen burning (via the [[proton-proton chain]] or the [[CNO cycle]]), [[Helium fusion|helium burning]], [[Carbon burning process|carbon burning]], [[Neon burning process|neon burning]], [[Oxygen burning process|oxygen burning]] and [[silicon burning process|silicon burning]]. These processes are able to create elements up to and including iron and nickel. This is the region of nucleosynthesis within which the isotopes with the highest [[binding energy]] per nucleon are created. Heavier elements can be assembled within stars by a neutron capture process known as the [[s-process]] or in explosive environments, such as [[supernova]]e and [[neutron star merger]]s, by a number of other processes. Some of those others include the [[r-process]], which involves rapid neutron captures, the [[rp-process]], and the [[p-process]] (sometimes known as the gamma process), which results in the [[photodisintegration]] of existing nuclei.

==The major types of nucleosynthesis==

===Big Bang nucleosynthesis===
{{main|Big Bang nucleosynthesis}}
Big Bang nucleosynthesis&lt;ref&gt;http://www-pdg.lbl.gov/2017/mobile/reviews/pdf/rpp2016-rev-bbang-nucleosynthesis-m.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; occurred within the first three minutes of the beginning of the universe and is responsible for much of the abundance of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H ([[hydrogen-1|protium]]), &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H (D, [[deuterium]]), &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He ([[helium-3]]), and &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He ([[helium-4]]). Although &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He continues to be produced by stellar fusion and [[alpha decay]]s and trace amounts of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H continue to be produced by [[spallation]] and certain types of radioactive decay, most of the mass of the isotopes in the universe are thought to have been produced in the [[Big Bang]]. The nuclei of these elements, along with some &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li and &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be are considered to have been formed between 100 and 300 seconds after the Big Bang when the primordial [[quark–gluon plasma]] froze out to form [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s. Because of the very short period in which nucleosynthesis occurred before it was stopped by expansion and cooling (about 20 minutes), no elements heavier than [[beryllium]] (or possibly [[boron]]) could be formed. Elements formed during this time were in the plasma state, and did not cool to the state of neutral atoms until much later.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Stellar nucleosynthesis===
{{Main|Stellar nucleosynthesis|Proton-proton chain|Triple-alpha process|CNO cycle|s-process|p-process|photodisintegration}}

Stellar nucleosynthesis is the nuclear process by which new nuclei are produced. It occurs in stars during [[stellar evolution]]. It is responsible for the galactic abundances of elements from [[carbon]] to [[iron]]. Stars are thermonuclear furnaces in which H and He are fused into heavier nuclei by increasingly high temperatures as the composition of the core evolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clayton |first1=D. D. |year=1983 |title=Principles of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis |at=Chapter 5 |edition=Reprint |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago, USA |isbn=978-0-226-10952-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular importance is carbon because its formation from He is a bottleneck in the entire process. Carbon is produced by the [[triple-alpha process]] in all stars. Carbon is also the main element that causes the release of free neutrons within stars, giving rise to the [[s-process]], in which the slow absorption of neutrons converts iron into elements heavier than iron and nickel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clayton |first1=D. D. |last2=Fowler |first2=W. A. |last3=Hull |first3=T. E. |last4=Zimmerman |first4=B. A. |title=Neutron Capture Chains in Heavy Element Synthesis |journal=[[Annals of Physics]] |date=1961 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=331–408 |doi=10.1016/0003-4916(61)90067-7|bibcode=1961AnPhy..12..331C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ClaytonIsotopes7&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clayton |first1=D. D. |year=1983 |title=Principles of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis |at=Chapter 7 |edition=Reprint |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago, USA |isbn=978-0-226-10952-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The products of stellar nucleosynthesis are generally dispersed into the interstellar gas through mass loss episodes and the stellar winds of low mass stars. The mass loss events can be witnessed today in the [[planetary nebula]]e phase of low-mass star evolution, and the explosive ending of stars, called [[supernova]]e, of those with more than eight times the mass of the Sun.

The first direct proof that nucleosynthesis occurs in stars was the astronomical observation that interstellar gas has become enriched with heavy elements as time passed. As a result, stars that were born from it late in the galaxy, formed with much higher initial heavy element abundances than those that had formed earlier. The detection of [[technetium]] in the atmosphere of a [[red giant]] star in 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Merrill |first1=S. P. W. |date=1952 |title=Spectroscopic Observations of Stars of Class |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=116 |issue= |pages=21 |bibcode=1952ApJ...116...21M |doi=10.1086/145589}}&lt;/ref&gt; by spectroscopy, provided the first evidence of nuclear activity within stars. Because [[technetium]] is radioactive, with a half-life much less than the age of the star, its abundance must reflect its recent creation within that star. Equally convincing evidence of the stellar origin of heavy elements is the large overabundances of specific stable elements found in stellar atmospheres of [[asymptotic giant branch]] stars. Observation of barium abundances some 20-50 times greater than found in unevolved stars is evidence of the operation of the [[s-process]] within such stars. Many modern proofs of stellar nucleosynthesis are provided by the [[isotopes|isotopic]] compositions of [[Cosmic dust#Stardust|stardust]], solid grains that have condensed from the gases of individual stars and which have been extracted from meteorites. Stardust is one component of [[cosmic dust]] and is frequently called [[presolar grains]]. The measured isotopic compositions in stardust grains demonstrate many aspects of nucleosynthesis within the stars from which the grains condensed during the star's late-life mass-loss episodes.&lt;ref name=Clayton2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clayton |first1=D.

[[Supernova nucleosynthesis]] occurs in the energetic environment in supernovae, in which the elements between silicon and nickel are synthesized in quasiequilibrium&lt;ref name=Bodansky1968&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bodansky |first1=D. |last2=Clayton |first2=D. D. |last3=Fowler |first3=W. A. |date=1968 |title=Nuclear Quasi-Equilibrium during Silicon Burning |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series]] |volume=16 |issue= |pages=299 |bibcode=1968ApJS...16..299B |doi=10.1086/190176}}&lt;/ref&gt; established during fast fusion that attaches by reciprocating balanced nuclear reactions to &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Si. Quasiequilibrium can be thought of as ''almost equilibrium'' except for a high abundance of the &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Si nuclei in the feverishly burning mix. This concept&lt;ref name=ClaytonIsotopes7/&gt; was the most important discovery in nucleosynthesis theory of the intermediate-mass elements since Hoyle's 1954 paper because it provided an overarching understanding of the abundant and chemically important elements between silicon (A=28) and nickel (A=60). It replaced the incorrect although much cited [[alpha process]] of the [[B2FH paper|B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH paper]], which inadvertently obscured Hoyle's 1954 theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clayton |first1=D. D. |title=Hoyle's Equation |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=2007 |volume=318 |issue=5858 |pages=1876–1877 |bibcode=|doi=10.1126/science.1151167|pmid=18096793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further nucleosynthesis processes can occur, in particular the [[r-process]] (rapid process) described by the B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH paper and first calculated by Seeger, Fowler and Clayton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seeger |first1=P. A. |last2=Fowler |first2=W. A. |last3=Clayton |first3=D. D. |date=1965 |title=Nucleosynthesis of Heavy Elements by Neutron Capture |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series]] |volume=11 |issue= |pages=121 |bibcode=1965ApJS...11..121S |doi=10.1086/190111}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the most neutron-rich isotopes of elements heavier than nickel are produced by rapid absorption of free [[neutron]]s. The creation of free neutrons by [[electron capture]] during the rapid compression of the supernova core along with the assembly of some neutron-rich seed nuclei makes the r-process a ''primary process'', and one that can occur even in a star of pure H and He. This is in contrast to the B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH designation of the process as a ''secondary process''. This promising scenario, though generally supported by supernova experts, has yet to achieve a satisfactory calculation of r-process abundances. The primary r-process has been confirmed by astronomers who had observed old stars born when galactic [[metallicity]] was still small, that nonetheless contain their complement of r-process nuclei; thereby demonstrating that the metallicity is a product of an internal process. The r-process is responsible for our natural cohort of radioactive elements, such as uranium and thorium, as well as the most neutron-rich isotopes of each heavy element.

The [[rp-process]] (rapid proton) involves the rapid absorption of free [[proton]]s as well as neutrons, but its role and its existence are less certain.

Explosive nucleosynthesis occurs too rapidly for radioactive decay to decrease the number of neutrons, so that many abundant isotopes with equal and even numbers of protons and neutrons are synthesized by the silicon quasi-equilibrium process.&lt;ref name=Bodansky1968/&gt; During this process, the burning of oxygen and silicon fuses nuclei that themselves have equal numbers of protons and neutrons to produce nuclides which consist of whole numbers of helium nuclei, up to 15 (representing &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Ni). Such multiple-alpha-particle nuclides are totally stable up to &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca (made of 10 helium nuclei), but heavier nuclei with equal and even numbers of protons and neutrons are tightly bound but unstable. The quasi-equilibrium produces radioactive [[isobar (nuclide)|isobars]] &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ti, &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Cr, &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Fe, and &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Ni, which (except &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ti) are created in abundance but decay after the explosion and leave the most stable isotope of the corresponding element at the same atomic weight. The most abundant and extant isotopes of elements produced in this way are &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ti, &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Cr, and &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe. These decays are accompanied by the emission of gamma-rays (radiation from the nucleus), whose [[spectroscopic lines]] can be used to identify the isotope created by the decay. The detection of these emission lines were an important early product of gamma-ray astronomy.&lt;ref name=Clayton1969&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clayton |first1=D. D. |last2=Colgate |first2=S. A. |last3=Fishman |first3=G. J. |date=1969 |title=Gamma-Ray Lines from Young Supernova Remnants |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=155 |issue= |pages=75 |bibcode=1969ApJ...155...75C |doi=10.1086/149849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most convincing proof of explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae occurred in 1987 when those gamma-ray lines were detected emerging from supernova 1987A. Gamma-ray lines identifying &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Co and &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Co nuclei, whose radioactive half-lives limit their age to about a year, proved that their radioactive cobalt parents created them. This nuclear astronomy observation was predicted in 1969&lt;ref name=Clayton1969/&gt; as a way to confirm explosive nucleosynthesis of the elements, and that prediction played an important role in the planning for NASA's [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory|Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory]].

Other proofs of explosive nucleosynthesis are found within the stardust grains that condensed within the interiors of supernovae as they expanded and cooled. Stardust grains are one component of [[cosmic dust]]. In particular, radioactive &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ti was measured to be very abundant within supernova stardust grains at the time they condensed during the supernova expansion.&lt;ref name=Clayton2004/&gt; This confirmed a 1975 prediction of the identification of supernova stardust (SUNOCONs), which became part of the pantheon of [[presolar grains]]. Other unusual isotopic ratios within these grains reveal many specific aspects of explosive nucleosynthesis.

===Neutron star collision===
[[Neutron star collision]]s are believed to be the main source of r-process elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stromberg |first=Joseph |date=16 July 2013 |title=All the Gold in the Universe Could Come from the Collisions of Neutron Stars |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/all-the-gold-in-the-universe-could-come-from-the-collisions-of-neutron-stars-13474145/?page=1 |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine) |Smithsonian]] |accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being neutron-rich by definition, this has been suspected of being a source of such elements, but definitive evidence was difficult to obtain. In 2017 strong evidence emerged, when [[LIGO]], [[Virgo interferometer|VIRGO]], the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] and [[INTEGRAL]], along with a collaboration of many observatories around the world, detected both [[gravitational wave]] and electromagnetic signatures of a likely neutron star collision, [[GW170817]], and subsequently detected signals of numerous heavy elements such as gold as the ejected material began to cool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chu |first=J. |date=n.d. |url=https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/press-release-gw170817 |title=GW170817 Press Release |publisher=[[LIGO]]/[[Caltech]] |accessdate=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmic ray spallation===
{{main|Cosmic ray spallation}}
Cosmic ray spallation process reduces the atomic weight of interstellar matter by the impact with cosmic rays, to produce some of the lightest elements present in the universe (though not a significant amount of [[deuterium]]). Most notably spallation is believed to be responsible for the generation of almost all of &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He and the elements [[lithium]], [[beryllium]], and [[boron]], although some {{SimpleNuclide|Lithium|7}} and {{SimpleNuclide|Beryllium|7}} are thought to have been produced in the Big Bang. The spallation process results from the impact of [[cosmic rays]] (mostly fast protons) against the [[interstellar medium]]. These impacts fragment carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen nuclei present. The process results in the light elements beryllium, boron, and lithium in the cosmos at much greater abundances than they are found within solar atmospheres. The quantities of the light elements &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He produced by spallation are negligible relative to their primordial abundance.

Beryllium and boron are not significantly produced by stellar fusion processes, since &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be is not particle-bound.

==Empirical evidence==

Theories of nucleosynthesis are tested by calculating [[isotope]] abundances and comparing those results with observed abundances. Isotope abundances are typically calculated from the transition rates between isotopes in a network. Often these calculations can be simplified as a few key reactions control the rate of other reactions.

==Minor mechanisms and processes==

Tiny amounts of certain nuclides are produced on Earth by artificial means. Those are our primary source, for example, of [[technetium]]. However, some nuclides are also produced by a number of natural means that have continued after primordial elements were in place. These often act to create new elements in ways that can be used to date rocks or to trace the source of geological processes. Although these processes do not produce the nuclides in abundance, they are assumed to be the entire source of the existing natural supply of those nuclides.

These mechanisms include:
* [[Radioactive decay]] may lead to [[radiogenic]] [[daughter nuclide]]s. The nuclear decay of many long-lived primordial isotopes, especially [[uranium-235]], [[uranium-238]], and [[thorium-232]] produce many intermediate daughter nuclides before they too finally decay to isotopes of lead. The Earth's natural supply of elements like [[radon]] and [[polonium]] is via this mechanism. The atmosphere's supply of [[argon-40]] is due mostly to the radioactive decay of [[potassium-40]] in the time since the formation of the Earth. Little of the atmospheric argon is primordial. [[Helium-4]] is produced by alpha-decay, and the helium trapped in Earth's crust is also mostly non-primordial. In other types of radioactive decay, such as [[cluster decay]], larger species of nuclei are ejected (for example, neon-20), and these eventually become newly formed stable atoms.
* [[Radioactive decay]] may lead to [[spontaneous fission]]. This is not cluster decay, as the fission products may be split among nearly any type of atom. Thorium-232, uranium-235, and uranium-238 are primordial isotopes that undergo spontaneous fission. Natural technetium and [[promethium]] are produced in this manner.
* [[Nuclear reactions]]. Naturally-occurring nuclear reactions powered by [[radioactive decay]] give rise to so-called [[nucleogenic]] nuclides. This process happens when an energetic particle from radioactive decay, often an alpha particle, reacts with a nucleus of another atom to change the nucleus into another nuclide. This process may also cause the production of further subatomic particles, such as neutrons. Neutrons can also be produced in spontaneous fission and by [[neutron emission]]. These neutrons can then go on to produce other nuclides via neutron-induced fission, or by [[neutron capture]]. For example, some stable isotopes such as neon-21 and neon-22 are produced by several routes of nucleogenic synthesis, and thus only part of their abundance is primordial.
* Nuclear reactions due to cosmic rays. By convention, these reaction-products are not termed "nucleogenic" nuclides, but rather [[cosmogenic]] nuclides. Cosmic rays continue to produce new elements on Earth by the same cosmogenic processes discussed above that produce primordial beryllium and boron. One important example is [[carbon-14]], produced from nitrogen-14 in the atmosphere by cosmic rays. [[Iodine-129]] is another example.

'''Philip Layton Barlow'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Summaries of Doctoral Dissertations | journal=[[Harvard Theological Review]] | volume=82 | issue=4 | date=October 1989 | page=477 | jstor=1510113 | doi=10.1017/s0017816000030686}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born 1950) is a [[Harvard]]-trained scholar who specializes in [[American Religious History]], religious geography, and [[Mormonism]]. In 2007 he became the country’s first full-time professor of Mormon studies at a secular university by being appointed as the [[Leonard J. Arrington]] Chair of Mormon History and Culture at [[Utah State University]].

==Biography==

Barlow was raised in [[Bountiful, Utah]]. In 1975, he graduated with a B.A. in History from [[Weber State College]]. In 1980 and 1988, respectively, he received his Masters in Theological Studies and Doctorate of Theology (Th.D.) from the [[Harvard Divinity School]]. While in the Boston area, Barlow taught at the local LDS [[Institute of Religion]].  He also served as a counselor in a bishopric to [[Mitt Romney]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865561162/As-a-Mormon-leader-Bishop-Mitt-Romney-grew-learned-from-broadened-experiences.html Erik Schulzke "As a Mormon leader, Romney grew, learned from broadened experiences" ''Deseret News'' Aug 24, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the completion of his education, he served in consecutive years as a Mellon Post-doctoral Fellow at the [[University of Rochester]]. Prior to his arrival at [[Utah State University]], Barlow spent 17 years in the Department of Theological Studies at [[Hanover College]] in Indiana.

In 2017 Barlow held the first fellowship at the Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship at [[Brigham Young University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.hjnews.com/allaccess/usu-mormon-scholar-tapped-for-new-byu-fellowship/article_5607c985-6d9e-591e-929d-dd487df85640.html announcement on Barlow's fellowship appointment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==

Barlow's research interests have ranged over American religious and historical geography, concepts of “time” in secular and religious society, the problem of suffering and evil, and Mormon theology and practice.  Barlow's first book, ''[[Mormons]] and the [[Bible]]: The Place of the Latter-day Saints in American Religion'' (Oxford, 1991, 1997) analyzed Latter-day Saint uses of the biblical text, including issues revolving around the LDS Church’s official backing of the King James translation.  In 1992, the [[Mormon History Association]] awarded the volume its Best First Book Award.    His second book, the ''New Historical Atlas of Religion in America'' (co-authored with Edwin Scott Gaustad), examined the implications of religion’s connections with “place” and created hundreds of maps portraying the religious composition of the United States over time.  The Association of American Publishers named the work the “Best Single-volume Reference Book in the Humanities” for 2001.

==The Arrington Chair of Mormon History and Culture==

The establishment in 2007 of the Arrington Chair at Utah State University is one prominent symbol of a new era for the study of the Mormon faith in secular higher education.  It is part of the new Religious Studies Program at the University, the first program in Utah enabling students to major in religion.  Since the establishment in 2007 of the Arrington Chair, [[Richard Bushman]] has been inaugurated as the Howard W. Hunter Chair of Mormon Studies at [[Claremont Graduate University]] of Religion, [[Utah Valley University]] has continued to offer its students a minor in Religious Studies, the [[University of Utah]] has recently followed suit, with both programs showing interest in Mormonism, and the [[University of Wyoming]] is working to gather funds for a professorship in Mormon studies.

==Academic service==

In 2006, Philip Barlow was President of the [[Mormon History Association]], and currently serves on the Boards of Directors for the Society for Mormon Philosophy and Theology and the [[Dialogue Foundation]], on the Steering Committee for the [[American Academy of Religion]]’s new Consultation in Mormon Studies, and as a member of the editorial board of the Intermountain West Journal of Religious Studies.

{{Refimprove|lead|date=December 2011}}
A '''prologue''' or '''prolog''' from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πρόλογος ''prologos'', from πρό ''pro'', "before" and λόγος ''logos'', "word" is an opening to a story that establishes the context and gives background details, often some earlier story that ties into the main one, and other miscellaneous information. The Ancient Greek ''prólogos'' included the modern meaning of ''prologue'', but was of wider significance, more like the meaning of [[preface]]. The importance, therefore, of the prologue in [[Greek tragedy#Structure|Greek drama]] was very great; it sometimes almost took the place of a romance, to which, or to an episode in which, the play itself succeeded.

It is believed that the prologue in this form was practically the invention of [[Euripides]], and with him, as has been said, it takes the place of an explanatory first act. This may help to modify the objection which criticism has often brought against the Greek prologue, as an impertinence, a useless growth prefixed to the play, and standing as a barrier between us and our enjoyment of it. The point precisely is that, to an Athenian audience, it was useful and pertinent, as supplying just what they needed to make the succeeding scenes intelligible. But it is difficult to accept the view that Euripides invented the plan of [[Deus ex machina|producing a god out of a machine]] to justify the action of deity upon man, because it is plain that he himself disliked this interference of the supernatural and did not believe in it. He seems, in such a typical prologue as that to the ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', to be accepting a conventional formula, and employing it, almost perversely, as a medium for his ironic rationalism.

==Latin==
[[File:Prologue I.jpg|thumb|Artwork by Gustave Doré.]]
[[Image:Every Man in his Humour title page 1616.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Title page of 1616 printing of ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'', a 1598 play by the English playwright [[Ben Jonson]]. The play belongs to the subgenre of the "[[humours comedy]]"]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}
Many of the existing Greek prologues may be later in date than the plays they illustrate, or may contain large interpolations. On the Latin stage the prologue was often more elaborate than it was in Athens, and in the careful composition of the poems which [[Plautus]] prefixes to his plays we see what importance he gave to this portion of the entertainment; sometimes, as in the preface to the ''[[Rudens]]'', Plautus rises to the height of his genius in his adroit and romantic prologues, usually placed in the mouths of persons who make no appearance in the play itself.

[[Molière]] revived the Plautian prologue in the introduction to his ''[[Amphitryon (Molière)|Amphitryon]]''. [[Jean Racine|Racine]] introduced Piety as the speaker of a prologue which opened his choral tragedy of [[Esther]].

The tradition of the ancients vividly affected our own early dramatists. Not only were the [[mystery play]]s and miracles of the [[Middle Ages]] begun by a [[homily]], but when the drama in its modern sense was inaugurated in the reign of Elizabeth, the prologue came with it, directly adapted from the practice of Euripides and [[Terence]]. [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Sackville, Lord Buckhurst]], prepared a sort of prologue in dumb show for his ''[[Gorboduc (play)|Gorboduc]]'' of 1562; and he also wrote a famous [[Induction (play)|Induction]], which is, practically, a prologue, to a [[miscellany]] of short romantic epics by diverse hands.

==Elizabethan==

Prologues of Renaissance drama often served a specific function of transition and clarification for the audience. A direct address made by one actor, the prologue acted as an appeal to the audience's attention and sympathy, providing historical context, a guide to themes of the play, and occasionally, a disclaimer &lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 17&lt;/ref&gt;.  In this mode, a prologue, like any scripted performance, would exist as the text, the actor who speaks that text, and the presentation of the language as it is spoken.&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  In ushering the audience from the reality into the world of the play, the prologue straddles boundaries between audience, actors, characters, playwrights--basically, it creates a distinction between the imaginary space within the play and the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Jonson]] has often been noted as using the prologue to remind the audience of the complexities between themselves and all aspects of the performance.&lt;ref&gt;Cave, Richard, Elizabeth Schafer and Brian Wooland, Ben Jonson and Theatre, 1999. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The actor reciting the prologue would appear dressed in black, a stark contrast to the elaborate costumes used during the play.&lt;ref&gt;White, Martin, Renaissance Drama in Action, 1998. 125&lt;/ref&gt;  The prologue removed his hat and wore no makeup.  He may have carried a book, scroll, or a placard displaying the title of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  He was introduced by three short trumpet calls, on the third of which he entered and took a position downstage.  He made three bows in the current fashion of the court, and then addressed the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;
The Elizabethan prologue was unique in incorporating aspects of both classical and medieval traditions.&lt;ref name="BrusterDouglas"&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  In the classical tradition, the prologue conformed to one of four subgenres: the ''sustatikos'', which recommends either the play or the poet; the ''epitimetikos'', in which a curse is given against a rival, or thanks given to the audience; ''dramatikos'', in which the plot of the play is explained; and mixtos, which contains all of these things.&lt;ref name="BrusterDouglas" /&gt;  In the medieval tradition, expressions of morality and modesty are seen,&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 14&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a meta-theatrical self-consciousness, and an unabashed awareness of the financial contract engaged upon by paid actors and playwrights, and a paying audience.&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2009. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in fiction==
Prologues have long been used in non-dramatic fiction, since at least the time of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hXCi_DViuqwC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=prologue&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_1 Books.Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; although Chaucer had prologues to many of the tales, rather than one at the front of the book.

An R-value can be given for a material (e.g. for  [[polyethylene]] foam), or for an assembly of materials (e.g. a wall or a window). In the case of materials, it is often expressed in terms of R-value per unit length (e.g. per inch of thickness). The latter can be [[R-value_(insulation)#R-Value_Rule_in_the_U.S.|misleading]] in the case of low-density building thermal insulations, for which R-values are not additive: their R-value per inch is not constant as the material gets thicker, but rather usually decreases.&lt;ref name="Oak Ridge" /&gt; 

The units of an R-value (see [[R-value_(insulation)#Units:_metric_(SI)_vs._inch-pound_(I-P)|below]]) are usually not explicitly stated, and so it is important to decide from context which units are being used: an R-value expressed in [[United States customary units|I-P (inch-pound) units]]&lt;ref name="Heating, Cooling, Lighting I-P"&gt;{{cite book

The more a material is intrinsically able to conduct heat, as given by its [[thermal conductivity]], the lower its R-value. On the other hand, the thicker the material, the higher its R-value. Sometimes heat transfer processes ''other'' than conduction (namely, 
[[convection]] and [[Radiative transfer|radiation]]) significantly contribute to heat transfer within the material. In such cases, it is useful to introduce an ″apparent thermal conductivity″, which captures the effects of all three kinds of processes, and to define the R-value in general as &lt;math&gt;R=\frac{\scriptstyle\text{thickness of the specimen}}{\scriptstyle\text{apparent thermal conductivity}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="CRCThermal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rathore" /&gt; This comes at a price, however: R-values that include non-conductive processes may no longer be additive and may have significant temperature dependence. In particular, for a loose or porous material, the R-value per inch generally depends on the thickness, almost always so that it decreases with increasing thickness&lt;ref name="Oak Ridge" /&gt; ([[polyisocyanurate]] (″polyso″) being an exception; its R-value/inch ''increases'' with thickness&lt;ref name="polyso LLTR" &gt;{{Citation

The R-value is the reciprocal of the [[thermal transmittance]] ([[R-value (insulation)#U-factor.2FU-value|U-factor]]) of a material or assembly. The U.S. construction industry preferes to use R-values, however, because they are additive and because bigger values mean better insulation, neither of which is true for U-factors.&lt;ref name="Standardization" /&gt;

=={{anchor|U-value}}U-factor/U-value==
{{See also|Thermal transmittance}}
The ''U-factor'' or ''U-value'' is the [[Heat transfer coefficient#Overall heat transfer coefficient|overall heat transfer coefficient]] that describes how well a building element conducts heat or the rate of transfer of heat (in watts) through one square metre of a structure divided by the difference in temperature across the structure.&lt;ref name="U-Value Measurement Case Study"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenteg.com/applications/heat-flux-sensing/building-physics//|title=U-Value Measurement Case Study| accessdate=2014-10-29| offline= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The elements are commonly assemblies of many layers of components such as those that make up walls/floors/roofs etc. It measures the rate of heat transfer through a building element over a given area under standardised conditions.  The usual standard is at a temperature gradient of 24&amp;nbsp;°C (75.2&amp;nbsp;°F), at 50% [[humidity]] with no wind&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.p2000insulation.com|title=P2000 Insulation|website=www.p2000insulation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a smaller ''U-factor'' is better at reducing heat transfer). It is expressed in watts per meter squared kelvin (W/m²K). This means that the higher the U-value the worse the thermal performance of the building envelope. A low U-value usually indicates high levels of insulation. They are useful as it is a way of predicting the composite behavior of an entire building element rather than relying on the properties of individual materials.

In most countries the properties of specific materials (such as insulation) are indicated by the [[thermal conductivity]], sometimes called a k-value or lambda-value (lowercase λ). The thermal conductivity (k-value) is the ability of a material to conduct heat; hence, the lower the k-value, the better the material is for insulation. Expanded polystyrene (EPS) has a k-value of around 0.033 W/mK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isover.com/Our-solutions/Insulation-materials/Polystyrene-insulation|title=Foams|website=www.isover.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, phenolic foam insulation has a k-value of around 0.018 W/mK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epfa.org.uk/properties.htm|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160523154711/http://www.epfa.org.uk/properties.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-05-23|title=European phenolic foam association: Properties of phenolic foam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while wood varies anywhere from 0.15 to 0.75 W/mK, and steel has a k-value of approximately 50.0 W/mK.

==Units: metric (SI) vs. inch-pound (I-P)==

The SI (metric) unit of R-value is 
: [[square metre|square-metre]] [[kelvin]] per [[watt]] (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·K/W or, equally, m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·°C/W), 

whereas the I-P (inch-pound) unit is 
:[[square foot|square-foot]]·[[degree Fahrenheit]]·[[hour]]/[[British thermal unit]] (ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·°F·h/BTU).&lt;ref name="Heating, Cooling, Lighting I-P" /&gt; 

For R-values there is [[Comparison of the imperial and US customary measurement systems|no difference]] between [[United States customary units|US customary units]] and [[imperial units]], so the same I-P unit is used in both. 

Some sources use ″RSI″ when referring to R-values in SI units.&lt;ref name="Dictionary Weights" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Handbook Low-Energy Buildings RSI" /&gt;

R-values expressed in I-P units are approximately 5.68 times as large as R-values expressed in SI units.&lt;ref name="Handbook Low-Energy Buildings conversion" /&gt; For example, a window that is R-2 in the I-P system is about RSI 0.35, since 2/5.68 &amp;#8776; 0.35.

In countries where the SI system is generally in use, the R-values will also normally be given in SI units. This includes the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand.

I-P values are commonly given in the U.S. and Canada, though in Canada normally both I-P and RSI values are listed.&lt;ref name="Canada I-P and RSI" &gt;{{Citation

Because the units are usually not explicitly stated, one must decide from context which units are being used. In this regard, it helps to keep in mind that I-P R-values are 5.68 times larger than the corresponding SI R-values.

==Different insulation types==

The Australian Government explains that the required total R-values for the building fabric vary depending on climate zone. "Such materials include aerated concrete blocks, hollow expanded polystyrene blocks, straw bales and rendered extruded polystyrene sheets."&lt;ref&gt;"Building Code of Australia (BCA)". BCA 2013, Volume Two, Part 3.12 &lt;http://www.yourhome.gov.au/passive-design/insulation&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, after the law Energieeinsparverordnung (EnEv) introduced  in 2009 (October 10) regarding energy savings, all new buildings must demonstrate an ability to remain within certain boundaries of the U-value for each particular building material. Further, the EnEv describes the maximum coefficient for each new material if parts are replaced or added to standing structures.&lt;ref&gt;&lt; https://www.bgbl.de/xaver/bgbl/start.xav?startbk=Bundesanzeiger_BGBl&amp;jumpTo=bgbl107s1519.pdf#__bgbl__%2F%2F*%5B%40attr_id%3D%27bgbl107s1519.pdf%27%5D__1495584126681&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Department of Energy has recommended R-values for given areas of the USA based on the general local energy costs for heating and cooling, as well as the climate of an area. There are four types of insulation: rolls and batts, loose-fill, rigid foam, and foam-in-place.  Rolls and batts are typically flexible insulators that come in fibers, like fiberglass. Loose-fill insulation comes in loose fibers or pellets and should be blown into a space.  Rigid foam is more expensive than fiber, but generally has a higher R-value per unit of thickness.  Foam-in-place insulation can be blown into small areas to control air leaks, like those around windows, or can be used to insulate an entire house.&lt;ref&gt;"Insulation".  U.S. Department of Energy. USA.gov. October 2010. 14 November 2010. &lt;http://www.energysavers.gov/tips/insulation.cfm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thickness==
Increasing the thickness of an insulating layer increases the thermal resistance. For example, doubling the thickness of fiberglass batting will double its R-value, perhaps from 2.0&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;K/W for 110&amp;nbsp;mm of thickness, up to 4.0&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;K/W for 220&amp;nbsp;mm of thickness.  Heat transfer through an insulating layer is analogous to adding resistance to a series circuit with a fixed voltage. However, this only holds approximately because the effective thermal conductivity of some insulating materials depends on thickness.  The addition of materials to enclose the insulation such as sheetrock and siding provides additional but typically much smaller R-value.

==Factors==
There are many factors that come into play when using R-values to compute heat loss for a particular wall. Manufacturer R-values apply only to properly installed insulation.  Squashing two layers of batting into the thickness intended for one layer will increase but not double the R-value. (In other words, compressing a fiberglass batt decreases the R-value of the batt but increases the R-value per inch.) Another important factor to consider is that studs and windows provide a parallel heat conduction path that is unaffected by the insulation's R-value.  The practical implication of this is that one could double the R-value of insulation installed between framing members and realize substantially less than a 50 percent reduction in heat loss.  When installed between wall studs, even perfect wall insulation only eliminates conduction through the insulation but leaves unaffected the conductive heat loss through such materials as glass windows and studs. Insulation installed between the studs may reduce, but usually does not eliminate, heat losses due to air leakage through the building envelope. Installing a continuous layer of rigid foam insulation on the exterior side of the wall sheathing will interrupt thermal bridging through the studs while also reducing the rate of air leakage.

==Primary role==
The R-value is a measure of an insulation sample's ability to reduce the rate of heat flow under specified test conditions.
The primary mode of heat transfer impeded by insulation is conduction, but insulation also reduces heat loss by all three heat transfer modes: conduction, convection, and radiation.
The primary heat loss across an uninsulated air-filled space is [[natural convection]], which occurs because of changes in air density with temperature. Insulation greatly retards natural convection making conduction the primary mode of heat transfer. Porous insulations accomplish this by trapping air so that significant convective heat loss is eliminated, leaving only conduction and minor radiation transfer.
The primary role of such insulation is to make the thermal conductivity of the insulation that of trapped, stagnant air.  However this cannot be realized fully because the glass wool or foam needed to prevent convection increases the heat conduction compared to that of still air. 
The minor radiative heat transfer is obtained by having many surfaces interrupting a "clear view" between the inner and outer surfaces of the insulation such as visible light is interrupted from passing through porous materials.  Such multiple surfaces are abundant in batting and porous foam.  Radiation is also minimized by low emissivity (highly reflective) exterior surfaces such as aluminum foil.
Lower thermal conductivity, or higher R-values, can be achieved by replacing air with argon when practical such as within special closed-pore foam insulation because [[argon]] has a lower thermal conductivity than air.

== General ==

Heat transfer through an insulating layer is analogous to [[electrical resistance]]. The heat transfers can be worked out by thinking of resistance in series with a fixed potential, except the resistances are thermal resistances and the potential is the difference in temperature from one side of the material to the other. The resistance of each material to heat transfer depends on the specific thermal resistance [R-value]/[unit thickness], which is a property of the material (see table below) and the thickness of that layer. A thermal barrier that is composed of several layers will have several thermal resistors in the analogous with circuits, each in series. Analogous to a set of resistors in parallel, a well insulated wall with a poorly insulated window will allow proportionally more of the heat to go through the (low-R) window, and additional insulation in the wall will only minimally improve the overall R-value. As such, the least well insulated section of a wall will play the largest role in heat transfer relative to its size, similar to the way most current flows through the lowest resistance resistor in a parallel array. Hence ensuring that windows, service breaks (around wires/pipes), doors, and other breaks in a wall are well sealed and insulated is often the most cost effective way to improve the insulation of a structure, once the walls are sufficiently insulated.

Like resistance in electrical circuits, increasing the physical length (for insulation, thickness) of a resistive element, such as graphite for example, increases the resistance linearly; double the thickness of a layer means double the R-value and half the heat transfer; quadruple, quarters; etc. In practice, this linear relationship does not hold for compressible materials such as glass, wool, and cotton batting whose thermal properties change when compressed. {{clarify|reason=The relationship should hold as long the material is not compressed or stretched, shouldn't it?|date=May 2015}}

== Calculating heat loss ==

To find the average heat loss per unit area, simply divide the temperature difference by the R-value for the layer.

If the interior of a home is at 20&amp;nbsp;°C and the roof cavity is at 10&amp;nbsp;°C then the temperature difference is 10&amp;nbsp;°C (or 10&amp;nbsp;K). Assuming a ceiling insulated to RSI 2.0 (R = 2&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;K/W), energy will be lost at a rate of 10&amp;nbsp;K / (2&amp;nbsp;K·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/W) = 5&amp;nbsp;watts for every square meter of ceiling. The RSI-value used here is for the actual insulating layer (and not per unit thickness of insulation).

==Relationships==

===Thickness===
R-value should not be confused with the [[intrinsic property]] of thermal resistivity and its inverse, [[thermal conductivity]].  The SI unit of thermal resistivity is K·m/W.  Thermal conductivity assumes that the heat transfer of the material is linearly related to its thickness.

===Multiple layers===
In calculating the R-value of a multi-layered installation, the R-values of the individual layers are added:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/roofs+walls/insulation/ins_02.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112202600/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/roofs+walls/insulation/ins_02.html |archivedate=2007-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:R-value&lt;sub&gt;(outside air film)&lt;/sub&gt; + R-value&lt;sub&gt;(brick)&lt;/sub&gt; + R-value&lt;sub&gt;(sheathing)&lt;/sub&gt; + R-value&lt;sub&gt;(insulation)&lt;/sub&gt; + R-value&lt;sub&gt;(plasterboard)&lt;/sub&gt; + R-value&lt;sub&gt;(inside air film)&lt;/sub&gt; = R-value&lt;sub&gt;(total)&lt;/sub&gt;.

To account for other components in a wall such as framing, first calculate the U-value (=1/R-value) of each component, then the area-weighted average U-value.  The average R-value will be 1/(this average U-value).  For example, if 10% of the area is 4 inches of softwood (R-value 5.6) and 90% is 2 inches of silica aerogel (R-value 20), the area-weighted U-value is 0.1/5.6 + 0.9/20 = 0.0629 and the weighted R-value is 1/0.0629 = 15.9.

== Controversy ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2008}}

=== Thermal conductivity versus apparent thermal conductivity ===

[[Thermal conductivity]] is conventionally defined as the rate of thermal conduction through a material per unit area per unit thickness per unit temperature differential (ΔT). The inverse of conductivity is resistivity (or R per unit thickness). [[Thermal conductivity|Thermal conductance]] is the rate of heat flux through a unit area at the installed thickness and any given ΔT.

Experimentally, thermal conduction is measured by placing the material in contact between two conducting plates and measuring the energy flux required to maintain a certain temperature gradient.

For the most part, testing the R-value of insulation is done at a steady temperature, usually about {{convert|70|F|C}} with no surrounding air movement.  Since these are ideal conditions, the listed R-value for insulation will almost certainly be higher than it would be in actual use, because most situations with insulation are under different conditions

A definition of R-value based on apparent thermal conductivity has been proposed in document C168 published by the American Society for Testing and Materials.  This describes heat being transferred by all three mechanisms—conduction, radiation, and convection.

Debate remains among representatives from different segments of the U.S. insulation industry during revision of the U.S. FTC's regulations about advertising R-values&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/rulemaking/rvalue/review.shtm|title=Consumer Information|website=Consumer Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating the complexity of the issues.

=== Surface temperature in relationship to mode of heat transfer ===

There are weaknesses to using a single laboratory model to simultaneously assess the properties of a material to resist conducted, radiated, and convective heating.  Surface temperature varies depending on the mode of heat transfer.

In the absence of radiation or convection, the surface temperature of the insulator should equal the air temperature on each side.

In response to thermal radiation, surface temperature depends on the thermal [[emissivity]] of the material.  Light, reflective, or metallic surfaces that are exposed to radiation tend to maintain lower temperatures than dark, non-metallic ones.

Convection will alter the rate of heat transfer (and surface temperature) of an insulator, depending on the flow characteristics of the gas or fluid in contact with it.

With multiple modes of heat transfer, the [[sol-air temperature|final surface temperature]] (and hence the observed energy flux and calculated R-value) will be dependent on the relative contributions of radiation, conduction, and convection, even though the total energy contribution remains the same.

This is an important consideration in building construction because heat energy arrives in different forms and proportions.  The contribution of radiative and conductive heat sources also varies throughout the year and both are important contributors to [[thermal comfort]]

In the hot season, solar radiation predominates as the source of heat gain.  According to the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]], radiative heat transfer is related to the fourth power of the absolute temperature (measured in [[kelvin]]s: ''T'' [K] = ''T'' [°C] + 273.16).  Therefore, such transfer is at its most significant when the objective is to cool (i.e. when solar radiation has produced very warm surfaces). On the other hand, the conductive and convective heat loss modes play a more significant role during the cooler months. At such lower ambient temperatures the traditional fibrous, plastic and cellulose insulations play by far the major role: the radiative heat transfer component is of far less importance, and the main contribution of the radiation barrier is in its superior air-tightness contribution.
In summary: claims for radiant barrier insulation are justifiable at high temperatures, typically when minimizing summer heat transfer; but these claims are not justifiable in traditional winter (keeping-warm) conditions.

===The limitations of R-values in evaluating radiant barriers===
{{See also|Cool roofs}}

Unlike bulk insulators, [[radiant barrier]]s resist conducted heat poorly.  Materials such as reflective foil have a high thermal conductivity and would function poorly as a conductive insulator.
Radiant barriers retard heat transfer by two means: by reflecting radiant energy away from its surface and by reducing the emission of radiation from its opposite side.

The question of how to quantify performance of other systems such as radiant barriers has resulted in controversy and confusion in the building industry with the use of R-values or 'equivalent R-values' for products which have entirely different systems of inhibiting heat transfer. (In the U.S., the federal government's R-Value Rule establishes a legal definition for the R-value of a building material; the term 'equivalent R-value' has no legal definition and is therefore meaningless.)  According to current standards, R-values are most reliably stated for [[Building insulation materials|bulk insulation]] materials.  All of the products quoted at the end are examples of these.

Calculating the performance of [[radiant barrier]]s is more complex. With a good radiant barrier in place, most heat flow is by convection, which depends on many factors other than the radiant barrier itself. Although radiant barriers have high [[reflectivity]] (and low [[emissivity]]) over a range of electromagnetic spectra (including visible and UV light), their thermal advantages are mainly related to their emissivity in the infra-red range.  Emissivity values&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electro-optical.com/bb_rad/emissivity/matlemisivty.htm#Metals+and+Conversion+Coatings|title=FAQ     - EOI|website=www.electro-optical.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the appropriate metric for radiant barriers.  Their effectiveness when employed to resist heat gain in limited applications is established,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/publications/html/FSEC-CR-1231-01-es/|title=FSEC-CR-1231-01-ES|website=www.fsec.ucf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
even though R-value does not adequately describe them.

==Deterioration==

===Insulation aging===
R-values of products may deteriorate over time. For instance the compaction of loose fill cellulose creates voids that reduce overall performance; this may be avoided by densely packing the initial installation.  Some types of [[foam]] insulation, such as polyurethane and polyisocyanurate are blown with heavy gases such as [[Haloalkane|chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFC) or hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HFCs).  However, over time a small amount of these gases diffuse out of the foam and are replaced by air, thus reducing the effective R-value of the product. There are other foams which do not change significantly with aging because they are blown with water or are open-cell and contain no trapped CFCs or HFCs (e.g., half-pound low density foams).  On certain brands, twenty-year tests have shown no shrinkage or reduction in insulating value.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

This has led to controversy as how to rate the insulation of these products. Many manufacturers will rate the R-value at the time of manufacture; critics argue that a more fair assessment would be its settled value.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The foam industry {{When|date=August 2011}} adopted the LTTR (Long-Term Thermal Resistance) method,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.professionalroofing.net/archives/past/feb02/polyisofeature.asp  "Thermal resistance and polyiso insulation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609025242/http://www.professionalroofing.net/archives/past/feb02/polyisofeature.asp |date=2012-06-09 }} by John Clinton, ''Professional Roofing'' magazine, February 2002&lt;/ref&gt; which rates the R-value based on a 15-year weighted average. However, the LTTR effectively provides only an eight-year aged R-value, short in the scale of a building that may have a lifespan of 50 to 100 years.

===Infiltration===
Correct attention to air sealing measures and consideration of vapor transfer mechanisms are important for the optimal function of bulk insulators.  Air infiltration can allow convective heat transfer or condensation formation, both of which may degrade the performance of an insulation.

One of the primary values of spray-foam insulation is its ability to create an airtight (and in some cases, watertight) [[seal (mechanical)|seal]] directly against the substrate to reduce the undesirable effects of air leakage.

==R-value in-situ measurements==

The deterioration of R-values is especially a problem when defining the energy efficiency of an existing building. Especially in older or historic buildings the R-values defined before construction might be very different than the actual values. This greatly affects energy efficiency analysis. To obtain reliable data, R-values are therefore often determined via U-value measurements at the specific location (in situ). There are several potential methods to this, each with their specific trade-offs: thermography, multiple temperature measurements, and the heat flux method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shop.greenteg.com/wp-content/uploads/gSKIN_Application-note_U-Value-measurement-case-study.pdf|title=Case study: U-value measurement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermography===
Thermography is applied in the building sector to assess the quality of the thermal insulation of a room or building. By means of a thermographic camera thermal bridges and inhomogeneous insulation parts can be identified. However, it does not produce any quantitative data. This method can only be used to approximate the U-value or the inverse R-value.
[[File:GreenTEG U-value set-up.jpg|thumb|Heat flux measurement set-up]]
[[File:Software GreenTEG U-value Kit.JPG|thumb|Heat flux measurement results]]

===Multiple temperature measurements===
This approach is based on three or more temperature measurements inside and outside of a building element. By synchronizing these measurements and making some basic assumptions, it is possible to calculate the heat flux indirectly, and thus deriving the U-value of a building element. The following requirements have to be fulfilled for reliable results:

*	Difference between inside and outside temperature, ideal &gt; 15 K
*	Constant conditions
*	No solar radiation
*	No radiation heat nearby measurements

===Heat flux method===
The U-value can be calculated as well by using a heat flux sensor in combination with two temperature sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.greenteg.com/U-Value/|title=U-value and building physics|publisher=greenTEG|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By measuring the heat that is flowing through a building element and combining this with the inside and outside temperature, it is possible to define the U-value precisely. A measurement that lasts at least 72 hours with a temperature difference of at least 5&amp;nbsp;°C is required for a reliable result according to ISO 9869 norms, but shorter measurement durations give a reliable indication of the U-value as well. The progress of the measurement can be viewed on the laptop via corresponding software and obtained data can be used for further calculations. Measuring devices for such heat flux measurements are offered by companies like FluxTeq,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.FluxTeq.com/|title=Thermal Monitoring of Buildings|publisher=FluxTeq|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahlborn, greenTEG and Hukseflux.

==Example values==

{{Globalize/North America|date=January 2010}}

[[Vacuum insulated panel]]s have the highest R-value, approximately R-45 (in U.S. units) per inch; [[aerogel]] has the next highest R-value (about R-10 to R-30 per inch), followed by polyurethane (PUR) and phenolic foam insulations with R-7 per inch. They are followed closely by [[polyurethane|polyisocyanurate]] (PIR) at R-5.8, graphite impregnated expanded polystyrene at R-5, and [[polystyrene|expanded polystyrene]] (EPS) at R-4 per inch. Loose cellulose, fibreglass (both blown and in batts), and rock wool (both blown and in batts) all possess an R-value of roughly R-2.5 to R-4 per inch.

Straw bales perform at about R-1.5 per inch. However, typical [[Straw-bale construction|straw bale]] houses have very thick walls and thus are well insulated. Snow is roughly R-1 per inch. Brick has a very poor insulating ability at a mere R-0.2 per inch; however it does have a relatively good [[thermal mass]].

Note that the above examples all use the U.S. (non-SI) definition for R-value.

In practice the above surface values are used for floors, ceilings, and walls in a building, but are not accurate for enclosed air cavities, such as between panes of glass. The effective thermal resistance of an enclosed air cavity is strongly influenced by radiative heat transfer and distance between the two surfaces. See [[insulated glazing]] for a comparison of R-values for windows, with some effective R-values that include an air cavity.

=== ''R-Value Rule'' in the U.S. ===
The [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) governs claims about R-values to protect consumers against deceptive and misleading advertising claims.  "The Commission issued the R-Value Rule&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/r-value-rule&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary purpose of the rule is to ensure that the home insulation marketplace provides this essential pre-purchase information to the consumer.  The information gives consumers an opportunity to compare relative insulating efficiencies, to select the product with the greatest efficiency and potential for energy savings, to make a cost-effective purchase and to consider the main variables limiting insulation effectiveness and realization of claimed energy savings.

The rule mandates that specific R-value information for home insulation products be disclosed in certain ads and at the point of sale.  The purpose of the R-value disclosure requirement for advertising is to prevent consumers from being misled by certain claims which have a bearing on insulating value.  At the point of transaction, some consumers will be able to get the requisite R-value information from the label on the insulation package.  However, since the evidence shows that packages are often unavailable for inspection prior to purchase, no labeled information would be available to consumers in many instances.  As a result, the Rule requires that a fact sheet be available to consumers for inspection before they make their purchase.

====Thickness====
The R-value Rule specifies:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&amp;SID=21b94eefe259df18ad38c9a6400665cd&amp;ty=HTML&amp;h=L&amp;mc=true&amp;r=PART&amp;n=pt16.1.460&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|In labels, fact sheets, ads, or other promotional materials, do not give the R-value for one inch or the "R-value per inch" of your product. There are two exceptions:
:a. You can do this if you suggest using your product at a one-inch thickness.
:b. You can do this if actual test results prove that the R-values per inch of your product does not drop as it gets thicker.
You can list a range of R-value per inch. If you do, you must say exactly how much the R-value drops with greater thickness. You must also add this statement: "The R-value per inch of this insulation varies with thickness. The thicker the insulation, the lower the R-value per inch."

The '''Reference Daily Intake''' ('''RDI''') is the daily intake level of a [[nutrient]] that is considered to be sufficient to meet the [[Dietary requirements|requirements]] of 97–98% of healthy individuals in every [[demographic]] in the [[United States]]. While developed for the [[US population]], it has been adopted by other countries, though not universally.

The RDI is used to determine the '''Daily Value''' ('''DV''') of foods, which is printed on [[nutrition facts label]]s (as '''% DV''') in the United States and [[Canada]], and is regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and [[Health Canada]]. The labels "high", "rich in", or "excellent source of" may be used for a food if it contains 20% or more of the RDI. The labels "good source", "contains", or "provides" may be used on a food if it contains between 10% and 20% of the RDI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrient content claims for 'good source', 'high', 'more', and 'high potency', Specific Requirements for Nutrient Content Claims. Food Labeling, Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Chapter I, Subchapter B, Part 101, Subpart D, Section 101.54|url= https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=101&amp;showFR=1&amp;subpartNode=21:2.0.1.1.2.4|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|date=April 1, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The '''Recommended Dietary Allowances''' ('''RDAs''') were a set of nutrition recommendations that evolved into both the [[Dietary Reference Intake]] (DRI) system of nutrition recommendations (which still defines RDA values) and the RDIs used for food labelling.  The first regulations governing U.S. nutrition labels specified a ''% U.S. RDA'' declaration based on the current RDA values, which had been published in 1968. Later, the % U.S. RDA was renamed the %DV and the RDA values that the %DVs were based on became the RDIs.

The RDAs (and later the RDA values within the DRI) were regularly revised to reflect the latest scientific information, but although the [[nutrition labeling]] regulations were occasionally updated, the existing RDI values were not changed, so that until 2016 many of the DVs used on nutrition facts labels were still based on the outdated RDAs from 1968. In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration published changes to the regulations including updated RDIs and DVs based primarily on the RDAs in the current DRI.

The original deadline to be in compliance was July 28, 2018, but on September 29, 2017 the FDA released a proposed rule that extended the deadline to January 1, 2020 for large companies and January 1, 2021 for small companies.&lt;ref name="FDAdelay"&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm385663.htm#dates "Changes to the Nutrition Facts Panel – Compliance Date"]&lt;/ref&gt; In the interim, products with old or new facts panel content will be on market shelves at same time.

== History ==
The RDI is derived from the RDAs, which were first developed during [[World War II]] by [[Lydia J. Roberts]], [[Hazel Stiebeling]] and [[Helen S. Mitchell]], all part of a committee established by the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] to investigate issues of nutrition that might "affect national defense" (Nestle, 35).{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}} The committee was renamed the Food and Nutrition Board in 1941, after which they began to deliberate on a set of recommendations of a standard daily allowance for each type of nutrient. The standards would be used for nutrition recommendations for the armed forces, for civilians, and for overseas population who might need food relief. Roberts, Stiebeling, and Mitchell surveyed all available data, created a tentative set of allowances for "energy and eight nutrients", and submitted them to experts for review (Nestle, 35).{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}} The final set of guidelines, called RDAs for Recommended Dietary Allowances, were accepted in 1941. The allowances were meant to provide superior nutrition for civilians and military personnel, so they included a "margin of safety". Because of food rationing during the war, the food guides created by government agencies to direct citizens' nutritional intake also took food availability into account.

The Food and Nutrition Board subsequently revised the RDAs every five to ten years. In 1973, the FDA introduced regulations to specify the format of nutrition labels when present, although the inclusion of such labels was largely voluntary, only being required if nutrition claims were made or if nutritional supplements were added to the food. The nutrition labels were to include percent U.S. RDA based on the 1968 RDAs in effect at the time. The RDAs continued to be updated (in 1974, 1980 and 1989) but the values specified for nutrition labelling remained unchanged.&lt;ref name="iom-2010-history"&gt;{{cite book | title=Front-of-Package Nutrition Rating Systems and Symbols: Phase I Report | chapter=2 History of Nutrition Labeling | author=Institute of Medicine | date=2010 | doi=10.17226/12957 | chapter-url=https://www.nap.edu/read/12957/chapter/4 | publisher=The National Academies Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 the FDA published new regulations mandating the inclusion of a [[nutrition facts label]] on most packaged foods. Originally the FDA had proposed replacing the percent U.S. RDAs with percent daily values based on the 1989 RDAs but the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992 prevented it from doing so. Instead it introduced the RDI to be the basis of the new daily values. The RDI consisted of the existing U.S. RDA values (still based on the 1968 RDAs as the FDA was not allowed to change them at the time) and new values for additional nutrients not included in the 1968 RDAs.&lt;ref name="iom-2010-history"/&gt;

In 1997, at the suggestion of the [[Institute of Medicine]] of the National Academy, the RDAs became one part of a broader set of dietary guidelines called the [[Dietary Reference Intake]] used by both the United States and Canada. As part of the DRI, the RDAs continued to be updated.

On May 27, 2016, the FDA updated the regulations to change the RDI and Daily Values to reflect current scientific information.&lt;ref name=fda16/&gt;&lt;ref name=FedReg/&gt; Until this time, the Daily Values were still largely based on the 1968 RDAs. The new regulations make several other changes to the nutrition facts label to facilitate consumer understanding of the calorie and nutrient contents of their foods, emphasizing nutrients of current concern, such as [[vitamin D]] and [[potassium]].&lt;ref name=fda16/&gt; The revision to the regulations came into effect on 26 July 2016 and initially stipulated that larger manufacturers must comply within two years while smaller manufacturers had an additional year.&lt;ref name="fda16"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm385663.htm | title=Changes to the Nutrition Facts Label | publisher=United States Food and Drug Administration | work=FDA Labeling and Nutrition | date=May 20, 2016 | accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iom-2010-history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels | journal=Federal Register | date=May 27, 2016 | id={{Federal Register|81|33741}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 29, 2017 the FDA released a proposed rule that extended the deadline to January 1, 2020 for large companies and January 1, 2021 for small companies.&lt;ref name="FDAdelay"/&gt;

==Sodium==

In 2010, the U.S. [[Institute of Medicine]] determined that the government should establish new consumption standards for salt to reduce the amount of [[sodium]] in the typical American diet below levels associated with higher risk of several [[cardiovascular diseases]], yet maintain consumer preferences for salt-flavored food.&lt;ref name="iom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12818 |title=FDA should set standards for salt added to processed foods, prepared meals|publisher=U.S. National Academies of Science |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The daily maximum for sodium in the United States had been above estimated minimums for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/prof/heart/hbp/salt_up2.htm |title=Statement from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program |publisher=National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD |date=1999-10-14 |accessdate=2011-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320182203/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/prof/heart/hbp/salt_up2.htm |archivedate=2011-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] found that 500 milligrams of sodium per day (approximately 1,250 milligrams of table salt) is a safe minimum level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1349&amp;page=253 |title=Recommended Dietary Allowances: 10th Edition |publisher=The National Academies Press, Washington, DC |date= |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the daily allowance for salt is 6&amp;nbsp;g (approximately 2.5 teaspoons, about the upper limit in the U.S.), an amount considered "too high".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8376701.stm |title=Daily salt intake allowances 'were set too high' |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-11-25 |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3650578.stm |title=Britons told to cut salt intake |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-09-13 |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute of Medicine advisory stated (daily intake basis): "Americans consume more than 3,400 milligrams of sodium &amp;ndash; the amount in about 1.5 teaspoons of salt (8.7&amp;nbsp;g) – each day. The recommended maximum daily intake of sodium – the amount above which health problems appear – is 2,300 milligrams per day for adults, about 1 teaspoon of salt (5.9&amp;nbsp;g). The recommended adequate intake of sodium is 1,500 milligrams (3.9&amp;nbsp;g salt) per day, and people over 50 need even less."&lt;ref name=iom/&gt;

== Purpose  ==
Scion’s purpose is to drive innovation and growth from these sectors to build economic value and contribute to beneficial environmental and social outcomes for New Zealand.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; This is achieved through providing research, technology and knowledge in partnership with industry, government and Māori stakeholders, working in the following areas:

''Commercial forestry ''

Scion is working to maximise the value and productivity of New Zealand's commercial forests, by: 
* increasing wood quality and volume growth through a combination of genetic tree improvement and forest management 
* reducing the cost of harvesting trees 
* expanding the range of tree species that contribute to commercial forestry 
* enabling forest owners to maximise value from carbon forestry.

''Wood products and processing ''

The competitiveness of the solid wood processing industry is improved by Scion’s work to: 
* develop wood segregation technologies that improve productivity and reduce costs 
* encourage and enabling increased use of wood in construction 
* develop new product opportunities through wood modification technologies.

''Wood fibre, pulp, biopolymer and biochemical industries ''

Scion is expanding New Zealand’s opportunities for using wood fibres, biopolymers and biochemical by developing: 
* new product opportunities for the pulp and paper sector through biorefinery technologies 
* new composite products for manufacturers 
* renewable chemicals from forest biomass 
* new packaging products for food exporters.

''Risk and adaptation ''

New Zealand's ability to manage risks associated with biosecurity, fire and climate change has been improved by Scion’s work with government agencies, forest growers and science collaborators nationally and internationally to: 
* reduce the impacts of established pests and diseases 
* assist fire management agencies with protecting New Zealand's rural landscape 
* underpin effective biosecurity systems for New Zealand.

''Licence to operate ''

Through targeted research aimed at enhancing environmental performance, Scion protects the New Zealand forest industry's licence to operate domestically and internationally by: 
* assisting the forest and wood processing sectors to reduce their environmental footprint 
* developing tools that support land use management and optimise the multiple benefits of forestry in the landscape 
* providing technical information to support increased utilisation of wood.

''Bioenergy ''

Scion is increasing New Zealand's energy security by expanding the utilisation of forest biomass for energy. It leverages strong national and international research collaborations to: 
* develop technologies for producing heat, power and liquid fuels from woody biomass 
* support the development of a supply chain for woody biomass targeted at energy production.

== Databases and National Collections ==

Scion is home to databases and collections of national and international importance.

They are widely used to support diagnostic services, research, and the development of industry standards.

''National Forest Culture Collection''

This is an internationally registered living collection of almost 3000 fungal specimens (including some bacteria and lichens) stored in culture. Some pathogenic (disease causing) fungi from overseas are stored in a containment facility.

''National Forest Mycological Herbarium''

This internationally registered collection comprises almost 2000 dried fungal specimens and plant material containing fungi. The earliest collections date back to the late 1800s from Sweden.

''National Forestry Herbarium and Database''

The herbarium contains plants significant to plantation and indigenous forestry in New Zealand, including a wide range of native and amenity species. 

''National Forestry Library''

Publications and media relating to forestry and wood processing research over the last 75 years are held in the National Forestry Library at Scion. The library contains one of the largest collections of forestry, forest products, biomaterials, and pulp and paper literature in the Southern Hemisphere.

''Wood collection''

An extensive xylarium – a collection of wood samples consisting thousands of species from all over the world - is cared for at Scion. This collection can be used to compare samples with unknown timbers.

''Permanent Sample Plots database ''

Scion’s Permanent Sample Plot (PSP) system is a comprehensive database of forest growth data that underpins New Zealand’s commercial forest industry. The system contains information about the effect factors such as environment, genetics and silviculture regimes have on the growth of stands and trees.

The PSP system holds data from the 1920s, and has been in a digital format since the early 1960s. The digital platform is a flexible relational database that holds different types of forest data for both experimental research and commercial growth plots. These data are sourced from permanent sample plots that have been established, and regularly measured, in different forest types throughout New Zealand. In 2017, the system holds data from 32,000 PSPs of which 11,500 are current and 20,500 historic records. The PSP system is one of the most extensive data resources on tree growth, internationally.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

Scientists and forest companies use this information to understand how current forests are performing, and how future forests might grow under different conditions. These data support important forest management decisions.

== Scion Nursery  ==
The 10 hectare nursery in Rotorua has shade houses, controlled climate propagation facilities, commercial bare-root operations and a large purpose-built container-growing operation. The facility can on-grow 700,000 seedlings a year and is used for both research and commercial sales.

The work includes: 
* supporting advanced tree breeding programmes for radiata pine and other commercial forest species
* developing and using innovative propagation technologies 
* mass producing genetically improved tree stocks for forest growers 
* transferring expertise from tissue culture to the nursery and into the forest.

== History ==
Scion is the trading name for New Zealand Forest Research Institute Limited. The head office and main campus is in Rotorua on a site that was once the headquarters for a forest nursery for a large government afforestation programme. The nursery was established in 1898 at the edge of Whakarewarewa Forest where more than 60 exotic species were planted on 5000 hectares to determine which species grew best in New Zealand conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scionresearch.com/about-us/about-scion/who-we-are|title=Scion - Who we are|website=www.scionresearch.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research commenced on the campus in 1947 as a government-owned Forest Experiment Station. In 1949 it was officially renamed the Forest Research Institute (FRI) under the auspices of the New Zealand Forest Service.

In 1992 it was established as one of New Zealand’s Crown Research Institutes (CRI) as part of the government of the day’s science restructuring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scionresearch.com/about-us/about-scion/who-we-are|title=Scion - Who we are|website=www.scionresearch.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FRI, and later Scion, have become an internationally recognised leader in plantation forestry science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scionresearch.com/about-us/about-scion/who-we-are|title=Scion - Who we are|website=www.scionresearch.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the trading name Scion was adopted to reflect the growth of research programmes to include the development of new materials and energy from renewable resources and waste streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scionresearch.com/about-us/about-scion/who-we-are|title=Scion - Who we are|website=www.scionresearch.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Locations ==

Scion employs approximately 300 full-time equivalent staff, with its principal campus the main part of the Te Papa Tipu Innovation Park in [[Rotorua, New Zealand|Rotorua]]. It also has an office in [[Christchurch]] with close to 30 staff, as well as smaller offices in Wellington and Dunedin.

{{sociology}}

'''Social theories''' are analytical frameworks, or paradigms, that are used to study and interpret social phenomena.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Seidman, S., 2016. Contested knowledge: Social theory today. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; A tool used by [[social scientists]], social theories relate to historical debates over the validity and reliability of different methodologies (e.g. [[positivism]] and [[antipositivism]]), the primacy of either [[structure or agency]], as well as the relationship between contingency and necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2010. Beware of contingency. Environment and planning D: Society and Space, 28(3), pp.388-396. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/d2310?journalCode=epda &lt;/ref&gt;  Social theory in an informal nature, or authorship based outside of academic social and political science, may be referred to as "[[social criticism]]" or "[[social commentary]]", or "cultural criticism" and may be associated both with formal [[cultural studies|cultural]] and [[literary criticism|literary]] scholarship, as well as other non-academic or journalistic forms of writing.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== Definitions ==

'''Social theory''' by definition is used to make distinctions and generalizations among different types of societies, and to analyze [[modernity]] as it has emerged in the past few centuries.&lt;ref name=Callinicos&gt;{{cite book |title=Social Theory: A Historical Introduction |author=Callinicos, A. |year=1999 |publisher=New York University Press |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} Social theory as it is recognized today emerged in the 20th century as a distinct discipline, and was largely equated with an attitude of critical thinking and the desire for knowledge through ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' methods of discovery, rather than ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' methods of tradition.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}  

'''Social thought''' provides general theories to explain actions and behavior of society as a whole, encompassing [[sociology|sociological]], [[political science|political]], and [[philosophy|philosophical]] ideas. Classical social theory has generally been presented from a perspective of [[Western philosophy]], and often regarded as [[Eurocentric]].{{by whom?|date=July 2018}}

==History==

===Ancient===
[[Confucius]] (551–479 BCE) envisaged a just society that went beyond his contemporary society of the [[Warring States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macionis|first=John J.|author2=Plummer, Ken |year=2005|title=Sociology. A Global Introduction|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Harlow|edition=3rd|page=12|isbn=0-13-128746-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, also in China, [[Mozi]] (''circa'' 470 – ''circa'' 390 BCE) recommended a more pragmatic sociology, but ethical at base.

In the West, [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] (354–430) was concerned exclusively with the idea of the ''just society''. St. Augustine describes late [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] society through a lens of hatred and contempt for what he saw as false [[deity|Gods]], and in reaction theorized [[City of God (book)|City of God]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} [[Ancient Greek]] philosophers, including [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) and [[Plato]] (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BC), did not see a distinction between politics and society.  The concept of society did not come until  the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment period]].  The term, ''société'', was probably first used as key concept by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] in discussion of social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Heilbron, Johan |title=The Rise of Social Theory |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the enlightenment, social theory took largely [[narrative]] and [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] form. It was expressed as stories and fables, and it may be assumed the [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers and religious teachers were the precursors to social theory proper.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Medieval===
{{Main article|Sociology in medieval Islam|Muqaddimah|Asabiyyah}}

There is evidence of [[early Muslim sociology]] from the 14th century: in [[Ibn Khaldun]]'s ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (later translated as ''Prolegomena'' in [[Latin]]), the introduction to a seven volume analysis of [[universal history]], was the first to advance [[social philosophy]] and [[social science]] in formulating theories of [[Structural cohesion|social cohesion]] and [[social conflict]]. [[Ibn Khaldun]] is thus considered by many to be the forerunner of sociology.&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Akhtar&gt;Dr. S. W. Akhtar (1997). "The Islamic Concept of Knowledge", ''Al-Tawhid: A Quarterly Journal of Islamic Thought &amp; Culture'' '''12''' (3).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Khaldun|Khaldun's]] treatise described in ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' ''(Introduction to History)'', published in 1377, two types of societies: (1) the city or [[town]]-dweller and (2) the mobile, [[nomadic]] societies.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=== European social thought ===
[[Modernity]] arose during the Enlightenment period, with the emergence of the [[world economy]] and exchange among diverse societies, bringing sweeping changes and new challenges for society.  Many [[France|French]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]] intellectuals and [[philosopher]]s embraced the idea of progress and ideas of modernity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The Enlightenment period was marked by the idea was that with new [[Discovery (observation)|discoveries]] challenging the traditional way of thinking, scientists were required to find new normativity. This process allowed [[scientific knowledge]] and society to [[Social progress|progress]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}  French thought during this period focused on [[moral]] critique and criticisms of the [[monarchy]].&lt;ref name="Callinicos" /&gt;{{rp|15}} These ideas did not draw on ideas of the past from classical thinkers, nor involved following [[religion|religious]] teachings and authority of the [[monarch]]. 

A common factor among the classical theories was the agreement that the [[history of humanity]] is pursuing a fixed path. They differed on where that path would lead: [[social progress]], [[technological progress]], decline or even fall. Social cycle theorists were skeptical of the Western achievements and technological progress, but argued that progress is an illusion of the ups and downs of the historical cycles. {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} The classical approach has been criticized by many modern sociologists and theorists; among them [[Karl Popper]], [[Robert Nisbet]], [[Charles Tilly]] and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]].

The 19th century brought questions involving [[social order]].  The [[French Revolution]] freed French society of control by the monarchy, with no effective means of maintaining social order until [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] came to power.  Three great classical theories of social and historical change emerged: the [[social evolutionism]] theory (of which [[Social Darwinism]] forms a part), the [[social cycle theory]], and the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[historical materialism]] theory.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

19th-century classical social theory has been expanded upon to create newer, contemporary social theories such as [[Multilineal evolution|multilineal theories of evolution]] ([[neoevolutionism]], [[sociobiology]], [[theory of modernization]], [[theory of post-industrial society]]) and various strains of [[Neo-Marxism]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, social theory became closely related to academic [[sociology]], and other related studies such as [[anthropology]], [[philosophy]], and [[social work]] branched out into their own disciplines. Subjects like "[[philosophy of history]]" and other multi-disciplinary subject matter became part of social theory as taught under sociology.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

A revival of discussion free of disciplines began in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The [[Frankfurt School|Frankfurt Institute for Social Research]] is a historical example. The [[Committee on Social Thought]] at the [[University of Chicago]] followed in the 1940s. In the 1970s, programs in [[Social and Political Thought]] were established at [[University of Sussex|Sussex]] and [[York University|York]]. Others followed, with emphases and structures, such as [[Social Theory and History]] ([[University of California, Davis]]). [[Cultural Studies]] programs extended the concerns of social theory into the domain of [[culture]] and thus [[anthropology]]. A chair and undergraduate program in social theory was established at the [[University of Melbourne]]. Social theory at present seems to be gaining acceptance as a classical academic discipline.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==== Classical social theory ====
{{Main|History of sociology}}
[[Adam Ferguson]], [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], and [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]], among others, were the first to study society as distinct from political institutions and processes.  In the nineteenth century, the [[scientific method]] was introduced into study of society, which was a significant advance leading to development of [[sociology]] as a [[discipline]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In the 18th century, the pre-classical period of social theories developed a new form that provides the basic ideas for social theory, such as: [[evolution]], [[philosophy of history]], social life and [[social contract]], public and general will, competition in social space, [[organistic pattern]] for social description.
[[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], in ''The Spirit of Laws'', which established that social elements influence human nature, was possibly the first to suggest a universal explanation for [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Althusser, L. |title=Politics and History |year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Montesquieu included changes in [[mores]] and manners as part of his explanation of political and historic events.&lt;ref name="Callinicos" /&gt;{{rp|23}}

Philosophers, including [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Voltaire]], and [[Denis Diderot]], developed new social ideas during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period that were based on [[reason]] and methods of scientific inquiry.  [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in this time played a significant role in social theory. He revealed the origin of [[Social inequality|inequality]], analyzed the social contract (and social compact) that forms [[social integration]] and defined the social sphere or [[civil society]]. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] also emphasized that man has the liberty to change his world, an assertion that made it possible to program and change society.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[Adam Smith]] addressed the question of whether vast inequalities of wealth represented progress.  He explained that the wealthy often demand [[convenience]], employing numerous others to carry out [[employment|labor]] to meet their demands.{{Citation needed| date= March 2018}}  Smith argued that this allows wealth to be redistributed among inhabitants, and for all to share in progress of society.  Smith explained that social forces could regulate the [[market economy]] with social objectivity and without need for [[government]] intervention.  Smith regarded the [[division of labor]] as an important factor for economic progress.  [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]] suggested that improved status of [[women]] was important for progress of society.  Millar also advocated for [[Abolitionism|abolition]] of [[slavery]], suggesting that personal [[liberty]] makes people more industrious, ambitious, and [[productivity|productive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Meek, Rodney L. |title=Economics and Ideology and Other Essays |year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first "modern" social theories (known as classical theories) that begin to resemble the analytic social theory of today developed simultaneously with the birth of the science of sociology. [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857), known as the "father of sociology" and regarded by some as the first philosopher of science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/comte/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=19 October 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=19 October 2017|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; laid the groundwork for [[positivism]] – as well as [[structural functionalism]] and [[social evolutionism]]. [[Karl Marx]] rejected Comtean positivism but nevertheless aimed to establish a ''science of society'' based on [[historical materialism]], becoming recognised as a founding figure of sociology posthumously. At the turn of the 20th century, the first of German sociologists, including [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]], developed sociological [[antipositivism]]. The field may be broadly recognized as an amalgam of three modes of social scientific thought in particular; Durkheimian [[sociological positivism]] and [[structural functionalism]], Marxist historical materialism and [[conflict theory]], and Weberian [[antipositivism]] and [[verstehen]] critique.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Another early modern theorist, [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903), coined the term "[[survival of the fittest]]". [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1848–1923) and [[Pitirim A. Sorokin]] argued that "history goes in cycles," and presented the [[social cycle theory]] to illustrate their point. [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] (1855–1936) made ''community'' and ''society'' (''[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]]'', 1887) the special topics of the new science of "sociology", both of them based on different modes of [[will (philosophy)|will]] of [[social actor]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The 19th century pioneers of social theory and sociology, like Saint-Simon, Comte, Marx, [[John Stuart Mill]] or Spencer, never held university posts and they were broadly regarded as philosophers. Emile Durkheim endeavoured to formally established academic sociology, and did so at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895, he published ''[[Rules of the Sociological Method]]''. In 1896, he established the journal ''[[Année Sociologique|L'Année Sociologique]]''. Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a case study of suicide rates amongst [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, distinguished sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or [[philosophy]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

====Post-modern social theory====
{{Further information|post-modern feminism|postmodernism|post-structuralism}}
The term "postmodernism" was brought into social theory in 1971 by the Arab American Theorist [[Ihab Hassan]] in his book: ''The Dismemberment of Orpheus: Toward a Postmodern Literature''. In 1979 [[Jean-François Lyotard]] wrote a short but influential work ''[[The Postmodern Condition|The Postmodern Condition: A report on knowledge]]''. [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Roland Barthes]] were influential in the 1970s in developing postmodern theory.

Scholars most commonly hold ''[[postmodernism]]'' to be a movement of ideas arising from, but also critical of elements of [[modernism]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} The wide range of uses of this term resulted in different elements of modernity are chosen as being continuous. Each of the different uses is rooted in some argument about the nature of knowledge, known in philosophy as [[epistemology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allan, H Turnner|first=Kenneth, Jonathan|last2=Turner|first2=Jonathan H.|year=2000|title=A formalization of postmodern theory|journal=Sociological Perspectives|volume=43|issue=3|pages=363|doi=10.2307/1389533|issn=0731-1214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who use the term are arguing that either there is something fundamentally different about the transmission of meaning, or that modernism has fundamental flaws in its system of knowledge. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The argument for the necessity of the term states that economic and technological conditions of our age have given rise to a decentralized, media-dominated society. {{Citation needed| date= March 2018}} These ideas are [[simulacra]], and only inter-referential representations and copies of each other, with no real original, stable or objective source for [[communication]] and meaning. [[Globalization]], brought on by innovations in communication, [[manufacturing]] and [[transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=L Arxer|first=Steven|year=2008|title=Addressing postmodern concerns on the border: globalization, the nation-state, hybridity, and social change|journal=Tamara Journal of Critical Organisation Inquiry|volume=7|issue=1/2|pages=179|issn=1532-5555}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globalization is cited as one force which has decentralized modern life, creating a culturally pluralistic and interconnected global society, lacking any single dominant center of political power, communication, or intellectual production. The postmodern view is that inter-subjective knowledge, and not objective knowledge, is the dominant form of [[discourse]]. The ubiquity of copies and dissemination alters the relationship between reader and what is read, between observer and the observed, between those who consume and those who produce.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} 

Not all people who use the term postmodern or postmodernism see these developments as positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petrov|first=Igor|year=2003|title=Globalization as a Postmodern Phenomenon|journal=International Affairs|volume=49|issue=6|pages=127|issn=0130-9641}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users of the term argue that their ideals have arisen as the result of particular economic and social conditions, including "[[late capitalism]]", the growth of [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] media, and that such conditions have pushed society into a new [[historical period]].

====Today====
In the past few decades, in response to postmodern critiques, {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} social theory has begun to stress free will, individual choice, subjective reasoning, and the importance of unpredictable events in place of [[determinism|deterministic necessity]]. [[Rational choice theory]], [[symbolic interactionism]], [[False necessity]] are examples of more recent developments. A view among contemporary sociologists is that there are no great unifying 'laws of history', but rather smaller, more specific, and more complex laws that govern society.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]] recently attempted to revise classical social theory by exploring how things fit together, rather than to provide an all encompassing single explanation of a universal reality. He begins by recognizing the key insight of classical social theory of society as an artifact, and then by discarding the law-like characteristics forcibly attached to it. Unger argues that classical social theory was born proclaiming that society is made and imagined, and not the expression of an underlying natural order, but at the same time its capacity was checked by the equally prevalent ambition to create law-like explanations of history and social development. The [[human sciences]] that developed claimed to identify a small number of possible types of social organization that coexisted or succeeded one another through inescapable developmental tendencies or deep-seated economic organization or psychological constraints. [[Marxism]] is the star example.&lt;ref name="Unger"&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Theory: Its situation and its task|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}

Unger, calling his efforts "super-theory", has thus sought to develop a comprehensive view of history and society. Unger does so without subsuming deep structure analysis under an indivisible and repeatable type of social organization or with recourse to law-like constraints and tendencies.&lt;ref name="Unger" /&gt;{{rp|165}} His articulation of such a theory is in ''False Necessity: anti-necessitarian social theory in the service of radical democracy,'' where he uses deep-logic practice to theorize human social activity through anti-necessitarian analysis.

Unger begins by formulating the theory of false necessity, which claims that social worlds are the artifact of human endeavors. There is no pre-set institutional arrangement that societies must adhere to, and there is no necessary historical mold of development that they will follow. We are free to choose and to create the forms and the paths that our societies will take. However, this does not give license to absolute contingency. Unger finds that there are groups of institutional arrangements that work together to bring about certain institutional forms—liberal democracy, for example. These forms are the basis of a social structure, which Unger calls [[formative context]]. In order to explain how we move from one formative context to another without the conventional social theory constraints of historical necessity (e.g. feudalism to capitalism), and to do so while remaining true to the key insight of individual human empowerment and [[anti-necessitarian social thought]], Unger recognized that there are an infinite number of ways of resisting social and institutional constraints, which can lead to an infinite number of outcomes. This variety of forms of resistance and [[empowered democracy|empowerment]] make change possible. Unger calls this empowerment [[negative capability]]. However, Unger adds that these outcomes are always reliant on the forms from which they spring. The new world is built upon the existing one.&lt;ref name="fn 35"&gt;{{cite book|title=False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition|last=Unger|first=Roberto|publisher=Verso|year=2004|isbn=978-1-85984-331-4|location=London|pages=35–36, 164, 169, 278–80, 299–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools of thought==

===Chicago school===
{{Main|Chicago School (sociology)}}
The [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] developed in the 1920s, through the work of [[Albion Woodbury Small]], [[W. I. Thomas]], [[Ernest W. Burgess]], [[Robert E. Park]], [[Ellsworth Faris]], [[George Herbert Mead]], and other sociologists at the [[University of Chicago]].  The Chicago school focused on patterns and arrangement of social phenomenon across [[time]] and [[Location (geography)|place]], and within context of other social variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Abbott, Andrew|year=1997|title=Of Time and Space: The Contemporary Relevance of the Chicago School|journal=Social Forces|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|volume=75|issue=4|pages=1149–82|doi=10.2307/2580667|jstor=2580667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical theory===
{{Main|Critical theory}}
[[Critical theory (Frankfurt School)|Critical theorists]] rejected the "objective", scientific approach, and sought to frame theories within [[ideology|ideologies]] of [[human freedom]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Marxism===
{{Main|Marxism}}
[[Karl Marx]] wrote and theorized about the importance of [[political economy]] on society, and focused on the "material conditions" of life.&lt;ref name="Callinicos" /&gt;{{rp|4}} His theories centered around capitalism and its affect on class-struggle between the  [[proletariat]] and [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm|title=The German Ideology.

===Postmodernism===
{{Main|Postmodernism}}
Postmodernism was defined by [[Jean-François Lyotard]] as "incredulity towards [[metanarratives]]" and contrasted that with [[Modernism|modern]] which he described as "any science that legitimates itself with reference to a [[metadiscourse]]... making an explicit appeal to some grand narrative, such as the dialectics of Spirit the hermeneutics of meaning, the emancipation of the rational or working subject, or the creation of wealth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Postmodern Condition|author=Lyotard, Jean-François|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In academic practices==
Social theory seeks to question why humans inhabit the world the way they do, and how that came to be by looking at power relations, social structures, and  social norms,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56608295|title=Modern social theory : an introduction|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Harrington, Austin, 1970-|isbn=9780199255702|location=Oxford|oclc=56608295}}&lt;/ref&gt; while also examining how humans relate to each other and the society they find themselves in, how this has changed over time and in different cultures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/232358185|title=Contemporary social theory : an introduction|last=1964-|first=Elliott, Anthony,|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415386333|location=London|oclc=232358185}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the tools used to measure those things. Social theory looks to [[interdisciplinarity]], combining knowledge from multiple academic disciplines in order to enlighten these complex issues,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and can draw on ideas from fields as diverse as [[anthropology]] and [[media studies]]. 

Social theory guides scientific inquiry by promoting scientists to think about which topics are suitable for investigation and how they should measure them. Selecting or creating appropriate theory for use in examining an issue is an important skill for any researcher. Important distinctions: a ''theoretical orientation'' (or [[paradigm]]) is a worldview, the lens through which one organizes experience (i.e. thinking of human interaction in terms of power or exchange). A ''theory'' is an attempt to explain and predict behavior in particular contexts. A theoretical orientation cannot be proven or disproven; a theory can. 

Having a theoretical orientation that sees the world in terms of power and control, one could create a theory about violent human behavior which includes specific causal statements (e.g. being the victim of physical abuse leads to psychological problems). This could lead to a [[hypothesis]] (prediction) about what one expects to see in a particular sample, e.g. "a battered child will grow up to be shy or violent". One can then test the hypothesis by looking to see if it is consistent with [[data]]. One might, for instance, review hospital records to find children who were abused, then track them down and administer a personality test to see if they show signs of being violent or shy. The selection of an appropriate (i.e. useful) theoretical orientation within which to develop a potentially helpful theory is the bedrock of social science.

=== Example of questions posed by social theorists ===
Philosophical questions addressed by social thinkers often centered around [[modernity]], including:
* Can human reason make sense of the social world and shape it for the better?
* Did the development of modern societies, with vast inequalities in wealth among citizens, constitute progress?
* How do particular government interventions and regulations impact natural social processes?
* Should the economy/market be regulated or not?
Other issues relating to modernity that were addressed by social thinkers include [[Atomism (social)|social atomization]], [[Social alienation|alienation]], [[loneliness]], [[social disorganization]], and [[secularization]].

{{Spanish language}}
The term '''Spanish as a second or foreign language''' is the learning or teaching of the [[Spanish language]] for those whose [[first language]] is not Spanish.

==Regional programmes==

===Argentina===
In October 2001, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology and the Ministry of Foreign Relations, International Commerce and Culture of the Argentine Republic approved the guidelines in order to evaluate the knowledge and use of Spanish as a Second or Foreign Language in [[Argentina]]. Known as the ''''''Resoluciones 919 del MECyT and 3164 MRREECIyC)'''''', it recognised the role of universities in the development of the evaluation.

Meanwhile in 2004, a group of national universities created an inter-university consortium oriented towards the teaching, evaluation and certification of Spanish as a Second or Foreign Language (o '''ELSE''' from the Spanish, '''Español como Lengua Segunda y Extranjera'''), aiming to contribute to political and educational linguistics.

By June of the same year, three national universities (University of Buenos Aires (UBA), Universidad Litoral (UNL) and the University of Córdoba (UNC)) were working together to design and implement the first official examination to measure competence of Spanish as a foreign language. The exam is called CELU ([[Certificate of Use of Language in Spanish]])) and was approved by Resolution 28 in January 2005.

====The Certification of Spanish Language and Use====
{{Main article|Certificate of Use of Language in Spanish}}

The CELU (Certificate of Use of Language in Spanish) is a certificate of competence in the Spanish language from [[Argentina]]. Like the [[DELE]] (Diploma de Español como Lengua Extranjera), it also has international validity. The Certificate can be taken by speakers of any language other than Spanish in order to validate their knowledge of Spanish as a second language in their work or study.

In [[Argentina]] it is the only examination officially recognised by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Culture. Any speaker who can use Spanish in an effective manner, whose goal is to interact efficiently with the other members of the community can take the CELU, independently of the course or method that was used to learn the language.

===Spain===
'''Español como lengua extranjera''' ('''ELE''') is the term used to refer to various systems used by different learning institutions that teach the [[Spanish language]] to speakers of other languages, like the [[Escuelas Oficiales de Idiomas]] and the [[Instituto Cervantes]].

Following the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] or the ''CEFR'', these institutions offer examinations that will measure the competence of a learner. There are six exams (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2) which can be taken independently (i.e. it is not necessary to pass A1 to get B2) no matter the method of instruction used by the learners.

[[Español en Toledo]], a Spanish course started by the University of Castile-La Mancha General Foundation, brings students to monuments and historical sites in the city of [[Toledo, Spain]] for more experiential learning.

====Diplomas de Español como Lengua Extranjera====
The "[[Diplomas de Español como Lengua Extranjera]]" (Certificates of Spanish as a Foreign Language) is an official diploma granted by the [[Instituto Cervantes]] on behalf of the [[Ministry of Education (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of Education]] to evaluate a person's knowledge of [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

There are six levels of qualification, each corresponding to a certain level described by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages:
#Diploma de Español (Nivel A1) (level A1): This qualification attests to sufficient linguistic ability for a very basic range of the most commonly simple expressions used in the Spanish-speaking world and in order to satisfy immediate needs of a concrete type.

[[Image:Snow-cholera-map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map by Dr. [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] of [[London]], showing [[cluster (epidemiology)|cluster]]s of cholera cases in the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. This was one of the first uses of map-based spatial analysis.]] '''Spatial analysis''' or '''spatial statistics''' includes any of the formal [[Scientific technique|techniques]]  which study entities using their [[topological]], [[geometric]], or [[geographic]] properties. Spatial analysis includes a variety of techniques, many still in their early development, using different analytic approaches and applied in fields as diverse as [[astronomy]], with its studies of the placement of galaxies in the [[cosmos]], to chip fabrication engineering, with its use of "place and route" [[algorithm]]s to build complex wiring structures. In a more restricted sense, spatial analysis is the technique applied to structures at the human scale, most notably in the analysis of [[geographic data]].

Complex issues arise in spatial analysis, many of which are neither clearly defined nor completely resolved, but form the basis for current research. The most fundamental of these is the problem of defining the spatial location of the entities being studied.

Classification of the techniques of spatial analysis is difficult because of the large number of different fields of research involved, the different fundamental approaches which can be chosen, and the many forms the data can take.

== History of spatial analysis ==
Spatial analysis can perhaps be considered{{according to|date=February 2018}} to have arisen with early attempts at [[cartography]] and [[surveying]] but many fields have contributed to its rise in modern form. [[Biology]] contributed through [[botany|botanical]] studies of global plant distributions and local plant locations, [[ethology|ethological]] studies of animal movement, [[landscape ecology|landscape ecological]] studies of vegetation blocks, [[ecology|ecological]] studies of spatial population dynamics, and the study of [[biogeography]]. [[Epidemiology]] contributed with early work on disease mapping, notably [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s work of mapping an outbreak of cholera, with research on mapping the spread of disease and with location studies for health care delivery. [[Statistics]] has contributed greatly through work in spatial statistics. [[Economics]] has contributed notably through [[spatial econometrics]]. [[Geographic information system]] is currently a major contributor due to the importance of geographic software in the modern analytic toolbox. [[Remote sensing]] has contributed extensively in morphometric and clustering analysis. [[Computer science]] has contributed extensively through the study of algorithms, notably in [[computational geometry]]. [[Mathematics]] continues to provide the fundamental tools for analysis and to reveal the complexity of the spatial realm, for example, with recent work on [[fractals]] and [[scale invariance]]. [[Scientific modelling]] provides a useful framework for new approaches.

== Fundamental issues in spatial analysis ==
Spatial analysis confronts many fundamental issues in the definition of its objects of study, in the construction of the analytic operations to be used, in the use of computers for analysis, in the limitations and particularities of the analyses which are known, and in the presentation of analytic results. Many of these issues are active subjects of modern research.

Common errors often arise in spatial analysis, some due to the mathematics of space, some due to the particular ways data are presented spatially, some due to the tools which are available. Census data, because it protects individual privacy by aggregating data into local units, raises a number of statistical issues. The fractal nature of coastline makes precise measurements of its length difficult if not impossible. A computer software fitting straight lines to the curve of a coastline, can easily calculate the lengths of the lines which it defines. However these straight lines may have no inherent meaning in the real world, as was shown for the [[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|coastline of Britain]].

These problems represent a challenge in spatial analysis because of the power of maps as media of presentation. When results are presented as maps, the presentation combines spatial data which are generally accurate with analytic results which may be inaccurate, leading to an impression that analytic results are more accurate than the data would indicate.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Monmonier ''How to Lie with Maps'' University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spatial characterization ===
[[File:Bubonic plague-en.svg|thumb|240px|Spread of bubonic plague in medieval Europe.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The colors indicate the spatial distribution of plague outbreaks over time.]]The definition of the spatial presence of an entity constrains the possible analysis which can be applied to that entity and influences the final conclusions that can be reached. While this property is fundamentally true of all [[analysis]], it is particularly important in spatial analysis because the tools to define and study entities favor specific characterizations of the entities being studied. Statistical techniques favor the spatial definition of objects as points because there are very few statistical techniques which operate directly on line, area, or volume elements. Computer tools favor the spatial definition of objects as homogeneous and separate elements because of the limited number of [[database]] elements and computational structures available, and the ease with which these primitive structures can be created.

=== Spatial dependency or auto-correlation ===
{{see also|Spatial association}}
Spatial dependency is the co-variation of properties within geographic space: characteristics at proximal locations appear to be correlated, either positively or negatively. Spatial dependency leads to the spatial [[autocorrelation]] problem in statistics since, like temporal autocorrelation, this violates standard statistical techniques that assume independence among observations. For example, [[Regression analysis|regression]] analyses that do not compensate for spatial dependency can have unstable parameter estimates and yield unreliable significance tests. Spatial regression models (see below) capture these relationships and do not suffer from these weaknesses. It is also appropriate to view spatial dependency as a source of information rather than something to be corrected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knegt | first1 = De | last2 = Coughenour | first2 = M.B. | last3 = Skidmore | first3 = A.K. | last4 = Heitkönig | first4 = I.M.A. | last5 = Knox | first5 = N.M. | last6 = Slotow | first6 = R. | last7 = Prins | first7 = H.H.T. | year = 2010 | title = Spatial autocorrelation and the scaling of species–environment relationships | journal = Ecology | volume = 91 | issue = 8| pages = 2455–2465 | doi = 10.1890/09-1359.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locational effects also manifest as spatial [[heterogeneity]], or the apparent variation in a process with respect to location in geographic space. Unless a space is uniform and boundless, every location will have some degree of uniqueness relative to the other locations. This affects the spatial dependency relations and therefore the spatial process. Spatial heterogeneity means that overall parameters estimated for the entire system may not adequately describe the process at any given location.

=== Scaling ===
Spatial [[measurement]] scale is a persistent issue in spatial analysis; more detail is available at the [[modifiable areal unit problem]] (MAUP) topic entry. Landscape ecologists developed a series of [[scale invariant]] metrics for aspects of ecology that are [[fractal]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halley|first=J. M.|last2=Hartley|first2=S.|last3=Kallimanis|first3=A. S.|last4=Kunin|first4=W. E.|last5=Lennon|first5=J. J.|last6=Sgardelis|first6=S. P.|date=2004-03-01|title=Uses and abuses of fractal methodology in ecology|journal=Ecology Letters|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=254–271|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00568.x|issn=1461-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more general terms, no scale independent method of [[analysis]] is widely agreed upon for spatial statistics.

=== Sampling ===
Spatial [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] involves determining a limited number of locations in geographic space for faithfully measuring phenomena that are subject to dependency and heterogeneity. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Dependency suggests that since one location can predict the value of another location, we do not need observations in both places.  But heterogeneity suggests that this relation can change across space, and therefore we cannot trust an observed degree of dependency beyond a region that may be small.  Basic spatial sampling schemes include random, clustered and systematic. These basic schemes can be applied at multiple levels in a designated spatial hierarchy (e.g., urban area, city, neighborhood). It is also possible to exploit ancillary data, for example, using property values as a guide in a spatial sampling scheme to measure educational attainment and income.  Spatial models such as autocorrelation statistics, regression and interpolation (see below) can also dictate sample design.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

=== Common errors in spatial analysis ===
The fundamental issues in spatial analysis lead to numerous problems in analysis including bias, distortion and outright errors in the conclusions reached. These issues are often interlinked but various attempts have been made to separate out particular issues from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ocaña-Riola | first1 = R | year = 2010 | title = Common errors in disease mapping | journal = Geospatial Health | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 139–154 | pmid = 20503184 | doi=10.4081/gh.2010.196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Length ====
In a paper by [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] on the [[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|coastline of Britain]] it was shown that it is inherently nonsensical to discuss certain spatial concepts despite an inherent presumption of the validity of the concept. Lengths in ecology depend directly on the scale at which they are measured and experienced. So while surveyors commonly measure the length of a river, this length only has meaning in the context of the relevance of the measuring technique to the question under study.

Image:britain-fractal-coastline-50km.png|Britain measured using a short yardstick
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Locational fallacy ====
The locational fallacy refers to error due to the particular spatial characterization chosen for the elements of study, in particular choice of placement for the spatial presence of the element.

Spatial characterizations may be simplistic or even wrong. Studies of humans often reduce the spatial existence of humans to a single point, for instance their home address. This can easily lead to poor analysis, for example, when considering disease transmission which can happen at work or at school and therefore far from the home.

The spatial characterization may implicitly limit the subject of study. For example, the spatial analysis of crime data has recently become popular but these studies can only describe the particular kinds of crime which can be described spatially. This leads to many maps of assault but not to any maps of embezzlement with political consequences in the conceptualization of crime and the design of policies to address the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Spatial Fallacies|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/sgam/node/214|website=The Learner's Guide to Geospatial Analysis|publisher=Penn State Department of Geography|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Atomic fallacy ====
This describes errors due to treating elements as separate 'atoms' outside of their spatial context. The fallacy is about transferring individual conclusions to spatial units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Integrating scale in remote sensing and GIS |last=Quattrochi |first=Dale A |isbn=9781482218268|oclc=973767077|date=2016-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ecological fallacy ====
The [[ecological fallacy]] describes errors due to performing analyses on aggregate data when trying to reach conclusions on the individual units. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Errors occur in part from spatial aggregation.  For example, a [[pixel]] represents the average surface temperatures within an area.  Ecological fallacy would be to assume that all points within the area have the same temperature. This topic is closely related to the [[modifiable areal unit problem]].

=== Solutions to the fundamental issues ===

==== Geographic space ====
[[File:Manhattan distance.svg|thumb|200px|Manhattan distance versus Euclidean distance: The red, blue, and yellow lines have the same length (12) in both Euclidean and taxicab geometry. In Euclidean geometry, the green line has length 6×{{radic|2}}&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;8.48, and is the unique shortest path. In taxicab geometry, the green line's length is still 12, making it no shorter than any other path shown.]]A mathematical space exists whenever we have a set of observations and quantitative measures of their attributes. For example, we can represent individuals' incomes or years of education within a coordinate system where the location of each individual can be specified with respect to both dimensions. The distance between individuals within this space is a quantitative measure of their differences with respect to income and education. However, in spatial analysis, we are concerned with specific types of mathematical spaces, namely, geographic space. In geographic space, the observations correspond to locations in a spatial measurement framework that capture their proximity in the real world. The locations in a spatial measurement framework often represent locations on the surface of the Earth, but this is not strictly necessary. A spatial measurement framework can also capture proximity with respect to, say, interstellar space or within a biological entity such as a liver. The fundamental tenet is [[Tobler's first law of geography|Tobler's First Law of Geography]]: if the interrelation between entities increases with proximity in the real world, then representation in geographic space and assessment using spatial analysis techniques are appropriate.

The [[Euclidean distance]] between locations often represents their proximity, although this is only one possibility. There are an infinite number of distances in addition to Euclidean that can support quantitative analysis. For example, "Manhattan" (or "[[Taxicab geometry|Taxicab]]") distances where movement is restricted to paths parallel to the axes can be more meaningful than Euclidean distances in urban settings. In addition to distances, other geographic relationships such as connectivity''' (e.g., the existence or degree of shared borders) and direction''' can also influence the relationships among entities. It is also possible to compute minimal cost paths across a cost surface; for example, this can represent proximity among locations when travel must occur across rugged terrain.

== Types of spatial analysis ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Spatial data comes in many varieties and it is not easy to
 arrive at a system of classification that is simultaneously
 exclusive, exhaustive, imaginative, and satisfying.
                             -- G. Upton &amp; B. Fingelton&lt;ref name="Upton+:1985"&gt;Graham J. Upton &amp; Bernard Fingelton: '''Spatial Data Analysis by Example Volume 1: Point Pattern and Quantitative Data''' John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Spatial data analysis ===
Urban and Regional Studies deal with large tables of spatial data obtained from censuses and surveys. It is necessary to simplify the huge amount of detailed information in order to extract the main trends. Multivariable analysis (or [[Factor analysis]], FA) allows a change of variables, transforming the many variables of the census, usually correlated between themselves, into fewer independent "Factors" or "Principal Components" which are, actually, the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvectors]] of the data correlation matrix weighted by the inverse of their eigenvalues. This change of variables has two main advantages:
# Since information is concentrated on the first new factors, it is possible to keep only a few of them while losing only a small amount of information; mapping them produces fewer and more significant maps 
# The factors, actually the eigenvectors, are orthogonal by construction, i.e. not correlated. In most cases, the dominant factor (with the largest eigenvalue) is the Social Component, separating rich and poor in the city. Since factors are not-correlated, other smaller processes than social status, which would have remained hidden otherwise, appear on the second, third, … factors.

Factor analysis depends on measuring distances between observations : the choice of a significant metric is crucial. The Euclidean metric (Principal Component Analysis), the Chi-Square distance (Correspondence Analysis) or the Generalized Mahalanobis distance (Discriminant Analysis ) are among the more widely used.&lt;ref&gt;Harman H H (1960) ''Modern Factor Analysis'', University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; More complicated models, using communalities or rotations have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Rummel R J (1970) ''Applied Factor Analysis''. Evanston, ILL: Northwestern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using multivariate methods in spatial analysis began really in the 1950s (although some examples go back to the beginning of the century) and culminated in the 1970s, with the increasing power and accessibility of computers. Already in 1948, in a seminal publication, two sociologists, Bell and Shevky,&lt;ref&gt;Bell W &amp; E Shevky (1955) ''Social Area Analysis'', Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; had shown that most city populations in the USA and in the world could be represented with three independent factors : 1- the « socio-economic status » opposing rich and poor districts and distributed in sectors running along highways from the city center, 2- the « life cycle », i.e. the age structure of households, distributed in concentric circles, and 3-  « race and ethnicity », identifying patches of migrants located within the city. In 1961, in a groundbreaking study, British geographers used FA to classify British towns.&lt;ref&gt;Moser C A &amp; W Scott (1961) ''British Towns ; A Statistical Study of their Social and Economic Differences'', Oliver &amp; Boyd, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Brian J Berry, at the University of Chicago, and his students made a wide use of the method,&lt;ref&gt;Berry B J &amp; F Horton (1971) ''Geographic Perspectives on Urban Systems'', John Wiley, N-Y.&lt;/ref&gt; applying it to most important cities in the world and exhibiting common social structures.&lt;ref&gt;Berry B J &amp; K B Smith eds (1972) ''City Classification Handbook : Methods and Applications'', John Wiley, N-Y.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The use of Factor Analysis in Geography, made so easy by modern computers, has been very wide but not always very wise.&lt;ref&gt;Ciceri M-F (1974) ''Méthodes d’analyse multivariée dans la géographie anglo-saxonne'', Université de Paris-1 ; free download on http://www-ohp.univ-paris1.fr&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the vectors extracted are determined by the data matrix, it is not possible to compare factors obtained from different censuses. A solution consists in fusing together several census matrices in a unique table which, then, may be analyzed. This, however, assumes that the definition of the variables has not changed over time and produces very large tables, difficult to manage. A better solution, proposed by psychometricians,&lt;ref&gt;Tucker L R (1964) « The extension of Factor Analysis to three-dimensional matrices », in  Frederiksen N &amp; H Gulliksen eds, ''Contributions to Mathematical Psychology'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; groups the data in a « cubic matrix », with three entries (for instance, locations, variables, time periods). A Three-Way Factor Analysis produces then three groups of factors related by a small cubic « core matrix ».&lt;ref&gt;R. Coppi &amp; S. Bolasco, eds. (1989), ''Multiway data analysis'', Elsevier, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt; This method, which exhibits data evolution over time, has not been widely used in geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cant | first1 = R.G. | year = 1971 | title =  Changes in the location of manufacturing in New Zealand 1957-1968: An application of three-mode factor analysis | journal = New Zealand Geographer | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 38–55 | doi=10.1111/j.1745-7939.1971.tb00636.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Los Angeles,&lt;ref&gt;Marchand B (1986) ''The Emergence of Los Angeles, 1940-1970'', Pion Ltd, London&lt;/ref&gt; however, it has exhibited the role, traditionally ignored, of Downtown as an organizing center for the whole city during several decades.

=== Spatial autocorrelation ===
Spatial [[autocorrelation]] statistics measure and analyze the degree of dependency among observations in a geographic space.  Classic spatial autocorrelation statistics include [[Moran's I|Moran's &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;]], [[Geary's C|Geary's &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;]], [[Getis's G|Getis's]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and the [[standard deviational ellipse]]. These statistics require measuring a spatial weights matrix that reflects the intensity of the geographic relationship between observations in a neighborhood, e.g., the distances between neighbors, the lengths of shared border, or whether they fall into a specified directional class such as "west". Classic spatial autocorrelation statistics compare the spatial weights to the covariance relationship at pairs of locations. Spatial autocorrelation that is more positive than expected from random indicate the clustering of similar values across geographic space, while significant negative spatial autocorrelation indicates that neighboring values are more dissimilar than expected by chance, suggesting a spatial pattern similar to a chess board.

Spatial autocorrelation statistics such as Moran's &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and Geary's &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are global in the sense that they estimate the overall degree of spatial autocorrelation for a dataset.  The possibility of spatial heterogeneity suggests that the estimated degree of autocorrelation may vary significantly across geographic space. '''Local spatial autocorrelation statistics''' provide estimates disaggregated to the level of the spatial analysis units, allowing assessment of the dependency relationships across space. &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; statistics compare neighborhoods to a global average and identify local regions of strong autocorrelation.  Local versions of the &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; statistics are also available.

=== Spatial stratified heterogeneity ===
Spatial stratified heterogeneity, referring to the within-strata variance less than the between strata-variance, is ubiquitous in ecological phenomena, such as ecological zones and many ecological variables.  Spatial stratified heterogeneity of an attribute can be measured by geographical detector ''q''-statistic:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = JF | last2 = Zhang | first2 = TL | last3 = Fu | first3 = BJ | year = 2016 | title = A measure of spatial stratified heterogeneity | journal = Ecological Indicators | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 250–256 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.02.052}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                              &lt;math&gt; q = 1 - \frac{1}{N\sigma^2}\sum_{h=1}^LN_h\sigma_h^2  &lt;/math&gt;
where a population is partitioned into ''h'' = 1, ..., ''L'' strata; ''N'' stands for the size of the population, σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; stands for variance of the attribute. The value of ''q'' is within [0, 1], 0 indicates no spatial stratified heterogeneity, 1 indicates perfect spatial stratified heterogeneity.The value of ''q'' indicates the percent of the variance of an attribute explained by the stratification.The ''q'' follows a noncentral ''F'' probability density function.

=== Spatial interpolation ===
[[Spatial interpolation]] methods estimate the variables at unobserved locations in geographic space based on the values at observed locations.  Basic methods include [[inverse distance weighting]]: this attenuates the variable with decreasing proximity from the observed location.  [[Kriging]] is a more sophisticated method that interpolates across space according to a spatial lag relationship that has both systematic and random components.  This can accommodate a wide range of spatial relationships for the hidden values between observed locations.  Kriging provides optimal estimates given the hypothesized lag relationship, and error estimates can be mapped to determine if spatial patterns exist.

=== Spatial regression ===
{{See also|Local regression|Regression-Kriging}}

Spatial regression methods capture spatial dependency in [[regression analysis]], avoiding statistical problems such as unstable parameters and unreliable significance tests, as well as providing information on spatial relationships among the variables involved.  The estimated spatial relationships can be used on spatial and spatio-temporal predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Song|first=Yongze|author2=Yong Ge|title=Spatial distribution estimation of malaria in northern China and its scenarios in 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050|journal=Malaria Journal|volume=15|issue=1|pages=345|doi=10.1186/s12936-016-1395-2|pmid=27387921|pmc=4936159|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the specific technique, spatial dependency can enter the regression model as relationships between the independent variables and the dependent, between the dependent variables and a spatial lag of itself, or in the error terms.  '''Geographically weighted regression''' (GWR) is a local version of spatial regression that generates parameters disaggregated by the spatial units of analysis.&lt;ref name="Fotheringham1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fotheringham | first1 = A.

=== Spatial interaction ===
Spatial interaction or "[[gravity model]]s" estimate the flow of people, material or information between locations in geographic space.  Factors can include origin propulsive variables such as the number of commuters in residential areas, destination attractiveness variables such as the amount of office space in employment areas, and proximity relationships between the locations measured in terms such as driving distance or travel time.  In addition, the topological, or [[Geospatial topology|connective]], relationships between areas must be identified, particularly considering the often conflicting relationship between distance and topology; for example, two spatially close neighborhoods may not display any significant interaction if they are separated by a highway. After specifying the functional forms of these relationships, the analyst can estimate model parameters using observed flow data and standard estimation techniques such as ordinary least squares or maximum likelihood. Competing destinations versions of spatial interaction models include the proximity among the destinations (or origins) in addition to the origin-destination proximity; this captures the effects of destination (origin) clustering on flows. Computational methods such as [[artificial neural networks]] can also estimate spatial interaction relationships among locations and can handle noisy and qualitative data.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

=== Simulation and modeling ===
Spatial interaction models are aggregate and top-down: they specify an overall governing relationship for flow between locations.  This characteristic is also shared by urban models such as those based on mathematical programming, flows among economic sectors, or bid-rent theory.  An alternative modeling perspective is to represent the system at the highest possible level of disaggregation and study the bottom-up emergence of complex patterns and relationships from behavior and interactions at the individual level. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

[[Complex adaptive systems]] theory as applied to spatial analysis suggests that simple interactions among proximal entities can lead to intricate, persistent and functional spatial entities at aggregate levels.  Two fundamentally spatial simulation methods are cellular automata and agent-based modeling. [[Cellular automata]] modeling imposes a fixed spatial framework such as grid cells and specifies rules that dictate the state of a cell based on the states of its neighboring cells.  As time progresses, spatial patterns emerge as cells change states based on their neighbors; this alters the conditions for future time periods.  For example, cells can represent locations in an urban area and their states can be different types of land use.  Patterns that can emerge from the simple interactions of local land uses include office districts and urban sprawl. [[Agent-based model]]ing uses software entities (agents) that have purposeful behavior (goals) and can react, interact and modify their environment while seeking their objectives.  Unlike the cells in cellular automata, simulysts can allow agents to be mobile with respect to space.  For example, one could model traffic flow and dynamics using agents representing individual vehicles that try to minimize travel time between specified origins and destinations.  While pursuing minimal travel times, the agents must avoid collisions with other vehicles also seeking to minimize their travel times.  Cellular automata and agent-based modeling are complementary modeling strategies.  They can be integrated into a common geographic automata system where some agents are fixed while others are mobile.

Calibration plays a pivotal role in both CA and ABM simulation and modelling approaches. Initial approaches to CA proposed robust calibration approaches based on stochastic, Monte Carlo methods.&lt;ref name="Silva"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silva|first1=E.

=== Multiple-point geostatistics (MPS) ===
Spatial analysis of a conceptual geological model is the main purpose of any MPS algorithm. The method analyzes the spatial statistics of the geological model, called the training image, and generates realizations of the phenomena that honor those input multiple-point statistics.

A recent MPS algorithm used to accomplish this task is the pattern-based method by Honarkhah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Honarkhah | first1 = M | last2 = Caers | first2 = J | year = 2010 | title = Stochastic Simulation of Patterns Using Distance-Based Pattern Modeling | doi = 10.1007/s11004-010-9276-7 | journal = Mathematical Geosciences | volume = 42 | issue = 5| pages = 487–517 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this method, a distance-based approach is employed to analyze the patterns in the training image. This allows the reproduction of the multiple-point statistics, and the complex geometrical features of the training image. Each output of the MPS algorithm is a realization that represents a random field. Together, several realizations may be used to quantify spatial uncertainty.

One of the recent methods is presented by Tahmasebi et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tahmasebi | first1 = P. | last2 = Hezarkhani | first2 = A. | last3 = Sahimi | first3 = M. | year = 2012 | title = Multiple-point geostatistical modeling based on the cross-correlation functions | journal = Computational Geosciences | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 779–79742 | doi=10.1007/s10596-012-9287-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses a cross-correlation function to improve the spatial pattern reproduction. They call their MPS simulation method as the CCSIM algorithm. This method is able to quantify the spatial connectivity, variability and uncertainty. Furthermore, the method is not sensitive to any type of data and is able to simulate both categorical and continuous scenarios. CCSIM algorithm is able to be used for any stationary, non-stationary and multivariate systems and it can provide high quality visual appeal model.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tahmasebi |first=P. |last2=Sahimi |first2=M. |year=2015 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.91.032401 |pmid=25871117 |title=Reconstruction of nonstationary disordered materials and media: Watershed transform and cross-correlation function |journal=Physical Review E |volume=91 |issue=3|pages=032401 |bibcode=2015PhRvE..91c2401T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tahmasebi |first=P. |last2=Sahimi |first2=M. |year=2015 |title=Geostatistical Simulation and Reconstruction of Porous Media by a Cross-Correlation Function and Integration of Hard and Soft Data |doi=10.1007/s11242-015-0471-3 |journal=Transport in Porous Media |volume=107 |issue=3| pages=871–905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geographical information system usage ===
[[Geographic information system]]s (GIS) — a large domain that provides a variety of capabilities designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of geographical data — utilizes geospatial analysis in a variety of contexts, operations and applications.

==== Basic applications ====
Geospatial analysis, using [[GIS]], was developed for problems in the environmental and life sciences, in particular [[ecology]], [[geology]] and [[epidemiology]]. It has extended to almost all industries including defense, intelligence, utilities, Natural Resources (i.e. Oil and Gas, Forestry ... etc.), social sciences, medicine and [[Public Safety]] (i.e. emergency management and criminology), disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM), and climate change adaptation (CCA). Spatial statistics typically result primarily from observation rather than experimentation.

==== Basic operations ====
Vector-based [[GIS]] is typically related to operations such as map overlay (combining two or more maps or map layers according to predefined rules), simple buffering (identifying regions of a map within a specified distance of one or more features, such as towns, roads or rivers) and similar basic operations. This reflects (and is reflected in) the use of the term spatial analysis within the Open Geospatial Consortium ([[Open Geospatial Consortium|OGC]]) “simple feature specifications”. For raster-based GIS, widely used in the environmental sciences and remote sensing, this typically means a range of actions applied to the grid cells of one or more maps (or images) often involving filtering and/or algebraic operations (map algebra). These techniques involve processing one or more raster layers according to simple rules resulting in a new map layer, for example replacing each cell value with some combination of its neighbours’ values, or computing the sum or difference of specific attribute values for each grid cell in two matching raster datasets. Descriptive statistics, such as cell counts, means, variances, maxima, minima, cumulative values, frequencies and a number of other measures and distance computations are also often included in this generic term [[spatial analysis]]. Spatial analysis includes a large variety of statistical techniques (descriptive, [[Exploratory data analysis|exploratory]], and explanatory [[statistics]]) that apply to data that vary spatially and which can vary over time. Some more advanced statistical techniques include Getis-ord Gi* or Anselin Local Moran's I which are used to determine clustering patterns of spatially referenced data.

==== Advanced operations ====
Geospatial analysis goes beyond 2D and 3D mapping operations and spatial statistics. It includes: 
* Surface analysis — in particular analysing the properties of physical surfaces, such as [[gradient]], [[aspect (geography)|aspect]] and [[visibility]], and analysing surface-like data “fields”;
* Network analysis — examining the properties of natural and man-made networks in order to understand the behaviour of flows within and around such networks; and locational analysis. GIS-based network analysis may be used to address a wide range of practical problems such as route selection and facility location (core topics in the field of [[operations research]], and problems involving flows such as those found in [[hydrology]] and transportation research. In many instances location problems relate to networks and as such are addressed with tools designed for this purpose, but in others existing networks may have little or no relevance or may be impractical to incorporate within the modeling process. Problems that are not specifically network constrained, such as new road or pipeline routing, regional warehouse location, mobile phone mast positioning or the selection of rural community health care sites, may be effectively analysed (at least initially) without reference to existing physical networks. Locational analysis "in the plane" is also applicable where suitable network datasets are not available, or are too large or expensive to be utilised, or where the location algorithm is very complex or involves the examination or simulation of a very large number of alternative configurations.
* [[Geovisualization]] — the creation and manipulation of images, maps, diagrams, charts, 3D views and their associated tabular datasets. GIS packages increasingly provide a range of such tools, providing static or rotating views, draping images over 2.5D surface representations, providing animations and fly-throughs, dynamic linking and brushing and spatio-temporal visualisations. This latter class of tools is the least developed, reflecting in part the limited range of suitable compatible datasets and the limited set of analytical methods available, although this picture is changing rapidly. All these facilities augment the core tools utilised in spatial analysis throughout the analytical process (exploration of data, identification of patterns and relationships, construction of models, and communication of results)

==== Mobile Geospatial Computing ====
Traditionally geospatial computing has been performed primarily on personal computers (PCs) or servers. Due to the increasing capabilities of mobile devices, however, geospatial computing in mobile devices is a fast-growing trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chen|first1=Ruizhi|last2=Guinness|first2=Robert E.|title=Geospatial Computing in Mobile Devices|date=2014|publisher=Artech House|location=Norwood, MA|isbn=978-1-60807-565-2|pages=228|edition=1st|url=http://www.artechhouse.com/International/Books/Geospatial-Computing-in-Mobile-Devices-2159.aspx|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portable nature of these devices, as well as the presence of useful sensors, such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers and barometric pressure sensors, make them useful for capturing and processing geospatial information in the field. In addition to the local processing of geospatial information on mobile devices, another growing trend is cloud-based geospatial computing. In this architecture, data can be collected in the field using mobile devices and then transmitted to cloud-based servers for further processing and ultimate storage. In a similar manner, geospatial information can be made available to connected mobile devices via the cloud, allowing access to vast databases of geospatial information anywhere where a wireless data connection is available.

=== Geographic information science and spatial analysis ===
{{further information|Geographic information systems#Spatial analysis}}
'''[[Geographic information systems]]''' (GIS) and the underlying [[geographic information science]] that advances these technologies have a strong influence on spatial analysis.  The increasing ability to capture and handle geographic data means that spatial analysis is occurring within increasingly data-rich environments.  Geographic data capture systems include remotely sensed imagery, environmental monitoring systems such as intelligent transportation systems, and location-aware technologies such as mobile devices that can report location in near-real time.  GIS provide platforms for managing these data, computing spatial relationships such as distance, connectivity and directional relationships between spatial units, and visualizing both the raw data and spatial analytic results within a cartographic context.
[[Image:Minard.png|thumb|300px|This flow map of Napoleon's ill-fated march on Moscow is an early and celebrated example of geovisualization. It shows the army's direction as it traveled, the places the troops passed through, the size of the army as troops died from hunger and wounds, and the freezing temperatures they experienced.]]

==== Content ====
*Spatial location: Transfer positioning information of space objects with the help of space coordinate system. Projection transformation theory is the foundation of spatial object representation.
*Spatial distribution: the similar spatial object groups positioning information, including distribution, trends, contrast etc..
*Spatial form: the geometric shape of the spatial objects
*Spatial space: the space objects' approaching degree
*Spatial relationship: relationship between spatial objects, including topological, orientation, similarity, etc..

'''[[Geovisualization]]''' (GVis) combines scientific visualization with [[digital cartography]] to support the exploration and analysis of geographic data and information, including the results of spatial analysis or simulation. GVis leverages the human orientation towards visual information processing in the exploration, analysis and communication of geographic data and information.  In contrast with traditional cartography, GVis is typically three- or four-dimensional (the latter including time) and user-interactive.

'''Geographic knowledge discovery''' (GKD) is the human-centered process of applying efficient computational tools for exploring massive [[spatial database]]s. GKD includes geographic [[data mining]], but also encompasses related activities such as data selection, data cleaning and pre-processing, and interpretation of results. GVis can also serve a central role in the GKD process.  GKD is based on the premise that massive databases contain interesting (valid, novel, useful and understandable) patterns that standard analytical techniques cannot find.  GKD can serve as a hypothesis-generating process for spatial analysis, producing tentative patterns and relationships that should be confirmed using spatial analytical techniques.

'''[[Spatial decision support system]]s''' (SDSS) take existing spatial data and use a variety of mathematical models to make projections into the future. This allows urban and regional planners to test intervention decisions prior to implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=González|first=Ainhoa|last2=Donnelly|first2=Alison|last3=Jones|first3=Mike|last4=Chrysoulakis|first4=Nektarios|last5=Lopes|first5=Myriam|year=2012|title=A decision-support system for sustainable urban metabolism in Europe|doi=10.1016/j.eiar.2012.06.007|journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review|volume=38|pages=109–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ClassCanalStreetNewOrleans.jpg|thumb|240px|According to the spatial mismatch theory, opportunities for low-income people are located far away from where they live.]]'''Spatial mismatch''' is the mismatch between where low-income households reside and suitable job opportunities. In its original formulation (see below) and in subsequent research, it has mostly been understood as a phenomenon affecting African-Americans, as a result of [[Racial segregation in the United States|residential segregation]], [[economic restructuring]], and the suburbanization of employment.

Spatial mismatch was first proposed by [[John F. Kain]] in a seminal 1968 article, "Housing Segregation, Negro Employment, and Metropolitan Decentralization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John F. |last=Kain |title=Housing Segregation, Negro Employment, and Metropolitan Decentralization |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |year=1968 |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=175–197 |doi=10.2307/1885893 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That article did not specifically use the term "spatial mismatch", and Kain disclaimed credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John F. |last=Kain |title=A pioneer's perspective on the spatial mismatch literature |journal=[[Urban Studies (journal)|Urban Studies]] |year=2004 |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=7–32 |doi=10.1080/0042098032000155669}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1987, [[William Julius Wilson]] was an important exponent, elaborating the role of economic restructuring, as well as the departure of the black middle-class, in the development of a ghetto underclass in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=William Julius |title=The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, the Underclass, and Public Policy |year=1987 |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-90130-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Ingram Park Mall1.JPG|thumb|240px|Suburban shopping malls took employment out of the inner city.]]
After [[World War I]], many wealthy Americans started decentralizing out of the cities and into the suburbs. During the second half of the 20th century, [[department store]]s followed the trend of moving into the suburbs. In 1968, Kain formulated the “Spatial Mismatch Hypothesis”, but he did not refer to it by this term. His hypothesis was that black workers reside in segregated zones that are distant and poorly connected to major centers of growth. The phenomenon has many implications for inner-city residents dependent on low-level entry jobs. For example, distance from work centers can lead to increasing unemployment rates and further dampen poverty outcomes for the region at large.

==Factors==
In 2007, Laurent Gobillon, Harris Selod, and Yves Zenou suggested that there are seven different factors that support the spatial mismatch phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gobillon |first=Laurent |last2=Selod |first2=Harris |last3=Zenou |first3=Yves |year=2007 |title=The Mechanisms of Spatial Mismatch |journal=Urban Studies |volume=44 |issue=12 |pages=2401–2427 |doi=10.1080/00420980701540937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Four factors are attributed to potential workers accessibility and initiatives. The remaining three factors stress employers' reluctance to divert away from the negative stigma of city people and in particular minorities when hiring.
	
===Potential workers perspectives===
[[Image:Pruitt-igoeUSGS02.jpg|thumb|240px|Urban redevelopment projects such as [[Pruitt–Igoe]] in St. Louis concentrated and separated workers from their surroundings and work. Such projects created a ghettoized underclass in America.]]
*Commuting cost is seen as an obstacle for inner city people to be present for job interviews and furthermore to arrive to work everyday on time. In other words, cars may be too expensive for some workers and they may have to rely heavily on public transportation. Public transportation is problematic in a sense that it is not always prompt and may not stop at all job location sites.
*Information access to jobs decreases as distance increases away from the job center. People who are living away from the job center are generally less knowledgeable about potential openings than individuals who live closer to the job center. Therefore, networking and [[knowledge spillover|information spillovers]] are of a major advantage in accessing information about potential openings.
*There seems to be a lack of incentive for distance workers to search intensively for a job that is relatively far away. Gobillion, Selod and Zenou believe that minorities, more or less, do a tradeoff between short term loss and long term benefits. The short term loss involves making frequent search trips to distant work centers. However, the long term benefit involves obtaining a stable job and thus a higher wage rate. Unfortunately, minorities tend to weigh the short term loss higher than the long term benefits and as a result decreases their opportunity at obtaining a job in the suburbs.
*There also seems to be a high search cost involve for urban workers looking for a job in the suburbs. It might be associated with paying a job agency to expand their search beyond the urban residential area or locating an agency in the suburbs.

==China==
Growth of [[List of under-occupied developments in China|ghost cities in China]], mostly from not yet agglomerated areas between or adjacent metropolitan areas or coal mining towns, as in the case of the most famous example, [[Kangbashi New Area]] of [[Ordos (city)|Ordos]], are an example of spatial mismatch.  In the case of places near metropolitan areas, it represents less of a risk going forward than in mining areas.

'''Tellagraf''' is an early software package designed to allow end-users to "turn out full color, professional quality charts" with initial results displayed on a screen, modified as needed, and then "a final 'hard-copy' can be made .. or made into 35mm color transparencies for projection onto a screen."

Users of Tellagraf often had access to '''CueChart''' and '''Disspla''' software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3504">'''The Best in Heritage''' is an international, annual survey of award-winning [[museum]], [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] and [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] projects. The survey was launched in 2003 by the European Heritage Association from [[Zagreb]] under leadership from professor [[Tomislav S. Šola]]. The event is being held every year in the city of [[Dubrovnik]], [[Croatia]] at the end of September. The aim of the conference is to give prize winning projects from the preceding year further professional and media attention. The event serves to identify and promote the best museum, heritage and conservation projects in the world. 

== The event ==
''The Best in Heritage'' is an annual presentation of awarded museum, heritage, and conservation projects. Over 40 hand-picked projects and institutions which have received national or international awards in the previous year are presented by their authors or institution directors, followed by discussions, exhibitions and receptions. Presenters explain why their achievements were proclaimed the best in the previous year and received an award. The aim is to present quality projects in anything concerning the care and communication of heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://europa.eu/cultural-heritage/international-conference-best-heritage-2018_en |title=The "Best in Heritage" |publisher=europa.eu |date=2018-03-15 |accessdate=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''IMAGINES'' ==
At the ''IMAGINES'' event New technologies and Multimedia projects are being presented in a one-day programme. 

== Patronage ==
The conference is organised in partnership with [[Europa Nostra]]. The main patron is the [[ICOM Fund]] of the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM)&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.ne-mo.org/reading-corner/cultural-tourism.html|title=The Best in Heritage: Projects of Influence (14th Edition)|publisher=''Ne-Mo.org''}}&lt;/ref&gt;, other patrons are: [[ICOMOS]], [[ICCROM]], [[International Federation of Library Associations]], the City of [[Dubrovnik]] and the [[Ministry of Culture (Croatia)|Croatian Ministry of Culture]]. The Museums of Dubrovnik are local partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebestinheritage.com/event/sponsors/ |title=Sponsors, Patrons, Supporters |publisher=The Best in Heritage |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects of Influence ==
From 2015 onward, the conference audience, together with moderators and last year's winners, votes for the "Project of influence" award for each of the two events, winners of which are announced at the closing ceremony.

[[Michael Nyman]] created a companion album of the same title in 1999.  The second disc of the two-disc album contains ''The Fall of Icarus'', the score to an eponymous [[art installation]] by [[Peter Greenaway]] from [[1986 in art|1986]] which had previously been unreleased.  The first disc, ''The Commissar Vanishes'', is a version of ''The Fall of Icarus'' that has been defaced similarly to the photographs reproduced in King's book.

'''World Charter for Nature''' was adopted by [[United Nations]] member nation-states on October 28, 1982. It proclaims five "principles of conservation by which all human conduct affecting nature is to be guided and judged."

# Nature shall be respected and its essential processes shall not be impaired. 
# The genetic viability on the earth shall not be compromised; the population levels of all life forms, wild and domesticated, must be at least sufficient for their survival, and to this end necessary habitats shall be safeguarded.
# All areas of the earth, both land and sea, shall be subject to these principles of conservation; special protection shall be given to unique areas, to representative samples of all the different types of ecosystems and to the habitats of rare or endangered species.
# Ecosystems and organisms, as well as the land, marine and atmospheric resources that are utilized by man, shall be managed to achieve and maintain optimum sustainable productivity, but not in such a way as to endanger the integrity of those other ecosystems or species with which they coexist. 
# Nature shall be secured against degradation caused by warfare or other hostile activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Charter for Nature|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/37/a37r007.htm|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=25 August 2013|author=United Nations General Assembly|date=28 October 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vote was 111 for, one against ([[United States]]), 18 abstentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = International Environmental Standards Handbook | author = Scott S. Olson | isbn = 1-56670-270-4 | year = 1999 | pages = 39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6367">'''Zhuang studies''' (or Zhuangology; [[Standard Zhuang]]: Cuenghhag; {{zh|t=壯學|s=壮学|p=Zhuàngxué}})  is an [[interdisciplinary]] intellectual field concerned with the [[Zhuang people]]&amp;nbsp;– their history, anthropology, religion, politics, [[Zhuang languages|languages]], and literature. The majority of such research is being carried out in the [[People's Republic of China]]. [[Huang Xianfan]] (黄现璠) is considered by many to be the father of Zhuang studies.&lt;ref&gt;Mo jun:《A Master of Zhuang Studies》.Guangxi's daily, on 3 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Areas commonly included under this rubric include [[history]] of Zhuang, [[literature]] of Zhuang, [[art]] of Zhuang, [[music]] of Zhuang, [[language]] of Zhuang, [[sociology]] of Zhuang, political science of Zhuang, [[economics]] of Zhuang, [[folklore]] of Zhuang, and ethnomusicology of Zhuang. It may be compared to other ethnic groups studies disciplines, such as Tai studies and Yao studies. Zhuang studies is sometimes included within a broader regional area of focus including: "[[Lingnan]] studies", "[[Baiyue|Yue people]] studies","[[South Asia]] studies", or "[[ASEAN]] Studies".

==History==
Zhuang studies is a relatively new discipline.

Huang Xianfan may be considered as the first Zhuangologist and he did much to make Zhuang known in China. Since 1950, Huang Xianfan led the group making a largest and deepest investigation on ethnic history and traditional [[culture]] in [[Guangxi]] history. They had collected a lot of valuable materials and laid a foundation for further research on Zhuang ethnic social and historical culture.That was a very important beginning for later development of Zhuang ethnic research and establishment of Guangxi institute of ethnic studies. Therefore, the inception of Zhuang studies as an authentic academic discipline is thus associated with the  first  ethnologist Huang Xianfan de Zhuang who is considered as its founder to present day,&lt;ref&gt;Mo jun:《A Master of Zhuang Studies》.Guangxi's daily, on 3 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; the other early zhuang studies of note being Huang Zengqing ([[Huang group]]'s member and the first archaeological researcher of the Guangxi) who in 1957 occupied the first chair for Zhuang's  [[archaeology]] studies in China and Zhou Zuoqiou, who was primarily the pioneering subject of the zhuang literature in [[Guangxi Normal University]].

The [[Huang group|Bagui School]] (The first ethnic school in [[China]] and pioneer is [[Huang Xianfan]]) was particularly significant for the development of the discipline since the early 1950s with Huang Xianfan, Huang Zengqing, Ban Xiouwen, Ou Yang Ruoxiou, Qin Cailuan, Qin Naichang, Qin Shengmin, He Longqun, Yu Shijie, Qin Deqing, Pan Qixu, Huang Hanjin and Zeng Chaoxiong.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTOTAL-HSKX200808010.htm Chen Ji Sheng:《On Bagui School of Chinese Ethnology》, Guangxi Social Sciences，7th–11th Issues，2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc88.com/p-405985601120.html  Chen Ji Sheng:《On Bagui School of Chinese Ethnology]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, the Guangxi government established the Guangxi institute of ethnic studies to promote Zhuang studies around China. In 1991 the Guangxi Zhuang Studies Society was established, and in April 1999 the first international Zhuang studies conference was held in Wuming with scholars from 8 different countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTotal-MZYJ903.012.htm 郭爱民  :《壮学首届国际学术研讨会综述》, 《民族研究》 1999年03期]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the last few decades in other countries the studies of the Zhuang have opened towards other disciplines, resulting in works with interdisciplinary approach. As examples of such open-minded Zhuang researcher we might mention the [[United States|American]] anthropologist Jeffrey Barlow, among others, who has done noted research and publications on lexical questions, about Zhuang culture  and the modern history of Zhuang. Others are [[Japanese people|Japanese]] anthropologist Chikada Sigeyuki, [[Australian]] anthropologist David Holm, and many more.

Note: This book is written in English by Professor Jin Li of [[Guangxi University for Nationalities]]. It is addressed to two groups of readers for two different purposes. First, it is hoped that Chinese students whose majors are related to Zhuang studies would by reading this book be exposed to academic writing in English on relevant subjects. Second, it may be beneficial to English-speaking people who have an interest in the Zhuang, their history and their culture.
