'''Aging''' is a process by which an [[Work of art|art]]work, typically a [[painting]] or [[sculpture]], is made to appear old. It is meant to emulate the natural deterioration that can occur over many decades or centuries.

Paintings deteriorate over time because they are created using essentially incompatible materials, with each having a different reaction to the changes in the environment, including light, temperature and [[relative humidity]].

An oil painting consists of several layers, comprising the base [[canvas]], a layer of [[gesso]] base coat, several layers of the [[oil paint|oil-based paint]] and then several coats of [[varnish]] to protect the paint surface. With many different materials, it is understandable that each layer may dry at different rates and will also absorb and release moisture at different rates. When this occurs, expansion and contraction of the painting will result in a crazing of the varnish surface. This pattern of small cracks is known as [[craquelure]]. Along with the darkening or yellowing of the varnish surface, it is this visual representation of the cracking that is typically the primary indicator of ageing.

The purpose for artificially ageing is to create a finished product that accurately reflects an era or is consistent with the environment (usually period) into which it is to be placed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3569">'''Alkaline lysis''' or '''alkaline extraction''' is a method used in [[molecular biology]] to [[Plasmid preparation|isolate plasmid DNA]] from bacteria.

==Method==
Bacteria containing the [[plasmid]] of interest are first [[Cell culture|cultured]], then a sample is [[Centrifugation|centrifuged]] in order to concentrate cellular material (including [[DNA]]) into a pellet at the bottom of the containing vessel. The supernatant is discarded, and the pellet is then re-suspended in an [[EDTA]]-containing physiological [[Buffer solution|buffer]]. The purpose of the EDTA is to chelate divalent metal cations such as [[Magnesium|Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[Calcium|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]], which are required for the function of DNA degrading enzymes ([[Deoxyribonuclease|DNAses]]) and also serve to de-stabilise the DNA phosphate backbone and cell wall. Glucose in the buffer will maintain the osmotic pressure of the cell in order to prevent the cell from bursting. Tris in the buffer will retain the pH of the cell with 8.0 and RNase will remove the RNA which will disrupt the experiment.

Separately, a strong [[alkaline]] solution consisting of the detergent [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] (SDS) and a strong base such as [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH) is prepared and then added. The resulting mixture is incubated for a few minutes. During this time, the detergent disrupts cell membranes and allows the alkali to contact and denature both [[Circular bacterial chromosome|chromosomal]] and plasmid DNA.
One thing which should be noted is that, after tearing apart the cell membrane by SDS, the cell content will neutralize the NaOH; this is why the pH of the lysis goes down from 12.8 to 12.3. So if there are not enough bacterial cells, the extra NaOH will function to generate small DNA fragment. But 0.5 M L-arginine, which can supply a stable pH, can be used to replace 0.1 M sodium hydroxide.&lt;ref&gt;{Cloninger, 2008 #100}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, [[potassium acetate]] is added. This acidifies the solution and allows the renaturing of plasmid DNA, but not chromosomal DNA, which is precipitated out of solution. Another function of the potassium is to cause the precipitation of [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] and thus removal of the detergent. A final centrifugation is carried out, and this time the pellet contains only debris and can be discarded. The plasmid-containing supernatant is carefully removed and can be further purified or used for analysis, such as [[Agarose gel electrophoresis|gel electrophoresis]].

==Other Uses==
Also, alkaline lysis is sometimes used to extract plant genetic material.  The plant cells are subjected to a strongly alkaline solution containing a detergent (usually a [[zwitterion]]ic or [[nonionic]] [[detergent]] such as [[polysorbate 20|Tween 20]]), and the mixture is incubated at high temperature.  This method is not used as often due to the sodium hydroxide's tendency to damage genetic material, reducing DNA fragment size.

'''''Applied Drama''''', also known as '''''Applied Theatre, Interactive Theatre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sant|first=Toni|title=The Applied and Interactive Theatre Guide|date=22 Sep 2006|url=http://www.interactiveimprov.com/aitg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''or '''Applied Drama''' '''and Theatre (ADT)''''' is an [[umbrella term]] for the use of [[drama]] practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Phillip|title=Applied Theatre/Drama: an e-debate in 2004|journal=Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance J|date=February 2006|volume=11|issue=1|pages=90–95|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13569780500437960#.UZmDvSsa-nk|doi=10.1080/13569780500437960}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often done in non-theatrical spaces, with participants who do not consider themselves to be artists.

There are several forms and practices considered to be under the umbrella of Applied Drama. In all these fields approaches and methods of [[Applied improvisation|Applied Improvisation]] are used. 

==History and definition==
Applied Drama is a term that has been contested{{By whom|date=August 2015}}, gaining popularity towards the end of the 20th century to describe drama practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context.

James Thompson states that "Applied theatre is a participatory theatre created by people who would not usually make theatre. It is, I would hope, a practice by, with and for the excluded and marginalised." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Applied Theatre: Bewilderment and Beyond|last = Thompson|first = James|publisher = Peter Lang|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Ackyroyd confirms the inclusion of both of these elements in ADT: "I have identified two features which I believe to be central to our understanding of applied theatre; an intention to generate change (of awareness, attitude, behaviour, etc), and the participation of the audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Applied Theatre: Problems and Possibilities|last = Ackroyd|first = Judith|date = 2000|journal = Applied Theatre Researcher|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied drama can be either scripted or unscripted.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|quote = |title = Applied Theatre, International Case Studies and Challenges for Practice|year = 2009|publisher = Intellect Publishers|location = Briston, UK|page = 7|editor1=Monica Prendergast |editor2=Juliana Saxton }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some practitioners focus primarily on improvisation, whereas others  introduce a range of artistic practices, such as developing scripted plays,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleanbreak.org.uk retrieved 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; devised performances,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oilycart.org.uk.retrieved{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; or indigenous forms of cultural performance, sometimes combined with new forms of digital communication.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example www.charles-royal.com, www.africanperformers.com, www.storyworkshop.org. retrieved 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields associated with applied drama==

===Playback Theatre===
{{Main|Playback Theatre}}
[[Playback Theatre]] involves audience or group members telling stories from their lives and viewing them as enacted by actors improvising. It can also be used in conjunction with [[Narrative Therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Playback theatre and narrative therapy: introducing a new model|journal=Dramatherapy |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=108–119 |quote=Article elaborates how such integration (Playback theatre with Narrative Therapy) can be achieved and how it can contribute to the process of narrative re-authoring.|doi=10.1080/02630672.2013.821865|year=2013|last1=Barak|first1=Adi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama in Health Education===
Drama in healthcare is drama created in medical contexts, often with the intention of rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Bernie|title=Using the Creative Arts in Therapy and Healthcare: A Practical Introduction|publisher=Routledge|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of Applied Drama focuses on using theatre to educate, engage, and stimulate healing in medical professionals, patients, and the general public. Theatre and drama in healthcare are tilted towards conscientizing the populace about their health and improving their health and longevity irrespective of status or social stratification. This form of drama is often used to educate people on important health issues such as healthy eating, grief and loss, exercise, and sexual assault prevention. Examples include using actors to [[Role-playing|role-play]] health ailments in order to train healthcare professionals, performing plays focused on [[Preventive healthcare|primary prevention]], and facilitating drama workshops for patients.

===Drama Therapy===
{{Main|Drama therapy}}
[[Drama therapy]] is the use of Applied Drama techniques to facilitate personal growth and promote mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Loretta Gallo-Lopez, Lawrence C. C. Rubin -Play-Based Interventions for Children and Adolescents on the ...  2012- Page 100 "An overview of drama therapy is provided next, along with support for the use of drama therapy with children with ASd."&lt;/ref&gt;

Drama therapy is rooted in a clinical practice, facilitated by licensed clinicians, that stimulates language, cognitive development and builds resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Clinical Applications of Drama Therapy in Child and Adolescent Treatment|last = Weber|first = Anna Marie|publisher = Brunner-Routledge|year = 2005|isbn = |location = New York|pages = |last2 = Haen|first2 = Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre for Development===
{{Main|Theatre for Development}}
Theatre for Development uses Applied Drama techniques to facilitate development in [[less developed countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kabaso|first=Sydney|title=Theater for Development in Zambia|year=2013|publisher=Kabsy Digital Media|location=Zambia|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama in Education ===
{{Confusing section|date=August 2015}}
Drama in Education can allow students to develop an understanding of themselves and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arts, The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 1-8|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/elementary/arts18curr.pdf|publisher=Ontario Ministry of Education and Training|accessdate=20 May 2013|page=5|quote=Education in the arts is essential to students’ intellectual, social, physical, and emotional growth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathleen Galllagher has argued that 'What is clear is that there is no correct pedagogical model on offer for drama education. [...] In theatre pedagogy, we not only endow experience with meaning, but we are - as players - invited to make manifest our own subjectivities in the world evoked through character and play, a world laden with metaphor and nuance, a world where relationship to other and self-spectatorship are in dynamic and unrelenting interaction.'&lt;ref&gt;See 'Emergent Conceptions in Theatre Pedagogy and Production' in  ''How Theatre Education: Convergences and Counterpoints'' 3-13, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre in Education===
{{Main|Theatre in education}}
{{Overly detailed|date=August 2015|section=yes}}
Theatre in education (TIE) originated in Britain in the mid-1960s. Monica Prendergast and Juliana Saxton cite TIE as "one of the two historic roots of applied theatre practice."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; TIE typically includes a theatre company performing in an educational setting (i.e. a school) for youth, including interactive and performative moments.

Practitioner Lynn Hoare defines TIE as a combination of "theatrical elements with interactive moments in which audience participants (in or out of role) work with actor-teachers towards an educational or social goal, using the tools of theatre in service of this goal."&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, Lynn. Considering the Form: Fundamental Factors in Devising for Theatre-In-Education. Thesis. University of Texas at Austin. n.p. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Helen Nicholson notes that this work "involves professional theatre-makers working with young people in all kinds of educational settings and learning environments, including schools, hospitals, theaters, museums and heritage sites."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Nicholson, Helen, Applied Drama: The Gift of Theatre, Palgrave MacMillan, Basingstoke, UK, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

TIE seeks to educate young people in issues that are relevant to both them and their communities, for example: bullying, dating violence, environmental preservation, and peer conflict resolution. "TIE companies have always been among the most socially conscious of theatre groups, consistently choosing to examine issues they believe to be of direct relevance to the lives of the children with whom they work."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Anthony, and Chris Vine. Learning through Theatre: The Changing Face of Theatre in Education. 3rd ed. New York: Routledge, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Theatre for Dialogue" (TFD) is a more recent term describing a model that was created specifically for the University of Texas at Austin campus community which pulls methods and theory from a variety of applied theatre practices such as TO and TIE. In her thesis, Spring Snyder explains that "Theatre For Dialogue performances explore the intersection between theatre and education as a way to investigate, reflect, provoke dialogue and serve as a rehearsal for reality without asking participants to share their own personal experiences. Although some of the Theatre For Dialogue’s roots originate from an adapted form of Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed’s forum structure, it is Theatre in Education (TIE) that more closely aligns with TFD."&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Spring. A Transformative Classroom Experience: Exploring Campus Mental Health through Theatre For Dialogue. Thesis. University of Texas at Austin. 2015. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prison Theatre===
In prison theatre, practitioners engage offenders in correctional facilities, jails, prisons, and detention centers in exploring drama work often with the objective of education or rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shailor|first1=Jonathan|title=Performing New Lives: Prison Theatre|date=2010|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|quote=In the prison setting, as elsewhere, the needs that theatre addresses are those of self-expression and identity, freedom (of the imagination), creativity, and community.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include Wabash Valley Correctional Facility’s ''Shakespeare in Shackles'' where maximum security prisoners learn about and perform [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. The University of Texas’ Center for Women and Gender Studies’ Performing Justice Project works with incarcerated female youth to learn about gender and racial justice while devising a play based on the youth’s unique experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Drama Workshops for Anger Management and Offending Behaviour|last = Thompson|first = James|publisher = Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Theatre of the Oppressed ===
{{Main|Theatre of the Oppressed}}The '''Theatre of the Oppressed''' (TO) describes theatrical forms that the Brazilian theatre practitioner Augusto Boal first developed in the 1960s, initially in Brazil and later in Europe. Boal's techniques aim to use theatre as means of promoting social and political change through allowing the audience to take an active role in the creation of the show. Theatre of the Oppressed can include aspects of [[Forum Theatre]], [[Invisible theater|Invisible Theatre]], Legislative Theatre and [[Image theatre|Image Theatre]].

=== Museum Theatre ===
{{Main|Museum theatre}}Museum theatre aims to use theatrical techniques to add emotion and value to the museum experience.&lt;ref name="IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL"&gt;{{Cite web|title = IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL|url = http://imtal-europe.net/|website = imtal-europe.net|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically more common in cultural institutions like heritage sites, history museums, and science and industry museums.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Hughes. Museum theatre: Communicating with visitors through drama. Heinemann Drama, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Genshaft, Lindsay Michelle. "Bridging theatre and visual art: the role of an applied theatre practitioner in a fine art museum." (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; As with the other forms of applied drama, it can involve a variety of theatrical techniques.&lt;ref name="IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL" /&gt;

The '''Association for Behavior Analysis International''' ('''ABAI''') is a nonprofit organization dedicated to contributing to the well being of society by developing, enhancing, and supporting the growth of the science of [[applied behavior analysis|behavior analysis]] through research, education, and practice. ABAI has over 7,000 members. It is committed to promoting the experimental, theoretical, and applied analysis of behavior.

==History==

The Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI) was founded in 1974 as the MidWestern Association for Behavior Analysis (MABA) to serve as an interdisciplinary group of professionals, paraprofessionals, and students.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;(1978) ''The Behavior Analyst, 1''(1)&lt;/ref&gt; MABA was organized to establish a separate identity for the behavior analysis group of the larger psychological community and to provide a forum for the discussion of issues and the dissemination of information pertinent to the interests of its membership.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The first annual conference was a response by a group of behavior analysts who were having problems presenting their work at psychology conferences and other related events.&lt;ref name= "Trends In Presentations"&gt;Kangas, B.D. &amp; Vaidya, M. (2007). Trends in presentations at the annual conference of the association for behavior analysis. Behavioral Analysis, 30, 2, 117-131&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the members included [[Sidney Bijou]], James Dinsmoor, Bill Hopkins, and Roger Ulrich. The first headquarters were located on the campus of Western Michigan University (WMU) in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The association changed its name to the Association for Behavior Analysis in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;(1979) ''The Behavior Analyst, 2''(2)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the headquarters were moved off WMU's campus. In 2008, the association relocated to nearby Portage, Michigan (where it is today), and added "International" to its name.&lt;ref name= "The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science"&gt;Craighead, W.E. &amp; Nemeroff, C.B.

'''Blue flower colour''' was always associated with something unusual and desired. Blue roses especially were assumed to be a dream that cannot be realised. Blue colour in flower petals is caused by anthocyanins, which are members of flavonoid class metabolites. We can diversify three main classes of anthocyanin pigments: cyaniding type (two hydroxyl groups in the B-ring) responsible for red coloration, pelargonidin type (one hydroxyl group in the B-ring) responsible for orange colour and delphinidin type (three hydroxyl groups in the B-ring) responsible for violet/blue flower and fruits coloration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Flavonoids {{!}} SpringerLink|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-2913-6|year = 1988|isbn = 978-0-412-28770-1|last1 = Harborne|first1 = Jeffrey B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference in the structure of listed anthocyanins type is the number of hydroxyl groups in the B-ring of the anthocyanin. Nevertheless in the monomeric state anthocyanins never show blue colour in the weak acidic and neutral pH. The mechanism of blue colour formation are very complicated in most cases, presence of delphinidin type pigments is not sufficient, great role play also the pH and the formation of complexes of anthocyanins with flavones and metal ions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoshida|first=Kumi|last2=Mori|first2=Mihoko|last3=Kondo|first3=Tadao|date=2009-06-24|title=Blue flower color development by anthocyanins: from chemical structure to cell physiology|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=b800165k|journal=Natural Product Reports|language=en|volume=26|issue=7|pages=884–915|doi=10.1039/b800165k|pmid=19554240|issn=1460-4752}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

==Mechanisms==
[[File:Mechanisms_of_blue_colour_formation.png|thumb|Mechanisms of blue colour formation]]
'''Self-association''' is correlated with the anthocyanin concentration. When concentration is higher we can observe change in the absorbance maximum and increase of colour intensity. Molecules of anthocyanins associate together what results in stronger and darker colour.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asen|first=S.|last2=Stewart|first2=R.N.|last3=Norris|first3=K.H.|title=Co-pigmentation of anthocyanins in plant tissues and its effect on color|journal=Phytochemistry|volume=11|issue=3|pages=1139–1144|doi=10.1016/s0031-9422(00)88467-8|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/76863992|title=Copigmentation reactions and color stability of berry anthocyanins|last=Maarit.|first=Rein,|date=2005|publisher=University of Helsinki|others=(Yliopistopaino)|isbn=978-9521022920|location=Helsinki|oclc=76863992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Co-pigmentation''' stabilizes and gives protection to anthocyanins in the complexes. Co-pigments are colourless or have slightly yellow colour. Co-pigments usually are flavonoids (flavones, flavonols, flavanons, flavanols), other polyphenols, alkaloids, amino acids or organic acids. The most efficient co-pigments are flavonols like rutin or quercetin and phenolic acids like sinapic acid or ferulic acid.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brouillard|first=R.|last2=Mazza|first2=G.|last3=Saad|first3=Z.|last4=Albrecht-Gary|first4=A.

This phenomenon is also called bluing effect. We can diversify two types of co-pigmentation, intermolecular and intramolecular. In the first type co-pigment is bound to anthocyanin by non-covalent bond (hydrogen bond, hydrophobic interaction, ionic interaction)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. In the second type, we can observe covalent acylation of the glycosyl moiety of anthocyanin. Intramolecular co-pigmentation has stronger effect on the colour. This type of protective stacking is called also a sandwich type stacking and is a very common mechanism in the formation of blue flower colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brouillard|first=Raymond|date=January 1981|title=Origin of the exceptional colour stability of the Zebrina anthocyanin|journal=Phytochemistry|volume=20|issue=1|pages=143–145|doi=10.1016/0031-9422(81)85234-x|issn=0031-9422}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tirantin present in ''[[Clitoria ternatea]]'' (butterfly pea) and phacelianin present in ''[[Phacelia campanularia]]'' are examples of pigments with intramolecular co-pigmentation&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

'''Metal complexation''': Often blue flower colour is correlated with presence of anthocyanins in the complexes with metals ions. Metalloanthocyanins are composed from anthocyanins, flavones and metal ions in the stochiometric amounts of 6:6:2, respectively&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Typical metals in anthocyanin complexes are iron (Fe), Magnesium (Mg), aluminium (Al), copper (Cu), potassium (K) and tin (Sn). Anthocyanins that can form complexes with metal ions are only cyanidin or delphinidin type, because at least two free hydroxyl groups in the B-ring are necessary to be present&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/831116495|title=Anthocyanins as Food Colors|last=Pericles.|first=Markakis,|date=1982|publisher=Elsevier Science|year=|isbn=9780323157902|location=Oxford|pages=41–68|oclc=831116495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Examples of metalloanthocyanins:''' Commelinin isolated from ''[[Commelina communis]]'' contains malonylawobanin (delphinidin type), flavocommelin (as a co-pigment) and magnesium ions in stochiometric ratio 6:6:2.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Figure_4._Commelia_communis.jpg|thumb|''[[Commelina communis]]'']] 

Protocyanin is a blue pigment of cornflower (''[[Centaurea cyanus]]''). It is composed from succinylcyanin (anthocyanin), malonylflavone (co-pigment), iron and magnesium anions, and two calcium ions to stabilize the complex. Interesting is that the same anthocyanin when is not in complex with the metal ions is present in red rose petals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shiono|first=Masaaki|last2=Matsugaki|first2=Naohiro|last3=Takeda|first3=Kosaku|date=August 2005|title=Structure of the blue cornflower pigment|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/436791a|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=436|issue=7052|pages=791|doi=10.1038/436791a|pmid=16094358|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Figure_5_Cornflower_(Cantaurea_cyanis).jpg|thumb|Cornflower (''[[Centaurea cyanus]]'')]]

'''Fuzzy metal complex pigments:''' In the blue coloured flowers, much often instead than metalloanthocyanins we ca can find non – stochiometric metal – complex pigments stabilized by co-pigmentation. Those pigments show blue colour only in aqueous solution and are less stable than metalloanthocyanins.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Example of this kind of pigment is present in hydrangea sepals. Main anthocyanin here is delphinidin-3-glucoside what should result in the blue flower formation, but cultivars with red and pink flowers are also present. It is known that acidification of soil can cause change of the hydrangea flower colour from red/pink to blue/violet. Explanation of this phenomenon we can find in the molar ratio of co-pigment (acylquninic acid) to anthocyanin, which is much higher in the blue cells, also the level of Al3+ ions is higher in the blue flowers. Additionally, the pH of blue cell is around 4,1 and red is lower around 3,3. This supramolecule is relatively unstable and easily can fall apart in result of change of component concentration or pH conditions, so this can explain why blue colour in hydrangea sepals has low stability&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Figure_6_Hydrangea_with_different_flower_colours.jpg|thumb|Hydrangea with different flower colours]] 

'''Vacuolar pH influence on flower colour:''' pH theory was the first concept, that tried to explain the mystery of blue colour formation in flower petals. First observation showed that cyanine extracted from blue cornflower changes the colour in aqueous solution in different pH. In the acidic range pigment was red but in alkaline solution was blue. It leads to conclusion that increase of pH in cell vacuole should cause increase of blue coloration. This phenomenon we can observe in the morning glory (Ipomoea tricolor) and Japanese blue morning glory (Ipomoea nil) petals. During the flower development we can observe change of the flower colour form purple to blue. Morning glory has just one delphinidin type anthocyanin and the composition of it does not change during the flower development, but change of the colour is caused by increase of pH in vacuole of coloured cells from 6.6 in buds to 7.7 in fully matured flowers. During the early stage of development acidic pH is maintained by proton pumps, on the latter stage K+/H+ exchanger is responsible for vacuole alkalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|others=戴思兰, 洪艳|title=基于花青素苷合成和呈色机理的观赏植物花色改良分子育种|journal=中国农业科学|language=zh|volume=49|issue=3|doi=10.3864/j.issn.0578-1752.2016.03.011|issn=0578-1752}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoshida|first=Kumi|last2=Kawachi|first2=Miki|last3=Mori|first3=Mihoko|last4=Maeshima|first4=Masayoshi|last5=Kondo|first5=Maki|last6=Nishimura|first6=Mikio|last7=Kondo|first7=Tadao|date=March 2005|title=The Involvement of Tonoplast Proton Pumps and Na+(K+)/H+ Exchangers in the Change of Petal Color During Flower Opening of Morning Glory, Ipomoea tricolor cv.

==Molecular basis==
Anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway is now well known and most of the enzyme was characterised. In the formation of blue pigments a few enzymes have particularly important role. Those enzymes are especially flavonoid 3'5'-hydroxylase (F3'5'H) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR). 

The '''flavonoid 3'5'H-hydroxylase''' is responsible for introduction of second and third hydroxyl group in the B-ring of dihydrokaempferol (DHK) or naringenin which are regarded as main substrates of the reaction. Product of the reaction with DHK is dihydromyricetin (DHM), precursor for synthesis of all delphinidin type anthocyanin. Enzyme is a member of cytochrome P450 protein family (P450s). It is a very diverse group of heme-containing oxidases, which catalyse NADPH- or NADH-dependent oxidation. F3'5'H was classified into CYP75A subfamily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanaka|first=Yoshikazu|date=2006-06-01|title=Flower colour and cytochromes P450|journal=Phytochemistry Reviews|language=en|volume=5|issue=2–3|pages=283–291|doi=10.1007/s11101-006-9003-7|issn=1568-7767}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enzyme this is regarded as necessary for the blue pigment formation. 

'''Dihydroflavonol 4-reductase''' is the oxidoreductase that catalyses in the presence of NADPH the stereospecific reduction of the keto group in position 4 of dihydroflavonols producing colourless leucoanthocyanidins as a precursor for anthocyanin formation. Enzyme can show substrate specificity with respect to the B-ring hydroxylation pattern of the dihydroflavonol and can therefore have an influence on the type of formed anthocyanin. For the blue pigment formation, necessary is enzyme, which accept dihydromyricetin (DHM) as a substrate. Product of DFR reaction with DHM in the following steps of the pathway is converted to delphinidin type blue pigments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Eric T.|last2=Ryu|first2=Sunhyo|last3=Yi|first3=Hankuil|last4=Shin|first4=Byongchul|last5=Cheong|first5=Hyeonsook|last6=Choi|first6=Giltsu|date=2001-12-23|title=Alteration of a single amino acid changes the substrate specificity of dihydroflavonol 4-reductase|journal=The Plant Journal|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=325–333|doi=10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.00962.x|issn=0960-7412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==
In some very economically important flowers like roses, carnations and chrysanthemums despite a lot of efforts was not possible to breed the flowers with blue petals coloration. The lack of F3'5'H enzyme and hence delphinidin type anthocyanin is the reason why blue flower colour was not possible to obtain. 

'''Blue carnations:''' Delphinidin accumulating carnations (Dianthus caryophyllus) were obtained by overexpression of petunia F3'5'H and DFR in the cultivars, without endogenous DFR activity. As a result a few cultivars with different purple hue of the flowers were generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanaka|first=Yoshikazu|date=May 2014|title=Flower Color Modification by Engineering of the Flavonoid Biosynthetic Pathway: Practical Perspectives|journal=Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry|volume=74|issue=9|pages=1760–1769|doi=10.1271/bbb.100358|pmid=20834175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Figure_8_Example_of_purple_carnation_cultivar.jpg|thumb|Purple carnation cultivar]] 

'''Blue roses:''' Roses are especially difficult to obtain blue/violet flower colour. Lack of F3'5'H and unfavourable vacuole pH were the main obstacles. A lot of cultivars were screened to choose the proper one for genetic modification. Finally, flowers with violet/blue hues were obtained by overexpression of viola F3'5'H, down regulation of endogenous DFR and in the same time overexpression of iris (Iris x hollandica) DFR. In the result of those modifications flowers accumulate almost exclusively delphinidin type pigments in the petals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katsumoto|first=Y.|last2=Fukuchi-Mizutani|first2=M.|last3=Fukui|first3=Y.|last4=Brugliera|first4=F.|last5=Holton|first5=T.

Chemically speaking, bletting brings about an increase in [[sugar]]s and a decrease in the [[acid]]s and [[tannin]]s that make the unripe fruit astringent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Glew, R.H. |author2=Ayaz, F.A. |author3=Sanz, C. |author4=VanderJagt, D.J. |author5=Huang, H.S. |author6=Chuang, L.T. |author7=Strnad, M. |year=2003|title=Changes in sugars, organic acids and amino acids in medlar (''Mespilus germanica'' L.) during fruit development and maturation|journal=Food Chemistry|volume=83|issue=3|pages=363–369|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T6R-48JCF0M-7/2/3402a603fc264ec58884940032c62424|doi=10.1016/s0308-8146(03)00097-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rop, O. |author2=Sochor, J. |author3=Jurikova, T. |author4=Zitka, O. |author5=Skutkova, H. |author6=Mlcek, J. |author7=Salas, P. |author8=Krska, B. |author9=Babula, P. |author10=Adam, V. |author11=Kramarova, D. |author12=Beklova, M. |author13=Provaznik, I. |author14=Kizek, R. |year=2011|title=Effect of Five Different Stages of Ripening on Chemical Compounds in Medlar (''Mespilus germanica'' L.)|journal=Molecules|volume=16|issue=74-91|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/16/1/74/pdf | doi = 10.3390/molecules16010074 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ripe medlars, for example, are taken from the tree, placed somewhere cool, and allowed to ripen for several weeks. In ''Trees and Shrubs'', horticulturist [[F. A. Bush]] wrote about medlars that "if the fruit is wanted it should be left on the tree until late October and stored until it appears in the first stages of decay; then it is ready for eating. More often the fruit is used for making jelly." Ideally, the fruit should be harvested from the tree immediately following a hard frost, which starts the bletting process by breaking down [[cell wall]]s and speeding softening.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

Once the process is complete, the medlar flesh will have broken down enough that it can be spooned out of the skin. The taste of the sticky, mushy substance has been compared to sweet dates and dry applesauce, with a hint of cinnamon. In ''Notes on a Cellar-Book'', the great English [[oenophile]] [[George Saintsbury]] called bletted medlars the "ideal fruit to accompany wine."

== History ==
The [[English language|English]] verb ''[[wikt:blet|to blet]]'' was [[neologism|coined]] by [[John Lindley]], in his ''Introduction to [[Botany]]'' (1835). He derived it from the French ''poire blette'' meaning 'overripe [[pear]]'. "After the period of ripeness," he wrote, "most fleshy fruits undergo a new kind of alteration; their flesh either rots or blets."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=John|last=Lindley|year=1835 |title=Introduction to Botany |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=534EAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA296&amp;lpg=PA296&amp;dq=%22May+I+be+forgiven+for+coining+a+word+to+express+that+peculiar+bruised+appearance%22 |p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', he alluded to bletting when he wrote (IV. iii. 167) "They would have married me to the rotten Medler." [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]] also draws a misogynistic comparison in his play [[The Honest Whore]]: "I scarce know her, for the beauty of her cheek hath, like the moon, suffered strange eclipses since I beheld it: women are like medlars – no sooner ripe but rotten." Elsewhere in literature, [[D. H. Lawrence]] dubbed medlars "wineskins of brown morbidity."

There is also an old saying, used in ''[[Don Quixote]]'', that "time and straw make the medlars ripe," referring to the bletting process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1321">The '''Bremen clause''' ({{lang-de|Bremer Klausel}}) is Article 141 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]], which states:
{{cquote|''Artikel 7 Abs. 3 Satz 1 findet keine Anwendung in einem Lande, in dem am 1. Januar 1949 eine andere landesrechtliche Regelung bestand.'' 
The first sentence of paragraph (3) of Article 7 shall not apply in any state in which, on January 1, 1949, state law provides otherwise.}}
The sentence there cited says:
{{cquote|''Der Religionsunterricht ist in den öffentlichen Schulen mit Ausnahme der bekenntnisfreien Schulen ordentliches Lehrfach.''
Religious instruction shall form part of the regular curriculum in state schools, with the exception of non-denominational schools.}}

It limits the range of application of the constitutional (Basic Law) rule over [[religious education]], making it possible to have other types of instruction in some areas of [[Germany]]. A well-known example is the "instruction in [[Bible|Biblical]] history" in [[Bremen]]. It is not religious education in the sense of the Basic Law, because its content is not accountable to a [[religious community]]; therefore it is not a "[[common affair]]" ([[res mixta]]).

The '''Chapman–Jouguet condition''' holds approximately in [[detonation]] waves in [[high explosive]]s. It states that the detonation propagates at a [[velocity]] at which the reacting gases just reach [[sonic velocity]] (in the frame of the leading [[shock wave]]) as the reaction ceases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Cooper |first=Paul W. |title=Explosives Engineering |location=New York |publisher=Wiley-VCH |year=1996 |isbn=0-471-18636-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Wildon |last1=Fickett |first2=William C. |last2=Davis |title=Detonation |publisher=U.

In more detail (in the ZND model) in the frame of the leading shock of the detonation wave, gases enter at supersonic velocity and are compressed through the shock to a high-density, subsonic flow. This sudden change in pressure initiates the chemical (or sometimes, as in [[steam explosion]]s, physical) energy release. The energy release re-accelerates the flow back to the local speed of sound. It can be shown fairly simply, from the one-dimensional gas equations for steady flow, that the reaction must cease at the sonic ("CJ") plane, or there would be discontinuously large pressure [[gradient]]s at that point.

The sonic plane forms a so-called choke point that enables the lead shock, and reaction zone, to travel at a constant velocity, undisturbed by the expansion of gases in the [[rarefaction]] region beyond the CJ plane.

This simple one-dimensional model is quite successful in explaining detonations. However, observations of the structure of real chemical detonations show a complex three-dimensional structure, with parts of the wave traveling faster than average, and others slower.  Indeed, such waves are quenched as their structure is destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Edwards, D.H. |author2=Thomas, G.O. |author3=Nettleton, M.A. |last-author-amp=yes |title=The Diffraction of a Planar Detonation Wave at an Abrupt Area Change|journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics|volume= 95|issue=1|pages =79–96|year= 1979|doi=10.1017/S002211207900135X|bibcode = 1979JFM....95...79E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2514/5.9781600865497.0341.0357 |volume=75 |journal=Progress in Astronautics &amp; Aeronautics|year=1981|title=Diffraction of a Planar Detonation in Various Fuel-Oxygen Mixtures at an Area Change|isbn=978-0-915928-46-0|pages=341|editors=A.

==Mathematical description&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. (2018). Combustion theory. CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;==
The '''Rayleigh line''' equation and the '''Hugoniot curve''' equation obtained from the [[Rankine–Hugoniot conditions#Simplified Rankine-Hugoniot relations|Rankine–Hugoniot relations]] for an [[ideal gas]], with the assumption of constant specific heat and constant molecular weight, respectively are
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;\frac{\tilde p-1}{\tilde v-1} = -\mu \\
\tilde p = &amp;\frac{[2\alpha + (\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)]-\tilde v}{[(\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)]\tilde v-1},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific heat ratio]] and

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde p = \frac{p_2}{p_1},\quad \tilde v = \frac{\rho_1}{\rho_2}, \quad \alpha = \frac{q\rho_1}{p_1}, \quad \mu = \frac{m^2}{p_1\rho_1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the subscript 1 and 2 identifies flow properties (pressure &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;) upstream and downstream of the wave and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the constant mass flux and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the heat released in the wave. The slopes of Rayleigh line and Hugoniot curve are

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{d\tilde p}{d\tilde v} &amp;= \frac{\tilde p-1}{\tilde v -1}, \\
\frac{d\tilde p}{d\tilde v} &amp;= -\frac{[(\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)]\tilde p+1}{[(\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)]\tilde v-1}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

At the Chapman-Jouguet point, both slopes are equal, leading the condition that

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde p = \frac{\tilde v}{(\gamma+1)\tilde v-\gamma}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this back into the Rayleigh equation, we find 

:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \gamma\frac{\tilde p}{\tilde v}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the definition of mass flux &lt;math&gt;m\equiv \rho_1 u_1=\rho_2 u_2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; denotes the flow velocity, we find

:&lt;math&gt;M_2 = \frac{u_2}{c_2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Mach number]] and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of sound]], in other words, downstream flow is sonic with respect to the Chapman-Jouguet wave. Explicit expression for the variables can be derived,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\tilde p_{\pm} &amp;= 1 + \alpha(\gamma-1)\left\{1\pm\left[1+\frac{2\gamma}{\alpha(\gamma^2-1)}\right]^{1/2}\right\},  \\
\tilde v_{\pm} &amp;= 1 + \frac{\alpha(\gamma-1)}{\gamma}\left\{1\mp\left[1+\frac{2\gamma}{\alpha(\gamma^2-1)}\right]^{1/2}\right\}, \\
\mu_{\pm} &amp;= \gamma + \alpha(\gamma^2-1)\left\{1\pm\left[1+\frac{2\gamma}{\alpha(\gamma^2-1)}\right]^{1/2}\right\}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The upper sign applies for the '''Upper Chapman-Jouguet''' point ([[detonation]]) and the lower sign applies for the '''Lower Chapman-Jouguet''' point ([[deflagration]]). Similarly, the upstream Mach number can be found from

:&lt;math&gt;M_{1\pm} = \left[1+\frac{\alpha(\gamma^2-1)}{2\gamma}\right]^{1/2} \pm \left[\frac{\alpha(\gamma^2-1)}{2\gamma}\right]^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;

and the temperature ratio &lt;math&gt;\tilde T=T_2/T_1&lt;/math&gt; can be found from the relation &lt;math&gt;\tilde T=\tilde p\tilde v&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14426">'''Comparative physiology''' is a [[List of academic disciplines|subdiscipline]] of [[physiology]] that studies and exploits the diversity of functional characteristics of various kinds of [[organisms]].  It is closely related to [[evolutionary physiology]] and [[environmental physiology]].  Many universities offer undergraduate courses that cover comparative aspects of animal physiology. According to [[Clifford Ladd Prosser]], "Comparative Physiology
is not so much a defined discipline as a viewpoint, a philosophy."&lt;ref name="Prosser1975"/&gt;

==History==
Originally, [[physiology]] focused primarily on human beings, in large part from a desire to improve [[medical]] practices.  When physiologists first began comparing different [[species]] it was sometimes out of simple curiosity to understand how organisms work but also stemmed from a desire to discover basic physiological principles.  This use of specific organisms convenient to study specific questions is known as the [[Krogh Principle]].

==Methodology==
C. Ladd Prosser,&lt;ref name='Greenbergetal1975'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenberg|first=M. J. |author2=P. W. Hochachka |author3=C. P. Mangum |year=1975|title=Biographical data:  Clifford Ladd Prosser| url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|issn=|volume=194|issue=1|pages=5–12|doi=10.1002/jez.1401940102|pmid=1104756}}&lt;/ref&gt; a founder of modern comparative physiology, outlined a broad agenda for comparative physiology in his 1950 edited volume (see summary and discussion in [[Theodore Garland, Jr.|Garland]] and Carter&lt;ref name="GarlandCarter1994"/&gt;):

1.  To describe how different kinds of animals meet their needs.
:This amounts to cataloging functional aspects of biological diversity, and has recently been criticized as "stamp collecting" with the suggestion that the field should move beyond that initial, exploratory phase.&lt;ref name='MangumHochachka1998'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mangum|first=C. P.|author2=P. W. Hochachka|year=1998|title=New directions in comparative physiology and biochemistry: mechanisms, adaptations, and evolution| url=|journal=Physiological Zoology|issn=|volume=71|issue=5|pages=471–484|doi=|pmid=9754524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2.  The use of physiological information to reconstruct	[[phylogenetic]] relationships of organisms.&lt;br /&gt;
:In principle physiological information could be used just as morphological information or [[DNA]] sequence is used to measure evolutionary divergence of organisms.  In practice, this has rarely been done, for at least four reasons:
:* physiology doesn't leave many [[fossil]] cues,
:* it can't be measured on [[museum]] specimens,
:* it is difficult to quantify as compared with morphology or DNA sequences, and
:* physiology is more likely to be adaptive than DNA, and so subject to parallel and [[convergent evolution]], which confuses phylogenetic reconstruction.

3.  To elucidate how physiology mediates interactions between organisms and their environments.
:This is essentially [[physiological ecology]] or ecological physiology.

4.  To identify "model systems" for studying particular physiological functions.
:Examples of this include using squid giant axons to understand general principles of nerve transmission, using rattlesnake tail shaker muscles for measurement of in vivo changes in metabolites (because the whole animal can be put in an NMR machine),&lt;ref name='Conley_Lindstedt_1996'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conley|first=K. E.|author2=S. L. Lindstedt|year=1996|title=Rattlesnake tail-shaking: minimal cost per twitch in striated muscle| url=|journal=Nature|issn=|volume=383|pmid=8779716|issue=6595|pages=71–73|doi=10.1038/383071a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of ectothermic poikilotherms to study effects of temperature on physiology.

5.  To use the "kind of animal" as an experimental variable.
: "While other branches of physiology use such variables as light, temperature, oxygen tension, and hormone balance, comparative physiology uses, in addition, species or animal type as a variable for each function." &lt;ref name='prosser1950'&gt;Prosser (1950, p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;
: 25 years later, Prosser put things this way: "I like to think of it as that method in physiology which uses kind of organism as one experimental variable."&lt;ref name='Prosser1975'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prosser|first=C. L.|year=1975|title=Prospects for comparative physiology and biochemistry| url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|issn=|volume=194|pmid=1194870|issue=1|pages=345–348|doi=10.1002/jez.1401940122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative physiologists often study organisms that live in "extreme" [[Natural environment|environments]] (e.g., deserts) because they expect to find especially clear examples of evolutionary adaptation.&lt;ref name='GarlandCarter1994'&gt;{{cite journal|last= [[Theodore Garland, Jr.|Garland]] |first=T., Jr.|author2=P. A. Carter|year=1994|title=Evolutionary physiology| url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/GarlCa94.pdf|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|issn=|volume=56|issue=|pages=579–621|doi=10.1146/annurev.ph.56.030194.003051|pmid= 8010752}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One example is the study of water balance in desert-inhabiting mammals, which have been found to exhibit kidney specializations.&lt;ref name='Al-kahtani_et_al_2004'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Al-kahtani|first=M.A. |author2=C. Zuleta |author3=E. Caviedes-Vidal |author4=[[Theodore Garland, Jr|T. Garland, Jr.]] |year=2004|title=Kidney mass and relative medullary thickness of rodents in relation to habitat, body size, and phylogeny| url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Al-kahtaniEA2004.pdf|journal=Physiological and Biochemical Zoology |issn=|volume=77|issue=3|pages=346–365|doi=10.1086/420941|pmid=15286910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, comparative physiologists have been attracted to "unusual" organisms, such as very large or small ones.  As an example, of the latter, [[hummingbirds]] have been studied.  As another example, [[giraffe]] have been studied because of their long necks and the expectation that this would lead to specializations related to the regulation of [[blood pressure]].  More generally, [[ectothermic]] [[vertebrates]] have been studied to determine how [[blood]] [[acid-base balance]] and [[pH]] change as [[body temperature]] changes.

==Funding==
In the United States, research in comparative physiology is funded by both the [[National Institutes of Health]] and the [[National Science Foundation]].

[[Knut Schmidt-Nielsen]] (1915–2007) was a major figure in vertebrate comparative physiology, serving on the faculty at [[Duke University]] for many years and training a large number of students [https://web.archive.org/web/20070210060243/http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/2007/01/schmidt-nielsen.html (obituary)].  He also authored several books, including an influential text, all known for their accessible writing style.

[[Grover C. Stephens]]  (1925–2003) was a well-known invertebrate comparative physiologist, serving on the faculty of the [[University of Minnesota]] until becoming the founding chairman of the Department of Organismic Biology at the [[University of California at Irvine]] in 1964.  He was the mentor for numerous graduate students, many of whom have gone on to further build the field [http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/inmemoriam/GroverC.Stephens.htm (obituary)].  He authored several books and in addition to being an accomplished biologist was also an accomplished pianist and philosopher.

'''Ecosystem decay''' is a term coined by [[Thomas Lovejoy]] to define the process of which [[species]] become extinct locally based on [[habitat fragmentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warf|title=Encyclopedia of Geography|pages=856}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is what led to the extinction of several species, including the Irish Elk. Ecosystem decay can be mainly attributed to population isolation, leading to [[inbreeding]], leading to a decrease in the population of local species. Another factor is the absence of competition, preventing the mechanisms of natural selection to benefit the population. This leads to a lack of a skill set for the animal to adjust and adapt to a new environment. 

Although similar to [[forest fragmentation]] and [[Island Biogeography Theory|island biogeography]], ecosystem decay is what results in the event of forest fragmentation. 

==Overview==
Ecosystem decay is a natural phenomenon that has several resulting features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mokross|first=Karl|last2=Ryder|first2=Thomas B.|last3=Côrtes|first3=Marina Corrêa|last4=Wolfe|first4=Jared D.|last5=Stouffer|first5=Philip C.|date=2014-02-07|title=Decay of interspecific avian flock networks along a disturbance gradient in Amazonia|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1776/20132599|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=281|issue=1776|pages=20132599|doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.2599|issn=0962-8452|pmc=3871315|pmid=24335983}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Decline of native populations of animals
* Decrease in genetic diversity
* Decrease of the interior:[[edge effect|edge]] ratio
* Isolation of an area of viable habitat
* Reduction in viable habitats and often extreme separation

==Process==
The process through which ecosystem decay occurs can be long and complicated or short and hasty. Overall, it still follows some basic guidelines. First, a piece of habitat is surrounded and thus isolated by farmland or cities.
Secondly, pollination of the plants immediately ceases and the number of species thins out. Thirdly, through generations of inbreeding and thus higher birth mortality than birth survival rate and infertile dirt, the forest fragment will slowly decline to nothing.

== Causes ==
Ecosystem decay is commonly caused by the harvesting of rain forest in appliance to certain laws or illegally for profit by humans. Certain countries such as [[Brazil]] prohibit the harvesting of [[Brazil nut|Brazil nut trees]] and groves of this species causing forest fragmentation and thus causing ecosystem decay to occur. Cities, roads, farms and any other substantial barrier impeding and animals habitat can be a direct or an indirect cause. Naturally, fires and rising sea levels on low land can also cause habitat fragmentation and thus ecosystem decay. Although this process is much more lengthy, many species such as the [[Irish Elk]] and several species of ancient [[Australian megafauna|Australian Marsupials]] have been indirectly killed this way with contributions by [[Climate Change]], [[Glaciation]] and [[Forest Fires]].

== Studies ==
Eleonore Setz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quammen|title=The Song Of The Dodo|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=0-684-80083-7|pages=76–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; was studying a patch of equatorial rainforest named reserve #1202 containing ''[[white-faced saki|Pithecia pithecia]] (''white-faced sakis), to study the effects of ecosystem decay. The 9.2 hectare (less than 25 acre) area had been isolated for five years when [[David Quammen]] noted results on the fragmentation of their habitat which resulted in them being stranded. The population of ''P. Pithecia'' was slowly declining at the time of the study and the population had declined to six.

'''Ecosystem diversity''' deals with the variations in [[ecosystem]]s within a [[geographical location]] and its overall impact on human existence and the [[environmental impact|environment]].

Ecosystem diversity is a type of [[biodiversity]]. It is the variation in the [[ecosystems]] found in a region or the variation in ecosystems over the whole planet. Biodiversity is important because it clears out our water, changes out climate, and provides us with food. Ecological diversity includes the variation in both [[Terrestrial ecosystem|terrestrial]] and [[aquatic ecosystem]]s. Ecological diversity can also take into account the variation in the [[complexity]] of a [[biological community]], including the number of different [[ecological niche|niches]], the number of [[trophic level]]s and other ecological processes. An example of ecological diversity on a global scale would be the variation in ecosystems, such as [[desert]]s, [[forest]]s, [[grassland]]s, [[wetland]]s and [[ocean]]s.

== Impact ==

Diversity in the ecosystem is significant to human existence for a variety of reasons. Ecosystem diversity boosts the availability of [[oxygen]] via the process of [[photosynthesis]] amongst plant organisms domiciled in the habitat. Diversity In an aquatic environment helps in the [[water purification|purification of water]] by plant varieties for use by humans. Diversity increases plant varieties which serves as a good source for medicines and [[herb]]s for human use.  A lack of diversity in the ecosystem produces an opposite result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Naveh|first=Z.|date=1994-09-01|title=From Biodiversity to Ecodiversity: A Landscape-Ecology Approach to Conservation and Restoration|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-100X.1994.tb00065.x/abstract|journal=Restoration Ecology|language=en|volume=2|issue=3|pages=180–189|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.1994.tb00065.x|issn=1526-100X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Some examples of ecosystems that are rich in diversity are:
* [[Deserts]]
* [[Forests]]
* [[Large marine ecosystem]]s
* [[Marine ecosystem]]s
* [[Old growth forest]]s
* [[Rainforest]]s
* [[Tundra]]
* [[Coral Reef]]s
* [[Marine biology|Marine]]


== Ecosystem diversity as a result of evolutionary pressure ==
Ecological diversity around the world can be directly linked to the evolutionary and [[Evolutionary pressure|selective pressures]] that constrain the [[Diversity index|diversity]] outcome of the ecosystems within different [[Niche segregation|niches]]. [[Tundra|Tundras]], [[Rainforest|Rainforests]], coral reefs and [[deciduous forests]] all are formed as a result of [[Evolutionary pressure|evolutionary pressures]]. Even seemingly small evolutionary interactions can have large impacts on the diversity of the [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] throughout the world. One of the best studied cases of this is of the honey bee's interaction with [[Flowering plant|angiosperms]] on every continent in the world except [[Antarctica|Antartica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://animals.mom.me/continents-bees-not-found-5374.html|title=On What Continents Are Bees Not Found?|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010 Robert Brodschneider, and Karl Crailsheim conducted a study about the health and nutrition in honey bee colonies, the study conducted focused on: overall colony health, adult nutrition, and [[larva]] nutrition as a function of the effect of [[Pesticide|pesticides]], [[Monoculture|monocultures]] and genetically modified crops to see if the anthropogenically created problems can have an effect pollination levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brodschneider|first=Robert|date=2010|title=Nutrition and health in Honey bees|url=https://www.apidologie.org/articles/apido/pdf/2010/03/m09120.pdf|journal=Apidologie|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results indicate that human activity does have a role in the destruction of the fitness of the bee colony. The extinction or near extinction of these pollinators would result in many plants that feed humans on a wide scale, needing alternative pollination methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2015/2015/bee_tech.html|title=Mission 2015: Bee Technology|website=web.mit.edu|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crop pollinating insects are worth annually 14.6 billion to the [[Economy of the United States|US economy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/5193-Decline-of-bees-forces-China-s-apple-farmers-to-pollinate-by-hand|title=Decline of bees forces China's apple farmers to pollinate by hand|website=www.chinadialogue.net|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cost to hand pollinate over insect pollination will cost an estimated 5,715-$7,135 per hectare additionally. Not only will there be a cost increase but also an decrease in colony fitness, leading to a decrease in genetic diversity, which studies have shown has a direct link to the long term survival of the honey bee colonies. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/06/130617111341.htm|title=Genetic diversity key to survival of honey bee colonies|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to a study, there are over 50 plants that are dependent on bee pollination, many of these being key staples to feeding the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930020735/http://gears.tucson.ars.ag.gov/beeclass/Pollination.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=2007-09-30|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study conducted states that as a direct result of a lack of [[Plant diversity and evolution|plant diversity]], will lead to a decline in the bee population fitness, and a low bee colony fitness has impacts on the fitness of plant ecosystem diversity. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Science_News/2018/08/22/Plant-biodiversity-essential-to-bee-health/7391534949396/|title=Plant biodiversity essential to bee health|work=UPI|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By allowing for bee pollination and working to reduce [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenically]] harmful footprints, bee pollination can increase flora growth genetic diversity and create a unique ecosystem that is highly diverse and can provide a habitat and niche for many other organisms to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/why-bees-are-important-to-our-planet/|title=Why Bees Are Important to Our Planet - One Green Planet|website=www.onegreenplanet.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the evolutionary pressures of bees being located on six out of seven continents, there can be no denying the impact of [[Pollinator|pollinators]] on the ecosystem diversity. The [[pollen]] collected by the bees is harvested and used as an energy source for winter time, this act of collecting pollen from local plants also has a more important effect of facilitating the movement of genes between [[Organism|organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Min|last2=Compton|first2=Stephen G.|last3=Peng|first3=Fo-En|last4=Zhang|first4=Jian|last5=Chen|first5=Xiao-Yong|date=2015-06-07|title=Movements of genes between populations: are pollinators more effective at transferring their own or plant genetic markers?|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455804/|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=282|issue=1808|doi=10.1098/rspb.2015.0290|issn=0962-8452|pmc=4455804|pmid=25948688}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new evolutionary pressures that are largely [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenically]] catalyzed can potentially cause wide spread collapse of ecosystems. In the north Atlantic sea, a study was conducted that followed the effects of the human interaction on surrounding ocean habitats. They found that in there was no [[habitat]] or [[trophic level]] that in some way was effected negatively by human interaction, and that much of the diversity of life was being stunted as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lotze|first=Heike K.|last2=Milewski|first2=Inka|date=October 2004|title=TWO CENTURIES OF MULTIPLE HUMAN IMPACTS AND SUCCESSIVE CHANGES IN A NORTH ATLANTIC FOOD WEB|url=https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/03-5027|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=14|issue=5|pages=1428–1447|doi=10.1890/03-5027|issn=1051-0761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23013">'''Epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid'''s ('''EEQ'''s or '''EpETE'''s) are a set of biologically active [[epoxides]] that various cell types make by metabolizing the [[omega 3 fatty acid]], [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), with certain [[cytochrome P450]] [[epoxygenase]]s. These epoxygenases can metabolize EPA to as many as 10 epoxides that differ in the site and/or stereoisomer of the epoxide formed; however, the formed EEQs, while differing in potency, often have similar bioactivities and are commonly considered together.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18952572 | pmc = 2674692 | year = 2009 | author1 = Spector | first1 = A.

==Structure==
EPA is a straight-chain, 20 carbon [[omega-3 fatty acid]] containing cis (see [[Cis–trans isomerism]]) double bounds between carbons 5 and 6, 8 and 9, 11 and 12, 14 and 15, and 17 and 18; each of these double bonds is designated with the notation ''Z'' to indicate its cis configuration in the IUPAC [[Chemical nomenclature]] used here. EPA is therefore 5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z'',17''Z''-eicosapentaenoic acid. Certain cytochrome P450 epoxygenases metabolize EPA by converting one of these double bounds to an epoxide thereby forming one of 5 possible eicosatetraenoic acid epoxide regioisomers (see [[Structural isomer]], section on position isomerism (regioisomerism)). These regioisomers are: 5,6-EEQ (i.e. 5,6-epoxy-8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z'',17''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid), 8,9-EEQ (i.e. 8,9-epoxy-5''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z'',17''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid), 11,12-EEQ (i.e. 11,12-epoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',14''Z'',17''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid), 14,15-EEQ (i.e. 14,15-epoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',17''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid, and 17,18-EEQ (i.e. 17,18-epoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid. The epoxydases typically make both ''R''/''S'' [[enantiomers]] of each epoxide.  For example, they metabolize EPA at its 17,18 double bond to a mixture of 17''R'',18''S''-EEQ and 17''S'',18''R''-EEQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24345640 | pmc = 3914417 | year = 2014 | author1 = Zhang | first1 = G | title = Stabilized epoxygenated fatty acids regulate inflammation, pain, angiogenesis and cancer | journal = Progress in Lipid Research | volume = 53 | pages = 108–23 | last2 = Kodani | first2 = S | last3 = Hammock | first3 = B.

==Production==
Cellular cytochrome P450 epoxygenases metabolize various [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s to epoxide-containng products. They metabolize the omega-6 fatty acids [[arachidonic acid]], which possess four double bonds, to 8 different epoxide isomers which are termed [[epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]s or EETs and [[linoleic acid]], which possess two double bonds, to 4 different epoxide isomers, i.e. two different 9,10-epoxide isomers termed [[vernolic acid]]s or leukotoxins and two different 12,13-epoxides isomers termed [[coronaric acid]]s or isoleukotoxins. They metabolize the [[omega-3 fatty acid]], [[docosahexaenoic acid]], which possesses 6 double bonds, to 12 different [[epoxydocosapentaenoic acid]] (EDPs) isomers. In general, the same epoxygenases that accomplish these metabolic conversions also metabolize the omega-6 fatty acid, EPA, to 10 epoxide isomers, the EEQs.  These epoxygenases fall into several subfamilies including the cytochrome P4501A (i.e.CYP1A), CYP2B, CYP2C, CYP2E, and CYP2J subfamilies, and within the CYP3A subfamily, CYP3A4. In humans, [[CYP1A1]], [[CYP1A2]], [[CYP2C8]], [[CYP2C9]], [[CYP2C18]], [[CYP2C19]], [[CYP2E1]], [[CYP2J2]], [[CYP3A4]], and [[CYP2S1]] metabolize EPA to EEQs, in most cases forming principally 17,18-EEQ with smaller amounts of 5,6-EEQ, 8,9-EEQ, 11,12-EEQ, and 14,15-EEQ isomers.&lt;ref name="Arch Biochem Biophys 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18206980 | year = 2008 | author1 = Fer | first1 = M | title = Metabolism of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids by recombinant human cytochromes P450 | journal = Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics | volume = 471 | issue = 2 | pages = 116–25 | last2 = Dréano | first2 = Y | last3 = Lucas | first3 = D | last4 = Corcos | first4 = L | last5 = Salaün | first5 = J.

The EEQ-forming cytochromes are widely distributed in the tissues of humans and other mammals, including blood vessel endothelium, blood vessel [[atheroma]] placques, heart muscle, kidneys, pancreas, intestine, lung, brain, [[monocyte]]s, and [[macrophage]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Antioxid Redox Signal 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25655310 | pmc = 4500322 | year = 2015 | author1 = Yang | first1 = L | title = The role of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids in the cardiovascular system | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 80 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–44 | last2 = Mäki-Petäjä | first2 = K | last3 = Cheriyan | first3 = J | last4 = McEniery | first4 = C | last5 = Wilkinson | first5 = I.

==EEQ metabolism==
In cells, EEQs are rapidly metabolized by the same enzyme that similarly metabolizes other epoxy fatty acids including the EETs viz., cytosolic [[soluble epoxide hydrolase]] [EC 3.2.2.10.] (also termed sEH or the EPHX2), to form their corresponding [[Vicinal (chemistry)]] [[diol]] dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (diHETEs). The omega-3 fatty acid epoxides, EEQs and EPAs, appear to be preferred over EETs as substates for sEH.&lt;ref name="Antioxid Redox Signal 2014"/&gt; sEH converts 17,18-EEQ isomers to 17,18-dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid isomers (17,18-diHETEs), 14,15-EEQ isomers to 14,15-diHETE isomers, 11,12-EEQ isomers to 11,12-diHETE isomers, 8,9-EEQ isomers to 8,9-diHETE isomers, and 5,6-EEQ isomers to 5,6-diHETE isomers.&lt;ref name="Gene p 10"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23701967 | pmc = 3733540 | year = 2013 | author1 = Harris | first1 = T.

H. | doi = 10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.09.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Membrane-bound [[Microsomal epoxide hydrolase]] (mEH or Epoxide hydrolase 2 [EC 3.2.2.9.]) can metabolize EEQs to their dihydroxy products but is regarded as not contributing significantly to EEQ inactivation in vivo except possibly in rare tissues where the sEH level is exceptionally low while the mEH level is high.&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2014. p 18"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25240260 | pmc = 4254344 | year = 2014 | author1 = Wagner | first1 = K | title = The role of long chain fatty acids and their epoxide metabolites in nociceptive signaling | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 113-115 | pages = 2–12 | last2 = Vito | first2 = S | last3 = Inceoglu | first3 = B | last4 = Hammock | first4 = B.

In addition to the sEH pathway, EETs may be acylated into phospholipids in an [[Acylation]]-like reaction.  This pathway may serve to limit the action of EETs or store them for future release.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;  EETs are also inactivated by being further metabolized though three other pathways: [[Beta oxidation]], [[Omega oxidation]], and elongation by enzymes involved in [[Fatty acid synthesis]].&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2014. p 18"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22848834 | pmc = 3405717 | year = 2012 | author1 = Thomson | first1 = S.

==Clinical significance==
EEQS, similar to EDPs, have not be studied nearly as well as the EETs.  In comparison to the many activities attributed to the EETs in animal model studies (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]), a limited set of studies indicate that EEQs (and EPAs) mimic EETS in their abilities to dilate arterioles, reduce hypertension, inhibit inflammation (the anti-inflammatory actions of EEQ are less potent than those of the EETs) and thereby reduce occlusion of arteries to protect the heart and prevent and [[stroke]]s (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid#Clinical significance]] sections on '''a)''' Regulation of blood pressure, '''b)''' Heart disease, '''c)''' Strokes and seizures, and '''d)''' inflammation); they also mimic EETs in possessing [[analgesia]] properties in relieving certain types of pain (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid#Clinical significance#Pain]]).&lt;ref name="Antioxid Redox Signal 2014"/&gt;  Often, the EEQs (and EPAs) exhibit greater potency and/or effectiveness than EET in these actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25244930 | year = 2014 | author1 = Fleming | first1 = I | title = The pharmacology of the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase/soluble epoxide hydrolase axis in the vasculature and cardiovascular disease | journal = Pharmacological Reviews | volume = 66 | issue = 4 | pages = 1106–40 | doi = 10.1124/pr.113.007781 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Antioxid Redox Signal 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26975734 | year = 2016 | author1 = Fleming | first1 = I | title = The factor in EDHF: Cytochrome P450 derived lipid mediators and vascular signaling | journal = Vascular Pharmacology | doi = 10.1016/j.vph.2016.03.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In human studies potentially relevant to one or more of these activities, consumption of long chain omega-3 fatty acid (i.e. EPA- and DHA-rich) diet produced significant reductions in systolic blood pressure and increased peripheral arteriole blood flow and reactivity in patients at high to intermediate risk for cardiovascular events; an EPA/DHA-rich diet also reduced the risk while high serum levels of DHA and EPA were associated with a low risk of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18689376 | year = 2008 | author1 = Augood | first1 = C | title = Oily fish consumption, dietary docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid intakes, and associations with neovascular age-related macular degeneration | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 88 | issue = 2 | pages = 398–406 | last2 = Chakravarthy | first2 = U | last3 = Young | first3 = I | last4 = Vioque | first4 = J | last5 = De Jong | first5 = P.

The '''Faculty of Political Science of the University of Ankara''' ({{lang-tr|'''Ankara Üniversitesi Siyasal Bilgiler Fakültesi'''}}, more simply known as "'''''SBF'''''") is the oldest faculty of [[social science]] in [[Turkey]], being the successor of the "'''Mekteb-i Mülkiye'''" (also known as the "'''Mülkiye'''") which was established in [[Istanbul]] on February 12, 1859, under the reign of [[Sultan Abdulaziz]], then moved to [[Ankara]] in 1936 under a new name, and was incorporated to [[Ankara University]] on April 3, 1950, under its current name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siyasiilimler.org.tr/docpdf/The_Origins_of_Political_Studies-Ilter_Turan.pdf İlter Turan - "Political Science in Turkey,  The Origins of Political Studies", Istanbul Bilgi University.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Faculty of Political Science provides higher education in the fields of Social Science, Public Finance, Economics, Public Administration, Labor Economics, Business Administration and International Relations.
It is considered to be one of the most influential institutes in the political life of Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politics.ankara.edu.tr/english/index.php|title=Ankara University, Faculty of Economic Science|first=|date=|website=www.politics.ankara.edu.tr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The faculty was founded in Istanbul as a community college in 1859 and has undergone series of changes since the establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Carter Vaughn Findley, Ottoman Civil Officialdom: A Social History, Princeton University Press, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; It was named Mekteb-i Mülkiye-i Şahane under the Ministry of Internal Affairs but in 1918 the name was changed to "Mekteb-i Mülkiye" under the Ministry of Education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Mülkiyeusa.com/#!meet-the-faculty/aboutPage Mülkiye USA - Meet the Faculty]&lt;/ref&gt; After the founding of the Republic, at the request of Atatürk, the school was moved to Ankara, and named the School of Political Science. The length of study was also increased to 4 years. On March 23, 1950, the school was placed under Ankara University, and its name was changed to Ankara University, Faculty of Political Science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.ankara.edu.tr/english/?bil=bil_icerik&amp;icerik_id=284&amp;menu=0&amp;ens_birim=0 SBF - Faculty Information]&lt;/ref&gt; The school has been a symbol of freedom of expression and organization. Holders of every different political view have found there an environment in which they could freely express themselves on a democratic platform as an important difference between Mülkiye and other universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/Mülkiye-celebrates-glorious-history.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=Mülkiye-celebrates-glorious-history-2006-12-05 Hurriyet Daily News - Mülkiye celebrates glorious history, 05.12.2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/14683857.2014.882079 | volume=14 | title=The role of academics in Turkey's politics: the Mülkiye Junta and the transformation of the Republican People's Party | year=2014 | journal=Southeast European and Black Sea Studies | pages=109–128 | last1 = Emre | first1 = Yunus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masters and Doctorate programs were implemented in the 1955-56 academic year. In 1982, the faculty adopted the new framework, increasing the number of specialization departments to six: International Relations, Political Science and Public Administration, Economics, Public Finance, Business Administration, Labor Economics and Industrial Relations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.ankara.edu.tr/english/index.php SBF - Departments]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 2008-2009 academic year, Foreign Language Preparatory School has been mandatory.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Staff and Alumni==
The faculty currently has 172 academic staff (42 professors, 33 associate professors, 34 assistant professors, 18 research assistants with doctorates, 35 research assistants pursuing doctorate degrees, four lecturers and six experts) and 78 administrative staff.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The faculty's alumni, who are also called Mülkìyelìler, are employed in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, Public Finance and in public institutions including banks and private companies. A number of alumni have served as prime ministers, ministers, deputies, ambassadors, and governors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=Mülkiye-8211-an-elite-school-or-a-school-for-elites-2009-12-28 Hurriyet Daily News - Mülkiye; an elite school or a school for elites?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mülkiyeliler Birliği, the faculty's Alumni Association is a non-governmental organization with branches across the country. It organizes variety of courses, seminars, symposiums and exhibitions. It also publishes magazines and books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://Mülkiye.org.tr/ Mülkiyeliler Birliği]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education Facilities==
The faculty has several teaching facilities to meet the needs of various courses and departments. In addition to the two amphis, the faculty has a 450-seat conference hall, several large classrooms, seminar rooms, multipurpose rooms and computer centers.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

For all departments, English language preparation classes have been mandatory since 2008-2009. In addition, foreign language courses are available. Since the 1992-1993 academic year, language courses covering the departmental terminology have been given as electives.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9524">'''Frst-order hold''' ('''FOH''') is a mathematical model of the practical reconstruction of sampled signals that could be done by a conventional [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC) and an [[analog circuit]] called an [[integrator]].  For FOH, the signal is reconstructed as a [[Piecewise linear function|piecewise linear]] approximation to the original signal that was sampled.  A mathematical model such as FOH (or, more commonly, the [[zero-order hold]]) is necessary because, in the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|sampling and reconstruction theorem]], a sequence of [[Dirac delta function|Dirac impulses]], ''x''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), representing the discrete samples, ''x''(''nT''), is [[low-pass filter]]ed to recover the original signal that was sampled, ''x''(''t'').  However, outputting a sequence of Dirac impulses is impractical. Devices can be implemented, using a conventional DAC and some linear analog circuitry, to reconstruct the piecewise linear output for either predictive or delayed FOH.

Even though this is ''not'' what is physically done, an identical output can be generated by applying the hypothetical sequence of Dirac impulses, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), to a [[Linear time-invariant theory|linear time-invariant system]], otherwise known as a [[electronic filter|linear filter]] with such characteristics (which, for an LTI system, are fully described by the [[impulse response]]) so that each input impulse results in the correct piecewise linear function in the output.

==Basic first-order hold==
[[Image:Sampled.signal.svg|thumb|Ideally sampled signal ''x''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'').]]

First-order hold is the hypothetical [[filter (signal processing)|filter]] or [[LTI system]] that converts the ideally sampled signal

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;x_s(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= x(t) \ T \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t - nT) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= T \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x(nT) \delta(t - nT) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

[[Image:Firstorderhold.signal.svg|thumb|Piecewise linear signal ''x''&lt;sub&gt;FOH&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'').]]

to the piecewise linear signal

:&lt;math&gt;x_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t)\,= \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x(nT) \mathrm{tri} \left(\frac{t - nT}{T} \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Firstorderhold.impulseresponse.svg|thumb|Impulse response (non-causal) of first-order hold ''h''&lt;sub&gt;FOH&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'').]]

resulting in an effective [[impulse response]] of

: &lt;math&gt;h_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t)\,=  \frac{1}{T} \mathrm{tri} \left(\frac{t}{T} \right)
 = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{T} \left( 1 - \frac{|t|}{T} \right) &amp; \mbox{if } |t| &lt; T  \\
0           &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases} \ &lt;/math&gt;

: where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{tri}(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[triangular function]].

The effective frequency response is the [[continuous Fourier transform]] of the impulse response.

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{FOH}}(f)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \mathcal{F} \{ h_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t) \} \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \left( \frac{e^{i \pi fT} - e^{-i \pi fT}}{i 2 \pi fT} \right)^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \mathrm{sinc}^2(fT) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

: where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{sinc}(x) = \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x} \ &lt;/math&gt; is the normalized [[sinc function]].

The [[Laplace transform]] [[transfer function]] of FOH is found by substituting ''s'' = ''i'' 2 π ''f'':

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{FOH}}(s)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \mathcal{L} \{ h_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t) \} \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \left( \frac{e^{sT/2} - e^{-sT/2}}{sT} \right)^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

This is an [[acausal system]] in that the linear interpolation function moves toward the value of the next sample before such sample is applied to the hypothetical FOH filter.

==Delayed first-order hold==
[[Image:Delayedfirstorderhold.signal.svg|thumb|Delayed piecewise linear signal ''x''&lt;sub&gt;FOH&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'').]]

'''Delayed first-order hold''', sometimes called '''causal first-order hold''', is identical to FOH above except that its output is delayed by one [[sampling frequency|sample period]] resulting in a delayed piecewise linear output signal

:&lt;math&gt;x_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t)\,= \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x(nT) \mathrm{tri} \left(\frac{t - T - nT}{T} \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Delayedfirstorderhold.impulseresponse.svg|thumb|Impulse response of causal first-order hold ''h''&lt;sub&gt;FOH&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'').]]

resulting in an effective [[impulse response]] of

: &lt;math&gt;h_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t)\,=  \frac{1}{T} \mathrm{tri} \left(\frac{t-T}{T} \right)
 = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{T} \left( 1 - \frac{|t-T|}{T} \right) &amp; \mbox{if } |t-T| &lt; T  \\
0           &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases} \ &lt;/math&gt;

: where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{tri}(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[triangular function]].

The effective frequency response is the [[continuous Fourier transform]] of the impulse response.

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{FOH}}(f)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \mathcal{F} \{ h_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t) \} \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \left( \frac{1 - e^{-i 2\pi fT}}{i 2 \pi fT} \right)^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= e^{-i 2 \pi fT} \mathrm{sinc}^2(fT) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

: where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{sinc}(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[sinc function]].

The [[Laplace transform]] [[transfer function]] of the delayed FOH is found by substituting ''s'' = ''i'' 2 π ''f'':

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{FOH}}(s)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \mathcal{L} \{ h_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t) \} \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=  \left( \frac{1 - e^{-sT}}{sT} \right)^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

The delayed output makes this a [[causal system]].  The impulse response of the delayed FOH does not respond before the input impulse.

This kind of delayed piecewise linear reconstruction is physically realizable by implementing a [[digital filter]] of gain ''H''(''z'') = 1 − ''z''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, applying the output of that digital filter (which is simply ''x''[''n'']−''x''[''n''−1]) to an ideal conventional [[digital-to-analog converter]] (that has an inherent [[zero-order hold]] as its model) and integrating (in continuous-time, ''H''(''s'') = 1/(''sT'')) the DAC output.

==Predictive first-order hold==
[[Image:Predictivefirstorderhold.signal.svg|thumb|Predictive FOH output signal ''x''&lt;sub&gt;FOH&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'').]]

Lastly, the '''predictive first-order hold''' is quite different.  This is a ''causal'' hypothetical LTI system or filter that converts the ideally sampled signal

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;x_s(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= x(t) \ T \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t - nT) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= T \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x(nT) \delta(t - nT) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

into a piecewise linear output such that the current sample and immediately previous sample are used to linearly [[extrapolate]] up to the next sampling instance.  The output of such a filter would be 

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;x_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \left( x(nT) + \left( x(nT) - x((n-1)T) \right) \frac{t-nT}{T} \right) \mathrm{rect} \left(\frac{t - nT}{T} - \frac{1}{2} \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x(nT) \left( \mathrm{rect} \left(\frac{t - nT}{T} - \frac{1}{2} \right) - \mathrm{rect} \left(\frac{t - nT}{T} - \frac{3}{2} \right) + \mathrm{tri} \left(\frac{t - nT}{T} - 1 \right) \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

[[Image:Predictivefirstorderhold.impulseresponse.svg|thumb|Impulse response of predictive first-order hold ''h''&lt;sub&gt;FOH&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'').]]

resulting in an effective [[impulse response]] of

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;h_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=  \frac{1}{T}  \left( \mathrm{rect} \left(\frac{t}{T} - \frac{1}{2} \right) - \mathrm{rect} \left(\frac{t}{T} - \frac{3}{2} \right) + \mathrm{tri} \left(\frac{t}{T} -1 \right) \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{T} \left( 1 + \frac{t}{T} \right) &amp; \mbox{if } 0 \le t &lt; T  \\
\frac{1}{T} \left( 1 - \frac{t}{T} \right) &amp; \mbox{if } T \le t &lt; 2T  \\
0           &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases} \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

: where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{rect}(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[rectangular function]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{tri}(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[triangular function]].

The effective frequency response is the [[continuous Fourier transform]] of the impulse response.

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{FOH}}(f)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \mathcal{F} \{ h_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t) \} \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= (1 + i 2\pi fT) \left( \frac{1 - e^{-i 2\pi fT}}{i 2\pi fT} \right)^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= (1 + i 2\pi fT) e^{-i 2\pi fT} \mathrm{sinc}^2(fT)) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

: where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{sinc}(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[sinc function]].

The [[Laplace transform]] [[transfer function]] of the predictive FOH is found by substituting ''s'' = ''i'' 2 π ''f'':

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{FOH}}(s)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \mathcal{L} \{ h_{\mathrm{FOH}}(t) \} \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=  (1 + sT) \left( \frac{1 - e^{-sT}}{sT} \right)^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

This a [[causal system]].  The impulse response of the predictive FOH does not respond before the input impulse.

This kind of piecewise linear reconstruction is physically realizable by implementing a [[digital filter]] of gain ''H''(''z'') = 1 − ''z''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, applying the output of that digital filter (which is simply ''x''[''n'']−''x''[''n''−1]) to an ideal conventional [[digital-to-analog converter]] (that has an inherent [[zero-order hold]] as its model) and applying that DAC output to an analog filter with transfer function ''H''(''s'') = (1+''sT'')/(''sT'').

The '''Fukushima disaster cleanup''' is an ongoing attempt to limit [[radioactive contamination]] from the three nuclear reactors involved in the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] which followed the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011]].
The affected reactors were adjacent to one another and accident management was made much more difficult because of the number of simultaneous hazards concentrated in a small area. 
Failure of emergency power following the tsunami resulted in loss of coolant from each reactor, hydrogen explosions damaging the reactor buildings, and water draining from open-air [[spent fuel pool]]s. 
Plant workers were put in the position of trying to cope simultaneously with [[nuclear meltdown|core meltdowns]] at three reactors and exposed fuel pools at three units.

Automated cooling systems were installed within 3 months from the accident. 
A fabric cover was built to protect the buildings from storms and heavy rainfall. 
New detectors were installed at the plant to track emissions of [[xenon]] gas. 
Filters were installed to reduce contaminants from escaping the area of the plant into the area or atmosphere. 
Cement has been laid near to the seabed to control contaminants from accidentally entering the ocean.

At the time of the initial event, 50 [[TEPCO]] employees remained onsite in the immediate aftermath to work to stabilize the plant and begin cleanup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='I am one of the Fukushima fifty': One of the men who risked their lives to prevent a catastrophe shares his story |author=David McNeill |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/i-am-one-of-the-fukushima-fifty-one-of-the-men-who-risked-their-lives-to-prevent-a-catastrophe-shares-his-story-8517394.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=2 March 2013 |accessdate=5 March 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, TEPCO did not put forward a strategy to regain control of the situation in the reactors. Helmut Hirsch, a German physicist and nuclear expert, said "they are improvising with tools that were not intended for this type of situation".&lt;ref name=Hackenbroch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,754868,00.html |title=A hapless Fukushima clean-up effort |author=Veronika Hackenbroch, Cordula Meyer and Thilo Thielke |date=5 April 2011 |work=Der Spiegel}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 17 April 2011, TEPCO appeared to put forward the broad basis of a plan which included: (1) reaching "cold shutdown in about six to nine months;" (2) "restoring stable cooling to the reactors and spent fuel pools in about three months;" (3) putting "special covers" on Units 1, 3, and 4 starting in June;(4) installing "additional storage containers for the radioactive water that has been pooling in the turbine basements and outside trenches;"&lt;ref name="spectrum.ieee.org"&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/energy/nuclear/tepco-announces-a-roadmap-to-restoration-at-fukushima-dai-1 TEPCO Announces a "Roadmap to restoration" at Fukushima Dai-1 - IEEE Spectrum].

On 5 May 2011, workers were able to enter reactor buildings for the first time since the accident.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13289877 Workers enter reactor building], NHK, 5 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The workers began to install air filtration systems to clean air of radioactive materials to allow additional workers to install water cooling systems.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Scope of cleanup==

Japanese reactor maker Toshiba said it could decommission the earthquake-damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant in about 10 years, a third quicker than the American Three Mile Island plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13023213 |title= Japan: Minister in first tour of stricken nuclear plant |publisher=BBC News |date=9 April 2011 |accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a comparison, at Three Mile Island the vessel of the partially melted core was first opened 11 years after the accident, with cleanup activities taking several more years.

TEPCO announced it restored the automated cooling systems in the damaged reactors in about three months, and had the reactors put into cold shutdown status in six months.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110418a1.html Reactor shutdowns nine months away]", ''Japan Times, 18 April 2011.''&lt;/ref&gt;

First estimates included costs as high as {{JPY|1 trillion}} ({{USD|13 billion}}), as cited by the Japanese Prime Minister at the time, [[Yoshihiko Noda]] (野田 佳彦). However, this estimate was made before the scope of the problem was known. It seems that the contamination was less than feared. No strontium is detectable in the soil,&lt;ref name="ajw.asahi.com"/&gt; and though the crops of the year of the disaster were contaminated, the crops produced by the area now are safe for human consumption.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"/&gt;

Japan's economy, trade, and industry ministry recently ({{as of|2016|lc=yes}}) estimated the total cost of dealing with the Fukushima disaster at {{JPY|21.5 trillion}} ({{USD|187 billion}}), almost twice the previous estimate of {{JPY|11 trillion}} ({{USD|96 billion}}). A rise in compensation for victims of the disaster from {{JPY|5.4 trillion}} ({{USD|47 billion}}) to {{JPY|7.9 trillion}} ({{USD|69 billion}}) was expected, with decontamination costs estimated to rise from {{JPY|2.5 trillion}} ({{USD|22 billion}}) to {{JPY|4 trillion}} ({{USD|35 billion}}), costs for interim storage of radioactive material to increase from {{JPY|1.1 trillion}} ({{USD|10 billion}}) to {{JPY|1.6 trillion}} ({{USD|14 billion}}), and costs of decomissioning reactors to increase from {{JPY|2 trillion}} ({{USD|17 billion}}) to {{JPY|8 trillion}} ({{USD|69 billion}}).&lt;ref name="the-mainichi-dec2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=2.4 trillion yen in Fukushima crisis compensation costs to be tacked onto power bills|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20161210/p2a/00m/0na/002000c|accessdate=10 March 2017|work=Mainichi Daily News|publisher=The Mainichi|date=10 December 2016|language=en|quote=At the meeting, the ministry also revealed that the estimated cost of dealing with the disaster has hit 21.5 trillion yen -- nearly double the initial projection of 11 trillion yen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Total compensation for people affected by the disaster is estimated to rise from 5.4 trillion yen to 7.9 trillion yen, and decontamination-associated costs are likely to grow from 2.5 trillion yen to 4 trillion yen. The bill for building interim storage facilities for radioactive materials is expected to rise from 1.1 trillion yen to 1.6 trillion yen, while that of decommissioning reactors at the crippled plant will likely surge from 2 trillion yen to 8 trillion yen.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working conditions at the plant==

There has been concern that the plant would be dangerous for workers. Two workers suffered skin burns from radiation, but no serious injuries or fatalities have been documented to have been caused by radiation at Fukushima Dai-ichi.

===Unskilled workforce systematically employed on Japanese nuclear power plants===
The disaster in Fukushima has revealed the practice of Japanese nuclear power plants systematically using unskilled laborers with short contracts. These people are paid per day, and are hired per day from questionable agencies and firms. From data provided by NISA, it was concluded that 80 percent of all of the workforce hired in commercial nuclear power plants is done using temporary contracts, In Fukushima this number was even higher, at 89 percent. This had been practiced for decades. Unemployed people gathered in parks in the morning, and were picked up to be taken to the nuclear power plants. They would get a contract for a few months to do unskilled and the most dangerous labor. After the work was finished, these people were supposed to disappear.&lt;ref&gt;(dutch) AD (6 September 2011) [http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1013/Buitenland/article/detail/2893265/2011/09/06/Fukushima-brengt-uitbuiting-in-kerncentrales-aan-het-licht.dhtml Slave-labor in Japanese nuclear power-plants ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workers in dorms exposed to radiation===
Two shelters for people working at the Fukushima-site were not listed as part of the radiation management zones although radiation levels in the shelters exceeded the legal limits. The consequence was, that the workers did not get paid the extra "danger allowance" that was paid to workers in these "radiation management zones". The shelters were constructed by [[Toshiba Corporation]] and the [[Kajima Corporation]] at a place some 2 kilometers west of the damaged reactors, just outside the plant compound, but quite near to the reactors 1 to 4. The shelters were built after the shelters at the plant-compound became overcrowded. At 7 October 2011 radiation levels in the Toshiba building were between 2 and 16 [[sievert|microsieverts]] per hour, in the Kajima dorm it was 2 to 8.5 microsieverts per hour. The Industrial Safety and Health Law on the prevention of health damage through ionizing radiation had set the limit for accumulated radiation dosage in radiation management zones at 1.3 millisieverts over three months, so the maximum level is 2.6 microsieverts/hour. In both dorms the radiation levels were higher. However, these doses are well below the level to affect human health. According to the law, the "business operator" is responsible for 
"managing radiation dosage and the prevention of contamination", Toshiba and Kajima said that TEPCO was responsible. But a TEPCO official made the comment: "From the perspective of protecting workers from radiation, the business operators (that constructed the shelters) are managing radiation dosage and the prevention of contamination" in this way suggesting that Toshiba and Kajima had to take the care for the zone management.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (31 October 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111031p2a00m0na009000c.html Workers in shelters just outside gates of nuclear complex miss out on allowance]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031184800/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111031p2a00m0na009000c.html |date=October 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preventing hydrogen explosions==
On 26 September 2011, after the discovery of hydrogen in a pipe leading to the containment vessel of reactor no.1, NISA instructed TEPCO to check whether hydrogen was building up in reactor no. 2 and 3 as well. TEPCO announced that measurements of hydrogen would be done in reactor no. 1, before any nitrogen was injected to prevent explosions. When hydrogen would be detected at the other reactors, nitrogen injections would follow.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (26 September 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1317010815P.pdf Earthquake-report 216: Hydrogen check ordered at No.2, 3 reactors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028172841/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1317010815P.pdf |date=2011-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the discovery of hydrogen concentrations between 61 and 63 percent in pipes of the containment of reactor no. 1, nitrogen injections were started on 8 October. On 10 October TEPCO announced, that the concentrations were at that moment low enough to prevent explosions, and even if the concentration would rise again, it would not exceed 4 percent, the lowest level that would pose the risk of an explosion. On the evening of 9 October two holes were drilled into the pipe to install a filter for radioactive substances inside the containment vessel, this was 2 weeks behind the schedule TEPCO had set for itself. This filter should be in operation as soon as possible.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (10 October 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1318217190P.pdf Earthquake-report 230: Hydrogen level falls at Fukushima plant ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106122353/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1318217190P.pdf |date=2011-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations inside the reactors==
On 19 January 2012 the interior of the primary containment vessel of reactor 2 was inspected with an industrial endoscope. This device, 8.5 millimeters in diameter, is equipped with a 360 degrees-view camera and a thermometer to measure the temperature at this spot and the cooling-water inside, in an attempt to calibrate the existing temperature-measurements that could have an error-margin of 20 degrees. The device was brought in by a hole at 2.5 meter above the floor where the vessel is located. The whole procedure lasted 70 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily news (19 January 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120119p2g00m0dm104000c.htm TEPCO uses endoscope to look inside crippled Fukushima reactor ] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120715121104/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120119p2g00m0dm104000c.htm |date=2012-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The photos showed parts of the walls and pipes inside the containment vessel. But they were unclear and blurred, most likely due to water vapors and the radiation inside. According to TEPCO the photos showed no serious damage. The temperature measured inside was 44.7 degrees Celsius, and did not differ much from the 42.6 degrees measured outside the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (20 January 2012)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1327033033P.pdf Earthquake-report 323: TEPCO fails to clearly see inside damaged reactor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516160456/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1327033033P.pdf |date=2013-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;nu.nl (20 January 2012) [http://www.zie.nl/video/algemeen/Tepco-filmt-in-getroffen-kerncentrale/m1fz512f27na TEPCO films in reactor 2 (footage comments in Dutch)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inspections of the suppression chambers reactor no. 2 and 3===
On 14 March 2012 for the first time after the accidents six workers were sent into the basements of reactor no. 2 and 3, to examine the suppression chambers.  Behind the door of suppression chamber in the no.2 building 160 millisieverts/hour was measured. The door to the suppression chamber in the no. 3 reactor building was damaged and could not be opened. In front of this door the radiation level measurement was 75 millisieverts/hour. For reactors to be decommissioned, access to the suppression chambers is vital for conducting repairs to the containment structures. Because the high levels of radiation, according to TEPCO this work should be done with robots, because these places could be hostile to humans. TEPCO released some video footage of the work at the suppression chambers of the No. 2 and 3 reactors.&lt;ref name="www3.nhk.or.jp"&gt;NHK-world (15 March 2012)[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12740843 Radiation high near suppression chambers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JAIF 2012"&gt;JAIF (15 March 2012)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1331791439P.pdf Earthquake report 374: Radiation high near suppression chambers]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 and 27 March 2012 the inside of the containment vessel of reactor 2 was inspected with a 20 meter long endoscope. With this a dosi-meter was brought into the vessel to measure the radiation levels inside. At the bottom of the primary containment structure, 60 centimeters of water was found, instead of the 3 meters expected at that place. The radiation level measured was 72.9 sieverts per hour. Because of this, the endoscope could only function a few hours at this place. For reactors number 1 and 3, no endoscopic survey was planned at that time, because the actual radiation levels at these places were too high for humans.&lt;ref name="www3.nhk.or.jp"/&gt;{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;ref name="JAIF 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (28 March 2012)[https://archive.is/20130221030444/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/national/archive/news/2012/03/28/20120328p2g00m0dm010000c.html Fukushima No. 2 reactor radiation level up to 73 sieverts per hour ] &lt;/ref&gt;

== Management of contaminated water ==
{{Update|section|date=February 2017}}
{{Organize section|date=February 2017}}

Continued cooling of the melted reactor cores is required in order to remove excess heat. Due to damage to the integrity of the reactor vessels, radioactive water accumulated inside the reactor and turbine buildings. To decontaminate the contaminated water, TEPCO installed radioactive water treatment systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/cleantech/tech-companies-to-begin-cleaning-water-at-japan-nuclear-plants/ |title=Tech companies to begin cleaning water at Japan nuclear plants |publisher=Gigaom.com |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese government had initially requested the assistance of the [[Russia]]n floating water decontamination plant ''[[Landysh]]'' to process the radioactive water from the damaged reactors, but negotiations with the Russian government were an extremely slow process and it is unclear if the plant was ever sent to Fukushima. ''Landysh'' was built by Russia with funding from Japan to process liquid wastes produced during the [[nuclear decommissioning|decommissioning]] of [[nuclear submarines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Russia floating nuclear waste plant ready to depart for Japan |url=http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=16134586&amp;PageNum=0 |newspaper=ITAR TASS |date=8 April 2011 |accessdate=11 April 2011}} {{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of early September 2011 the operating rate of the filtering system exceeded the target of 90 percent for the first time. 85,000 tons of water were decontaminated by September 11, with over 100,000 tons of waste-water remaining to be treated at the time. However, the nuclear waste generated by the filters had already filled almost 70 percent of the 800 cubic meters of storage space available at the time. TEPCO had to figure out how to cool the reactors with less than 15 tons of water per day in order to reduce the growth of waste-water and nuclear waste to more manageable levels.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (11 September 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1315713074P.pdf Earthquake-Report 201: Challenges to contain nuclear accident]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Installation of circulating water cooling system ===
[[File:Fukushima I nuclear accident diagram 1.svg|thumb|Side view of the Fukushima trenches and tunnels. 1: Reactor building, 2: Turbine generator and associated condenser.]] 
In order to remove decay heat of the severe damaged cores of Unit 1-3, TEPCO injected cooling water into the reactors. As the reactors appear to have holes around the bottom, the water dissolved the water-soluble fission products, which then accumulated in the basement of the turbine building (the adjacent diagram #2) through any leaks from the water-injected reactor buildings (#1). Since the accumulated radioactive water was a risk, TEPCO tried to transfer it.
[[File:Construction of internationally compatible emergency pump valves for Fukushima complex.jpg|thumb|Assembly of hose fittings for Fukushima complex, Yokota AB]]

As the accumulated water in the basement (see the tunnel below diagram #2) of the turbine building of Units 2 and 3 was radioactive, TEPCO needed to remove it. They had initially planned to pump the water to the condenser (the large black vessel in diagram #1).&lt;ref name="a11"&gt;"Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident Update (27 March, 03:00 UTC)".

=== Removal of accumulated water in seawater piping trench ===
The Fukushima Daiichi NPS has several [[Utility tunnel|seawater piping trenches]] which were originally designed to house pipes and cables running from the Unit 2&amp;ndash;4 turbine buildings to their seaside, which doesn't directly connect to the sea. Inside the trench, radioactive contaminated water has been accumulating since the accident. Due to the risk of soil or ocean contamination from these trenches, TEPCO has been trying to remove the accumulated water in the trenches by pumping it back into the turbine buildings, as well as backfilling the trenches to reduce or prevent further incursion of contaminated water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/decommision/planaction/trench/index-e.html TEPCO:Seawater Piping Trench]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Groundwater contamination===
On 5 July 2013, TEPCO found 9 kBq/L of &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs and 18 kBq/L of &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs in a sample taken from a monitoring well close to the coastline. Compared with samples taken three days earlier, the levels were 90 times higher. The cause was unknown. The monitoring well is situated close to another monitoring well that had previously leaked radioactive water into the sea in April 2011. A sample of groundwater from another well situated about 100 meters south of the first well showed that the radioactivity had risen by 18 times over the course of 4 days, with 1.7 kBq/L of strontium and other radioactive substances.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (08 July 2013) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130709p2g00m0dm075000c.html Groundwater contamination level soars at Fukushima plant]&lt;/ref&gt; A day later the readings in the first well were 11 kBq/L of &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs and 22 kBq/L of &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs, 111 times and 105 times greater than the samples of 5 July. TEPCO did not know the reasons for the higher readings, but the monitoring was to be intensified.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (10 July 2013)[http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130710p2g00m0dm036000c.html Cesium readings further climb in groundwater at Fukushima plant]&lt;/ref&gt;

More than a month after the groundwater contamination was discovered, TEPCO started to contain the radioactive groundwater. They assumed that the radioactivity had escaped early in the beginning of the disaster in 2011, but NRA experts{{who|date=February 2017}} had serious doubts about their assumption. According to them, other sources could not be excluded. Numerous pipes were running everywhere on the reactor grounds to cool the reactors and decontaminate the water used, and leaks could be anywhere. TEPCO's solution resulted in redirection of the groundwater flows, which could have spread the radioactive contamination further. Besides that, TEPCO had plans for pumping groundwater.{{elucidate|date=February 2017}} At that time the turbine buildings of units 2 and 3 contained 5000 and 6000 cubic meters of radioactive water. With wells in contact with the turbine-buildings, this could spread the radioactivity into the ground. The NRA announced that it would form a task force to find the leaks and to block the flow of the groundwater to the coastline, because the NRA suspected that the groundwater was leaking into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (11 July 2013) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130711p2a00m0na010000c.html Radioactive water at Fukushima plant 'strongly suspected' of seeping into sea: NRA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714164622/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130711p2a00m0na010000c.html |date=2013-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Asahi Shimbun (12 July 2013)[http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201307120076 Strontium detected in well on seaward side of Fukushima plant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130716012312/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201307120076 |date=2013-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Asahi Shimbun (13 July 2013) [http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201307130066 TEPCO's plan to halt spread of radioactive water based on shaky theory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717041532/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201307130066 |date=2013-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radioactive waste==
Cooling the reactors with recirculated and decontaminated water from the basements proved to be a success, but as a consequence, this radioactive waste was piling up in the temporary storage facility at the plant. TEPCO decided in the first week of October to use the "Sally" decontamination system built by Toshiba Corporation and keep the Kurion/Areva system as back-up.

On 27 September after three months operation some 4,700 drums with radioactive waste had piled up at the plant. The Kurion and Sally systems both utilized [[zeolite]]s to concentrate cesium. After the zeolite was saturated, the vessels with the zeolite were turned into nuclear waste. By now, 210 Kurion-made vessels with a total of 307 cubic meters, each vessel measuring 0.9 meters in diameter and 2.3 meters in height had accumulated at the plant. The Areva-filters used sand to absorb radioactive materials and chemicals were used to reactivate the filters. In this way, 581 cubic meters of highly contaminated sludge were produced.

According to Professor Akio Koyama of the Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute, the density of high-level decontaminated water was believed to contain 10 gigabecquerel per liter, but if this is condensed to polluted sludge and zeolites, this density could increase 10,000 fold. These densities could not be dealt using conventional systems.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily news (3 October 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111003p2a00m0na011000c.html Radioactive waste piles up at Fukushima nuclear plant as disposal method remains in limbo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005154826/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111003p2a00m0na011000c.html |date=2011-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spent fuel pools===
On August 16, 2011, TEPCO announced the installation of desalination equipment in the spent fuel pools of reactor 2, 3 and 4. These pools had been cooled with seawater for some time, and TEPCO feared the salt would corrode the stainless steel pipes and pool wall liners. The Unit 4 spent fuel pool was the first to have the equipment installed, the spent fuel pools of reactor 2 and 3 came next. TEPCO expected to achieve removal of 96% of the salt in the spent fuel pools within two months.&lt;ref&gt;''Jaif'' (August 16, 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1313555883P.pdf Desalinisation of spent fuel pools ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818045427/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1313555883P.pdf |date=2011-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unit 4 spent fuel removal====
On December 22, 2014, TEPCO crews completed the removal of all fuel assemblies from the spent fuel pool of reactor 4. 1331 spent fuel assemblies were moved to the ground-level common spent fuel pool, and 204 unused fuel assemblies were moved to the spent fuel pool of reactor 6 (Unit 4 was out of service for refueling at the time of the 2011 accident, so the spent fuel pool contained a number of unused new fuel assemblies).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/2014/1246703_5892.html |title=FUEL REMOVAL FROM UNIT 4 REACTOR BUILDING COMPLETED AT FUKUSHIMA DAIICHI |publisher=www.tepco.co.jp |accessdate=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 April 2011, TEPCO began using remote-controlled, unmanned heavy equipment to remove debris from around reactors 1–4. The debris and rubble, caused by hydrogen explosions at reactors 1 and 3, was impeding recovery operations both by being in the way and emitting high radioactivity. The debris will be placed into containers and kept at the plant.&lt;ref&gt;''NHK'', "TEPCO Uses Unmanned Equipment To Remove Rubble", 10 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed building protections==
{{update|section|date=August 2011}}

Because the [[monsoon]] season begins in June in Japan, it became urgent to protect the damaged reactor buildings from [[storm]]s, [[typhoon]]s and heavy rainfall. As a short term solution, TEPCO envisaged to apply a light cover on the remaining structures above the damaged reactors.  As of mid-June, TEPCO released its plan to use automated cranes to move structures into place over the reactor.  This strategy is an attempt to keep as many people away from the reactors as possible, while still covering the damaged reactors.&lt;ref name="The Guardian Newspapaer"&gt;{{cite news|title=TEPCO unveils plan to seal Fukushima reactors|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2011/jun/15/tepco-plan-seal-fukushima-reactors-video|accessdate=6 August 2011 | location=London|work=The Guardian|date=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proposed Sarcophagus ===
On 18 March, Reuters reported&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Saoshiro, Shinichi |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/03/18/us-japan-fortimeline-march-idUKTRE72H5TG20110318|title=Japan weighs need to bury nuclear plant; tries to restore power |agency=Reuters |date=18 March 2011|accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Hidehiko Nishiyama, Japan's nuclear agency spokesman when asked about burying the reactors in sand and concrete, said: "That solution is in the back of our minds, but we are focused on cooling the reactors down." Considered a last-ditch effort since it would not provide cooling, such a plan would require massive reinforcement under the floor, as for the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/8392154/Japan-nuclear-crisis-scientists-consider-burying-Fukushima-in-a-Chernobyl-sarcophagus.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|author=Alleyne, Richard|title=Japan nuclear crisis: scientists consider burying Fukushima in a 'Chernobyl sarcophagus'|date=19 March 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scrapping reactor Daiichi 1, 2, 3, 4===
On 7 September 2011, TEPCO president Toshio Nishizawa said that the 4 damaged reactors will be scrapped. This announcement came at a session of the Fukushima Prefectural Assembly, which was investigating the accident at the plant. Whether the six other remaining reactors, (Daiichi 5, 6, Daini 1, 2, 3, 4) should be abolished too, would be decided based on the opinions of local municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (7 September 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1315463095P.pdf Nishizawa:TEPCO to scrap Fukushima reactors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419005430/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1315463095P.pdf |date=2012-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


On 28 October 2011, the [[Japanese Atomic Energy Commission]] presented a timetable in a draft report titled, ''“how to scrap the Fukushima reactors”''. Within 10 years, a start should be made with the retrieval of the melted fuel within the reactors. First, the containment vessels of reactors 1, 2 and 3 should be repaired, then all should be filled with water to prevent radiation releases. Decommissioning would take more than 30 years, because the pressure vessels of the reactor vessels are damaged also. After the [[Three Mile Island accident|accident at Three Mile Island]] in 1979, some 70 percent of the fuel rods had melted. There, the retrieval of the fuel was started in 1985, and completed in 1990. The work at Fukushima was expected to take significantly longer because of the far greater damage and the fact that 4 reactors would need to be decommissioned all at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (28 October 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/28_31.html Fuel retrieval at Fukushima to start in 10 years ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028184804/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/28_31.html |date=2011-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (29 October 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1319860744P.pdf Earthquake-report 249: Fuel retrieval at Fukushima to start in 10 years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517073954/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1319860744P.pdf |date=2013-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After discussions were started in August 2011, on 9 November, a panel of experts of Japan's Atomic Energy Commission completed a schedule for scrapping the damaged reactors - their conclusions were;

* The scrapping will take 30 years or longer.
* First, the containment vessels needed to be repaired, then filled with water to block radiation.
* The reactors should be in a state of stable cold shutdown.
* Three years later, a start would be made to take all spent fuel from the 4 damaged reactors to a pool within the compound.
* Within 10 years, the removal of the melted fuel inside the reactors could begin.

This scheme was partly based on the experience gained from the 1979 Three Mile Island accident. However, in Fukushima with three meltdowns at one site, the damage was much more extensive. It could take 30 years or more to remove the nuclear fuel, dismantle the reactors, and remove all the buildings.
Research institutions all over the world were asked to participate in the construction of a research-site to examine the removal of fuel and other nuclear wastes. The official publication of the report was planned at the end of 2011.&lt;ref name="Earthquake-report 261"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NHK-world 2011"&gt;NHK-world (9 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/09_28.html Commission releases report on scrapping N-plant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213203958/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/09_28.html |date=2011-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protection systems installed==
Since the disaster, TEPCO has installed sensors, a fabric cover over the reactors and additional filters to reduce the emission of contaminants.

===Sensors for xenon and temperature changes to detect critical reactions===
After the detection of radioactive xenon gas in the containment vessel of the No. 2 reactor on 1 and 2 November 2011 TEPCO was not able to determine whether this was a sustained fission process or only spontaneous fission. Therefore TEPCO installed detection devices for radioactive xenon to single out any occurrence of nuclear criticality. Next to this TEPCO installed temperature sensors to control temperature changes in the reactors, another indicator of possible critical fission reactions.&lt;ref name="Earthquake-report 261"&gt;JAIF (10 November 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1320900681P.pdf Earthquake-report 261]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (10 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/10_14.html TEPCO to monitor xenon at Fukushima plant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112193829/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/10_14.html |date=2011-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New filters===
On 20 September the Japanese government and TEPCO announced the installation of new filters to reduce the amount of radioactive substances released into the air. In the last week of September 2011 these filters were to be installed at reactor 1, 2 and 3. Gases out of the reactors would be decontaminated before they would be released into the air. Mid October the construction of the polyester shield over the No.1 reactor should be completed. In the first half of September the amount of radioactive substances released from the plant was about 200 megabecquerel per hour, according to TEPCO, that was about one-four millionths of the level of the initial stages of the accident in March.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Fabric cover over Unit 1===
An effort has been undertaken to fit the three damaged reactor buildings with fabric covers and filters to limit radioactive contamination release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/03/31/3178263.htm|title=Reactor feared in meltdown, radiation spreads|publisher=ABC News|date=30 March 2011|accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 April 2011, sources told Kyodo News that a major construction firm was studying the idea, and that construction wouldn't "start until June". The plan has been criticized for potential only having "limited effects in blocking the release of radioactive substances into the environment".&lt;ref name="kyodonews4"&gt;[http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2011/04/83374.html Radiation-shielding sheets to be installed in September at earliest, Kyodo News]. English.kyodonews.jp. Retrieved on 30 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May, TEPCO announced that it had begun to clear debris to create a space to install a cover over the building of reactor 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/14_02.html |title=TEPCO to cover No.1 reactor building |publisher=NHK |date=14 May 2011 |accessdate=2 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513220611/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/14_02.html |archivedate=May 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, a large crane was erected near Reactor 1 to begin construction of the fabric cover. From mid August to mid September 2011, a rectangular steel frame entirely surrounding the reactor building was constructed. Starting 9 September, the crane was used to attach polyester panels to the frame. On 20 September 2011, TEPCO announced that within three weeks they hoped to complete the construction of the polyester shield over the No.1 reactor. By that time the steel frame for the fabric cover had been completed. By 7 October, the roof of the structure was being added. On 9 October, the walls of the cover appeared to be placed, and by 13 October the roof had been completed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;JAIF (20 September 2011 [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1316578041P.pdf Earthquake-report 211: A new plan set to reduce radiation emissions ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Based on archived video of the plant from TEPCO&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (20 September 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1316481545P.pdf Steel Frame for Unit 1 Reactor Building Cover is Complete] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419005604/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1316481545P.pdf |date=2012-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metal cover over Unit 3===
In June 2016, preparation work began to install a metal cover over the Unit 3 reactor building. In conjunction with this, a crane is to be installed to assist with the removal of the fuel rods from the storage pool. After inspection and cleaning, the removed fuel is expected to be stored in the site's communal storage facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-Test-run-for-Fukushima-Daiichi-3-cover-installation-1306164.html|title=Test run for Fukushima Daiichi 3 cover installation|publisher=World Nuclear News|date=13 June 2016|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2018 the dome-shaped roof had been completed in preparation of the removal of the fuel rods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20180221_19/ |author= |title=Kukushima plant reactor gets new roof cover| publisher=NHK Newsline |date=February 20, 2018 |accessdate=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup of neighboring areas==
Significant efforts are being taken to clean up radioactive material that escaped the plant. This effort combines washing down buildings and scraping away topsoil. It has been hampered by the volume of material to be removed and the lack of adequate storage facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110827p2a00m0na013000c.html Hot-spot cleanups hampered by public resistance to local disposal sites - The Mainichi Daily News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827224801/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110827p2a00m0na013000c.html |date=August 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a concern that washing surfaces will merely move the radioactive material without eliminating it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110827p2a00m0na012000c.html No quick way to remove radioactive substances from soil: experts - The Mainichi Daily News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827224803/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110827p2a00m0na012000c.html |date=August 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an earlier decontamination-plan only to clean all areas with radiation levels above 5 millisievert per year, had raised protests, the Japanese government revealed, on 10 October 2011, in a meeting with experts, a revised decontamination plan. This plan included:
* all areas with radiation levels above 1 millisievert per year would be cleaned.
* no-entry zones and evacuation zones designated by the government would be the responsibility of the government.
* the rest of the areas would be cleaned by local authorities.
* in areas with radiation levels above 20 millisievert per year, decontamination would be done step by step.
* within two years, radiation levels between 5 and 20 millisieverts should be cut down to 60%.
* the Japanese government would help local authorities with disposing the enormous amount of radioactive waste.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (10 October 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1318301925P.pdf Earthquake-report 231: Decontamination-plan compiled] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106113804/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1318301925P.pdf |date=2011-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 2011 the Japanese Ministry of Environment published more details about these plans for decontamination: the work would be subsidized in 102 villages and towns. Opposition against the plan came from cattle-farmers in the prefecture [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]] and the tourist-industry in the city of [[Aizuwakamatsu]], because of fears that cattle sales might drop or tourism would be hurt to the town, when the areas would be labeled to be contaminated. Areas with lower readings complained that their decontamination would not be funded.&lt;ref&gt;JAIF (20 December 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1324357922P.pdf Earthquake report 296: Govt to designate nuclear clean-up areas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103225504/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1324357922P.pdf |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Reuters story from August 2013, it was noted "[m]any have given up hope of ever returning to live in the shadow of the Fukushima nuclear plant. A survey in June showed that a third of the former residents of Iitate, a lush village famed for its fresh produce before the disaster, never want to move back. Half of those said they would prefer to be compensated enough to move elsewhere in Japan to farm." In addition, despite being allowed to return home, some residents say the lack of an economy continues to make the area de facto unlivable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Knight |first=Sophie |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/08/14/japan-decontamination-fukushima-idINDEE97D0G220130814 |title=Japan's nuclear clean-up: costly, complex and at risk of failing &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=In.reuters.com |date= 14 August 2013|accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compensation payments to those who have been evacuated are stopped when they are allowed to return home, however, as of August 2013 decontamination of the area has progressed more slowly than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130808p2a00m0na013000c.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130821145939/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130808p2a00m0na013000c.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 21, 2013 |accessdate=August 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been revelations of additional leaks (see above: storage tanks leaking contaminated water).

===Cementing the seabed near the water-intake===
On 22 February 2012 TEPCO started cementing the seabed near the plant to prevent the spread of radioactive materials into the sea. Some 70000 square meters of seabed around the intake of cooling water would be covered with 60 centimeters thick cement. The work should be finished within 4 months time, and prevent the spread of contaminated mud and sand at that place for at least 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;NHK-world (22 February 2012)[http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/society.html Seabed near nuke plant to be covered with cement]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127083730/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/society.html |date=November 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New definition of the no-entry-zones introduced===
On 18 December 2011 Fukushima Gov. Yuhei Sato and representatives of 11 other municipal governments near the plant were notified at a meeting at the city of Fukushima the three ministers in charge of handling the crises, Yokio Edano, minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, Goshi Hosono, nuclear disaster minister, and Tatsuo Hirano, minister in charge of reconstruction of the government plan to redesign the classification of the no-entry-zones around the Fukushima nuclear plant. From 1 April 2012 a three level system would be introduced, by the Japanese government:

a) no-entry zones, with an annual radiation exposure of 50 millisieverts or more
: at these places habitation would be prohibited
b) zones with annual radiation exposures between 20-50 millisievert, 
: here former residents could return, but with restrictions.
c) zones with exposures of less than 20 millisievert per year
: in these zones the residents would be allowed to return to their houses.

Decontamination efforts were planned in line with this newly designed order, to help the people to return to places where the radiation levels would be relatively low.&lt;ref&gt;The Daily Yomiuri (18 December 2011) [https://archive.is/20130218155931/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T111217003401.htm Govt speeds rezoning of contaminated areas] &lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs of the clean-up operations===
Mid December 2011 the local authorities in [[Fukushima prefecture|Fukushima]] had spent already around 1.7 billion yen ($21 million) on the costs of decontamination-works in the cities of [[Fukushima, Fukushima|Fukushima]] and [[Date, Fukushima|Date]] and the village of [[Kawauchi, Fukushima|Kawauchi]]. The total clean-up costs were estimated around 420 billion yen (~ $5.2 billion).{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} For the clean-up only 184.3 billion yen was reserved in the September supplementary budget of prefecture Fukushima, and some funds in the central government's third supplementary budget of 2011. Whenever needed the central government would be asked for extra funding.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Daily News (21 December 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111221p2a00m0na017000c.html Fukushima local decontamination costs bust estimates]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221193028/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111221p2a00m0na017000c.html |date=December 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[University of Oxford]] researcher and author Peter Wynn Kirby wrote that the government had allocated the equivalent of US$15 billion for the regional cleanup and described the josen (decontamination) process, with "provisional storage areas (kari-kari-okiba) ... [and] more secure, though still temporary, storage depots (kari-okiba)". Kirby opined the effort still would be better called "transcontamination" because it was moving the contaminated material around without long-term safe storage planned or executed. He also saw little progress on handling the more intense radiation waste of the destroyed power-plant site itself; or on handling the larger issue of the national nuclear program's waste, particularly given the earthquake-risk of Japan relative to secure long-term storage.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, Peter Wynn, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/08/opinion/playing-pass-the-parcel-with-fukushima.html "Playing Pass the Parcel With Fukushima"], New York ''Times'' [[OpEd]], March 7, 2016. Retrieved 2016-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lessons learned to date==
The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster revealed the dangers of building multiple nuclear reactor units close to one another. This proximity triggered the parallel, chain-reaction accidents that led to hydrogen explosions blowing the roofs off reactor buildings and water evaporating from open-air [[spent fuel pool]]s—a situation that was potentially more dangerous than the loss of reactor cooling itself. Because of the proximity of the reactors, Plant Director Masao Yoshida "was put in the position of trying to cope simultaneously with core meltdowns at three reactors and exposed fuel pools at three units".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/02/29/0096340212440359.full.pdf+html |title=Fukushima in review: A complex disaster, a disastrous response |author=Yoichi Funabashi and Kay Kitazawa |date=March 1, 2012 |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8620">'''GPS/INS''' is the use of [[GPS]] satellite signals to correct or calibrate a solution from an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS). The method is applicable for any GNSS/INS system.

== Overview ==
=== Problem ===
Inertial navigation systems usually can provide an accurate solution only for a short period of time. The INS accelerometers produce an unknown bias signal that appears as a genuine specific force. This is acceleration integrated twice against time and thus produces an error in position. Additionally, the INS software must use an estimate of the angular position of the accelerometers when conducting this integration. Typically, the angular position is tracked through an integration of the angular rate from the gyro sensors. These also produce unknown biases that affect the integration to get the position of the unit. 

=== GPS/INS method ===
The GPS gives an absolute drift-free position value that can be used to reset the INS solution or can be blended with it by use of a mathematical algorithm, such as a [[Kalman filter]]. The angular orientation of the unit can be inferred from the series of position updates from the GPS. The change in the error in position relative to the GPS can be used to estimate the unknown angle error.

The benefits of using GPS with an INS are that the INS may be calibrated by the GPS signals and that the INS can provide position and angle updates at a quicker rate than GPS. For high dynamic vehicles, such as missiles and aircraft, INS fills in the gaps between GPS positions. Additionally, GPS may lose its signal and the INS can continue to compute the position and angle during the period of lost GPS signal. The two systems are complementary and are often employed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grewal|first=M.

== Applications ==
GPS/INS is commonly used on aircraft for navigation purposes. Using GPS/INS allows for smoother position and velocity estimates that can be provided at a sampling rate faster than the GPS receiver.  This also allows for accurate estimation of the aircraft attitude (roll, pitch, and yaw) {{citation needed|reason=GPS wont provide attitude that easily, only position/velocity|date=May 2016}} angles.  In general, GPS/INS sensor fusion is a nonlinear filtering problem, which is commonly approached using the [[extended Kalman filter]] (EKF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kalman|first=R. E.|author2=R.

The '''German Protestant Institute of Archaeology (GPIA), Research Unit of the German Archaeological Institute''', founded in 1900 is one of the most important biblical archaeological institutes in the Near East. Its [[German language|German]] name is ''Deutsches Evangelisches Institut für Altertumswissenschaft des Heiligen Landes''.

== Institutes ==
The German Protestant Institute of Archaeology, Research Unit of the German Archaeological Institute, operates in two locations – [[Jerusalem]] and [[Amman]]. Its high reputation as cultural institution, help desk, and meeting place for European scholars makes it a sought-after partner for cooperation between German and international organizations and projects. The GPIA is a foundation administered by the [[German Protestant Church]]. At the same time, it serves as a research unit of the [[German Archaeological Institute]] (DAI). They cooperate in several archaeological projects.

* Institute [[Jerusalem]],
Director-General: Professor Dr. Dr. Dr. h.c. [[Dieter Vieweger]]&lt;br /&gt;
Address: Auguste-Victoria-Compound, P.O.Box 18 463, Jerusalem 91184&lt;br /&gt;
- Archaeological library, archaeological museum

* Institute [[Amman]],
Director: Dr. Jutta Häser&lt;br /&gt;
Address: P.O.Box 183, Amman 11118, Jordan&lt;br /&gt;
- Archaeological library, archaeological collection

== Aims ==
The mission of the institute was clearly stated in its founding charter: the exploration of the Holy Land and its diverse past, cultures and religions. The knowledge acquired was meant to be available to, and discussed by, both experts and the general public. In light of this founding mission, the institute undertakes research on the history and culture of the region. To this end, the institute conducts its own excavations and supports other German research projects.

The institute is also committed to disseminating the results of research, especially in the areas of archaeology, cultural studies, theology and the Church. For this purpose, the institute maintains a research library, issues its own archaeological journal and organises meetings, lecture series and exhibitions. Especially important is the Course Programme for theologians, which was founded over 100 years ago by the first director, [[Gustaf Dalman]]. The institute also tries to make archaeological knowledge available to the public by offering guided tours of Jerusalem and the surrounding area.

The GPIA fosters close relations with the cultural institutions in the host countries and supports scientific research without any political or religious borders on both sides of the river Jordan.

== Archaeological projects ==

=== Tall Zira'a and the Gadara Region Project (Jordan) ===
Together with the [[Biblical Archaeological Institute]] in [[Wuppertal]], the GPIA conducts the [[Gadara Region Project]] (2001–2020) in the Wadi al-'Arab, south of Umm Qais. The central archaeological site of the Wadi al-'Arab is the [[Tall Zira'a]].
There is hardly an area of Palestine where its history can be studied in such a concentrated manner as in the Wadi al-'Arab. This deep valley, which lies roughly five kilometres south-west of the ancient [[Decapolis]] city of Gadara (today [[Umm Qais]]), is, in many ways, an archaeological bonanza due to the variety in what it has to offer. A number of springs, fertile soils and a moderate climate all provide for excellent living conditions, and the most imposing hill in the valley, Tall Zira'a, possesses its own artesian spring and the very best potential for settlement.

In addition, an important trade route ran through the wadi which once linked Egypt with Mesopotamia. The economic success and industriousness of the wadi's inhabitants have left plenty of traces over the millennia. Over one hundred sites mark out the distinguished history of human settlement in the region from the advent of sedentism to the Islamic period. Settlements, canals, water mills, cisterns, oil presses, wine presses, watch towers, graves and, above all, Tall Zira'a with its over 5000 years of settlement activity.

=== The archaeological park below the Church of the Redeemer (Jerusalem) ===
The archaeological park opened in November 2012 "The Times", located below the nave of the Church of the Redeemer was co-developed by German Protestant Institute (GPIA) and offers the possibility to commit more than 2000 years of history of the city of Jerusalem by walking through it.

The archaeological excavations, conducted by [[Conrad Schick]] 1893 und Ute Wagner-Lux (the former director of GPIA) respectively Karl Vriezen 1970–1974, have been prepared by the German Protestant Institute in the Holy Land in 2009–2012 to present visitors the different stages of development and building of Jerusalem.

=== Former projects ===
* Ute Wagner-Lux – [[Madaba]] / [[Jerusalem]] / [[Gadara]],
* August Strobel – Kallirrhoë (En ez-Zara),
* Gunnar Lehmann; Martin Peilstöcker – Plain of [[Akko]],
* Volkmar Fritz – Tell el-Oreme,
* Susanne Kerner – [[Gadara Aqueduct|Gadara Tunnel System]]
* Thomas Weber – Gadara
* Hans-Dieter Bienert; Dieter Vieweger – Esh-Shallaf near Irbid,
* Hans-Dieter Bienert; Dieter Vieweger; Roland Lamprichs – Baja near [[Petra]],
* Roland Lamprichs – Tall Johfieh,
* Michael Heinzelmann – [[Hippos]].

==History==
The GPIA was founded on June 19, 1900, by the Deutsche Evangelische Kirchenkonferenz in Eisenach in order to "maintain, further and regulate the relations between the holy places of biblical history, on the one hand, and between the scientific inquiry and the interests of the Christian faith of the Protestant Church, on the other, in the fields of biblical and ecclesiastical archaeology."

Gustaf Dalman – then Professor of Old Testament and Judaic Studies at the [[University of Leipzig]] – was appointed first director and built up the Jerusalem institute. The changed situation after the [[Six-Day War]] in June 1967 necessitated the establishment of the Amman institute. In 1982, the institute in Jerusalem moved to new buildings at the Auguste-Victoria-Compound on the [[Mount of Olives]].

Contemporary rhetoric focuses on cultural contexts and general structures of rhetoric structures. [[Kenneth Burke]] is one of the most notable contemporary U.S. rhetoricians who made major contributions to the rhetoric of identification. One of his most foundational ideas is as follows, “rhetoric makes human unity possible, that language use is symbolic action, and that rhetoric is symbolic inducement.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction|last=Herrick|first=James A.|publisher=Allyn Bacon|year=2012|isbn=978-0205078585|location=New York|pages=10, 225–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branching from this, Herrick states that identification in rhetoric is crucial to persuasion, and thus to cooperation, consensus, compromise, and action. Burke believed that the most serious human problem was to be alienated or separated, and rhetoric was to be that problem’s only solution. Much of his work was based on bringing people back together. “Identification is affirmed with earnestness precisely because there is division. Identification is compensatory to division.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Rhetoric’s goal, in regards to identification, is to bring people together of whom have been separated by estrangement or opposition.

==History==
Kenneth Burke plays an important part in learning and understanding the core values of rhetorical theory in identification. He introduces the notion by taking the Aristotelian approach into a "world of particulars." Burke states that [[Aristotle]] treated rhetoric as purely verbal. But there are also areas of overlap. The flexibility of identification that Burke has created expands into elements beyond language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Keith|date=2006|title=Burke, Frazer, and Ritual: Attitudes toward Attitudes|url=http://kbjournal.org/gibson|journal=KB Journal|volume=3|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke wrote that “identification ranges from the politician who, addressing an audience of farmers, says, ‘I was a farm boy myself,’ through the mysteries of social status, to the mystic’s devout identification with the source of all being.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This symbolic interaction is possible because it recognizes the hidden sources of identification among human beings as symbol users. From this, Burke understands symbols as something that is around constantly, and that choosing to accept and learning to read them accurately is what needs to be understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rutton|first=Kris|last2=Soetaert|first2=Ronald|date=2014|title=A Rhetoric of Turns: Signs and Symbols in Education|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9752.12081/full|journal=Journal of Philosophy of Education|volume=48|pages=604–620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Burke’s theory of identification has been applied and expanded upon in [[Rhetoric|Krista Ratcliff&lt;nowiki/&gt;e]]’s Rhetorical Listening Framework. Ratcliffe proposes the “blurring of Burke’s and Fuss’s theories of identification, what becomes visible is multiple places for rhetorical listening.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Listening: Identification, Gender, Whiteness|last=Ratcliffe|first=Krista|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|year=|isbn=0-8093-2669-8|location=|pages=69, 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When applying Burke and Fuss’s theories, Ratcliffe proposes non-identification in cross-cultural communication and feminist [[pedagogy]]. Her critique of Western logic is that it is difficult to simultaneously pay attention to both commonalities and differences, but that is where non-identification exists and thus provides a place for rhetorical listening.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Burke’s theory is critiqued by Ratcliffe for only focusing on identification; she argues that rhetorical listeners need to be accountable and take into consideration different points of view, which can be done through simultaneous listening to commonalities and differences.

Ratcliffe draws upon Diane Fuss because Fuss expands Burke’s theory of identification to gear toward examining the differences in identificaion. Fuss defines Identification as related to the issue of connection between opposite entities, such as the interrelation between self and other, subject and object, and insiders and outsiders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For Fuss, identification is difficult to pinpoint, as the distinction between opposite entities is porous, oftentimes “impossibly confused and finally untenable.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fuss further builds the connection between identification and disidentification.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fuss defines disidentification as contingent on previous identification with another group, no matter how stereotypical the identification is, while at the same time the identification has receded from the subconscious.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ratcliffe argues that previously identification has been configured as a metaphor, which is manifested in Burke’s [[Identification in Burkean rhetoric|consubstantiality]] and Fuss’s (dis)identification. Ratcliffe notes that metaphor has been used to function as the dominant trope for identification; however, metaphor foregrounds commonalities more than differences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ratcliff suggests theorizing identification via the use of metonymy to counter the privilege of communality. Intrinsic to the trope of [[metonymy]] is an attention to both commonalities and differences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Practical applications of Burke’s “identification” can be seen in the scholarly effort to reframe identifications. Assembling essays from the fifth Biennial Rhetoric Society of America Conference, Michelle Ballif addresses Ratcliffe’s call for rethinking Burke’s notion of identification “as a place of perpetual reframing that affects who, how, and what can be thought, spoken, written, and imagined.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Re/Framing Identification|last=Ballif|first=Michelle|publisher=Waveland|year=2014|isbn=9781478606710|location=Long Grove|pages=1, 200, 309}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some of the essay contributors draw upon Burke’s theory to reinterpret social identifications, others turn to specific social actions to reread Burke’s “identification.” For instance, following Ratcliffe’s critique of Burke’s theory for its lack of attention to difference, Dominic J. Ashby destabilizes Burke’s relatively fixed and teleological construction of identification with “a fluid and contingent notion of self”—that is, “uchi/soto,"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or inside/outside in Japanese rhetoric—highlighting a simultaneous exclusion and inclusion of outsiders through an ongoing unfolding of group dynamics. By way of analyzing the Facebook news feed of “We are all Khaled Said,” Katherine Bridgman expands Burkean identification to “embodiment,”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or the mutually coordinated experience between speakers and their audiences triggered by specific circumstances. Along a similar vein, critiquing Burke’s [[Identification in Burkean rhetoric|consubstantiality]] for being sexually indifferent, Janice Odom draws from Irigaray’s feminist theories to reframe identification as a playground of sexual dominance and surrender.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4774">'''Inner-worldly asceticism''' was characterized by [[Max Weber]] in ''[[Economy and Society]]'' as the concentration of human behavior upon activities leading to salvation within the context of the everyday world.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Elton, ''Reformation Europe'' (1969) p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

He saw it as a prime influence in the emergence of [[modernity]] and the technological world,&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (1972) p. 14 and p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; a point developed in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''.

==Four-fold typology==

Weber's [[Ideal type|typology]] of religion set off the distinction between asceticism and [[mysticism]] against that between inner-worldly and other-worldly orientations, to produce a four-fold set of religious types.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talcott Parsons]], Introduction, Max Weber, ''The Sociology of Religion'' (1971) p. li&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pawel Stefan Zaleski "Ideal Types in Max Weber’s Sociology of Religion: Some Theoretical Inspirations for a Study of the Religious Field", ''Polish Sociological Review'' No. 3(171)/2010&lt;/ref&gt; According to Talcott Parsons, otherwordly stances provided no leverage upon socio-economic problems, and inner-worldly mystics attached no significance to the material world surrounding them,&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. li-lii&lt;/ref&gt; the inner-worldly ascetic acted within the institutions of the world, while being opposed to them, and as an instrument of God. However Stefan Zaleski showed that inner-worldly mysticism that is magic was interested in active transformation of reality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In religions which can be characterized by inner-world-asceticim, the world appears to the religious virtuoso as his responsibility.&lt;ref name="weber_asceticism"&gt;Weber, Max. "Asceticism, Mysticism and Salvation." In ''Economy and society; an outline of interpretive sociology''.. New York: Bedminster Press, 1968. 542.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationalism==

For Weber, the worldly ascetic is a rationalist. He rationalizes his own conduct but also rejects conduct which is specifically irrational, esthetic, or dependent upon his own emotional reactions to the world.&lt;ref name="weber_asceticism2"&gt;Weber, Max. "Asceticism, Mysticism and Salvation." In ''Economy and society; an outline of interpretive sociology''.. New York: Bedminster Press, 1968. 544.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inner-worldly asceticism, including above all [[Protestantism]], taught the fulfillment of obligations in the world as the sole method of proving religious merit. Its emphasis on the importance of one's [[Vocation|calling]] encouraged the differentiation of life-spheres, while its rationality favoured an emphasis on [[natural law]]&lt;ref&gt;David Owen, ''Maturity and Modernity'' (1994) p. 11-7&lt;/ref&gt; – further aspects enhancing the impact Weber postulated such asceticism had upon the development of [[capitalism]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 528&lt;/ref&gt; or rather the particular type of capitalism Weber saw as marked by "the rational organization and institutionalization of social relationships...rational bourgeois capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;Weber, ''Sociology'' p. 183 and p. lix&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

* Critics have challenged the validity of Weber's linking of Calvinism, and predestination in particular, with the emergence of the capitalist spirit;&lt;ref&gt;Guy Oakes, 'The Thing That Would Not Die: Notes on Refutation' in H. Lehman/G. Roth eds, ''Weber's Protestant Ethic'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as disputing more generally any inherent or correlative link between Protestantism and capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Elton, p. 312-8&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Postmodernism]] in its repudiation of [[metanarratives]]&lt;ref&gt;R. Appiganesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; has rejected Weber's theory as one (Eurocentric) aspect of such grand tales;&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Fredric Jameson]] sees it as illuminating at least one facet of the bourgeois cultural revolution&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks, ''The Jameson Reader'' (2005) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;—the psycho-sociological transformation that accompanied the move from [[Traditional society|traditional]] [[agrarian society]] to the modern urban world-system.

{{Christian Democracy sidebar |expanded=all}}
[[Jacques Maritain]], the French Catholic philosopher and author of over 60 books, advocated what he called "Integral Christian Humanism". He argued that [[secular]] forms of [[humanism]] were inevitably anti-human in that they refused to recognize the whole person.

Once the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] dimension of [[human]] nature is rejected, Maritain has argued that we no longer have an integral, but merely partial, humanism, one which rejects a fundamental aspect of the human person. Accordingly, in Integral Humanism he explores the prospects for a new [[Christendom]], rooted in his philosophical pluralism, in order to find ways [[Christianity]] could inform political discourse and policy in a pluralistic age. In this account he develops a theory of cooperation, to show how people of different intellectual positions can nevertheless cooperate to achieve common practical aims. [[Maritain]]'s political theory was extremely influential, and was a primary source behind the [[Christian democracy|Christian Democratic]] movement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5400">'''KWIC''' is an acronym for '''Key Word In Context''', the most common format for [[concordance (publishing)|concordance]] lines. The term KWIC was first coined by [[Hans Peter Luhn]].&lt;ref&gt;Manning, C. D., Schütze, H.: "Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing", p.35. The MIT Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The system was based on a concept called ''keyword in titles'' which was first proposed for Manchester libraries in 1864 by [[Andrea Crestadoro]].&lt;ref name="index"&gt;{{cite book|title=Advanced Indexing and Abstracting Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIUkl7bLzYUC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=Andrea+Crestadoro#v=onepage&amp;q=Andrea%20Crestadoro&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''KWIC''' index is formed by sorting and aligning the words within an article title to allow each word (except the [[stop words]]) in titles to be searchable alphabetically in the index.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.janda.org/workshop/content%20analysis/kwic.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It was a useful indexing method for technical manuals before computerized [[full text search]] became common.

For example, a search query including all of the words in the title statement of this article ("KWIC is an acronym for Key Word In Context, the most common format for concordance lines") and the [[Wikipedia:Slogans|Wikipedia slogan]] in English ("the free encyclopedia"), searched against this very web page, might yield a KWIC index as follows. A KWIC index usually uses a wide layout to allow the display of maximum 'in context' information (not shown in the following example).

A KWIC index is a special case of a ''permuted index''.&lt;ref&gt;http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/lang/python/examples/kwic/web/theory.html&lt;/ref&gt; This term refers to the fact that it indexes all [[cyclic permutation]]s of the headings. Books composed of many short sections with their own descriptive headings, most notably collections of [[Manual page (Unix)|manual pages]], often ended with a '''permuted index''' section, allowing the reader to easily find a section by any word from its heading. This practice, also known as '''KWOC''' (“'''Key Word Out of Context'''”), is no longer common.

This format is extremely useful in that the keyword is easily identified together with its context. ... The Concordance of the Roman Missal is produced in both the KWIC and KWICn formats and is noteworthy in that each word form is listed as it appears in the text, that is, it is un-lemmatized."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4560">'''Meristics''' is an area of [[ichthyology]] which relates to counting quantitative features of [[fish]], such as the number of fins or scales.  A '''meristic''' (countable trait) can be used to describe a particular [[species]] of fish, or used to identify an unknown species.  Meristic traits are often described in a shorthand notation called a ''meristic formula''.

Meristic characters are the countable structures occurring in series (e.g. [[myomere]]s, [[vertebrae]], [[fin ray]]s) in fish. These characters are among the characters most commonly used for [[wikt:differentiation|differentiation]] of [[species]] and [[populations]]. In the [[salmonids]], scale counts have been most widely used for the differentiation of populations within species. In rainbow and steelhead [[trout]] the most notable differences among populations occur in counts of scales.

Meristic characters are used in many other fields, such as in [[botany]] or in [[zoology]]. Meristic comparison is used in [[phenetic]] and [[cladistic]] analysis.

==Meristic analysis==
A meristic study is often a difficult task, as counting the features of a fish is not as easy as it may appear. Many meristic analyses are performed on dead fish that have been [[Fixation (histology)|preserved]] in alcohol. Meristic traits are less easily observed on living fish, though it is possible. On very small fish, a microscope may be required.

Ichthyologists follow a basic set of rules when performing a meristic analysis, to remove as much ambiguity as possible. The specific practice, however, may vary depending on the type of fish. The methodology for counting meristic traits should be described by the specialist who performs the analysis.

==Meristic formula==
This a shorthand method of describing the way the bones (rays) of a bony fish's fins are arranged, comparable to the [[flower#Floral_formula|floral formula]] for flowers.

Spine counts are given in Roman numerals, e.g. XI-XIV. Ray counts are given in Arabic numerals, e.g. 11-14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=ray&amp;language=english&amp;sc=is|title=System glossary: ray|work=Fishbase|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meristic formula of the [[dusky spinefoot]] (''Siganus luridus'') is: D, XIV+10; A, VII+8-9; P, 16-17; V, I+3+I; GR, 18-22 

This means the fish has 14 spiny rays (bones) in the first part of its dorsal fin (D), followed by 10 soft rays. A means the Anal fin, P means Pectoral (fins near the gills and eyes where 'arms' would be), V are the ventral or pelvic fins (equivalent to 'legs') C represents the caudal (tail), not indicated in this example. GR is gill raker count (see below)

==Vertebral counts==
The number of bones in the backbone is a feature which can also be used to classify fish species. Usually all the [[vertebrae]] are counted. Vertebral counts may be split into abdominal (those associated with the body cavity) and caudal (tail) vertebrae. If there are sutures in the [[urostyle]], components are counted, otherwise the urostyle is usually counted as one vertebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishbase.org/glossary/Glossary.php?q=vertebral+counts|title=System glossary: Vertebral counts|work=Fishbase|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gill raker counts==
The number of gill rakers on the first [[gill arch]] can also be used to identify a fish species. Rakers are counted for the upper and lower limbs of the gill arch, and a raker at the joint of the upper and lower limbs is counted as of the lower. Counts for the upper and lower limbs are separated by a + sign and ranges are bracketed, e.g., GR: 3 + (4-5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=gill+raker+counts&amp;sc=is|title=System glossary: Gill raker counts|work=Fishbase|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DF-ST-86-08080.JPEG|thumb|right|250px|A landing in [[Egypt]].]]
'''Military geography''' is a sub-field of geography that is used by the military, as well as academics and politicians, to understand the geopolitical sphere through the military lens. To accomplish these ends, military geographers consider topics from [[geopolitics]] to physical locations’ influences on military operations and the cultural and economic impacts of a military presence. On a tactical level, a military geographer might put together the terrain and the drainage system below the surface, so a unit is not at a disadvantage if the enemy uses the drainage system to [[ambush]] it, especially in [[urban warfare]]. On a strategic level, an emerging field of strategic and military geography seeks to understand the changing human and biophysical environments that alter the security and military domains.  Climate change, for example, is adding and multiplying the complexity of military strategy, planning and training.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, J., Thomas, M.D. and Durrant, C. "Strategic Military Geography: Climate Change Adaptation and the Military." Handbook of Climate Change Adaptation. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2015. 493-514. http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/522/chp%253A10.1007%252F978-3-642-38670-1_24.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Freferenceworkentry%2F10.1007%2F978-3-642-38670-1_24&amp;token2=exp=1479360129~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F522%2Fchp%25253A10.1007%25252F978-3-642-38670-1_24.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Freferenceworkentry%252F10.1007%252F978-3-642-38670-1_24*~hmac=b6e7c0edff5f362fc667c8f3a6bd40215d3e7400c690401799a7ac3379d74b58&lt;/ref&gt;  Emerging responsibilities for the military to be involved in: protection of civilian populations ([[Responsibility to protect]]), women and ethnic groups; provision of humanitarian aid and disaster response (HADR); new technology and domains of training and operations,such as in cybergeography, make military geography a dynamic frontier.

{{cquote|If a general desired to be a successful actor in the great drama of war, his first duty is to study carefully the theater of operations so that he may see clearly the relative advantages and disadvantages it presents for himself and his enemies.}}
:— [[Antoine-Henri Jomini|Baron De Jomini]]&lt;ref&gt;p.215, Jomini&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and Development of Military Geography==
Military geography has a long and practical history.  For example, ''Imperial Military Geography'' in 1938 &lt;ref&gt;Cole, D. H. (1933). Imperial military geography: general characteristics of the empire in relation to defence. Sifton Praed &amp; CoY London.&lt;/ref&gt; shows how a colonial empire approach to military geography could describe the geographical setting of empire, the responsibilities and the resources that could be mobilised for national or imperial needs.  [[Environmental determinism]], [[regional geography]], [[geographic information system]]s and [[geography]] more generally have all evolved and entwined over hundreds of years.

Canadian, South African and Australian military geography (Pearson et al 2018) is inconspicuous compared to the United States and British traditions. 

There are important links to peace studies and particularly notable was Australian Professor Griffith Taylor who espoused Geopacifics as, ''an attempt to base the teachings of freedom and humanity upon real geographical deductions; it is humanized Geopolitics'' &lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. G. (1946). Our evolving civilization: An introduction to Geopacifics, geographical aspects of the path toward world peace. University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and later observed that, …''so few geographers are prepared to explore public problems which touch on geography as much as on most other disciplines. This is certainly the case with the problem of world peace.'' &lt;ref&gt;Taylor, G. (1963). Geographers and world peace a plea for Geopacifics. ''Geographical Research'', 1, 3–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Urbanistics ==
Russian colonel N. S. Olesik terms the field of analyzing the complex [[urban development|urban environment]] in particular “military geo-urbanistics.” In the open country, units only deal with terrain, weather, and the enemy. In [[urban warfare]], the terrain is more complex, filled with many structures and transformations of the land by the inhabitants, which restrict visibility from the air and create obstacles to ground units. Spaces may be narrow, and convoys may be restricted to certain routes between buildings, where they face roadside bombs and ambushes.

Units must work with or work around the people, some of whom may cooperate and others of whom may oppose, while others are neutral or caught between the two factions.  Guerilla fighters may count on an enemy's unwillingness to bomb or fire on heavily populated areas.

== Types of terrain ==
Several types of terrain and associated climate are prevalent, each affecting combatants differently.

=== Desert warfare ===
{{main article|Desert warfare}}

In an arid climate, as in many [[desert]] areas across the globe, sand is a main concern. [[Sand]] can hamper an army’s attempts to remain hydrated, sapping moisture from skin; sand also jams machinery including the firing mechanisms of firearms.

Terrain is usually fairly flat, though in some regions there are vast, rolling sand dunes.  The desert environment can also contain mountains; as in [[Afghanistan]] and in certain areas around Israel.  Due to the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, the U.S. military has redesigned the uniforms for the different branches of service.  All of the uniforms have a [[digital camouflage]] pattern that is very effective in the desert environment, and the boots have been changed from the standard polished black boots to light brown colored suede leather boots. These boots are cooler under the intense heat of the desert sun.

===Jungle and forest warfare===
{{Main article|Jungle warfare}}

The conditions of these regions are basically the opposite of those found in desert regions.  There are thousands of flora and fauna, and there is always moisture present which presents its own difficulties.  The moisture speeds up the rotting processes as well as causing wounds to become infected much easier because of all of the bacteria that live in the water.  With proper filtration systems an army should have no problem keeping hydrated.

The densely packed trees and underbrush provide concealment from the air as well as from the ground.  Ambushes can be easily conducted in this environment just like they can in an urban environment.   The jungle can also contain mountains, but these mountains are organized differently from those that exist in the desert.  The jungle mountains have far more plant life, and are usually much more difficult to ascend.  Helicopters have been proven as a very useful means of transportation through, actually over, jungle and forested areas; Vietnam was, of course, the testing ground for this.  Tanks and other vehicles have a hard time maneuvering through and around the densely packed trees, and most military aircraft fly too fast to accurately observe the ground through the trees.

===Winter warfare===
{{see also|Arctic warfare}}

This type of warfare is not based on a geographical design, but is based on the drastic differences in this particular climate.  During war it is much harder to remain warm than it is to remain cool.  Even Forested areas can, and many do, experience winter weather conditions.  For this specific type of combat there are soldiers that are specifically trained to fight under the conditions individual to the winter season.  It takes a special skill to fight in the deep snow and extreme cold.  These conditions call for a drastically thicker and thus warmer uniform, and the weapons even need to be refitted with the proper devices to ensure that they will operate in the cold.

===Mountain warfare===
{{main article|Mountain warfare}}

No two mountains are alike, but there is less oxygen at higher altitude. Fighting up a mountain can be very treacherous. There can be avalanches, rockslides, cliffs, and ambushes from higher up the slopes, and there are almost guaranteed to be caves somewhere in the mountain, as in Afghanistan.

===Mud===
Mud is a universal menace to all armies.  While it does not hamper the use of air power, it does slow, and sometimes stops, ground movements all together.  The most common season for mud across the globe is spring.  Following the thawing of winter’s snow and the addition of the rains that the season brings, the ground becomes very soft and almost any military vehicle would get bogged down if not properly equipped.  The mud is not always dependent on the spring. Rather, in some parts of the world, they are determined by the monsoons.

==Ocean fronts (harbors, beaches and sea cliffs)==

===Pirates===
Even today, there is still a problem of [[piracy]] on the world’s oceans.  One of the most commonly thought of areas for this criminal activity is off the coast of [[Somalia]].  There has always been the constant threat of small and fast attack craft coming out to greet a vessel as it passes through the waters between Africa and the Middle East.  Another region that piracy occurs, and it can be of a much larger scale, is in and around the [[Indonesia]]n islands and off the coasts of the Asian mainland.  Here the pirates have been able to capture much larger prizes, and they pose a much larger threat to the security of economic interests of many countries.  Pirates operate from bases that are concealed, but they must be on the waterfront in a country that is either ignorant of their activity, or worse, are paid to overlook it.

To deal with the pirates, if an American vessel is attacked, the [[U.S. Navy]] has multiple assets to deal with the situation.  If the pirates know an attack is imminent, it may be more logical to bomb their base with aircraft from one of the carriers.  However, more often than not, the U.S. Navy would opt for secrecy and send in a smaller force, such as the [[U.S. Navy SEALS]], to eliminate the threat.

===Harbors===
In the concerns of a seaport, especially if it is a goal to either capture or defend it, there are more difficulties than in defending a city that is in land.  With a harbor there is also the threat from the sea in addition to the land and the air.  A harbor is always a key objective for an army to capture when an invasion is commenced.  The sooner the harbor can be captured, the sooner it can be used to bring in massive amounts of reinforcements and material.  The trouble is to capture the harbor before the enemy can sabotage it by blocking the entrance with wreckage or by deploying mines throughout the harbor.  Defending the harbor is a treacherous task because odds are that the enemy can observe your position from both the air and the sea.  The harbor is on the periphery of the defense network of many nations, and even more so if the navy is either deployed or nonexistent.  The best ways to defend the harbor are to have military airfields in close vicinity, to have naval units based in the harbor on a permanent basis, and to be ready to make the harbor unusable by the enemy if they should overcome your defenses.

===Beaches===

===Sea cliffs===
The same rules apply to this category as to the preceding one with the exception of the mines.  Here there is almost no need for anti-vehicle mines, and so, the defenses could be planned without much concern for an armored attack.

== Resources; future flashpoints ==
The Middle East is, of course, the most obvious place that comes to mind when we think of valuable resources that major nations may compete over when supplies begin to fall around the world.  The first Gulf War was an example of the United States’ willingness to go to war to protect its access to the rich oilfields of the Persian Gulf.  The strong military presence there influenced some leaders to aid the United States with cheap oil, but over time those forces began to be viewed as a threat to the Muslim world.  The attacks of September 11, 2001, have brought new hostilities to the region with the invasions of both Afghanistan and Iraq.  Other hotspots around the globe centering on oil are the areas around Venezuela, the Caspian Sea region, and possibly the offshore oil deposits around Vietnam and China.  In today’s age, especially for people living in developed countries,  it is hard to believe that there are other resources that can potentially cause a war.

The most precious and most needed resource of all is water, and in some parts of the world, that is a very expensive resource to obtain.  The most obvious areas that conflict may arise over disputes for water supplies would be in the desert, but at the moment oil is the most valuable liquid in the Middle East.  However, oil will not always be there, and if those people are going to survive, they must have water.  Several times, countries that are upriver have threatened to build dams across the rivers in order to cut off the country down river, starving that particular country of its water supply.  This has been the case with both the Nile and the River Jordan, and the results in both cases have been the same: the countries that are down river have threatened retaliation if such an event should occur.  As our global warming trend continues, our weather patterns will continue to shift, and that means that some places will fall into a severe drought.  These people may become desperate when they do not have the resources to obtain water if such a disaster should occur.

Water is not the only resource on this planet that is found to be a necessity. The forests are as well.  These densely wooded regions of the world are constantly shrinking, and as the oil runs out, people will need to keep warm in the winter.  Odds are that they will return to using wood as a primary fuel source for keeping warm.  As the forests shrink, neighboring countries will turn on each other for this resource in order to appease their populations.  The forests of Latin America and the Pacific Islands are the key hotspots for this resource; this is in part due to the already tense situations in and around those regions because of growing tensions over global oil supplies.

In 2002’s Die Another Day, the term "conflict diamonds" is at the heart of the film’s plot.  In the film, the diamonds are the currency that is used to fund illegal weapons deals, and are used to fund the construction of the Icarus space weapon.  The portrayal of the use of the diamonds that come out of Africa holds true in many cases.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  The term “conflict diamonds” is applied to those diamonds that are not sold through an internationally recognized company.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  They are “conflict diamonds” because warlords in Africa fight for these diamonds in order to sell them to acquire larger wealth and new weapons for continued fighting.  The same is true for the gold fields in southern Africa.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  There are many warlords that would love to have control of the vast wealth of the mines in order to further fund their lucrative endeavors.

== Base construction and closings ==
{{Globalize|date=April 2016}}
The [[United States Department of Defense]] maintains a larger number of domestic and foreign military bases than all other countries combined.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}   Closing redundant military bases in the United States often has a negative economic impact on local communities.  Analysts at [[the Pentagon]] respond to budget limitations by identifying installations that have become obsolete for various reasons.  Sometimes the needs for the location are no longer prevalent in defense strategies or the installation’s facilities have fallen into disrepair.  That is the case with the smaller Reserve and National Guard facilities that dot every state.  The personnel on the committees responsible for determining closures also observe the economic impact that their decisions will have on the communities surrounding the installations.  If 40,000 people are employed because of the installation, either directly or indirectly, it is more likely that that facility will remain open, but only if there is nowhere for the 40,000 people that would lose their jobs.  Those people could end up on welfare, thus becoming just as much of a draw on revenue as they were as employees.

Outside of the United States, some countries are strongly vying for inclusion in strategic treaties such as NATO.  These countries, many of which are in Eastern Europe, want to join [[NATO]] for the mutual advantages of defense and the possibility for foreign bases to be constructed on their soil.  These bases, if they were to be built, would bring fiscal resources that those nations would not get without the bases.  Sometimes foreign bases are viewed as a good thing.  In other regions, a strong political stance may be taken against the construction of foreign military bases, often for sovereignty issues.

==Decline in popularity; evolution of critical military geography==

Due to the subfield of military geography's perceived connection to traditional or classical [[geopolitics]], a field which has since the end of the Cold War been largely rejected as a research focus by proponents of the popular schools of both [[critical geography]] and [[Marxist]] or [[radical geography]], military geography has experienced a decline in popularity in academic circles. This is true particularly in institutions unaffiliated with or unconnected to military or governmental organizations. As a result, although there do exist some popular nonfiction writers of [[geography]] without academic credentials in the field who touch on military strategy or tactics, there are presently few practicing military geographers or students of military geography in academia. Similarly, there have been few major texts on military geography published specifically for a civilian academic audience since the early 2000s. More recently, in a 2014 article published in the journal ''Critical Military Studies'', the authors Rech et al. suggest a revival of the field in line with [[critical geography]] and [[critical geopolitics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/23337486.2014.963416 | volume=1 | title=Geography, military geography, and critical military studies | journal=Critical Military Studies | pages=47–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; One earlier example of this school of thought has been Woodward's 2004 text ''Military Geographies''. However, given the [[postmodern]] bias of critical geographical studies as well as critical geography academics' tendency to proudly claim for themselves a politically [[Political radicalism|radical]] or [[anti-authoritarian]] slant in their research, this form of a revival of military geography seems unlikely to provide sound recommendations for or detailed analyses of major [[geopolitical]] events. This shift in focus would also make military geography less likely to fruitfully inform governmental policy or military strategy, as well as potentially limit the ability of academics to provide their expertise to members of the general public interested in studying or reading about the geographic aspects of military strategy.

==Strategic and Military Geography revival==
The revival of geography and military geography as a sub-discipline is a remarkable trend since 2000 with a number of key geopolitical, international relations,&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, R. D. (2012). ''The revenge of geography: what the map tells us about coming conflicts and the battle against fate.'' Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; historical geography  &lt;ref&gt;Kilcullen, D. (2015). ''Out of the mountains: The coming age of the urban guerrilla.'' Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and geographical approaches being developed.  The American Association of Geographers and Institute of Australian Geographers have interest groups that continue to develop the sub-discipline of military geography. At the American Association of Geographers meeting in 2018 a committee gathered evidence about militarism and military geography.
In 2018 ''Australian Contributions to Strategic and Military Geography'' &lt;ref&gt;Pearson, S. Holloway J.L. &amp; Thackway, R. (2018) ''Australian Contributions to Strategic and Military Geography'' Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; outlined  a new Australian approach and included chapters on themes and specific regions.

Sign Language communication is a system of communication using visual gestures and signs, as used by deaf people. A unique property of [[Sign Language]] is that it is not easy to put on paper due to a lack of formal acceptance, &lt;ref name="written-forms"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language#Written_forms|title=Written Sign Language forms on Wikipedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is impossible to be mediated over the phone or in a plain email. Because of its three-dimensional nature, it can only be transferred in the form of timed two or three dimensional snapshots, also known as a video. The video itself has to be large and fast enough to capture sign language movements sufficiently.

In the late 1990s, it became possible for deaf people to use electronic communication tools as another channel for [[Sign Language]]. Initially, there weren't many choices prior to the advent of more interfaces (e.g. APIs like {{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-streams/#dom-navigator-getusermedias|title=getUserMedia}}). With these, however, deaf people can perform electronic sign language exchanges independently without the need for a third person in the middle, i.e. a [[Video relay service]].

[[Vascular plant]]s with '''monopodial''' growth habits grow upward from a single point. They add leaves to the apex each year and the stem grows longer accordingly. The word ''Monopodial'' is derived from Greek "mono-", ''one'' and "podial", "foot", in reference to the fact that monopodial plants have a single trunk or stem.&lt;ref&gt;http://botanydictionary.org/monopodial-branching.html Dictionary of Botany&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orchidaceae|Orchids]] with monopodial growth often produce copious aerial roots that often hang down in long drapes and have green [[chlorophyll]] underneath the grey [[root]] coverings, which are used as additional photosynthetic organs. They do not have a [[rhizome]] or [[pseudobulb]]s so species adapted to dry periods have fleshy succulent leaves instead. Flowers generally come from the stem between the leaves. With some monopodial species, the stem (the [[rhizome]]) might fork into two, but for all monopodial orchids this is not necessary for continued growth, as opposed to orchids with [[sympodial]] growth.&lt;ref&gt;''The Orchid Expert'', Dr. [[D. G. Hessayon]], Expert Books, Transworld Publishers, London, {{ISBN|978-0-903505-67-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Northwest A&amp;F University''' ('''NWAFU''', A&amp;F referring to Agriculture and Forestry; [[simplified Chinese]]: 西北农林科技大学; [[pinyin]]: Xīběi Nónglín Kējì Dàxué; [[traditional Chinese]]: 西北農林科技大學), is a national key university located in [[Yangling Agricultural Hi-tech Industries Demonstration Zone]], [[Shaanxi Province]], [[P.R.China]]. The university has an old and abandoned name called  Northwest Sci-tech University of Agriculture and Forestry, NWSUAF for short, which is still kept in the [[domain name]] of the university's official website. A&amp;F is included in the [[Double First Class University Plan|Double First Class University Plan]] by [[China's Ministry of Education]] (totally 42 universities were included in this plan) .&lt;ref name="Chinese Department of Education"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A22/moe_843/201709/t20170921_314942.html |title=教育部 财政部 国家发展改革委 关于公布世界一流大学和一流学科建设高校及建设 学科名单的通知 (Notice from the Ministry of Education and other national governmental departments announcing the list of double first class universities and disciplines)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of Northwest A&amp;F University can be dated back to 1934 when '''''National Northwest Senior College of Agriculture and Forestry''''' (simplified Chinese: 国立西北农林专科学校; traditional Chinese: 國立西北農林專科學校) was established by Ministry of Education, [[Republic of China]] based on an act drafted by [[Dai Jitao]], General [[Yang Hucheng]] and [[Yu Youren]] in 1932. This was the first national senior college with speciality on agriculture field in the north-west of China and was also the only independent senior college of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zhshw.nwsuaf.edu.cn/show.php?articleid=752 Interview of NWAFU's Student Admission Office in 2008(Chinese)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Yangling, where the university is located, is believed as the birthplace of [[Houji]], [[Agriculture (Chinese mythology)|God of Abundant Harvests]],&lt;ref&gt;Roberts. ''Chinese Mythology A to Z'', 2nd Ed, p.70. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and is the area where he taught people how to grow and harvest cereals. Since 1934, 7 academic institutions or universities resided here gradually and it is reputable as Town of Agriculture Sciences. Many achievements have been made by university, such as wheat cultivars Biman 1 (by [[:zh:赵洪璋|Zhao, Hongzhang]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://rsc.nwsuaf.edu.cn/show.php?id=2386 Introduction of Zhao Hongzhang and Bima 1(in Chinese)]&lt;/ref&gt; and Xiaoyan 6 (by [[Li Zhensheng (geneticist)|Li, Zhensheng]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kepu.net.cn/gb/special/2009_kpday/tstj/tstj19_02.html Introduction of Xiaoyan 6 (in Chinese)]&lt;/ref&gt; which were dominant wheat cultivars in [[Yellow River]]-[[Huai River]] Wheat Growth Area and significantly increased wheat quality and yield. The Ministry of Education and Shaanxi Province Government proposed to merge the 7 scientific organizations to 1 new University and finally get approved by [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] in 1999, thus establishing Northwest A&amp;F University.

The university expanded rapidly and has Top 3 research and teaching quality in China's agriculture universities&lt;ref&gt;http://edu.qq.com/a/20120416/000438.htm 武书连2012中国大学农学排行榜&lt;/ref&gt; and is a member of "[[Project 985]]" club which is an organization of 39 reputable universities in China. Northwest A&amp;F University's research achievements are dominant in the fields of agriculture biology including [[wheat]] breeding, [[entomology]], agriculture resource management,  [[horticulture]], plant protection, [[food science]] (especially in [[Enology]]), [[forestry]] and [[veterinary]]. Besides, the university is also reputable in agricultural [[water conservancy]], [[agriculture economics]] and management, agriculture mechanics and [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]] and ancient agricultural [[history]] research.The university has an annual income of around [[RMB]] 1.72 billion (around £172 million) in 2011,.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwsuaf.edu.cn/jycgz/30098.htm “回顾五年办学成就，迎接党的十八大召开”系列报道之（九）资源保障与办学支撑条件显著改善&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2013, the university has 1661 teachers and 28964 students.&lt;ref name="2012-2013学年初学校基本数据"&gt;[http://www.nwafu.edu.cn/xxgk/xqtj/index.htm  2012-2013学年初学校基本数据]&lt;/ref&gt;

Northwest A&amp;F University provides courses covering [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], [[engineering]], [[natural science]], [[medicine]], [[management]] and [[economy]] etc. to both native and [[international students]]. These courses are provided by 23 academic [[colleges]]. Students can choose one college to register and pursue their honour degrees at different levels including [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]], [[Master's degree|Master]] and [[PhD]]. [[Studentship]] and [[scholarship]] from [[governments]] and [[organizations]] are available to help students finish their studies.

==Brief history==

=== Origins and re-organization ===
Northwest A&amp;F University was established on September 11, 1999 by merging 5 scientific research institutions and 2 universities in Yangling, Shaanxi Province, namely
# '''[[Institute]] of [[Soil conservation|Soil]] and [[Water Conservation]], [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]''',
# '''Institute of [[Hydrology|Water Resource Sciences]] (Northwest China)''', '''[[Ministry of Water Resources of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Water Resources]] of China'''
# '''[[Shaanxi]] [[Academy]] of Agricultural Sciences'''
# '''Shaanxi Academy of [[Forestry]]'''
# '''Institute of [[Botany]] (Northwest China), [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] and [[Shaanxi Province]]'''
# '''Northwest Agricultural University''' and
# '''Northwest Forestry College'''.
The 7 members involved in re-organization were very close to each other historically. '''Northwest Agricultural University''' has the biggest area and the longest history out of 7 members and are the origin of '''Institute of Water Resource Sciences (Northwest China)''' and '''Northwest Forestry College'''. Her history can be dated back to 1934(Year 23 in [[Minguo calendar]]) when '''''National Northwest Senior College of Agriculture and Forestry''''' (the predecessor of Northwest Agricultural University) was founded by the Senior Politician of [[Kuomintang]] Mr. [[Yu Youren]], Kuomintang veteran member [[Dai Jitao]], Kuomintang General [[Yang Hucheng]] .In 1937 and 1938, the Senior College merged with College of Agriculture of National Northwest Associated University and Department of Animal Husbandry in College of Agriculture of National [[Henan University]] (河南大学) respectively, then was renamed as National Northwest Agricultural College. Meanwhile, Department of Water Conservancy of National [[Lanzhou University]] （兰州大学） joined the College. Following the establishment of P.R.China in 1949, "National" was deleted from the College name although it remains a government funded academic school. In 1952, Department of Agricultural Water Conservancy was partially given to [[Xi'an Jiaotong University]] （西安交通大学） under the order of The State Council. 2 years later, the remained Department of Agricultural Water Conservancy became an independent academic institution which is the mold of '''Institute of Water Resource Sciences (Northwest China)'''. In 1979, '''Northwest Forestry College''' came out to be an independent school from Department of Forestry in Northwest Agricultural College. In 1985, with the approval of the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fishery, the University name changed to be '''Northwest Agricultural University'''.&lt;br /&gt;
Other institutions have relatively shorter history. Institute of Botany (Northwest China) became an independent academy from '''Institute of Soil and Water Conservation, Chinese Academy of Sciences''' (founded in 1956) in 1965. In 1980, '''[[Shaanxi]] Academy of Forestry''' got separated from '''Shaanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences''' (founded in 1952).

The State Council agreed to merge 7 organizations as new Northwest A&amp;F University&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.cn/xxgk/pub/govpublic/mrlm/201011/t20101114_62708.html Official decision on establishing new A&amp;F, from State Council]&lt;/ref&gt;  in a reply to the proposal drafted by Ministry of Education and Shaanxi Province Government. A financial budget of 600,000,000 RMB was granted as start fund and further investment plan as well as related issue such as reshuffle were also briefly stated in this official reply. On 11 September 1999, a central government delegation led by Vice Premier [[Li Lanqing]] attended the opening ceremony and made the announcement.

== Campus and students life ==
[[Image:WP 20150421 006.jpg|thumb|left|Office Building, '''South Campus''']]
[[Image:WP 20150422 095.jpg|thumb|NO.3 Teaching Building, '''North Campus'''. The name of '''National Northwest Senior College of Agriculture and Forestry''', written by [[Dai Jitao]], is still readable after around 80 years.]]
The University urban area is around 3.94&amp;nbsp;km², covering two main campuses: '''North Campus''' and '''South Campus'''. Besides, Institute of Water and Soil Conservation, College of Food Science and Engineering and College of Water Resources and Architectural Engineering have their own independent campuses for administrative affairs and research respectively. A 3D virtual campus map of A&amp;F has been generated and visitors can have a virtual tour around A&amp;F campuses on '''http://3dmap.nwsuaf.edu.cn'''.

[[Image:WP 20150423 048.jpg|thumb|left|Inside view of Science and Research Building, South Campus]]
Generally, '''South Campus''' hosts study and living facilities for senior undergraduates from College of Agriculture, College of Horticulture, College of Forestry, College of Water Resources and Architectural Engineering, College of Resource and Environment and College of Economics and Management. All students from International School, most of postgraduates, undergraduates from Department of Arts (Landscape Arts Design) and all students from College of Vocational and Adult Education also live and study in South Campus.

[[Image:WP 20150422 127.jpg|thumb|right|Agriculture Science Building, South Campus. This magnificent building will be used as labs by 4 agriculture science-related academic colleges.]]
Although '''North Campus''' is mainly for undergraduates of other colleges, some postgraduates move to North Campus for their research since they become the 2nd year students. On South Campus, Agriculture Science Building, Social Science Building, new apartments as well as students facilities are under construction now. Study and living environment will be greatly improved when these buildings are available. Besides, A&amp;F provides vehicles (small bus) to ferry students and staff between South Campus and North Campus on a daily schedule.

[[Image:WP 20150421 004.jpg|thumb|left|The Gate of Museums Garden, South Campus]]
The [[Museum]] Garden (a collection of 5 museums including [[insects]], [[animals]], [[plants]], [[soil]] and China's agricultural history) is located beside South Campus. The Insects Museum holds the most extensive collection of [[butterflies]] in China's Universities. This garden is also the greatest Agriculture-themed museum area in China. Besides its teaching role for A&amp;F students, this garden is also serving as a popular science centre in Shaanxi Province and attracts thousands of visitors especially young students every year.
[[Image:WP 20150422 002.jpg|thumb|Entomology Museum, South Campus]]

A&amp;F provides convenient [[sports facilities]] to staff and students. Across the campuses, there are 12 [[tennis courts]], 1 indoor [[stadium]], 2 outdoor stadiums, 1 [[arena]] for [[volleyball]] and [[basketball]], 2 outdoor [[swimming pools]], 48 outdoor [[basketball courts]], 28 outdoor [[volleyball court]]s, several [[Badminton|badminton courts]] and 143 outdoor tables for [[Table tennis|Ping-Pong]]. Tennis is popular across the campus and tennis championships are held every year. A&amp;F also supports College Students Basketball and Volleyball Team to gain reputation in CUBA ([[Chinese University Basketball Association]]) and CUVA (Chinese University Volleyball Association). 
[[Image:WP 20150422 004.jpg|thumb|left|Indoor Stadium, South Campus]]
[[Image:WP 20150422 068.jpg|thumb|right|Swimming Pool, South Campus]]
The university library was initially launched in 1934 and got extended in 1999 when new A&amp;F was established. In both North and South Campus, the well equipped air-conditioning system in the library makes it a popular site for students' study, especially in summer. A training centre for engineering in North Campus provides engineering courses and practices to all undergraduates, especially students majored at mechanics and electronics. At the heart of North Campus stands the tallest building of A&amp;F, the ten-storey NO. 8 Teaching Building. Along with its 12 subsidiary great lecture halls, they serve as the teaching centre in North Campus. 
[[Image:WP 20150423 013.jpg|thumb|left|Library, South Campus]]

[[Chefs]] in 11 [[cafeterias]] scattered in the 2 main campuses cook breakfast, lunch and supper to students and staff every day in each term. However, the cafeterias are usually very busy and crowded at dining time. Among these cafeterias, 2 [[Muslim]] cafeterias&lt;ref&gt;[http://gs.nwsuaf.edu.cn/houqinxinwen/uploadfile/201105/20110509031623183.jpg One Muslim cafeterias in North Campus]&lt;/ref&gt; are specially built to cater for the needs of Muslim group. Food safety in these cafeterias is seriously controlled to provide good quality food. Campus Card (a campus identity card which acts like a Debit card to facilitate payment across campuses) is needed to buy food in all cafeterias but cash is also accepted.

Totally 48 [[dorm]] buildings are available for students. For Chinese students, 4 or 6 students share 1 bedroom&lt;ref&gt;[http://gs.nwsuaf.edu.cn/houqinxinwen/uploadfile/201008/20100831063710934.jpg Typical Chinese Students Dorms]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[international students]] live in single or double bedroom equipped with [[bathroom]] and [[toilet]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csc.edu.cn/laihua/universityAccommodation.aspx?collegeId=69 International Students Dorms in NWAFU]&lt;/ref&gt;(the price is much higher). Air conditioning in all students dormitories will be available since summer of 2015. As a part of International A&amp;F project, new apartments for international students and foreign experts will be ready since 2015. All apartments and dormitories are centrally heated in winter from 15 November to 15 March next year.

Campus events are usually hold in Xiu-Shan Students Venue Centre in North and South Campus. Xiu-Shan was named after Xiu-Shan Zhu, the father of a Taiwanese entrepreneur Yinglong Zhu who endowed NWAFU. Now, Xiu-Shan Students Venue is an important place for campus events such as [[exhibition]], [[concert]], [[Festival|gala]] and conferences.

'''Occupational science''' is an interdisciplinary field in the social and behavioral sciences dedicated to the study of humans as "occupational beings". As used here, the term "occupation" refers to the goal-directed activities that characterize daily human life as well as the characteristics and patterns of purposeful activity that occur over lifetimes as these affect health and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Zemke, R. &amp; Clark, F.(1996). ''Occupational Science: The evolving discipline''. Philadelphia, F.A. Davis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, C.H. &amp; Townsend, E.A. (Eds) ''An introduction to occupation: The art and science of living''.(2nd Ed).Upper Saddle River, NJ, Pearson&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Occupational science evolved as a loosely organized effort by many scholars in different disciplines to understand human time use. It was named and given additional impetus in 1989 by a team of faculty at the [[University of Southern California]] led by Elizabeth Yerxa,&lt;ref&gt;Yerxa, E., Clark, F., Jackson, J., Parham, D., Pierce, D., Stein, C., et al. (1989). An introduction to occupational science, A foundation for occupational therapy in the 21st century. ''[[Occupational Therapy in Health Care]]'', 6(4), 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt; who had been influenced by the work of graduate students under the supervision of Mary Reilly.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, M. (1962)Occupational therapy can be one of the great ideas of 20th Century medicine. ''American Journal of Occupational Therapy'', 16, 1-9)&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational science emerged as a way to expand and support the profession of occupational therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Hocking, C. &amp; Wright-St Clair, V. (2011). Occupational science: Adding value to occupational therapy. New Zealand 
Journal of Occupational Therapy, 58(1), 29-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Link between occupational science and occupational therapy==

Occupational science was developed by [[Occupational therapist|occupational therapists]] using the principles of [[occupational therapy]] and is still a developing discipline.&lt;ref name=Glover&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glover|first1=J|title=The literature of occupational science: A systematic, quantitative examination of peer-reviewed publications from 1996-2006|journal=Journal of Occupational Science|date=2009|volume=16|issue=2|pages=92–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wilcock&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilcock|first1=A|title=Occupational science: Bridging occupation and health|journal=Canadian Journal of Occupational Therapy|volume=72|issue=1|pages=5–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The substrates of occupation (form, function, and meaning) are difficult to observe,&lt;ref name=Schell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schell|first1=B|last2=Gillen|first2=G|last3=Scaffa|first3=M|title=Willard &amp; Spackman's Occupational Therapy|date=2013|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=82–92|edition=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and require a multidisciplinary approach. While both occupational therapy and occupational science are rooted in a [[Holistic health|holistic approach]], the interdisciplinary methods for observing form, function, and meaning of occupations are not always holistic. For instance, disciplines such as biomechanics and psychology inform occupational science but, themselves, are not necessarily holistic in nature. Clinical practice can prompt new ideas and spark potential research within the discipline of occupational science.&lt;ref name=Pierce&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pierce|first1=D|title=Occupational Science for Occupational Therapy|date=2014|publisher=Slack Inc.|location=Thorofare, NJ|isbn=9781556429330}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Occupational science has the capacity to provide insight into the primary modality of occupational therapy (occupation) through researching the restorative dimension of participation in occupation and its therapeutic value.&lt;ref name=howell&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Howell|first1=D|last2=Pierce|first2=D|title=Exploring the forgotten restorative dimension of occupation: Quilting and quilt use|journal=Journal of Occupational Science|date=2000|volume=7|issue=2|pages=68–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Participation in few occupations or choosing to participate in harmful occupations, such as substance use, can lead to “illness, isolation and despair,” or even death.&lt;ref name=wilcock /&gt;  However, participation in restorative occupations can enhance health.&lt;ref name=howell /&gt;  Through participation in restorative occupations, the mental state of individuals can be improved and result in feelings of regeneration.&lt;ref name=howell /&gt;  Sleep, an [[Occupational therapy#Areas of occupation|area of occupation]], not only regenerates physical and cognitive processes, but also is required for occupational functioning.&lt;ref name=howell /&gt;  Participating in other restful occupations, such as reading a book, going for a walk, and exercising, can provide physical, cognitive, and mental restoration.&lt;ref name=howell /&gt;

==Academic application==
Occupational science now includes university-based academic programs leading to undergraduate and graduate degrees in the field. Disciplines within which occupational scientists can be found include [[architecture]], [[engineering]], [[education]], [[marketing]],  [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[occupational therapy]], [[leisure science]], [[public health]], and [[geography]]. There are several national, regional and international societies dedicated to promoting the evolution of this specialized area of human science. Academic journals containing content directly relevant to occupational science include the ''Journal of Occupational Science,'' ''[http://journals.sagepub.com/home/otj OTJR: Occupation, Participation and Health],'' ''The Journal of Leisure Research'', [https://www.springer.com/10902 ''Journal of Happiness Studies''], [https://www.springer.com/11136 ''Quality of Life Research''], [https://www.springer.com/11482 ''Applied Research in Quality of Life''], and various occupational therapy journals.

'''''Oedipus Judaicus''''' by [[William Drummond of Logiealmond|William Drummond]] was first published in 1811 in a limited edition of 200 copies. The book was originally intended for use in a scholastic setting in an attempt to protect Drummond's political career from ridicule.

The work is a commentary on a supposed [[astrological allegory]] in the [[Old Testament]] of the Bible, patterned after the ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'' of [[Athanasius Kircher|Kircher]]. In the book, Drummond seeks possible sources of the Biblical writings, from the [[Dendera temple complex|Temple of Denderah]] to parallels with the [[Roman mythology|Roman god]]s, dealing primarily with the [[s:Bible (King James)/Genesis#Chapter 49|49th chapter]] of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and the [[book of Joshua]] to draw his conclusions.

The book was reprinted in 1866 and again in 1986, and is again in print.

[[File:Rossi lhf safdao Z1.jpg|thumb|A common output interface of the omniview system]]
'''Omniview technology''' (also known as "surround view" or "bird view technology") is a [[Intelligent Parking Assist System|vehicle parking assistant]] technology that first became available in vehicle electronic products in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.engadget.com/2007/09/17/infinitis-ex35-around-view-monitor-system-makes-windows-redunda/&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed to help drivers in parking a vehicle in small space.

== Principle==
Early vehicle parking assistant products use proximity sensors or a single [[Backup camera|rear-view camera]] to get information about obstacles around, and provide drivers with sound alarm or rear-view video. There are some drawbacks about such products: the alarm is not intuitive, and the rear-view camera has blind area. However, omniview technology overcomes these problems and has seen increasing applications.

In a common omniview system, there are four wide-field cameras: one in the front of the vehicle, one in the back of the vehicle, one in the left rear view mirror, and one in the right outside mirror. The four cameras cover the whole area around vehicle. The system synthesizes a [[bird view]] image in front of the vehicle by distortion correction, projection transformation, and [[image fusion]]. The images shown below are input and output of a common omniview product.

The '''POISK Centre''' (in [[Russian language|Russian]]:''Центр «ПОИСК»'') is an educational and research organization founded in 2004 at [[Saint Petersburg State University]] ([[Russia]]). Its primary aim is to encourage secondary school students and university students to do independent [[scientific research]].

The POISK Centre supports educational programs that motivate youth to develop an interest in [[physics]] and [[natural sciences]], and to involve them in “what a real scientist does” as early as possible. These activities include tight collaboration with leading universities and secondary schools in Russia and abroad, joint seminars and workshops, regular international scientific conferences, language programs, but also the promotion of research competitions, such as the [[International Young Physicists' Tournament|Young Physicists' Tournament]].

POISK means ‘search’ in [[Russian language|Russian]], but it is also a Russian abbreviation for the Support Centre for Olympiads and Intellectual Competitions.

== Achievements ==

Since 2004, the POISK Centre is the only university-based organization in Russia that is being selecting, supervising and preparing the National team that represents Russia at the [[International Young Physicists' Tournament]].

The POISK Centre’s team has been a participant of [[International Young Physicists' Tournament|IYPTs]] in 2004 ([[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]), 2005 ([[Winterthur]], [[Switzerland]]) and 2006 ([[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]]) with significant success, winning bronze medals twice. In May 2007, the POISK’s Russian team fought in the Finals and won silver at the [[Austrian Young Physicists' Tournament]] held in [[Leoben]], [[Austria]].

In November 2007, the POISK's team of university students was one of the two gold winners at the [[Ukrainian Physicists' Tournament for University Students]] held at the [[Kiev National University]], [[Ukraine]].

'''''Prayers for Bobby''''' is a televised [[docudrama]] that premiered on the [[Lifetime Television|Lifetime]] network on January 24, 2009. It is based on the critically acclaimed book, ''[[Prayers for Bobby: A Mother's Coming to Terms with the Suicide of Her Gay Son]]'', by [[Leroy F. Aarons]], which is itself based on the true story of the life and legacy of Bobby Griffith, a young [[homosexuality|gay]] man who killed himself in 1983 due to his mother's [[homophobia]]. [[Ryan Kelley]] stars as Bobby Griffith and [[Sigourney Weaver]] portrays Mary, his mother.

The film was nominated for two [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] ("Best Movie" &amp; "Best Actress"), and Sigourney Weaver was nominated for the 2010 Golden Globe Award, and the 2010 Screen Actors Guild Award. It also won the 2010 [[GLAAD Media Award]], and producers were nominated for the 2010 [[Producers Guild of America Award]]. The film won the 2010 Entertainment Industry Coalition PRISM Award ("Best Movie for Television"). In 2015, executive producers Daniel Sladek &amp; Chris Taaffe were invited by the Vice President of the EU to the European Parliament in Brussels where they presented ''Prayers for Bobby'' to Members of Parliament on International Homophobia Day.

==Plot==
Mary Griffith is a devout Christian who raises her children—Ed, Bobby, Joy and Nancy—according to the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] teachings of her local [[Presbyterian]] church in the late 1970s and early 1980s in [[Walnut Creek, California]]. 

Ed finds Bobby resisting temptations to overdose on [[Aspirin]] as an initial suicide attempt before Bobby confides to him that he is [[Homosexuality|gay]]. Life changes for the entire family after Mary learns about his secret. In hopes of converting him, she takes him to a [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]], who explains to Bobby's parents that a person's homosexuality is the result of lacking a close relationship with parental figures. She then advises Bobby to pray harder and seek solace in Church activities, as well as to arrange a special bonding time with his father. While spending such quality time with his father, Bobby explains his desire to become a writer, to which his father suggests "some dreams are just not realistic." 

Bobby's father and siblings slowly come to terms with his homosexuality, but Mary believes God can cure him. To get away from his family, Bobby visits his cousin Jeanette in [[Portland, Oregon]]; she has always been accepting of his sexual orientation and tries to help him realize that his mother will never change. Desperate for his mother's approval, he does what is asked of him, but through it all, the Church's disapproval of homosexuality and his mother's attempts to suppress his growing behaviors in public cause him to grow increasingly withdrawn and depressed.

Stricken with guilt, Bobby finds a boyfriend, David, at a [[gay bar]]. Nonetheless, before leaving the house with David, Mary informs Bobby that she "will not have a gay son." After Bobby finds David betraying him for another boy, he continues to think of his mother's words of [[prejudice]], i.e., when saying "homosexuality is a sin and (gays) are doomed to spend eternity in hell," as well as calling him "sick," "perverted," and "a danger to our children." Following his subsequent depression and self-loathing which intensifies, one night he free falls off a bridge on a highway into the path of an oncoming eighteen-wheeler truck, which kills him instantly. The family receives the news the following day and are devastated.

Faced with their tragedy, Mary begins to question herself and her Church's interpretation of the [[Scripture]]. Through her long and emotional journey, Mary slowly reaches out to the [[gay community]] and discovers unexpected support from them. She becomes acquainted with a local reverend of the [[Metropolitan Community Church]], who convinces her to attend a meeting of [[Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays]] (PFLAG). It is there she recalls Bobby being different from [[Conception (biology)|conception]] and reassures herself that his true value was in his heart.

Mary then gives a speech in a Walnut Creek city council meeting supporting a local "gay day" live on television. She tells of her experiences with Bobby, the struggles she initially had coping with him [[coming out of the closet]] and her stubbornness to reevaluate her religious beliefs which were nothing more than "bigotry" and "dehumanizing slander." Mary also acknowledges how she came to realize that Bobby's sexual orientation was quite natural in God's image and his suicide was subsequently due to poor parenting. She concludes her speech by urging people to think before they say, voice, or support [[homophobia]] because "a child is listening." The measure is rejected, but Mary and her family travel to San Francisco with fellow PFLAG members and walk in a [[gay pride parade]], during which she sees another young man just like Bobby observing the parade. She walks over and hugs him, finally coming to terms with her son's death and vowing to work hard for the rights of gays and lesbians.&lt;ref name="Lifetime Television"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mylifetime.com/on-tv/movies/prayers-bobby |title=Prayers For Bobby |work=[[MyLifetime.com]] |accessdate=2009-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231042811/http://www.mylifetime.com/on-tv/movies/prayers-bobby |archivedate=December 31, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Quality of Government (QoG)-institute''' is an independent research institute at the [[University of Gothenburg]]. 

The institute was founded by Professors [[Bo Rothstein]] and [[Sören Holmberg]] in 2004 and is partly financed by the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation ([[Riksbankens Jubileumsfond]]), the Swedish Science Council ([[Vetenskapsrådet]]), and the [[Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation]]. 

The main objective the QoG institute´s research is to address the theoretical and empirical problem of how political institutions of high quality can be created and maintained. Another objective is to study the effects of Quality of Government on a number of policy areas, such as health, the environment, social policy, and poverty. 

Since its start in 2004, the QoG institute has continuously gathered various data related to its research field. Since 2008, the institute has also conducted their own web surveys among experts in the public administration. Today, the survey comprises data from 1053 experts over 135 countries. All data is compiled in different databases and are free to download on the institute’s website. On the institute’s website, there is also a data visualization tool available that makes it possible to create interactive maps and scatter plots.

The QoG institute participates in a number of international research projects. During the years 2012-2017, the institute is coordinating a large scale research project - [http://anticorrp.eu ANTICORRP] - financed  by the [[European Commission]]s [[Seventh Framework Programme]].

Most of the scientific articles, reports, and working papers that are produced by the institutes’ researchers are free to download on the institute’s [http://www.qog.pol.gu.se/publications website].

'''''Read More About It''''' was a [[public service announcement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-ark.org.uk/mivana/mediaplayer.php?id=b3ed709abaa8c83f5d2317e93b2f6011&amp;media=cbs-1982-readmoreaboutit&amp;type=mp4 |title=iNTERACTIVE (Beta5-U312010) |publisher=TV ARK |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; campaign created as a joint venture between [[CBS]] and the [[Library of Congress]] that ran from 1980 to 1999 on CBS. The campaign, which usually aired one at the end of a special primetime program, was famous for its opening title sequence, which originally showed a live action TV set which zoomed in using [[stop motion]] that used pages on the side flipping into either the celebrity of the program aired or just on-screen graphics, which was remade in 1990 using [[computer animation]] that used [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] for the pages on the side of the TV flipping to revolve to the celebrity/graphics. The spiel in each PSA talks about learning more about what happened in the program, the books the Library of Congress suggests, and that they can be found in their local library or [[bookstore]]. It ended with either the celebrity of the program or an announcer saying, "Visit them. They'll be happy to help you ''Read More About It''." 

Originally the theme music was composed by [[Keith Mansfield]], but in 1983, "Moments of Courage" by composer [[Craig Palmer]] became the theme for the PSAs.  Along with a remade intro came a new theme for the campaign which lasted for the 1990s.  With the arrival of the internet came new resources to learn about the subject of the special or movie aired on CBS and other networks.  Because of this, ''Read More About It'' was succeeded at the turn of the 21st century by the ''[[CBS Cares]]'' campaign, which like its predecessor usually airs at the end of either a movie (example: ''[[The Karen Carpenter Story]]'') (until 2010) or a special program (example: The [[Grammy Awards]] or the [[Super Bowl]]) and focuses primarily on resources, online and print, to learn about the event or subject featured in the preceding program or community involvement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4247">'''Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II)'''&lt;br /&gt;
The Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II) is a regional economic model developed and maintained by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).

Regional input-output multipliers such as the RIMS II multipliers allow estimates of how a one-time or sustained increase in economic activity in a particular region will impact other industries located in the region - i.e., estimating local shocks on gross output, value added, earnings, and employment. RIMS II multipliers differ from macro-economic multipliers, which are used to assess the effects of fiscal stimulus on gross national product. Differences in industry-specific regional multipliers are not meaningful, nor appropriate for use in a national context.

RIMS II allows for estimates at the regional level because the multipliers are based on BEA data at the national and regional level.

RIMS II multipliers have been used by both the public and private sectors. There are numerous examples of their use:

* Federal Government agencies have used the multipliers to study the local impact of government regulation on specific industries and to assess the local economic impacts of Federal actions such as military base closings.
* State and local governments have used the multipliers to estimate the regional economic impacts of government policies and projects and of events, such as firms locating within their state, or to assess the impacts of tourism.
* Businesses and private consultants have used the multipliers to estimate the economic impacts of a wide range of projects, such as building a new sports facility or expanding an airport; of natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina; or of special events, such as national political conventions.

RIMS II provides six types of multipliers: final-demand multipliers for output, earnings, employment, and value added; and direct-effect multipliers for earnings and employment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bea.gov/regional/rims/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History'''

The BEA introduced the RIMS tool in the early 1970s; an enhancement of the framework was completed in the 1980s, introducing RIMS II, which is the current framework.&lt;ref&gt;Daley, William M., US Department of Commerce. March 1997. "Regional Mutlipliers: A User Handbook for the Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II)". Available at https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/regional/perinc/meth/rims2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The RIMS II framework is updated every few years with new data, depending on the resources available to the BEA. For example, after 2012, the BEA stopped releasing new updates to the multipliers. In 2015, the BEA began re-releasing the multipliers; they are generally released on an annual basis.

'''Data'''

The RIMS II framework currently encompasses multipliers for the "benchmark series". In past, the BEA also released an "annual series;" however, the annual series has been discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/regional/rims/rimsii/|title=BEA RIMS II Online System|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iiusa.org/blog/rims-ii-regional-multipliers-updated-time-2012/|title=RIMS II Regional Multipliers Updated for First Time Since 2012|last=Kester|first=Michael|date=February 23, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RIMS II benchmark multiplier system is based national benchmark input-output data combined with regional data. Often, the national dataset is a few years behind the regional dataset.

'''Releases'''

This list currently does not go through all releases of the BEA RIMS II multipliers, but does list the last few and the associated datasets:
* 2016, December (most recent): 2007 national benchmark input-output data and 2015 regional data
* 2015, November: 2007 national benchmark input-output data and 2013 regional data
* 2012, October: 2002 national benchmark input-output data and 2010 regional data

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2012">The '''SLAM project''', which was started by [[Microsoft Research]], aimed at verifying some software safety properties using [[model checking]] techniques. It is implemented in OCaml, and has been used to find many bugs in Windows Device Drivers.

SLAM uses a technique called counterexample-guided abstraction refinement, which uses progressively better models of the program under test.

'''Shamanic music''' is music played either by actual shamans as part of their rituals, or by people who, whilst not themselves shamans, wish to evoke the cultural background of [[shamanism]] in some way. So '''Shamanic music''' includes both music used as part of shamans' rituals and music that refers to, or draws on, this.

In shamanism the shaman has a more active musical role than the medium in [[spirit possession]]. But a shaman's ritual is a ritual performance and not a musical performance, and this shapes its musical dimension. A shaman uses various ways of making sounds to which different ritual purposes are ascribed. Of particular importance are the shaman's song and shaman's drumming.

Recently in [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia|Siberia]], music groups drawing on a knowledge of shamanic culture have emerged. In the West shamanism has served as an imagined background to musics meant to [[altered state of consciousness|alter a listener's state of mind]].

[[Culture of Korea|Korea]] and [[Tibetan culture|Tibet]] are two cultures where the music of shamanic ritual has interacted closely with other traditions.

[[File:Gitksan man.jpg|thumb|right|Gitksan shaman with rattle]]

== Shamanic and musical performance ==

Although shamans use singing as well as drumming and sometimes other instruments, a shamanic ritual is not a musical performance in the normal sense, and the music is directed more to [[spirits]] than to an audience. Several things follow from this. First, a shamanic ritual performance is, above all, a series of actions and not a series of musical sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Mihály Hoppál, ''Tracing Shamanism in Tuva: A History of Studies'', in Mongush Kenin Lopsan,  ''Shamanic Songs and Myths of Tuva'', Istor Budapest 1997 p 129 "...the struggle with the harmful spirits during which great drumbeats indicated that the shaman had driven a "steel arrow" for each beat into the spirits of sickness."&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the shaman's attention is directed inwards towards her or his visualisation of the spirit world and communication with the spirits, and not outwards to any listeners who might be present.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hodgkinson, ''Musicians, Carvers, Shamans'', Cambridge Anthropology vol 25, no 3, (2005/2006) p 9."Sergei Tumat (a Tuvan shaman who had previously studied music):   “When I shamanize, I'm not here, not in the place where I'm playing the dungur drum, it's just  my material body that's there: I'm away with the spirits, that's where my total attention is. If someone touches me, tries to get my attention there in the yurt, that's dangerous, it  would be like falling a long way: so it's completely different from playing music to an  audience, where you have to be there, to be attentive to what your material body is  doing, to everything I learned in music school...”"&lt;/ref&gt; Third, it is important for the success of the ritual that it be given its own clearly defined context that is quite different from any kind of entertainment. Fourth, any theatrical elements that are added to impress an audience are of a type to make the contact with the spirits seem more real and not to suggest the performer's musical virtuosity. From a musical perspective shamanic ritual performances have the distinctive feature of {{wt|en|discontinuity}}. Breaks may happen because a spirit is proving difficult to communicate with, or the shaman needs to call a different spirit. Typically, phases of the performance are broken off abruptly, perhaps to be restarted after a gap, perhaps not.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Pegg, ''Mongolian Music, Dance and Oral Narrative'', University of Washington Press, 2001, p135-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Hutton, ''The Shamans of Siberia'', Isle of Avalon Press, 1993, p29 and p31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Humphrey, ''Shamans and elders''. Oxford, OUP1996,  p 235-7&lt;/ref&gt; The rhythmic dimension of the music of shamans' rituals has been connected to the idea of both incorporating the rhythms of nature and magically re-articulating them.&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Serra, (in Italian)''Ritmo e ciclità nella cultura sciamanica'', in Antonello Colimberti (ed) ''Musiche e sciamani'', Textus, Milan 2000, p67&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shamanism and possession ==

It has been argued&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Rouget, ''Music and Trance'', University of Chicago Press 1985 p125&lt;/ref&gt; that shamanism and [[spirit possession]] involve contrasting kinds of special states of mind. The shaman actively enters the spirit world, negotiates with her or his own helper spirit and then with other spirits as necessary, and moves between different territories of the spirit world. The possessed medium, on the other hand,  is the passive recipient of a powerful spirit or god. This reflects on the different uses of music involved. Possession music&lt;ref&gt;Fremont E.Besmer, ''Horses, Musicians and Gods: The Hausa Cult of Possession-Trance''.  Ahmadu Bello UP 1983&lt;/ref&gt; is typically long in duration, [[Hypnosis|mesmeric]], loud and intense, with climaxes of rhythmic intensity and volume to which the medium has learned to respond by entering a trance state: the music is not played by the medium but by one or more musicians. In shamanism, the music is played by the shaman, confirms the shaman's power (in the words of the shaman's song), and is used actively by the shaman to modulate movements and changes of state as part of an active journey within the spirit world. In both cases the connection between music and an [[altered state of mind]] depends on both psychoacoustic and cultural factors, and the music cannot be said to 'cause' trance-states.&lt;ref&gt;Roberte Hamayon,(in French) ''Pour en finir avec la 'trance' et 'l'extase' dans l'étude du chamanisme'', in Etudes mongoles et sibériennes 26: Variations Chamaniques 2, 1995, p155 seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of sounds ==
{{See also|Sound mimesis in various cultures|Imitation of sounds in shamanism}}

Sound is tactile; whereas visual information is experienced at the surface, auditory information seems to be both outside and inside the body.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Ong, ''Orality and Literacy: The technologizing of the word'', Methuen, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sound mimesis in various cultures|In oral cultures in which survival involves close contact with nature, sound often connects inner feelings to features of the natural environment]]. In many cases, this holds also for the [[Imitation of sounds in shamanism|music in shamanistic practice, including e.g. onomatopoeia, imitation of animal cries etc.]]. The shaman's use of sound is to catalyse an imaginary inner environment which is experienced as a sacred space-time in which the shaman travels and encounters spirits.  Sound, passing constantly between inner and outer, connects this imaginary space with the actual space of the ritual in which the shaman is moving and making ritual actions and gestures.

It has been suggested that the sound material used by the shaman constitutes a system of sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Ruggero, (in Italian)  ''La musica sciamanica'' . - Xenia - 2004, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of a [[semiotics]] of the sound material would imply a symbolic language shared between the shaman and the surrounding community. However, the evidence suggests that any symbolic language elements are understood only by the shaman and perhaps by other shamans initiated by this shaman. In other words, the symbolic language - if there is one - is more likely to be shared with the spirits than with a human community.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Taussig,  ''The Nervous System'' . - Routledge - 1992 p.177&lt;/ref&gt;

A shaman may use different sounds for different ritual purposes: 
*'''Setting up the sound-space of the ritual''' 
A very important element in [[Shamanism in Siberia|Siberian shamanism]] is the use of hanging metallic objects - possibly including small bells - attached to the shaman's ritual cloak and to the inside of the drum and also sometimes to the beater. This sets up a continuously moving sound field, heard as a single complex sound.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Stiller, ''Handbook of Instrumentation'', University of California Press, 1985, p 121, {{ISBN|0-520-04423-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further element is the spatialisation of sound brought about not only by the shaman's movement, but also by techniques of singing into the drum to create the illusion of the voice coming from elsewhere. Different individual shamans and different local traditions may use different sounds. For example, in the south of Tuva and in Mongolia the ''khomus'', or jaw harp is commonly used in shamanising.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Pegg, ''Mongolian Music, Dance and Oral Narrative'', University of Washington Press, 2001, p124&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Preparation'''
Particular sounds, like bells, may be used for purifying the place in which the ritual is to be performed.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Walker, ''Music as Knowledge in Shamanism and Other Healing Traditions of Siberia'', in
Arctic Anthropology.2003; 40(2): p45&lt;/ref&gt; This is because a ritual involving contact with the spirits is always potentially dangerous, and one of the dangers is that of pollution.

*'''Calling and sending back spirits'''
A bell may also be used for calling or sending back spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Kongin Seo, ''Hanyang Kut: Korean Shaman Ritual Music from Seoul'', Routledge 2002 p14&lt;/ref&gt; Shamans will also imitate the sounds of birds and animals in order to call spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Levin, ''Where Rivers and Mountains Sing'',  (Indiana University Press 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Sami shamanic singing, called [[Joik]], is also about summoning, for example, animal spirits, rather than singing about them or representing them: the spirit is experienced as being present.&lt;ref&gt;Tina Ramnarine, ''Acoustemology, Indigeneity &amp; Joik'', Ethnomusicology vol 53, no 2, spring/summer 2009, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Healing'''
Within shamanic ritual, sound can also be used as a healing power, conceived as a way of directing spiritual energy from the shaman into an afflicted person.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Walker, 2003, p46&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tuva]] sick persons are said to have been healed by the sound of a stringed instrument made from a tree struck by lightning.

== Shaman's song ==

The '''shaman's song''' - or ''algysh'' &lt;ref&gt;Mongush Kenin Lopsan, ''Shamanic Songs and Myths of Tuva'' Istor Budapest 1997&lt;/ref&gt; in Tuvan - is personal to the shaman&lt;ref&gt;Mihály Hoppál, ''Studies on Eurasian Shamanism'' in ''Shamans and Cultures''  in Mihály Hoppál and Keith Howard eds pp258-288 Istor Budapest 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and tells of her or his birthplace, initiation, ancestral pedigree, special gifts and special connections to particular spirits. The melody and words are composed by the shaman and generally remain the same throughout the shaman's professional life.  The ''algysh'' is often sung near the beginning of the ritual and accompanied by drumming on the dungur drum. It serves to remind the shaman of their shamanic identity and power. It proclaims the shaman's abilities and announces the shaman to the spirits. In some traditions the shaman's song may be broken up into short sections, varied and recombined in different performances.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Humphrey, ''Shamans and elders''. Oxford, OUP1996,  p 235&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shaman's drum ==

The single headed frame [[frame drum|'''drum''']]  is widely used in shamanic ritual, often with metallic ritual objects dangling inside, held by an interior wooden cross-piece, and played with a special beater that may also itself be a rattle.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Hyder, ''Shamanism and Music in Siberia :  DRUM AND SPACE'' {{cite web |url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/musicanddance/projects/project6/essays/file45912.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622115511/http://www.soas.ac.uk/musicanddance/projects/project6/essays/file45912.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The drum will be made of consecrated materials, a specially chosen tree and the skin of a carefully chosen animal, sometimes by a specialist drum-maker. It will also have been 'enlivened' usually by a more powerful shaman so as to give it its spiritual properties.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Pegg, ''Mongolian Music, Dance and Oral Narrative'', University of Washington Press, 2001 p128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sevyan Vainshtein, ''The Tuvan Shaman's Drum and the ceremony of its Enlivening'', in V.Dioszegi (ed), ''Popular Beliefs and Folklore in Siberia'', Bloomington 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The head is sometimes decorated with a graphic typically representing the [[Religious cosmology|division of the cosmos into upper, middle and lower worlds]].  A shamanic ritual often begins with heating the drum head over a fire to bring it up to the desired pitch. A number of theories have been advanced to explain the importance of percussion in ritual music in general.&lt;ref&gt;Damian Walter, ''The Medium of the Message: Shamanism as Localised Practice in the Nepal Himalayas'' in ''The Archaeology of Shamanism'', ed Neil Price, Routledge 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Needham, ''Percussion and Transition'', Man 2:606-14. 1967&lt;/ref&gt;  One line of explanation is [[psychoacoustics|psychoacoustic]], whereby the tempo of the drum enables the shaman to enter the desired brain wave state, which corresponds to the number of beats per second of the drum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthlove.org/ECSTATIC%20TRANCE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105162700/http://www.earthlove.org/ECSTATIC%20TRANCE.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the case of shamanism, it seems that the portable drum is highly suited for a performance in which action and gesture are the top line.&lt;ref&gt;Roberte Hamayon, (in French)''Gestes et Sons, Chamane et Barde'',   in ''Chamanisme et Possession, Cahiers de Musiques Traditionelles 19'', Ateliers d'Ethnomusicologie, Genève, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The physical gesture of playing the drum is often integrated into a shamanic dance. For this reason the drumming is not restricted to regular tempo but may speed up and slow down with irregular accents.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hodgkinson, ''Siberian shamanism and improvised music'', Contemporary Music Review vol 14, parts 1-2, Netherlands, Harwood,1996, p62.&lt;/ref&gt; In some regions, the skin of a shaman's drum should be cut after his/her death.&lt;ref&gt;Mongush Kenin Lopsan,  ''Shamanic Songs and Myths of Tuva'' Istor Budapest 1997  p121&lt;/ref&gt; In others, not.&lt;ref&gt;Vilmos Diószegi,  ''Tracing Shamans in Siberia'' Anthropological Publications, Netherlands 1968, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shamanic groups ==

From the late 1980s with the loosening up of political restrictions a number of Siberian native cultures underwent a cultural renaissance, shamans began to practice openly again, and musicians formed '''bands''' drawing on shamanic traditions. Cholbon&lt;ref&gt;Henri Lecomte,(in French) ''Approches Autochtones du Chamanisme Sibérien au début du XXI Siècle'',  in ''Chamanisme et Possession, Cahiers de Musiques Traditionelles 19'', Ateliers d'Ethnomusicologie, Genève, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and AiTal,&lt;ref&gt;Aimar Ventsel, ''Sakha Pop Music'' p.10 http://www.princeton.edu/~restudy/soyuz_papers/Ventsel.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Sakha/Yakutsk, Biosyntes and early [[Yat-Kha]] in Tuva fall into this category. Nevertheless, the musicians involved, if sometimes unsure of their own exact role, recognized an important difference between artists using shamanic themes and shamans themselves. In the West bands began to apply the label 'shamanic' loosely to any music that might induce a trance state.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Howard, ''Sonic Transformations of  Shamanic Representations''  in AHRP Research Centre Newsletter 4, SOAS 2004, p19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terence McKenna, ''The Archaic revival''  Harper Collins 1991&lt;/ref&gt; This was partly due to the rarity of actual recordings of shamans' rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Rouget, ''Music and Trance'', University of Chicago Press 1985 p130&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the British-Tuvan group [[K-Space (band)|K-Space]] developed ways of combining improvisation, electronics and experimental recording and montage techniques with the more shamanic side of Tuvan traditional music. In Hungary [[Galloping Coroners|Vágtázó Halottkémek]]&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Milun quotes Anna Szemere: ''Up From the Underground - The Culture of Rock Music in Postsocialist Hungary'' Penn State Press 2001, http://www.pum.umontreal.ca/revues/surfaces/vol1/milun.html&lt;/ref&gt;(in English: Galloping Coroners) later [[Galloping Wonder Stag|Vágtázó Csodaszarvas]] set out under the banner of shamanpunk  to use ethnographic materials as manuals on how to reach and communicate ecstatic states. From 2005 Vágtázó Csodaszarvas (Galloping Wonder Stag) continued Vágtázó Halottkémek music philosophy turning it into a neotraditional music style closer to world music, replacing electronic guitars and drums with acoustic volk instruments.

== Korean shamanic music ==
{{See also|Korean shamanism}}

'''[[Korea]]''' is the only country where shamanism appears to have been a state religion practiced by the literate classes, during the Three Kingdoms Period (57BC-668AD). Under successive dynasties shamanism was gradually relegated to a popular or folk status with the arrival of Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. The early official status of shamanism is the probable explanation for the fact that shamanic ritual in Korea developed highly complex and established forms. Correspondingly the music used in shamanic rituals is more elaborate in Korea than elsewhere. Furthermore, since the emergence of Korean contemporary nationalism, there has been a strong and sustained state intervention to preserve artistic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Howard, ''Perspectives on Korean Music: Preserving Korean Music: Intangible Cultural Properties as Icons of Identity'' v. 1 (SOAS Musicology Series) 2006&lt;/ref&gt; All of these factors make it uniquely difficult in Korea to distinguish the 'pure' from hybrid and concert forms of shamanic ritual music. For example, ''[[Sinawi]]'' is a musical form that can be used in shamanic rituals, or to accompany folk dances, or for urban concert performance. In the ritual context ''Sinawi'' is often performed by a small ensemble with the ''changgo'' hour-glass drum and two melodic instruments, often the ''taegum'' flute and the ''[[piri]]'' oboe. In concert the ensemble is augmented with stringed instruments&lt;ref&gt;Kyo-Chul Chung  CD notes for ''Seoul Ensemble of Traditional Music'' World Network 12, WDR 54.039.&lt;/ref&gt;   Modern ''Sinawi'' is played in a minor mode in 12/8 time.&lt;ref&gt;CD notes for''A selection of Korean traditional music, volume 2''. Instrumental Music 2, SBCD-4380-2&lt;/ref&gt; The role of music in Korean shamanism seems intermediary between the possession trance model and the Siberian model: in the ''Kut'' ritual, the music, played by musicians, first calls on the god to possess the ''mudang'' (shaman), then accompanies the god during their time in the shaman's body, then sends back and placates the god at the end.&lt;ref&gt;''Shamanism, The Spirit World of Korea'', eds Chai-shin Yu and R.Guisso, Asian Humanities Press, Berkeley California 1988&lt;/ref&gt; However, the shaman is the singer and dancer and the shaman directs the musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Bo Hyeong CD notes for Kim Suk Chul Ensemble: ''Shamanistic Ceremonies of the Eastern Seaboard'',  JVC, VICG-5261 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bön shamanic music and Buddhist music ==

Before Buddhism came to Tibet, the local form of shamanism was '''[[Bön]]'''.  Bön developed into an organised religion. When Buddhism arrived, both religions began competing with each other, and incorporated many of each other's practices. The Bön shaman's drum on a pole became part of Tibetan Buddhist ritual music ensembles. Also, the shang - a kind of bell-cymbal - became incorporated in Buddhist rituals. It was formerly only used by shamans to clear away negative energy before shamanic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret J. Kartomi ''On concepts and classifications of musical instruments''University of Chicago Press, 1990 pp 75-83 {{ISBN|978-0-226-42549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frankperry.co.uk/Tibetan%20Bowls.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216183730/http://frankperry.co.uk/Tibetan%20Bowls.htm |archivedate=2009-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepathoflight.it/worken.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613215026/http://www.thepathoflight.it/worken.php |archivedate=2010-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The practice of giving a sonorous identity to deities, of calling them and sending them back by means of sounds, may well have entered Tibetan Buddhist ritual from Bön tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Helffer (in French)''Traditions musicales dans un monastère du Bouddhisme Tibétain'' in ''L'Homme 171-2'', Paris 2004 pp 183-184&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lifeshmoo.jpg|thumb|250 px]]
The '''shmoo''' (plural: '''shmoon''', also '''shmoos''') is a fictional [[cartoon]] creature created by [[Al Capp]] (1909–1979); the character first appeared in its classic [[comic strip]] ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' on August 31, 1948. The popular character has gone on to influence pop culture, language and even science. 
__TOC__

==Description==
A shmoo is shaped like a plump [[bowling pin]] with stubby legs. It has smooth skin, eyebrows and sparse whiskers—but no arms, nose or ears. Its feet are short and round but dextrous, as the shmoo's [[comic book]] adventures make clear. It has a rich gamut of facial expressions and often expresses love by exuding hearts over its head. [[Cartoonist]] Al Capp ascribed to the shmoo the following curious characteristics:
*They [[Asexual reproduction|reproduce asexually]] and are incredibly prolific, multiplying exponentially faster than rabbits. They require no sustenance other than air.
*Shmoos are delicious to eat, and are eager to be eaten. If a human looks at one hungrily, it will happily immolate itself—either by jumping into a frying pan, after which they taste like chicken, or into a broiling pan, after which they taste like steak. When roasted they taste like pork, and when baked they taste like catfish. (Raw, they taste like [[oyster]]s on the half-shell.)
*They also produce eggs (neatly packaged), milk (bottled, grade-A), and butter—no churning required. Their pelts make perfect bootleather or house timbers, depending on how thick one slices them.
*They have no bones, so there's absolutely no waste. Their eyes make the best [[suspenders|suspender]] buttons, and their [[Vibrissae|whiskers]] make perfect toothpicks. In short, they are simply the perfect ideal of a subsistence agricultural herd animal.
*Naturally gentle, they require minimal care, and are ideal playmates for young children. The frolicking of shmoon is so entertaining (such as their staged "shmoosical comedies") that people no longer feel the need to watch television or go to the [[film|movies]].
*Some of the more tasty varieties of shmoo are more difficult to catch. Usually shmoo hunters, now a sport in some parts of the country, utilize a paper bag, flashlight and stick to capture their shmoos. At night the light stuns them, then they can be whacked in the head with the stick and put in the bag for frying up later on.

==The original story==
{{TOC right}}
In a sequence beginning in late August 1948, Li'l Abner discovers the shmoos when he ventures into the forbidden "Valley of the Shmoon" following the mysterious and musical sound they make (from which their name derives). Abner is thrown off a cliff and into the valley below by a primitive "large gal" (as he addresses her), whose job is to guard the valley. (This character is never seen again.) There, against the frantic protestations of a naked, heavily bearded old man who shepherds the shmoos, Abner befriends the strange and charming creatures. "Shmoos", the old man warns, "is the greatest menace to hoomanity th' world has evah known!" "Thass becuz they is so bad, huh?" asks Li'l Abner. "No, ''stupid''", answers the man—and then encapsulates one of life's profound [[paradox]]es: "It's because they's so ''good!!''".

Having discovered their value ("Wif these around, nobody won't nevah havta work no more!!"), Abner leads the shmoos out of the valley—where they become a sensation in [[Dogpatch]] and, quickly, the rest of the world. Captains of industry such as J. Roaringham Fatback, the "Pork King", become alarmed as sales of nearly all products decline, and in a series of images reminiscent of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the "Shmoo Crisis" unfolds. On Fatback's orders, a corrupt exterminator orders out "Shmooicide Squads" to wipe out the shmoos with a variety of firearms, which is depicted in a macabre and comically graphic sequence, with a tearful Li'l Abner misguidedly saluting the supposed "authority" of the extermination squads.

After the shmoos have been eliminated, Dogpatch's extortionate grocer Soft-Hearted John is seen cackling as he displays his wares—rotting meat and produce: "Now them mizzuble starvin' rats has t'come crawlin t'me fo' the necessities o' life!! They complained 'bout mah prices befo'!! Wait'll they see th' new ones!!". The exterminator congratulates him.

However, it is soon discovered that Abner has secretly saved two shmoos, a "boy" and a "girl". The boy shmoo, as a Dogpatch native, is required to run from the girl shmoo in the annual [[Sadie Hawkins Day]] race. (Shmoos are usually portrayed as gender-neutral, although Capp sidesteps this issue to allow the comic plot twist.) When he is caught by her, in accordance with the rules of the race, they are joined in marriage by Marryin' Sam (whom they "pay" with a dozen eggs, two pounds of butter and six cupcakes with chocolate frosting—all of which Sam reckons to be worth about 98 cents). The already expanding shmoo family is last seen returning towards the Valley of the Shmoon.

The sequence, which ended just before [[Christmas]] of 1948, was massively popular, both as a commentary on the state of society and a classic [[allegory]] of greed and corruption tarnishing all that is good and innocent in the world. The Shmoo caused an unexpected national sensation, and set the stage for a major licensing phenomenon. In their very few subsequent appearances in ''Li'l Abner'', shmoos are also identified by the [[U.S. military]] as a major threat to [[national security]].

==Analysis==
{{quote|The Shmoo, any literate person must know, was one of history's most brilliant [[utopia]]n satires.|''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Pakenham |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-09-29/entertainment/0209290383_1_al-capp-harlan-ellison-abner |title=Editor's Choice: The Short Life and Happy Times of the Shmoo, by Al Capp, with an introduction by Harlan Ellison |work=Baltimore Sun |date=2002-11-29 |accessdate=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Capp is at his [[allegorical]] best in the epics of the Shmoos, and later, the Kigmies", wrote comic strip historian [[Jerry Robinson]] (in ''The Comics: An Illustrated History of Comic Strip Art'', 1974). "Shmoos are the world's most amiable creatures, supplying all man's needs. Like a [[fertility]] myth gone berserk, they reproduced so prodigiously they threatened to wreck the economy"—if not [[Western culture|western civilization]] as we know it, and ultimately [[society]] itself.

Al Capp offered his version of the origin of the Shmoo in a wryly satirical article, "I Don't Like Shmoos", in ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' (June 1949):

{{quote|I was driving from New York City to my farm in [[New Hampshire]]. The top of my car was down, and on either side of me I could see the lush and lovely [[New England]] countryside... It was the good earth at its generous summertime best, offering gifts to all. And the thought that came to me was this: Here we have this great and good and generous thing—the Earth. It's eager to give us everything we need. All we have to do is just let it alone, just be happy with it.

Cartoonists don't think like people. They think in pictures. Little pictures that will fit into a comic strip. And so, in my mind, I reduced the Earth... down to the size of a small critter that would fit into the ''Li'l Abner'' strip—and it came out a Shmoo... I didn't have any message—except that it's good to be alive. The Shmoo didn't have any social significance; it is simply a juicy li'l critter that gives milk and lays eggs... When you look at one as though you'd like to eat it, it dies of sheer ecstasy. And if one ''really'' loves you, it'll lay you a [[cheesecake]]—although this is quite a strain on its li'l innards...

I thought it was a perfectly ordinary little story, but when it appeared in newspapers, all hell broke loose! ''Life'', in an editorial, hailed the Shmoo as the very symbol and spirit of [[free enterprise]]. ''Time'' said I'd invented a new era of enlightened management-employee relationship, (they called it ''Capp''-italism.) ''[[The Daily Worker]]'' cussed me out as a Tool of the Bosses, and denounced the Shmoo as the [[Opium of the People|Opium of the Masses...]]}}

Superficially, the Shmoo story concerns a cuddly creature that desires nothing more than to be a boon to mankind. Although initially Capp denied or avoided discussion of any satirical intentions ("If the Shmoo fits", he proclaimed, "wear it!"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Search Site |url=http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_2_urb-al-capp.html |title=Exile in Dogpatch: The Curious Neglect of Cartoonist Al Capp, City Journal, Spring 2010 |publisher=City-journal.org |date=1934-08-13 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was widely seen to be stalking bigger game [[subtext]]ually.

The mythic tale ends on a deliberately [[irony|ironic]] note. Shmoos are officially declared a menace, and systematically hunted down and slaughtered—because they were deemed "bad for business". The much-copied storyline was a [[parable]] that was interpreted in many different ways at the outset of the [[Cold War]]. Al Capp was even invited to go on a radio show to debate [[socialist]] [[Norman Thomas]] on the effect of the Shmoo on modern [[capitalism]].

"After it came out both the left and the right attacked the Shmoo", according to publisher [[Denis Kitchen]]. "[[Communists]] thought he was making fun of socialism and [[Marxism]]. The [[right wing]] thought he was making fun of capitalism and [[the American way]]. Capp caught flak from both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,888467-1,00.html |title=Harvest Shmoon |magazine=Time |date=13 September 1948 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him it was an [[apolitical]] [[morality tale]] about [[human nature]]... I think [the Shmoo] was one of those bursts of genius. He was a genius, there's no question about that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=1114 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070623103614/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=1114 |archive-date=June 23, 2007 |title=''Everything and the Kitchen Shmoo:'' Interview with Denis Kitchen, April 2003 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shmoo inspired hundreds of "Shmoo clubs" all over North America. College students—who had made Capp's invented idea of the [[Sadie Hawkins dance]] a universally adopted tradition—flocked to the Shmoo as well. One school, the [[University of Bridgeport]], even launched the "American Society for the Advancement of the Shmoo" in early 1949.

Capp introduced many other allegorical creatures in ''Li'l Abner'' over the years—including '''[[Bald Iggles]], Kigmies, Nogoodniks, Mimikniks, the Money Ha-Ha, Shminks, Abominable Snow-Hams, Gobbleglops''' and '''Bashful Bulganiks''', among others. Each one highlighted another disquieting facet of human nature—but none have ever had quite the same cultural impact as the Shmoo. According to publisher Denis Kitchen: "For the rest of his career Capp got countless letters [from] people begging him to bring the Shmoo back. Periodically he would do it but each time it ended the same way—with the Shmoo being too good for humanity, and he had to essentially exterminate them again. But there was always one or two who would survive for future plot twists..."

==Etymology==
The actual origin of Capp's word "shmoo" has been the subject of debate by [[linguists]] for decades, leading to the misconception that the term was derived from "[[schmo]]" or "[[schmooze]]". However, "shmue" was a [[taboo]] [[Yiddish]] term for the [[uterus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6zPgjduXBcQC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;lpg=PA240&amp;dq=%22al+capp%22+yiddish+words&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Z7AHEHSII4&amp;sig=EcKDyys4rwnkrsnPiWEXz5huZ-4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result |title=Perspectives on American English |first=J. L. |last=Dillard |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1980 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of many Yiddish slang variations that would find their way into ''Li'l Abner''. Revealing an important key to the story, Al Capp himself wrote that the Shmoo metaphorically represented the limitless bounty of the earth in all its richness—in essence, [[Mother Nature]] herself. In Li'l Abner's words, "Shmoos ''hain't'' make believe. The hull [whole] earth is one!!"

==In science==
[[File:Shmoos s cerevisiae.jpg|thumb|''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' mating type '''a''' with shmoo responding to '''α'''-factor]]
The term "shmoo" has entered the English language, defining highly technical concepts in at least four separate fields of [[science]]:
* "[[Shmoo plot]]" is a technical term relating to the graphical display of test results in [[electrical engineering]], dating back at least to 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5217603/ |title=The Sensitivity Function in Variability Analysis |first=Charles |last=Belove |journal=[[IEEE]] Transactions on Reliability |volume=R-15 |issue=2 |year=1966 |pages=70–76 |doi=10.1109/TR.1966.5217603}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name most likely arose because the shape of the two-dimensional plots often resembled a shmoo. The term is also a verb: to "shmoo" means to run the test.
*In [[microbiology]], the shmoo's uncanny resemblance to budding [[mating of yeast|yeast]]—combined with its near-limitless usefulness—has led to the character's adoption as a mascot of sorts for scientists studying yeast as a [[model organism]] for [[genetics]] and [[cell biology]]. In fact, the cellular bulge that is produced by a [[haploid]] yeast cell as a response to a pheromone from the opposite mating type (either {{typo|a}} or α) is referred to as a "shmoo", because cells that are undergoing mating and present this particular structure resemble the cartoon character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/hoodedutilitarian/2010/12/strange-windows-keeping-up-with-the-goonses-part-3/#more-12736 |title=Strange Windows: Keeping up with the Goonses (part 3) |first=Alex |last=Buchet |date=18 December 2010 |website=The Hooded Utilitarian |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole process is known to biologists as "shmooing". Shmoos are essential; without them, we would have neither [[bread]] nor [[beer]]. The word "shmoo" has appeared in nearly 700 science publications since 1974; it is used in labs studying the bread- and beer-making species ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', (Source: ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' magazine, November 2007).
*It has been used in discussions of [[socioeconomics]], for instance. In [[economics]], a "[[widget (economics)|widget]]" is any material good which is produced through labor (extracted, refined, manufactured, or assembled) from a finite resource—in contrast to a "shmoo", which is a material good that reproduces itself and is captured or bred as an economic activity (the original shmoo reproduces without requiring any material sustenance). "If shmoos really existed, they would be a '[[free good]]'." [[Erik Olin Wright]] uses the "parable of the shmoo" to introduce discussion of class structure and economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YzuLVijEFbgC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=parable+of+the+shmoo&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Vz0OSRE-gC&amp;sig=EzcNyRciPN7rxlHhM3ljUD0Z7tE |last=Wright |first=Erik Olin |authorlink=Erik Olin Wright |title=Class Counts: Comparative Studies in Class Analysis |year=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Echinoderm]] biologists use "shmoo" (often spelled "schmoo") to refer to a very simple, highly derived, blob-shaped [[larva]] found in some [[sea urchin]]s (e.g. Wray 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gregory A. Wray |url=http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/45/3/308.short |title=Parallel Evolution of Nonfeeding Larvae in Echinoids |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=45 |issue=3 |year=1996 |pages=308–322 |doi=10.1093/sysbio/45.3.308 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
*In the field of [[particle physics]], "shmoo" refers to a high energy [[cosmic ray]] survey instrument utilized at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] for the [[Cygnus X-3]] Sky Survey performed at the LAMPF (Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility) grounds. Over one hundred white "shmoo" detectors were at one time sprinkled around the accelerator beamstop area and adjacent mesa to capture subatomic cosmic ray particles emitted from the [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] [[constellation]]. The detectors housed [[scintillator]]s and [[photomultiplier]]s in an array that gave the detector its distinctive shmoo shape. The particle accelerator [[Tevatron]] at [[Fermilab]] houses superconducting magnets which produce ice formations that also resembled shmoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Higgins |first=William S. |url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/cms/?pid=1000966 |title=Shmoos of the Tevatron |magazine=Symmetry |date=June 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The shmoo has been suggested as a hypothetical example of the potential [[falsifiability]] of [[natural selection]] as a key driving mechanism of [[biological evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;

An unexpected—and virtually unprecedented—postwar merchandising phenomenon followed Capp's introduction of the Shmoo in ''Li'l Abner''. As in the strip, shmoos suddenly appeared to be everywhere in 1949 and 1950—including a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' cover story. They also garnered nearly a full page of coverage (under "Economics") in ''Time's'' International section. Major articles also ran in ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'' and countless other publications and newspapers. Virtually overnight, as a ''Life'' headline put it, "The U.S. Becomes Shmoo-Struck!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_kgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=life+magazine+shmoo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zkzHLwx3TW&amp;sig=nVW43cHolwZepvLo6JSyEhIEUIQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Cq06TdTZFov2tgP8uLD9Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The U.S. Becomes Shmoo-Struck! |magazine=Life |date=20 September 1948 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A garment factory in [[Baltimore]] turned out a whole line of shmoo apparel, including "Shmooveralls". In 1948, people danced to the Shmoo [[Rhumba]] and the Shmoo [[Polka]]. The Shmoo briefly entered everyday language through such phrases as "What's Shmoo?" and "Happy Shmoo Year!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essortment.com/all/alcappshmoo_rxvq.htm |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522213154/http://www.essortment.com/all/alcappshmoo_rxvq.htm |archive-date=2009-05-22 |title=Al Capp's Shmoo |website=Essortment.com |date=1986-05-16 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Close to a hundred licensed shmoo products from 75 different manufacturers were produced in less than a year, some of which sold ''five million units'' each.&lt;ref&gt;''Newsweek'', 5 September 1949; and ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'', 16 July 1949&lt;/ref&gt; In a single year, shmoo merchandise generated over $25&amp;nbsp;million in sales in 1948 dollars (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|25|1948|fmt=c}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}).&lt;ref name="deniskitchen.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deniskitchen.com/docs/new_shmoofacts.html |title=The Shmoo Fact Sheet |first=Denis |last=Kitchen |publisher=Deniskitchen.com |year=2004 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shmoo was so popular it even replaced [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Mickey Mouse]] as the face of the Children's [[United States Treasury security#Nonmarketable securities|Savings Bond]], issued by the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] in 1949. The valid document was colorfully illustrated with Capp's character, and promoted by the [[Federal Government of the United States]] with a $16&amp;nbsp;million advertising campaign budget. According to one article at the time, the Shmoo showed "Thrift, loyalty, trust, duty, truth and common ''cents'' [that] add up to aid to his nation". Al Capp accompanied President [[Harry S. Truman]] at the bond's unveiling ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fishinghistory.blogspot.com/2008/09/shmoo-part-i.html |title=The Shmoo Part I |first=T. E.

===Comic books and reprints===
''The Life and Times of the Shmoo'' (1948), a paperback collection of the original sequence, was a bestseller for [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] and became the first cartoon book to achieve serious literary attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,886491,00.html |title=The Miracle of Dogpatch |magazine=Time |date=27 December 1948 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distributed to small town magazine racks, it sold 700,000 copies in its first year of publication alone. It was reviewed coast to coast alongside [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s ''[[Crusade in Europe]]'' (the other big publication at the time).

The idea was reportedly abandoned in the development stage by the producers, however, for reasons of practicality. A variation of the character had earlier appeared as a [[marionette]] puppet on television. "Shmoozer", a talking shmoo with an anthropomorphic human body, was a recurring [[sidekick]] character on ''[[Fearless Fosdick]]'', a short-lived puppet series that aired on NBC-TV in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389616/epcast Fearless Fosdick (TV show) at IMDB]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Capp's death in 1979, the Shmoo gained its own [[Animated television series|animated series]] as part of ''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'' (which consisted of reruns of ''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]'' mixed with the Shmoo's own cartoons; the two pairs of characters didn't actually "meet"). The characters ''did'' meet, however, in the early 1980s Flintstones [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''. The Shmoo appeared, incongruously, in the segment ''Bedrock Cops'' as a police officer alongside part-time officers [[Fred Flintstone]] and [[Barney Rubble]]. Needless to add, this Shmoo had little relationship to the ''L'il Abner'' character, other than a superficial appearance. A later [[Hanna-Barbera]] venture, ''[[The New Shmoo]]'', featured the character as an (inexplicably) shape-shifting mascot of Mighty Mysteries Comics, a group of teens who solve ''[[Scooby-Doo]]''-like mysteries. In this series the Shmoo could magically "morph" into any shape at will—like ''[[Tom Terrific]]''. None of these revisionist revivals of the venerable character was particularly successful.

==In popular culture==
*[[Frank Sinatra]], who was frequently spoofed by Al Capp in ''Li'l Abner'', has a line in the [[MGM]] musical ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]'' (1949) about cops "multiplyin' like shmoos!"
*[[Florence King]] refers to owning a ceramic shmoo, which she threw out of her window after reading the books of [[Ayn Rand]].
*In the 1990 movie ''[[Book of Love (1990 film)|Book of Love]]'', the character Crutch wins a stuffed shmoo at a carnival.
*In the ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' TV episode "Who Knew?", [[Colonel Potter]] (played by [[Harry Morgan]]) displays an inflatable shmoo toy in his office that he purchased for his grandson.
*In [[Larry Niven]]'s ''[[Known Space]]'' stories, an alien species known as the [[Bandersnatch (Known Space)|Bandersnatch]], also edible and intelligent, is described as being "smooth as a shmoo".
*In the novel ''[[The Forge of God]]'' by [[Greg Bear]], "Shmoo" is the name humans give to the race of [[robots]] that visits Earth, due to their similar shape.
*Some overlapping similarities exist between shmoos and [[tribble]]s—the multitudinous alien creatures featured in a 1967 TV episode from the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original ''Star Trek'']].  Like shmoos, tribbles ''also'' reproduced at such an alarming rate, they threatened ecological disaster. However, [[David Gerrold]]—who wrote "[[The Trouble With Tribbles]]"—drew his inspiration from an actual event: Australia's environmentally destructive [[rabbit]] overpopulation.
*The characters Gleep and Gloop—two protoplastic creatures from the [[Hanna-Barbera]] [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday morning]] [[animated cartoon]] series ''[[The Herculoids]]''—were clearly inspired by (and are sometimes mistaken for) shmoos.
*French artists [[Etienne Chambaud]] and David Jourdan have written "Economie de l'abondance ou La courte vie et les jours heureux", a new adventure of ''[[Jacques le fataliste et son maître]]'' from [[Diderot]], based on the discovery by Jacques of the Shmoo.
*In the 2006 film ''[[Lucky Number Slevin]]'', the character known only as "The Boss" (played by [[Morgan Freeman]]) refers to the Shmoo, recounting its original features as a source of plenty (in a monologue taken from an old ''Li'l Abner'' comic).
* The [[Marxist]] political philosopher [[Gerald Cohen]] used the story of the Shmoo to illustrate his objections to capitalism in an episode of ''Opinions''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA9WPQeow9c |title=G. A. Cohen – Against Capitalism – Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-02-02 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Simpsons]]'' uses a statue of the Shmoo to replace the giant phallic statue from the film [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|''A Clockwork Orange'']] in the episode "[[Treehouse of Horror XXV]]".
* In the North American version video game, ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'' there is an enemy monster called "''Schmoo''" (in the original Japanese version it is an [[Obake]] called "''Kyuu''" a homage to the character in manga, [[Obake no Q-tarō]]) which is apparently a homage to The Shmoo. Schmoo appear in the Forbidden Library and killing one may result in obtaining the rare sword "''Crissaegrim''" (its rare item drop), one of the most powerful swords in the game.
*During the Soviet Union's blockade of [[West Berlin]], Germany in 1948, candy-filled shmoos were air-dropped to hungry West Berliners from transport planes by America's 17th Military Airport Squadron. The commanders of the Berlin airlift had cabled Capp, requesting the inflatable shmoos as part of Operation: Little Vittles.  "When the candy-chocked shmoos were dropped, a near-riot resulted...."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Newsweek]]'', 11 October 1948&lt;/ref&gt;
*Shmoos invaded the [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948 presidential election]], as challenger [[Thomas Dewey]] accused incumbent [[Harry S. Truman]] of "promising everything, including the Shmoo!"&lt;ref&gt;''Newsweek'', 5 September 1948&lt;/ref&gt;
*Capp periodically reintroduced the Shmoos in ''Li'l Abner'', sometimes with significant variations. "Bad" Shmoos (called "Nogoodniks") debuted in a series of Sunday strips in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/public/default.asp?t=1&amp;m=1&amp;c=34&amp;s=264&amp;ai=41615&amp;arch=y&amp;ssd=8/24/2002%2012:01:00%20PM |title=Bad Shmoos from The Scoop Archive, 24 August 2002 |publisher=Scoop.diamondgalleries.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nasty cousin of the good-natured Shmoo, Nogoodniks were a sickly shade of green, and had "li'l red eyes, sharp yaller teeth, an' a dirty look". Frequently sporting [[5 o'clock shadow]]s, eye patches, scars, bandages and other ruffian attributes—they devoured "good" Shmoos, were the sworn enemies of "hoomanity", and wreaked havoc on Dogpatch.
*In the ABC sitcom ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'', Beverley Goldberg endearingly refers to her children as Shmoos.

}}The '''Society for Earthquake and Civil Engineering Dynamics''' (SECED) was founded in 1969 to promote the study and practice of [[earthquake engineering]] and structural dynamics, including blast, impact and other vibration problems. It also supports study of societal and economic ramifications of major earthquakes.&lt;ref name="SECED"&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.seced.org.uk/|website=SECED|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the British branch of both the International Association (IAEE) and the European Association of Earthquake Engineering (EAEE).&lt;ref name="PreventionWeb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Society for Earthquake and Civil Engineering Dynamics (SECED)|url=http://www.preventionweb.net/organizations/13192|website=Prevention Web|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an Associated Society of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] (ICE), and is sponsored by the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] (IMechE), the [[Institution of Structural Engineers]] (IStructE) and the [[Geological Society of London|Geological Society]].&lt;ref name="SECED" /&gt;

SECED has organised conferences and lectures (see below). It hosted a 2002 European conference on earthquake engineering in London, and in July 2015 hosted a two-day conference at [[Homerton College]], [[Cambridge]] titled ''Earthquake Risk and Engineering towards a Resilient World''.&lt;ref name="Conf"&gt;{{cite web|title=SECED 2015 Conference|url=https://www.jillrogersassociates.co.uk/seced-home.html|website=Jill Rogers Associates|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also organises regular meetings and has published a newsletter since 1987.

==Mallet–Milne lectures==
It organises the biennial [[Mallet–Milne Lecture]], named after [[Robert Mallet]] and [[John Milne]], regarded as the founding fathers of engineering [[seismology]].&lt;ref name="SECED" /&gt; The inaugural lecture was given at the ICE in London on 27 May 1987.&lt;ref name=SSA&gt;Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, Vol.77, No.2, pp.688-689, April 1987.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7166">A '''story arc''' (also '''narrative arc''')&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-narrative-arc-in-literature-852484 "Narrative Arc – What is Narrative Arc in Literature?"]. ThoughtCo.&lt;/ref&gt; is an extended or continuing [[narrative|storyline]] in [[episode|episodic]] storytelling media such as [[television]], [[comic book]]s, [[comic strip]]s, [[boardgames]], [[video game]]s, and [[films]] with each episode following a [[dramatic arc]]. On a [[television program]], for example, the story would unfold over many episodes. In television, the use of the story arc is much more common in [[comedy|comedies]], especially in [[soap opera]]s. In a traditional Hollywood film, the story arc usually follows a three-act format.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Lew, "Lew Hunter's Screenwriting 434: The Industry's Premier Teacher Reveals the Secrets of the Successful Screenplay", Peregee Books, a division of Penguin, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Webcomic]]s are more likely to use story arcs than [[comic strip|newspaper comics]], as most web comics have readable archives online that a newcomer to the strip can read in order to understand what is going on. Although story arcs have existed for decades, the term "story arc" was coined in 1988 in relation to the television series ''[[Wiseguy]]'',{{clarification needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Boulware, Hugh (September 18, 1988). [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-09-18/entertainment/8802010198_1_wiseguy-ken-wahl-sonny-steelgrave "Hollywood Not Ken Wahl's Kind Of Town"]. ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and was quickly adapted for other uses.

Many American comic book series are now written in four or six-issue arcs, within a continuing series. Short story arcs are easier to package as [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]s for resale, and more accessible to the casual reader than the never-ending [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] that once characterised US comics.
A corollary to the absence of continuity, however, is that, as exemplified in 1950s DC ''Superman'' comics, no permanent change to characters or situations occurs, meaning no growth can take place; thus storylines repeat over time in an endless loop.

==Dramatic structure and purpose==
The purpose of a story arc is to move a character or a situation from one state to another; in other words, to [[Peripeteia|effect change]]. This change or transformation often takes the form of either a [[tragedy|tragic]] fall from grace or a reversal of that pattern. One common form in which this reversal is found is a character going from a situation of weakness to one of strength. For example, a poor woman goes on adventures and in the end makes a fortune for herself, or a lonely man falls in love and marries.

Another form of storytelling that offers a change or transformation of [[Character arc|character]] is that of "hero's journey," as laid out in [[Joseph Campbell]]'s theory of the [[monomyth]] in his work, ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. [[Christopher Vogler]]'s ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers]]'' details the same theory specifically for western storytelling.

Story arcs in contemporary drama often follow the pattern of bringing a character to a low point, removing the structures the character depends upon, and then forcing the character to find new strength without those structures. In a story arc, the character undergoes substantial growth or change, which culminates in the [[denouement]] in the last third or quarter of a story.

==In television and radio==
{{See also|Serial (radio and television)}}
Story arcs on television (and also on radio) have existed for decades (one notable (albeit, unusual) example, from the so-called "Golden Age of Radio", being the 1946 [[NBC Red Network|NBC Radio]] Summer-run docudrama serial, ''The Fifth Horseman'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/The_Fifth_Horseman|title=The Fifth Horseman|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; which (in part) featured a four-episode arc regarding a hypothetical chain of events (spanning nearly two full "future" decades) surrounding a fictitious [[nuclear holocaust]]), and are common in many countries where multi-episode storylines are the norm (an example being the UK's ''[[Doctor Who]]''), as well as most [[anime]] series.

Many arc-based series in past decades, such as ''[[V (1984 TV series)|V]]'', were often short-lived and found it difficult to attract new viewers; they also rarely appear in traditional [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] (one notable example being the science fiction "novel for television" ''[[Babylon 5]]''). However, the rise of [[DVD]] retail and [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] of television series has worked in arc-based productions' favor as the standard season collection format allows the viewer to have easy access to the relevant episodes. One area of television where story arcs have always thrived, however, is in the realm of the soap opera, and often episodic series have been derisively referred to as "soap operas" when they have adopted story arcs.

Arc-based series draw and reward dedicated viewers, and fans of a particular show follow and discuss different story arcs independently from particular episodes. Story arcs are sometimes split into subarcs, if deemed significant by fans, making it easy to refer to certain episodes if their production order titles are unknown. Episodes not relevant to story arcs (such as "monsters of the week") are sometimes dismissed as [[filler (media)|filler]] by fans, but might be referred to as self-contained or stand-alone episodes by producers.

===Usage in manga and anime===
[[Manga]] and anime are usually good examples of arc-based stories, to the point that most series shorter than twenty-six chapters are a single arc spanning all the chapters. This makes syndication difficult, as episodes watched in isolation often confuse viewers unless watched in conjunction with the series as a whole. Series of thirty chapters or longer usually have multiple arcs.

''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (TV)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', for example, is a single story arc spanning twenty-six episodes. Other longer anime have multiple story arcs, such as ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'', ''[[Higurashi When They Cry|Higurashi no Naku Koro ni]]'', ''[[One Piece]]'', ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' and ''[[Fairy Tail]]''. The anime ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' adapts four different story arcs from the ''Dragon Ball'' manga, each with its own ultimate antagonist, along with original story arcs created for the TV series.

A '''stressor''' is a chemical or [[biological agent]], [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] condition, [[Stimulus (physiology)|external stimulus]] or an event that causes [[Stress (biology)|stress]] to an [[biological organism|organism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sato|first1=Tadatoshi|last2=Yamamoto|first2=Hironori|last3=Sawada|first3=Naoki|last4=Nashiki|first4=Kunitaka|last5=Tsuji|first5=Mitsuyoshi|last6=Muto|first6=Kazusa|last7=Kume|first7=Hisae|last8=Sasaki|first8=Hajime|last9=Arai|first9=Hidekazu|last10=Nikawa|first10=Takeshi|last11=Taketani|first11=Yutaka|last12=Takeda|first12=Eiji|title=Restraint stress alters the duodenal expression of genes important for lipid metabolism in rat|journal=Toxicology|date=October 2006|volume=227|issue=3|pages=248–261|doi=10.1016/j.tox.2006.08.009|pmid=16962226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologically speaking, a stressors can be events or environments that an individual would consider demanding, challenging, and or threaten the individual's safety.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Deckers, Lambert (2018). Motivation Biological, Psychological, and Environmental. New York, NY: Routledge. pp. 208-

An event that triggers the [[stress response]] may include:
* environmental stressors ([[:en:Hypothermia|hypo]] or [[:en:Hyperthermia|hyper]]-thermic [[:en:Thermoregulation|temperatures]], [[noise health effects|elevated sound levels]], [[over-illumination]], [[overcrowding]])
* daily stress events (e.g., [[traffic]], lost keys, money, quality and quantity of physical activity)
* life changes (e.g., [[divorce]], bereavement)
* workplace stressors (e.g., high job demand vs. low job control, repeated or sustained exertions, forceful exertions, extreme postures)
* chemical stressors (e.g., [[tobacco]], [[alcohol]], drugs{{Specify |reason=Please provide specific examples. |date=March 2018}})
* social stressor (e.g., societal and family demands)

Stressors have physical, chemical and mental responses inside of the body. Physical stressors produce mechanical stresses on skin, bones, ligaments, tendons, muscles and nerves that cause tissue deformation and in extreme cases tissue failure.  Chemical stresses also produce biomechanical responses associated with [[metabolism]] and tissue repair. Physical stressors may produce pain and impair work performance.  Chronic pain and impairment requiring medical attention may result from extreme physical stressors or if there is not sufficient recovery time between successive exposures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Research Council|title=Musculoskeletal Disorders and the Workplace: Low Back and Upper Extremities. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press|year=2001|publisher=National Academey Press|isbn=0-309-07284-0|pages=512|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Research Council|title=Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders: Report, Workshop Summary, and Workshop Papers|year=199|publisher=National Academy Press|isbn=0-309-06397-3|pages=240|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=6431d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stressors may also affect mental function and performance. One possible mechanism involves stimulation of the [[hypothalamus]], CRF ([[corticotropin release factor]]) -&gt; [[pituitary gland]] releases ACTH ([[adrenocorticotropic hormone]]) -&gt; [[adrenal cortex]] secretes various stress hormones (e.g., [[cortisol]]) -&gt; [[stress hormone]]s (30 varieties) travel in the blood stream to relevant [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], e.g., [[glands]], [[heart]], [[intestines]] -&gt; [[flight-or-fight response]]. Between this flow there is an alternate path that can be taken after the stressor is transferred to the [[hypothalamus]], which leads to the sympathetic [[nervous system]]. After which, the [[adrenal medulla]] secretes [[epinephrine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Stress?|url=http://www.s-cool.co.uk/a-level/psychology/stress/revise-it/what-is-stress|publisher=S-Cool}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental and social stressors may affect behavior and how individuals respond to physical and chemical stressors.

Life requires everyone to make sudden and planned adjustments to meet its demands, but the greater the demand comes with a greater adjustment and possibly more stress. Determining the impact of these various stressors allow individuals to decide the relationship between the types of stressors and the degree of distress. Identifying the stressor-stress relationship must involve quantifying the impact of life demands and all stress spurred from it. To do this, subjective measures and objective measures will be used depending on the situation. Individuals determine the degree of adjustment themselves in subjective measures, but a degree of adjustment will be or has already been assigned to the individual in an objective measure. The degrees of adjustment are measured by life change units, where one unit equals a degree of adjustment necessary to cope with the life change. The practice of measuring life change units led to the creation of many scales composed of these units that are tailored to certain life events or situations, such as social readjustment and college students &lt;ref&gt;Deckers Page 215&lt;/ref&gt;. 
	Once the relationship between the stressor (event) and the stress, the individual can then begin to focus on the stress magnitude and the stress itself. For life events with a lower magnitude of impact, the ability to cope and adjust may not be very complex and relatively brief. But for others, life events with high magnitudes can impact their lives in many ways for an extended amount of time. The various stressors listed above can all have events or stressors that range anywhere from minor to traumatic. Traumatic events are very debilitating stressors, and often times these stressors are uncontrollable. Traumatic events can deplete an individual’s coping resources to an extent where the individual may develop acute stress disorder or even post-traumatic stress disorder. Acute stress disorder is a psychological disorder where a traumatic event that is life threatening or threatens an injury causes a reaction of fear and helplessness lasting up to four weeks. Post-traumatic stress disorder has symptoms of lasting longer than one month, and the first symptom is a history of experiencing a traumatic event followed with a reaction of intense fear, helplessness, or horror. The traumatic event is persistently reexperienced in one of these ways: recurrent distressing recollections, dreams, flashbacks, illusions, or a sense of reliving the experience, and distress or physical arousal by reminders of this event. The individual suffers from a persistent avoidance of reminders of the event. People who have been abused, victimized, or terrorized are often more susceptible to stress disorders &lt;ref&gt;Deckers Page 216&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Nevid, Spencer, and Greene, et al., 2014&lt;/ref&gt;. 
	No matter the magnitude of the stressor and stress, most stressor-stress relationships can be evaluated and determined by either the individual or a psychologist. Without proper attention, stress can produce severe effects on mental health and the immune system, which can eventually lead to effects on the physical body. Therapeutic measures are often taken to help replenish and rebuild the individual’s coping resources while simultaneously aiding the individual in dealing with the current stressor. 

'''Psychological Stressors''' 

Stressors occur when an individual is unable to cope with the demands of their environment (such as crippling debt with no clear path to resolving it).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Generally, stressors take many forms, such as: traumatic events, life demands, sudden medical emergencies, and daily inconveniences, to name a few. There are also a variety of characteristics that a stressor may possess (different durations, intensity, predictability, and controllability).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Predictability and Controllability'''

When individuals are informed about events before they occur, the magnitude of the stressor is less than when compared to individuals who were not informed of the stressor.&lt;ref&gt;Grillon, C., Baas, J. P., Lissen, S., Smith, K., &amp; Milstein, J. (2004). Anxious responses to predictable and unpredictable aversive events. Behavioral Neuroscience, 2004, 118, 916-924.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an individual would prefer to know when they have a deadline ahead of time in order to prepare for it in advance, rather than find out about the deadline the day of. In knowing that there is a deadline ahead of time, the intensity of the stressor is smaller for the individual, as opposed to the magnitude of intensity for the other unfortunate individual who found out about the deadline the day of. When this was tested, psychologists found that when given the choice, individuals had a preference for the predictable stressors, rather than the unpredictable stressors.&lt;ref&gt;Lejuez, C. W., Eifert, G. H., Zvolensky, M. J., &amp; Richards, J. B. (2000). Preference between onset predictable and unpredictable administrations of 20 percent carbon-dioxide-enriched air: Implications for better understanding the etiology and treatment of panic disorder. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 6, 349-358.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the degree to which the stressor can be controlled plays a variable in how the individual perceives stress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Research has found that if an individual is able to take some control over the stressor, then the level of stress will be decreased. During this study, it was found that the individuals become increasingly anxious and distressed if they were unable to control their environment.&lt;ref&gt;Zvolensky M. J., Eifert, G. H., &amp; Lejuez, C. W. (2001). Offset control during recurrent 20 percent carbon-dioxide- enriched air induction: Relation to individual difference variables. Emotion, 1, 148-165.&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, imagine an individual who detests baths in the Middle Ages, taking a bath. If the individual was forced to take the bath with no control over the temperature of the bath (one of the variables), then their anxiety and stress levels would be higher than if the individual was given some control over the environment (such as being able to control the temperature of the water).

Based on these two principles (predictability and control), there are two hypotheses that attempt to account for these preferences; the preparatory response hypothesis and safety hypothesis attempt to accommodate these preferences.

'''Preparatory Response Hypothesis'''

The idea behind this hypothesis is that an organism can better prepare for an event if they are informed beforehand, as this allows them to prepare for it (biologically).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In biologically preparing for this event beforehand, the individual is able to better decrease the event's aversiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, C. C. (1955). The stimulus conditions which follow learned responses. Psychological Review, 62, 341-348.&lt;/ref&gt; In knowing when a potential stressor will occur (such as an exam), the individual could, in theory, prepare for it in advance, thus decreasing the stress that may result from that event.

'''Safety Hypothesis'''

In this hypothesis, there are two time periods, one in which is deemed safe (where there is no stressor), and one which is deemed unsafe (in which the stressor is present).&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M. E. P. (1971). Phobias and preparedness. Behavior Therapy, 2, 207-320.&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to procrastination and cramming; during the safe intervals (weeks before an exam) the individual is relaxed and not anxious, and during the unsafe intervals (the day or night before the exam) the individual most likely experiences stress and anxiety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Structural genomics''' seeks to describe the [[Protein Structure|3-dimensional structure]] of every protein encoded by a given [[genome]]. This genome-based approach allows for a high-throughput method of structure determination by a combination of [[protein structure prediction|experimental and modeling approaches]]. The principal difference between structural genomics and [[protein structure prediction|traditional structural prediction]] is that structural genomics attempts to determine the structure of every protein encoded by the genome, rather than focusing on one particular protein. With full-genome sequences available, structure prediction can be done more quickly through a combination of experimental and modeling approaches, especially because the availability of large number of sequenced genomes and previously solved protein structures allows scientists to model protein structure on the structures of previously solved homologs.

Because protein structure is closely linked with protein function, the structural genomics has the potential to inform knowledge of protein function. In addition to elucidating protein functions, structural genomics can be used to identify novel protein folds and potential targets for drug discovery. Structural genomics involves taking a large number of approaches to structure determination, including experimental methods using genomic sequences or modeling-based approaches based on sequence or [[homology modeling|structural homology]] to a protein of known structure or based on chemical and physical principles for a protein with no homology to any known structure.

As opposed to traditional [[structural biology]], the determination of a [[protein structure]] through a structural genomics effort often (but not always) comes before anything is known regarding the protein function. This raises new challenges in [[structural bioinformatics]], i.e. determining protein function from its [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] structure.

Structural genomics emphasizes high throughput determination of protein structures. This is performed in dedicated [[Protein Structure Initiative#External links|centers of structural genomics]].

While most structural biologists pursue structures of individual proteins or protein groups, specialists in structural genomics pursue structures of proteins on a genome wide scale. This implies large-scale cloning, expression and purification. One main advantage of this approach is economy of scale. On the other hand, the scientific value of some resultant structures is at times questioned. A ''Science'' article from January 2006 analyzes the structural genomics field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chandonia JM, Brenner SE |title=The impact of structural genomics: expectations and outcomes |journal=Science |volume=311 |issue=5759 |pages=347–51 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16424331 |doi=10.1126/science.1121018 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5759/347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One advantage of structural genomics, such as the [[Protein Structure Initiative]], is that the scientific community gets immediate access to new structures, as well as to reagents such as clones and protein. A disadvantage is that many of these structures are of proteins of unknown function and do not have corresponding publications. This requires new ways of communicating this structural information to the broader research community. The Bioinformatics core of the Joint center for structural genomics (JCSG) has recently developed a wiki-based approach namely [[Open protein structure annotation network]] (TOPSAN) for annotating protein structures emerging from high-throughput structural genomics centers.

== Goals==
One goal of structural genomics is to identify novel protein folds. Experimental methods of protein structure determination require proteins that express and/or crystallize well, which may inherently bias the kinds of proteins folds that this experimental data elucidate. A genomic, modeling-based approach such as [[de novo protein structure prediction|''ab initio'' modeling]] may be better able to identify novel protein folds than the experimental approaches because they are not limited by experimental constraints.

Protein function depends on 3-D structure and these 3-D structures are more highly conserved than [[peptide sequence|sequences]]. Thus, the high-throughput structure determination methods of structural genomics have the potential to inform our understanding of protein functions.  This also has potential implications for drug discovery and protein engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kuhn P, Wilson K, Patch MG, Stevens RC |title=The genesis of high-throughput structure-based drug discovery using protein crystallography |journal=Curr Opin Chem Biol |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=704–10 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12413557 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1367593102003617 |doi=10.1016/S1367-5931(02)00361-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, every protein that is added to the structural database increases the likelihood that the database will include homologous sequences of other unknown proteins. The [[Protein Structure Initiative]] (PSI) is a multifaceted effort funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]] with various academic and industrial partners that aims to increase knowledge of protein structure using a structural genomics approach and to improve structure-determination methodology.

== Methods ==
Structural genomics takes advantage of completed genome sequences in several ways in order to determine protein structures.  The gene sequence of the target protein can also be compared to a known sequence and structural information can then be inferred from the known protein’s structure. Structural genomics can be used to predict novel protein folds based on other structural data.  Structural genomics can also take modeling-based approach that relies on homology between the unknown protein and a solved protein structure.

=== ''de novo'' methods ===
Completed genome sequences allow every [[open reading frame]] (ORF), the part of a gene that is likely to contain the sequence for the [[messenger RNA]] and protein, to be cloned and expressed as protein. These proteins are then purified and crystallized, and then subjected to one of two types of structure determination: [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR).  The whole genome sequence allows for the design of every primer required in order to amplify all of the ORFs, clone them into bacteria, and then express them.  By using a whole-genome approach to this traditional method of protein structure determination, all of the proteins encoded by the genome can be expressed at once.  This approach allows for the structural determination of every protein that is encoded by the genome.

=== Modelling-based methods===

==== ''ab initio''  modeling====
This approach uses protein sequence data and the chemical and physical interactions of the encoded amino acids to predict the 3-D structures of proteins with no homology to solved protein structures. One highly successful method for ''ab initio'' modeling is the [[Rosetta@home|Rosetta]] program, which divides the protein into short segments and arranges short polypeptide chain into a low-energy local conformation.  Rosetta is available for commercial use and for non-commercial use through its public program, Robetta.

====Sequence-based modeling====
This modeling technique compares the gene sequence of an unknown protein with sequences of proteins with known structures. Depending on the degree of similarity between the sequences, the structure of the known protein can be used as a model for solving the structure of the unknown protein. Highly accurate modeling is considered to require at least 50% amino acid sequence identity between the unknown protein and the solved structure. 30-50% sequence identity gives a model of intermediate-accuracy, and sequence identity below 30% gives low-accuracy models.  It has been predicted that at least 16,000 protein structures will need to be determined in order for all structural motifs to be represented at least once and thus allowing the structure of any unknown protein to be solved accurately through modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baker D, Sali A |title=Protein structure prediction and structural genomics |journal=Science |volume=294 |issue=5540 |pages=93–6 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11588250 |doi=10.1126/science.1065659 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11588250}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One disadvantage of this method, however, is that structure is more conserved than sequence and thus 	sequence-based modeling may not be the most accurate way to predict protein structures.

====Threading====
[[Threading (protein sequence)|Threading]] bases structural modeling on fold similarities rather than sequence identity.  This method may help identify distantly related proteins and can be used to infer molecular functions.

== Examples of structural genomics ==
There are currently a number of on-going efforts to solve the structures for every protein in a given proteome.

===''Thermotogo maritima'' proteome===
One current goal of the [[Joint Center for Structural Genomics]] (JCSG), a part of the [[Protein Structure Initiative]] (PSI) is to solve the structures for all the proteins in ''[[Thermotoga|Thermotogo maritima]]'', a thermophillic bacterium. ''T. maritima'' was selected as a structural genomics target based on its relatively small genome consisting of 1,877 genes and the hypothesis that the proteins expressed by a thermophilic bacterium would be easier to crystallize.

Lesley ''et al'' used ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' to express all the open-reading frames (ORFs) of ''T. martima''. These proteins were then crystallized and structures were determined for successfully crystallized proteins using X-ray crystallography.  Among other structures, this structural genomics approach allowed for the determination of the structure of the TM0449 protein, which was found to exhibit a novel fold as it did not share structural homology with any known protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lesley SA, Kuhn P, Godzik A, etal |title=Structural genomics of the Thermotoga maritima proteome implemented in a high-throughput structure determination pipeline |journal=Proc.

U.S.A. |volume=99 |issue=18 |pages=11664–9 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12193646 |pmc=129326 |doi=10.1073/pnas.142413399 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12193646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' proteome===
The goal of the [[Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Structural Genomics Consortium|TB Structural Genomics Consortium]] is to determine the structures of potential drug targets in ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. The development of novel drug therapies against tuberculosis are particularly important given the growing problem of [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis]].

The fully sequenced genome of ''M. tuberculosis'' has allowed scientists to clone many of these protein targets into expression vectors for purification and structure determination by X-ray crystallography.  Studies have identified a number of target proteins for structure determination, including extracellular proteins that may be involved in pathogenesis, iron-regulatory proteins, current drug targets, and proteins predicted to have novel folds. So far, structures have been determined for 708 of the proteins encoded by ''M. tuberculosis''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13952">{{About|the thermal design envelope of microprocessors|the general concept|power rating}}

The '''thermal design power''' ('''TDP'''), sometimes called '''thermal design point''', is the maximum amount of [[heat]] generated by a computer chip or component (often a [[CPU]], [[GPU]] or [[system on a chip]]) that the [[computer cooling|cooling system]] in a computer is designed to [[dissipation|dissipate]] under any workload.  

The TDP is typically not the largest amount of heat the CPU could ever generate ([[Power rating|peak power]]), such as by running a [[power virus]], but rather the maximum amount of heat that it would generate when running "real [[application software|applications]]". This ensures the computer will be able to handle essentially all applications without exceeding its thermal envelope, or requiring a cooling system for the maximum theoretical power (which would cost more but in favor of extra headroom for processing power).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | quote = In Intel's case, a specified chip's TDP has less to do with the amount of power a chip needs to use (or can use) and more to do with the amount of power the computer's fan and heatsink need to be able to dissipate while the chip is under sustained load. Actual power usage can be higher or (much) lower than TDP, but the figure is intended to give guidance to engineers designing cooling solutions for their products.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources state that the peak power for a microprocessor is usually 1.5 times the TDP rating.&lt;ref name="HennessyPatterson2012"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the TDP is a conventional figure while its measurement methodology has been the subject of controversy.  In particular, until around 2006 [[AMD]] used to report the maximum power draw of its processors as TDP, but [[Intel]] changed this practice with the introduction of its [[Conroe (microprocessor)|Conroe]] family of processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A similar but more recent controversy has involved the power TDP measurements of some [[Ivy Bridge (microarchitecture)|Ivy Bridge]] Y-series processors, with which Intel has introduced a new metric called ''scenario design power'' (SDP).&lt;ref name="anandtech-6655"&gt;{{Cite web

== Overview ==
{{See also|CPU power dissipation}}

The TDP of a CPU has been underestimated in some cases, leading to certain real applications (typically strenuous, such as video encoding or games) causing the CPU to exceed its specified TDP and resulting in overloading the computer's cooling system.  In this case, CPUs either cause a system failure (a "therm-trip") or throttle their speed down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://ixbtlabs.com/articles2/p4-throttling/
 | title = Testing Thermal Throttling in Pentium 4 CPUs with Northwood and Prescott cores
 | date = 2004-03-26 | accessdate = 2013-12-21
 | author = Stanislav Garmatyuk | website = ixbtlabs.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most modern processors will cause a therm-trip only upon a catastrophic cooling failure, such as a no longer operational fan or an incorrectly mounted heatsink.

For example, a [[laptop]]'s CPU cooling system may be designed for a 20&amp;nbsp;[[Watt|W]] TDP, which means that it can dissipate up to 20&amp;nbsp;watts of heat without exceeding the maximum [[junction temperature]] for the laptop's CPU.  A cooling system can do this using an active cooling method (e.g. forced convection) such as a [[Computer fan|fan]], or any of the three passive cooling methods: [[convection]], [[thermal radiation]] or [[Conduction (heat)|conduction]]. Typically, a combination of these methods is used.

Since safety margins and the definition of what constitutes a real application vary among [[Integrated device manufacturer|manufacturers]], TDP values between different manufacturers cannot be accurately compared.  For example, while a processor with a TDP of 100&amp;nbsp;W will almost certainly use more [[electric power|power]] at full load than a processor with a 10&amp;nbsp;W TDP from the same manufacturer, it may or may not use more power than a processor from a different manufacturer that has a 90&amp;nbsp;W TDP. Additionally, TDPs are often specified for families of processors, with the low-end models usually using significantly less power than those at the high end of the family.

The dynamic power consumed by a switching circuit is approximately proportional to the square of the voltage:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

where {{mvar|C}} is capacitance, {{mvar|f}} is frequency, and {{mvar|V}} is voltage.

== {{Anchor|VARIABLE}}Variable TDP ==
TDP specifications for some processors may allow them to work under multiple different power levels, depending on the usage scenario, available cooling capacities and desired power consumption.  Technologies that provide such variable TDPs include [[Intel]]'s ''configurable TDP'' (cTDP) and ''scenario design power'' (SDP), and [[AMD]]'s ''TDP power cap''.

=== {{Anchor|NDP|CTDP|TDPPC}}Configurable TDP ===
''Configurable TDP'' (''cTDP''), also known as ''programmable TDP'' or ''TDP power cap'', is an operating mode of later generations of Intel mobile processors ({{As of|2014|January|lc=yes}}) and AMD processors ({{As of|2012|June|lc=yes}}) that allows adjustments in their TDP values.  By modifying the processor behavior and its performance levels, power consumption of a processor can be changed altering its TDP at the same time.  That way, a processor can operate at higher or lower performance levels, depending on the available cooling capacities and desired power consumption.&lt;ref name="intel-mh-lines"&gt;{{cite web

 | quote = Configurable TDP (cTDP) and Low-Power Mode (LPM) form a design vector where the processor behavior and package TDP are  dynamically adjusted to a desired system performance and power envelope. [...] With cTDP, the processor is now capable of altering the maximum sustained power with an alternate guaranteed frequency. Configurable TDP allows operation in situations where extra cooling is available or situations where a cooler and quieter mode of operation is desired.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|69&amp;ndash;72}}&lt;ref name="phoronix-amd-kaveri"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intel processors that support cTDP provide three operating modes:&lt;ref name="intel-mh-lines" /&gt;{{rp|71&amp;ndash;72}}
* ''Nominal TDP''{{snd}} this is the processor's rated frequency and TDP.
* ''cTDP down''{{snd}} when a cooler or quieter mode of operation is desired, this mode specifies a lower TDP and lower guaranteed frequency versus the nominal mode.
* ''cTDP up''{{snd}} when extra cooling is available, this mode specifies a higher TDP and higher guaranteed frequency versus the nominal mode.

For example, some of the [[Haswell (microarchitecture)#MOBILE|mobile Haswell]] processors support cTDP up, cTDP down, or both modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

=== {{Anchor|SDP}}Scenario design power ===
Intel's description of ''Scenario Design Power (SDP)'': "SDP is an additional thermal reference point meant to represent thermally relevant device usage in real-world environmental scenarios. It balances performance and power requirements across system workloads to represent real-world power usage. "&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Scenario design power'' (''SDP'') is not an additional power state of a processor. The SDP only states the average power consumption of a processor using a certain mix of benchmark programs to simulate "real-world" scenarios".&lt;ref name="anandtech-6655" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | publisher = Ars Technica
 | quote = If the CPU needs to work hard for an extended period of time and the laptop gets warmer, it will slowly ramp down its speed until it's operating at its stated TDP. [...] There are two OEM-configurable "power level" states that define how quick the CPU can be in these situations: PL2 tells the processor how much power it's allowed to use when it needs a short burst of speed, and PL1 defines how quickly the processor can run under sustained load. [...] This is at the heart of what Intel is doing with the Y-series processors: their maximum TDP has been lowered four watts, from 17 to 13. Intel is also validating them for use at two lower PL1 values: 10 watts and 7&amp;nbsp;watts. This is where the marketing we discussed earlier comes in—rather than keeping these values under the covers as it has so far been content to do, Intel has taken that lowest value, put it on its product pages, and called it SDP.

==Renewable Heat Incentive==
In the UK, thermodynamic solar panels cannot be used to claim the [[Renewable Heat Incentive]]. This is due to the lack of technical standards for the testing and installation. The UK Microgeneration Certification Scheme is working to develop a testing standard, either based on MIS 3001 or MIS 3005 or a brand new scheme document if appropriate.

==Performance==

Lab testing has been carried out by Das Wärmepumpen-Testzentrum Buchs (WPZ) in Buchs Switzerland on an Energi Eco 200esm/i thermodynamic solar panel system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Thermodynamic Panels works|url=http://www.magicboxinternational.com/hot-water/aluminium-collector-thermodynamic-panel/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This showed a [[Coefficient of performance]] of 2.8 or 2.9 (depending on tank volume).

To push and support the sustainable development of United Nations, a partner of UNESCO HK, WISDP was established in October, 2017 to cooperate with UNESCO HK to push and facilitate the development, planning and implementation of 17 SDGs. WISDP is a worldwide study and [[research institute]] to drive the training and professional recognition of sustainable development to industries, business, education and public service.

WISDP was registered in Hong Kong with the company name, WORLD INSTITUTE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PLANNERS LIMITED and was incorporated on 12-OCT-2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hkcompa.com/ny|title=- Hong Kong Business Directory|author=|date=|website=Hong Kong Business Directory|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[company limited by guarantee]]. WISDP was formally launched in February 2018 and partner with training institutes to provide different levels of sustainable development training to industries and business. WISDP also establish memberships and certification processes to recognize the training, experiences and contributions of sustainable development for individuals and organizations.

==Learned Society of Sustainable Development==
United Nations established the training and initiatives of sustainable development to keep the sustainability of the earth as well as the human development. Sustainable development implies economic growth together with the protection of environmental quality and social situation, each reinforcing the other. It is crucial to harmonize three core elements: economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection. The earth is the home of human being and we need to protect make the sustainability of the earth through sustainable development culture and planning.

WISDP is a [[Learned Society]] fostering and advocating UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and the 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] in accordance with the three components &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thwink.org/sustain/glossary/ThreePillarsOfSustainability.htm|title=The Three Pillars of Sustainability|author=|date=|website=www.thwink.org|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Environment, Society and Economy. Training is provided for professionals according to their needs and successful trainees are awarded professional membership from WISDP and UNESCO HK Association, and subject to adequate relevant work experience, they are entitled to become Certified Sustainable Development Planners (CSDP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisdp.org.hk/cert_csdp.htm|title=WISDP - Menu|author=|date=|website=www.wisdp.org.hk|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opportunities are provided for awardees to apply for Fellowship status after a number of years of [[continuing professional development]] (CPD).

In 2018, WISDP Divisions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisdp.org.hk/division.htm|title=WISDP - Menu|author=|date=|website=www.wisdp.org.hk|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  launched training programmes and lead to professional memberships.
