[[Image:Whistlejacket by George Stubbs edit.jpg|thumb|240px|[[George Stubbs]] (1724-1806): ''[[Whistlejacket]]'' (c. 1762), [[National Gallery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/george-stubbs-whistlejacket |title=Whistlejacket: about 1762, George Stubbs |publisher=[[National Gallery]] |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

An '''animal painter''' is an artist who specialises in (or is known for their skill in) the portrayal of animals.

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]]'' dates the first express use of the term "animal painter" to the mid-18th century: by English [[physician]], [[Natural history|naturalist]] and writer [[John Berkenhout]] (1726-1791).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/animal-painting |title=Animal painting |publisher=''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the early 20th century, ''wildlife artist'' became a more usual term for contemporary animal painters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldlandtrust.org/gallery/exhibitions/wildlife-art-20th-century |title=Wildlife Art of the 20th Century |publisher=[[Woodland Trust]] |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Especially in the 17th century, animal painters would often collaborate with other artists, who would either paint the main subject in a [[history painting|historical]] or mythological piece, or the [[Landscape painting|landscape]] background in a decorative one. [[Frans Snyders]], a founder of the Baroque animal painting tradition, often provided the animals, and also still lifes of food, for [[Peter Paul Rubens]]; a different landscape specialist might provide the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frans-Snyders |title=Frans Snyders |publisher=''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' |accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Dutch Golden Age]] such specialists tended to produce smaller genre paintings concentrating on their specialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/gnrn/hd_gnrn.htm |title=Frans Snyders |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal painters came lower down in the [[hierarchy of genres]], but the best painters could make a very good living; many royal and aristocratic patrons were more interested in their subject matter than that of the more prestigious genres. Mainly in England, there were still more specialised painters from the 18th century who produced portraits of racehorses and prize specimens of livestock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/10429771/Why-the-George-Stubbs-paintings-were-worth-saving.html |title=Why the George Stubbs paintings were worth saving |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in France animal subjects continued to be decorative [[Capriccio (painting)|capriccios]] often set around garden statuary.

In 2014 ''[[The Guardian]]'' nominated ''[[The Goldfinch (painting)|The Goldfinch]]'' (1654) by [[Carel Fabritius]] (1622-1654) as the finest animal portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/jun/27/top-10-animal-portraits-in-art |title=The top 10 animal portraits in art |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animalier==
[[Animalier]], as a collective plural noun, is a term used in [[antiques]] for small-scale sculptures of animals in particular (animalier bronzes), but also paintings of animals. Large numbers of these were produced - often mass-produced - in the 19th century in France and elsewhere. Many earlier examples can be found, but [[animalier]] sculpture became more popular, and reputable, in early 19th century Paris, with the works of [[Antoine-Louis Barye]] (1795-1875) - for whom the term was coined, decisively, by critics in 1831&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O110845/walking-lion-statuette-barye-antoine-louis/ |title=Walking lion |publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] |accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; - and [[Christopher Fratin]] (1801-1864).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/collectables/30507/rise-of-the-animal-sculptures.html |title=Rise of the animal sculptures |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 19th-century, a taste for animal subjects was widespread among the middle-classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O171334/an-indian-panther-lying-down-statuette-barbedienne-ferdinand/ |title=An Indian panther lying down |publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] |accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildlife conservation==
Many modern wildlife artists or art groups hold benefits to support [[wildlife conservation]], or participate in contests held by wildlife conservation organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the AFC |url=http://www.natureartists.com/ |publisher=Artists for Conservation |accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement predominantly centered around Paris, France, and Italy, with some offshoots in England, Germany, and North America.

Some examples of animalier artists and their subjects are [[George Stubbs]] and [[Jules Moigniez]] (paintings and sculpture of horses), [[Antoine Barye|Antoine-Louis Barye]] (sculpture of bulls and humans), and [[Rembrandt Bugatti]] (felines, human figures, and zoo animals).

== History ==
[[File:Theseus Slaying Minotaur by Barye.jpg|thumb|left|''Theseus Slaying Minotaur'' by Barye]] Animals as a [[Motif (visual arts)|visual motif]] were used in [[ancient art]] and in [[tribal art]], in [[animal style]] art and objects but were not generally represented as figurative, anatomically correct, creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janson|first1=H.W.|title=History of art : a survey of the major visual arts from the dawn of history to the present day|date=1986|publisher=H.N.

The term animalier was first used by the French press and [[Salon (Paris)|salon]] jurors, often as a derogatory term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gallery|first1=The Bronze|title=Les Animaliers - The 19th century French movement of Bronze Sculpture|url=http://bronze-gallery.com/info/info.cfm?infoID=9|website=bronze-gallery.com|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris salon thought animal subjects too common for fine art, but with the opening of the new [[Jardin des Plantes|Paris Jardin des Plantes]] zoo and the [[Ménagerie du Jardin des plantes]], interest in animal art increased.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iub.edu/~iuam/online_modules/metz/collection.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Dukes of [[Duke of Orléans|Orleans]], [[Duke of Luynes|Luynes]], [[Duke of Montpensier|Montpensier]], and [[Duke of Nemours|Nemours]] were soon to become Barye's patrons. In 1882 [[Edouard Manet]] created a portrait in pastel on canvas of the animalier artist Julien de La Rochenoire, which has been owned by the [[Getty Museum]] since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/265936/edouard-manet-portrait-of-julien-de-la-rochenoire-french-1882/&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:George Stubbs - Zebra - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|George Stubbs - Zebra - Google Art Project]] The art of George Stubbs became a favorite of collector [[Paul Mellon]], who donated many of Stubbs' paintings to the [[Yale Center for British Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maj|first1=Yale Center for British Art, Lec|title=Zebra|url=http://collections.britishart.yale.edu/vufind/Record/1669240|website=collections.britishart.yale.edu|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that "many animal sculptures were modeled in plaster for exhibition and cast later in bronze editions. The size and variety of an edition depended on the popularity of the piece at exhibition, and many Barye, Mêne, and Fratin pieces were so popular that they were cast in very large editions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Metz Collection|url=http://www.iub.edu/~iuam/online_modules/metz/collection.html|website=www.iub.edu|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animalier artists ==
[[File:Rembrandt bugatti zoo antwerpen 1910.jpg|thumb|left|Rembrandt Bugatti at the zoo in Antwerp, Belgium]]Artists of the animalier movement were referred to as ''[[les animaliers]]''. Important artists of the animalier movement included [[Antoine-Louis Barye]] (1796–1875), [[Rembrandt Bugatti]] (1884–1916), [[George Stubbs]] (1724–1806), [[Alfred Dedreux]] (1810–1860), [[Christopher Fratin]] (1801–1864),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bronze-gallery.com/sculptors/artist.cfm?sculptorID=21

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rosa Bonheur]] (1822–1899), [[Isidore Bonheur]] (1827–1901), [[Anna Hyatt Huntington]] (1876–1973), [[Paul-Edouard Delabrierre]] (1829–1912), [[Alfred Dubucand]] (1828–1894), [[Jules Moigniez]] (1835–1894) and [[Émile-Coriolan Guillemin]] (1841–1907).

== Animalier reproductions ==
Many beautiful [[replicas]] are made of animalier sculpture, which may be cast or molded in any size and of any material. The most desirable of these are exact in detail and made from the same material, such as [[cast iron]], [[spelter]], or [[cast bronze]], as used in the artist's original sculpture. Most of the original animalier sculptors used the traditional [[lost wax]] process of casting prevalent at the time. Alexandre Guionnet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auguste Cain.  Expert art authentication, certificates of authenticity and expert art appraisals - Art Experts|url=https://www.artexpertswebsite.com/pages/artists/cain.php|website=www.artexpertswebsite.com|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was exceptional in that he worked in wood. Modern reproductions of the original sculptures frequently use [[patinated]] [[verdigris]] cast bronze or iron, or [[Resin casting|bonded marble resin]] (pulverized reconstituted marble combined with resin glue), as well as various other materials and techniques, such as a composite of [[Capiz]] [[placuna placenta]] oyster shells, also known as window oyster shells, which come primarily from the [[Philippines]] (where they are known as ''kapiz'').{{clear}}

The '''Archive of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama''' ('''APGRD''') is a research project based at the [[University of Oxford]], [[England]], founded in 1996 by [[Edith Hall]] and [[Oliver Taplin]].&lt;ref name="APGRD"&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.apgrd.ox.ac.uk/about-us/history | title = APGRD website - About us  - History }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current Director is [[Fiona Macintosh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apgrd.ox.ac.uk/about-us/people|title=People {{!}} APGRD|website=www.apgrd.ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The APGRD's focus is the study of performances of ancient drama and epic worldwide, ranging from the original performances in antiquity to the present day.&lt;ref name="APGRD"/&gt; It also runs a number of programmes promoting new writing and performance, including the 2005–2011 '''Onassis Programme''', which commissioned, developed and produced professional work from artists from around the world, including [[Seamus Heaney]] and [[Derek Walcott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.onassis.ox.ac.uk/Onassis%20Past%20Events.html | title = The Onassis Programme, Past Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The APGRD was praised by Oxford University for its engagement with authors, directors and other theatre practitioners, and was selected as one of the university's ''Impacts'' showcase projects for helping to "sustain the distinctive and dynamic nature of the UK theatre".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/research/research_impact/oxford_impacts/theatre.html | title= Oxford Impacts: Influencing Contemporary Theatre Practice | publisher= [[Oxford University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project’s publications have been described as playing "a pivotal role in establishing the parameters and methodologies of the study of the reception of Classical drama in performance".&lt;ref&gt;Hallie Rebecca Marshall, ''[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2006/2006-09-11.html Bryn Mawr Classical Review]'', 11 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8810">[[File:CarnyxDeTintignac2.jpg|thumb|Carnyx from the recently discovered [[Tintignac]] group]]
[[Image:Gundestrup E.jpg|thumb|440px|Three carnyx players are depicted at right on plate E of the [[Gundestrup cauldron]].]]

The '''carnyx''' was a [[wind instrument]] of the [[Iron Age]] [[Celt]]s, used between c. 200 BC and c. AD 200. It was a type of [[bronze]] [[trumpet]] with an elongated S shape, held so that the long straight central portion was vertical and the short mouthpiece end section and the much wider bell were horizontal in opposed directions. The bell was styled in the shape of an open-mouthed [[boar]]'s, or other animal's, head. 

It was used in warfare, probably to incite troops to battle and intimidate opponents, as [[Polybius]] recounts. The instrument's significant height allowed it to be heard over the heads of the participants in battles or ceremonies.

==Etymology==
The word “carnyx” is derived from the [[Gaulish]] root, "carn-" or "cern-" meaning "antler" or "horn," and the same root of the name of the god, [[Cernunnos]].&lt;ref&gt;Delmarre, 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;106–107&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical record==
[[File:CarnyxDeTintignac3.jpg|thumb|left|The serpent head from [[Tintignac]]]]



===Archaeology===
Until 2004, fragments of only five carnyces had been preserved, from modern Scotland, France, Germany, Romania and Switzerland, but in 2004 archaeologists discovered a first-century-BC deposit at [[Tintignac]] in [[Corrèze]], France.

In September 2004, over 500 fragments of iron and bronze objects were discovered in a Gallic pit. The objects included a dozen swords and scabbards, iron spearheads, a shield, ten bronze helmets and an iron bird, 2 animal heads, one animal body, a cauldron, and seven Carnyces, one of which is almost complete. These unique military and religious objects are currently being studied by Christophe Maniquet’s team, and are in the process of conservation and restoration by the ''Materia Viva'' laboratory in Toulouse.

Four of the carnyces had boar's heads, the fifth appears to be a serpent-like monster; they appear to represent a ritual deposit dating to soon after the [[Roman conquest of Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/fr/news/local_news/france-trumpets-discovery-of-gallic-war-trophies-14434.html Press report]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tintignac finds enabled some fragments found in northern Italy decades before to be identified in 2012 as coming from a carnyx.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2012/11/15/Ancient-Celtic-war-horn-found-in-Italy/UPI-43251353006605/ UPI.com] Carnyx identified in Italy&lt;/ref&gt;

The only example from the British Isles is the Deskford Carnyx, found at the farm of Leitchestown, [[Deskford]], [[Banffshire]], Scotland in 1816. Only the boar's head bell survives, also apparently placed as a ritual deposit.  It was donated to Banff Museum, and is now on loan from Aberdeenshire Museums Service to the [[Museum of Scotland]]. The location and age of the Deskford Carnyx suggests the instrument had a peaceful, ceremonial use and was not only used in warfare. 

Before 2004 this was the best surviving example, and generally copied in earlier reconstructions.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter&lt;/ref&gt; The Deskford find was made almost entirely of brass, a metal used almost exclusively by the Romans, and strictly controlled by them. Further, the basic size and shape of the Deskford find suggests it may in fact have been a Roman military draco standard.

===Depiction in sculpture===
The instrument is known from depictions on coins and [[relief]]s, notably from [[Trajan's Column]] and the so-called initiation scene of the [[Gundestrup cauldron]].

===Literature===
The name is known from textual sources, carnyces are reported from the Celtic attack on the [[Delphi]] in 279 BC, as well as from [[Julius Caesar]]'s campaign in [[Gaul]] and [[Claudius]]' invasion of [[British Iron Age|Britain]]. [[Diodorus Siculus]] around 60-30 BC said (Histories, 5.30):
:''"Their trumpets again are of a peculiar barbarian kind; they blow into them and produce a harsh sound which suits the tumult of war''"
&lt;!-- Polybius describes the terror of the Romans at the onslaught of the Celts at the battle of Telamon. needs cite and actual quote --&gt;

===Objects from Tintignac===
Objects found at [[Tintignac]] were exhibited at the 2012 exhibition "Les Gaulois, une expo renversante" (''The Gauls, a stunning exhibition'').

|pos=right}}
The reconstruction of the Deskford Carnyx was initiated by Dr. [[John Purser]], and commenced in 1991 funded jointly by the Glenfiddich Living Scotland award and the National Museums of Scotland.  In addition to John Purser as musicologist, the team comprised the archaeologist Fraser Hunter, silversmith John Creed, and trombonist [[John Kenny (trombonist)|John Kenny]].  After 2,000 years of silence the reconstructed Deskford Carnyx was unveiled at the National Museum of Scotland in April 1993.

In 1993 Kenny became the first person to play the carnyx in 2,000 years, and has since lectured and performed on the instrument internationally, in the concert hall, on radio, television, and film. There are numerous compositions for the carnyx and it is featured on seven CDs. On March 15, 2003 he performed solo to an audience of 65,000 in the [[Stade De France]] in Paris.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

On 15 June 2017 "The Music of the Forest", a specially commissioned work by Lakeland composer, Christopher Gibbs, featuring a reconstructed carnyx, received its world premiere at [[Slaidburn]] Village Hall. The four-part song cycle evoked the landscape and history of the [[Forest of Bowland]] and was performed by the Renaissance Singers of [[Blackburn Cathedral]] under the direction of Samuel Hudson. The carnyx was played by John Kenny.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lancashire.gov.uk/news/details.aspx?Id=PR17/0137]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Church of Ecce Homo''' was a [[catholic Church]] in [[Alcamo]], in the [[province of Trapani]].

== Historical hints ==
The present Church was built in 1753 on the same spot where there was a [[chapel]], called the ''Crocifissello'' (that is the small [[Crucifix]]) close to the western town walls; in fact, as it was very little, the members of the Congregation asked the [[municipality]] of that time, the [[authorization]] to have the chapel’s [[courtyard]] in order to build a wider Church there.&lt;ref name="jaco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacoponedatodi.xoom.it/ecce%20homo.htm|website=jacoponedatodi.xoom.it|title=ECCE HOMO|accessdate=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction started in 1753 and was completed the following year; the building was closed to service because of the [[1968 Belice earthquake]]. After a lot of years, in 1986, the Monuments and Fine Arts Department of Trapani decided a first restoration work including the consolidation of the Church, the [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] and the roof.

Later, in 1992 the Department disposed the completing  of the works, and they repaired the [[stucco]]es, replaced the frames, adapted the systems, made the gildings and painted the Church.&lt;ref name="jaco"/&gt;

Today the Church of the Most Holy Ecce Homo is no longer a temple left to itself, on the contrary, it is a monument rescued from decay, and it has recently been used as an [[auditorium]] and as a meeting place for cultural events.&lt;ref name="trapaniplus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trapaniplus.it/schedacosedavedere.php?cosadavedere=158|website=trapaniplus.it|title=www.trapaniplus.it/schedacosedavedere.php?cosadavedere=158|accessdate=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description and works ==
The church has a simple portal, surmounted by a niche where you can see a marble [[alto-rilievo]] panel representing  [[Ecce homo|Ecce Homo]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico-artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo-Calatafimi-Castellammare Golfo p.62, Alcamo, Sarograf, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one circular nave, similar to that one in the [[Saints Cosma and Damiano's Church (Alcamo)|Saints Cosma and Damiano's Church]], with beautiful [[Settecento]] stucco decorations on the vault;  it has an emispheric shape, with four webs surmounting the windows ending on [[masonry]] pillars.

Inside the webs there are represented the profecy of the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]], the [[Flagellation]], the [[Calvary]] and the Risen’s [[Cross]]; in the middle of the vault there are the [[Holy Ghost]], as a dove, and the [[Bible]].&lt;ref name="jaco"/&gt;

There are three altars and these works:
*Ecce Homo, a [[wooden]] statue on the high altar
*A wooden Crucifix, on the left  altar
*[[Saint Francis of Paola]]: a recent statue on the right altar
*Organ with its [[choir]], settled above the entrance opposite the high altar.

== The Congregation ==
The Congregation of  the Most Holy Ecce Homo, founded at about 1750 by canonico Don Vincenzo Fiderico, [[Chapelain]] of the Hospital Santo Spirito e San Vito and its first [[Rector (religion)|Rector]], was formed by butchers and other merchants, who, owing to their working hours, were used to meet on Friday night in this Church for their spiritual meetings.

After having been hosted in other churches, in 1753 the [[bishop of Mazara del Vallo]], after some pressing requests made by Congregation, gave them the Church of the Crocifissello, in the district of Chiesa Madre and adjoining a courtyard limited by the old town walls and some houses.

The main scopes were these:
* To promote the greater glory of God the Father and of the Holy Church, the sinners’ conversion and the end of blasfemies.
* To devote oneself to spiriritual works and to the Most Holy Ecce Homo
* To take action for the reform of one’s habits, by giving other people the good example of [[Christian]] life and maintaining the spirit of charity towards everybody, because this is the bond which connects us to God.&lt;ref name="cat"&gt;Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.89-90, Alcamo, Campo, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

These people were excluded:
*All women
*Noblemen or teachers or dignitaries of any kind
*Immoral, irreligious and  ed heretical people
*The people condemned for public or private crimes or guity of illegal purchase of Church property
*Dissolute or scandalous people, such as concubinaries, [[adulterers]], blasfemers, violators of festivities.

The feast was celebrated on the first Friday of March and it was preceded by a week of spiritual exercises and followed by the ''Forty Hours Devotion''. During the rites and processions, the members of the congregation  wore a cloth [[scapular]] with  two violet [[ribbons]] at their ends: one side, with the image of Ecce Homo, was hanging on their chest, and the other, behind their shoulders, had the [[embroidery]] of a crown made by thorns and three nails inside it.

The Congregation existed  until 1968, when the [[Belice Earthquake|Belice earthquake]] damaged its  structure remarkably and the Church was unfit for use..

'''Color Field painting''' is a style of abstract painting that emerged in New York City during the 1940s and 1950s. It was inspired by European [[modernism]] and closely related to [[Abstract Expressionism]], while many of its notable early proponents were among the pioneering Abstract Expressionists. Color Field is characterized primarily by large fields of flat, solid [[color]] spread across or stained into the canvas creating areas of unbroken surface and a flat picture plane. The movement places less emphasis on gesture, brushstrokes and action in favour of an overall consistency of form and process. In color field painting "color is freed from objective context and becomes the subject in itself."&lt;ref name="nga"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm |title=Themes in American Art: Abstraction.|work=National Gallery of Art|accessdate=June 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608093226/http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm |archivedate=June 8, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1950s and 1960s, Color field painters emerged in Great Britain, Canada, Washington, D.C. and the West Coast of the United States using formats of stripes, targets, simple geometric patterns and references to landscape imagery and to nature.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/c/colour-field-painting Colour Field Painting]".

== Historical roots ==

[[File:No 61 Mark Rothko.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mark Rothko]], ''[[No. 61 (Rust and Blue)]]'', 1953, 115 cm × 92 cm (45 in × 36 in). [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]]]]

The focus of attention in the world of contemporary art began to shift from [[Paris]] to New York after [[World War II]] and the development of American [[Abstract Expressionism]]. During the late 1940s and early 1950s [[Clement Greenberg]] was the first art critic to suggest and identify a dichotomy between differing tendencies within the Abstract Expressionist canon. Taking issue with [[Harold Rosenberg]] (another important champion of Abstract Expressionism), who wrote of the virtues of [[action painting]] in his article "American Action Painters" published in the December 1952 issue of ''[[ARTnews]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/brush/rosen.htm Harold Rosenberg] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114181439/http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/brush/rosen.htm |date=2012-01-14 }}. National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution. Retrieved 22 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg observed another tendency toward all-over color or Color Field in the works of several of the so-called 'first generation' Abstract Expressionists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2008/03/06/arts/0307-COLO_index.html Color As Field: American Painting]. ''The New York Times''. Retrieved December 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Rothko]] was one of the painters that Greenberg referred to as a Color Field painter exemplified by ''Magenta, Black, Green on Orange'', although Rothko himself refused to adhere to any label. For Rothko, color was "merely an instrument." In a sense, his best known works – the "multiforms" and his other signature paintings – are, in essence, the same expression, albeit one of purer (or less concrete or definable, depending on your interpretation) means, which is that of the same "basic human emotions," as his earlier surrealistic mythological paintings. What is common among these stylistic innovations is a concern for "tragedy, ecstasy and doom". By 1958, whatever spiritual expression Rothko meant to portray on canvas, it was growing increasingly darker. His bright reds, yellows and oranges of the early 1950s subtly transformed into dark blues, greens, grays and blacks. His final series of paintings from the mid-1960s were gray, and black with white borders, seemingly abstract landscapes of an endless bleak, tundra-like, unknown country.

Rothko, during the mid-1940s, was in the middle of a crucial period of transition, and he had been impressed by [[Clyfford Still]]'s abstract fields of color, which were influenced in part by the landscapes of Still's native North Dakota. In 1947, during a subsequent semester teaching at the California School of Fine Art (known today as the [[San Francisco Art Institute]]), Rothko and Still flirted with the idea of founding their own curriculum or school. Still was considered one of the foremost Color Field painters – his non-figurative paintings are largely concerned with the juxtaposition of different colors and surfaces. His jagged flashes of color give the impression that one layer of color has been "torn" off the painting, revealing the colors underneath, reminiscent of [[stalactite]]s and primordial caverns. Still's arrangements are irregular, jagged, and pitted with heavy texture and sharp surface contrast as seen above in ''1957D1''.

Another artist whose best known works relate to both abstract expressionism and to color field painting is [[Robert Motherwell]]. Motherwell's style of abstract expressionism, characterized by loose opened fields of painterly surfaces accompanied by loosely drawn and measured lines and shapes, was influenced by both [[Joan Miró]] and by [[Henri Matisse]].&lt;ref&gt;De Antonio, Emile. ''Painters Painting, a Candid History of The Modern Art Scene 1940–1970''. Abbeville Press, 1984. 44, 61-63, 65, 68-69. {{ISBN|0-89659-418-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Motherwell]]'s ''Elegy to the Spanish Republic No. 110'' (1971) is the work of a pioneer of both [[Abstract Expressionism]] and Color Field painting. Robert Motherwell's ''Elegy to The Spanish Republic'' series embodies both tendencies, while Motherwell's ''Open Series'' of the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s places him firmly within the Color Field camp.&lt;ref name="Tate2"&gt;"[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/motherwell-open-no-121-bolton-landing-elegy-t01194 Open Series #121]". [[Tate]]. Retrieved December 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 Motherwell said, "Throughout my life, the 20th-century painter whom I've admired the most has been Matisse",&lt;ref&gt;De Antonio, Emile. ''Painters Painting, a Candid History of The Modern Art Scene 1940–1970, p. 44, Abbeville Press 1984, {{ISBN|0-89659-418-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; alluding to several of his own series of paintings that reflect Matisse's influence, most notably his ''Open Series'' that come closest to classic Color Field painting.

[[Barnett Newman]] is considered one of the major figures in abstract expressionism and one of the foremost of the color field painters. Newman's mature work is characterized by areas of color pure and flat separated by thin vertical lines, or "zips" as Newman called them, exemplified by ''[[Vir Heroicus Sublimis]]'' in the collection of [[MoMA]]. Newman himself thought that he reached his fully mature style with the ''Onement'' series (from 1948) seen here.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barnett Newman]]&lt;/ref&gt; The zips define the spatial structure of the painting while simultaneously dividing and uniting the composition. Although Newman's paintings appear to be purely abstract, and many of them were originally untitled, the names he later gave them hinted at specific subjects being addressed, often with a Jewish theme. Two paintings from the early 1950s, for example, are called ''Adam'' and ''Eve'' (see [[Adam and Eve]]), and there are also ''[[Uriel]]'' (1954) and ''[[Abraham]]'' (1949), a very dark painting, which, in addition to being the name of a biblical patriarch, was also the name of Newman's father, who had died in 1947. Newman's late works, such as the ''[[Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue]]'' series, use vibrant, pure colors, often on very large canvases.

[[Jackson Pollock]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Clyfford Still]], Mark Rothko, [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Ad Reinhardt]] and [[Arshile Gorky]] (in his last works) were among the prominent abstract expressionist painters that Greenberg identified as being connected to Color Field painting in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huliq.com/50865/smithsonian-museum-exhibits-color-field-painting "Smithsonian Museum Exhibits Color Field Painting", retrieved December 7, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Pollock is closely associated with [[action painting]] because of his style, technique, and his painterly 'touch' and his physical application of paint, art critics have likened Pollock to both action painting and color field painting. Another critical view advanced by Clement Greenberg connects Pollock's allover canvases to the large-scale ''[[Water Lilies]]'' of [[Claude Monet]] done during the 1920s. Greenberg, art critic [[Michael Fried]], and others have observed that the overall feeling in Pollock's most famous works – his ''drip'' paintings – read as vast fields of built-up linear elements often reading as vast complexes of similar valued paint skeins that read as all over fields of color and drawing, and are related to the mural-sized late Monets that are constructed of many passages of close valued brushed and scumbled marks that also read as close valued fields of color and drawing that Monet used in building his picture surfaces. Pollock's use of all-over composition lend a philosophical and a physical connection to the way the color field painters like Newman, Rothko and Still construct their unbroken and in Still's case broken surfaces. In several paintings that Pollock painted after his classic ''drip'' painting period of 1947–1950, he used the technique of staining fluid oil paint and house paint into raw canvas. During 1951 he produced a series of semi-figurative black stain paintings, and in 1952 he produced stain paintings using color. In his November 1952 exhibition at the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery in New York City Pollock showed ''Number 12, 1952'', a large, masterful stain painting that resembles a brightly colored stained landscape (with an overlay of broadly dripped dark paint); the painting was acquired from the exhibition by [[Nelson Rockefeller]] for his personal collection. In 1960 the painting was severely damaged by fire in the Governors Mansion in Albany that also severely damaged an Arshile Gorky painting and several other works in the Rockefeller collection. However, by 1999 it had been restored and was installed in Albany Mall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B-QCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=1961+Fire+damages+art+collection+of++Governor+Rockefellers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Puraoeksco&amp;sig=kXNGISm1LkNM53NlzW4ZePgUlAY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=efvDTfSeMYHt0gGvjtn2Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false August 16, 1976 NY Magazine, p.66] Retrieved May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ogs.ny.gov/esp/CT/History.asp Pollock #12 1952 at NY State Mall project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313223525/http://ogs.ny.gov/esp/CT/History.asp |date=2014-03-13 }} Retrieved May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;



While Arshile Gorky is considered to be one of the founding fathers of Abstract Expressionism and a [[Surrealist]], he was also one of the first painters of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] who used the technique of 'staining'. Gorky created broad fields of vivid, open, unbroken color that he used in his many of his paintings as ''grounds.'' In Gorky's most effective and accomplished paintings between the years 1941 and 1948, he consistently used intense stained fields of color, often letting the paint run and drip, under and around his familiar lexicon of organic and biomorphic shapes and delicate lines. Another abstract expressionist whose works in the 1940s call to mind the stain paintings of the 1960s and the 1970s is [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]]. Brooks frequently used stain as a technique in his paintings from the late 1940s. Brooks began diluting his [[oil paint]] in order to have fluid colors with which to pour and drip and stain into the mostly raw canvas that he used. These works often combined [[calligraphy]] and abstract shapes. During the final three decades of his career, [[Sam Francis]]' style of large-scale bright Abstract expressionism was closely associated with Color Field painting. His paintings straddled both camps within the Abstract Expressionist rubric, action painting and Color Field painting.

Having seen [[Jackson Pollock]]'s 1951 paintings of thinned black oil paint stained into raw canvas, [[Helen Frankenthaler]] began to produce ''stain paintings'' in varied oil colors on raw canvas in 1952. Her most famous painting from that period is ''Mountains and Sea''(as seen below). She is one of the originators of the Color Field movement that emerged in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87871332 "'Color Field' Artists Found a Different Way"] Retrieved 3 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Frankenthaler also studied with Hans Hofmann. Hofmann's paintings are a symphony of color as seen in ''The Gate'', 1959–1960. Hofmann was renowned not only as an artist but also as a teacher of art, both in his native Germany and later in the U.S. Hofmann, who came to the United States from Germany in the early 1930s, brought with him the legacy of [[Modernism]]. Hofmann was a young artist working in Paris who painted there before [[World War I]]. Hofmann worked in Paris with [[Robert Delaunay]], and he knew firsthand the innovative work of both [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. Matisse's work had an enormous influence on him, and on his understanding of the expressive language of color and the potentiality of abstraction. Hofmann was one of the first theorists of color field painting, and his theories were influential to artists and to critics, particularly to Clement Greenberg, as well as to others during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1953 [[Morris Louis]] and [[Kenneth Noland]] were both profoundly influenced by Frankenthaler's stain paintings after visiting her studio in [[New York City]]. Returning to [[Washington, DC.]], they began to produce the major works that created the color field movement in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="Fenton1"&gt;Fenton, Terry. "[http://www.sharecom.ca/fenton/louis.html Morris Louis]". sharecom.ca. Retrieved December 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 then [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] [[curator]] [[Henry Geldzahler]] said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]] included the work of both [[Morris Louis]] and [[Kenneth Noland]] in a show that he did at the Kootz Gallery in the early 1950s. Clem was the first to see their potential. He invited them up to New York in 1953, I think it was, to Helen's studio to see a painting that she had just done called Mountains and Sea, a very, very beautiful painting, which was in a sense, out of Pollock and out of Gorky. It also was one of the first stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which the stain technique was used, perhaps the first one. Louis and Noland saw the picture unrolled on the floor of her studio and went back to Washington, DC., and worked together for a while, working at the implications of this kind of painting.&lt;ref&gt;De Antonio, Emile.

[[Morris Louis]]'s painting ''Where'' 1960, was a major innovation that moved abstract expressionist painting forward in a new direction toward Color Field and [[Minimalism]]. Among Louis's major works are his various series of color field paintings. Some of his best known series are the ''Unfurleds'', the ''Veils'', the ''Florals'' and the ''Stripes'' or ''Pillars''. From 1929 to 1933, Louis studied at the Maryland Institute of Fine and Applied Arts (now [[Maryland Institute College of Art]]). He worked at various odd jobs to support himself while painting and in 1935 was president of the Baltimore Artists' Association. From 1936 to 1940, he lived in New York and worked in the easel division of the [[Works Progress Administration]] Federal Art Project. During this period, he knew Arshile Gorky, [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], and [[Jack Tworkov]], returning to Baltimore in 1940. In 1948, he started to use [[Magna paint|Magna]] – oil-based [[acrylic paint]]s. In 1952, Louis moved to Washington, D.C., living there somewhat apart from the [[New York City|New York]] scene and working almost in isolation. He and a group of artists that included [[Kenneth Noland]] were central to the development of Color Field painting. The basic point about Louis's work and that of other Color Field painters, sometimes known as the [[Washington Color School]] in contrast to most of the other new approaches of the late 1950s and early 1960s, is that they greatly simplified the idea of what constitutes the look of a finished painting.

Kenneth Noland, working in Washington, DC., was also a pioneer of the color field movement in the late 1950s who used series as important formats for his paintings. Some of Noland's major series were called ''Targets'', ''Chevrons'' and ''Stripes''. Noland attended the experimental [[Black Mountain College]] and studied art in his home state of North Carolina. Noland studied with professor [[Ilya Bolotowsky]] who introduced him to [[neo-plasticism]] and the work of [[Piet Mondrian]]. There he also studied [[Bauhaus]] theory and color with [[Josef Albers]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844770,00.html?promoid=googlep Bold Emblems]".

In 1970 art critic Clement Greenberg said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'd place Pollock along with Hofmann and Morris Louis in this country among the very greatest painters of this generation. I actually don't think there was anyone in the same generation in Europe quite to match them. Pollock didn't like Hofmann's paintings. He couldn't make them out. He didn't take the trouble to. And Hofmann didn't like Pollock's allover paintings, nor could most of Pollock's artist friends make head or tail out of them, the things he did from 1947 to '50. But Pollock's paintings live or die in the same context as [[Rembrandt]]'s or [[Titian]]'s or [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]]'s or [[Francisco Goya|Goya's]] or [[Jacques-Louis David|David's]] or ...or [[Manet]]'s or [[Peter Paul Rubens|Ruben's]] or [[Michelangelo]]'s paintings. There's no interruption, there's no mutation here. Pollock asked to be tested by the same eye that could see how good [[Raphael]] was when he was good or [[Piero della Francesca|Piero]] when he was good.&lt;ref&gt;De Antonio, Emile.

== Color Field movement ==

By the late 1950s and early 1960s young artists began to break away stylistically from abstract expressionism; experimenting with new ways of making pictures; and new ways of handling paint and color. In the early 1960s several and various new movements in abstract painting were closely related to each other, and superficially were categorized together; although they turned out to be profoundly different in the long run. Some of the new styles and movements that appeared in the early 1960s as responses to abstract expressionism were called: ''[[Washington Color School]]'', ''[[Hard-edge painting]]'', ''[[Geometric abstraction]]'', ''[[Minimalism]]'', and ''Color Field''.



[[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]] also was a painter known especially for paintings of vertical stripes of color, like ''Black Grey Beat,'' 1964, and he also was a member of the group of abstract painters in [[Washington DC]] during the 1960s known as the [[Washington Color School]]. The Washington painters were among the most prominent of the mid-century Color Field painters.

The artists associated with the Color Field movement during the 1960s were moving away from gesture and [[angst]] in favor of clear surfaces and [[wikt:gestalt|gestalt]]. During the early to mid-1960s ''Color Field painting'' was the term for the work of artists like [[Anne Truitt]], [[John McLaughlin (artist)|John McLaughlin]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Thomas Downing]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Paul Feeley]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], [[Jack Bush]], [[Howard Mehring]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Mary Pinchot Meyer]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Robert Goodnough]], [[Ray Parker (painter)|Ray Parker]], [[Al Held]], [[Emerson Woelffer]], [[David Simpson (artist)|David Simpson]], and others whose works were formerly related to second generation abstract expressionism; and also to younger artists like [[Larry Poons]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Larry Zox]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]] and [[Frank Stella]]. All were moving in a new direction away from the violence and anxiety of [[Action painting]] toward a new and seemingly calmer ''language'' of color.

Although ''Color Field'' is associated with Clement Greenberg, Greenberg actually preferred to use the term ''Post-Painterly Abstraction.'' In 1964, Clement Greenberg curated an influential exhibition that traveled the country called [[Post-painterly abstraction]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/ppaessay.html Clement Greenberg]". ''Post-Painterly Abstraction''. Retrieved December 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition expanded the definition of color field painting. Color Field painting clearly pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from abstract expressionism. In 2007 curator [[Karen Wilkin]] curated an exhibition called ''Color As Field:American Painting 1950-1975'' that traveled to several museums throughout the United States. The exhibition showcased several artists representing two generations of Color Field painters.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Roberta.

In 1970 painter [[Jules Olitski]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't know what Color Field painting means. I think it was probably invented by some critic, which is okay, but I don't think the phrase means anything. Color Field painting? I mean, what is color? Painting has to do with a lot of things. Color is among the things it has to do with. It has to do with surface. It has to do with shape, It has to do with feelings which are more difficult to get at.&lt;ref&gt;De Antonio, Emile.

[[Jack Bush]] was a Canadian [[abstract expressionist]] painter, born in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]] in 1909. He was a member of [[Painters Eleven]], the group founded by [[William Ronald]] in 1954 to promote abstract painting in Canada, and was soon encouraged in his art by the American art critic [[Clement Greenberg]]. With encouragement from Greenberg, Bush became closely tied to two movements that grew out of the efforts of the [[abstract expressionist]]s: Color Field Painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. His painting ''Big A'' is an example of his color field paintings of the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="jbush" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fenton2"&gt;Fenton, Terry.

During the late 1950s and early 1960s [[Frank Stella]] was a significant figure in the emergence of [[Minimalism]], [[Post-Painterly Abstraction]] and Color Field painting. His [[shaped canvas]]es of the 1960s like ''Harran II,'' 1967, revolutionized abstract painting. One of the most important characteristics of Stella's paintings is his use of repetition. His ''Black Pin Stripe paintings'' of 1959 startled and shocked an art world that was unused to seeing monochromatic and repetitive images, painted flat, with almost no inflexion. During the early 1960s Stella made several series' of notched ''Aluminum Paintings'' and shaped ''Copper Paintings'' before making multi-colored and asymmetrical shaped canvases of the late 1960s. Frank Stella's approach and relationship to Color Field painting was not permanent or central to his creative output; as his work became more and more three-dimensional after 1980.

In the late 1960s [[Richard Diebenkorn]] began his ''Ocean Park series''; created during the final 25 years of his career and they are important examples of color field painting. The ''Ocean Park series'' exemplified by ''Ocean Park No.129,'' connects his earlier [[abstract expressionist]] works with Color field painting. During the early 1950s, Richard Diebenkorn was known as an abstract expressionist, and his gestural abstractions were close to the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] in sensibility but firmly based in the [[San Francisco]] abstract expressionist sensibility; a place where [[Clyfford Still]] has a considerable influence on younger artists by virtue of his teaching at the [[San Francisco Art Institute]].

By the mid-1950s, Richard Diebenkorn along with [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]] and several others formed the [[Bay Area Figurative School]] with a return to Figurative painting. During the period between the fall 1964 and the spring of 1965 Diebenkorn traveled throughout Europe, he was granted a cultural visa to visit and view Henri Matisse paintings in important Soviet museums. He traveled to the then Soviet Union to study [[Henri Matisse]] paintings in Russian museums that were rarely seen outside of Russia. When he returned to painting in the Bay Area in mid-1965 his resulting works summed up all that he had learned from his more than a decade as a leading figurative painter.&lt;ref name="Jane56"&gt;Livingston, Jane.

== Overview ==

Color Field painting is related to [[Post-painterly abstraction]], [[Suprematism]], [[Abstract Expressionism]], [[Hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. It initially referred to a particular type of [[abstract expressionism]], especially the work of [[Mark Rothko]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and several series of paintings by [[Joan Miró]]. [[Art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]] perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from [[Action painting]].

An important distinction that made color field painting different from abstract expression was the paint handling. The most basic fundamental defining technique of painting is application of paint and the color field painters revolutionized the way paint could be effectively applied.

Color Field painting sought to rid art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Barnett Newman]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Frank Stella]], and others often used greatly reduced formats, with drawing essentially simplified to repetitive and regulated systems, basic references to nature, and a highly articulated and [[Color psychology|psychological use of color]]. In general these artists eliminated overt recognizable imagery in favor of abstraction. Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], these artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image often within series' of related types.

In distinction to the emotional energy and gestural surface marks and paint handling of Abstract Expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], Color Field painting initially appeared to be cool and austere. Color field painters efface the individual mark in favor of large, flat, stained and soaked areas of color, considered to be the essential nature of visual abstraction along with the actual shape of the canvas, which [[Frank Stella]] in particular achieved in unusual ways with combinations of curved and straight edges. However, Color Field painting has proven to be both sensual and deeply expressive albeit in a different way from gestural [[Abstract expressionism]]. Denying connection to Abstract Expressionism or any other Art Movement [[Mark Rothko]] spoke clearly about his paintings in 1956:
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''I am not an abstractionist ... I am not interested in the relationship of color or form or anything else. ... I'm interested only in expressing basic human emotions — tragedy, ecstasy, doom and so on — and the fact that a lot of people break down and cry when confronted with my pictures show that I communicate those basic human emotions. ... The people who weep before my pictures are having the same religious experience I had when I painted them. And if you, as you say, are moved only by their color relationships, then you miss the point!''&lt;ref&gt;Rodman, Selden. ''Conversations with Artists'', 1957. Later published in "Notes from a conversation with Selden Rodman, 1956" in ''Writings on Art: Mark Rothko'' 2006, edited by López-Remiro, Miguel.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Stain painting ===

[[Joan Miró]] was one of the first and most successful stain painters. Although staining in oil was considered dangerous to cotton canvas in the long run, Miró's example during the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s was an inspiration and an influence on the younger generation. One of the reasons for the success of the Color Field movement was the technique of staining. Artists would mix and dilute their paint in buckets or coffee cans making a fluid liquid and then they would pour it into raw unprimed canvas, generally [[cotton duck]]. The paint could also be brushed on or rolled on or thrown on or poured on or sprayed on, and would spread into the fabric of the canvas. Generally artists would draw shapes and areas as they stained. Many different artists employed staining as the technique of choice to use in making their paintings. [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Paul Jenkins (United States painter)|Paul Jenkins]] and dozens of other painters found that pouring and staining opened the door to innovations and revolutionary methods of drawing and expressing meaning in new ways. The number of artists who stained in the 1960s greatly increased with the availability of [[acrylic paint]]. Staining acrylic paint into the fabric of cotton duck canvas was more benign and less damaging to the fabric of the canvas than the use of oil paint.
In 1970 artist [[Helen Frankenthaler]] commented about her use of staining:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''When I first started doing the stain paintings, I left large areas of canvas unpainted, I think, because the canvas itself acted as forcefully and as positively as paint or line or color. In other words, the very ground was part of the medium, so that instead of thinking of it as background or negative space or an empty spot, that area did not need paint because it had paint next to it. The thing was to decide where to leave it and where to fill it and where to say this doesn't need another line or another pail of colors. It's saying it in space.''&lt;ref&gt;De Antonio, Emile. ''Painters Painting, a Candid History of The Modern Art Scene 1940-1970, P.82, Abbeville Press 1984, {{ISBN|0-89659-418-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Spray painting ===
{{main|Spray painting}}
Surprisingly few artists used the spray gun technique to create large expanses and fields of color sprayed across their canvases during the 1960s and 1970s. Some painters who effectively used [[spray painting]] techniques include [[Jules Olitski]], who was a pioneer in his spray technique that covered his large paintings with layer after layer of different colors, often gradually changing hue and value in subtle progression. Another important innovation was [[Dan Christensen]]'s use of a spray technique to great effect in loops and ribbons of bright color; sprayed in clear, calligraphic marks across his large-scale paintings. William Pettet, Richard Saba, and Albert Stadler, used the technique to create large-scale fields of multi-colors; while Kenneth Showell sprayed over crumpled canvases and created an illusion of abstract still-life interiors. Most of the spray painters were active especially during the late 1960s and 1970s.

=== Stripes ===

Stripes were one of the most popular vehicles for color used by several different Color Field painters in a variety of different formats. [[Barnett Newman]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jack Bush]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Kenneth Noland]] and David Simpson, all made important Series' of stripe paintings. Although he didn't call them stripes but ''zips'' Barnett Newman's stripes were mostly vertical, of varying widths and sparingly used. In Simpson and Noland's case their stripe paintings were all mostly horizontal, while Gene Davis painted vertical stripe paintings and Morris Louis mostly painted vertical stripe paintings sometimes called ''Pillars''. Jack Bush tended to do both horizontal and vertical stripe paintings as well as angular ones.

=== Magna paint ===
{{main|Magna paint}}
Magna, a special ''artist use'' [[acrylic paint]] was developed by [[Leonard Bocour]] and [[Sam Golden]] in 1947 and reformulated in 1960, specifically for Morris Louis and other stain painters of the color field movement.&lt;ref&gt;Henry, Walter.

=== Acrylic paint ===
{{main|Acrylic paint}}
In 1972, former [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] [[curator]] [[Henry Geldzahler]] said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Color field, curiously enough or perhaps not, became a viable way of painting at exactly the time that acrylic paint, the new plastic paint, came into being. It was as if the new paint demanded a new possibility in painting, and the painters arrived at it. Oil paint, which has a medium that is quite different, which isn't water-based, always leaves a slick of oil, or puddle of oil, around the edge of the color. Acrylic paint stops at its own edge.

Acrylics were first made commercially available in the 1950s as [[mineral spirits|mineral spirit]]-based paints called [[Magna paint|Magna]]&lt;ref&gt;Terry Fenton [http://www.sharecom.ca/noland/materials online essay] about [[Kenneth Noland]], and acrylic paint, accessed April 30th, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; offered by [[Leonard Bocour]]. Water-based acrylic paints were subsequently sold as "latex" house paints, although acrylic dispersion uses no [[latex]] derived from a [[Para rubber tree|rubber tree]]. Interior "latex" house paints tend to be a combination of [[Binder (material)|binder]] (sometimes acrylic, [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], [[Polyvinyl acetate|pva]] and others), [[filler (materials)|filler]], [[pigment]] and [[water]]. Exterior "latex" house paints may also be a "co-polymer" blend, but the very best exterior water-based paints are 100% acrylic.

Soon after the water-based acrylic binders were introduced as house paints, both artists – the first of whom were Mexican muralists – and companies began to explore the potential of the new binders. Acrylic artist paints can be thinned with water and used as [[wash (visual arts)|washes]] in the manner of watercolor paints, although the washes are fast and permanent once dry. Water-soluble artist-quality acrylic paints became commercially available in the early 1960s, offered by [[Liquitex]] and Bocour under the trade name of ''Aquatec.'' Water-soluble Liquitex and Aquatec proved to be ideally suited for stain painting. The staining technique with water-soluble acrylics made diluted colors sink and hold fast into raw [[canvas]]. Painters such as [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Sam Gilliam]] and others successfully used water-based acrylics for their new stain, color field paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Junker, Howard.

=== Legacy: influences and influenced ===

The ''Ocean Park series'' connects his earlier [[abstract expressionist]] works with Color field painting. The influence of both [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Joan Miró]] is particularly strong in this painting.]]

The [[Henri Matisse]] paintings ''French Window at Collioure,'' and ''View of Notre Dame''&lt;ref name="MoMA1"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=78863 ''View of Notre Dame, 1914'' at [[MoMA]], retrieved December 18, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; both from 1914 exerted tremendous influence on American Color Field painters in general (including [[Robert Motherwell]]'s ''Open Series'') and on Richard Diebenkorn's ''Ocean Park'' paintings specifically.]]
The ''painterly'' legacy of 20th-century painting is a long and intertwined mainstream of influences and complex interrelationships. The use of large opened fields of expressive color applied in generous painterly portions, accompanied by loose drawing (vague linear spots and/or figurative outline) can first be seen in the early 20th-century works of both [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Joan Miró]]. Matisse and Miró, as well as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and [[Piet Mondrian]] directly influenced the Abstract Expressionists, the Color Field painters of Post-Painterly Abstraction and the Lyrical Abstractionists. Late 19th-century Americans like [[Augustus Vincent Tack]] and [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]], along with early [[American Modernism|American Modernists]] like [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Arthur Dove]], and [[Milton Avery]]'s landscapes also provided important precedents and were influences on the Abstract Expressionists, the Color Field painters, and the Lyrical Abstractionists. [[Henri Matisse]] paintings ''French Window at Collioure,'' and ''View of Notre Dame''&lt;ref name="MoMA1" /&gt; both from 1914 exerted tremendous influence on American Color Field painters in general, (including [[Robert Motherwell]]'s ''Open Series''), and on Richard Diebenkorn's ''Ocean Park'' paintings specifically. According to [[art historian]] Jane Livingston, Diebenkorn saw both Matisse paintings in an exhibition in Los Angeles in 1966, and they had an enormous impact on him and his work.&lt;ref name="Jane6267"&gt;Livingston, Jane. "The Art of [[Richard Diebenkorn]]". In: 1997-1998 Exhibition catalog, [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]. 62-67. {{ISBN|0-520-21257-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jane Livingston says about the January 1966 Matisse exhibition that Diebenkorn saw in Los Angeles:
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''It is difficult not to ascribe enormous weight to this experience for the direction his work took from that time on. Two pictures he saw there reverberate in almost every ''Ocean Park'' canvas. View of Notre Dame and French Window at Collioure, both painted in 1914, were on view for the first time in the US.''&lt;ref name="Jane6267" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Livingston goes on to say ''Diebenkorn must have experienced French Window at Collioure, as an epiphany.''&lt;ref&gt;Livingston, Jane.  ''The Art of [[Richard Diebenkorn]]''. In 1997-1998 Exhibition catalog, [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]. 64. {{ISBN|0-520-21257-6}},&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joan Miró]] was one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. Miró pioneered the technique of staining; creating blurry, multi-colored cloudy backgrounds in thinned oil paint throughout the 1920s and 1930s; on top of which he added his calligraphy, characters and abundant lexicon of words, and imagery. [[Arshile Gorky]] openly admired Miró's work and painted Miró-like Gorky paintings, before finally discovering his own originality in the early 1940s. During the 1960s Miró painted large (abstract expressionist scale) radiant fields of vigorously brushed paint in blue, in white, and other monochromatic fields of colors; with blurry black orbs and calligraphic stone-like shapes, floating at random. These works resembled the Color Field paintings of the younger generation. Biographer [[Jacques Dupin]] said this about Miró's work of the early 1960s:
&lt;blockquote&gt; These canvases disclose affinities – Miró does not in the least attempt to deny this – with the researches of a new generation of painters. Many of these, [[Jackson Pollock]] for one, have acknowledged their debt to Miró. Miró in turn displays lively interest in their work and never misses an opportunity to encourage and support them. Nor does he consider it beneath his dignity to use their discoveries on some occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Dupin, Jacques. ''[[Joan Miró]] Life and Work''. New York City: Harry N. Abrams, 1962. 481&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Taking its example from other European modernists like Joan Miró, the Color Field movement encompasses several decades from the mid 20th century through the early 21st century. Color Field painting actually encompasses three separate but related generations of painters. Commonly used terms to refer to the three separate but related groups are [[Abstract expressionism]], [[Post-Painterly Abstraction]], and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. Some of the artists made works in all three eras, that relate to all of the three styles. Color Field pioneers such as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and [[Robert Motherwell]] are primarily thought of as Abstract Expressionists. Artists like [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Jules Olitski]], and [[Kenneth Noland]] were of a slightly younger generation, or in the case of [[Morris Louis]] esthetically aligned with that generation's point of view; that started out as Abstract Expressionists but quickly moved to Post-Painterly Abstraction. While younger artists like [[Frank Stella]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Dan Christensen]], began with Post-Painterly Abstraction and eventually moved forward towards a new type of expressionism, referred to as [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. Many of the artists mentioned, as well as many others, have practiced all three modes at one phase of their careers or another. During the later phases of Color Field painting; as reflections of the [[zeitgeist]] of the late 1960s (in which everything began to ''hang loose)'' and the [[angst]] of the age (with all of the uncertainties of the time) merged with the gestalt of [[Post-Painterly Abstraction]], producing [[Lyrical Abstraction]] which combined precision of the Color Field idiom with the malerische of the [[Abstract Expressionists]]. During the same period of the late 1960s, and early 1970s in Europe, [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Anselm Kiefer]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.whitecube.com/artists/kiefer/ White Cube: Anselm Kiefer]".  White Cube. Retrieved December 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and several other painters also began producing works of intense expression, merging abstraction with images, incorporating landscape imagery, and figuration that by the late 1970s was referred to as [[Neo-expressionism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2639">The '''Earth Group''' ([[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Grupa Zemlja'') was a Croatian [[arts collective]] active in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] from 1929 to 1935. The group aimed to defend their artistic independence against foreign influences such as [[Impressionism]] or [[Neoclassicism]] and ''[[art for art's sake]]''. They maintained that art should mirror the social milieu from which it springs and should meet contemporary needs, hence their emphasis on the popularization of art, both at home and abroad. In spite of its ideologically heterogeneous membership, the group was considered [[Marxism|Marxist]] in orientation but never espoused [[socialist realism]].

==Members and guests==
*Founding members of the group: sculptors [[Antun Augustinčić]] and [[Frano Kršinić]]; painters [[Vinko Grdan]], [[Krsto Hegedušić]], Leo Junek, Omer Mujadžić, [[Oton Postružnik]], Kamilo Ružička and [[Ivan Tabaković]]; and the architect [[Drago Ibler]] (who also served as the group's chairman).
*Members who later joined the group: Marijan Detoni, [[Ivan Generalić]], Željko Hegedušić, Fedor Vaić, Vilim Svečnjak, [[Edo Kovačević]], Branka Hegedušić-Frangeš, Ernest Tomašević, [[Lavoslav Horvat]], [[Stjepan Planić]] and Mladen Kauzlarić.
*Guest artists whose works were shown at some of the group's exhibitions: [[Otti Berger]], Petar Franjić, Drago Galić, [[Stjepan Gomboš]], Aleksander Mikloš, [[Franjo Mraz]], Josip Pičman, Danilo Raušević, [[Petar Smajić]], and Zdenko Strižić.

==Biography==
Born in 1775 or 1776 as the first of John Utterson of [[Fareham]], Hampshire (who was the secretary of Sir [[Edward Vernon]]) and his wife Elizabeth's ({{nee}} Elizabeth Rowe) eight children, he was baptised on 14 July 1777 at Holy Trinity church, [[Gosport]]. He was educated at [[Eton College]], entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] on 17 February 1794, and [[Lincoln's Inn]] on 31 October 1794. He matriculated from Trinity College in [[Michaelmas term]] 1797 and was admitted pensioner on 17 February 1798, graduating [[Bachelor of Laws]] in 1801,&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=UTR794EV|name=Utterson, Edward Vernon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and being called to the bar as a [[barrister]] on 1 February 1802.&lt;ref name=GEN&gt;[http://www.webrarian.co.uk/phpGedView/individual.php?pid=I4130&amp;ged=Goddard.ged&amp;tab=-1 Utterson family tree], Webrarian&lt;/ref&gt;

He married [[Sarah Elizabeth Utterson|Sarah Elizabeth Brown]] (1781–1851), daughter of the banker and radical [[Timothy Brown (radical)|Timothy Brown]], on 2 May 1803; she translated ''[[Tales of the Dead]]'' in 1813, and together they had several children. He practised in the [[Court of Chancery]] and was appointed to be one of the [[Six Clerks]] in Chancery in 1815, which post he retained until it was abolished in 1842, whereupon he retired, retaining his full salary.&lt;ref name=BAB/&gt; He was appointed [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] of [[Chichester]] in 1817, where his father had been [[portreeve]], and he had been made customer for £12 1s in 1800; he appointed William Johnson of Chichester as his deputy, and continued in the post until he resigned in 1820, at which time the council made a resolution that "At this Assembly this Body entertain a Deep Sense of the Ability, Zeal and impartiality with which Edward Vernon Utterson Esquire has discharged his important Duties as Recorder ... and they feel the most unfeigned regret that Circumstances have compelled him to Resign ..."&lt;ref name=Sussex/&gt;

Politically, he was "an uncompromising [[Tory]] of the old school, and a most implacable enemy of the system of '[[retrenchment]]' which followed in the wake of the passing of the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill]]". Utterson lived at 1 Elm Court, [[Temple, London|Temple]], and 19 Great Ormond Street while a member of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] from 1805 to 1806, then 32 Great Coram Street, [[Brunswick Square]], London by 1811, and 32 York Terrace, [[Regent's Park]] by 1829, but from about 1835 he resided first at [[Newport, Isle of Wight]], before moving to [[Ryde]], living first at Buckland Grange (which before his time was a farm called Ryde House; this name was transferred to a new house built nearer the sea by George Player), and then building Beldornie Tower, Pelham Field, where he set up the Beldornie Press in 1840. When [[Edward Dawes]] was elected Member of Parliament for the [[Isle of Wight (UK Parliament constituency)|Isle of Wight]] in May 1851 on the principles of [[free trade]], Utterson "took such umbrage that he removed from Ryde", though he and his wife had been registered as living at 16 Suffolk Street, [[St Martin in the Fields (parish)|St Martins in the Fields]], London, during the [[United Kingdom Census 1851|1851 Census]], held two months before.&lt;ref name="N&amp;Q 10 6"&gt;{{cite journal

His wife died on 22 September 1851, and after this he held the first sale of his library, from 19 to 27 April 1852. Utterson himself died aged 80 on 14 July 1856 at Upper Brunswick Place, [[Hove]], [[Brighton]], and was buried at Fareham. There are memorial tablets in St Thomas's Church, Ryde, to him and his wife.&lt;ref name=BAB/&gt;&lt;ref name="N&amp;Q 10 6"/&gt;

[[File:Louis Fagan, Collectors Marks, 173, Edward Utterson.png|thumb|Edward Utterson's collector's mark]]

===Collector===
Like his father, Utterson was a collector of books, drawings and prints, and has been described as "a book-collector of real importance and high rank. He had taste, knowledge and experience".&lt;ref name=contributions&gt;Quaritch, Bernard and Burbidge, Edward, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LlxCuZ79JHsC Contributions Towards a Dictionary of English Book Collectors]''&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that he must have started his collection early in the 19th century, and he was elected a fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] in 1807. He was one of the eighteen members who founded the [[Roxburghe Club]] at dinner at the St. Albans Tavern, St Albans Street, London, on 17 June 1812, which he remained a member of until his death in 1856.&lt;ref name=BAB/&gt;&lt;ref name=BM&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=104680 British Museum – Term details: Edward Utterson]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TRC&gt;[http://www.roxburgheclub.org.uk/membership/index.php?MemberID=17 The Roxburghe Club – Member 17]&lt;/ref&gt;

He edited a number of books from 1812 to 1839, and then founded his own press, Beldornie Press, publishing a number of notable reprints from 1840–1843. These books were printed in very limited numbers, of no more than about twelve to twenty, each copy numbered in print or handwriting. Utterson presented a copy of all of these to [[John Payne Collier]] on discovering the interest he had in early English literature. Collier discovered a number of inconsistencies in the books, which he attributed primarily to the scribes and [[Compositor (typesetting)|compositor]]s employed by Utterson for Beldornie Press, and published a note to that effect in the 5 January 1856 issue of ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', assuming Utterson to be dead. Utterson quickly wrote to him in person, informing him that he was alive and well, and Collier wrote a second note in the next issue, apologising for the confusion. His warning over the accuracy of the Beldornie Press reprints, however, still stands.&lt;ref name = DNB&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28039 Oxford DNB article: Utterson, Edward Vernon], subscription only&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artist===
Utterson was also a talented amateur artist, and many of his works remain in the [[British Museum]] to this day.&lt;ref name=BAB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_results.aspx?orig=%2Fresearch%2Fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;searchText=Edward+Vernon+Utterson&amp;x=12&amp;y=18&amp;titleSubject=on&amp;physicalAttribute=on&amp;productionInfo=on&amp;fromDate=&amp;fromadbc=ad&amp;toDate=&amp;toadbc=ad British Museum archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yachtsman===
Utterson owned the [[yacht]] ''Iris'' of [[Ryde]], and was elected a member of the English division of the Royal Western Yacht Squadron in [[Portsmouth]] on 27 October 1835.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLcRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA694 The Court Journal, Vol. 7, #340, October 31, 1835, p. 694]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also made a Trustee of the Royal Victoria Yacht Club in Ryde, [[Isle of Wight]].&lt;ref name=BAB/&gt;

==Sales==
As a notable collector, sales of Utterson's books, prints and so on were well advertised events at the time. The first sale of his books was during his lifetime, probably induced by ill health. It ran for eight days from 19 to 27 April 1852, auctioned by [[Sotheby's|S.L. Sotheby &amp; J. Wilkinson]], realising £4805, and was followed by the auction of his collection of drawings and engravings.

The second sale of his book collection ran for seven days, from 20 to 27 March 1857, eight months after his death, and amounted to £4050.&lt;ref name=BAB/&gt;&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=contributions/&gt;

The '''English Folk Dance and Song Society''' ('''EFDSS''', or pronounced 'EFF-diss'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVTMoN4Arvo Challenges of Designing the Roud Folk Song Index], Library of Congress, YouTube, 9:00&lt;/ref&gt;) was formed in 1932 when two organisations merged: the Folk-Song Society and the English Folk Dance Society.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[[Karpeles, Maud]] and Frogley, Alain (2007–2011).

The English Folk Dance Society was founded in 1911 by [[Cecil Sharp]]. [[Maud Karpeles]] was a leading participant.  Its purpose was to preserve and promote [[English country dances|English folk dances]] in their traditional forms, including [[Morris dance|Morris]] and [[sword dances]], traditional [[social dances]], and interpretations of the dances published by [[John Playford]].

One of the greatest contributions that the EFDSS made to the folk movement, both dance and song, was the folk festival, starting with the [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] Festival in the 1940s and later festivals in [[Whitby]], [[Sidmouth Festival|Sidmouth]], [[Holmfirth]], [[Chippenham]] and elsewhere.

==Publications==
Since 1936 the EFDSS has published ''English Dance &amp; Song'' at least four times a year. This has become the longest-established magazine devoted to folk music, dance and song in the country. ''English Dance &amp; Song'' is aimed at stimulating the interest of the membership of the EFDSS, as well as the wider folk music and dance community.

Their regular scholarly publication is ''Folk Music Journal'', published annually in December, which was formerly entitled the ''Journal of the English Folk Dance and Song Society'' until 1965. The work continues the earlier journals of the two societies: ''Journal of the Folk-Song Society'', 1899–1931;&lt;ref&gt;Dean-Smith, Margaret (1951). [https://www.jstor.org/pss/4521357 'The Preservation of English Folk Song in the Journal of the Folk Song Society'].

Retrieved 24 October 2011 {{subscription}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Journal of the English Folk Dance Society 191431''.

==Recent developments==
[[Image:Cecil Sharp House-1.jpg|thumb|Cecil Sharp House in Regent's Park, London, is home to the English Folk Dance and Song Society]]

In 1998, with the folk movement strongly supported by a number of other organisations and the seeds planted by EFDSS thriving, the EFDSS altered its strategy to focus on education and archiving, with its primary goal the development of the [[Vaughan Williams Memorial Library]] as the country's national archive and resource centre for folk music, dance and song. 

In 2011 the society entered into a joint commission with [[Shrewsbury Folk Festival]] to create the [[Cecil Sharp Project]], a multi-artist residential commission to create new works based on the life and collecting of [[Cecil Sharp]].  The project took place in March 2011, the artists involved being: [[Steve Knightley]], [[Andy Cutting]], [[Leonard Podolak]], [[Jim Moray]], [[Jackie Oates]], [[Caroline Herring]], [[Kathryn Roberts]] and Patsy Reid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cecil Sharp Project |url=https://www.efdss.org/efdss-artists-development/commissions/cecil-sharp-project |website=English Folk Dance and Song Society |accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, EFDSS launched [[The Full English (folk music archive)|The Full English]], an ongoing archive project supported by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], [[The Folklore Society]], the National Folk Music Fund and the English Miscellany Folk Dance Group. This free and searchable resource of 44,000 records and over 58,000 digitised images is the world's biggest digital archive of traditional music and dance tunes.&lt;ref name="archive launch"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chilton|first=Martin|title='Staggering' digital folk music archive launched|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/10134011/Staggering-digital-folk-music-archive-launched.html|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as folk music, the EFDSS is home to a number of performance artists, providing a regular performance platform for acts including the [[Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain]], the [[Massive Violins]] and the [[The Swingle Singers|Swingle Singers]].

The '''Externsteine relief''' is a monumental [[rock relief]] depiction of the [[Descent from the Cross]] scene, carved into the side of the [[Externsteine]] [[sandstone]] formation in the [[Teutoburg Forest]]. The Externsteine are located near [[Detmold]], now in the German state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] but in the Middle Ages in the [[Duchy of Saxony]]. 

It is the oldest relief of this type known north of the Alps, dated to the high medieval period (likely the 12th century).&lt;ref name="date"&gt;Otto Schmitt: "Zur Datierung des Externsteinreliefs".

==Description==
The relief measures 4.8 m high by 3.7 m wide.&lt;ref name="Booklet"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Treude|first1=Elke|last2=Zelle|first2=Michael|title=Externsteine (German)|publisher=Lippischer Heimatbund|year=2012|isbn=978-3-941726-18-5|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}

It is divided into three parts, or ''registers''. The largest, central register shows the Descent from the Cross scene itself. At the center is the cross, to the right is a figure identified as  [[Nicodemus]]. The legs of this figure have been lost since at least the 17th century, but it is shown at an elevated position, aiding in the recovery of Jesus' body from the cross. The figure was standing  supporting structure (identified either as a plant bent by Nicodemus' weight, or as a chair). Nicodemus lowers the body of Jesus towards [[Joseph of Arimathea]], who is standing to the left of the cross. To the left of Joseph is the figure of [[Mary, Mother of Jesus]] (the head of this figure has been lost), with her hand supporting the head of her son's corpse. Opposite Mary, on the right side of the scene, is [[John the Apostle]], holding a book.&lt;ref name="Booklet"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

The upper register shows the torso of the [[ascension of Jesus|ascended Christ]] wearing a cross [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] and a victory flag. Alongside the flag, the figure is holding a small representation of a human figure with raised hands. To the left and right, anthropomorphic representations of Sun and Moon are shown, holding drapes.&lt;ref name="Booklet"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

The lower register shows two kneeling figures, a naked bearded man and a clothed figure of undetermined sex, both of them caught in the coils of the neck and tail of a two-legged, winged dragon. These figures were variously identified as [[Adam and Eve]] (representing the fallen state of man in general),&lt;ref name="Booklet"/&gt;{{rp|4}} or as a Saxon warrior and priest.

==Controversy about symbolism and dating==
The structure shown as supporting Nicodemus has gained some notability as a supposed representation of a "bent [[Irminsul]]", reflecting the theory, first suggested in the 1870s, that Externsteine was the site of the national sanctuary of the pagan [[Saxons]]. 

It could alternatively be a bent palm tree.&lt;ref name="Booklet"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

[[Goethe]] writing in 1824 identified the relief as a work of the [[Carolingian art|Carolingian period]]. In the same year Karl Theodor Menke dated it to the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Theodor Menke: ''Lage, Ursprung, Namen, Beschreibung, Altherthum, Mythus und Geschichte der Extersteine''. Coppenrathsche Buch- und Kunsthandlung, Münster o.J. (1824; reprinted 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians of the later 19th and early 20th century tended to support Goethe's view of an early date of origin, but a re-examination of the evidence by a team of art historians in 1950 resulted in a shift of ''communis opinio'' towards a high medieval date.&lt;ref name="date"/&gt; The view of the relief as of Carolingian date remains a minority position, especially popular by authors who would like to identify the "plant-like" structure as a representation of Irminsul, e.g. in a  1997  [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophical]] publication.&lt;ref&gt;Walther Matthes, Rolf Speckner: Das Relief an den Externsteinen. Ein karolingisches Kunstwerk und sein spiritueller Hintergrund. edition tertium, Ostfildern vor Stuttgart 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today, the consensus remains that the relief probably dates to 1160/70.&lt;ref name="Booklet"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

The '''F1 Sculpture Project''' was five weeks of installation, performance and video art held in [[Wellington]], New Zealand in 1982. Art historian [[Tina Barton]] places the event within the history of post-object art in New Zealand, a movement that "extended sculpture into temporary, multi-part, mixed-media, largely ephemeral situations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barton|first1=Christina|title=Post-object and conceptual art – What is post-object art|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/post-object-and-conceptual-art/page-1|website=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand,|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed to "address the lack of support and increase exposure for sculptors", the project was initiated by Ian Hunter, an Irish-born artist and gallery professional who lived in New Zealand between 1970 and 1984, and who "played an important role in fostering post-object art" in Wellington by setting up alternative exhibiting opportunities including the Artists' Co-op (1977–1979), the F1 Sculpture Project (1982) and ANZART, a New Zealand-Australian artist event held in [[Christchurch]] in 1981, [[Hobart]] in 1983 and [[Auckland]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barton|first1=Christina|title=Post-object and conceptual art – The rise of post-object art|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/post-object-and-conceptual-art/page-2|website=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Intervention"&gt;{{cite book|title=Intervention: Post Object and Performance Art in New Zealand in 1970 and beyond|date=2000|publisher=Robert McDougall Art Gallery and Annex|location=Christchurch|url=https://christchurchartgallery.org.nz/media/uploads/2016_09/Intervention2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; F1 was implemented by a group of New Zealand artists, including David Mealing, Stuart Griffiths,
Barbara Strathdee, Mary Louise Brown and [[Vivian Lynn]].&lt;ref name = 'Intervention'/&gt;

The event took place in a disused factory space (hence "F1"), the Teal Lemonade Factory, on [[Tory Street]] in the central city.&lt;ref name = 'Intervention'/&gt;&lt;ref name="Community"&gt;{{cite web|title=Factory 1 (F1) Sculpture Project 1982|url=http://thecommunityarchive.org.nz/node/65922/description|website=The Community Archives|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project had four parts:

*presentations of works by over 100 sculptors from New Zealand, Britain and Australia
*workshops which included then-experimental visual art media including dance, video, sound and audio-visual works
*lectures, seminars and panel discussions
*performances, jazz concerts, and film and slide presentations.&lt;ref name = 'Community'/&gt;

F1 ran from 8 November to 2 December 1982 and was supported by the New Zealand Sculpture Council, [[Creative New Zealand | QE II Arts Council]] and the National Art Gallery (now the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]]).&lt;ref name = 'Community'/&gt;

In an account of New Zealand performance art between 1970 and 1985, art historian Jennifer Hay described F1 as "a major event and unqualified success in building a premise with which future artists could expand", by pooling resources and time.&lt;ref name = 'Intervention'/&gt; Exhibiting artists included [[Greer Twiss]], Don Driver, [[Pauline Rhodes]], Stuart Griffiths, [[Jacqueline Fraser]], Andrew Drummond, John Cousins, [[Jack Body]], Chris Cree-Brown ,Colleen Anstey and Paul Butt &lt;ref name = 'Intervention'/&gt; 

Hay also notes that the event "provided the opportunity to debate feminist issues in the arts and to address the problem of invisibility for women artists."&lt;ref name = 'Intervention'/&gt; A two-day seminar was held on women's sculpture and a "discussion of feminist goals" saw the establishment of the National Women Artist's Association.&lt;ref name = 'Intervention'/&gt; In an article in ''Art New Zealand'', artist and event co-organiser Barbara Srathdee documented works presented at F1 by women artists including Kate Coolahan, Pauline Rhodes, Jacqueline Fraser, [[Di Ffrench]], Mary Louise Brown, Colleen Anstey, and Vivian Lynn, and visiting Irish artist Rose Ann McCreery and Canadian artist Evelyn Roth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strathdee|first1=Barbara|title=Women Artists at the F1 New Zealand Sculpture Project|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Autumn 1983|issue=26|url=http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issues21to30/womenf1.htm|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''foreword''' is a (usually short) piece of writing sometimes placed at the beginning of a book or other piece of [[literature]].  Typically written by someone other than the primary author of the work, it often tells of some interaction between the writer of the foreword and the book's primary author or the story the book tells.  Later editions of a book sometimes have a new foreword prepended (appearing before an older foreword if there was one), which might explain in what respects that edition differs from previous ones.

When written by the author, the foreword may cover the story of how the book came into being or how the idea for the book was developed, and may include thanks and acknowledgments to people who were helpful to the author during the time of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Pope| first = Geoff| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = "Foreword" Versus "Forward" | work = Grammar Girl's Quick and Dirty Tips| publisher = Macmillan Holdings, LLC| date = 18 November 2010| url = http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/forward-versus-foreword.aspx| format = | doi = | accessdate = 10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a [[preface]], a foreword is always signed.

Information essential to the main text is generally placed in a set of explanatory notes, or perhaps in an [[introduction (essay)|introduction]], rather than in the foreword or preface.

The pages containing the foreword and preface (and other front matter) are typically not numbered as part of the main work, which usually uses [[Arabic numerals]].  If the front matter is paginated, it uses lowercase [[Roman numerals]].  If there is both a foreword and a preface, the foreword appears first; both appear before the introduction, which may be paginated either with the front matter or the main text.

The word ''foreword'' was first used around the mid-17th century, originally as a term in [[philology]]. It was possibly a [[calque]] of [[German (language)|German]] ''Vorwort'', itself a calque of Latin ''praefatio''.

'''François Zourabichvili''' (1965 – 19 April 2006) was a French philosopher specialized in the works of [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]].

==Biography==
François Zourabichvili was the son of composer [[Nicolas Zourabichvili]], nephew of historian [[Hélène Carrère d'Encausse]], and cousin of author [[Emmanuel Carrère]].&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Carrère. (2007). ''Un roman russe''. Paris: Pol.&lt;/ref&gt; He became [[agrégé]] in 1989 and earned his [[PhD]] in Philosophy in 1999. He taught at a [[lycee]] already from 1988 to 2001, was docent at [[Paul Valéry University, Montpellier III]], and a director at the [[Collège international de philosophie]] from 1998 to 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inmanencia.com/2010/07/vertiges-de-spinoza-tumba-para.html &amp;#91;Vertiges de Spinoza&amp;#93;: Tumba para ZOURABICHVILI"], ''Inmanencia'', Retrieved 01 February 2014 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He committed suicide in 2006 and is buried in the Russian Church of the Holy Trinity in Paris (XVIe arrondissement).

A year after Zourabichvili's death, the Collège international de philosophie and the [[École normale supérieure]] organized a colloquium upon ''Les physiques de la pensée selon François Zourabichvili'' ("The physics of the thinking according to François Zourabichvili") led by [[Bruno Clément]] and [[Frédéric Worms]]. The event took place with the participation of [[Pierre Macherey]], [[Pierre-François Moreau]], [[Pierre Zaoui]], [[Paola Marrati]], [[Paul R. Patton]], [[Paolo Godani]] and [[Marie-France Badie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://revue-klesis.org/pdf/EDITO-FZ-1.pdf EDITO-FZ-1], Klesis Revue Philosophique, Retrieved 01 February 2014 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ciepfc.rhapsodyk.net/article.php3?id_article=129 Les physiques de la pensée selon François Zourabichvili"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324044207/http://ciepfc.rhapsodyk.net/article.php3?id_article=129 |date=2008-03-24 }}, ''RhapSodyK'', Retrieved 24 March 2008 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
François Zourabichvili worked primarily on the concepts of "''event''" and "''littéralité''", inspired by the philosophy of Deleuze.
In addition, he wrote about [[aesthetics]], a discipline in which he centered his interest for the purpose of finding relations between [[art]] and [[game]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actu-philosophia.com/spip.php?article354 François Zourabichvili : La littéralité et autres essais sur l’art.], ''ACTU PHILOSOPHIA'', Retrieved 01 February 2014 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published some articles about the films of [[Boris Barnet]] and [[Dziga Vertov]].

The '''Freer Gallery of Art''' and the [[Arthur M. Sackler Gallery]] form the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s national museums of [[Culture of Asia|Asian]] art in the United States. The Freer and Sackler galleries house the largest Asian art research library in the country and contain [[art]] from [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Islamic world]], the [[ancient Near East]], and [[ancient Egypt]], as well as a significant collection of [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. The gallery is located on the south side of the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], contiguous with the Sackler Gallery. The museum is open 364 days a year (being closed on [[Christmas]]), and is administered by a single staff with the Sackler Gallery. The galleries are among the [[List of most visited art museums in the world|most visited art museums in the world]].

The Freer houses over 26,000 objects spanning 6,000 years of history from the [[Neolithic]] to [[Modern art|modern]] eras. The collections include ancient Egyptian stone sculpture and wooden objects, ancient Near Eastern ceramics and metalware, [[Chinese painting]]s and [[Chinese ceramics|ceramics]], [[Korean pottery and porcelain]], Japanese [[folding screen]]s, Persian [[manuscript]]s, and [[Buddhist art|Buddhist sculpture]]. In addition to Asian art, the Freer also contains the famous ''[[The Peacock Room|Harmony in Blue and Gold: The Peacock Room]]'' (better known as ''The Peacock Room'') by American artist [[James McNeill Whistler]] which serves as the centerpiece to the Freer's [[Visual art of the United States|American art]] collection.

The museum offers free tours to the public and presents a full schedule events for the public including films, lectures, symposia, concerts, performances, and discussions. Over 11,000 objects from the Freer|Sackler collections are  fully searchable and available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/ |title=Collections &amp;#124; Freer and Sackler Galleries |publisher=Asia.si.edu |date=2013-03-15 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Freer was also featured in the [[Google Art Project]], which offers online viewers close-up views of selected items from the Freer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/freer-gallery-of-art-smithsonian/ |title=Freer&amp;#124;Sackler: The Smithsonian's Museums of Asian Art - Google Cultural Institute |publisher=Googleartproject.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Freer Gallery 1.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance to the Freer Gallery of Art]]

===Founding===
The gallery was founded by [[Detroit]] railroad-car manufacturer and self-taught connoisseur [[Charles Lang Freer]]. He owned the largest collection of works by American artist James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903) and became a patron and friend of the famously irascible artist. Whistler made it very clear to Freer that if he helped him to build the premier Whistler collection, then that collection would have to be displayed in a city where tourists went.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Merrill, a former curator of American art at the Freer Gallery, editor of With Kindest Regards: The Correspondence of Charles Lang Freer and James McNeill Whistler, and co-author of Freer: A Legacy of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, Charles Moore, a former aide to Michigan United States Senator, James McMillin and the chairman of the [[United States Commission of Fine Arts]], moved from Washington, D.C., to Detroit. Moore became friends with Freer, who was director of the [[Michigan Car Company]], and persuaded Freer to permanently exhibit his 8,000-piece collection of Oriental art in Washington, D.C. Before then, Freer informally proposed to President Theodore Roosevelt that he give to the nation his art collection, funds to construct a building, and an endowment fund to provide for the study and acquisition of "very fine examples of Oriental, Egyptian, and Near Eastern fine arts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://siarchives.si.edu/history/freer-gallery-art Smithsonian Institution Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

Travelers impressed by the beauty of the National Mall in Washington, D.C., can thank three Detroiters for their role in creating it. 
The mall was the brainchild of James McMillan, a Michigan United States senator and former business competitor to Freer. Charles Freer for his enormous donation to the Smithsonian, and Moore for carrying out the Washington mall concept. The Freer gift was accepted on behalf of the government by the Smithsonian Board of Regents in 1906. Freer's will, however, contained certain requirements that only objects from the permanent collection could be exhibited in the gallery, and that none of the art could be exhibited elsewhere. Freer felt strongly that all of the museum's holding should be readily accessible to scholars at all times.  In addition, Freer's bequest to the Smithsonian came with the proviso that he would execute full curatorial control over the collection until his death.  The Smithsonian initially hesitated at the requirements but the intercession of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] allowed for the project to proceed. The Freer Gallery possesses an autographed letter from Roosevelt inviting Freer to visit him at the White House, reflecting the personal interest Roosevelt showed in the development of the museum. Freer died before the art gallery was completed.

===Construction and architecture===
Construction of the gallery began in 1916 and was completed in 1921, after a delay due to World War I.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian Institution Archives"&gt;Smithsonian Institution Archives&lt;/ref&gt; On May 9, 1923, the Freer Gallery of Art was opened to the public. Designed by American architect and landscape planner [[Charles A. Platt]], the Freer is an Italian Renaissance-style building inspired by Freer's visits to palazzos in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Caemmerer, H. Paul. "Charles Moore and the Plan of Washington." ''Records of the Columbia Historical Society.'' Vol. 46/47 (1944/1945): 237-258, 256.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is reported that in a meeting with architect Charles Platt at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, Freer jotted down his ideas for a classical, well-proportioned building on a napkin.&lt;ref name="asia.si.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/about/charleslangfreer.asp |title=Charles Lang Freer &amp;#124; About Us &amp;#124; Freer and Sackler Galleries |publisher=Asia.si.edu |date=2013-03-15 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gallery is constructed primarily of granite: the exterior of the Freer is pink granite quarried in Milford, Massachusetts, the courtyard has a carnelian granite fountain and walls of unpolished Tennessee white marble. The gallery's interior walls are Indiana limestone, and the floors are polished Tennessee marble.

A major renovation of the building, which culminated in a grand reopening in 1993, greatly expanded storage and exhibition space by connecting the Freer and the [[Arthur M. Sackler Gallery]]. With the addition of the connecting gallery, the Freer has 39,039 square feet of public space. The original structure designed by Platt remains intact, including the Eugene and Agnes E. Meyer Auditorium which serves as the venue for many public programs.

=== Current ===
After opening in 1923, the Freer served as the Smithsonian's first museum dedicated to the fine arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/about/freer.asp |title=The Freer Gallery of Art &amp;#124; About Us &amp;#124; Freer and Sackler Galleries |publisher=Asia.si.edu |date=2013-03-15 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Freer was also the first Smithsonian museum created from a private collector's bequest.  Through the years, the collections have grown through gifts and purchases to nearly triple the size of Freer's original donation: nearly 18,000 works of Asian art have been added since Freer's death in 1919.

The Freer is now connected by an underground exhibition space to the neighboring [[Arthur M. Sackler Gallery]]. Although their collections are stored and exhibited separately, the two museums share a director, administration, and staff. The Freer closed for extensive renovations in January 2016 and reopened in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freer Gallery of Art To Reopen After Nearly Two Years|url=https://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/freer-gallery-art-reopen-after-nearly-two-years|website=newsdesk.si.edu|publisher=Smithsonian|accessdate=4 March 2018|language=en|date=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Because one of the main conditions of [[Charles Lang Freer]] donation was that only items from his collection may be exhibited at the gallery, the Freer does not borrow from or lend out items to other institutions.  However, due to the 26,000 objects in the gallery's collections, they are still able to present exhibitions internationally recognized for both depth and quality.

The Freer also has a number rotating/temporary exhibits.

==American art at the Freer==
[[File:The Peacock Room (2).jpg|thumb|''The Peacock Room'' by Whistler]]
Freer began collecting American art in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="asia.si.edu"/&gt; In 1890, after meeting [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], an American artist influenced by Japanese prints and Chinese ceramics, Freer began to expand his collections to include Asian art. He maintained his interest in American art, however, amassing a collection of over 1,300 works by Whistler, which is considered the world's finest.

One of the most well-known exhibits at the Freer is ''[[The Peacock Room]]'', an opulent London dining room painted by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] in 1876–77. The room was designed for British shipping magnate [[Frederick Richards Leyland|F.R. Leyland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/online/peacock/default.htm |title=A Closer Look - James McNeill Whistler - Peacock Room |publisher=Asia.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is lavishly decorated with green and gold peacock motifs. Purchased by Freer in 1904 and installed in the Freer Gallery after his death, ''The Peacock Room'' is on permanent display.

The Freer also has works by [[Thomas Dewing]] (1851–1938), [[Dwight Tryon]] (1849–1925), [[Abbott Handerson Thayer]] (1849–1921), [[Childe Hassam]] (1859–1935), [[Winslow Homer]] (1836–1910), [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] (1848–1907), [[Willard Metcalf]] (1858–1925), [[John Singer Sargent]] (1856–1925), and [[John Twachtman]] (1853–1902).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/american.asp |title=Freer and Sackler Galleries &amp;#124; Collections |publisher=Asia.si.edu |date=2013-03-15 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==F|S Online==

The Freer|Sackler provides several online resources for exploring the art and culture of Asia and its American art collections. Besides the collections objects viewable online, thousands of photographs, archeological diaries, maps, and archaeological squeezes (impressions of carvings) have been digitized and are used by researchers from around the world.

==F|S Archives and Library==
[[File:Dish from 9th century Iraq.jpg|thumb|This [[earthenware]] dish from 9th century [[Abbasid]] [[Iraq]] is one of the many artifacts exhibited at the Freer Gallery.]]

The Freer Sackler Archives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/research/archives.asp|title=Archives - Freer-Sackler|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; houses over 120 important manuscripts collections relevant to the study of America's encounter with Asian art and culture.  The core collection is the personal papers of gallery founder Charles Lang Freer, which includes his purchase records, diaries, and personal correspondence with public figures such as artists, dealers and collectors.  Freer's extensive correspondence with [[James McNeill Whistler]] forms one of the largest sources of primary documents about the American artist.  Other significant collections in the Archives includes the papers (notebooks, letters, photography, squeezes) and personal objects of the German archaeologist [[Ernst Herzfeld]] (1879–1946), documenting his research at [[Samarra]], [[Persepolis]] and [[Pasargadae]]. The papers of [[Carl Whiting Bishop]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siarchives&amp;uri=full=3100001~!283455~!0#focus|title=The Carl Whiting Bishop Collection|first=Carl Whiting|last=Bishop|publisher=|via=siris-archives.si.edu Library Catalog}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dwight William Tryon]], [[Myron Bement Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siarchives&amp;uri=full=3100001~!283688~!0|title=Myron Bement Smith Collection|first=Myron Bement|last=Smith|publisher=|via=siris-archives.si.edu Library Catalog}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin March]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/archives/finding_aids/March.html|title=Benjamin March - A Finding Aid to His Papers at the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M.

Highlights of photographic holdings include the Henry and Nancy Rosin Collection of 19th century photography of Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!235035!0|title=Henry and Nancy Rosin Collection of Early Photography of Japan|first1=Henry D.|last1=Rosin|first2=Benjamin Smith|last2=Lyman|first3=Hikoma|last3=Ueno|first4=Felice|last4=Beato|first5=Nancy|last5=Rosin|first6=Raimund|last6=Stillfried|publisher=|via=siris-archives.si.edu Library Catalog}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1903-1904 photographs of the Chinese [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], and photographs of Iran by [[Antoin Sevruguin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asia.si.edu/research/archivesHighlights.asp |title=Archives: Highlights &amp;#124; Freer and Sackler Galleries |publisher=Asia.si.edu |date=2013-03-15 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Freer|Sackler Library is the largest Asian art research library in the United States. Open to the public five days a week (except federal holidays) without appointment, the library collection consists of more than 86,000 volumes, including nearly 2,000 rare books. Half the volumes are written and catalogued in Asian languages.
Originating from the collection of four thousand monographs, periodical issues, offprints, and sales catalogues that Charles Lang Freer donated to the Smithsonian Institution as part of his gift to the nation, the F|S Library maintains the highest standards for collecting materials an active program of purchases, gifts, and exchanges.

In July 1987 the library moved to its new home in the [[Arthur M. Sackler Gallery]]. Today it supports activities of both museums, such as collection development, exhibition planning, publications, and other scholarly and educational projects. Its published and unpublished resources—in the fields of Asian art and archaeology, conservation, painting, sculpture, architecture, drawings, prints, manuscripts, books, and photography—are available to museum staff, outside researchers, and the visiting public.

==Public programs==
The Eugene and Agnes E. Meyer Auditorium, named after American financier and publisher [[Eugene Meyer (financier)|Eugene Meyer]]  and journalist/social activist [[Agnes E. Meyer]], is located in the Freer and provides a venue for a broad variety of free public programs.  These programs include concerts of music and dance, lectures, chamber music, and dramatic presentations. It is also known for its film series, highlighting a wide variety of Asian cultures (including a Korean Film Festival and Iranian Film Festival).

Most recently, the museums began the series Asia After Dark, opening up the space for musicians, dancing, Asian cuisine, and other after-work adventures. The Freer and Sackler's 'We Stand With Japan' in 2011 hosted [[Steve Aoki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/freersackler/5727778640/in/pool-asiaafterdark/ |title=Asia After Dark - Freer Gallery of Art - We Stand with Japan &amp;#124; Flickr - Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date=2011-05-14 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free drop-in tours are available daily and guide visitors through both featured exhibitions and specific themes in both the Freer and Sackler galleries, and a wide range of public lectures provide in-depth experiences with prominent artists and scholars.

==Conservation==
Care of the collections began before the museum came into existence as Charles Lang Freer, the founder of the Freer Gallery of Art, hired Japanese painting restorers to care for his works and to prepare them for their eventual home as part of the Smithsonian Institution. In 1932, the Freer Gallery of Art hired a full-time Japanese restorer and established what was to become the East Asian Painting Conservation Studio. This facility remains one of the few in the United States that specializes in the conservation of Asian paintings.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian Institution Archives"/&gt; The Technical Laboratory was established in 1951 when chemist Rutherford J. Gettens moved from the [[Fogg Museum]] at [[Harvard University]] to the Freer. The laboratory was the first Smithsonian facility devoted to the use of scientific methods for the study of works of art. Over the years, the work of the Technical Laboratory expanded to include objects, paper, and exhibits conservation. The Technical Laboratory and the East Asian Painting Conservation Studio merged in 1990 to create the Department of Conservation and Scientific Research for both the Freer and Sackler Galleries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asia.si.edu/visitor/conservation.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202110608/http://www.asia.si.edu/visitor/conservation.htm |date=February 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservators in the Department of Conservation and Scientific Research care for and treat works of art in the collection and prepare them for exhibition. The department works to ensure long-term preservation and storage, safe handling, exhibition, and transport of artworks in the permanent collection, as well as those on loan. In addition, conservators are responsible for conducting technical examinations of objects already in the collection and those under consideration for acquisition. They also collaborate frequently with the department's scientists on technical and applied research. Training and professional outreach efforts are an integral part of the department's commitment to educating future conservators, museum professionals, and the public about conservation.

==Scholarship==
The Freer has had a long tradition in serving as a center for inquiry and advanced scholarship about Asia.  The Freer not only presents a lectures and symposia to the public, it also copublishes the ''Ars Orientalis'' with the [[University of Michigan]] Department of History of Art. ''Ars Orientalis'' is a peer-reviewed annual volume of scholarly articles and occasional reviews of books on the art and archaeology of Asia, the ancient Near East, and the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/research/ArsOrientalis.asp |title=Ars Orientalis Freer and Sackler Galleries |publisher=Asia.si.edu |date=2013-03-15 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Freer and Sackler, along with the Metropolitan Center for Far Eastern Art Studies in Kyoto, Japan, presents the Shimada Prize for distinguished scholarship in the history of East Asian art.  The award was established in 1992 in honor of Professor Shimada Shujiro, by the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery and by The Metropolitan Center for Far Eastern Art Studies in Kyoto, Japan.  Several fellowships are also available to support graduate students and visiting scholars, including the [[Andrew W. Mellon]] Fellowship, Anne Van Biema Fellowship (Japanese Visual Arts), Iran Heritage Foundation (IHF) Fellowship (Persian art), Lunder Fellowship, J. S. Lee Memorial Fellowship (Chinese Art), Smithsonian Institution Fellowship, and the Freer Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/research/fellowships.asp |title=Fellowships &amp; Internships &amp;#124; Research &amp;#124; Freer and Sackler Galleries |publisher=Asia.si.edu |date=2013-03-15 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freer and Sackler curators are also involved in dozens of ongoing research projects, often with colleagues from institutions around the world. The results of their work can be seen in a variety of published formats, including exhibition catalogues, scholarly publications, and online publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/research/curatorial/default.asp |title=Curatorial Research &amp;#124; Freer and Sackler Galleries |publisher=Asia.si.edu |date=2013-03-15 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charleston version==
[[File:Washington at the City of Charleston by John Trumbull.jpg|thumb|right|''Washington at the City of Charleston'', by John Trumbull, 1792]]
After Smith rejected the painting, Trumbull painted a similar, but different version for the city, entitled ''Washington at the City of Charleston''. It was now set at Charleston, with the city in the background, the [[Cooper River (South Carolina)|Cooper River]] and boats in the middle ground, and local plants in the foreground. Washington is shown as Smith wanted, "calm, tranquil, peaceful."

==Other versions==
Trumbull painted a much smaller version ({{convert|26+1//2|in|cm}} x {{convert|18+1//2|in|cm}}), entitled ''George Washington before the Battle of Trenton'', {{circa|1792}}–94, likely for his friend Charles Wilkes, a New York banker.

Trumbull described the thinking of Washington after seeing the superiority of the enemy at Trenton: {{quote|... he is supposed to have been meditating how to avoid the apparently impending ruin. To re-cross the Delaware in the presence of such an enemy, was impossible; to retreat down the eastern side of the river, and cross at Philadelphia, was equally so; to hazard a battle on the ground, was desperate.&lt;ref name=trumbull/&gt;}} Historian and painter [[William Dunlap]] after viewing it in the Trumbull Gallery at Yale said: "This is, in many respects, a fine picture, and painted in the artist's best days."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunlap|first1=William|author-link=William Dunlap|title=A History of the Rise and Progress of the Arts of Design in the United States|date=1918|page=76|volume=2|url=https://archive.org/stream/ahistoryriseand01dunlgoog#page/n100/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism small}}
Over the millennia of its development [[Hinduism]] has adopted several [[iconography|iconic symbols]], forming part of  '''Hindu iconography''', that are imbued with spiritual meaning based on either the [[Hindu scriptures|scriptures]] or cultural traditions. The exact significance accorded to any of the icons varies with region, period and denomination of the followers. Over time some of the symbols, for instance the [[Swastika]] has come to have wider association while others like [[Om|Aum]] are recognized as unique representations of Hinduism. Other aspects of Hindu iconography are covered by the terms [[murti]], for icons and [[mudra]] for gestures and positions of the hands and body.

== Hindu Sacraments  ==
Hindu sacraments are physical objects or markings that are considered sacred and used as a sign of devotion by the followers of Sanathana dharma (Hinduism). These are often objects associated with a [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]] (prayer) or religious ceremony.
[[File:জী. ডি. ব্লক সল্টলেক দূর্গা পুজো ২০১৮.jpg|thumb|right|Goddess [[Durga]] and a pantheon of other gods and goddesses being worshipped during [[Durga Puja]] Festival in Kolkata. This image was taken in Block - G.D, Saltlake Durga Puja 2018 in North Kolkata.]]

=== Tilaka ===
The ''[[tilaka]]'' (or ''tilak'') is a mark worn on the forehead or other parts of the body as a sign of  spiritual devotion. Hindus may wear a tilaka regularly or especially on religious occasions. The shape of the ''tilaka'' is often an indicator of devotion to a certain deity. For example, a [[Vaishnavism#Vaishnava tilak|'U' shape tilaka]] usually denotes devotion to [[Vishnu]], while [[Shiva]] devotees often wear it in the form of three horizontal lines. It may be made of [[saffron]], [[vermilion]], [[turmeric]], [[clay]] or simply ash.

To denote marriage and auspiciousness, married Hindu women commonly wear a decorative vermilion dot or bindu, or ''[[bindi (decoration)|bindī]]'' on the forehead. This is analogous to a [[wedding ring]] worn in western countries. In southern India, the mark is called pottu (or bottu). The exact shape, size and location of the bindi or pottu shows regional variation; for instance, in northern India the bindi is often worn just below the hairline, while in southern India it is more common to wear it between the eyebrows. In east India, especially in [[West Bengal]], traditionally larger ''bindis'' are worn as mark of  devotion towards Goddess [[Durga]].

=== Vibhuti ===
[[Vibhuti]] is the holy ash obtained from sacred [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]] rites involving fire. Also a variant called Basma used as Vibhuti is prepared from the purified ashes of cow dung. Ash as the product of fire is considered intrinsically pure{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}. It is used on the forehead, normally as three horizontal lines representing [[Shiva]]. Some Hindus meld both the three horizontal vibhuti lines of Shiva and the 'U' shape thilaka of Vishnu in an amalgam marker signifying ''[[Harihara|Hari-Hara]]'' (Vishnu-Shiva). In addition, sacred ash signifies that the body's origin is from dust and ash and to dust and ash it shall return. The ash is a marker of impermanence. Everything in the interim is but an illusion (''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'').

Vibhuti, when applied to the forehead, also symbolizes the '''willingness''' to destroy negative thoughts and qualities (jealousy, envy, anger, greed, etc.), as these negative qualities, if not destroyed, will bring all kinds of pains in life.

=== Rudraksha ===
[[Rudraksha]] are seeds of the [[Elaeocarpus ganitrus|rudraksha tree]] that, in [[Hinduism]], represent the tears of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] (also known as, [[Rudra]]). They are often threaded into a necklace and used as a [[rosary]] to accompany prayer and meditation.

== Universal symbols ==
Among the most revered symbols in Hinduism, three are a quintessential part of its culture, and are most representative of its general ethos:

=== Om (pronounced Aum) ===
{{main article|Om}}
''[[Om]]'' (or Aum, '''ॐ''') is the sacred [[sound symbol]] that represents Universe; the ultimate reality ([[Brahman]]). It is prefixed and sometimes suffixed to all Vedic [[mantra]]s and prayers. Aum is often said to represent God in the three aspects of  Brahman (A),  Vishnu (U) and Shiva (M). As the Divine primordial vibration, it represents the one ultimate reality, underlying and encompassing all of nature and all of existence.  The written syllable  '''ॐ''' called [[Om|omkara]] serves as a deeply significant and distinctly recognizable symbol for Hindu dharma. The pronunciation of Aum moves through all possible human [[natural language|linguistic]] [[vowel]] sounds and is different from the pronunciation of Om.  Both are often symbolically equated, although they are [[sound|sonic]]ally distinct.

=== Swastika ===
''[[Swastika|{{IAST|Swastika}}]]''  is a symbol connoting general auspiciousness.  It may represent purity of soul, truth, and stability  or, alternatively, [[Surya]], the sun.&lt;ref name="karelwerner1"&gt;Karel Werner, A Popular Dictionary of Hinduism 147-48 (Curzon Press 1994) {{ISBN|0-7007-0279-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its rotation in four directions has been used to represent many ideas, but primarily describes the four directions, the four Vedas and their harmonious whole. Its use in Hinduism dates back to ancient times.

=== Sri Chakra Yantra ===
''[[Sri Chakra]]''  Yantra of [[Tripura Sundari]] (commonly referred to as Sri Yantra) is a [[mandala]] formed by nine interlocking triangles.  Four of these triangles are oriented upright, representing [[Shiva]] or the Masculine.  Five of these triangles are inverted triangles representing  [[Shakti]], or the Feminine.  Together, the nine triangles form a web symbolic of the entire cosmos, a womb symbolic of creation, and together express [[Advaita Vedanta]] or [[non-duality]].  All other yantras are derivatives of this supreme yantra.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Symbols associated with individual deities==
[[File:Ravi Varma-Lakshmi.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Goddess [[Lakshmi]] holding and standing on a lotus.]]
Several symbols (animals, flora, instruments, weapons, or even color) in Hindu iconography are associated with particular [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]], and vice versa. In certain cases the deities themselves are personifications of natural forces, for instance [[Agni]] (fire), [[Vayu]] (wind), [[Surya]] (Sun) and [[Prithvi]] (Earth). In other instances, the associations arise from specific incidents or characteristics related in [[Hindu theology]]. The iconography serve to identify the particular deity in their pictorial or sculptural representations. The symbolism also often links the deities with a particular natural or human attribute, or profession.

It is important to understand the symbolism, in order to appreciate the allegorical references in not only Hindu scriptures (for instance, [[Puranas|Puranic tales]]), but also in both ancient and modern secular works of authors from the Indian subcontinent. The art and science of designing temples includes the study of sculpture and the ornamentation of religious significance as described in [[Religious text|sacred texts]] (shilpa shaastra aagamas). In [[History of India|Ancient India]] twelve years of theoretical and practical training used to be given to the student by an able experienced teacher.

=== Shiva Lingam ===
[[File:Shivalinga Nutan Dal Arnab Dutta 2010.JPG|thumb|right|[[Shiva Lingam]]]]
The [[Lingam|Shiva Lingam]] represents the divine being [[Shiva]], and is used as a symbol of the power of fertility and strength {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}. Shivalinga (Sivalinga) is the most important and a popular symbolic representation of Lord Shiva (Siva) in Hinduism. It represents God Himself in His all the three aspects – Creator, Sustainer or Protector and Destroyer (Dissolutor).&lt;ref name="Harshananda, Swami p.7"&gt;Harshananda, Swami, ''Principal Symbols of World Religions'', Sri Ramakrishna Math, Mylapore, Chennai, - 600 004 ({{ISBN|81-7120-176-8}})  p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

====Meaning====
The word ‘Shivalinga’ is a combination of the words ‘Shiva’ (auspiciousness) and linga (sign or symbol). Thus ‘Shivalinga’ is a representation of God in His all-auspicious aspect. Again ‘Shiva’ also means ‘One in Whom all creation sleeps after dissolution’. ‘Linga’ also means the place of dissolution of the disintegrated universe.&lt;ref name="Harshananda, Swami p.7"/&gt;
The Shiva linga represents the supreme creator, the cause behind the creation, protection, and destruction of everything visible and invisible and the god shiva.

====TYPES====
Based on the mobility of the object of worship, Shivalingas are broadly divided into two categories – ‘Cala’ and ‘Acala’&lt;ref name="Harshananda, Swami p.8"&gt;Harshananda, Swami, ''Principal Symbols of World Religions'', Sri Ramakrishna Math, Mylapore, Chennai, - 600 004 ({{ISBN|81-7120-176-8}})  p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cala Shivalingas=====
These are made of stone, crystal, metals, clay, rice, dough, etc. These can be moved from one place to another.&lt;ref name="Harshananda, Swami p.8"/&gt;

=====Acala  Shivalingas=====
The sacred texts describe many types of shiva linga based on variations in the proportions. The following is the description of sarvatobhadra shiva lingam preferably constructed in black spotless hard stone which can be worshiped by every living being.
These Shivlingas are  installed in temples and are fixed to ground or a base. They are usually made of stones or metals.
The sacred texts suggest that the shiva linga must have three parts. A bottom most 1/3rd part that is in the earth - '''Brahma bhaagam''' (represents Brahma, the Creator of the World) it is rectangular in cross section.&lt;ref name="Harshananda, Swami p.8"/&gt; 
A middle 1/3rd part is called '''Vishnu Bhaagam''' or Vishnu Bhaga (it represents Vishnu, the Protector and sustainer of the world ); it is octagonal in cross section. Both the Brahma bhaagam and Vishnu Bhaagam are embedded in peetham (the ornamental pedestal).&lt;ref name="Harshananda, Swami p.9"&gt;Harshananda, Swami, ''Principal Symbols of World Religions'', Sri Ramakrishna Math, Mylapore, Chennai, - 600 004 ({{ISBN|81-7120-176-8}})  p.9&lt;/ref&gt; 
A visible 1/3rd '''Shiva Pooja bhaagam''' or Pooja bhaga( also known as Rudra  bhaagam or Rudra  bhaga) which is top most part which is worshiped. It is circular in cross section and cylindrical in shape. It represents Rudra (Shiva), the Dissoluter or Destroyer of the World. It is known as Pooja bhaagam because this part is worshipped.&lt;ref name="Harshananda, Swami p.9"/&gt; 
'''Brahmasutras''':
These are certain essential lines present on the Rudra  bhaagam (Rudra  bhaga). Without them a Shivlinga is unfit to be worshipped.&lt;ref name="Harshananda, Swami p.9"/&gt; 
The Shiva linga is at the level of ground and easily accessible to the worshipers irrespective of their caste, social or economic status.


[[File:Lingaico.png]]

=== The Lotus ===
The [[Nelumbo nucifera#Religious symbolism|Lotus]] is associated with the [[creation theology]] as well as the gods [[Vishnu]], [[Brahma]], and [[Lakshmi]].
It is the symbol of beauty and fertility. "In the [[Bhagavad Gita]], a human is adjured to be like the lotus; they should work without attachment, dedicating their actions to [[God]], untouched by [[sin]] like water on a lotus leaf, like a beautiful flower standing high above the mud and water." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lotussculpture.com/my_articles_lotus.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Veena ===
The musical instrument [[Veena]] is associated with the Hindu goddess [[Saraswati]] and the sage [[Narada]]. It represents arts and learning.

=== Conch ===
[[File:Hindu priest blowing conch during punja.jpg|thumb|A Hindu pundit (priest) blowing the conch during [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]].]]
{{Main article|Shankha}}
The conch shell is a major Hindu article of [[prayer]], used as a trumpeting announcement of all sorts. The God of Preservation, [[Vishnu]], is said to hold a special conch, Panchajanya, that represents life as it has come out of life-giving waters. In the story of Dhruva the divine conch plays a special part. The warriors of ancient [[India]] would blow conch shells to announce battle, such as is famously represented in the beginning of the war of Kurukshetra in the [[Mahabharata]], a famous Hindu epic. The conch shell is also a deep part of Hindu symbolic and religious tradition. Today most Hindus use the conch as a part of their religious practices, blowing it during worship at specific points, accompanied by ceremonial bells. Shankha also symbolizes the sound that created the universe and stands for knowledge.

=== Chakra ===
The [[Sudarshana Chakra|Chakra]] or disc-like weapon of [[Vishnu]] is often found mounted on the top of [[Vaishnava]] temples or incorporated into architectural designs. Images depicting Vishnu's four-armed [[Narayana]] form almost always include the Chakra in one of his hands. It is a general symbol for protection. Chakra is also known to symbolize the need to follow dharma and to condemn adharma.

=== Multiple heads and arms ===
[[File:Indian-dance-multiple-arms.jpg|thumb|In [[Dance in India|Indian dance]], the idea of multiple arms is often shown by several dancers standing behind each other with their arms in different positions.]] {{expand section|date=July 2011}}
An array of Hindu, Buddhist, and some Jain deities are often depicted with multiple heads, arms, and other body parts, creating what one author refers to as a "multiplicity convention" in religious iconography.&lt;ref name="manyarms"&gt;Srinivasan, Doris Meth, Many Heads, Arms, and Eyes: Origin, Meaning, and Form of Multiplicity in Indian Art, in ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', 121(2):279-280, 2001, {{OCLC|208705592}}; as a book by the same title: Leiden, New York, Brill, 1997, {{ISBN|978-9004107588}}, at pp. 3-4, et seq.., with preview available at [https://books.google.com/books?id=vZheP9dIX9wC Google books].&lt;/ref&gt; Such multiple body parts represent the divine [[omnipresence]] and [[immanence]] (ability to be in many places at once and simultaneously exist in all places at once), and thereby the ability to influence many things at once.&lt;ref name="manyarms" /&gt; The specific meanings attributed to the multiple body parts of an image are symbolic, not literal in context.&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; In such depictions, the visual effect of an array of multiple arms is to create a kinetic energy showing that ability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/view?exhibitionId=%7b7EA7152E-99D7-45D4-A5F1-0BC1BC8CC8A8%7d&amp;oid=60005542&amp;pg=1&amp;rpp=20&amp;pos=19&amp;ft=* The Goddess Durga Killing the Buffalo Demon (Mahishasura Mardini)], The Metropolitan Museum of Art, metmuseum.org, 2012 (last update). Accessed 2012-7-5. The Met notes that with sculptural depictions of multiple-armed deities viewed by the flicker of oil lamps in a dimly lit shrine, the visual kinetic energy of their many arms are no doubt made the more powerful to the viewer by the movement of light upon the sculpture.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vāhana ===
{{main article|Vāhana}}
Vāhana or vehicle, sometimes called a mount, is an animal or mythical entity closely associated with a particular deity in Hindu theology. Sometimes the deity is iconographically depicted riding and/or mounted on the vahana; other times, the vahana is depicted at the deity's side or symbolically represented as a divine attribute.

===Vishnu===
Vishnu is the Protector-God. Of the three gods of the Hindu Triad, Vishnu, being the Preserver, appears most human.
The Rig Vedic Vishnu is conceived as the sun in three stages - rising, zenith and setting. The Vedic Vishnu strides through the heavens in three steps. This is Vishnu's great deed and constitutes his great glory. With these three steps Vishnu, a solar deity, courses through the three divisions of the universe, "the god being manifest in a threefold form, as Agni on earth, Indra or Vayu in the atmosphere and Surya in the sky". He is said to have taken these three steps for the preservation and benefit of mortals. The zenith is appropriately called Vishnu's place. His third step cannot be seen with human eyes. It is here that Indra dwells.

'''''I Am Curious (Yellow)''''' ({{Lang-sv|'''Jag är nyfiken – en film i gult'''}}, meaning "I Am Curious: A Film in Yellow") is a 1967 Swedish [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Vilgot Sjöman]], starring Sjöman and [[Lena Nyman]]. It is a companion film to 1968's ''[[I Am Curious (Blue)]]''; the two were initially intended to be one {{frac|3|1|2}} hour film.&lt;ref&gt;Vilgot Sjöman, ''I Was Curious: Diary of the Making of a Film'' ([[Grove Press]], 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==

Director [[Vilgot Sjöman]] plans to make a social film starring his lover [[Lena Nyman]], a young theater student who has a strong interest in social issues.

Nyman's character, also named Lena, lives with her father in a small apartment in [[Stockholm]] and is driven by a burning passion for [[social justice]] and a need to understand the world, people and relationships. Her little room is filled with books, papers, and boxes full of clippings on topics such as "religion" and "men", and files on each of the 23 men with whom she has had sex. The walls are covered with pictures of [[concentration camp]]s and a portrait of [[Francisco Franco]], reminders of the crimes being perpetrated against humanity. She walks around Stockholm and interviews people about social classes in society, conscientious objection, gender equality, and the morality of vacationing in Franco's Spain. She and her friends also picket embassies and travel agencies. Lena's relationship with her father, who briefly went to Spain to fight Franco, is problematic, and she is distressed by the fact that he returned from Spain for unknown reasons after only a short period.

Through her father Lena meets the slick Bill (Börje in the original Swedish), who works at a menswear shop and voted for the Rightist Party. They begin a love affair, but Lena soon finds out from her father that Bill has another woman, Marie, and a young daughter. Lena is furious that Bill has not been open with her, and goes to the country on a bicycle holiday. Alone in a cabin in the woods, she attempts an ascetic lifestyle, meditating, studying [[nonviolence]] and practicing [[yoga]]. Bill soon comes looking for her in his new car. She greets him with a shotgun, but they soon start to make love. Lena confronts Bill about Marie, and finds out about another of his lovers, Madeleine. They begin to fight and Bill leaves. Lena has strange dreams, in which she ties two teams of soccer players – she notes that they number 23 – to a tree, shoots Bill and cuts his penis off. She also dreams of being taunted by passing drivers as she cycles down a road, until finally [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] drives up. She apologizes to him for not being strong enough to practice nonviolence.

Lena returns home, destroys her room, and goes to the car showroom where Bill works to tell him she has [[scabies]]. They are treated at a clinic, and then go their separate ways. As the embedded story of Lena and Bill begins to resolve, the film crew and director Sjöman are featured more. The relationship between Lena the actress and Bill the actor has become intimate during the production of Vilgot's film, and Vilgot is jealous and clashes with Bill. The film concludes with Lena returning Vilgot's keys as he meets with another young female theater student.

=== Nonfictional content === 
The film also includes an interview with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., filmed in March 1966, when King was visiting Stockholm along with [[Harry Belafonte]] with a view to starting a new initiative for Swedish support of African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Sjöman, published screenplay (Grove Press, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; The film also includes an interview with Minister of Transportation [[Olof Palme]], who talks about the existence of class structure in Swedish society (he was told it was for a documentary film), and footage of Russian poet [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]].

===Censorship===
The film includes numerous and frank scenes of [[nudity]] and staged [[sexual intercourse]]. One particularly controversial scene features Lena kissing her lover's flaccid [[human penis|penis]]. In 1969, the film was banned in [[Massachusetts]] for being [[Pornography|pornographic]] and Boston police seized the film reels for ''I Am Curious (Yellow)'' from the Symphony Cinemas. After proceedings in the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts]] (''Karalexis v. Byrne'', 306 F. Supp. 1363 (D. Mass. 1969)), the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]], and the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] (''Byrne v. Karalexis'', [http://supreme.justia.com/us/396/976/case.html 396 U.S. 976 (1969)] and [http://supreme.justia.com/us/401/216/case.html 401 U.S. 216 (1971)]), the Second Circuit found the film not to be obscene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmint.nu/?q=node/31 I Am Curious / Jag är nyfiken | Film International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitebloom|first1=Kenny|title=The Curious Case of 'I am Curious'|url=http://bostonlocaltv.org/blog/2011/08/the-curious-case-of-i-am-curious/|website=Boston TV News Digital Library|accessdate=22 January 2015|date=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
The film was very popular at the box office, earning an estimated $6.6 million in North American rentals.&lt;ref&gt;"Big Rental Films of 1969", ''Variety'', 7 January 1970, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the 12th most popular film in the US in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;"The World's Top Twenty Films". ''Sunday Times'' (London, England) 27 September 1970: 27. The Sunday Times Digital Archive. accessed 5 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; One reason it did so well was that it became popular among film stars to be seen going to the film. News of Johnny Carson seeing the film legitimized going to see it despite any misgivings about possible pornographic content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Blood|first=Kirk L.|year=2016|title=My 1st Wife Had a Borderline Personality Disorder|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|isbn= 978-1-329-90421-7|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
====Contemporary====
Initial reception to Curious Yellow was divided. [[Vincent Canby]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' referred to it as a "Good, serious movie about a society in transition,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By VINCENT CANBYMARCH 11, 1969 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B06E0DC1039E63ABC4952DFB5668382679EDE |title=Screen: 'I Am Curious (Yellow)' From Sweden - The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1969-03-11 |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Norman Mailer]] said he felt "like a better man" after having seen it. Conversely, [[Rex Reed]] described the film as "about as good for you as drinking furniture polish" and [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' lambasted it as "a dog... a real dog" and "stupid and slow and uninteresting.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/i-am-curious-yellow-1969|title=I Am Curious (Yellow) Movie Review (1969) - Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=www.rogerebert.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Retrospective====
In recent years, Yellow has received some reappraisal, thanks in part to [[Gary Giddins]], who authored the 2003 essay accompanying the Criterion Collection DVD release, and a review by Nathan Southern on the [[All Movie Guide]] website. Southern assesses the picture as "a droll and sophisticated comedy about the emotional, political, social, and sexual liberation of a young woman... a real original that has suffered from public incomprehension since its release and is crying out for reassessment and rediscovery.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/i-am-curious-yellow-v24002/review|title=I Am Curious (Yellow) (1967) - Vilgot Sjöman - Review - AllMovie|website=AllMovie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2015,  "I Am Curious (Yellow)" received a 52% rating based on 25 reviews, 13 "fresh" and 12 "rotten" on the review aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

'''Joseph Pohl''' (1864&amp;ndash;1939) was a [[Germans|German]] [[botanical artist]] born in [[Breslau]] (now Wrocław, [[Poland]]).

Apprenticed as an [[engraver]], Pohl collaborated with [[botanist]] [[Adolf Engler]] (1844–1930) for over forty years on several of Engler's important works. Pohl's work is acclaimed for its accuracy and not its artistic quality. His illustrations are considered especially valuable due to destruction of many of the actual plants midst the bombing of the [[Berlin]] [[herbarium]] during [[World War II]]. The following are a list of Engler's major publications that Pohl provided illustrations for:
* ''Die natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien'' (1887–1909)
* ''Das Pflanzenreich'' (1900 et seq.)
* ''Die Pflanzenwelt Afrikas'' (1908–10)
* ''Monographien afrikanischer Pflanzenfamilien'' (1898–1904)
He also provided most of the illustrations for the journal ''Engler's Botanische Jahrbücher'', and created [[orchid]] illustrations for [[Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius]]' ''[[Flora Brasiliensis]]''. Engler named the botanical genus ''Pohliella'' from the family [[Podostemaceae]] in Pohl's honor.

'''Mosaic of Kelenderis''' ({{lang-tr|Aydıncık Mozayiği}}) is a Medieval age floor mosaic in Mersin Province, [[Turkey]].

==Geography==
The mosaic is in the urban fabric of  [[Aydıncık, Mersin|Aydıncık]] [[ilçe]] (district) of [[Mersin Province]] at {{coord|36|08|36|N|33|19|24|E}}. It is slightly to the west of the ancient harbor in a place locally known as ''Hanyıkığı''. Its distance to [[Mersin]] is {{convert|160|km}}.

==The mosaic==
The mosaic was unearthed by Professor Levent Zoroğlu of [[Selçuk University]] and his team in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aydincik33.meb.gov.tr/www/aydincik-tarihcesi/icerik/140 Ministry of Education Aydıncık branch {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The dimensions of the floor mosaic is 12 x 3.2 square meters (40 x 11 square feet). On the mosaic, the medieval harbor, two vessels and a part of the city were depicted. A part of the mosaic has been decorated with geometric figures. Professor Zoroğlu estimates that the mosaic had been created in the fifth and sixth centuries, i.e., early [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era.

Probably the image displayed on the mosaic was a kind of city guide for the visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aktuelarkeoloji.com.tr/?/=1347 Archaeology page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the mosaic was put under a displaycase.

'''Roofing material''' is the outermost layer on the [[roof]] of a building, sometimes self-supporting, but generally supported by an underlying structure. A building's roofing material provides shelter from the natural elements. The outer layer of a roof shows great variation dependent upon availability of material, and the nature of the supporting structure. Those types of roofing material which are commercially available range from natural products such as [[thatch]] and [[slate]] to commercially produced products such as [[tiles]] and [[polycarbonate]] sheeting. Roofing materials may be placed on top of a secondary water-resistant material called underlayment.

==Materials==
The weatherproofing material is the topmost or outermost layer exposed to the weather.  Many materials have been used as weatherproofing material:
* [[Thatch]] is roofing made of plant stalks in overlapping layers
** [[Wheat]] [[straw]], widely used in England, France, and other parts of Europe
**[[Seagrass]], used in coastal areas where there are [[estuary|estuaries]] such as Scotland. Has a longer life than straw. Claimed to have a life in excess of 60 years.
** [[Rye]] straw, commonly used in a barn.
** Raffia palm leaves:A well organised raffia palm leaves is mainly used as roof houses in Nigeria, especially among the Igbos.
** [[Rice]] straw, commonly used in Eastern Asia.
** Water reed, commonly used in Ireland for [[Thatching]].
* [[Roof shingle|Shingle]] is the generic term for a roofing material that is in many overlapping sections, 
** [[Wood shingle]], shingles sawn from bolts of wood such as [[Thuja plicata|red cedar]] which has a useful performance life expectancy of up to 30 years. However, young growth red cedar has a short life expectancy and high cost. In the United States and Canada, eastern [[Thuja occidentalis|white cedar]] is also used. Some [[hardwood]]s were very durable roofing found in Colonial [[Australian architecture|Australian]] and [[American colonial architecture]]; their use is now usually limited to [[building restoration]]. All wood shingles benefit by being allowed to breathe (dry out from below).
** [[Shake (shingle)]], Are different than wood shingles in that they are split on one side and sawed on the back side. Commonly referred to as "resawn Shakes". A cedar shake is NOT the same as a cedar shingle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Grading and Manufacturing {{!}} Products {{!}} Cedar Shake and Shingle Bureau|url = http://www.cedarbureau.org/frequently-asked-questions/product/grading-and-manufacturing.asp|website = www.cedarbureau.org|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Slate]]. High cost with a life expectancy of 80 to 400 years. See the article [[slate industry]] for an overview including names of quarries. Some of the famous quarries where the highest quality slate comes from that are available in Australia are Bethesda in Wales and areas of Spain.
** [[Asphalt shingle]] made of bitumen embedded in an organic or fiberglass mat, usually covered with colored, man-made ceramic grit. Cheaper than slate or tiles. The reduced cost of this particular style of roofing is especially apparent in its application and removal. Installation is very streamlined and a rapid process. Depending on the size of the roof and the experience of the crew, it is possible to remove old shingles and apply new ones on 2-3 houses in one day. Life span varies. Use only on slanted roofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roofing Requirements One- and Two- Family Dwellings|url=http://roofingroger.com/roofing-requirements-one-and-two-family-dwellings/|publisher=Regulatory Services Department|accessdate=29 August 2015|quote=Asphalt-based organic and fiberglass shingles may only be used on roofs with slopes of 2:12 and greater.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Rubber shingle, alternative to asphalt shingle, slate, shake or tile. Made primarily of rubber, often recycled tire-derived rubber. Other typical ingredients include binders, UV (ultraviolet light) inhibitors and color. Warranted and designed to last at least 50 years in most cases.
** [[Asbestos]] shingles. Very long lifespan, fireproof, and low cost but now rarely used because of health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/BHCV2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Asbestos_and_your_health?open | title=Asbestos and your health | publisher=[[State Government of Victoria]] | work=Better Health Channel | date=September 2011 | accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Stone slab. Heavy stone slabs (not to be confused with slate) 1–2 inches thick were formerly used as roofing tiles in some regions in England, the [[Alps]], and [[Scandinavia]]. Stone slabs require a very heavyweight roof structure, but their weight makes them stormproof. An obsolete roofing material, now used commercially only for building restoration.
*** [[Collyweston stone slate]]
** [[Solar shingle]]
** Metal shakes or shingles. Long life. High cost, suitable for roofs of 3:12 pitch or greater. Because of the flexibility of metal, they can be manufactured to lock together, giving durability and reducing assembly time. For a discussion of copper system shingles, see [[Copper in architecture#Wall cladding]].
* Ceramic [[tile#Roof tiles|tile]]. High cost, life of more than 100 years.
** [[Imbrex and tegula]], style dating back to ancient Greece and Rome.
** [[Monk and Nun]], a style similar to Imbrex and tegula, but basically using two Imbrex tiles.
** [[Dutch roof tiles]], Netherlands
** [[Mangalore tiles]], India
* [[Membrane roofing]]. Membrane roofing is in large sheets, generally fused in some way at the joints to form a continuous surface.
** [[Thermoset membrane]] (e.g. [[EPDM rubber]]). [[Synthetic rubber]] sheets adhered together with contact adhesive or tape. Primary application is big box stores with large open areas.
** [[Thermoplastic]]s (e.g. [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[ThermoPlastic Olefin|TPO]], [[Hypalon|CSPE]]) – Plastic sheets welded together with hot air, creating one continuous sheet membrane. They can be re-welded with the exception of CSPE. Lends itself well to both big box and small roof application because of its hot air weldability. This membrane is installed by two methods: 1.) Rolls of membrane are attached to the ridged insulation using a bonding adhesive; 2.) The edge of each roll is fastened through ridged insulation into structural deck, and the proceeding roll is lapped over the fasteners.  The overlap is then heat-welded with hot air to create a mechanically fastened thermoplastic roof. PVC is also known as IB.[[Vinyl roof membrane]].
** [[Liquid roofing]]
** [[Asphalt roll roofing]] including single and double coverage types.
** [[Bituminous waterproofing]] is a general term for:
*** Modified [[bitumen]] – heat-welded, asphalt-adhered, or installed with adhesive. Asphalt is mixed with polymers such as APP or SBS, then applied to fiberglass and/or polyester mat, seams sealed by locally melting the asphalt with heat, hot mopping of asphalt, or adhesive.  Lends itself well to most applications.
*** Built-up roof – Multiple plies of salt-saturated organic felt or coated fiberglass felts. Plies of felt are adhered with hot asphalt, coal tar pitch, or adhesive.  Although the roof membrane can be left bare, it is typically covered with a thick coat of the waterproofing material and covered with gravel.  The gravel provides protection from ultra-violet degradation, stabilizes the temperature changes, protects surface of the roof, and increases the weight of the roof system to resist wind blow-off.
**[[Textile|Fabric]]
** [[polyester]].
** [[PTFE]], (synthetic fluoropolymer) embedded in [[fibreglass]].
* [[Metal roof]]ing.
** [[Corrugated galvanised iron]] is [[Hot-dip galvanizing|Galvanised steel]] manufactured with wavy corrugations to resist lateral flexing and fitted with exposed fasteners. Widely used for low cost and durability. Sheds are normally roofed with this material. ''Gal iron'' or ''Corro'' was the most extensively used roofing material of 20th century Australia, now replaced in popularity by steel with longer-lasting, coloured, alloy coatings.
** [[Copper in architecture#Roofing|Copper roofs]] can last for hundreds of years. Copper roofing offers durability, ease of fabrication, lighter weight than some other roofing materials, can be curved, low maintenance, corrosion resistance, low thermal movement, lightning protection, radio frequency shielding, and are 100% recyclable. Copper roofs have a high initial cost but very long lifetime: tests on European copper roofs from the 18th Century showed that, in theory, copper roofs can last one thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;The glory of copper; ''Metal Roofing Magazine,'' December 2002/January 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Another advantage of copper roofing systems is that they are relatively easy to repair.
** Standing-seam metal with concealed fasteners.
** Mechanically seamed metal with concealed fasteners contains sealant in seams for use on very low sloped roofs, suitable for roofs of low pitch such as 0.5/12 to 3/12 pitch.
** Flat-seam metal with or without soldered seams.
** [[Steel]] coated with a coloured [[alloy]] of [[zinc]] and [[aluminium]].
** [[Stone-coated metal roofing]].
* [[Concrete]] or [[fibre cement]], usually reinforced with fibres of some sort.
** may also be in the form of concrete tiles.
* Structural concrete can also be used for flat roof constructions. There are three main categories, [[Prestressed concrete|precast/prestressed]], cast-in-place and [[Concrete shell|shell]]. There are many types of precast/prestressed concrete roofing. The following are the most common types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Concrete Roof Systems Part 1: Precast/Prestressed Constructions |url=http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Concrete%20Roof%20Systems%20Part%20I_%20Precast_Prestressed%20Construction_tcm45-348518.pdf |accessdate=26 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526171509/http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Concrete%20Roof%20Systems%20Part%20I_%20Precast_Prestressed%20Construction_tcm45-348518.pdf |archivedate=26 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Double tee]]s are the most common products for short spans up to {{Convert|60|ft}}
** [[Hollow-core slab]]s are used when there is a need for flushed ceiling.
** [[T-beam]]s are similar to double tees but can be used for span ranging from {{Convert|30|ft}} to {{Convert|100|ft}}.
** [[Joist]]s and [[Concrete slab|planks]] are combination of using prestressed joists with prestressed planks. [[Keystone (architecture)|Keystone]]-shape joists can be used for up to {{Convert|36|ft|adj=on}} spans and tee-shape joists can be used for up to {{Convert|60|ft|adj=on}} span.

==Other components==

===Underlayments===
* [[Tar paper]] and [[felt paper]]
* Synthetic underlayment
* Ice and water shield
* Insolation(Dens deck)
* Fire Sheet

===Drip edge===
* Drip edge is a metal  installed to the edges of a roof deck, after the roofing material is installed. The metal may be galvanized, steel, aluminum, charcoal, white (painted or not), copper and possibly others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7611">'''Margrét Þóra (Thora) Hallgrímsson''' (born 28 January 1930) is the wife of the businessman [[Björgólfur Guðmundsson]] and like him was a prominent figure in the cultural and business life of Iceland from around 2002–2008. She is also the former wife of [[American Nazi Party]] founder [[George Lincoln Rockwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1967: 'American Hitler' shot dead|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/25/newsid_3031000/3031928.stm|website=BBC News|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and surname==

Þóra was born in [[Reykjavík]], the eldest daughter of [[Hallgrímur Fr. Hallgrímsson]], chairman of Shell in Iceland and consul in Canada, and his wife [[Margrét Þorbjörg Thors Hallgrímsson]], daughter of the businessman [[Thor Philip Axel Jensen]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/37260/; http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/286017/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ethnically Icelandic, Þóra's father Hallgrímur was born Canadian. His surname Hallgrímsson is in fact his father's [[patronym]], which his father had taken as a [[surname]] when moving to Canada. In turn, Þóra also inherited the surname, giving rise to the unusual situation of a female Icelander with a last name ending in -''son''.

At 14, Þóra was sent to boarding school in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Thor Bjorgolfsson and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust—And Back: How I Made, Lost and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way'' (London: Profile, 2014), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages==

While studying in England, Þóra received a marriage proposal from [[David Tomlinson]], whereupon her father had her return to Iceland, via a spell studying in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Thor Bjorgolfsson and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust—And Back: How I Made, Lost and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way'' (London: Profile, 2014)., p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Once in Iceland, Þóra met [[Haukur Clausen]],&lt;ref&gt;Thor Bjorgolfsson and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust—And Back: How I Made, Lost and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way'' (London: Profile, 2014)., p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; an Olympic athlete and later dentist, and married him on 6 January 1951.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Together they had Örn Friðrik (born 13 July 1951),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Cf. 'Haukur Clausen', ''Morgunblaðið'', 13 May 2003, http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/730658/.&lt;/ref&gt; but they separated just a year later due to Clausen having an affair with Þóra's best friend.&lt;ref&gt;Thor Bjorgolfsson and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust—And Back: How I Made, Lost and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way'' (London: Profile, 2014), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 October 1953 Þóra married [[George Lincoln Rockwell]], an officer in the American Navy and later founder of the [[American Nazi Party]], moving with him to America. With him she had three further children: Hallgrímur, Margrét, and Bentína.&lt;ref&gt;http://atlas.verslo.is/1962?s=nemendur_meira&amp;sid=6168{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}; http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/286017/.&lt;/ref&gt; In Roger Boyes's account,

::[[Olafur Thors]]’s niece Thora Hallgrimsdottir was in trouble. Thora was a free spirit. At a ball in Reykjavik she had fallen for a handsome American naval Officer, George Lincoln Rockwell—a war hero to boot—and abandoned her marriage to a well-connected Icelandic dentist to wed him. All harmless enough, except that Rockwell became a founder of the American Nazi Party and one of the most active racists in the United States. One of his missions was to take the Ku Klux Klan into the modern age; he coined the phrase White Power, organized rallies, operated a Hate Bus to stir up sentiment against African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Boyes, ''Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island'' (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts of Þóra's divorce from Rockwell, which include Rockwell's own autobiography, and her return to Iceland vary.  Her father Hallgrímur travelled to the United States in 1958 to bring his daughter home;&lt;ref&gt;George Lincoln Rockwell, ''This Time the World'' (Parliament House 1961; Reprinted by White Power Publications, 1979; and later Liberty Bell Publications, 2004, {{ISBN|1-59364-014-5}}), https://archive.org/details/ThisTimeTheWorld_37; Roger Boyes, ''Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island'' (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 63-64; Ingi Freyr Vilhjálmsson, ''Hamskiptin: Þegar allt varð falt á Íslandi'' (Reykjavík: Veröld, 2014), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; according to Boyes, the family asked [[Björgólfur Guðmundsson]] to help convince Þóra to return to Iceland, &lt;ref&gt;Roger Boyes, ''Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island'' (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt; but according to her son Björgólfur Thor, Þóra met Björgólfur Guðmundsson back in Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;Thor Bjorgolfsson and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust—And Back: How I Made, Lost and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way'' (London: Profile, 2014), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Either way, Þóra moved back with her four children,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/286017/&lt;/ref&gt; divorced Rockwell, and in 1963 married Björgólfur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americannaziparty.com/rockwell/materials/books/pdf/ThisTimeTheWorld.pdf ''This Time The World'', the autobiography of George Lincoln Rockwell]; Roger Boyes, ''Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island'' (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt; She had one son by Björgólfur, [[Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson]], but Björgólfur Guðmundsson also adopted Þóra's children by Rockwell.

Þóra's grandson, by her daughter Evelyn Bentína Björgólfsdóttir, is the footballer [[Björgólfur Hideaki Takefusa]].

==Controversy over biography==

In 2005, Guðmundur Magnússon published the book ''Thorsararnir'', on the history of the descendants of Thor Jensen. In the first version of the book was a chapter on Þóra's marriage with Rockwell. The book was published by the press Edda, but Björgólfur, who owned the publisher, had the author change the text. Moreover, he tried to buy the newspaper ''Dagblaðið-Vísir'', which had discussed the matter, in order to close it down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20091125043306/http%3A//www.dv.is/brennidepill/2008/11/1/ritskodari%2Deinokar%2Ddagbladamarkad/ Ritskoðari einokar dagblaðamarkað.] DV, 1. nóvember 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearances in popular culture ==

Þóra was the model for the character Lilja Jónsdóttir in the novel ''Sakleysingjarnir'' by [[Ólafur Jóhann Ólafsson|Ólaf Jóhann Ólafsson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=3613442 Aldarspegill sakleysingjanna.] Morgunblaðið, 31.

{{italic title}}
{{Nihongo3||物の哀れ|'''Mono no aware'''}}, literally "the pathos of things", and also translated as "an empathy toward things", or "a sensitivity to ephemera", is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for the awareness of {{nihongo|[[impermanence]]|無常|mujō}}, or transience of things, and both a transient gentle sadness (or wistfulness) at their passing as well as a longer, deeper gentle sadness about this state being the reality of life.

==Origins==
The term comes from Heian period literature, but was picked up and used by 18th century [[Edo period]] Japanese cultural scholar [[Motoori Norinaga]] in his literary criticism of ''[[The Tale of Genji]],'' and later to other seminal Japanese works including the ''[[Man'yōshū]]''. It became central to his philosophy of literature and eventually to [[Culture of Japan|Japanese cultural tradition]].

==Etymology==
The phrase is derived from the Japanese word {{nihongo3||物|mono}}, which means "thing", and {{nihongo3||哀れ|aware}}, which was a [[Heian period]] expression of measured surprise (similar to "ah" or "oh"), translating roughly as "pathos", "poignancy", "deep feeling", "sensitivity", or "awareness".  Thus, ''mono no aware'' has frequently been translated as "the 'ahh-ness' of things", life, and love. Awareness of the transience of all things heightens appreciation of their beauty, and evokes a gentle sadness at their passing. In his criticism of ''The Tale of Genji'' Motoori noted that ''mono no aware'' is the crucial emotion that moves readers. Its scope was not limited to [[Japanese literature]], and became associated with Japanese cultural tradition (see also ''[[sakura]]'').&lt;ref name=khoon&gt;Choy Lee, Khoon. ''Japan: Between Myth and Reality''. 1995, page 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In contemporary culture==
Notable [[manga]] artists who use ''mono no aware''–style storytelling include [[Hitoshi Ashinano]], [[Kozue Amano]], and [[Kaoru Mori]]. In [[anime]], both ''[[Only Yesterday (1991 film)|Only Yesterday]]'' by [[Isao Takahata]] and ''[[Mai Mai Miracle]]'' by [[Sunao Katabuchi]] emphasize the passing of time in gentle notes and by presenting the main plot against a parallel one from the past.  The Japanese director [[Yasujirō Ozu]] was well known for creating a sense of ''mono no aware'', frequently climaxing with a character very understatedly saying {{nihongo3|"Fine weather, isn't it?"|いい天気ですね|''"''Ii tenki desu ne''?"''}}, after a familial and societal paradigm shift, such as a daughter being married off, against the backdrop of a swiftly changing Japan. Ozu has often expressed feelings by showing the faces of objects rather than the face of an actor. Some examples include two fathers contemplating the rocks in a "dry landscape" garden, and a mirror reflecting the absence of the daughter who has just left home after getting married. These images exemplified ''mono no aware'' as powerfully as the expression on the greatest actor's face.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/japanese-aesthetics/|title=2. Mono no aware: the Pathos of Things|last=|first=|date=10 October 2011|website=plato.stanford.edu|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his book about courtly life in [[ancient Japan]], ''The World of the Shining Prince'', [[Ivan Morris]] compares ''mono no aware'' to [[Virgil]]'s term ''[[lacrimae rerum]]'', Latin for "tears of things".&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Ivan I. ''The World of the Shining Prince: Court Life in Ancient Japan''. 1994, page 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Science fiction]] author [[Ken Liu]]'s short story, "Mono no Aware", won the 2013 [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2013 Hugo Awards |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2013-hugo-awards/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906045317/http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2013-hugo-awards/ |archivedate=2015-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by works like the science fiction manga ''[[Yokohama Kaidashi Kikō]]'', Liu sought to evoke an "aesthetic primarily oriented towards creating in the reader an empathy towards the inevitable passing of all things", and to acknowledge "the importance of memory and continuity with the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mamatas |first=Nick |title=Q/A With Ken Liu (and the return of Intern Kathleen) |url=http://www.haikasoru.com/the-future-is-japanese/qa-with-ken-liu-and-the-return-of-intern-kathleen/ |publisher=Haikasoru |accessdate=7 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530040356/http://www.haikasoru.com/the-future-is-japanese/qa-with-ken-liu-and-the-return-of-intern-kathleen/ |archivedate=30 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel]]- and [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]]-winning British novelist [[Kazuo Ishiguro]] ends many of his novels without any sense of resolution. The issues his characters confront are buried in the past and remain unresolved. Thus Ishiguro ends many of his novels on a note of melancholic resignation. His characters accept their past and who they have become, typically discovering that this realization brings comfort and an ending to mental anguish. This can be seen as a literary reflection of the Japanese idea of ''mono no aware''.

Films like [[Alain Resnais]]'s ''[[Hiroshima Mon Amour]]'', [[ Shohei Imamura]]'s ''[[Black Rain (1989 Japanese film)|Black Rain]]'' and [[ Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[I Live in Fear]]'' have all been associated with the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crosscurrents.org/FeleppaSpring2004.htm|title=BLACK RAIN: Reflections on Hiroshima and Nuclear War in Japanese Film|author=|date=|website=www.crosscurrents.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030174259/http://www.crosscurrents.org/FeleppaSpring2004.htm|archivedate=30 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most well-known examples of ''mono no aware'' in contemporary Japan is the traditional love of cherry blossoms, found throughout Japanese art and perpetuated by the large masses of people that travel annually to view and picnic under cherry trees. The trees are not considered to be of special value concerning their beauty in relation to other trees, such as apple or pear trees. Cherry tree blossoms are valued because of their transience, normally associated with the fact that the blossoms fall off the tree after only a week or so after first budding. It is the evanescence of the beauty of the cherry blossom that evokes the weary perspective of ''mono no aware'' in the viewer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2643">In art, '''musivisual language''' is a [[Semiotics|semiotic]] system that is the synchronous union of music and image. The term was coined by Spanish composer [[Alejandro Román]], and for over a century, has appeared in film and other media (television, video or [[multimedia]]). 

== Definition ==
According to Román:

{{quote|''Musivisual Language'' is a special language of music placed in film and from film, understood not only from structural point of view, rhythm and sound-material, but also from the relationships and meaning semiotics in relation to the close interaction with the image and plot.'' |Román, 2008: 84}}

When film music and text connect, they produce meanings distinct from the separate elements. In this communication process, musical codes ([[melody]], rhythm, [[harmony]], sound, [[Texture (music)|texture]], [[Musical form|form]]), in synchrony with the film ([[image]], [[speech]], [[noise]]...) interact. 

Román defines two levels for this language: ''semiotic'', i.e. the contribution of meaning of music over the image, and the specific ''aesthetic'' of film music, which means it has its own stylistic elements not belonging to other musical forms. These elements are determined by the cinematic form.

'''Open content''' is a [[neologism]] coined by [[David A. Wiley|David Wiley]] in 1998&lt;ref name="grossman"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Grossman| first = Lev| title = New Free License to Cover Content Online| work = Netly News|accessdate = 2010-01-12| date = 18 July 1998| url = http://www.time.com/time/digital/daily/0,2822,621,00.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000619122406/http://www.time.com/time/digital/daily/0,2822,621,00.html |archivedate = 19 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes a [[creative work]] that others can copy or modify freely, [[Permission culture|without asking for permission]]. The term evokes the related concept of [[open-source software]].&lt;ref name="OpenContent19990128"&gt;{{cite web| last = Wiley| first = David| title = Open Content| work = OpenContent.org| accessdate = 2012-04-17| year = 1998| url = http://www.opencontent.org/home.shtml| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19990128224600/http://www.opencontent.org/home.shtml| archivedate = 28 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[content (media)|content]] is said to be under an '''open licence'''.

== History ==
Originally, the Open content [[concept]] was invented by Michael Stutz, who in 1994 wrote the paper "[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/nonsoftware-copyleft.en.html Applying Copyleft to Non-Software Information]" for the GNU Project. The "Open Content" term was later evangelized via the ''[[Open Content Project]]'' by [[David A. Wiley]] in 1998, and described works licensed under the [[Open Content License]] (a non-free share-alike license, see 'Free content' below) and other works licensed under similar terms.&lt;ref name="OpenContent19990128"/&gt;

It has since come to describe a broader class of content without conventional copyright restrictions. The [[openness]] of content can be assessed under the '5Rs Framework' based on the extent to which it can be reused, revised, remixed and redistributed by members of the public without violating copyright law.&lt;ref name="OpenContentDefinition"&gt;{{cite web | last = Wiley| first = David| title = Open Content| work = OpenContent.org| accessdate = 2011-11-18| url = http://opencontent.org/definition/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[free content]] and content under [[Open-source license|open-source licenses]], there is no clear threshold that a work must reach to qualify as 'open content'.

Although open content has been described as a counterbalance to [[copyright]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apdip.net/publications/fosseprimers/foss-opencontent-nocover.pdf |title=Lawrence Liang, "Free/Open Source Software Open Content", '&amp;#39;Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme: e-Primers on Free/Open Source Software'&amp;#39;, United Nations Development Programme – Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme, 2007. |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; open content licenses rely on a copyright holder's power to license their work, similarly as [[copyleft]] which also utilizes copyright for such a purpose.

In 2003 Wiley announced that the Open Content Project has been succeeded by [[Creative Commons]] and their [[Creative commons license|licenses]], where he joined as "Director of Educational Licenses".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030802222546/http://opencontent.org/ OpenContent is officially closed. And that's just fine.] on opencontent.org (30 June 2003, archived)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030806102812/http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/3733 Creative Commons Welcomes David Wiley as Educational Use License Project Lead] by matt (23 June 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the [[Creative Commons]]' successor project was the ''[[Definition of Free Cultural Works]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freedomdefined.org/index.php?title=Definition&amp;action=history |title=Revision history of "Definition" – Definition of Free Cultural Works |publisher=Freedomdefined.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[free content]], put forth by [[Erik Möller]],&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; [[Richard Stallman]], [[Lawrence Lessig]], [[Benjamin Mako Hill]],&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Angela Beesley,&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freedomdefined.org/History |title=History – Definition of Free Cultural Works |publisher=Freedomdefined.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. The ''Definition of Free Cultural Works'' is used by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:Licensing_policy |title=Resolution:Licensing policy |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation |date= |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Attribution and Attribution-ShareAlike [[Creative Commons licenses]] were marked as "Approved for Free Cultural Works" among other licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8051 |title=Approved for Free Cultural Works |publisher=Creative Commons |date=24 July 2009 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OK LOGO COLOUR RGB.svg|thumb|100px|[[Open Knowledge]] Foundation]]
Another successor project is the ''[[Open Knowledge Foundation]]'' (''OKF''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.timdavies.org.uk/2014/04/12/data-information-knowledge-and-power-exploring-open-knowledges-new-core-purpose/|title = Data, information, knowledge and power – exploring Open Knowledge's new core purpose |first = Tim|last = Davies|date = 12 April 2014|work = Tim's Blog|accessdate = 25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by [[Rufus Pollock]] in [[Cambridge]], UK in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blog.okfn.org/2004/05/24/open-knowledge-foundation-launched/|title = Open Knowledge Foundation launched|work = Open Knowledge Foundation Weblog|accessdate = 25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a global non-profit network to promote and share open content and data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Open Knowledge: About|url = https://okfn.org/about/|website = okfn.org|accessdate = 25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]] gave an ''Open Knowledge Definition'' for ''"Content such as music, films, books; Data be it scientific, historical, geographic or otherwise; Government and other administrative information"''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070818100846/http://www.opendefinition.org/1.0 version 1.0] on opendefinition.org (archived 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014 with version 2.0 ''Open Works'' and ''Open Licenses'' were defined and "open" is described as synonymous to the definitions of open/free in the [[Open Source Definition]], the [[Free Software Definition]] and the [[Definition of Free Cultural Works]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/ Open Definition 2.1] on opendefinition.org&lt;/ref&gt; A distinct difference is the focus given to the [[public domain]] and that it focuses also on the accessibility ("[[open access]]") and the readability ("[[open format]]s"). Among several conformant licenses, six are recommended, three own (Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and Licence (PDDL), Open Data Commons Attribution License (ODC-BY), [[Open Data Commons Open Database License]] (ODbL)) and the [[CC BY]], [[CC BY-SA]], and [[CC0]] creative commons licenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opendefinition.org/licenses/ licenses] on opendefintion.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.creativecommons.org/2013/12/27/creative-commons-4-0-by-and-by-sa-licenses-approved-conformant-with-the-open-definition/ Creative Commons 4.0 BY and BY-SA licenses approved conformant with the Open Definition] by Timothy Vollmer on creativecommons.org (27 December 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.creativecommons.org/2014/10/07/open-definition-2-0-released/ Open Definition 2.0 released] by Timothy Vollmer on creativecommons.rog (7 October 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Open content" definition ==

The OpenContent website once defined OpenContent as 'freely available for modification, use and redistribution under a license similar to those used by the open-source / free software community'.&lt;ref name="OpenContent19990128"/&gt; However, such a definition would exclude the [[Open Content License]] (OPL) because that license forbade charging 'a fee for the [OpenContent] itself', a right required by free and open-source software licenses.{{citation needed|reason=The FOSS licences require a right to charge a fee for creating or delivering a copy, not a right to charge for the content itself|date=March 2015}}

The term since shifted in meaning. OpenContent ''"is licensed in a manner that provides users with free and perpetual permission to engage in the 5R activities."''&lt;ref name="OpenContentDefinition"/&gt;

The 5Rs are put forward on the OpenContent website as a framework for assessing the extent to which content is open:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
#Retain – the right to make, own, and control copies of the content (e.g., download, duplicate, store, and manage)
#Reuse – the right to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g., in a class, in a study group, on a website, in a video)
#Revise – the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (e.g., translate the content into another language)
#Remix – the right to combine the original or revised content with other open content to create something new (e.g., incorporate the content into a mashup)
#Redistribute – the right to share copies of the original content, your revisions, or your remixes with others (e.g., give a copy of the content to a friend)&lt;ref name="OpenContentDefinition"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This broader definition distinguishes open content from open-source software, since the latter must be available for commercial use by the public. However, it is similar to several definitions for [[open educational resources]], which include resources under noncommercial and verbatim licenses.&lt;ref name="oer-review"&gt;{{Cite conference | publisher = The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation | last = Atkins | first = Daniel E. | author2 = John Seely Brown | author3 = Allen L. Hammond | title = A Review of the Open Educational Resources (OER) Movement: Achievements, Challenges, and New Opportunities | location = Menlo Park, CA | date = February 2007 | accessdate = 2010-12-03 | page = 4 | url = http://www.hewlett.org/uploads/files/Hewlett_OER_report.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/67UwoyzbR?url=http://www.hewlett.org/uploads/files/Hewlett_OER_report.pdf | archivedate = 8 May 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first = Guntram|last= Geser |title= Open Educational Practices and Resources.

The later ''[[The Open Definition|Open Definition]]'' by the Open Knowledge Foundation (now known as [[Open Knowledge International]]) define [[open knowledge]] with open content and [[open data]] as sub-elements and draws heavily on the [[Open Source Definition]]; it preserves the limited sense of open content as free content,&lt;ref name="Open Definition"&gt;{{cite web | title = Open Definition| work = OpenDefinition.org| accessdate = 2011-11-18| url = http://opendefinition.org/okd/}}&lt;/ref&gt; unifying both.

==Open access==
[[File:Open Access logo PLoS white.svg|thumb|100px|[[Open access]] logo, originally designed by [[Public Library of Science]]]]
"[[Open access]]" refers to toll-free or [[Gratis versus libre|gratis]] access to content, mainly published originally [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] scholarly journals. Some open access works are also licensed for reuse and redistribution ("libre open access"), which would qualify them as open content.

==Open content and education==
{{further|Open Education Resources}}
[[File:Global_Open_Educational_Resources_Logo.svg|thumb|100px|[[Open Educational Resources]] logo]]
[[File:Ocaheader.jpg|thumb|[[Open Content Alliance]] logo]]
Over the past decade, open content has been used to develop alternative routes towards higher education. Traditional universities are expensive, and their tuition rates are increasing.&lt;ref name="Tuition Inflation" &gt;{{cite web
| last = Kantrowitz| first = Mark| title = Tuition Inflation| work = FinAid.org| accessdate = 2012-04-18| year = 2012| url = http://www.finaid.org/savings/tuition-inflation.phtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open content allows a free way of obtaining higher education that is "focused on collective knowledge and the sharing and reuse of learning and scholarly content."&lt;ref name="Horizon Report"&gt;{{cite web| last = NMC| first = | title = One Year or Less: Open Content| work = 2010 Horizon Report| accessdate = 2012-04-18| year = 2012| url = http://wp.nmc.org/horizon2010/chapters/open-content/| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120316120303/http://wp.nmc.org/horizon2010/chapters/open-content/| archivedate = 16 March 2012| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are multiple projects and organizations that promote learning through open content, including [[OpenCourseWare| OpenCourseWare Initiative]], [[The Saylor Foundation]] and [[Khan Academy]]. Some universities, like [[MIT]], [[Yale]], and [[Tufts]] are making their courses freely available on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Textbooks===
{{main|Open textbooks}}
The textbook industry is one of the educational industries in which open content can make the biggest impact.&lt;ref name = "funny monkey"&gt;{{cite web
| last = Fitzgerald| first = Bill| title = Using Open Content To Drive Educational Change| work = Funny Monkey| accessdate = 2012-04-18| year = 2012| url = https://funnymonkey.com/2010/using-open-content-to-drive-educational-change }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional textbooks, aside from being expensive, can also be inconvenient and out of date, because of publishers' tendency to constantly print new editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| last = Moushon| first = James| title = e-Textbooks: How do they stack up against tradition textbooks| work = Self Publishing Review| accessdate = 2012-04-18| year = 2012| url =http://www.selfpublishingreview.com/blog/2011/02/e-textbooks-how-do-they-stack-up-against-traditional-textbooks/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Open textbooks]] help to eliminate this problem, because they are online and thus easily updatable. Being openly licensed and online can be helpful to teachers, because it allows the textbook to be modified according to the teacher's unique curriculum.&lt;ref name="funny monkey" /&gt; There are multiple organizations promoting the creation of openly licensed textbooks. Some of these organizations and projects include The University of Minnesota's Open Textbook Library, [[OpenStax CNX|Connexions]], [[OpenStax College]], The Saylor Foundation Open Textbook Challenge and [[Wikibooks]]

==Licenses==

According to the current definition of open content on the OpenContent website, any general, royalty-free copyright license would qualify as an open license because it 'provides users with the right to make more kinds of uses than those normally permitted under the law. These permissions are granted to users free of charge.'&lt;ref name="OpenContentDefinition" /&gt;

However, the narrower definition used in the Open Definition effectively limits open content to [[libre content]], any [[free content]] license, defined by the [[Definition of Free Cultural Works]], would qualify as an open content license. According to this narrower criteria, the following still-maintained licenses qualify:

* [[Creative Commons licenses]] (only [[Creative Commons Attribution]], [[CC BY-SA|Attribution-Share Alike]] and [[CC0|Zero]])
* [[Open Publication License]] (the original license of the [[Open Content Project]], the [[Open Content License]], did not permit for-profit copying of the licensed work and therefore does not qualify)
* [[Against DRM license]]
* [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (without invariant sections)
* [[Open Game License]] (a license designed for role-playing games by [[Wizards of the Coast]])
* [[Free Art License]]
(For more licenses see [[Open Knowledge]], [[Free content]] and [[Free Cultural Works]] licenses)

{{lang|de|'''Ordnung muss sein'''}} is a [[German language|German]] proverbial expression which translates as "there must be order." The idea of "order" is generally recognized as a key cliche for describing [[Culture of Germany|German culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tomalin|first=Barry|title=Germany - Culture Smart!: The Essential Guide to Customs &amp; Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=neGgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Ordnung+muss+sein%22&amp;dq=%22Ordnung+muss+sein%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=E67fTrauLZSutwfOxbjMBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA|year=2006|publisher=Kuperard|isbn=978-1-85733-306-0|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franz von Papen]], for instance, cited it in 1932 as [[Frederick the Great]]'s "classic expression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dodd|first=William J.|title=Jedes Wort wandelt die Welt: Dolf Sternbergers politische Sprachkritik|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0_PqTRgZOoC&amp;pg=PA143|year=2007|publisher=Wallstein|isbn=978-3-8353-0230-3|page=143|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a slogan used by [[Paul von Hindenburg]], it became "world famous" in 1930, according to ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1930/11/09/archives/german-pilots-course-is-a-long-hard-grind-work-at-transport-school.html|title=GERMAN PILOTS COURSE IS A LONG, HARD GRIND; Work at Transport School From Which von Gronan Flew Is Arduous--25 in 1,000 Applicants Get In|last=Graudenz|first=John|date=9 November 1930|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A longer version is contained in a mid-19th century collection of proverbs where the title is a [[Wellerism]]: {{lang|de|Ordnung muss sein, sagte Hans, da brachten sie ihn in das Spinnhaus}} (in English: "Order must be, said Hans, as they took him to the madhouse)."&lt;ref name=simrock&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAs-AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA361|title=Die deutschen Sprichwörter|last=Simrock|first=Karl|author-link=Karl Joseph Simrock|year=1846|location=Frankfurt am Main|page=361|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related German proverbs are {{lang|de|Ordnung ist das halbe Leben}},&lt;ref name=simrock/&gt; literally "order is half of life", humorously extended in the [[Anti-proverb|antiproverb]] {{lang|de|und Unordnung die andere Hälfte}} ("and disorder the other half"). Similarly, a proverb says {{lang|de|Wer Ordnung hält, ist nur zu faul zum Suchen}} meaning "he who keeps order is just too lazy to spend his time searching".{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

There is an {{lang|de|[[Municipal police (Germany)|Ordnungsamt]]}} (Public Office for Order, [[Code enforcement]]) in every German municipality and city. Minor or petty offenses are called {{lang|de|Ordnungswidrigkeit}} (meaning "offense, (or rather) contrarity to (public) order" or indeed the American (among others) similar concept of disorderly conduct).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8026">[[File:Venise, Pala d'Oro exposée.JPG|thumb|300px|Pala d'Oro viewed in its altarpiece setting]]
'''Pala d’Oro''' ([[Italian Language|Italian]], "Golden [[Pall (liturgy)|Pall]]" or "Golden Cloth") is the high [[altar]] [[retable]] of the [[St Mark's Basilica|Basilica di San Marco]] in [[Venice]]. It is universally recognized as one of the most refined and accomplished works of [[Byzantine enamel]], with both front and rear sides decorated.

== History ==
[[File:Pala D'Oro Markusdom Venedig.jpg|thumb|300px|Pala d'Oro from a closer view]]
The Pala d’Oro was thought to be first commissioned in 976 by Doge [[Pietro I Orseolo|Pietro Orseolo]], where it was made up of precious stones and several enamels depicting various saints, and in 1105 it was expanded on by Doge Ordelaffo Falier.&lt;ref&gt;Paoletti and Radke 1997, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1345, goldsmith Giovanni Paolo Bonesegna was commissioned to complete the altarpiece by [[Andrea Dandolo]], who was the procurator at the time, and later became doge. Bonesegna added a Gothic-style frame to the piece, along with more precious stones.&lt;ref name=vio2000&gt;Vio, 2000, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Dandolo also included an inscription describing what his own additions were, along with those of his predecessors.&lt;ref name=vio2003&gt;Vio 2003, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paolo Veneziano]] was commissioned to make wood panels to provide a cover for when the altarpiece was not on display.&lt;ref&gt;Paoletti and Radke 1997, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Veneziano was commissioned between 1342-4 to make this cover, where it was dated 1345 and signed by him along with his sons, Luca and Giovanni.&lt;ref name=gibbs2014&gt;Gibbs 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The cover is made from two pieces. The top plank features the [[Man of Sorrows]] in the center, who is surrounded by the Virgin and Sts. [[John the Baptist|John]], [[Saint George|George]], [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and [[Saint Nicholas|Nicholas]].&lt;ref name=gibbs2014 /&gt; The bottom plank shows narratives of Life, Martyrdom, Burial, and Translation of St Mark.&lt;ref name=gibbs2014 /&gt; The wooden panels were opened to the public during liturgies only. In the 15th century, Veneziano's "exterior" altarpiece was replaced by a wooden panel which remains today, though the Pala is now always open.

==Description==
[[Image:SanMarcoPalaDOroDevelopmentEn.png|thumb|300px|Development and elements of the Pala d’Oro]]
The [[altarpiece]] is 3 meters (9.8 ft) wide by 2 meters (6.6 ft) tall.&lt;ref&gt;Vio, 2000, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; It is made of gold and silver,&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 187 [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] plaques,&lt;ref name=gibbs2014 /&gt; and 1,927 gems.&lt;ref name=vio2000 /&gt; These include 526 pearls, 330 garnets, 320 emeralds, 255 sapphires, 183 amethysts, 175 agates, 75 rubies, 34 topazes, 16 [[Carnelian|carnelians]], and 13 jaspers.&lt;ref name=vio2000 /&gt;

===Top Section===
The altarpiece consists of two parts. The enamels in the top section of the Pala d’Oro contain the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] at the center, with six images depicting the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]] on either side of him, which were added in 1209. They show the Entry of Christ into Jerusalem, Descent into Limbo, Crucifixion, Ascension, Pentecost, and Death of the Virgin.&lt;ref name=vio2000 /&gt; It’s generally thought that these weren’t originally part of the altarpiece, as their stylistic features place them into the 12th century, and they were probably looted during the [[Fourth Crusade]].&lt;ref&gt;Gonosová 1978, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bottom Section===
The bottom section contains the enamels that told the Life of [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]]. These were created in 1105 in [[Constantinople]], and were commissioned by [[Doge]] [[Ordelafo Faliero|Ordelaffo Falier]].&lt;ref name=vio166&gt;Vio, 2000, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; They used to be positioned along the base, but have since been moved to their current position along the sides and the top row of this section.&lt;ref name=vio166 /&gt;
[[File:Pala d'oro, cristo in smalto al centro.jpg|thumb|300px|The central panel of [[Christ in Majesty]]]]
Also in the bottom section is an enamel depicting Christ at the center of the altarpiece, and the four circular enamels around him are images of the [[Four Evangelists]].&lt;ref name=vio166 /&gt; To the right and left of Christ are the twelve apostles, six to each side. Above Christ is an empty throne, which represents the [[Last Judgment|Last Judgement]] and the [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Christ]], with angels and archangels on either side of it.&lt;ref name=vio2003 /&gt; Underneath Christ and the apostles are the twelve prophets, with the Virgin—flanked by Falier and Empress [[Irene of Athens|Irene]]—at the center.&lt;ref name=vio166 /&gt;

===Doge Falier and Empress Irene===
[[File:Venezia, pala d'oro, madonna tra i donatori irene e l'imperatore Giovanni II Comneno, trasformato nel doge Ordelaffo Falier.JPG|thumb|300px|Doge Ordelaffo Falier, the Virgin, and Empress Irene]]
The two figures surrounding the Virgin are images of Doge Ordelaffo Falier and Byzantine Empress Irene.&lt;ref name=buckton43&gt;Buckton and Osborne 2000, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction of Falier seems to be slightly off as his head is too small in proportion to his body. There is evidence that shows the original head was removed, and replaced with a new one.&lt;ref name=buckton43 /&gt; There are also scratches on the enamel from when the previous head was removed, and some type of wax or paste was used to fill in the gaps where the replacement piece didn’t exactly fit.&lt;ref name=buckton44&gt;Buckton and Osborne 2000, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

While there have been theories that the previous head depicted an emperor, that explanation doesn’t quite fit. Emperors are usually depicted with red footwear, and this figure is wearing black footwear, with no signs of being altered.&lt;ref name=buckton44 /&gt; Additionally, the enamel bears Falier’s name, which would have required a lot of effort to change, and would have left evidence behind.&lt;ref name=buckton44 /&gt; The most likely explanation is that the original head was in fact Falier’s head, but without a halo.&lt;ref name=buckton44 /&gt; Later, church officials—possibly even Falier himself—decided to replace it to include a halo. The scepter he’s holding restricted how much could be altered, which required the crafters to make the new image slightly smaller.&lt;ref name=buckton44 /&gt;

{{italic title}}
The '''''Pentagonia''''' is the collective title of a series of five novels by Cuban author [[Reinaldo Arenas]]. It was subtitled by its author "''the secret history of Cuba''." The novels were written from the mid-1960s through the late 1980s, and indeed, as was recounted in Arenas' autobiography [[Before Night Falls|''Before Night Falls'']], were rewritten many times as manuscripts were lost, destroyed and/or  confiscated by Cuban authorities. Each of the novels is semi-autobiographical and indeed has Arenas as one, if not more than one, of the major characters.

==Book One==
The first volume, ''[[Singing from the Well]],'' was originally published as ''Celestino antes del alba'' in 1967, the only Arenas novel to be published in Cuba. The book recounts the history of a young child, Celestino, growing up in the province of Oriente, [[Cuba]]. Celestino was a child ostracized by his family because of his literary talents. He would write on trees and in retaliation his grandfather denuded the forest.

==Book Two==
The second volume, ''[[Palace of the White Skunks]],'' focuses on adolescent Fortunato who was raised in a house of frustrated aunts, a primal grandmother, and an emasculated grandfather. Set during the [[Cuban Revolution|1959 Cuban Revolution]], the novel follows the main character as he clumsily joins the rebels. The acclaimed editor, Thomas Colchie, has written, that in this work, “Arenas has created a haunting family portrait, combining the lyrical empathy of a Tennessee Williams toward his characters’ troubled lives with a radically fractured narrative that pays dark tribute less to Faulkner than to the schizophrenia of life under any dictatorial extreme.” (Colchie 2001)

==Book Three==
The Third volume, ''[[Farewell to the Sea]],'' is a divided novel, telling the story of a married couple on a six-day vacation on the Cuban coast. The first half is a prosaic stream of consciousness narrative of the troubled wife demonstrating her love and inability to understand her husband, Hector. The last half of the novel is composed of six poetic cantos sung in silence to the sea by Hector, a poet who is no longer allowed to write and who has been compelled to enter into a sham marriage to avoid the charge of homosexuality. It is a story of a marriage of two people who, while sharing genuine affection, are so different and incompatible that they not only cannot communicate, they fail to speak in the same terms, one in prose and the other in poetry.

==Book Four==
In the fourth volume, ''[[The Color of Summer]]'', Arenas appears as three characters: Gabriel, the dutiful "straight" son; Reinaldo, the expatriate author; and Skunk in a Funk, the "picaro" – [[Faggot (slang)|faggot]] – who seeks merely to live and work as an artist in Castro’s Cuba while engaging in anonymous sex. The novel is set in a carnival celebrating the 50th anniversary of the revolution and breaks many, if not all of the norms of narrative story telling (the "Foreword" appears on page 252). In that foreword, Arenas states that the novel is a "grotesque and satirical (and therefore realistic) portrait of an aging tyranny and the tyrant himself..."  He adds that the novel “is not a linear work, but circular, and therefore cyclonic, with a vortex or eye – the Carnival – towards which all vectors whirl."

==Book Five==
The fifth and final volume, ''The Assault'', is a dark and Kafkaesque vision of a future
Cuba, where homosexuality is punishable by death, told by a repressed homosexual turned government agent for the "Bureau of Counterwhispering" as he searches to destroy all whispers, homosexuals, dissidents and most particularly his own mother.

==Overview==
Writing about the entire Pentagonia, Arenas wrote, in the foreword to ''The Color of Summer'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;In all of these novels, the central character is an author, a witness, who dies but in the next novel is reborn under a different name yet with the same angry rebellious goal: to chant or recount the horror and the life of the people, including his own. There thus remains, in the midst of a terrible, tempestuous time, a life raft, a ship of hope, the intransigence of man the creator, the poet, the rebel –standing firm before all those repressive principals which, if they could, would destroy him utterly – one of those principals being the horror that he himself exudes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Mulligans session.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Irish music enthusiasts gather at a pub to play music and drink [[beer]]]]

A '''pub session''' ('''seisiún''' in [[Irish Language|Irish]]; '''seshoon''' in [[Manx Gaelic]]) is performing music in the setting of a [[public house|local pub]], in which the music-making is intermingled with the consumption of ale, stout, and beer and conversation.&lt;ref name="Rough Guides 1999"&gt;{{cite book |title=World Music: Africa, Europe and the Middle East |publisher=Rough Guides |series=Music reference series |year=1999 |isbn=978-1-85828-635-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gyiTOcnb2yYC&amp;pg=PA172 |access-date=September 17, 2018 |page=172-173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performers sing and play traditional songs and tunes&lt;ref name="Rough Guides 1999" /&gt; from the Irish, English, Scottish and Manx traditions, using instruments such as the [[fiddle]], [[accordion]], [[concertina]], [[flute]], [[tin whistle]], [[uilleann pipes]], [[tenor banjo]], [[guitar]], and [[bodhrán]].&lt;ref name="Traditiones 2012"&gt;{{cite book |title=Traditiones |publisher=Slovenska akademija znanosti in umetnosti, Razred za filološke in literarne vede. |issue=v. 41, no. 1 |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S9_sIfjYdhcC |access-date=24 September 2018 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Singing and consuming alcohol have been practised together from ancient times,{{when|date=September 2018}} but the written evidence is fragmentary until the 16th century. In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Henry IV, Part 1|''Henry IV'']], Hal and [[Falstaff]] discuss drinking and playing the "tongs and the bones". There are depictions of pub singing in paintings by Teniers (1610–1690) Brouwer (1605/6-1638) and [[Jan Steen]] (1625/5-1656).

=== 1800 to 1950 ===

The 1830 Beer Act abolished the levy on beer and within a single year 400 new pubs opened and within 8 years there were 46,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oldcannonbrewery.co.uk/5.html |title=History |date=2007-01-10 |access-date=2018-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110215128/http://www.oldcannonbrewery.co.uk/5.html |archivedate=10 January 2007 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number peaked in the 1870s and declined after 1900. By the 1850s, an increasing number of student songs and commercial song-books were published across Europe. The most famous was the ''Scottish Students' Song Book'' by [[John Stuart Blackie]] (1809–1895).  The mixture of traditional songs with hints of erotic humour continues to this day.  The Irish tradition also benefited from the compilation of O'Neill's ''Music of Ireland'', a compilation of 1,850 pieces of Irish session and dance music, published initially by [[Francis O'Neill]] (1848–1936) in 1903.

One of the most popular drinking songs, "[[Little Brown Jug (song)|Little Brown Jug]]," dates from the 1860s. By 1908 [[Percy Grainger]] had begun to record folk singers, but not in their natural habitat—the pub. In 1938 [[A.L. Lloyd]] persuaded his employers at the [[BBC]] to record the singers in the Eel's Foot pub in Eastbridge, [[Suffolk]].

At The Eel's Foot, 1939–47, the songs performed included: "False Hearted Knight", "The Dark-Eyed Sailor", "The Princess Royal", "The [[Foggy Dew (English song)|Foggy Dew]]", "Underneath Her Apron", "Pleasant and Delightful", "The Blackbird." Surprisingly, one of the songs was "Poor Man's Heaven" an American IWW song ([[Industrial Workers of the World]]), dating from about 1920. The oldest singer there was William "Velvet" Brightwell (1865–1960). In 1947 the BBC made more recordings there and broadcast them as "Anglia Sings" on 19 November 1947. Almost all of the participants were in their 50s and 60s. Six years later the first folk club opened in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], and the average age was in the 20s.

== Instruments ==
[[File:Nash-session.jpg|thumb|Various instruments being played at a pub session]]

The [[fiddle]] has predominated since the 17th century. The [[Diatonic button accordion#Melodeon|melodeon]] became popular in the 1890s. By the 1950s the [[accordion]] took over, particularly in Scotland. By the 1960s the [[guitar]] was the instrument most frequently heard in a pub. Nowadays so many people can afford instruments that ensemble playing is the norm. [[Celtic music|Celtic]] tunes are popular, even in England, however English music is enjoying a large revival currently, due in part to 'new-folk' artists playing traditional English music, such as Bellowhead and Eliza Carthy. Some people go to folk festivals simply in order to play along with others in the beer tent.

=== Choosing an instrument ===

Each session has its own informal rules as to which instruments are acceptable and in what number. Some sessions may have a strict "'traditional' instruments only" rule whereas others will accept anyone who shows up to play with any instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/marjorie-freimuth/an-outsiders-guide-to-a-d_b_9556002.html |title=An Outsider's Guide to a Dublin Pub Session |last=Freimuth |first=Marjorie |date=2016-04-18 |website=Huffington Post |language=en-US |access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''traditional'' is used loosely as sessions themselves are a relatively recently revived phenomenon and some instruments considered 'traditional,' such as the [[bouzouki]] are in fact relatively new to the genres played at a session. It is wise to ask about what is expected at a particular session before bringing a non-'traditional' instrument.

Generally there can be an unlimited number of [[fiddle]]s, [[flute]]s, [[accordion]]s and [[tin whistle]]s. The [[bodhrán]] is common in Irish sessions, but many sessions prefer that only one person play the bodhrán at a time. [[Uilleann pipes]] are common in Irish sessions, but the more commonly known [[Great Highland Bagpipe]]s are never used in a session, because they drown out other instruments. [[Mandolin]]s, [[banjo]]s, [[cittern]]s and [[bouzouki]]s are welcome in moderation. [[Guitar]]s and [[Appalachian dulcimer|dulcimers]] are frequently allowed in sessions without strict "'traditional' instruments only" rules.

== Etiquette ==
There are "open sessions", when anyone who wishes can play, and "closed sessions", where the playing is restricted to a group. The general rules are fairly simple, but depend on the kind of session. In general, pub sessions are not places for learning an instrument. It is expected that those taking part have attained competence in playing their instrument. Some sessions are wholly instrumental while others will engage the crowd with singing. It is customary to introduce oneself to the other participants before joining in. There will usually be a leader or oldest member who sets the tone and keeps the session running smoothly; often leader(s) do not appear to be leaders at all.  Occasionally, even the leaders of a session may not realize that they lead.

Practically, however, there are always leaders at a session, by the nature of human dynamics.  Some sessions follow a round-robin structure, others have a more free-for-all approach, and the leader(s) of a session should be observed to see how this particular session is run.  Due to freeform nature of the session, there is always an element of serendipity and there is an atmosphere of anticipation and an expectation of tolerance from all present.

It is frowned upon when one openly criticises people who know only one song or only a few tunes.  Sessions are occasions to be enjoyed by all participants and if others are accepted members of the group, it's not up to one person (other than the leaders of the session) to decide that they are not welcome.

== Legal considerations ==
In England and Wales the [[Licensing Act 2003]] came into force in 2005. It could be interpreted as meaning that any performer would be obliged to give prior notification to police, fire brigade and environmental health. Following much lobbying by various groups, the law settled down to allow "spontaneous" events and religious events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randomdestination.co.uk/ChippenhamMorris/license.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515224528/http://www.randomdestination.co.uk/ChippenhamMorris/license.htm |archivedate=15 May 2006 |df=dmy-all}} License&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert King "Bob" Wittman''' was a highly decorated [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] Special Agent who was assigned to the [[Philadelphia]] Field Division from 1988 to 2008. As a result of specialized training in art, antiques, jewelry and gem identification, Wittman served as the FBI's "top investigator and coordinator in cases involving art theft and art fraud".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ignacio Villarreal |url=http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=2&amp;int_new=27842 |title=FBI's Top Investigator Involving Art Theft and Art Fraud, Robert Wittman, Retires |publisher=Artdaily.com |date=2008-12-16 |accessdate=2011-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his 20 years with the FBI, Wittman helped recover more than $300 million worth of stolen art and cultural property, resulting in the prosecution and conviction of numerous individuals. In 2005, he was instrumental in the creation of the FBI's rapid deployment Art Crime Team (ACT). He was named the ACT's Senior Investigator and was responsible for instructing the newly formed team. He also was instrumental in the recovery of colonial North Carolina's copy of the original [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] in 2005, after it was stolen by a Union soldier in 1865. Wittman represented the [[United States]] around the world, conducting investigations and instructing international police and museums in recovery and security techniques. After his 20 years with the FBI working against [[art theft]], he continues to use his expertise as an art security [[consultant]] for the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robertwittmaninc.com/|title=Robert Wittman Inc. ~ Art Recovery, Art Security, Art Protection|work=robertwittmaninc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Wittman published his memoir ''Priceless'' which recounts his career and activities while working for the FBI as an undercover agent.

==Early life and career==
Robert Wittman was born in [[Tokyo, Japan]] in 1955. Wittman's mother is Japanese and his father American; they met while his father was stationed with the US Air Force in Tokyo during the [[Korean War]]. He came to the [[United States]] in 1957 and lived in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], where his mother and father owned and ran an antique store. It was in this antique store that Wittman learned the business of art. He graduated from [[Calvert Hall College High School]] in 1973. Following [[high school]], he attended [[Towson University]] and received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Political Science]] in 1980. Wittman initially found employment with a Maryland agricultural magazine where he learned how to be an effective salesman, a skill to which he attributes his success later in undercover stings. He married Donna Goodhand Wittman in 1982 and has 3 children. He joined the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] in 1988 and was assigned to the Philadelphia Field Division where he went into the field of tracking down stolen art. His reputation within the FBI for solving art theft cases grew during the 1980s and 1990s. In 2005 Wittman was instrumental in the formation of the FBI's Art Crime Team, the first of its type.  He worked closely with federal prosecutors Robert Goldman and [[David Locke Hall]].

[[Image:Dürer - Michaels Kampf mit dem Drachen.jpg|thumb|''Saint Michael Fighting the Dragon'' by Albrecht Durer'']]
'''''Saint Michael Fighting the Dragon''''' is a [[woodcut]] of 1498 by [[Albrecht Dürer]], part of an ''[[Apocalypse (Dürer)|Apocalypse]]'' based on the ''[[Book of Apocalypse]]'' or Revelation of St. John.&lt;ref&gt;"St. Michael Fighting the Dragon"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject==
"And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven" (Rev. 12:7). As recounted by the Revelation of Saint John, at the end of the world war will break at between Heaven and Hell, between good and evil. As the commander of the Army of God, [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] leads the other angels in the fight against evil, represented in this picture by a seven-headed dragon. Each of the dragon’s heads represents one of the seven deadly sins.&lt;ref&gt;"The Revelation of St John"&lt;/ref&gt; Dürer chose to capture this fight between good and evil at the moment when Saint Michael is thrusting his spear into one of the heads. Surrounding Saint Michael are three other angels ready to attack. Beneath the fighting lies a calm and serene landscape with mountains and a small town, highlighted by a church with a tall spire, in the distance. At the bottom in the center of the page Dürer has placed his distinctive “AD” monogram that is in all of his engravings.

== Characteristics==
Albrecht Dürer considered [[printmaking]] to be one of the most important art forms, possibly even equal to the art of painting.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi. Durer.&lt;/ref&gt; His technical skill is well demonstrated in ''St. Michael Fighting the Dragon''. The influence of Dürer's training under [[Michael Wolgemut]] on the quality of Dürer's works can be seen in the vast amount of detail in the print. Dürer includes details ranging from the small trees surrounding the town to details of St. Michael’s face.  Dürer uses [[Aerial perspective|atmospheric perspective]] to create the illusion of space by depicting the mountains with less detail the farther away they are supposed to be. He creates different light and dark tones through his use of lines. In respect to the poses of the figures, especially Archangel Michael, Dürer broke with the traditional pose for a hero fighting against evil that was more elegant and instead put St. Michael in a pose that captures the magnitude of the task at hand.&lt;ref&gt;"The Revelation of St John"&lt;/ref&gt; St. Michael’s eyebrows are furrowed with concentration and his hands are on the sword, about to fiercely attack the dragon. All original woodcuts in the series were made on pear wood.

==Background==

===Humanism===
Beginning in the 14th century with the work of [[Petrarch]], the father of [[humanism]], humanist ideals began to spread throughout Europe. Early humanists stressed the importance of studying the classics, Greek and Roman works, and learning the liberal arts. During the 15th century, Renaissance humanists, applied humanism to their civic lives and stated that people should use their knowledge in the service of the state. They also believed that individuals had a great potential to succeed and could use that potential to improve society. In northern Europe, Christian Humanists combined humanist ideals with Christianity by emphasizing both education and scriptural knowledge. Artistically, humanists encouraged the study of the human form to accurately portray the beauty of the human body. One of the leading Christian Humanists was [[Desiderius Erasmus]], who became a friend of Albrecht Dürer when Dürer visited the Netherlands in 1520 and 1521.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi. Durer.&lt;/ref&gt; Well before that visit, Dürer traveled to Italy in the autumn of 1494 and talked with many Italian humanists. He also visited the workshops of numerous Italian humanist artists, including [[Andrea Mantegna]] and [[Giovanni Bellini]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi. Durer.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this exposure to humanism and Italian art, Dürer became fascinated with how to best capture the proportions of the human body and consequently spent much time studying the human body and anatomical proportions. This interest can not only be seen in many of his paintings, but also in a number of his engravings, including ''St. Michael Fighting the Dragon.''

===Rise of Nuremberg===
Another major influence on Dürer’s works was the rise of [[Nuremberg]] as an intellectual center and as a leader in engravings. One of the main reasons behind Nuremberg's prominence was the release of the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' in 1493. This book contained around 650 original illustrations from [[Michael Wolgemut]], one of the leading engravers of the late-Gothic era, and his workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Kleiner and Helen Gardner. Gardner’s Art Through the Ages.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Nuremberg Chronicle'' not only demonstrated the capabilities of the new printing press, but also paved the way for the work of Albrecht Dürer in the coming years.
[[Image:Nuernberg schedel.JPG|thumb|Picture of Nuremberg from the ''Nuremberg Chronicle'']]
Albrecht Dürer was an apprentice under Wolgemut and learned the art of engraving from one of the most well known engravers of the time. Technically, the development of better printing presses in Nuremberg allowed for Dürer to include much more detail in his work, from depicting St. Michael’s hair with little curls to capturing the sails of two boats off in the distance.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Kleiner and Helen Gardner. Gardner’s Art Through the Ages.&lt;/ref&gt; It also allowed for his work to be more easily distributed.

A sculpture garden may be private, owned by a museum and accessible freely or for a fee, or public and accessible to all. Some cities own large numbers of [[public art|public sculptures]], some of which they may present together in city [[park]]s.

Exhibits range from individual, traditional sculptures to large [[site-specific art|site-specific]] [[installation art|installations]]. Sculpture gardens may also vary greatly in size and scope, either featuring the collected works of multiple artists, or the artwork of a single individual.

== History ==
Sculpture gardens have a long history around the world - the oldest known collection of human constructions is a [[Neanderthal]] "sculpture garden" unearthed in Bruniquel Cave in France in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jaubert|first=Jacques|last2=Verheyden|first2=Sophie|last3=Genty|first3=Dominique|last4=Soulier|first4=Michel|last5=Cheng|first5=Hai|last6=Blamart|first6=Dominique|last7=Burlet|first7=Christian|last8=Camus|first8=Hubert|last9=Delaby|first9=Serge|date=2016-06-02|title=Early Neanderthal constructions deep in Bruniquel Cave in southwestern France|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v534/n7605/full/nature18291.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=534|issue=7605|pages=111–114|doi=10.1038/nature18291|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the cave, broken stalagmites were arranged in a series of stacked or ring-like structures approximately 175,000 years ago.

In the United States, the oldest public sculpture garden is a part of the joint park and wildlife preserve [[Brookgreen Gardens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciway.net/sc-photos/georgetown-county/brookgreen-gardens.html|title=Brookgreen Gardens - Murrells Inlet South Carolina SC|website=www.sciway.net|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; located in South Carolina.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9670">'''Soviet Unterzoegersdorf''' ({{lang-de|Sowjet-Unterzögersdorf}}) is a fictitious country created by the art/technology/theory group [[monochrom]]. It is the "last existing [[appanage]] republic of the [[USSR]]", located inside the Republic of Austria. Unterzögersdorf is partially based on an existing village&lt;ref&gt;[http://sulphuroxide.com/tag/cheetos/ so2/rhizomatic architecture, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; well-known to [[Johannes Grenzfurthner]], the creator of the concept. As a kid and teenager, Grenzfurthner spent a lot of time at his grandparents' farm in the small village of Unterzögersdorf (a cadastral municipality of Stockerau). His grandparents' stories about the Naziism, WWII and the Soviet occupation in allied-occupied Austria (1945-1955) form the inspirational basis of the long-term project ''Soviet Unterzoegersdorf''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fm4v2.orf.at/glashuettner/92453/main.html FM4: "Kurzbesuch in Sowjet-Unterzögersdorf", 23 July 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

:In the early 2000s, notorious Austrian art group monochrom decided to have a little fun with the spirit of Ostalgie (nostalgia for the Soviet era), the cultural whiplash from the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union a decade earlier. monochrom founder Johannes Grenzfurthner, having been born well after the USSR ceded East Austria in 1955, realized he knew nothing about the Soviet occupation of his hometown, the tiny rural hamlet of Unterzoegersdorf, aside from the hyperbolic, implausibly demonic stories his grandmother had told him when he was young. He was curious about that era, but the older generation was unwilling to talk. (Considering the shame of Anschluss followed by ten years of Soviet annexation, could anyone blame them? As Grenzfurthner himself put it, "We Austrians are known for two things: Classical music and mass murder.") Leave the past behind, they said. No one wants to remember Soviet Unterzoegersdorf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.livejournal.com/erf-/868742.html "in soviet unterzoegersdorf, game play you", ERF_, 11 December 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Debates triggered by postmodern culture have directed monochrom's attention towards questions of representation and relevance of "history" and stories. With Soviet Unterzoegersdorf a fictitious and misplaced handling of the past and the present is being discussed and put to use. In this regard, the project is also taking part in the production as well as the criticism of cultural and collective memories.

Monochrom transformed the basic theoretical concept into various projects ([[LARPs]], [[computer game]]s, [[short film]]s, performances).

A short film ("Der Installateur (bis 14:28)") about a plumber trying to cross the border of Soviet Unterzoegersdorf to repair a nuclear warm-water boiler.

==Public theatre performances (2001 and 2002)==
In 2001, ten years after the end of the Soviet Union, monochrom transformed the theoretical concept into an [[improvisational theatre]]/[[performance]]/[[LARP]] that lasted for a couple of days. They organized bus tours from [[Vienna]] to Unterzoegersdorf—a small Lower Austrian village that really exists—and acted the setting; beginning with the harsh EU [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] border control.

In 2002 they staged the 55th anniversary of the Communist Party of Soviet Unterzoegersdorf. Among other things monochrom presented a computer called "Hyper Hegel" that was powered with burning wood and that would only run a low tech version of  [[Tetris]]. Later "Hyper Hegel" was presented as an art installation in exhibitions.

* ''Soviet Unterzoegersdorf: Sector I''

In 2005 monochrom presented the first part of a computer game trilogy: "Soviet Unterzoegersdorf – The Adventure Game" (using [[Adventure Game Studio|AGS]]). To monochrom it was clear that the [[adventure game]] would provide the perfect media platform to communicate the idea of Soviet Unterzoegersdorf.

The first part of the game was very popular and was well received in the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://next.liberation.fr/next/010146686-un-saut-chez-les-soviets ''Un saut chez les Soviets'', in: Libération (by Marie Lechner), April 28, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The game magazine [[Edge (games magazine)|Edge]] chose the game as their 'internet game of the month' of November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monochrom.sil.at/suzoeg_edge112005.jpg ''The Edge'', Internet Game of the Month, November 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The back story of the adventure game series features the really existing [[Tumulus]] of Unterzoegersdorf.

* ''Soviet Unterzoegersdorf: Sector II''

Soviet Unterzoegersdorf: Sector II was presented on December 28, 2008 at the 25th [[Chaos Communication Congress]] in Berlin. The game features special guest appearances of [[Cory Doctorow]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Jello Biafra]], [[Jason Scott Sadofsky|Jason Scott]], [[Bre Pettis]] and [[MC Frontalot]]. The game was released in March 2009 in [[San Francisco]].

==Interventions (2008–)==
In 2008 monochrom staged a couple of public appearances of "His Excellency Ambassador of Soviet Unterzoegersdorf, Nikita Chrusov" in the United States. The "Ambassador" (played by monochrom member [[Johannes Grenzfurthner]]) visited a [https://web.archive.org/web/20080506022854/http://en.oreilly.com/et2008/public/schedule/detail/2163 corporate afterparty of ''Disney.com''] at the Marriott Hotel in [[San Diego]] (part of O'Reilly [[Emerging Technology Conference]]). He wanted to talk to executives about "the sugar-coated bullets" the corporation is firing at "his country" and other concepts of "cultural imperialism". The "Ambassador" [https://web.archive.org/web/20080531023738/http://tv.boingboing.net/2008/03/11/nikita-chrusov-crash.html got expelled] from the party by Disney personnel.

On September 11, 2009 the "Soviet Unterzoegersdorf Intelligence Corps" released a [http://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20090910_OTS0075/sowjet-unterzoegersdorfer-nachrichtendienst-veroeffentlicht-oesterreichische-flugfunkfrequenzen press statement] referring to a pretty detailed [http://kpdsuzoed.unterzoegersdorf.su/ list] of Austrian civilian and military air traffic frequencies and recordings of two embarrassing conversations on Austrian police radio.

==Sierra Zulu (2011–)==
monochrom [http://www.sierra-zulu.com/ announced on September 12, 2011] that they are working on a feature-length film that is set in the universe of Soviet Unterzoegersdorf. They are collaborating with the Austrian film production company Golden Girls Filmproduktion.
Johannes Grenzfurthner gave a presentation at [http://www.tedxvienna.at/blog/johannes-grenzfurthner-sierra-zulu/ TEDxVienna] about the project.

On February 4, 2012 monochrom and Golden Girls Filmproduktion premiered the 16-minute short film [http://www.sierra-zulu.com/earthmoving "Earthmoving"]. It is a prequel to the feature film Sierra Zulu and features actors Jeff Ricketts, Martin Auer, Lynsey Thurgar, Adrienne Ferguson and Alexander Fennon.

==Side projects==
[[monochrom]] created an acclaimed series of video spots for [[Boing Boing]] Video, dealing with a mysterious packages full of [[Cheetos]]. The series is set in the alternative universe of Soviet Unterzoegersdorf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adage.com/article/madisonvine-news/frito-lay-puts-cheetos-brand-bloggers-hands/134558 ''Frito-Lay Puts Cheetos Brand in Bloggers' Hands'', in "Ad Age", Michael Learmonth; February 11, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tjcnyc.wordpress.com/2009/02/04/cheetos-boingboing/ Tom Cunniff/iCPG, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psfk.com/2009/02/media-as-creative-agency-boing-boing-does-cheetos.html PSFK Agency, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chasnote.com/2009/02/04/cheetos-arrives-in-soviet-unterzoegersdorf/ Chas Edwards' blog, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Sudden Shower over Shin-Ōhashi bridge and Atake'''''|大はしあたけの夕立|''Ōhashi atake no yūdachi''}} is a woodblock print in the [[ukiyo-e]] genre by the Japanese artist [[Hiroshige]].  It was published in 1857 as part of the series ''[[One Hundred Famous Views of Edo]]'' and is one of the best known of Hiroshige's prints.&lt;ref name='In Tokyo'&gt;{{cite book |last=Bicknell |first=Julian |date=1994 |title=Hiroshige in Tokyo: The Floating World of Edo |location=London |publisher=New England Editions Limited |page=118 |isbn=1-56640-803-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-known variant state of this print, the variant owned by [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]], is in fact a later state. The first state depicted an additional two boats, a different background, less angular rain, and a carving error in the pylons that was corrected by handpainting.

==''One Hundred Famous Views of Edo''==
The picture is part of the series ''[[One Hundred Famous Views of Edo]]'' which actually features 119 views of 'named places' or 'celebrated spots' in the area that is today [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/research/edo/places/ Brooklyn Museum - Research: Hiroshige's One Hundread Famous Views of Edo: Famous Places of Edo]&lt;/ref&gt; The series was unique in being the first to feature this many separate landscape views.&lt;ref name="brooklyn2"&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/research/edo/places/ Research: Hiroshige's One Hundread Famous Views of Edo: Famous Places of Edo]&lt;/ref&gt;
The series was produced between 1856 and 1859 with [[Hiroshige II]] finishing the series after the death of Hiroshige in 1858. This print was published in the [[Japanese calendar|ninth month]] of 1857.&lt;ref name="brooklyn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; The series was commissioned shortly after the [[1855 Edo earthquake]] and subsequent fires and featured many of the newly rebuilt or repaired buildings. The prints may have commemorated or helped draw Edo's citizens attention to the progress of the rebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://honolulumuseum.org/art/exhibitions/11559-good_news_hiroshige_new_interpretation_series_one_hundred_famous_views_edo/ Good News from Hiroshige: A New Interpretation of the Series “One Hundred Famous Views of Edo”]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Shinohashi bridge Tokyo.jpg|thumb|left|The modern Shinohashi bridge in Tokyo in a very similar location to the old bridge.]]
The print shows a small part of the wooden ''Ōhashi'' (Great) bridge diagonally across the foreground of the image as the bridge crosses the [[Sumida River]]. In the background is a boatman punting his log raft towards the Fukagawa timber yards, looking for shelter.&lt;ref name="brooklyn"&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/121666/Sudden_Shower_Over_Shin-Ohashi_Bridge_and_Atake_Ohashi_Atake_no_Yudachi_No._58_from_One_Hundred_Famous_Views_of_Edo Sudden Shower Over Shin-Ohashi Bridge and Atake (Ohashi Atake no Yudachi), No. 58 from One Hundred Famous Views of Edo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='In Tokyo'/&gt;&lt;ref name="artwolf"/&gt; Also seen is the far bank of the river in a part of Edo known as ''Atake'' after the government ship, the ''Atakemaru'' that was moored there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/08533/artifact_aspx_id_1074.html Ohashi bridge, evening shower in Atake]&lt;/ref&gt; Two women and four or five men are shown crossing the bridge sheltering under hats, umbrellas or straw capes from a sudden shower of rain.&lt;ref name='In Tokyo'/&gt; Sudden showers are a recurring theme in ukiyo-e works and here in what Hiroshige calls "white rain"&lt;ref name="artwolf"&gt;[http://www.theartwolf.com/masterworks/hiroshige.htm 'Oshashi Bridge &amp; Atake in a suden shower']&lt;/ref&gt; are depicted using a large number of thin dark parallel lines in 2 directions - a difficult skill in woodblock printing.&lt;ref name="met"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/55433?rpp=30&amp;pg=1&amp;ft=hiroshige&amp;pos=24 Sudden Shower over Shin-Ōhashi Bridge and Atake (Ōhashi Atake no yūdachi), from the series One Hundred Famous Views of Edo (Meisho Edo hyakkei)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.transparent.com/japanese/hiroshige/ Japanese Language Blog - Hiroshige]&lt;/ref&gt; At the top of the print are dark clouds from which the rain emanates, these are produced using a [[Bokashi (printing)|
bokashi]] technique, another difficult printing technique, and vary significantly between prints. Other bokashi areas seen in some prints are the water around the bridge and the bridge's roadway.&lt;ref name='In Tokyo'/&gt; The rain, sheltering people and log raft at the centre of the image give the image a sense of movement.&lt;ref name="artwolf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://terimakasih.cc/gallery/ukiyoe.html Ukiyoe]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridges have been sited at that same location since 1694. The wooden bridge depicted in the print was replaced by another bridge in 1885, completed in 1912 and later moved to a new site elsewhere. The current bridge at the site was erected in 1973.

Hiroshige's most popular prints were produced in the tens of thousands at a low individual cost and due to the [[Bakumatsu|opening up of Japan]] after 1853 were popular both in Japan and Europe where they had a [[Japonism|huge influence]] on the future [[Impressionist]] artists.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3669308/Hiroshige-Master-printmaker-still-making-waves.html Hiroshige: Master printmaker still making waves]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Japonisme"&gt;{{cite book |author1=G.P.

He used for example non-Western [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] in the siting of the bridges, sometimes using no detailed foreground or background objects, scurrying undetailed people on the bridges, large area of [[negative space]] and the odd boat on the river.&lt;ref name="Japonisme"/&gt; The theme of scurrying people sheltering from the weather under umbrellas that is typical of ''One Hundred Views of Edo'' was an influence on [[Félix Buhot]]'s ''Le Petit Enterrement'' and Hiroshige's high horizons, areas of blue wash and strong foreground imagery with lack of middle ground influenced [[Auguste-Louis Lepère]]'s prints such as ''La Convalescente: Madame Lepère''.&lt;ref name="Japonisme"/&gt;

[[File:Hiroshige Van Gogh 2.JPG|thumb|left|400px|Hiroshige's original woodblock print and Van Gogh's copy in oil]]
[[Vincent van Gogh]] was a major collector of Japanese prints,&lt;ref name="VGG"&gt;[http://blog.vangoghgallery.com/index.php/2013/01/08/van-gogh-and-japanese-art-part-1/ Van Gogh and Japanese Art, Part 1 - The Bridge in the Rain (after Hiroshige) &amp; Flowering Plum Tree (after Hiroshige)]&lt;/ref&gt; decorating his studio with them. [[Japonaiserie (Van Gogh)|He was heavily influenced by these prints]], particularly Hiroshige, and made copies of two of the ''One Hundred Famous Views of Edo'', ''[[Plum Park in Kameido]]'' and this one. He made these copies in order to try out for himself elements he admired such as the cropped composition, blocks of colour with strong outlines and diagonal elements.&lt;ref name="VGM"/&gt;
Van Gogh's painting used brighter colours with greater contrast than the original, conspicuous brushstrokes rather than areas of flat colour, and was also framed with a selection of Van Gogh's approximations to Japanese characters.&lt;ref name="VGG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VGM"&gt;[http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0114V1962 Bridge in the Rain (after Hiroshige)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hiroshige's print was listed by ''[[The Observer]]''{{'}}s art critic Laura Cumming as one of the 10 best skies in art.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/mar/11/10-best-skies-art-in-pictures The 10 best... skies in art]&lt;/ref&gt;

The composer [[Geoffrey Poole]] produced the work ''Crossing Ohashi Bridge'' for the [[Goldberg Ensemble]] and named after Hiroshige's print.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmcrec.co.uk/recording/goldberg-ensemble-crossing-ohashi-bridge]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Distinguish|Symmetric group}}
{{about|the abstract algebraic structures}}

[[File:Tetrahedral group 2.svg|thumb|right|300px|A [[tetrahedron]] is invariant under 12 distinct [[rotation]]s, reflections excluded. These are illustrated here in the [[Cycle graph (algebra)|cycle graph]] format, along with the 180° edge (blue arrows) and 120° vertex (reddish arrows) [[rotation]]s that [[permutation|permute]] the tetrahedron through the positions. The 12 rotations form the '''rotation (symmetry) group''' of the figure.]]

In [[group theory]], the '''symmetry group''' of an object ([[image]], [[Signal (information theory)|signal]], etc.) is the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of all [[Transformation (geometry)|transformation]]s under which the object is [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] with [[Function composition|composition]] as the group operation. For a space with a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], it is a [[subgroup]] of the [[isometry group]] of the space concerned. If not stated otherwise, this article considers [[symmetry]] groups in [[Euclidean geometry]], but the concept may also be studied in more general contexts as expanded below.

==Introduction==
The "objects" may be geometric figures, images, and patterns, such as a [[wallpaper group|wallpaper pattern]]. The definition can be made more precise by specifying what is meant by image or pattern, e.g., a function of position with values in a set of colors. For symmetry of physical objects, one may also want to take their physical composition into account. The group of isometries of space induces a [[group action]] on objects in it.

The symmetry group is sometimes also called '''full symmetry group''' in order to emphasize that it includes the orientation-reversing isometries (like reflections, [[glide reflection]]s and [[improper rotation]]s) under which the figure is invariant. The [[subgroup]] of orientation-preserving isometries (i.e. translations, rotations, and compositions of these) that leave the figure invariant is called its '''proper symmetry group'''.  The proper symmetry group of an object is equal to its full symmetry group [[if and only if]] the object is [[chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] (and thus there are no [[Orientation (vector space)|orientation]]-reversing isometries under which it is invariant).

Any symmetry group whose elements have a common [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]], which is true for all finite symmetry groups and also for the symmetry groups of bounded figures, can be represented as a [[subgroup]] of the [[orthogonal group]] O(''n'') by choosing the origin to be a fixed point. The proper symmetry group is then a subgroup of the special orthogonal group SO(''n''), and is therefore also called '''rotation group''' of the figure.

A '''discrete symmetry group''' is a symmetry group such that for every point of the space the set of images of the point under the isometries in the symmetry group is a [[discrete set]]. The number of elements in the group may be either finite or infinite.

Discrete symmetry groups come in three types: (1) finite '''[[point groups]]''', which include only rotations, reflections, inversion and rotoinversion – they are just the finite subgroups of O(''n''), (2) infinite '''[[Lattice (group)|lattice]] groups''', which include only translations, and (3) infinite '''[[space groups]]''' which combines elements of both previous types, and may also include extra transformations like [[screw displacement]]s and [[glide reflection]]s. There are also ''continuous'' symmetry groups, which contain rotations of arbitrarily small angles or translations of arbitrarily small distances.  The group of all symmetries of a sphere [[orthogonal group|O(3)]] is an example of this, and in general such [[continuous symmetry]] groups are studied as [[Lie group]]s. With a  [[Euclidean group#Subgroups|categorization of subgroups of the Euclidean group]] corresponds a categorization of symmetry groups.

Two geometric figures are considered to be of the same symmetry type if their symmetry groups are conjugate subgroups of the [[Euclidean group]] E(''n'') (the isometry group of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;), where two subgroups ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of a group ''G'' are ''[[Conjugacy class#Conjugacy of subgroups and general subsets|conjugate]]'', if there exists {{nowrap|''g'' ∈ ''G''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''g''}}. For example:
*two 3D figures have mirror symmetry, but with respect to different mirror planes.
*two 3D figures have 3-fold [[rotational symmetry]], but with respect to different axes.
*two 2D patterns have translational symmetry, each in one direction; the two translation vectors have the same length but a different direction.

When considering isometry groups, one may restrict oneself to those where for all points the set of images under the isometries is [[Closed (topology)|topologically closed]]. This includes all discrete isometry groups and also those involved in continuous symmetries, but excludes for example in 1D the group of translations by a rational number. A "figure" with this symmetry group is non-drawable and up to arbitrarily fine detail homogeneous, without being really homogeneous.

==One dimension==
The isometry groups in one dimension where for all points the set of images under the isometries is [[Closed (topology)|topologically closed]] are:
*the trivial group C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
*the groups of two elements generated by a reflection in a point; they are isomorphic with C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
*the infinite discrete groups generated by a translation; they are isomorphic with Z, the additive group of the integers
*the infinite discrete groups generated by a translation and a reflection in a point; they are isomorphic with the [[Dihedral group#Generalizations|generalized dihedral group]] of Z,  Dih(Z), also denoted by D&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; (which is a [[semidirect product]] of Z and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). 
*the group generated by all translations (isomorphic with the additive group of the real numbers '''R'''); this group cannot be the symmetry group of a "pattern": it would be homogeneous, hence could also be reflected. However, a uniform one-dimensional vector field has this symmetry group.
*the group generated by all translations and reflections in points; they are isomorphic with the [[Dihedral group#Generalizations|generalized dihedral group]] of '''R''',  Dih('''R''').

See also [[symmetry groups in one dimension]].

==Two dimensions==

[[Up to]] conjugacy the discrete point groups in two-dimensional space are the following classes:

*[[cyclic group]]s C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ... where C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; consists of all rotations about a fixed point by multiples of the angle 360°/''n''
*[[dihedral group]]s D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[Dihedral group of order 6|D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Examples of groups#A symmetry group|D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], ..., where D&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (of order 2''n'') consists of the rotations in C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; together with reflections in ''n'' axes that pass through the fixed point.

C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[trivial group]] containing only the identity operation, which occurs when the figure has no symmetry at all, for example the letter '''F'''. C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the symmetry group of the letter '''Z''', C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that of a [[triskelion]], C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of a [[swastika]], and C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. are the symmetry groups of similar swastika-like figures with five, six, etc. arms instead of four.

D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the 2-element group containing the identity operation and a single reflection, which occurs when the figure has only a single axis of [[reflection symmetry|bilateral symmetry]], for example the letter '''A'''.

D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is isomorphic to the [[Klein four-group]], is the symmetry group of a non-equilateral rectangle. This figure has four symmetry operations: the identity operation, one twofold axis of rotation, and two nonequivalent mirror planes.

D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; etc. are the symmetry groups of the [[regular polygon]]s.

The actual symmetry groups in each of these cases have two [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] for the center of rotation, and in the case of the dihedral groups, one more for the positions of the mirrors.

The remaining isometry groups in two dimensions with a fixed point, where for all points the set of images under the isometries is topologically closed are:
*the special [[orthogonal group]] SO(2) consisting of all rotations about a fixed point; it is also called  the [[circle group]] S&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the multiplicative group of [[complex number]]s of [[absolute value]] 1. It is the ''proper'' symmetry group of a circle and the continuous equivalent of C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. There is no geometric figure that has as ''full'' symmetry group the circle group, but for a vector field it may apply (see the three-dimensional case below). 
*the orthogonal group O(2) consisting of all rotations about a fixed point and reflections in any axis through that fixed point. This is the symmetry group of a circle. It is also called Dih(S&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) as it is the [[dihedral group|generalized dihedral group]] of S&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

For non-bounded figures, the additional isometry groups can include translations; the closed ones are:
*the 7 [[frieze group]]s 
*the 17 [[wallpaper group]]s
*for each of the symmetry groups in one dimension, the combination of all symmetries in that group in one direction, and the group of all translations in the perpendicular direction
*ditto with also reflections in a line in the first direction.

==Three dimensions==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Bipyramid]] --&gt;
{{see also|Point groups in three dimensions}}

[[Up to]] conjugacy the set of three-dimensional point groups consists of 7 infinite series, and 7 separate ones. In crystallography they are restricted to be compatible with the discrete translation symmetries of a crystal lattice. This [[crystallographic restriction theorem|crystallographic restriction]] of the infinite families of general point groups results in 32 crystallographic point groups (27 from the 7 infinite series, and 5 of the 7 others).

The continuous symmetry groups with a fixed point include those of:
*cylindrical symmetry without a symmetry plane perpendicular to the axis, this applies for example often for a [[bottle]]
*cylindrical symmetry with a symmetry plane perpendicular to the axis
*spherical symmetry

For objects and [[scalar field]]s the cylindrical symmetry implies vertical planes of reflection. However, for [[vector field]]s it does not: in [[cylindrical coordinates]] with respect to some axis,  
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = A_\rho\boldsymbol{\hat \rho} + A_\phi\boldsymbol{\hat \phi} + A_z\boldsymbol{\hat z}&lt;/math&gt; has cylindrical symmetry with respect to the axis [[if and only if]] &lt;math&gt;A_\rho, A_\phi,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; A_z&lt;/math&gt; have this symmetry, i.e., they do not depend on &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Additionally there is reflectional symmetry if and only if &lt;math&gt;A_\phi = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

For spherical symmetry there is no such distinction, it implies planes of reflection.

The continuous symmetry groups without a fixed point include those with a [[screw axis]], such as an infinite [[helix]]. See also [[Euclidean group#Subgroups|subgroups of the Euclidean group]].

==Symmetry groups in general==
{{see also|Automorphism}}
In wider contexts, a '''symmetry group''' may be any kind of '''transformation group''', or [[automorphism]] group. Once we know what kind of [[mathematical structure]] we are concerned with, we should be able to pinpoint what [[Map (mathematics)|mappings]] preserve the structure. Conversely, specifying the symmetry can define the structure, or at least clarify what we mean by an [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]], geometric language in which to discuss it; this is one way of looking at the [[Erlangen programme]].

For example, automorphism groups of certain models of [[finite geometry|finite geometries]] are not "symmetry groups" in the usual sense, although they preserve symmetry.  They do this by preserving ''families'' of point-sets rather than point-sets (or "objects") themselves.

Like above, the group of automorphisms of space induces a [[group action]] on objects in it.

For a given geometric figure in a given geometric space, consider the following equivalence relation: two automorphisms of space are equivalent [[if and only if]] the two images of the figure are the same (here "the same" does not mean something like e.g. "the same up to translation and rotation", but it means "exactly the same"). Then the equivalence class of the identity is the symmetry group of the figure, and every equivalence class corresponds to one isomorphic version of the figure.

There is a bijection between every pair of equivalence classes: the inverse of a representative of the first equivalence class, composed with a representative of the second.

In the case of a finite automorphism group of the whole space, its order is the order of the symmetry group of the figure multiplied by the number of isomorphic versions of the figure.

Examples:
*Isometries of the Euclidean plane, the figure is a rectangle: there are infinitely many equivalence classes; each contains 4 isometries.
*The space is a [[cube]] with Euclidean metric; the figures include cubes of the same size as the space, with colors or patterns on the faces; the automorphisms of the space are the 48 isometries; the figure is a cube of which one face has a different color; the figure has a symmetry group of 8 isometries, there are 6 equivalence classes of 8 isometries, for 6 isomorphic versions of the figure.

Compare [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)]] and its proof.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5124">'''"Symphony No. 1 in 20 Keys ("Letter to the World")"''' is a five-movement [[Polytonality|polytonal]] [[symphony]] for large orchestra written in 2014 by [[Matthew de Lacey Davidson]].  Its total duration is approximately 35 minutes.

==Background==
To date, with one exception, all of Davidson's other orchestral works were adaptations or orchestrations of his own works, or those of others (most notably, [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] and [[Robert Schumann]]).  This symphony is the first large scale, full-length orchestral work in Davidson's catalogue of compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Matthew [http://composers.com/node/11619 "Entry for SYMPHONY No. 1 in 20 Keys", ''American Composers Alliance'']. Retrieved on 16 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
Symphony No. 1 in 20 keys is written for the following cominbation of instruments: 2 piccolos (3,4 FL doubling), 4 Flutes, 3 Oboes, Cor Anglais, Alto Sax in Eb, Eb soprano clarinet (clarinet 3 doubles), 3 Bb Clarinets, Bass Clarinet, 3 Bassoons, 1 Contrabassoon, 8 Horns in F, 4 Trumpets in C, 2 Tenor Trombones, 1 Bass Trombone, Tuba, Timpani, Percussion 1 &amp; 2 (Glockenspiel, Xylophone, Vibraphone, Marimba, Tubular Bells, Wind Chimes, Triangle, Sleigh Bells, Cymbals, Cowbell, Tam-tam, Slapstick, Ratchet, Guiro, Snare Drum, Bass Drum), Celesta, two harps, Soprano, Mezzo-Soprano, Tenor, Bass-Baritone, Strings in divisi (violins I &amp; II, violas, violoncellos, contrabass).&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Matthew [http://composers.com/node/11619 "Entry for SYMPHONY No. 1 in 20 Keys", ''American Composers Alliance'']. Retrieved on 16 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the composer's notes, Symphony No. 1 in 20 keys is the first symphony to cast the outer movements as scherzi.  As in most of Davidson's music, every movement in the work uses melodies which are taken from transcribed non-western or "vernacular" melodies.  Movement I is a modified mirror-shape, Movement II is a sonata form, Movement III is a series of variations on an original melody inspired by “fado” songs of Portugal.  Each variation is titled by various musical forms, such as Faburden, Canto Carnascialescho, Freistimmigkeit, Menuet, Gigue, Sarabande, and Quodlibet.  Movement IV is a chorale in five sections for soprano, mezzo-soprano, tenor, and bass-baritone which employ settings of poems by [[Emily Dickinson]].  Movement V is a rounded binary form using a Scottish folk and Russian folk melody (the latter is accompanied by a [[Renaissance]] song by [[Ockeghem]] - which provides the title of that movement).&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Matthew [https://www.musiccentre.ca/node/125117 "Entry for SYMPHONY No. 1 in 20 Keys", ''Canadian Music Centre'']. Retrieved on August 27 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole symphony uses transcribed melodies (or melodies suggested) from the following sources:

*1. Musique et Musiciens du Monde - Biélorussie (UNESCO); Kazakh Music Today (Topic Records Inc.)
*2. Children’s Songs from Spain / Karen James &amp; Isabelita Alonso / Folkways Records (LP)
*3. Renaissance Lute Music – Lorenzino del Liuto / Naxos Recordings (CD)
*4. Chansons de Breton – Dalc’h Sonj, sung by Mona Kerys / Marianne Mélodie (CD)
*5. Afghanistan: Female Musicians of Heart – Bibi gol arus, sung by Zainab Herawi / Musical Heritage (CD)
*6. Folk Voices: Finnish Folk Song Through the Ages / based on performances by Tellu and Pia Rask / Ondine (CD)
*7. Rough Guide to Scottish Music, Second Edition - Cailleach An Airgid performed by Cliar / World Music Network (CD)
*8. УЛИЧНАЯ from 65 Russian Folk Songs (Prokunin, Vasily) (book published in 1898)&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Matthew [http://composers.com/node/11619 "Entry for SYMPHONY No. 1 in 20 Keys", ''American Composers Alliance'']. Retrieved on 16 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout all five movements, there is a continuously developed and alternating use of four keys, all employed simultaneously, which provides an effect similar to "[[modal mixture]]" found in some renaissance music.

'''''The Color of Friendship''''' is a 2000 [[television film]] based on actual events about the friendship between two girls; Mahree &amp; Piper, one from the [[United States]] and the other from [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]], who learn about tolerance and friendship.&lt;ref name="disney"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-06-01 
|publisher=Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was directed by [[Kevin Hooks]], based on a script by [[Paris Qualles]], and stars [[Lindsey Haun]] and [[Shadia Simmons]].

==Plot==
In 1977, [[Piper Dellums]] ([[Shadia Simmons]]) is a black girl who lives in [[Washington, D.C.]] with her father, Congressman [[Ron Dellums]] ([[Carl Lumbly]]), an outspoken opponent of the South African [[apartheid]] system and the oppression of black South Africans, her mother Roscoe Dellums ([[Penny Johnson Jerald|Penny Johnson]]), and two younger twin brothers, Brandon (Anthony Burnett) and [[Erik Dellums|Erik]] (Travis Davis). Piper, who has been taking an interest in the different nations of Africa, begs her parents to host an African exchange student.

Meanwhile, in South Africa, Mahree Bok ([[Lindsey Haun]]) is a [[white South African]] who lives in a [[manor]] house with her parents and little brother. They comfortably benefit from the system of [[apartheid]] without questioning its morality; Mahree's father, Pieter Bok, is a South African [[policeman]] who cannot hide his joy when [[Steve Biko]] (a black South African man fighting against apartheid) has just been captured. They also have a black [[maid]], Flora ([[Melanie Nicholls-King]]), whom Mahree, in her racial blindness, considers her best friend, not realizing that Flora is not satisfied with her life under [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]]. However, Mahree's observation is not entirely wrong, as Flora is a kindly woman who is indeed friendly with the Bok children, believing that gentleness and persuasion work better than agitation. Flora tells Mahree that when she was a little girl she would observe the weaver bird, which has many different styles of plumage, and its communal nest-building, which is used as a metaphor for the possibility of racial harmony that Mahree does not understand at the time. Mahree also asks her parents for permission to study in America, which is granted by her father, who believes she will either get homesick or realize that America is not a paradise. However, Mahree is slightly aware of some of the injustices of her society, as a black busboy gets slugged for spilling a tray, which she finds revolting.

Both Mahree and Piper have misconstrued notions about each other's countries: Mahree does not think that there are black politicians, only knowing the patriarch of her host family is "Congressman Dellums", and although Piper is expecting a South African exchange student, she does not realize there are white residents.

Their assumptions are not corrected until Piper and her mother meet Mahree at the airport and bring her home. Piper is bitterly disappointed. Mahree reacts with horror bordering on panic when confronted with this new situation, as does Ron. Piper goes to his office where he is meeting with several black Congressmen, and they all look surprised to see that he will be hosting a white South African.  Once Mahree gets back to the Dellums' house, she locks herself in Piper's bedroom and refuses to come out.

Eventually, Piper picks the lock on the door to bring Mahree some fries and a chocolate shake. Mahree is standoffish, and Piper, upset by her attitude, tells Mahree how disappointed she is in her. Stunned by this, Mahree sees how rude she's been, and agrees to stay and try to make this work. Roscoe tries to play peacemaker, chalking up Mahree's reaction to misunderstanding and culture shock, while telling Ron and Piper they have been judgmental as well. Everyone tries to make this work out.

During Mahree's stay, she and the Dellumses grow close. Mahree sees people of different races getting along and realizes how much she and Piper have in common. The two become good friends. Mahree also begins to see her host family as individuals and learns to live among them day to day. Gradually, she develops a better understanding of what life under South African apartheid must be like for people of color.

When Steve Biko dies under suspicious circumstances in the custody of South African police, there are mass protests around the world, including at the South African embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]]  In the wake of these protests, South African embassy diplomats arrive at the Dellums' house and take Mahree to the embassy, intending to send her back to South Africa.

In response, Ron goes to the South African embassy.  After he threatens to tell the press that the embassy kidnapped Mahree from her host family, the embassy releases Mahree. Mahree returns to the Dellumses without fully understanding what happened to her and why.

When Mahree returns to the Dellums' house, she makes a cold offhand comment about Biko's death.  Outraged, Piper shouts at her for being blind to the racial struggle happening in South Africa. Hurt, Mahree runs from the house. At first, it seems that their friendship is over; but Piper's parents soon bridge the gap between the girls. In private, Ron tells Mahree that the United States had a long, hard history of trying to overcome problems, which is what South Africa is doing now, and she finally fully grasps what the liberation fighters in South Africa stand for. She and Piper reconcile.

Soon, Mahree leaves the United States, now a very different person. When she returns home, the first person she greets is Flora.  Secretly, Mahree shows her an [[African National Congress|ANC]] flag sewn inside her coat, signifying her decision to side with the black liberation movement. Flora is touched and pleased.

An epilogue-like scene at the end of the movie shows Mahree with the Dellumses at an African pride event back in America. Ron Dellums delivers a speech that includes the weaver-bird story, as told to him by "a new friend from South Africa."

==Reception==
Lynne Heffley of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' praised the cast and called the film "surprisingly compelling", and stated that while it is "frequently predictable", it "delves unexpectedly deeper, too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Heffley |first=Lynne |title=A Compelling 'Friendship' |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/feb/05/entertainment/ca-61188 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 5, 2000 |accessdate=September 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Kronke of ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'' noted that the film did an "admirably handy job" of educating children about apartheid, and called it a "thoughtful, entertaining family film that tackles its issues matter-of-factly and directly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kronke |first=David |title=Tried the Best?

Scott Hetrick of the ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'' called the film "entertaining and enlightening," stating that it had a "terrific story that is wonderfully told and thoroughly fulfilling."&lt;ref name=Sun/&gt; ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' wrote that the film "breaks the nauseatingly simple 'after-school special' mold of most child-friendly teleflicks" and that it "is certainly one of the better films you'll see on the channel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Disney Channel brings world of prejudice to light |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000204&amp;slug=4003103 |work=The Seattle Times |date=February 4, 2000 |accessdate=September 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Schultz of ''[[New York Daily News]]'' wrote that the film "grapples with apartheid head on, yet incorporates it into an engrossing, and touching, family story." Schultz further wrote that the "changes of heart" between Mahree and the Dellums family are "most affecting" and that the "story and the human dynamics here are so inherently dramatic that the heartfelt script seems to write itself. The performances are wonderful, and when politics arise it seems natural."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schultz |first=Paul |title=Apartheid's Visit Rouses a Fine 'Friendship' |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/nydn-features/apartheid-visit-rouses-fine-friendship-article-1.866363 |work=New York Daily News |date=January 30, 2000 |accessdate=September 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page stated, "It's totally fair that ''The Color of Friendship'' is one of the most lauded installments in the Disney franchise," writing that the film features a "comparatively unflinching look at race relations" and that it "scores extra points for refusing to shy away from the more difficult sides of racism, making sure to drive home the harsh realities of racially-motivated violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/disney-channel-original-movies-ranked/|title=Every Disney Channel Original Movie, Ranked|last=Page|first=Aubrey|date=May 26, 2016|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609054515/http://collider.com/disney-channel-original-movies-ranked/|archivedate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; That month, Ariana Bacle of ''Entertainment Weekly'' wrote that Disney Channel "took a risk by unapologetically making a completely necessary albeit heavy statement about prejudice with one of their kid-focused films, and it was well worth it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=30 Disney Channel Original Movies, Ranked|url=https://www.ew.com/gallery/disney-channel-original-movies-dcoms-ranking/2372623_4-brink/#17-the-color-of-friendship|accessdate=September 5, 2018|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
On John Conroy's property, the 2-year-old colts and fillies are mustered and brought to the homestead for [[horse breaking]]. Two of the colts are of very good stock, especially the beautiful and spirited colt from the famous racehorse Regret (John Conroy says that the colt is worth a thousand pounds (£1000) and that he wants the colt to eventually be the [[Stud (animal)|stud]] horse for the property).

Jim Ryan arrives at John Conroy's property following the death of his father. When he and Conroy's daughter, Kate, see each other, it is love at first sight for them both.

Jim, however, finds resentment at his presence at the [[Station (Australian agriculture)|station]], both from John Conroy, the owner of the property, and the station's [[Stockman (Australia)|stockmen]] and [[Station (Australian agriculture)#Personnel|station hands]], with Dan Mulligan (the leading hand), disdainfully commenting "''We don't want any [[Swagman|swagmen]] here''". Saltbush and McGinness McGee also make [[Wiktionary:disparaging|disparaging]] remarks about Jim Ryan's horse, with Saltbush sarcastically asking Jim if he bought his horse from a [[Mark Foy's]] catalogue, and McGinness McGee commenting that it was more likely that the horse had been saved from a [[Animal glue|glue factory]].

John Conroy also comments that they have enough men working on the property already. Kate pleads with her father to give Jim a job at the property, and he finally relents, saying that Jim can help break the horses. John Conroy resents it when Jim Ryan says that he knows of a better way to break horses than the horse-breaking method being used at the property. However, John Conroy says that Jim could prove his expertise in horse-breaking by breaking the colt from Regret.

During the night, the [[Brumby]] herd gallops close to the homestead, and the colt from Regret breaks free from his tethers and joins them. John Conroy is furious at the loss of his prized colt, and unfairly blames Jim for what has occurred. Conroy decides to get all the crack riders (expert horse riders) from the stations near and far to muster at the homestead and hunt for the Brumbies, offering a reward of £1000, and angrily orders Jim to leave the property first thing in the morning.

The crack riders gather at the homestead the following morning, including Harrison, who made his fortune when Pardon won the cup (a reference to the President's Cup, a lesser known race held in Manindie, New South Wales). Another crack rider at the homestead was [[Clancy of the Overflow]] (who was a friend of Jim). Jim shyly turns up to join in the ride to hunt for the colt and Brumbies, but finds that, apart from his friend, Clancy, he is not wanted by anyone on the ride. Clancy convinces the others that, as both Jim and his horse were mountain-reared, they would be of great help in the ride.

The Brumbies are too quick for the riders and, when it becomes too steep and dangerous with [[wombat]] holes (burrows, where a horse could break a leg), all riders stop short of the dangerous descent &amp;mdash; apart from Jim, who continues to chase the Brumby herd - finally bringing the herd (including the colt) back to John Conroy's property.

John Conroy is delighted to have his colt back again, and gives his approval to Jim marrying Kate. A concert and country dance, as well as a superb [[equestrianism|equestrian]] pageant, are then held in celebration and recognition of Jim's deed, and all ends happily.

===Screen images===
* The screen images, photographed by Ross Dunstan, were provided by [[Australian Geographic|Australian Geographic Pty Ltd]] and are featured in their book ''The Snowy Mountains''.

===Poetry===
* [[Steve Bisley]], in his role of [[Banjo Paterson|Banjo]], recites [[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|the poem]] during Act II in the scene "The Ride &amp;mdash; parts 1&amp;ndash;4", as well as reciting other poems by Banjo Paterson. [[Bud Tingwell]], in his role of "John Conroy", also recited poems by Banjo Paterson.

===Horses, riders and drivers===
* ''The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular'' had real horses performing in the show.
* During the opening sequence of ''The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular'', [[Steve Jefferys]] and his stock horse Ammo reprised their entrance at the beginning of the [[2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|Sydney 2000 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony]]. Steve Jeffreys' wife Sandra Langsford also took part in both the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony (in which she was one of the 140 riders) and also took part in ''The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular'', in which she was one of the featured crack riders (expert riders). Steve Jefferys and Sandra Langsford also trained Ammo (the rearing horse), and Drummond (the colt from old Regret), as well as training Jana, the Border Collie (Banjo Paterson's dog).
* For his horse riding role as Jim Ryan in the production of ''The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular'', [[Martin Crewes]], who could already ride, was given intensive riding lessons by expert riding teacher [[Steve Jefferys]], so that Crewes would not require a [[body double]] for the difficult riding feats he had to accomplish in the show. Jefferys also taught Crewes the difficult art of being a [[horse whisperer]] for his role as Jim Ryan. Horse whispering usually takes years to learn, but Crewes was able to master this difficult skill in only two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;''Outside the Arena &amp;ndash; Behind the Scenes'' &amp;mdash; extras section of the DVD release of the show&lt;/ref&gt;
* There was also superb riding, including intricate [[equestrianism|equestrian]] drill movements, and all of the animal actors ('Jana' the Border Collie, and the horses in the show) were magnificent. [[Horse riding stunts]] in the show were performed by trick riders and stunt riders, including Zelie Thompson and Deborah Brennan. The crack riders in the musical wore [[Akubra]] hats and [[Driza-Bone]] riding coats.
* The Horse Master for the show was Tony Jablonski, who had also been the Horse Master for the horse segment at the beginning of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony.
* A [[Cobb and Co]] stagecoach, pulled by five horses, was featured in the musical.
* Also featured were a couple of buckboards, with one of the buckboards being pulled by a mare, while the second buckboard was pulled by a gelding (the buckboard horses, which were very similar in colouring, though different in size, were mother and son).

===Whipcracking and ropes===
* Australia's [[whipcracking]] expert [[John Brady (showman)|John Brady]] demonstrated his expertise with both [[stockwhip]]s and rope tricks within the show, as well as appearing in the show in the role of Saltbush.

'''''The Merciful Knight''''' is a watercolour by the [[pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[Edward Burne-Jones]] which was completed in 1863 and is currently housed at the [[Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;See the BM&amp;AG webpages on this work [http://www.bmagic.org.uk/objects/1973P84].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This picture is based on an 11th-century legend retold by [[Sir Kenelm Digby]] in ''Broadstone of Honour'', its hero is a [[Florence|Florentine]] [[knight]] named [[John Gualbert]] (an anglicisation of [[Giovanni Gualberto]]). The explanatory inscription provided by Burne-Jones tells the viewer ''of a knight who forgave his enemy when he might have destroyed him and how the image of Christ kissed him in token that his acts had pleased God.''&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Frantzen, ''Chivalry, Sacrifice &amp; The Great War: The Medieval Contexts of Edward Burne-Jones "The Miracle of the Merciful Knight"'' (from 'Speaking Images. Essays in Honor of V.A. Kolve'). Pegasus Press (20010, pp. 618–625.&lt;/ref&gt; 

John Gualbert&lt;sup&gt;([[#See_also|see image below]])&lt;/sup&gt; was an Italian Roman Catholic saint, the founder of the [[Vallumbrosan Order]]. He was a member of the Visdomini family of [[Florence|Florentine]] nobility. One [[Good Friday]] he was entering [[Florence]] accompanied by armed followers, when in a narrow lane he came upon a man who had killed his brother. He was about to kill the man in revenge, when the other fell upon his knees with arms outstretched in the form of a cross and begged for mercy in the name of Christ, who had been crucified on that day. John forgave him. He entered the Benedictine Church at [[San Miniato]] to pray, and the figure on the crucifix bowed its head to him in recognition of his generosity. John Gualbert was later canonised.

This arguably being Burne-Jones's most important early work,&lt;ref&gt;In the memorial biography of her husband, Georgiana Burne-Jones stated that it seemed: 'to sum up and seal the ten years that had passed since Edward first went to Oxford'. Cf. information at BM&amp;AG website [http://www.bmagic.org.uk/objects/1973P84]&lt;/ref&gt; it demonstrates a new and more personal style, evident in its design, technique and expression. It remained Burne-Jones's own favourite among his early works: this interest in knights and [[chivalry]] was aroused when painting the Arthurian Oxford Union murals in 1863 and was to remain with him throughout his life. In 1894 he tried to borrow ''The Merciful Knight'' to make a large oil version, and he was actually working on ''[[The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon]]'' when he died in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;''The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon'' is owned by the Ponce Museum of Art in [[Puerto Rico]]. However, it was shown for a short time at the [[Tate Britain]] in London while the Ponce Museum underwent restoration in 2009–2010. The painting was also on view at the [http://www.museodelprado.es/ Prado Museum] in Madrid: ''The Sleeping Beauty. Victorian Painting from The Museo de Arte de Ponce'' (24 February 2009 – 31 May 2009). Cf. [[The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon|Wiki entry]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Burne-Jones preliminary sketches for ''The Merciful Knight'', the kiss given by Christ is far more passionate, with strong [[homoerotic]] overtones. In this finished version, painted in [[gouache]], the kiss became protective and deeply caring, without any sexual implications.&lt;ref&gt;F. MacCarthy, ''The Last Pre-Raphaelite: Edward Burne-Jones and the Victorian Imagination'', Faber and Faber (2011). See also entry for this painting, on C. Wood, ''Burne-Jones'', Phoenix Illustrated (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; The beard of Christ provides a shield over the knight's forehead and inexpressibly sad face; the wounds in Christ's hands draw attention to the vulnerability of the knight's exposed hands – whose armoured gauntlets hang from his waist. Incidentally, the [[Tagetes|marigolds]] in the foreground came from the 'town garden' in [[Russell Square]], close to Burne-Jones' house opposite the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;See BM&amp;AG note [http://bmag.onlinegalleries.com/metadot/index.pl?isa=Metadot::SystemApp::AntiqueSearch;op=detail;id=35716] and their paper at [http://www.schoolsliaison.org.uk/2004/bmag/resources/pre_raphs_web.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Yusuf Khan and Sherbano''''' is a famous [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] amorous [[Folklore|folktale]]. Its format is an extended narrative described as ''qissa'' or ''dastan'', and is listed along with ''[[Adam Khan and Durkhanai]]'', ''Ramadad Khan'' and ''Ajab Khan'' as important Pashto ''dastan'' which are available as [[chapbooks]] or in audio formats.&lt;ref&gt;Hanaway, William L. "Dastan" in Claus, Peter J., Sarah Diamond, and Margaret Ann Mills. South Asian Folklore: An Encyclopedia: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003. p143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaan2011"/&gt;

A famous version of the story was put to verse by poet [[Ali Haydar Joshi]] (Joshi was a pen name) in the 1960s and was turned into a film, ''[[Yousuf Khan Sher Bano]]'', released in 1969. The poem was translated into French by Benedict Johnson (in 1982) and into English by Heston and Nasir (in 1988). The story is transmitted by ''qissa-khwans'', a term usually translated as "storytellers" who "say" or "sing" (''Wayel'') the verses. Joshi's account of the origin of the material is that he found a manuscript containing the story written in [[Persian language|Persian]] at a local fair wrapped around some medicine. He returned to the seller and got more of the manuscript.&lt;ref name="Heston1994"&gt;Heston, Wilma L. ''Footpath Poets of Peshawar''. in Appadurai, Arjun, Frank J. Korom, and Margaret Ann Mills. Gender, genre, and power in South Asian expressive traditions. Motilal Banarsidass Publishe, 1994. p310-311, 326-327&lt;/ref&gt; Joshi's account is given in a Lok Virsa tape recorded by Mumtaz Nasir in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Heston, W. L. "Verse Narrative from the Bazaar of the Storytellers." Asian folklore studies (1986): 79-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story has supernatural elements, such as five holy men (''pirs'') who give the heroine the ability to travel large distance in thirty steps, [[jinn]]s who bring a woman and a bed to a mosque at night for the pleasure of a [[yogi]]. These elements suggest an influence to the story from outside [[Pathan]] culture. However, the social structures in the story, particularly the use as villains of paternal male cousins is typical to Pathan stories, and many Pathans of various social classes identify the story as one of their own, according to ethnologist Wilma L. Heston.&lt;ref name="Heston1994"/&gt;

==Film==

A film version of ''[[Yousuf Khan Sher Bano]]'' was produced by Nazir Hussain.1st Evergreen Pashto Movie Yousaf khan sherbano...Aziz Tabussam was the director of the film as shown in the film title but it is said he was basically hired as Pakhtoon translator where as the film actually directed by the Nazir hussain the producer of the film.{{clarify|date=March 2017}}
