'''Aesthetics''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|s|ˈ|θ|ɛ|t|ɪ|k|s|,_|i:|s|-}}) is a branch of [[philosophy]] that explores the nature of [[art]], [[beauty]], and [[taste (sociology)|taste]], with the creation and appreciation of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Aesthetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its more technical [[Epistemology|epistemological]] perspective, it is defined as the study of subjective and [[senses|sensori-emotional values]], sometimes called [[judgement|judgment]]s of [[Feeling|sentiment]] and taste.&lt;ref&gt;Zangwill, Nick. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/ Aesthetic Judgment]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', 02-28-2003/10-22-2007. Retrieved 07-24-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetics studies how artists imagine, create and perform works of art; how people use, enjoy, and criticize art; and what happens in their minds when they look at paintings, listen to music, or read poetry, and understand what they see and hear. It also studies how they feel about art—why they like some works and not others, and how art can affect their moods, beliefs, and attitude toward life.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Munro, "Aesthetics", The World Book Encyclopedia, Vol. 1, ed. A. Richard Harmet, et. al., (Chicago: Merchandise Mart Plaza, 1986), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, scholars in the field define aesthetics as "critical reflection on art, culture and [[nature]]".&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1998) p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/adx.18.2.27949030|title =  Review of ''ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AESTHETICS 4 vol.''

==Etymology==
The word ''aesthetic'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang |grc|αἰσθητικός}} (''aisthetikos'', meaning "esthetic, sensitive, sentient, pertaining to sense perception"), which in turn was derived from αἰσθάνομαι (''aisthanomai'', meaning "I perceive, feel, sense" and related to {{lang |grc|αἴσθησις}} (''aisthēsis'', "sensation").&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD |aesthetic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "aesthetics" was appropriated and coined with new meaning by the German philosopher [[Alexander Baumgarten]] in his dissertation ''Meditationes philosophicae de nonnullis ad poema pertinentibus'' ("Philosophical considerations of some matters pertaining the poem") in 1735;&lt;ref name= "Guyer 2005"&gt;{{cite book |last = Guyer |first =Paul |title= Values of Beauty: Historical Essays in Aesthetics |date= 13 June 2005 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 0-521-60669-1 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Bje-QgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Baumgarten chose "aesthetics" because he wished to emphasize the experience of art as a means of knowing. Aesthetics, a not very tidy intellectual discipline, is a heterogeneous collection of problems that concern the arts primarily but also relate to nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = George | last = T. Dickie | title = aesthetics | work = Encyclopedia Americana | volume = 1 | editor1-first = Barbara | editor1-last = Letta Cole | editor2 = et. al. | place = Danbury | publisher = Grolier | year = 1993 | page = 234}}.&lt;/ref&gt; even though his later definition in the fragment ''Aesthetica'' (1750) is more often referred to as the first definition of modern aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = N | last = Wilson | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8pXhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21 | title = Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece | page = 20 | publisher = Routledge | date = 31 Oct 2013 | ISBN = 1-136-78800-X | accessdate = 2015-05-12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics and the philosophy of art==
{{quotation|Aesthetics is for the artist as [[Ornithology]] is for the birds.|[[Barnett Newman]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnettnewman.org/chronology.php Barnett Newman Foundation, Chronology, 1952] Retrieved 30 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Abuse of Beauty: Aesthetics and the Concept of Art'', By Arthur Coleman Danto, p.1, Published by Open Court Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8126-9540-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8126-9540-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For some, aesthetics is considered a synonym for the philosophy of art since [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], while others insist that there is a significant distinction between these closely related fields. In practice, aesthetic judgement refers to the sensory contemplation or appreciation of an object (not necessarily an [[art object]]), while artistic judgement refers to the recognition, appreciation or criticism of art or an [[work of art|art work]].

Philosophical aesthetics has not only to speak about art and to produce judgments about art works, but also has to give a [[definition]] of what art is. Art is an [[autonomous]] entity for philosophy, because art deals with the [[senses]] (i. e. the etymology of aesthetics) and art is as such free of any moral or political purpose. Hence, there are two different conceptions of art in aesthetics: art as [[knowledge]] or art as action, but aesthetics is neither [[epistemology]] nor ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annemarie Gethmann-Siefert]], ''Introduction to Aesthetics'' (''Einführung in die Ästhetik''), Munich, Wilhelm Fink, 1995, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aestheticians compare historical developments with theoretical approaches to the arts of many periods. They study the varieties of art in relation to their physical, social, and culture environments. Aestheticians also use psychology to understand how people see, hear, imagine, think, learn, and act in relation to the materials and problems of art. Aesthetic psychology studies the creative process and the aesthetic experience.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Munro, "aesthetics", The World Book Encyclopedia, Vol. 1, ed. A. Richard Harmet, et. al., (Chicago: Merchandise Mart Plaza, 1986), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetic judgment, universals and ethics==

===Aesthetic judgment&lt;!--'Aesthetic judgment' redirects here--&gt;===

Aesthetics examines our [[Bloom's taxonomy#The affective domain (emotion-based)|affective domain]] response to an object or phenomenon Judgments of aesthetic value rely on our ability to discriminate at a sensory level. However, '''aesthetic judgments'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; usually go beyond sensory discrimination.

For [[David Hume]], delicacy of taste is not merely "the ability to detect all the ingredients in a composition", but also our sensitivity "to pains as well as pleasures, which escape the rest of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''Essays Moral, Political, Literary'', Indianapolis: Literary Fund, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the sensory discrimination is linked to capacity for [[pleasure]].

For [[Immanuel Kant]]  (''[[Critique of Judgment]]'', 1790), "enjoyment" is the result when pleasure arises from sensation, but [[The Critique of Judgment|judging something]] to be "beautiful" has a third requirement: sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging our capacities of reflective contemplation. Judgments of beauty are sensory, emotional and intellectual all at once. Kant (1790) observed of a man "If he says that canary wine is agreeable he is quite content if someone else corrects his terms and reminds him to say instead: It is agreeable to ''me''," because "Everyone has his own ([[sense]] of) [[taste]]". The case of "beauty" is different from mere "agreeableness" because, "If he proclaims something to be beautiful, then he requires the same liking from others; he then judges not just for himself but for everyone, and speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things." [[Roger Scruton]] has argued similarly.

Viewer interpretations of beauty may on occasion be observed to possess two concepts of value: aesthetics and taste. Aesthetics is the philosophical notion of beauty. Taste is a result of an education process and awareness of elite cultural values learned through exposure to [[mass culture]]. Bourdieu examined how the elite in society define the aesthetic values like taste and how varying levels of exposure to these values can result in variations by class, cultural background, and education.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre (1984). Distinction. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-674-21277-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kant, beauty is subjective and universal; thus certain things are beautiful to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/|title=Aesthetic Judgment|publisher=|accessdate=|last = Zangwill|first = Nick|work = The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date = 26 August 2014|editor-last = Zalta|editor-first = Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], there are six conditions for the presentation of art: beauty, form, representation, reproduction of reality, artistic expression and innovation. However, one may not be able to pin down these qualities in a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Władysław|last = Tatarkiewicz|title = A History of Six Ideas: an essay in aesthetics |date = 1980|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/A_history_of_six_ideas.html?id=eD4qAQAAMAAJ|publisher=PWN/Polish Scientific Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Factors involved in aesthetic judgment====
[[File:Double-alaskan-rainbow.jpg|thumb|[[Rainbow]]s often have aesthetic appeal.]]

Judgments of aesthetical values seem often to involve many other kinds of issues as well. Responses such as disgust show that sensory detection is linked in [[instinct]]ual ways to [[facial expression]]s, and even behaviours like the [[gag reflex]]. Yet disgust can often be a learned or cultural issue too; as Darwin pointed out, seeing a stripe of soup in a man's beard is disgusting even though neither [[soup]] nor [[beard]]s are themselves disgusting. Aesthetic judgments may be linked to emotions or, like emotions, partially embodied in our physical reactions. For example, the [[awe]] inspired by a [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] landscape might physically manifest with an increased heart-rate or pupil dilation; physiological reaction may express or even cause the initial awe. As seen, emotions are conformed to 'cultural' reactions, therefore aesthetics is always characterized by 'regional responses', as Francis Grose was the first to affirm in his ‘Rules for Drawing Caricaturas: With an Essay on Comic Painting’ (1788), published in W. Hogarth, The Analysis of Beauty, Bagster, London s.d. (1791? [1753]), pp.&amp;nbsp;1–24. Grose can therefore be claimed to be the first critical 'aesthetic regionalist' in proclaiming the anti-universality of aesthetics in contrast to the perilous and always resurgent dictatorship of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Yvonne|last = Bezrucka|title = The Invention of Northern Aesthetics in 18th-Century English Literature |date = 2017|url = http://www.cambridgescholars.com/the-invention-of-northern-aesthetics-in-18th-century-english-literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, aesthetic judgments may be culturally conditioned to some extent. [[Victorian Era|Victorians]] in Britain often saw [[African sculpture]] as ugly, but just a few decades later, [[Edwardian Era|Edwardian]] audiences saw the same sculptures as being beautiful. Evaluations of beauty may well be linked to desirability, perhaps even to [[Human sexuality|sexual]] desirability. Thus, judgments of [[Architectural design values|aesthetic value]] can become linked to judgments of economic, political, or [[morality|moral]] value.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and [[Industrial design]]: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a current context, one might judge a [[Lamborghini]] to be beautiful partly because it is desirable as a status symbol, or we might judge it to be repulsive partly because it signifies for us over-consumption and offends our political or moral values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last = Korsmeyer |editor-first = Carolyn |title =Aesthetics: The Big Questions|date = 1998|publisher =Wiley-Blackwell |isbn = 978-0631205944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic judgments can often be very fine-grained and internally contradictory. Likewise aesthetic judgments seem often to be at least partly intellectual and interpretative. It is what a thing means or symbolizes for us that is often what we are judging. Modern aestheticians have asserted that [[free will|will]] and [[Desire (emotion)|desire]] were almost dormant in aesthetic experience, yet [[preference]] and [[choice]] have seemed important aesthetics to some 20th-century thinkers. The point is already made by [[David Hume|Hume]], but see Mary Mothersill, "Beauty and the Critic's Judgment", in The Blackwell Guide to Aesthetics, 2004. Thus aesthetic judgments might be seen to be based on the senses, emotions, intellectual opinions, will, desires, culture, preferences, values, subconscious behaviour, conscious decision, training, instinct, sociological institutions, or some complex combination of these, depending on exactly which theory one employs.

A third major topic in the study of aesthetic judgments is how they are unified across art forms. For instance, the source of a painting's beauty has a different character to that of beautiful music, suggesting their aesthetics differ in kind.&lt;ref&gt;Consider Clement Greenberg's arguments in "On Modernist Painting" (1961), reprinted in Aesthetics: A Reader in Philosophy of Arts.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinct inability of language to express aesthetic judgment and the role of [[Social constructionism|Social construction]] further cloud this issue.

===Aesthetic universals===
The philosopher [[Denis Dutton]] identified six universal signatures in human aesthetics:&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;[[Denis Dutton]]'s ''Aesthetic Universals'' summarized by [[Steven Pinker]] in ''[[The Blank Slate]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

# Expertise or virtuosity. Humans cultivate, recognize, and admire technical artistic skills.
# Nonutilitarian pleasure. People enjoy art for art's sake, and do not demand that it keep them warm or put food on the table.
# [[Style (visual arts)|Style]]. Artistic objects and performances satisfy rules of composition that place them in a recognizable style.
# Criticism. People make a point of judging, appreciating, and interpreting works of art.
# Imitation. With a few important exceptions like abstract painting, works of art simulate experiences of the world.
# Special focus. Art is set aside from ordinary life and made a dramatic focus of experience.

Artists such as Hirschhorn have indicated that there are too many exceptions to Dutton's categories. For example, the installations of the contemporary artist [[Thomas Hirschhorn]] deliberately eschew technical virtuosity. People can appreciate a Renaissance [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] for aesthetic reasons, but such objects often had (and sometimes still have) specific devotional functions. "Rules of composition" that might be read into [[Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' or [[John Cage]]'s ''[[4′33″]]'' do not locate the works in a recognizable style (or certainly not a style recognizable at the time of the works' realization). Moreover, some of Dutton's categories seem too broad: a physicist might entertain hypothetical worlds in his/her imagination in the course of formulating a theory. Another problem is that Dutton's categories seek to universalize traditional European notions of aesthetics and art forgetting that, as André Malraux and others have pointed out, there have been large numbers of cultures in which such ideas (including the idea "art" itself) were non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure: André Malraux's Theory of Art''. (Amsterdam: Rodopi. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic ethics===
Aesthetic ethics refers to the idea that human conduct and behaviour ought to be governed by that which is beautiful and attractive. [[John Dewey]]&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John. (1932)'Ethics', with James Tufts. In: '' The Collected Works of John Dewey, 1882–1953 '' Edited Jo-Ann Boydston: Carbonsdale: Southern Illinois University Press. p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out that the unity of aesthetics and ethics is in fact reflected in our understanding of behaviour being "fair"—the word having a double meaning of attractive and morally acceptable. More recently, [[James Page (Australian educationist)|James Page]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoagepub.com/products/content/p478d75b79b1ea.php Peace Education - Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations] infoagepub.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12263/|title=Peace Education : Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations|first=Page, James|last=S.|date=22 October 2017|website=eprints.qut.edu.au|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that aesthetic ethics might be taken to form a philosophical rationale for [[peace education]].

==New Criticism and ''The Intentional Fallacy''==
During the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the [[New Criticism]] school and debate concerning ''the intentional fallacy''. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.

In 1946, [[W. K. Wimsatt|William K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "[[Intentional Fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]], or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work.  For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.

In another essay, "[[Affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]]," which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the [[reader-response]] school of literary theory. One of the leading theorists from this school, [[Stanley Fish]], was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Vincent B., et al., eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

As summarized by Gaut and Livingston in their essay "The Creation of Art": "Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms' assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaut|first1=Berys|last2=  Livingston|first2 = Paisley|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7r27dci51FcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title =The Creation of Art| page = 3|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date =2003|isbn = 9780521812344}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors contend that: "Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"&gt;Gaut and Livingston, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from [[Formalism (art)|formalists]] stating that: "Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works." They quote [[Richard Wollheim]] as stating that, "The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"/&gt;

==Derivative forms of aesthetics==
A large number of derivative forms of aesthetics have developed as contemporary and transitory forms of inquiry associated with the field of aesthetics which include the post-modern, psychoanalytic, scientific, and mathematical among others.

===Post-modern aesthetics and psychoanalysis===
[[File:Duchamp Fountaine.jpg|thumb|left|Example of the [[Dada]] aesthetic, [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''Fountain'' 1917]]

Early-twentieth-century artists, poets and composers challenged existing notions of beauty, broadening the scope of art and aesthetics. In 1941, [[Eli Siegel]], American philosopher and poet, founded [[Aesthetic Realism]], the philosophy that reality itself is aesthetic, and that "The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green |first=Edward |title=Donald Francis Tovey, Aesthetic Realism and the Need for a Philosophic Musicology |publisher=International Revue of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music |year= 2005 |page= 227 |jstor=30032170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegel |first= Eli |title=Is Beauty the Making One of Opposites? |publisher=''Journal of Aesthetics &amp; Art Criticism |year= 1955 |jstor=425879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various attempts have been made to define [[Post-Modern]] Aesthetics. The challenge to the assumption that beauty was central to art and aesthetics, thought to be original, is actually continuous with older aesthetic theory; Aristotle was the first in the Western tradition to classify "beauty" into types as in his theory of drama, and Kant made a distinction between beauty and the sublime. What was new was a refusal to credit the higher status of certain types, where the taxonomy implied a preference for tragedy and the sublime to comedy and the [[Rococo]].

[[Benedetto Croce|Croce]] suggested that "expression" is central in the way that beauty was once thought to be central. [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] suggested that the sociological institutions of the art world were the glue binding art and sensibility into unities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Aesthetic Attitude|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aesth-at/|last = King|first = Alexandra|work = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marshall McLuhan]] suggested that art always functions as a "counter-environment" designed to make visible what is usually invisible about a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grosswiler|first1=Paul|title=Transforming McLuhan: Cultural, Critical, and Postmodern Perspectives|date=2010|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|isbn=978-1-4331-1067-2|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I19crS0qJ78C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=mcluhan+on+art+as+counter-environment#v=onepage&amp;q=mcluhan%20on%20art%20as%20counter-environment&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor Adorno]] felt that aesthetics could not proceed without confronting the role of the culture industry in the commodification of art and aesthetic experience. [[Hal Foster (art critic)|Hal Foster]] attempted to portray the reaction against beauty and Modernist art in ''The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture''. [[Arthur Danto]] has described this reaction as "kalliphobia" (after the Greek word for beauty, κάλλος ''kallos'').&lt;ref&gt;'Kalliphobia in Contemporary Art' in ''Art Journal'' v. 63 no. 2 (Summer 2004) p.&amp;nbsp;24–35&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Malraux]] explains that the notion of beauty was connected to a particular conception of art that arose with the Renaissance and was still dominant in the eighteenth century (but was supplanted later). The discipline of aesthetics, which originated in the eighteenth century, mistook this transient state of affairs for a revelation of the permanent nature of art.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure, André Malraux's Theory of Art'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Massumi]] suggests to reconsider beauty following the aesthetical thought in the philosophy of [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]].&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, Brian, (ed.), A Shock to Thought. Expression after Deleuze and Guattari. London &amp; NY: Routeledge, 2002. {{ISBN|0-415-23804-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Walter Benjamin echoed Malraux in believing aesthetics was a comparatively recent invention, a view proven wrong in the late 1970s, when Abraham Moles and Frieder Nake analyzed links between beauty, information processing, and information theory. [[Denis Dutton]] in "The Art Instinct" also proposed that an aesthetic sense was a vital evolutionary factor.

[[Jean-François Lyotard]] re-invokes the Kantian distinction between [[taste (sociology)|taste]] and the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. Sublime painting, unlike [[kitsch]] [[realism (visual arts)|realism]], "...&amp;nbsp;will enable us to see only by making it impossible to see; it will please only by causing pain."&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-Françoise, ''What is Postmodernism?'', in ''The Postmodern Condition'', Minnesota and Manchester, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-Françoise, ''Scriptures: Diffracted Traces'', in Theory, Culture and Society, Volume 21, Number 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] inaugurated aesthetical thinking in [[Psychoanalysis]] mainly via the "Uncanny" as aesthetical affect.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, "The Uncanny" (1919). Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Work of Sigmund Freud, 17:234-36. London: The Hogarth Press&lt;/ref&gt; Following Freud and [[Merleau-Ponty]],&lt;ref&gt;Merleau-Ponty, Maurice (1964), "The Visible and the Invisible". Northwestern University Press. {{ISBN|0-8101-0457-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Lacan]] theorized aesthetics in terms of sublimation and the Thing.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, Jacques, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis (The Seminar of Jacques Lacan Book VII), NY: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation of [[Marxist aesthetics]] to post-modern aesthetics is still a contentious area of debate.

===Recent aesthetics===
[[Guy Sircello]] has pioneered efforts in analytic philosophy to develop a rigorous theory of aesthetics, focusing on the concepts of beauty,&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], ''A New Theory of Beauty''. Princeton Essays on the Arts, 1. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; love&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], ''Love and Beauty''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and sublimity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], "How Is a Theory of the Sublime Possible?" ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism''
Vol. 51, No. 4 (Autumn, 1993), pp. 541–550&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to romantic theorists Sircello argued for the objectivity of beauty and formulated a theory of love on that basis.

British philosopher and theorist of [[conceptual art]] aesthetics, [[Peter Osborne (writer and academic)|Peter Osborne]], makes the point that "'[[post-conceptual art]]' aesthetic does not concern a particular type of [[contemporary art]] so much as the historical-[[ontological]] condition for the production of contemporary art in general&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All: Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. pp. 3 &amp; 51&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne noted that [http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf contemporary art is 'post-conceptual] in a public lecture delivered in 2010.

Gary Tedman has put forward a theory of a subjectless aesthetics derived from [[Karl Marx]]'s concept of alienation, and [[Louis Althusser]]'s antihumanism, using elements of Freud's group psychology, defining a concept of the 'aesthetic level of practice'.&lt;ref&gt;Tedman, G. (2012) ''Aesthetics &amp; Alienation'', Zero Books&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gregory Loewen]] has suggested that the subject is key in the interaction with the aesthetic object. The work of art serves as a vehicle for the projection of the individual's identity into the world of objects, as well as being the irruptive source of much of what is uncanny in modern life. As well, art is used to memorialize individuated biographies in a manner that allows persons to imagine that they are part of something greater than themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Loewen]], Aesthetic Subjectivity, 2011 pages&amp;nbsp;36–7, 157, 238)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics and science===
[[File:Mandel zoom 00 mandelbrot set.jpg|thumb|The [[Mandelbrot set]] with continuously coloured environment]]

The field of [[experimental aesthetics]] was founded by [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] in the 19th century. Experimental aesthetics in these times had been characterized by a [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]-based, [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] approach. The analysis of individual experience and behaviour based on [[experiment|experimental methods]] is a central part of experimental aesthetics. In particular, the perception of works of art,&lt;ref&gt;Kobbert, M. (1986), ''Kunstpsychologie'' ("Psychology of art"), Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt&lt;/ref&gt; music, or modern items such as websites&lt;ref&gt;Thielsch, M. T. (2008), ''Ästhetik von Websites. Wahrnehmung von Ästhetik und deren Beziehung zu Inhalt, Usability und Persönlichkeitsmerkmalen.'' ("The aesthetics of websites. Perception of aesthetics and its relation to content, usability, and personality traits."), MV Wissenschaft, Münster&lt;/ref&gt; or other IT products&lt;ref&gt;Hassenzahl, M. (2008), ''Aesthetics in interactive products: Correlates and consequences of beauty''. In H. N. J. Schifferstein &amp; P. Hekkert (Eds.): ''Product Experience.'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;287–302). Elsevier, Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt; is studied. Experimental aesthetics is strongly oriented towards the [[natural science]]s. Modern approaches mostly come from the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] or [[neuroscience]] ([[neuroaesthetics]]&lt;ref&gt;Martindale, C. (2007), ''Recent trends in the psychological study of aesthetics, creativity, and the arts''. In ''Empirical Studies of the Arts'', 25(2), p.&amp;nbsp;121–141.&lt;/ref&gt;).

In the 1970s, [[Abraham Moles]] and [[Frieder Nake]] were among the first to analyze links between aesthetics, [[information processing]], and [[information theory]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Moles: ''Théorie de l'information et perception esthétique'', Paris, Denoël, 1973 ([[Information Theory]] and aesthetical perception)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F Nake (1974). Ästhetik als Informationsverarbeitung. (Aesthetics as [[information processing]]). Grundlagen und Anwendungen der Informatik im Bereich ästhetischer Produktion und Kritik. Springer, 1974, {{ISBN|3-211-81216-4}}, {{ISBN|978-3-211-81216-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] described an [[algorithm]]ic theory of beauty which takes the [[subjectivity]] of the observer into account and postulates: among several observations classified as comparable by a given subjective observer, the aesthetically most pleasing one is the one with the shortest description, given the observer's previous knowledge and his particular method for encoding the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1576418|title=Low-Complexity Art|first=Jürgen|last=Schmidhuber|date=22 October 1997|publisher=|journal=Leonardo|volume=30|issue=2|pages=97–103|accessdate=|doi=10.2307/1576418}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/beauty.html|title=THEORY OF BEAUTY - FACIAL ATTRACTIVENESS - LOW-COMPLEXITY ART|website=www.idsia.ch|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is closely related to the principles of [[algorithmic information theory]] and [[minimum description length]]. One of his examples: [[mathematician]]s enjoy simple proofs with a short description in their [[formal language]]. Another very concrete example describes an aesthetically pleasing human face whose proportions can be described by very few [[bit]]s of information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Jürgen Schmidhuber|first =Jürgen |last= Schmidhuber |title = Facial beauty and fractal geometry|website = Cogprint Archive|url =http://cogprints.org/690/1/newlocoface.html |deadurl = no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130215106/http://cogprints.org/690/1/newlocoface.html |archivedate=30 November 2012 |date = 7 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J. Schmidhuber]]. Simple Algorithmic Principles of Discovery, Subjective Beauty, Selective Attention, Curiosity &amp; Creativity. Proc. 10th Intl. Conf. on Discovery Science (DS 2007) p.&amp;nbsp;26–38, LNAI 4755, Springer, 2007. Also in Proc. 18th Intl. Conf. on Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT 2007) p. 32, LNAI 4754, Springer, 2007. Joint invited lecture for DS 2007 and ALT 2007, Sendai, Japan, 2007. {{arxiv|0709.0674}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing inspiration from less detailed 15th century proportion studies by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]]. Schmidhuber's theory explicitly distinguishes between what's [[Beauty|beautiful]] and what's [[interesting]], stating that interestingness corresponds to the [[first derivative]] of subjectively perceived beauty. Here the premise is that any observer continually tries to improve the [[predictability]] and [[compressibility]] of the observations by discovering regularities such as repetitions and [[symmetries]] and [[fractal]] [[self-similarity]]. Whenever the observer's learning process (which may be a predictive [[artificial neural network]]; see also [[Neuroesthetics]]) leads to improved data compression such that the observation sequence can be described by fewer [[bit]]s than before, the temporary [[interest (emotion)|interest]]ingness of the data corresponds to the number of saved bits. This compression progress is proportional to the observer's internal reward, also called curiosity reward. A [[reinforcement learning]] algorithm is used to maximize future expected reward by learning to execute action sequences that cause additional [[interesting]] input data with yet unknown but learnable predictability or regularity. The principles can be implemented on artificial agents which then exhibit a form of [[Artificial intelligence|artificial]] [[curiosity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J. Schmidhuber]].

===Truth in beauty and mathematics===
Mathematical considerations, such as [[symmetry]] and [[complexity]], are used for analysis in theoretical aesthetics. This is different from the aesthetic considerations of [[applied aesthetics]] used in the study of [[mathematical beauty]]. Aesthetic considerations such as [[symmetry]] and [[Occam's razor|simplicity]] are used in areas of philosophy, such as [[Categorical imperative|ethics]] and [[theoretical physics]] and [[cosmology]] to [[define]] [[truth]], outside of [[empirical]] considerations. Beauty and [[Truth]] have been argued to be nearly synonymous,&lt;ref&gt;Why Beauty Is Truth: The History of Symmetry, [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]], 2008&lt;/ref&gt; as reflected in the statement "Beauty is truth, truth beauty" in the poem [[Ode on a Grecian Urn]] by [[John Keats]], or by the Hindu motto "Satyam Shivam Sundaram" (Satya (Truth) is Shiva (God), and Shiva is Sundaram (Beautiful)). The fact that judgments of beauty and judgments of truth both are influenced by [[processing fluency]], which is the ease with which information can be processed, has been presented as an explanation for why beauty is sometimes equated with truth.&lt;ref&gt;Reber, R, [[Norbert Schwarz|Schwarz, N]], Winkielman, P: "Processing fluency and aesthetic pleasure: Is beauty in the perceiver's processing experience?", ''Personality and Social Psychology Review'', 8(4):364-382&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, recent research found that people use beauty as an indication for truth in mathematical pattern tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Reber, R, Brun, M, Mitterndorfer, K: "The use of heuristics in intuitive mathematical judgment", ''Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review'', 15(6):1174–1178&lt;/ref&gt; However, scientists including the mathematician [[David Orrell]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Orrell |first=David |title=Truth or Beauty: Science and the Quest for Order  |location=New Haven|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-300-18661-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and physicist [[Marcelo Gleiser]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gleiser|first=Marcelo |title=A Tear at the Edge of Creation: A Radical New Vision for Life in an Imperfect Universe |publisher=Free Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4391-0832-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that the emphasis on aesthetic criteria such as symmetry is equally capable of leading scientists astray.

===Computational approaches===
In 1928, the mathematician [[George David Birkhoff]] created an aesthetic measure ''M = O/C'' as the ratio of order to complexity.&lt;ref name="Akiba2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Akiba|first1=Fuminori|title=Preface: Natural Computing and Computational Aesthetics|journal=Natural Computing and Beyond|volume=6|date=2013|pages=117–118|doi=10.1007/978-4-431-54394-7_10|series=Proceedings in Information and Communications Technology|isbn=978-4-431-54393-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since about 2005, computer scientists have attempted to develop automated methods to infer aesthetic quality of images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=R. |last1=Datta |first2=D. |last2=Joshi |first3=J. |last3=Li |first4=J. |last4=Wang |title=Studying aesthetics in photographic images using a computational approach |booktitle=Europ.

The Acquine engine, developed at [[Penn State University]], rates natural photographs uploaded by users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acquine.alipr.com |title=Aesthetic Quality Inference Engine - Instant Impersonal Assessment of Photos |publisher=Penn State University |accessdate=21 June 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090509101935/http://acquine.alipr.com/| archivedate= 9 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been relatively successful attempts with regard to chess{{explain|date=October 2018}} and music.&lt;ref&gt;Manaris, B., Roos, P., Penousal, M., Krehbiel, D., Pellicoro, L. and Romero, J.; A Corpus-Based Hybrid Approach to Music Analysis and Composition; Proceedings of 22nd Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-07); Vancouver, BC; 839-845 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A relation between [[Max Bense]]'s mathematical formulation of aesthetics in terms of "redundancy" and "complexity" and theories of musical anticipation was offered using the notion of Information Rate.&lt;ref&gt;Dubnov, S.; Musical Information Dynamics as Models of Auditory Anticipation; in Machine Audition: Principles, Algorithms and Systems, Ed. W. Weng, IGI Global publication, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary aesthetics===
{{main|Evolutionary aesthetics}}
Evolutionary aesthetics refers to [[evolutionary psychology]] theories in which the basic aesthetic preferences of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' are argued to have [[evolution|evolved]] in order to enhance survival and reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shimura|first1=Arthur P.|last2=Palmer|first2=Stephen E.|title=Aesthetic Science: Connecting Minds, Brains, and Experience|date=January 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example being that humans are argued to find beautiful and prefer [[landscape]]s which were good [[habitat]]s in the ancestral environment. Another example is that body symmetry and proportion are important aspects of [[physical attractiveness]] which may be due to this indicating good health during body growth. Evolutionary explanations for aesthetical preferences are important parts of [[evolutionary musicology]], [[Darwinian literary studies]], and the study of the [[evolution of emotion]].

===Applied aesthetics===
{{Main|Applied aesthetics}}

As well as being applied to art, aesthetics can also be applied to cultural objects, such as crosses or tools. For example, aesthetic coupling between art-objects and medical topics was made by speakers working for the US Information Agency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Giannini AJ |title=Tangential symbols: using visual symbolization to teach pharmacological principles of drug addiction to international audiences |journal=Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=33 |issue=12 |pages=1139–46 |date=December 1993 |pmid=7510314 |doi=10.1002/j.1552-4604.1993.tb03913.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Art slides were linked to slides of pharmacological data, which improved attention and retention by simultaneous activation of intuitive right brain with rational left. It can also be used in topics as diverse as [[Mathematical beauty|mathematics]], [[gastronomy]], fashion and website design.&lt;ref&gt;Moshagen, M. &amp; Thielsch, M. T. (2010). Facets of visual aesthetics. In: ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'', 68 (10), 689-709.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/visual_aesthetics.html |title=Visual Aesthetics |publisher=Interaction-design.org |date= |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lavie, T. &amp; Tractinsky, N. (2004). Assessing dimensions of perceived visual aesthetics of web sites. International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 60, 269–298.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The philosophy of aesthetics as a practice has been criticized by some sociologists and writers of art and society. [[Raymond Williams]] argues that there is no unique and or individual aesthetic object which can be extrapolated from the art world, but that there is a continuum of cultural forms and experience of which ordinary speech and experiences may signal as art. By "art" we may frame several artistic "works" or "creations" as so though this reference remains within the institution or special event which creates it and this leaves some works or other possible "art" outside of the frame work, or other interpretations such as other phenomenon which may not be considered as "art".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Pierre Bourdieu]] disagrees with Kant's idea of the "aesthetic". He argues that Kant's "aesthetic" merely represents an experience that is the product of an elevated class habitus and scholarly leisure as opposed to other possible and equally valid "aesthetic" experiences which lay outside Kant's narrow definition.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Timothy Laurie argues that theories of musical aesthetics "framed entirely in terms of appreciation, contemplation or reflection risk idealizing an implausibly unmotivated listener defined solely through musical objects, rather than seeing them as a person for whom complex intentions and motivations produce variable attractions to cultural objects and practices".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title= Music Genre As Method | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | newspaper= Cultural Studies Review | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/9087511}} 20 (2), pp.&amp;nbsp;283–292.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andeel''' is an [[Egypt]]ian cartoonist. His work has come into the forefront since the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]].

==Biography==
Andeel was born in [[Kafr al-Sheikh]] in 1986. Andeel would often visit [[Cairo]] with his parents despite not living there. He says he loved Cairo from a young age and decided to move there when he was seventeen years old after he finished high school. His first job was with ''[[Al Gael]]'' newspaper. A year later, he moved to ''Al Dostour'' newspaper where he worked under veteran cartoonist Amr Selim. From there, Andeel moved to another privately owned paper, ''Al Masry Al Youm'', and cofounded its quarterly comics magazine, ''Tok-Tok''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile of Andeel: Cartoonist, autodidact, funny man|date=24 March 2014|first=Jahd|last=Khalil|website=Mada Masr|url=http://madamasr.com/content/profile-andeel-cartoonist-autodidact-funny-man}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andeel liked cartoons as a kid. His father showed him the work of Egyptian cartoonist Salah Jaheen, which he says has had a huge impact on his work. Many of the work Andeel was exposed to prior to Jaheen was foreign, so seeing Jaheen’s work about Egypt was a motivating factor to his getting involved in cartooning. Before becoming a prominent cartoonist, however, Andeel tried his luck at script writing and standup comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andeel - أنديل|author=Medrar.TV|date=24 March 2014|website=[[YouTube]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM8rsuGjOYw#t=678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Andeel's work is based on political satire.
His uncle told him that his paternal grandfather was a filmmaker who made a feature film called “Horses,” which he took to the Berlin Film Festival. Due to racism it was overlooked for the big prize though it clearly deserved it, and on the boat back to Egypt he threw the only copy of the film overboard and retired from cinema. Knowledge of this outrage compelled Andeel to move to Cairo and become a professional cartoonist at a very early age, as well as making short films (such as “Who Knows?”, a psychedelic film noir set in the wild west), writing TV scripts, designing newspapers, co-founding “Tok Tok” comics magazine, launching “Radhio Kafril Sheikh el Habeeba,” and using Facebook a lot. He is studying for a certificate in social work. In 2012 he got married to a really great woman.

The '''Arts District''' is a neighborhood on the eastern edge of [[Downtown Los Angeles]], California, United States. The gritty area has given new life to old industrial buildings whose history often dates to the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="LAT 3-7/2015"/&gt; While much of the early creative art was done behind closed doors, the street scene has slowly been activated in the early years of the 21st century as more and more factories are creatively reused with some new construction interspersed.&lt;ref name="LAT 20130120"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/20/business/la-fi-commre-arts-district-20130120|title=Gaining Traction: Trendy shops, eateries and offices transform downtown L.A.'s arts district|date= January 20, 2013|first=Roger |last=Vincent|access-date=29 July 2017|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art galleries]] have opened and given recognition to the area amidst the entire downtown where [[Art museums]] and additional galleries can be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ladowntownnews.com/news/the-downtowners-of-distinction/article_1b311095-358e-5d39-ab5b-351f6dcb9c1a.html|title=The Downtowners of Distinction|first=Jon |last=Regardie|date= February 18, 2011|work=[[Los Angeles Downtown News]]|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city community planning boundaries are [[Alameda Street]] on the west which blends into [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles|Little Tokyo]], [[First Street (Los Angeles)|First Street]] on the north, the [[Los Angeles River]] to the east, and Violet Street on the south.

==Early history==
Spanish Father Juan Crespi founded what is now known as the Arts District in 1796 during an expedition going to Alta California. During his journey he discovered a body of water that was surrounded by rich soil, this then inspired a passage into his observation journal that states: "Should a town be needed in this location, this site shall be called Our Lady Queen of the Angels." The small pueblo was declared a new territory for the Spanish and was officially founded on September 4, 1781.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsdistrictla.org/arts-district-history/|title=Founding a city|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vignes Street winds through the northeastern edge of the Arts District, parallel to and a couple of blocks west of the broad cement trench that memorializes the L.A. River. It is named for [[Jean-Louis Vignes]], an aging adventurer and vintner who arrived in Los Angeles in 1831 by way of the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) and Bordeaux. He planted grapes on 104 acres where Cabernet and Sauvignon Blanc vines imported from the south of France thrived, and by 1849 El Aliso - what the Vignes vineyard was entitled, called so after the sacred local sycamore tree of the same name&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lapl.org/collections-resources/blogs/lapl/forgotten-los-angeles-history-el-aliso-big-tree-los-angeles |title=Forgotten Los Angeles History: El Aliso, the Big Tree of Los Angeles &amp;#124; Los Angeles Public Library |publisher=Lapl.org |date=2018-04-27 |access-date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; - was the largest producer of wine in California. The grapes are gone, but the San Antonio Winery just north of the community is a reminder of the area’s past.

By the late 19th century, oranges and grapefruit had replaced grapes as the principal agricultural products of the area and the property west of the riverbank was thick with citrus groves. The groves provided a location for filmmaker DW Griffith who filmed parts of Hollywood’s first feature film (''In Old California'') there in 1909. A single grapefruit tree remains, towering over the Japanese American Plaza off San Pedro Street and Azusa. Somewhere near Third Street and Alameda, a print shop became the area’s first commercial arts enterprise, employing artists from around the region designing labels for the boxes of citrus fruit shipped across the country.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The growing [[Santa Fe Freight Depot]] and warehouses created to serve the citrus industry’s shipping needs determined the area’s economic character for most of the next century and were responsible for the architectural flavor of the Arts District structures that have survived earthquakes, flood and fire. The single room hotels for rail workers to the northwest and the growth of Little Tokyo to the west and [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]] to the north created a mix that was working class and cosmopolitan.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

By World War II, the citrus groves had been replaced by factories and the rail freight business was giving way to the trucking industry. The area had taken on an industrial character that was growing seedy around the edges.&lt;ref name="LAT 20130120"/&gt; Over the next twenty years, many of the independent small manufacturers had either been absorbed by larger competitors, grown too big for their quarters – or simply failed—and an increasing number of vacant warehouse and former factory spaces contributed to a dingy, decaying urban environment typical of many aging big American cities of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/17/local/la-me-ln-downtown-security-pullout-20130517|title=Private security patrols pull out of downtown Arts District|date= May 17, 2013|access-date=28 July 2017|first=Gale |last=Holland|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950's many manufacturing companies fled oversees or were overtaken by larger manufacturing companies, resulting in vacant buildings and bringing property values down. Artists who were struggling to pay rent in the city started moving to the Arts District in the late 1960's and early 1970's. Before 1979 the Arts District buildings had been zoned for industrial use only. It wasn't until 1979 that the State of California passed a live/work legislation {{citation needed|date=November 2018}} and in 1981 Los Angeles passed the bill Artist-In-Residence (AIR) . This new bill AIR would allow artists to live legally in the areas that could no longer be used for industrial use as long as they attained a business license. To make the living standards more comfortable the building code was lifted.New regulations had been created and the AIR legislation required the lofts to have a room to sleep, fire alarm, and other requirements for them to live legally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Lindsey|date=2014|title="Isolation and authenticity in Los Angeles' arts district neighborhood"|url=|journal=Dissertations &amp; Theses Global: The Humanities and Social Sciences Collection|volume=|page=157|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art scene==
In 1969, [[Allen Ruppersberg]] presented ''Al's Cafe'' at 1913 West Sixth Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.christinewongyap.com/tag/als-cafe/|title=Al’s Cafe - R+D|website=blog.christinewongyap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In the mid-'70s, a handful of artists, including Joel Bass, Dan Citron, Woods Davy, Marc Kreisel, [[Jon Peterson (artist)|Jon Peterson]], Stephen Seemayer, Maura Sheehan, [[Coleen Sterritt]], Sydney Littenberg, Peter Zecher, and others saw opportunity in the empty buildings and began colonizing the area, converting former industrial and commercial spaces into working studios, sometimes renting space for as little as a three cents a square foot and carving out living quarters. This resulted in a surge of artistic activity, culminating in the highly controversial "Downtown L.A. in Santa Barbara" exhibition, organized by Betty Klausner for the Santa Barbara Contemporary Arts Forum, which is now known as the Museum of Contemporary Art Santa Barbara. By the mid 1980s, the following artists were also living downtown: Linda Frye Burman, James Croak, [[Merion Estes]], Joe Fay, [[George Herms]], Mary Jones, Constance Mallinson, [[Paul McCarthy]], Margaret Nielson, Richard Newton, Margit Omar, [[Lari Pittman]], John Schroeder, Judy Simonian, [[Andy Wilf]], and Takako Yamaguchi.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Stephen Seemayer's film ''The Young Turks''(2012) documents the 1979–1981 years.

In 1979, Marc Kreisel opened [[Al's Bar (American Hotel)|Al's Bar]] opened in the American Hotel on Hewitt just off Traction. This legendary punk rock venue was the training ground for [[Sonic Youth]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Beck]], [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]], [[the Residents]], introducing generations of Angelenos to dozens of emerging groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/16/news/cl-34651 |title=Raise a Glass for Al's Bar--It's Last Call |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Laurie |last=Pike |date=August 16, 2001 |access-date=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular sound band "Party Boys" played the bars and art events.Also known as the downtown artists' central meeting place, Al's Bar occasionally hosted art exhibitions. Al's Bar, the west coast's oldest punk club,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} finally closed in 2001, and the American Hotel received a facelift in 2012 and was renamed the American Apartments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladowntownnews.com/news/upgrades-for-arts-district-projects/article_6d01e57a-6fb6-11e1-888b-001871e3ce6c.html|title=Upgrades for Arts District Projects|first=Richard|last=Guzmán|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LA Artcore, founded in 1976 by Lydia Takeshita with the purpose of exhibiting local artists, exists today in locations at [[the Brewery Art Colony]] and in [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles|Little Tokyo]]. The Atomic Cafe on 1st Street at Alameda was an artists and musicians haunt in the late 1970s and early 1980s. [[Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions]] (LACE) created exhibitions at its gallery space, located in the late 70s on Broadway St before moving to Industrial Street in the 1980s. Several commercial art galleries, including Oranges and Sardines, Kirk DeGoyer Gallery, the Downtown Gallery, Vanguard Gallery, Exile, and Galleria by the Water opened in the late seventies, only to close in the early eighties. Cirrus Editions, the first gallery to open downtown, remains open.

Around 1980, [[Jon Peterson (artist)|Jon Peterson]] and Stephen Seemayer opened “DTLA," a club that had exactly one show before it closed, adjacent the Atomic Cafe. [[High Performance Magazine]] used DTLA as its performance space until its one-year lease was up. During that year, [[Paul McCarthy]] performed ''Monkey Man'' during the Public Spirit Performance Festival, Part 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://charlesrivacollection.com/images/artistsProfile/resume/PaulMcCarthy-2.pdf ]{{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name DTLA was later adopted by the neighboring coffee house where [[Beck]] got his start.

In 1981, the City of Los Angeles passed its "Artist in Residence" or "AIR" ordinance, which allowed residential use of formerly industrial and commercially zoned buildings; artists had long used such spaces as living quarters illegally, and the AIR law sought to bring this practice into legality and regulation.&lt;ref name=Gerber&gt;Gerber, Marisa (July 29, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-arts-district-20140730-story.html "Arts District's changing landscape is worrisome to longtime residents"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Retrieved 15 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Art galleries, cafes and performance venues opened as the live/work population grew. 
During the '80s, Bedlam, created by artist Jim Fittipaldi,  on 6th Street (and later, briefly, in the former premises of Al’s bar) was a salon with drawing workshops, art installations, theater, live music and a speakeasy. Dangerous Curve, on a dangerous curve of 4th Place between Mateo and Molino, put on exhibitions of artists whose work was often difficult to categorize. The Spanish Kitchen, a warehouse space on Third near Traction, was home to series of happenings, events, raves, installations and blowout parties. It now houses the 3rd Steakhouse and Lounge, an eatery that hosts community events and exhibitions of works by local artists. Cocola (later known as the 410 Boyd St. Bar and Grill), the legendary artists’ bar just west of the Arts District, lives on as Escondite.

In 1985, Fritz Frauchiger curated "Off the Street," a "one-time art exhibition" sponsored by the Cultural Affairs Department in the Old City Print Shop, which featured paintings, sculptures, photographs and installations by 48 Los Angeles artists, most of whom lived downtown.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Frauchiger.

In 1994, the nonprofit group Downtown Arts Development Association (DADA) was formed as a spinoff of LARABA by several artist members of the LARABA board of directors in order to provide a platform for the burgeoning downtown art scene; DADA hosted exhibits of more than 400 downtown artists in 1994–1998. [[File:DADA 1994 Artists.jpg|thumb|DADA 1994 Artists]]After 1994, the heart of the Arts District was Bloom’s General Store, presided over by Joel Bloom, a veteran of Chicago’s Second City, who became an advocate for the community and who is remembered as The Arts District’s once and only unofficial mayor. Bloom died in 2007, but his memory is honored with a plaque from the city declaring the triangle around Third, Traction and Rose to be Joel Bloom Square.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Valerie J.

== Transportation ==
&lt;p&gt;The Arts District is strategically located near the center of Downtown LA making it easier accessible for alternate forms of transportation. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) Gold Line station is located along Alameda St. The cross section streets are along East First St. and East Temple St. The small neighborhood is also serviced by the Los Angeles Department of Transportations (LADOT) DASH bus making several stops on Hewitt St. Additionally, Metro offers a bike share program in many neighborhoods around the Arts District area. The following five stations currently available to pick up or leave a bike are listed below. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsdistrictla.org/getting-around/|title=Getting Around|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;740 E 3rd St.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;999 E 3rd St.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1245 Factory Place&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1301 Willow St.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;720 E Temple St.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;There are a total of sixteen parking lots scattered around the Arts District.

==Gentrification==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}

The real estate history of the Arts District in Los Angeles doesn't fit the usual definition of "gentrification." In the 1970s there were millions of square feet of empty commercial and industrial space in downtown LA. Around 1970, artists began to colonize these spaces illegally and use them for live in studios. In 1980, in order to legalize these ad-hoc and unsafe residences, the City of Los Angeles created the "Artist in Residence" zoning variation ordinance. The ordinance necessarily included mandated upgrades to the artists spaces, many of which had fire/safety/health issues endangering the (artist) occupants. It also enabled developers who wished to rehab or create new or old studios that were now legal. These developments, with their increased building and safety requirements, raised the retail rental rates from 10–30 cents per square foot to about 65 cents per square foot in the early to mid-1980s.

In the late 1980s and through the 1990s several (about 20) large artist loft projects were developed from empty industrial buildings, including The Brewery, 900 East 1st St, Citizens Warehouse, 2101 E. 7th St., and Long Beach Ave Lofts, with rents ranging from 65 to 75 cents/ sq ft.

After 2000, developers started converting large office buildings in the area west of the arts district under a new "Live/Work" ordinance. These apartments were marketed as lofts, although they bore little resemblance to the much larger lofts in the industrial district east of Alameda St. Rents in these live/work spaces started in the early 2000s at about $1.10 / sq ft, and over the next 15 years climbed to about $2.50/sq ft, due mainly to the high demand for the apartments and the increasing purchase price for the undeveloped buildings.

The rapid "loft" development west of Alameda, in which hundreds of thousands of sq ft of heretofore unused commercial space has been converted to live/work apartments, has led to a renaissance in downtown Los Angeles, an area long considered uninhabitable by middle class Angelenos. The increased popularity for downtown residences has continued to put upward pressure on loft rent in the Arts District, pushing rents in some of the older, more authentic artists loft buildings upwards towards $1.50- $2.00/ sq ft., pushing many longtime artist/tenants out of their lofts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Carolina A. |last=Miranda |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-last-stand-artists-arts-district-20171027-htmlstory.html |title=Rent hikes and evictions — is it the last stand for artists in the Arts District? |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]  |date=October 27, 2017 |access-date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The district continues to be a popular location for filming due to the historic vibe. In 2016, the head of the neighborhood’s business improvement district commented that “There’s not one day where there’s not shooting.” The popular TV sitcom [[New Girl]] takes place largely in their apartment loft located in the Arts District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The New Girl Apartment Building|url=http://www.iamnotastalker.com/2012/04/17/the-new-girl-apartment-building/|work=iamnotastalker.com|access-date=January 31, 2017|date=April 17, 2012 | author= Lindsay }}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming has become complicated due to the development of the retail sector, coffee shops, and residents who will be disturbed by filming at night. Also many formerly empty lots and desolate streets are now under development where crews used the space to park trucks and trailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-vintage-hollywood-20161219-story.html |title='La La Land' looks beautiful, but gentrification makes it harder for old Hollywood to play itself |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=David |last=Ng |date= December 25, 2016 |access-date=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 developer Suncal will proposed a 2 billion 1.95 million sq. ft mixed use project which includes two 58 story buildings designed by Hezorg and de Meuron.

New developments have displaced artists since they can no longer afford the price hike in the Arts District. In 2016 the median price for property was $714,500. It's a huge increase from 2013 when open lofts were priced at 370 per sq ft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/|title=Los Angeles’ Arts District lures developers - but loses artists|last=Brass|first=Kevin|date=2017|website=FT.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 11, 2017 the district received a 15 million award from the Active Transportation Program which will enhance the Arts District with new bike lanes, enhancement of sidewalks,and street lighting. The program will bring two signalized intersections, pedestrian lighting, four pedestrian crosswalks, and one mile of bike lanes. Little Tokyo and Arts District Regional Connector Station will have pedestrian and bicycle access with the new Sixth Street Bridge.

Some of the changes that will occur through the program are:

· Pedestrian Plaza at Merrick St. and 4th St.

· Controlled pedestrian crossing at 4th St./4th Place split.

· Bike lanes on Santa Fe Ave. and Mateo St. down to 7th St.

· Bike lanes on Traction Ave.

· Pedestrian walkway and plaza space on 6th St Bridge frontage road &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsdistrictla.org|title=Arts District Awarded $15 Million in Multi-modal Transpo Funding|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''''aula regia''''' ([[Latin|lat.]] for "royal hall"), also referred to as a ''[[palas]] hall'', is a name given to the great hall in an imperial or royal palace (German ''[[Königspfalz|Pfalz]]''). In the [[Middle Ages]] the term was also used as a synonym for the ''Pfalz'' itself.

An example of a surviving, former [[Visigothic]] ''aula regia'' is the church of [[Santa María del Naranco]] near [[Oviedo]], built around 850 as an ''aula regia'' for [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiros I]].&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner/Fleming/Honour, ''Lexikon der Weltarchitektur'', Reinbek 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an ''aula regia'' in the [[Palace of Aachen]]ː it later became a part of the medieval [[Aachen Rathaus|Town Hall of Aachen]]. The royal hall of the ''[[Kaiserpfalz]]'' at Ingelheim has been digitally reconstructed. The architectural prototype for all of them was the [[Aula Palatina|Basilica of Constantine]] in [[Trier]].

The reception room in the [[Domus Flavia]], the palace of [[Domitian]] on the [[Palatine Hill]] in [[Rome]], is also called the ''Aula Regia''.

'''Aëdon''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀηδών}}) was in [[Greek mythology]], the daughter of [[Pandareus]] of [[Ephesus]]. According to Homer she was the wife of [[Amphion and Zethus|Zethus]], and the mother of [[Itylus]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' xix. 517, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
Envious of [[Niobe]], the wife of her husband's brother [[Amphion]], who had six sons and six daughters, she formed the plan of killing the eldest of Niobe's sons, but by mistake slew her own son Itylus. Zeus relieved her grief by changing her into a [[nightingale]], whose melancholy tunes are represented by the poet as Aëdon's lamentations about her child.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to a later tradition preserved in [[Antoninus Liberalis]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], c. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Aëdon is instead the wife of Polytechnos, an artist of [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]].  The couple boasted that they loved each other more than [[Hera]] and [[Zeus]].  Hera sent [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]] to cause trouble between the two of them.  Polytechnus was then making a chair, and Aëdon a piece of [[embroidery]], and they agreed that whoever should finish the work first should receive from the other a female slave as the prize.  Polytechnos was furious when Aëdon (with Hera's help) won.  He went to Aëdon's father, and pretending that his wife wished to see her sister Chelidonis, he took her with him.  On his way home he [[rape]]d her, dressed her in slave's attire, commanded her to silence, and gave her to his wife as the promised prize.  After some time Chelidonis, believing herself unobserved, lamented her own fate, but she was overheard by Aëdon, and the two sisters conspired against Polytechnus for revenge.  They murdered Polytechnos' son [[Itys]] and served him up as a meal to his father.

Aëdon then fled with Chelidonis to her father, who, when Polytechnos came in pursuit of his wife, had him bound, smeared with honey, and exposed to the insects.  Aëdon now took pity upon the sufferings of her husband, and when her relations were on the point of killing her for this weakness, Zeus changed Polytechnos into a [[pelican]], the brother of Aëdon into a whoop, her father into a sea-eagle, Chelidonis into a [[swallow]], and Aëdon herself into a [[nightingale]].  This myth seems to have originated in mere [[etymology|etymologies]], and is of the same class as that about [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Philomela]] and [[Procne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Schmitz  | first = Leonhard  | contribution = Aedon  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 23–24  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0032.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''book sprint''' is a method of creating a book [[collaborative writing|collaboratively]] in a short period of time, usually three to five days.&lt;ref name="What is a Book Sprint?"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Book Sprint?|url=http://www.booksprints.net/about/|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lwn"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/528730/|title=Google DocCamp 2012: Book sprints|author=Nathan Willis|date=2012-12-12|publisher=LWN.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Book sprints make use of [[Unconferences|unconference]] techniques&lt;ref name=Anatomy&gt;{{cite web|title=Anatomy of the First Book Sprint|url=http://en.flossmanuals.net/collaborative-futures/ch044_anatomy-of-the-first-book-sprint/|work=Collaborative Futures|accessdate=9 March 2014|author=Mushon Zer-Aviv |author2=Michael Mandiberg |author3=Mike Linksvayer |author4=Marta Peirano |author5=Alan Toner |author6=Aleksandar Erkalovic |author7=Adam Hyde|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Altena&gt;{{cite web|last=Altena|first=Arie|title=Book Sprinting with Adam Hyde|url=http://v2.nl/archive/articles/interview-with-adam-hyde|work=V2_ Institute for the Unstable Media|accessdate=9 March 2014|date=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure that a group of content experts under the guidance of one or more facilitators can not only write but publish a book at the end of the sprint period.

Books are made available immediately at the end of the sprint as [[e-books]] and/or with [[print-on-demand]] services.&lt;ref name="What is a book sprint?"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a book sprint?|url=http://www.booksprints.net/about/|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Book sprints have been compared to the programming sprints common in [[agile software development]] or [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]].&lt;ref name="Zennaro et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zennaro|first=Marco|author2=Canessa E |author3=Fonda C |author4=Belcher M |author5=Flickenger R |title=Book Sprint: A New Model for Rapid Book Authoring and Content Development|journal=International Journal of the Book|date=2007|volume=4|issue=1|pages=105–109|url=http://ijb.cgpublisher.com/product/pub.27/prod.120|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The seed of the book sprint was sown in London in 2005.&lt;ref name=Lovink&gt;{{cite web|last=Lovink|first=Geert|title=Thomas Krag on Booksprint and Collaborative Authoring|url=http://networkcultures.org/wpmu/outofink/2011/05/23/thomas-krag-on-booksprint-and-collaborative-authoring/|work=Boek uit de Band|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wireless network expert Tomas Krag recognized the need for a single, authoritative, online, freely licensed book on the topic of developing wireless internet infrastructure in Africa and other developing countries that could be translated into multiple languages, but he was unwilling to write the book himself using traditional methods.&lt;ref name=Lovink /&gt; This "book sprint" took several months, however, both in preparation and in post-sprint editing.&lt;ref name=Lovink /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kean&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kean|first=Martin|title=Open source publishing,‘book sprints’ and possible futures|journal=Junctures: The Journal for Thematic Dialogue|date=2012|volume=15|url=http://junctures.org/index.php/junctures/article/view/219|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Web artist and [[FLOSS Manuals]] founder Adam Hyde turned the rough idea of a book sprint into a systematic method, defining and refining the process in the course of many book sprints, and turning the book sprint into a [[Timeboxing|time-boxed]] event of at most a single week. After learning from Tomas Krag about his initial "book sprint" effort, Hyde recognized the potential of the method, especially for producing [[Free/Libre/Open Source Software]] help manuals and handbooks.&lt;ref name=Kean /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gentle&gt;{{cite book|last=Gentle|first=Anne|title=Conversation and community : the social web for documentation|date=2012|publisher=Xml Press|location=Laguna Hills, Ca.|isbn=978-1937434106|pages=54–66|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hyde facilitated a five-day book sprint in 2008 that produced a how-to book about bypassing Internet censorship as well as a prototype of a collaborative writing platform designed with the book sprint in mind.&lt;ref name="First Book Sprint"&gt;{{cite web|title=About this Manual|url=http://en.flossmanuals.net/bypassing-censorship/ch002_about-this-manual/|work=How to Bypass Internet Censorship|publisher=FLOSS Manuals|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, book sprints have been held on a wide range of topics, including [[New Art/Science Affinities|art]], education,&lt;ref name="oer13"/&gt; governance,&lt;ref name="worldbank"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbi/news/2014/01/28/world-bank-and-partners-publish-book-mining-contracts|title=World Bank and Partners Publish Book on Mining Contracts|date=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leibniz-science20.de/en/forschung/projekte/book-sprint-coscience-cebit-2014/|title=Book Sprint #CoScience @ CeBIT 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and software.&lt;ref name="lwn"/&gt;

Book sprints now generally emphasize that participants should not prepare before the sprint and should not continue work after the sprint, that one or more trained and experienced facilitators must be present who do not take part in the writing of the book, and that book sprints are an appropriate method for any topic.&lt;ref name="What is a book sprint?" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ausserhoffer&gt;{{cite web|last=Ausserhoffer|first=Julian|title=The Method of Book Sprints|url=http://ausserhofer.net/2013/02/the-method-of-book-sprints/|work=B00MBL1TZ|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hyde, book sprints are best when run by a trained facilitator and using the right kind of collaborative writing software.&lt;ref name=Altena /&gt; However, others have used variants of the process to produce books, e.g., ''Creative Sprint'', which spread work over 7 weeks, beginning and ending with face to face sprints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creative2c.info/we-proudly-present-the-booksprint/|title=We proudly present… the Booksprint!|date=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013-4 "BookSprints for ICT Research" produced a detailed study of Book Sprints, additionally producing five books at book sprints over the course of the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://booksprints-for-ict-research.eu/2014/07/25/project-results-reports-and-resources/|title=Project results, reports and resources|publisher=BookSprints for ICT Research|date=2014-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
In a book sprint, between five and fifteen experts sit together in the same space. Apart from an idea for the topic there are no requirements or contents prepared beforehand. Central to the process is the facilitator who guides the contributors through the process to develop a book in maximum five days.&lt;ref name="oer13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.cetis.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/OER13_booksprints.pdf|title=Writing in Book Sprints|author=Phil Barker|first=|author2=Lorna M.

In general, the books are distributed freely, and the main resources are not generated from sales but through sponsors or [[crowdfunding]] platforms, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hänßler|first=Boris|title=Die Neuerfindung eines alten Mediums – Das Buch als ein Ort der Begegnung|url=http://www.b-u-b.de/die-neuerfindung-eines-alten-mediums-das-buch-als-ein-ort-der-begegnung/|work=BuB – Forum Bibliothek und Information|accessdate=8 March 2014|language=German|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bronx Council on the Arts''' (established 1962), is an art based culture agency that has grown to become the official cultural agency of [[the Bronx]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/bronx-council-arts-50th-anniversary-celebrates-borough-art-jewels-article-1.975043|title=Bronx Council on the Arts celebrates 50 years|last1=Samuels|first1=Tanyanika|website=NY Daily News|language=en|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Providing a “lifeline” to more than 4,800 artists and over 250 arts and community-based organizations.

== History ==
The Bronx Council on the Arts was founded in the early 1960s when community leaders: Jerry Klot, Reverend William Kaladjian and others came together to provide summer arts &amp; culture activities in the Bronx. In 1969 the Bronx Council on the arts merged with the Bronx Committee on the Arts and worked to improve access to the arts around the Bronx by introducing various programs around the Borough including the Bronx regrets program and the opening of the [[Bronx Museum of the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bronxarts.org/history.asp|title=history - Bronx Council On The Arts|last=LLC|first=@ads-llc.com - Applied Dynamic Solutions,|website=www.bronxarts.org|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Bronx Council on the Arts continued to grow they offered their programs at various galleries and venues located throughout [[the Bronx]] but lacked a central space. That changed in 2011 when [[Chase Bank|Chase]] donated the former [[Washington Mutual]] Branch located at 2700 East Tremont Avenue to be used as their headquarters. But due to lack of funds, the group was unable to develop and utilize the space. In 2015 with support from Councilman [[James Vacca]] and [[Borough president|Borough President]] [[Ruben Diaz Jr]] and other donors, they were was able to obtain the funds needed to renovate the building and utilize it as their central office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bronxarts.org/documents/082115MoreFundingforBCA-BTR_000.pdf|title=More Funding ends BCA Headquarters Delay|last=Williams|first=Jaime|date=2015-08-25|work=Bronx Times|access-date=2017-12-02|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
The Bronx Council on the Arts runs several programs including:
* [[Bronx Recognizes Its Own Award]] (BRIO), established 1989&lt;ref name="wisnieski"&gt;Adam Wisnieski "Bronx Recognizes its Own musicians, writers and artists," ''The Riverdale Press'' June 15, 2011 http://www.riverdalepress.com/stories/Bronx-Recognizes-its-Own-musicians-writers-and-artists,48753 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929005243/http://www.riverdalepress.com/stories/Bronx-Recognizes-its-Own-musicians-writers-and-artists%2C48753 |date=2011-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newleader"&gt;Damon Beres "New leader of Bronx Council on the Arts showcases creative side of boro," Daily News July 13th 2009 http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/bronx/2009/07/12/2009-07-12_new_leader_of_bronx_arts_council_showcases_creative_side_of_boro.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bronx Writers Center - creative writing and professional development workshops. The [[Bronx Memoir Project: Vol. 1|Bronx Memoir Project]] is one of its projects.
* Longwood Art Gallery - hosted by [[Hostos Center for the Arts &amp; Culture]] in the [[Hostos Community College]] campus.
* The Bronx Cultural Trolley Arts and Culture Tour.

== Bronx Recognizes its Own (BRIO) ==
In 1989 the Bronx Council of the Arts created the [[Bronx Recognizes Its Own Award|Bronx Recognizers its Own Award]] to support Bronx based artists and performers. The number of recipients and amount each grantee received has varied over the years and recipients are expected to do community service for a local arts organization as part of the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/08/nyregion/art-painter-organizes-a-landscape-show.html|title=ART; Painter Organizes A Landscape Show|last=Raynor|first=Vivien|date=1990-04-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.riverdalepress.com/stories/Bronx-Recognizes-its-Own-musicians-writers-and-artists,48753|title=Bronx Recognizes its Own musicians, writers and artists|work=The Riverdale Press|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== APPLAUSE Awards ==
In 2011 the Bronx Council on the Arts created the APPLAUSE award to recognize artists and leaders from the Bronx. The first recipients included Eva Bornstein, executive director of Lehman Center for the Performing Arts; Madaha Kinsey-Lamb, founder and executive director of Mind-Builders Creative Arts Center; [[Holly Block]], executive director of the Bronx Museum of the Arts; Gail Nathan, executive director of the Bronx River Art Center; and Rosalba Rolón, artistic director of [[Pregones Theater]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Bronx Writers Center ==
In 1996 the Bronx Council on the Arts created the Bronx Writers Center as a means of fostering community and empowering writers. The program has grown into a yearly series of workshops located at various cultural venues across the Bronx and functions as not just a place for emerging writers to cultivate their skill but a place for writers to find creative mentors, network and work on professional development. Through collaboration with [[PEN American Center]] and the Bronx Museum of the Arts participants have the opportunity to participate in [[PEN World Voices]] literary festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bronxarts.org/bwc.asp|title=Bronx Writers Center|last=LLC|first=@ads-llc.com - Applied Dynamic Solutions,|website=www.bronxarts.org|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Burney Collection''' consists of over 1,270 17th-18th century newspapers and other news materials, gathered by [[Charles Burney (scholar)|Charles Burney]], most notable for the 18th-century London newspapers. The original collection, totalling almost 1 million pages, is held by the [[British Library]].

== Contents of the collection ==
===Highlights===
Key objects in the collection include:
*The financial scandal of the 1720s, the South Sea bubble, with reports in the ''Weekly Journal'' or ''Saturday’s Post'' of how Parliament decided that if they left the country, the directors of the South Sea company "shall suffer death as a felon without benefit of clergy and forfeit to the King all his Lands, Goods and Chattels whatsoever."
*First advertisement for ''[[The Memoirs of Fanny Hill]]'' in the ''[[Whitehall Evening Post]]'', 6 March 1750, and then, in the issue of 17 March, a report of how the publisher was taken into custody and all copies were seized.
* Insight into English attitudes to contemporary events, such as when the ''[[English Chronicle|English Chronicle, or, Universal Evening Post]]'' used the unusual device of a headline –  FRENCH REVOLUTION!! –  for a whole page article on 18 of July 1789. It reported sympathetically on the fall of the Bastille four days earlier, including how the officers were decapitated in ‘a sad but necessary spectacle...a solemnity worthy of the highest admiration.’

The "'''Bushwhacked'''" [[MP3]] files are [[satire|satirical]] speeches created from parts of [[United States]] president [[George W. Bush]]'s orations.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} The recordings were created by UK comedian [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]], who has used similar techniques in the past, most notably in his edited version of the [[eulogy]] at the [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales]].

The first "Bushwhacked" MP3 was created in late 2001 after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. It begins: "Good afternoon. On my orders, the United States military has begun strikes against our staunch friend, Great Britain, Australia, Germany and France, Canada, more than 40 countries in the Middle East, Africa, Europe and across Asia. These carefully targeted actions are designed to attack the Islamic faith.  This military action is a part of our campaign against diplomacy, intelligence, freedom, clock, tyre, the freezing of food, and a lot of dance."

The fictional speech mixes political satire ("the White House, a place where American Presidents have become outlaws and murderers themselves") with absurdity ("to all the men and women in our military .. I gave a 4th grade girl with more than forty cunts") and highly explicit, vulgar language. The file is about two minutes long.

The MP3 was originally posted at the [[Warp Records]] website, which also posted "Bushwhacked 2" (the sequel), and released a 12" [[single (music)|single]] of the recording with [[remix]]es.

A sequel was released in February 2003 after George W. Bush's [[State of the Union]] address. It is less vulgar but otherwise similar in style and content, and exclusively uses elements of the State of the Union speech. The speech begins: "Mr. Speaker, members of Congress and fellow citizens. Every year, by law and by custom, we meet here to threaten the world. The American flag stands for corporate scandals, recession, stock market declines, blackmail, burning with hot irons, mutilation with electric drills, cutting out tongues, terror, mass murder, and rape. Our first goal is to show utter contempt for the environment." Bush's words are frequently interrupted by strong applause.

Again, elements of absurdity ("We must offer every child in America three nuclear missiles") are combined with the accusation of US complicity with terrorists ("One by one the terrorists are learning: We are building a culture to encourage international terrorism"), probably due to [[state terrorism]] in the like of economic espionage conducted by [[ECHELON]], which had been revealed by the [[EU parliament]] on July 11, 2001, the [[strategy of tension]] brought by [[Gladio]] due to [[Licio Gelli]] from the (former) [[masonic lodge]] [[Propaganda Due]], [[Operation Northwoods]], [[MKULTRA]], [[Project FUBELT]], [[Operation Condor]], [[Operation Satanique]], [[Operation Cyclone]] and the financing of the [[Maktab al-Khidamat]], which is the precursor of [[Al-Qaeda]]. Unlike the first "speech", this one also addresses the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] ("And tonight I have a message for the people of Iraq: Go home and die"). It ends on a dark note: "In all these efforts, however, America's purpose is more than to follow a process. It is to achieve a result: the end of the civilized world."

There is also a slightly different movie version of the speech, based on the State of the Union video footage. Cuts to the faces of the audience are used to conceal the cropping of the different elements of the speech. This appears as an [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter egg]] on a compilation [[DVD]] of material from ''[[The Day Today]]''.

Similar edits of speeches by [[George H. W. Bush]], entitled "Bush Speech (corrected), Parts 1 and 2", were released by the [[Evolution Control Committee]] on the ''Gunderphonics'' tape in 1994.

A version of the 2003 sequel, with instrumental background accompaniment added, was included on the 2005 [[Stan Ridgway]]/[[Drywall (musical project)|Drywall]] album ''Barbeque Babylon.''

The '''Catacombs of Rome''' ({{lang-it|Catacombe di Roma}}) are ancient [[catacombs]], underground burial places under [[Rome]], [[Italy]], of which there are at least forty, some discovered only in recent decades. Though most famous for [[Christianity|Christian]] burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed together, people of all the Roman religions are buried in them, beginning in the 2nd century AD,&lt;ref name="Toynbee:39-40"&gt;Toynbee: 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; mainly as a response to overcrowding and shortage of land. The Etruscans, like many other European peoples, used to bury their dead in underground chambers. The original Roman custom was [[cremation]], after which the burnt remains were kept in a pot, ash-chest or urn, often in a [[columbarium]]. From about the 2nd century AD, inhumation (burial of unburnt remains) became more fashionable, in graves or [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], often elaborately carved, for those who could afford them. Christians also preferred burial to cremation because of their belief in bodily resurrection at the [[Second Coming]].

The Christian catacombs are extremely important for the [[art history]] of [[Early Christian art]], as they contain the great majority of examples from before about 400 AD, in [[fresco]] and [[sculpture]], as well as [[gold glass]] medallions (these, like most bodies, have been removed). The [[Jews|Jewish]] catacombs are similarly important for the study of [[Secular Jewish culture|Jewish culture]] at this period.  A number of dubious relics of [[catacomb saint]]s were promoted after the rediscovery of the catacombs.

==Precursors==

The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], like many other European people, used to bury their dead in underground chambers. The original Roman custom was cremation, after which the burnt remains were kept in a pot, ash-chest or urn, often in a [[columbarium]]. From about the 2nd century AD, [[Burial|inhumation]] (burial of unburnt remains) became more fashionable, in graves or [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], often elaborately carved, for those who could afford them.&lt;ref name="Toynbee:39-40" /&gt; Christians also preferred burial to [[cremation]] because of their belief in bodily [[resurrection]].

==Christian catacombs==

The first large-scale catacombs in the vicinity of Rome were excavated from the 2nd century onwards.  They were carved through [[tuff|''tufo'']],&lt;ref&gt;

a soft [[volcanic rock]], outside the walls of the city, because [[Roman law]] forbade burial places within city limits.  The [[paganism|pagan]] custom was to incinerate corpses, while early Christians and Jews buried the dead. Since most Christians and Jews at that time belonged to the lower classes or were slaves, they usually lacked the resources to buy land for burial purposes. Instead, networks of tunnels were dug in the deep layers of tufo which occurred naturally on the outskirts of Rome. At first, these tunnels were probably not used for regular worship, but simply for burial and, extending pre-existing Roman customs, for memorial services and celebrations of the anniversaries of Christian [[martyr]]s. There are sixty known subterranean burial chambers in Rome. They were built outside the walls along main [[Roman roads]], like the [[Via Appia]], the [[Via Ostiense]], the [[Via Labicana]], the [[Via Tiburtina]], and the [[Via Nomentana]]. Names of the catacombs – like [[Pope Callixtus I|St Calixtus]] and St Sebastian, which is alongside Via Appia – refer to martyrs that may have been buried there.  About 80% of the excavations used for Christian burials date to after the time of the persecutions.&lt;ref&gt;

Excavators ([[fossors]]), no doubt slaves, {{citation needed|date=July 2017}} built vast systems of galleries and passages on top of each other. They lie {{convert|7|-|19|m|ft}} below the surface in an area of more than {{convert|2.4|km2|acre}}. Narrow steps that descend as many as four stories join the levels. Passages are about {{convert|2.5|x|1|m|ft}}. Burial niches ([[Loculus (architecture)|loculi]]) were carved into walls. They are {{convert|40|-|60|cm|in}} high and {{convert|120|-|150|cm|in}} long.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Bodies were placed in chambers in stone sarcophagi in their clothes and bound in linen. Then the chamber was sealed with a slab bearing the name, age and the day of death. The fresco decorations provide the main surviving evidence for [[Early Christian art]], and initially show typically Roman styles used for decorating homes - with secular [[iconography]] adapted to a religious function. The catacomb of [[Agnes of Rome|Saint Agnes]] is a small church. Some families were able to construct ''[[cubicula]]'' which would house various loculi and the architectural elements of the space would offer a support for decoration. Another excellent place for artistic programs were the [[arcosolium|arcosolia]].

==Decline and rediscovery==

[[File:Eucharistic bread and fish.jpg|thumb|right|The fish and loaves fresco, Catacombs of San Callisto]]
In 380, [[Gratianus#Empire and religion|Christianity became a state religion]]. At first, many still desired to be buried in chambers alongside the martyrs. However, the practice of catacomb burial declined slowly, and the dead were increasingly buried in church cemeteries. In the 6th century catacombs were used only for martyrs’ memorial services, though some paintings were added as late as the 7th century, for example a ''[[Saint Stephen]]'' in the Catacomb of Commodilla. Apparently [[Ostrogoths]], [[Vandals]] and [[Lombards]] that sacked Rome also violated the catacombs, presumably looking for valuables. By the 10th century catacombs were practically abandoned, and holy [[relic]]s were transferred to above-ground [[basilica]]s.

In the intervening centuries they remained forgotten until they were accidentally rediscovered in 1578, after which [[Antonio Bosio]] spent decades exploring and researching them for his ''Roma Sotterranea'' (1632). Archeologist [[Giovanni Battista de Rossi]] (1822–1894) published the first extensive professional studies about catacombs. In 1956 and 1959 Italian authorities found more catacombs near Rome. The catacombs have become an important monument of the [[Early Christianity|early Christian church]].

==Today==

Currently, maintenance of the catacombs is in the hands of the [[Pope|papacy]], which has invested in the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]] the supervision of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus on the outskirts of Rome.

Responsibility for the Christian catacombs lies with the [[Pontifical Commission of Sacred Archaeology]] (Pontificia Commissione di Archeologia Sacra), which directs excavations and restorations. Study of the catacombs is directed by the [[Pontifical Academy of Archaeology]].

==Typology==
Roman catacombs are made up of underground passages (''ambulacra''), out of whose walls graves (''loculi'') were dug. These ''loculi'', generally laid out vertically (''pilae''), could contain one or more bodies. A ''loculus'' large enough to contain two bodies was referred to as a ''[[bisomus]]''. Another type of burial, typical of Roman catacombs, was the ''arcosolium'', consisting of a curved niche, enclosed under a carved horizontal marble slab. ''Cubicula'' (burial rooms containing ''loculi'' all for one family) and ''cryptae'' (chapels decorated with frescoes) are also commonly found in catacomb passages. When space began to run out, other graves were also dug in the floor of the corridors - these graves are called ''formae''.

==List of catacombs in Rome==
The Roman catacombs, of which there are forty in the suburbs, were built along the consular roads out of Rome, such as the Appian way, the via Ostiense, the via Labicana, the via Tiburtina, and the [[via Nomentana]].

===Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter===
{{Main|Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter}}
These catacombs are situated on the ancient [[Via Labicana]], today [[Via Casilina]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], near the church of [[Santi Marcellino e Pietro ad Duas Lauros]]. Their name refers to the [[Christian]] martyrs [[Marcellinus and Peter]] who, according to tradition, were buried here, near the body of [[St. Tiburtius]].

===Catacombs of Domitilla===
[[File:Rom, Domitilla-Katakomben 2.jpg|thumb|Catacombs of Domitilla]]
Close to the Catacombs of San Callisto are the large and impressive Catacombs of Domitilla&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.domitilla.info/ Catacombs of Domitilla]&lt;/ref&gt; (named after [[Flavia Domitilla (saint)|Saint Domitilla]]), spread over {{convert|17|km|0|abbr=off}} of underground caves.

The Domitilla Catacombs are unique in that they are the oldest of Rome's underground burial networks, and the only ones to still contain bones.  They are also the best preserved and one of the most extensive of all the catacombs. Included in their passages are a 2nd-century [[fresco]] of the [[Last Supper]] and other valuable artifacts.

In 2017, a team under [[Barbara Mazzei]] of the [[Pontifical Commission for Sacred Archaeology]] uncovered frescoes dating to around AD 360. Using laser techniques, the team was able to penetrate the grime in order to reveal the frescoes on the ceilings of two tombs of imperial grain merchants. The frescoes also depicted the transport of grain from around the Mediterranean to [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]]. They discovered the images of Imperial grain merchants accompanied by two saints, possibly the martyrs Nereus and Achilleus from the time of Diocletian. This enabled the dating of the frescoes to the latter half of the fourth century.&lt;ref name=telegraph20170530&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Telegraph|last=Squires|first=Nick|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/30/laser-technology-uncovers-1600-year-old-christian-frescoes-romes/|title=Laser technology uncovers 1,600-year-old Christian frescoes in Rome's biggest catacomb|date=30 May 2017|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt20170530&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/arts/design/fresh-finds-at-romes-ancient-catacombs.html?_r=0|title=Fresh Finds at Rome’s Ancient Catacombs|last=Povoledo|first=Elisabeta|date=30 May 2017|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are almost 150,000 bodies buried in the Catacombs of St. Domitilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Catacombs of Domitilla|url=http://www.domitilla.info/docs/brochures/brochen.pdf|website=The Catacombs of Saint Domitilla|accessdate=13 May 2016|format=pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222070103/http://www.domitilla.info/docs/brochures/brochen.pdf#|archive-date=2016-02-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are the only catacombs that have a subterranean basilica; entrance to the catacombs is achieved through this sunken 4th-century church, at via delle Sette Chiese 282. In the past, the basilica had become unsafe, and was abandoned in the 9th century. It was rediscovered in 1593, and much of it was reconstructed in 1872.

In the beginning of 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svdcuria.org/public/infonews/curia/20nn/200n/0901cd.htm Contract]&lt;/ref&gt; at the request of the Vatican, the [[Divine Word Missionaries]], a Roman Catholic Society of priests and Brothers, assumed responsibility as administrator of St. Domitilla Catacombs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svdcuria.org/ Divine Word Missionaries]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catacombs of Commodilla===
[[File:Christ with beard.jpg|thumb|200px|Bearded Christ, from catacombs of Commodilla]]
These catacombs, on the [[Via Ostiensis]], contain one of the earliest images of a bearded Christ. They originally held the relics of Saints [[Felix and Adauctus]].

===Catacombs of Generosa===
{{Main|Catacombs of Generosa}}
Located on the Campana Road, these catacombs are said to have been the resting place, perhaps temporarily, of [[Simplicius, Faustinus and Beatrix]], [[Christian martyrs|Christian Martyrs]] who died in [[Rome]] during the [[Diocletian]] persecution (302 or 303).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comitatocatacombedigenerosa.it/public/post/the-generosa-catacombs-44.asp Comitato Catacombe di Generosa]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catacombs of Praetextatus===
These are found along the [[Appian Way|via Appia]], and were built at the end of 2nd century. They consist of a vast underground burial area, at first in pagan then in Christian use, housing various tombs of [[Christian martyrs]]. In the oldest parts of the complex may be found the "[[cubiculum]] of the coronation", with a rare depiction for that period of Christ being crowned with thorns, and a 4th-century painting of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]] and the old men in the allegorical guise of a lamb and wolves.

===Catacombs of Priscilla===
{{Main|Catacomb of Priscilla}}
The Catacomb of Priscilla, situated at the [[Via Salaria]] across from the [[Villa Ada]], probably derives its name from the name of the landowner on whose land they were built. They are looked after by the Benedictine nuns of Priscilla.

===Catacombs of San Callisto===
{{Main|Catacomb of Callixtus}}

[[File:Baptism - Saint Calixte.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A fresco of a baptism from the Catacombs of San Callisto]]
Sited along the Appian way, these catacombs were built after AD 150, with some private Christian [[hypogeum|hypogea]] and a funeral area directly dependent on the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]. It takes its name from the deacon [[Saint Callixtus]], proposed by [[Pope Zephyrinus]] in the administration of the same cemetery - on his accession as pope, he enlarged the complex, that quite soon became the official one for the Roman Church. The arcades, where more than fifty martyrs and sixteen pontiffs were buried, form part of a complex graveyard that occupies fifteen hectares and is almost {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} long.

===Catacombs of San Lorenzo===
Built into the hill beside [[San Lorenzo fuori le Mura]], these catacombs are said to have been the final resting place of [[St. Lawrence]]. The church was built by [[Pope Sixtus III]] and later remodeled into the present nave. Sixtus also redecorated the shrine in the catacomb and was buried there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-destinations.com/italy/rome-san-lorenzo Sacred Destinations - San Lorenzo]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catacombs of San Pancrazio===
{{Main|San Pancrazio}}
Established underneath the San Pacrazio basilica which was built by [[Pope Symmachus]] on the place where the body of the young martyr [[Pancras of Rome|Saint Pancras]], or Pancratius, had been buried. In the 17th century, it was given to the [[Discalced Carmelites]], who completely remodeled it. The catacombs house fragments of sculpture and pagan and early Christian inscriptions.

===Catacombs of San Sebastiano===
[[File:Catacombe 1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Catacombs of San Sebastiano - entrance.]]
{{See also|Catacombs of San Sebastiano}}
One of the smallest Christian cemeteries, this has always been one of the most accessible catacombs and is thus one of the least preserved (of the four original floors, the first is almost completely gone). On the left hand end of the right hand wall of the nave of the primitive basilica, rebuilt in 1933 on ancient remains, arches to end the middle of the nave of the actual church, built in the 13th century, are visible, along with the outside of the apse of the Chapel of the Relics; whole and fragmentary collected sarcophagi (mostly of 4th century date) were found in excavations.

Via a staircase down, one finds the arcades where varied cubicula (including the cubiculum of Giona's fine four stage cycle of paintings, dating to the end of the 4th century). One then arrives at the restored crypt of S. Sebastiano, with a table altar on the site of the ancient one (some remains of the original's base still survive) and a bust of [[Saint Sebastian]] attributed to [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]]. From here one reaches a platform, under which is a sandstone cavity ad catacumbas which once may have been named "ad catacumbas", thus giving this and all other tombs of this type their name. 3 mausolea of the second half of the 2nd century (but also in later use) open off the platform. The first one on the right, decorated on the outside with paintings of funereal banquets and the miracle of the calling out of Cerasa's demons, on the inside contains paintings (including a ceiling painting of a Gorgon's head) and inhumation burials and has a surviving inscription reading "Marcus Clodius Hermes", the name of its owner. The second, called by some "tomb of the Innocentiores" (a burial club which owned it), has a refined stucco ceiling, Latin inscriptions in Greek characters, and a graffito with the initials of the Greek words for "[[Ichthys|Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour]]". On the left is the mausoleum of Ascia, with an exterior wall painting of vine shoots rising from [[Kantharos|kantharoi]] up [[trompe-l'œil]] pillars.

A room called the "Triglia" rises from the platform, roughly in the middle of the basilica and cut into from above by the present basilica. This covered room was used for funereal banquets; the plastered walls have hundreds of graffiti by the devotees at these banquets, carved in the second half of the 3rd to the beginnings of the 4th century, with appeals to the apostles Peter and Paul. From the "Trigilia" one passed into an ancient ambulatory, which turns around into an apse: here is a collection of epitaphs and a model of all the mausolei, of the "Triglia" and of the [[Constantine I|Constantinian]] basilica. From here one descends into the "Platonica", a construction at the rear of the basilica that was long believed to have been the temporary [[Cemetery|resting place]] for Peter and Paul, but was in fact (as proved by excavation) a tomb for the martyr [[Quirinus of Sescia|Quirinus]], bishop of Sescia in [[Pannonia]], whose remains were brought here in the 5th century. To the right of the "Platonica" is the chapel of [[Pope Honorius III|Honorius III]], adapted as the vestibule of the mausoleum, with interesting 13th-century paintings of Peter and Paul, the Crucifixion, saints, the [[Massacre of the Innocents]], [[Madonna (art)|Madonna and Child]], and other subjects. On the left is an apsidal mausoleum with an altar built against the apse: on the left wall a surviving graffito reading "domus Petri" either hints at Peter having been buried here or testifies to the belief at the time the graffito was written that Peter was buried here.

===Catacombs of San Valentino===
{{Main|Catacombs of San Valentino}}
These catacombs were dedicated to [[Saint Valentine]]. In the 13th century, the martyr's relics were transferred to [[Santa Prassede|Basilica of Saint Praxedes]].

===Catacombs of Sant'Agnese===
{{Main|Catacombs of Saint Agnes}}

Built for the conservation and veneration of the remains of [[Agnes of Rome|Saint Agnes of Rome]]. Agnes' bones are now conserved in the church of [[Sant'Agnese fuori le mura]] in Rome, built over the [[catacomb]]. Her skull is preserved in a side chapel in the church of [[Sant'Agnese in Agone]] in Rome's [[Piazza Navona]].

===Catacombs of via Anapo===
On the [[via Salaria]], the Catacombs of via Anapo are datable to the end of the 3rd or the beginning of the 4th century, and contain diverse frescoes of biblical subjects.

===Jewish catacombs===
There are six known Jewish catacombs in Rome, two of which are open to the public: [[Vigna Randanini]] and [[Villa Torlonia (Rome)|Villa Torlonia]].

The Jewish catacombs were discovered in 1918, and [[Archaeology|archaeological excavations]] continued for twelve years. The structure has two entrances, one on [[via Syracuse]] and the other inside [[Villa Torlonia (Rome)|Villa Torlonia]]. The catacombs extend for more than {{convert|13000|m2|sqft}}, and date back to the period between the 2nd and 3rd centuries, and possibly remained in use until the 5th century. There are almost a century of epitaphs, but these do not show any examples of a particular relief, beyond some rare frescoes showing the classic Jewish religious symbols.

The other catacombs are not open to the public because of the instability of their structure and the presence of [[radon]].

'''Chinese jade''' refers to the [[jade]] [[mining|mined]] or [[hardstone carving|carved]] in [[China]] from the [[Neolithic]] onward. It is the primary [[hardstone]] of [[Chinese sculpture]]. Although deep and bright green [[jadeite]] is better known in Europe, for most of China's history, jade has come in a variety of colors and white "mutton-fat" [[nephrite]] was the most highly praised and prized. Native sources in [[Henan]] and along the [[Yangtze]] were exploited since prehistoric times and have largely been exhausted; most Chinese jade today is extracted from the northwestern [[provinces of the People's Republic of China|province]] of [[Xinjiang]].

Jade was prized for its [[scratch hardness|hardness]], [[toughness|durability]], [[Bianqing|musical qualities]], and beauty.&lt;ref name=fieryglo/&gt; In particular, its subtle, translucent colors and protective qualities&lt;ref name=fieryglo&gt;Fiero, Gloria K. ''The Humanistic Tradition'' 6th Ed, Vol. I. McGraw-Hill, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; caused it to become associated with Chinese conceptions of the [[Chinese soul|soul]] and [[Taoist immortal|immortality]].&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Henessey, Chapter II.&lt;/ref&gt; With gold, it was considered to be a symbol of heaven&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The most prominent early use was the crafting of the '''Six Ritual Jades''',&lt;!--Linked here. Kindly leave bolded til separate article.--&gt; found since the 3rd-millennium&amp;thinsp;{{sc|BC}} [[Liangzhu culture]]:&lt;ref&gt;Howard, 19-22&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[jade bi|bi]]'', the ''[[jade cong|cong]]'', the ''[[huang (jade)|huang]]'', the ''hu'', the ''gui'', and the ''zhang''.&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Henessey, Chap. IV.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the meanings of these shapes were not mentioned prior to the eastern Zhou dynasty, by the time of the composition of the ''[[Rites of Zhou]]'', they were thought to represent the [[tian|sky]], the [[di (Chinese concept)|earth]], and the [[Four Symbols (China)|four directions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopes|first=Rui Oliveira|date=2014|title=Securing the Harmony between the High and the Low: Power Animals and Symbols of Political Authority in Ancient Chinese Jades and Bronzes|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/586915|journal=Asian Perspectives|language=en|volume=53|issue=2|pages=195–225|doi=10.1353/asi.2014.0019|issn=1535-8283}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[Han dynasty]], the royal family and prominent lords were buried entirely ensheathed in [[jade burial suits]] sewn in gold thread, on the idea that it would preserve the body and the souls attached to it. Jade was also thought to combat fatigue in the living.&lt;ref name=fieryglo/&gt; The Han also greatly improved prior artistic treatment of jade.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lYYvsRdxsX4C&amp;pg=PA77 77].&lt;/ref&gt;

These uses gave way after the [[Three Kingdoms period]] to [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhist]] practices and new developments in [[Taoism]] such as [[Chinese alchemy|alchemy]]. Nonetheless, jade remained part of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] and an important artistic medium. Although its use never became widespread in [[Japan]], jade became important to the art of [[Korean jade carving|Korea]] and Southeast Asia.

==Name==
[[File:玉-oracle.svg|thumb|[[Oracle bone script]] for 玉 "jade".]]
The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word ''yù'' [[wikt:玉|玉]] "jade; gems of all kinds; (of women) beautiful; (courteous) your" has semantically broader meanings than  English ''[[wikt:jade|jade]]'' "any of various hard greenish gems used in jewelry and artistic carvings, including jadeite and nephrite; a green color of medium hue; made of jade; green like jade".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wenlin]]'' (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'' (2011) [https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/jade jade].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yù'' has referred to many rocks and minerals that carve and polish well, especially [[jadeite]], [[nephrite]] and [[agalmatolite]], as well as [[bowenite]] and other varieties of [[serpentine subgroup|serpentine]].&lt;ref&gt;Desautels, Paul E. (1986), ''The Jade Kingdom'', Springer, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jadeite is now known as ''yìngyù'' {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|硬玉}}}}}} (&lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"hard&amp;nbsp;jade") and nephrite correspondingly as ''ruǎnyù'' {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|軟玉}}}}}} (&lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"soft&amp;nbsp;jade"). The [[polysemous]] term ''yù'' is used in various Chinese ''[[chengyu]]'' "[[set phrase]]s, such as ''pāozhuānyǐnyù'' {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|抛砖引玉}}}}}} (&lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"cast aside a brick, pick up a jade") "offer banal/humble remarks to spark abler talk by others; sacrifice a little to gain much"—one of the [[Thirty-Six Stratagems]], and [[idiom]]s, for instance ''yùlì'' {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|玉立}}}}}} (&lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"jade standing") "gracious; graceful".

The [[Chinese character]] {{lang|zh|{{linktext|玉}}}} for ''yu'' "jade" dates back to circa 11th century BCE [[oracle bone script]] from the late [[Shang dynasty]], when it depicted pieces of jade hanging on a string. Chinese characters most commonly combine a [[Chinese radical|radical]], such as the "[[Radical 96|jade radical]]" 玉 or 王, that suggests meaning and a phonetic that hints at pronunciation. The "jade radical" frequently occurs in characters for names of gemstones (e.g., ''bì'' 碧 "green jade; bluish green" and ''shānhú'' 珊瑚 "coral"), and occasionally for words denoting "preciousness" (''bǎo'' {{lang|zh|{{linktext|宝}}}} "treasure" and ''bǎobǎo'' {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|宝宝}}}}}} "precious/darling baby").

==History==
[[File:Chinese - Cong - Walters 42340 - Profile.jpg|thumb|left|[[Neolithic]] [[Cong (jade)|''cong'']], 3rd&amp;nbsp;millennium&amp;thinsp;{{sc|BC}}]]
[[Image:Jade ornament with grape design.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jade]] ornament with flower design, [[Jin Dynasty, 1115-1234|Jin Dynasty]] (12th or 13th century), [[Shanghai Museum]].]]
Jade has been used in virtually all periods of [[Chinese history]] and generally accords with the style of [[decorative art]] characteristic of each period. Its deep significance in Chinese culture has deemed it worthy of being symbolic of ancient Chinese ethics and ideologies and also representative of the progression of Chinese culture &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230223706_Progress_review_of_the_scientific_study_of_Chinese_ancient_jade|title=(PDF) Progress review of the scientific study of Chinese ancient jade|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, the earliest jades, of the Neolithic Period, are often quite simple and unornamented ritual and impractical versions of the tools and weapons that were in ordinary use, often much larger than normal examples.  These are presumed to have been symbols of political power or possibly religious authority.   This religious nature of jade is often evaluated as connections between spirituality and the Neolithic societal structure that jade was produced in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopes|first=Rui Oliveira|date=2014|title=Securing the Harmony between the High and the Low: Power Animals and Symbols of Political Authority in Ancient Chinese Jades and Bronzes|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/586915|journal=Asian Perspectives|language=en|volume=53|issue=2|pages=195–225|doi=10.1353/asi.2014.0019|issn=1535-8283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bi (jade)|''bi'']] and [[Cong (jade)|''cong'']] are types of objects only found in jade in early periods, and probably had religious or cosmic significance. The ''bi'' is a circular disk with a hole, originally usually plain, but increasingly decorated, and the ''cong'' is a vessel, square on the outside but circular inside. In later literature the ''cong'' represents the earth and the ''bi'' the sky.

Jades of the [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]], [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]], and [[Han Dynasty|Han]] [[list of Chinese dynasties|dynasties]] are increasingly embellished with animal and other decorative motifs characteristic of those times, and craftsmen developed great skill in detailed low [[relief]] work in objects such as the [[belt hook|belt-hooks]] that became part of elite costume. In later periods ancient jade shapes, derived from [[Chinese ritual bronzes|bronze sacrificial vessels]], and motifs of [[painting]] were used to demonstrate the [[artisan|craftsman]]'s extraordinary technical facility.

During [[Neolithic]] times, the key known sources of nephrite jade in China for utilitarian and [[ceremonial]] jade items were the now depleted deposits in the Ningshao area in the [[Yangtze River Delta]] ([[Liangzhu culture]] 3400&amp;ndash;2250 BC) and in an area of the [[Liaoning province]] in [[Inner Mongolia]] ([[Hongshan culture]] [[5th millennium BC|4700]]&amp;ndash;2200 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Li 2003:3-15&lt;/ref&gt; Archeological finds have also unearthed jade objects in this province in the shapes of dragons and clay-molded human figurines, therefore symbolizing the existence of a developed social group along the Liao River and inner-Mongolia &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopes|first=Rui Oliveira|date=2014|title=Securing the Harmony between the High and the Low: Power Animals and Symbols of Political Authority in Ancient Chinese Jades and Bronzes|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/586915|journal=Asian Perspectives|language=en|volume=53|issue=2|pages=195–225|doi=10.1353/asi.2014.0019|issn=1535-8283}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As early as 6000 BC, [[Mount Du|Dushan]] Jade has been mined. In the Yin Ruins of the Shang Dynasty in Anyang, Dushan Jade ornaments were unearthed in the tombs of the Shang kings.

In the Chou Dynasty (1122-255 BC), the system of government had been completed and there were varying levels of departments within the government. Buttons of jade were utilized to differentiate the various levels of official society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D.|first=C.|date=1921|title=CHINESE JADES|url=|journal=Bulletin of the City Art Museum of St. Louis|volume=6|pages=32-47|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jade was used to create many utilitarian and ceremonial objects, ranging from indoor decorative items to [[jade burial suit]]s, reflecting the ancient Chinese belief that jades would confer immortality or prolong life and prevent decay. Jade spoons, spatulas, and pestles were used to make medicine  in order for the jade to bestow its special virtues onto the medical compounds&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

From about the earliest [[Chinese dynasties]] until the present, jade was sourced from deposits in western regions like [[Khotan]] and other parts of China like  [[Lantian County|Lantian]], [[Shaanxi]]. In Lantian, white and greenish nephrite jade is found in small quarries and as pebbles and boulders in the rivers flowing from the [[Kun-Lun mountain range]] northward into the [[Takla-Makan desert]] area. River jade collection was concentrated in the [[Yarkand River|Yarkand]], the White Jade ([[Yurungkash River|Yurungkash]]) and Black Jade ([[Karakash River|Karakash]]) Rivers. From the [[Kingdom of Khotan]], on the southern leg of the [[Silk Road]], yearly tribute payments consisting of the most precious white jade were made to the Chinese Imperial court and there transformed into ''[[objets d'art]]'' by skilled artisans as jade was considered more valuable than [[gold]] or [[silver]], and white more valuable than green. 

Jade became a favorite material for the crafting of Chinese writing materials, such as rests for calligraphy brushes, as well as the mouthpieces of some [[opium pipes]], due to the belief that breathing through jade would bestow longevity upon smokers who used such a pipe.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Steven. ''The Art of Opium Antiques''. Silkworm Books, Chiang Mai, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carving Techniques ==
The hardness of jade presented an obstacle to those who wanted to carve it and turn it into various objects&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;FitzHugh, E.  (2003, January 01). "Jade". ''Grove Art Online.'' Ed.   Retrieved 26 Nov. 2018, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http:////www.oxfordartonline.com/groveart/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000043200&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. In order to quarry nephrite jade, fires were placed next to the jade to heat it and water was thrown against the rock's surface&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. This rapid temperature change caused the jade to crack and wooden wedges were used to further break it down&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. However, this quarrying technique also destroyed the jade&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. The best way to extract jade in terms of it being in the best condition was to remove it from pebbles and boulders that were found in rivers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

Neolithic jade workshops, also known as wasters, have been found in areas where jade usage was evident and popularized &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=P.|first=Dematte,|title=The Chinese Jade Age: Between antiquarianism and archaeology|url=http://www.academia.edu/4745736/The_Chinese_Jade_Age_Between_antiquarianism_and_archaeology|journal=Journal of Social Archaeology|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|issn=1469-6053}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Most evidence of the development of jade technology and tools are taken from wasters and the discards and finished works present in these workshops &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. From the traces of jade left at these sites, one can see the evolution of crafting procedures from chipping and polishing to more advanced drilling and slicing &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  . Due to the toughness of jade, the chipping and polishing procedures differ drastically from regular stone &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. The only possible method of altering the shape or texture of this mineral dense rock hasn’t seen much change from its introduction to modern day as both times remain reliant on the abrasion method &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. In order to override the abrasiveness of jade and subdue it to molding, a jade-worker must use an object of higher abrasive factor &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. In the early day’s of jade carving, quartz, a mineral with a high hardness level, was the object of choice &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. At the beginning of the Song dynasty, a time of prolific technology growth, “red sand”, with a hardness level of 7.5 became the dominant tool of the industry &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. 

Since jade was considered to be rare and strenuous to work with, pieces of jade were minimally changed and scrap pieces were reused in some way&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. The coloration of the jade was a factor taken into consideration when deciding what form the piece of jade would take&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

==Categories==
Jade objects of early ages (Neolithic through Zhou) fall into five categories: small decorative and functional ornaments such as [[beads]], [[pendants]], and belt hooks; [[weapons]] and related equipment; independent [[sculptural]], especially of real and mythological animals; small objects of probably emblematic value, including the han (ornaments, often carved in the shape of a [[cicada]], to be placed in the mouth of the dead), and many examples of larger objects — such as the ''[[cong (jade)|cong]]'' (a hollow cylinder or truncated cone)

===Six Ritual and Six Ceremonial Jades===
{{see also|Chinese nobility}}
The '''Six Ritual Jades''' originating in pre-history were the ''[[bi (jade)|bi]]'' (a flat disk with a hole in its center), the ''[[cong (jade)|cong]] (prismatic tube)''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopes|first=Rui Oliveira|date=2014|title=Securing the Harmony between the High and the Low: Power Animals and Symbols of Political Authority in Ancient Chinese Jades and Bronzes|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/586915|journal=Asian Perspectives|language=en|volume=53|issue=2|pages=195–225|doi=10.1353/asi.2014.0019|issn=1535-8283}}&lt;/ref&gt;,  the ''[[Huang (jade)|huang]] (a flat, half-ring pendant), the ''hu'', the flat, bladelike ''gui'', and the ''zhang''. The original names, value and functions of these objects have invited much speculation. The [[Rites of Zhou|Zhou Li]], itself probably compiled in the [[Han Dynasty]], ascribes the circular ''bi'' as representing the heavens, the ''cong'' as representing the earth, the ''gui'' the east, the ''zhang'' the south, the ''hu'' the west and the ''huang'' the north. Although over two  millennia old these names and symbolism were given to these objects by much later writers, who interpreted the objects in a way that reflected their own understanding of the cosmos.

The original use of the "Six Ritual Jades" became lost, with such jades becoming [[status symbols]], with [[utility]] and religious significance forgotten. The objects came to represent the status of the holder due to the expense and authority needed to command the resources and labour in creating the object. Thus it was as the "Ceremonial Jades" that the forms of some of these jades were perpetuated. The "Zhou Li" states that a king (wang) was entitled to ''gui'' of the ''zhen'' type, dukes (gong) to the huang, marquis to ''gui'' of the ''xin'' type, earls (bo) to ''gui'' of the ''gong'' type, viscounts (zi) to a ''bi'' of the ''gu'' type and barons (nan) to a ''bi'' of the ''pu'' type.

In [[engineering]], '''compensation''' is planning for [[unintened consequence|side effect]]s or other unintended issues in a [[design]]. In a more simpler term, it's a "counter-procedure" plan on expected side effect performed to produce more efficient and useful results.  The design of an [[invention]] can itself also be to compensate for some other existing issue or [[Action (philosophy)|exception]].

One example is in a [[voltage-controlled oscillator|voltage-controlled crystal oscillator]] (VCXO), which is normally affected not only by [[voltage]], but to a lesser extent by [[temperature]].  A temperature-compensated version (a TCVCXO) is designed so that [[heat]] buildup within the [[enclosure (engineering)|enclosure]] of a [[transmitter]] or other such [[machine|device]] will not alter the [[piezoelectric effect]], thereby causing [[frequency drift]].

Another example is [[motion compensation]] on [[digital camera]]s and [[video camera]]s, which keep a picture steady and not blurry.

Other examples in [[electrical engineering]] include:
* A [[voltage source|constant voltage]] device compensates for low or high voltage in an [[electrical circuit]], keeping its output the same within a given [[interval (mathematics)|range]] of input.
* [[Error correction]] compensates for [[data corruption]].
* [[Gray coding]] compensates for errors on [[rotary encoder]]s and [[linear encoder]]s.
* Debouncing compensates for [[jitter]] in an [[electrical]] [[switch]] (see Contact Bounce section in Switch article).
* A [[resistor]] or [[inductor]] compensates for [[negative resistance]] in [[gas-discharge lamp|gas-discharge lighting]].
* [[Frequency compensation]] is used in [[feedback]] [[control systems]] to avert oscillations.

There are also examples in [[civil engineering]]:
* [[Expansion joint]]s in [[sidewalk]]s, [[building]]s, and [[bridge]]s compensate for [[Thermal expansion|expansion]] and [[Thermal expansion|contraction]].
* Various devices between a [[structure]] and its [[Foundation (architecture)|Foundation]] compensate for [[earthquake]] movements, either actively or passively.

== Railways ==

* On railways, steep gradients on sharp curves have an equivalent gradient slightly steeper than the stated value.  This is because of extra friction of the wheel on the rails, and because wagons stretch out on the chord rather than on the arc, and may thus cause trains to stall.  To '''compensate''', the gradient of [[ruling grade]]s is slightly reduced from say 1 in 50 to 1 in 53.

"'''Cross Road Blues'''" (also known as "'''Crossroads'''") is a [[blues]] song written and recorded by American blues artist [[Robert Johnson]] in 1936.  Johnson performed it as a solo piece with his vocal and acoustic slide guitar in the [[Delta blues]]-style. The song has become part of the Robert Johnson mythology as referring to the place where he supposedly sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for his musical talents, although the lyrics do not contain any specific references.

Bluesman [[Elmore James]] revived the song with recordings in 1954 and 1960–1961.  English guitarist [[Eric Clapton]] with [[Cream (band)|Cream]] popularized the song as "Crossroads" in the late 1960s.  Their [[blues rock]] interpretation inspired many cover versions and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included it as one of the "500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll".  ''Rolling Stone'' placed it at number three on the magazine's list of the "Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time" in recognition of Clapton's guitar work.

==Recording==
Little is known about Johnson's life and musical career,{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=106}} although his recordings are well documented.{{sfn|LaVere|1990|pp=46–47}}  In October 1936, Johnson auditioned for music store owner and sometime talent scout [[H. C. Speir]] in Jackson, Mississippi; Speir passed on Johnson's contact information to Ernie Oertle, who was a representative for [[American Record Corporation|ARC Records]].{{sfn|Komara|2007|p=56}}  After a second audition, Oertle arranged for Johnson to travel to San Antonio, Texas, for a recording session.{{sfn|LaVere|1990|p=15}}  Johnson recorded 22 songs for ARC over three days from November 23 to 27, 1936.{{sfn|LaVere|1990|pp=46–47}}  During the first session, he recorded his most commercially appealing songs.{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=131}}  They mostly represented his original pieces and reflected current, piano-influenced musical trends.{{sfn|Komara|2007|p=57}}{{sfn|LaVere|1990|p=21}}{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=149}}  The songs include "[[Terraplane Blues]]" (his first single and most popular record){{sfn|LaVere|1990|p=15}} along with "[[Sweet Home Chicago]]" and "[[I Believe I'll Dust My Broom]]", which became [[blues standards]] after others recorded them.{{sfn|Palmer|1981|p=125}}{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=188}}

A second and third recording date took place in San Antonio after a two-day break.{{efn|The two-day break in the San Antonio recording sessions may not have been voluntary; one account puts Johnson in jail after a run in with local police.{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|p=74}}}}  Johnson reached back into his long-standing repertoire for songs to record.{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=149}} The material reflects the styles of country blues performers [[Charley Patton]] and [[Son House]], who influenced Johnson in his youth.{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=149}}{{sfn|Komara|2007|p=58}}  The songs are among Johnson's most heartfelt and forceful,{{sfn|LaVere|1990|p=21}} and music historian [[Ted Gioia]] sees a shift in the lyrical themes:
{{quote|At the close of the San Antonio session, the darker, more apocalyptic side of Johnson's work emerges&amp;nbsp;... [he] evokes the themes of damnation and redemption, darkness and light&amp;nbsp;... glimpses into the musician's inner life, and all its attendant turmoils.{{sfn|Gioia|2008|p=179}}}}

"Cross Road Blues" was recorded during Johnson's third session in San Antonio, on Friday November 27, 1936.{{sfn|LaVere|1990|p=46}}  The sessions continued at an improvised studio in Room 414 at the [[Gunter Hotel]].  ARC producers [[Art Satherley]] and [[Don Law]] supervised the recording and used a portable disc cutting machine.{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=120}}  It is unknown what input, if any, they had into Johnson's selection of material to record or how to present it.{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|p=73}}  Two similar takes of the song were recorded.{{sfn|Komara|2007|pp=60–61}}

==Lyrics and interpretation==
 [[File:Crossroads marker.jpg|thumb|right|Tourism marker at intersection of historical Highways 61 and 49 in Clarksdale, Mississippi (one of several purported crossroads sites)]]
A crossroads or an [[intersection (road)|intersection]] of rural roads is one of the few landmarks in the [[Mississippi Delta]], a flat featureless plain between the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers.{{sfn|Palmer|1981|p=126}}{{efn|In Johnson's time, "cross road" was the preferred usage for "crossroads".}} It is part of the local iconography and various businesses use the name, such as gas stations, banks, and retail shops.{{sfn|Palmer|1981|p=127}}  A crossroads is also where cars are more likely to slow down or stop, thus presenting the best opportunity for a hitchiker.{{sfn|Wald|2004|pp=274–275}}  In the simplest reading,  Johnson describes his grief at being unable to catch a ride at an intersection before the sun sets.{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|p=76}}  However, many see different levels of meaning and some have attached a supernatural significance to the song.{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|p=76}}

Both versions of the song open with the protagonist kneeling at a crossroads to ask God's mercy, while the second sections tells of his failed attempts to hitch a ride.{{sfn|Schroeder|2004|pp=37–38}}  In the third and fourth sections, he expresses apprehension at being stranded as darkness approaches and asks that his friend [[Willie Brown (musician)|Willie Brown]] be advised that "I'm sinkin' down".{{sfn|Schroeder|2004|p=38}} The first take of the song, which was used for the single, includes a fifth verse that is not included in the second take. In it he laments not having a "sweet woman" in his distress.{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|p=77}}

The song has been used to perpetuate the myth of Johnson selling his soul to the Devil for his musical ability.{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|p=76}}  The lyrics do not contain any references to Satan or a [[Faustian bargain]], but they have been interpreted as a description of the singer's fear of losing his soul to the Devil (presumably in exchange for his talent).{{sfn|Schroeder|2004|pp=37–38}}  Music historian [[Elijah Wald]] believes that Johnson's verses do not support the idea.{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=274}}  Delta bluesman [[Tommy Johnson (musician)|Tommy Johnson]] promoted himself as having made a deal with the Devil and Southern [[folklore]] identifies a [[Crossroads (mythology)|crossroads]] or graveyard as the site of such a pact, which Wald identifies as likely sources of the myth.{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=274}}  However, musicologist [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] points out that Johnson was "fascinated with and probably obsessed by supernatural imagery."{{sfn|Palmer|1981|p=127}}  His song "[[Hellhound on My Trail]]" tells of trying to stay ahead of the [[Hellhound|demon hound]] which is pursuing him and in "[[Me and the Devil Blues]]" he sings, "Early this mornin' when you knocked upon my door, and I said 'Hello Satan I believe it's time to go'".{{sfn|Schroeder|2004|p=37}}{{sfn|LaVere|1990|pp=38, 41}}  These songs contribute to the Faustian myth; how much Johnson promoted the idea is debated, although many agree "the 'devil angle' made for good marketing".{{sfn|Gioia|2008|p=164}}

Blues historian [[Samuel Charters]] sees the song as having elements of protest and social commentary.{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|pp=76–77}}  The second verse includes "the sun goin' down now boy, dark gon' catch me here", a reference to the "sundown laws" or [[curfew]] during [[racial segregation in the United States]].{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|pp=76–77}}  Signs in the rural South advised "Nigger, don't let the sun set on you here".{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|pp=76–77}}  Johnson may be expressing a real fear of trumped up vagrancy charges or even [[lynching]]s that still took place.{{sfn|Palmer|1981|p=125}}  Others suggest that the song is about a deeper and more personal loneliness.{{sfn|Charlton|2008|p=13}}{{sfn|Schroeder|2004|p=38}}  Writers Barry Lee Pearson and Bill McCulloch argue that the fifth verse in the single version captures the essence of the song: "left alone, abandoned, or mistreated, he stands at the crossroad, looking this way or that for his woman".{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|p=77}}

"Cross Road Blues" reflects Johnson's Delta blues roots and may have been in his repertoire since 1932.{{sfn|Pearson|McCulloch|2008|pp=75–76}} It is the first recording to show his mastery of his mentor Son House's style, particularly in his [[Slide (guitar technique)|slide guitar work]].{{sfn|Wald|2004|pp=155, 158}}{{efn|Johnson recorded two popular Son House songs, "[[Walkin' Blues]]" and "Preaching Blues", at the same session after "Cross Road Blues".{{sfn|Komara|2007|p=63}}}}  Music historian Edward Komara identifies parts of "Straight Alky Blues" by [[Leroy Carr]] and [[Scrapper Blackwell]] (1929) along with [[Roosevelt Sykes]]' subsequent adaptation as "Black River Blues" (1930) as melodic precedents.{{sfn|Komara|2007|p=59}}  However, Johnson infuses their relaxed urban approach with a more forceful rural one.{{sfn|Komara|2007|pp=60, 62}}  Komara terms Johnson's guitar playing a "blues harp style".{{sfn|Komara|2007|pp=54}}  It contrasts with Johnson's finger-picking "piano style", which uses a boogie-style accompaniment on the bass strings while playing melody and harmonies on the higher strings.{{sfn|Komara|2007|pp=44–45}}  Harp-style playing employs sharp percussive accents on the bass strings (an imitation of the sharp draw used by harmonica players) and allows Johnson to explore different chordings and fills.{{sfn|Komara|2007|pp=54, 62}}{{efn|According to Son House, Johnson began playing harmonica when he was 15 or 16 years old and "could blow harmonica pretty good.  Everybody liked it."{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=109}}}}  Johnson uses this technique for "Terraplane Blues", which shares many common elements with "Cross Road Blues".{{sfn|Charters|1973|p=51}}{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=155}}

The song's structure differs from a well-defined [[twelve-bar blues]]. The verses are not consistent and range from fourteen to fifteen bars in length.{{sfn|Headlam|1997|pp=71–72}}  Additionally, the harmonic progression is often implied rather than stated (full IV and V chords are not used).{{sfn|Headlam|1997|pp=71–72}}  Johnson uses a Spanish or [[open G tuning]] with the guitar tuned up to the [[key of B]].{{sfn|Komara|2007|p=59}}  This facilitates Johnson's use of a slide, which features as prominently in the song as the vocal.{{sfn|Komara|2007|p=62}} The slide parts function more as a second "answer" vocal than accompaniment, with the tension underscoring the dark turmoil of the lyrics.{{sfn|Wald|2004|pp=155–156}} Charters characterizes the song's rhythm as ambiguous, imparting both a [[4/4 time|4/4]] and 8/8 feel.{{sfn|Charters|1973|p=51}}  Music writer Dave Headlam elaborates on Johnson's rhythm:
{{quote|Meter itself is a compositional and performance device which comes in and out of focus in response to the fluid rthyms and changing accents in the lower beats.  The irregular groupings extend to smaller beat divisions, with an interplay between triplet 'swing' and duple divisions of the beat&amp;nbsp;... Johnson's irregular rhythms and variation in support of the metric beat suggest a more personal, idiosyncratic vision.{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=72}}}}
The two takes of the song are performed at moderate, but somewhat different tempos.{{sfn|Komara|2007|pp=60–61}}  Both begin slower and speed up; the first is about 106 [[beats per minute]] (bpm), while the second is about 96 bpm.{{sfn|Komara|2007|pp=60–61}}  Johnson prepares to go into the fifth section for the slower second take, but the engineer apparently cut him off because of the [[Gramophone record#78 rpm recording time|time limits of ten-inch 78&amp;nbsp;rpm record]]s.{{sfn|Wald|2004|p=156}}  In addition to the slower tempo, Johnson sings the verses at a lower pitch, although both takes are in the same key.{{sfn|Komara|2007|p=61}}  This allows for greater variation and nuance in the vocal.{{sfn|Komara|2007|p=61}}  Together with refinements to some guitar parts, the differences serve to help further distinguish the second take from "Terraplane Blues" and give it more of its own character.{{sfn|Komara|2007|p=62}}

==Releases==
ARC and [[Vocalion Records]] issued the first take of "Cross Road Blues" in May 1937 on the then standard 78&amp;nbsp;rpm record.{{sfn|LaVere|1990|p=46}}  The single, with its flip side "[[Ramblin' on My Mind]]", sold poorly.{{sfn|Palmer|1981|p=128}} The song remained out of print after its initial release until ''[[The Complete Recordings (Robert Johnson album)|The Complete Recordings]]'' box set in 1990.{{sfn|LaVere|1990|p=46}} The second take was released in 1961, when producer [[Frank Driggs]] substituted it for the original on Johnson's first [[LP album|long-playing record album]] compilation ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]''.&lt;ref name="O'Neal"/&gt; This take was also included on the 1990 ''Complete Recordings'' (at 2:29, it is 10 seconds shorter than the original 2:39 single version).{{sfn|LaVere|1990|p=46, back cover}}

==Elmore James versions==
American blues singer and guitarist [[Elmore James]], who popularized Robert Johnson's "[[Dust My Broom]]", recorded two variations on "Cross Road Blues".{{sfn|Charters|1973|p=51}}  Both titled "Standing at the Crossroads", they feature James' trademark "Dust My Broom" amplified slide-guitar figure and a backing ensemble.  James' lyrics focus on the lost-love aspect of the song:{{sfn|Charters|1973|p=51}}
{{poemquote|Well I was standin' at the crossroad, and my baby not around (2×)
Well I begin to wonder, 'Is poor Elmore sinkin' down'}}
James first recorded the song in August 1954 at [[Modern Records]]' new studio in Culver City, California.{{sfn|Topping|1993|p=15}}  [[Maxwell Davis]] supervised the session and a group of professional studio musicians provided the backup.{{sfn|Topping|1993|p=15}}  The song was produced in a newer style that Modern used successfully for [[B.B. King]] and James' slide guitar was placed further back in the mix.{{sfn|Topping|1993|p=15}}  [[Flair Records]], another of the [[Bihari brothers]]' Modern labels, released the single, backed with "Sunny Land".{{sfn|Topping|1993|p=15}}  The song became a regional hit, but did not reach the national charts.{{sfn|Topping|1993|p=15}}  Labels associated with Modern included "Standing at the Crossroads" on several James compilation albums, such as ''Blues After Hours'' ([[Crown Records|Crown]]), ''The Blues in My Heart – The Rhythm in My Soul'' ([[Custom Records]]), and ''Original Folk Blues'' ([[Kent Records]]).{{sfn|Topping|1993|p=36}}

In 1959, producer [[Bobby Robinson (record producer)|Bobby Robinson]] signed James to his [[Fury Records|Fury]]/[[Fire Records|Fire]]/[[Enjoy Records|Enjoy]] group of labels.{{sfn|Morris|Haig|1992|p=12}}  In addition to new material, Robinson had James revisit several of his older songs, including "Standing at the Crossroads".{{sfn|Morris|Haig|1992|p=13}}  James re-recorded it at Beltone Studios in New York City in late 1960 or early 1961 during one of his last sessions.{{sfn|Morris|Haig|1992|p=13}}  Studio musicians again provided the backup and the horn section included baritone saxophone by [[Paul Williams (saxophonist)|Paul Williams]].{{sfn|Morris|Haig|1992|p=13}}  [[Bell Records]]' subsidiary labels released the song after James' death in 1965 – Flashback Records released a single with a reissue of "[[The Sky Is Crying (song)|The Sky Is Crying]]" and Sphere Sound Records included it on a James compilation album also titled ''The Sky Is Crying''.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Homesick James]], who recorded and toured with his cousin Elmore,{{sfn|Dahl|2002|pp=2–3}} also recorded a rendition titled "Crossroads".{{sfn|Charters|1973|p=51}}  Homesick derived his guitar style from Elmore, which music critic Bill Dahl describes as "aggressive, sometimes chaotic slide work".{{sfn|Dahl|2002|pp=2–3}}  Unlike Elmore, however, he uses most of the lyrics from Johnson's second take, which had been first issued in 1961.{{sfn|Dahl|2002|pp=2–3}}  The July 23, 1963, recording session produced Homesick's only single for Chicago-based [[USA Records]], "Crossroads" backed with "My Baby's Sweet".{{sfn|Dahl|2002|pp=2–3}}

==Eric Clapton/Cream interpretation==
{{anchor|Crossroads (Eric Clapton cover)}}
===Background===
In early 1966, while still with [[John Mayall's Bluesbreakers]], [[Eric Clapton]] adapted the song for a recording session with an ''ad hoc'' studio group, dubbed [[Eric Clapton and the Powerhouse]].{{sfn|Roberty|1993|p=24}}  [[Elektra Records]] producer [[Joe Boyd]] brought together [[Steve Winwood]] on vocals, Clapton on guitar, [[Jack Bruce]] on bass guitar, [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]] on harmonica, Ben Palmer on piano, and [[Pete York]] on drums for the project.{{sfn|Roberty|1993|p=24}}  Boyd recalled that he and Clapton reviewed potential songs; Clapton wanted to record [[Albert King]]'s "[[Crosscut Saw (song)|Crosscut Saw]]", but Boyd preferred to adapt an older country blues.{{sfn|Boyd|2010|p=111}}  Their attention turned to Robert Johnson songs and Boyd proposed "Crossroads"{{efn|Boyd refers to Johnson's song as "Standing at the Crossroads".{{sfn|Boyd|2010|p=111}}}} and Clapton chose "[[Traveling Riverside Blues]]".{{sfn|Boyd|2010|pp=111–112}}{{efn|"Traveling Riverside Blues", like the second take of "Cross Road Blues", was first issued in 1961 on Johnson's ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]'' compilation.{{sfn|LaVere|1990|pp=46–47}}}}

For the recording, Clapton developed an arrangement using lyrics from both songs with an adaption of the guitar line from the latter.{{sfn|Boyd|2010|p=112}}{{efn|[[Led Zeppelin]] later used lyrics from "Traveling Riverside Blues" with [[Howlin' Wolf]]'s "[[Killing Floor (Howlin' Wolf song)|Killing Floor]]" set to a rock arrangement for "[[The Lemon Song]]".&lt;ref&gt;

"Crossroads" became a part of Cream's repertoire when Clapton began performing with Jack Bruce and [[Ginger Baker]] in July 1966. Their version features a prominent guitar [[Riff|riff]] with hard-driving, upbeat instrumental backing and soloing.&lt;ref name="Gilliam"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Headlam|1997|pp=71–72}}   Clapton previously recorded "[[Ramblin' on My Mind]]" with Mayall and "[[From Four Until Late]]" with Cream using arrangements that followed Johnson's original songs more closely.{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|p=99}}  However, he envisioned "Crossroads" as a [[rock (music)|rock]] song:
{{quote|It became, then, a question of finding something that had a riff, a form that could be interpreted, simply, in a band format.  In 'Crossroads' there was a very definite riff.  He [Johnson]  was playing it full-chorded with the slide as well.  I just took it on a single string or two strings and embellished it.  Out of all of the songs it was the easiest for me to see as a rock and roll vehicle.{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=69}}}}
Clapton simplifies Johnson's guitar line and sets it to a straight [[eighth-note]] or rock rhythm.{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=69}}  He and Bruce on bass continuously emphasize the riff throughout the song to give it a strong and regular [[Meter (music)#Meter in song|metric drive]] combined with Baker's drumming.{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=71}}  Johnson's irregular [[Bar (music)|measures]] are also standardized to typical [[Twelve-bar blues|twelve-bar]] sections in which the I–IV–V [[Chord progression#Blues changes|blues progression]] is clearly stated.{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=71}}  Clapton does not adapt Johnson's slide guitar technique or open tuning; instead he follows the electric guitar soloing approach of B.B. King and [[Albert King]].{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=71}}  However, he employs a Johnson guitar innovation, the duple shuffle [[Figure (music)|pattern]] or [[boogie]] [[Walking bass|bass line]], while singing (Johnson only used it for two bars in "Cross Road Blues").{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=71}}{{efn|Johnson first recorded an adaptation of the boogie bass line for guitar in "Dust My Broom".{{sfn|Wald|2004|pp=136–137}}  Later, Elmore James used it for the rhythm guitar parts on "Standing at the Crossroads".}}

Clapton also simplifies and standardizes Johnson's vocal lines.{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=71}} Schumacher calls Clapton's vocal on "Crossroads" his best and most assured with Cream.{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|p=99}}  In addition to Johnson's opening and closing lyrics, he twice adds the same section from "Traveling Riverside Blues":{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=91}}
{{poemquote|I'm going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side (2×)
You can still barrel house baby, on the riverside}}
During the instrumental break, Cream takes an [[Musical improvisation|improvisational approach]] characteristic of their later live performances.{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=72}}  Bruce's bass lines were aggressively driven, yet his lines were independent and unique. His blend rhythm and harmony complimented well with Baker’s drum fills and more complex techniques typical of drummers in [[jazz trio]]s.{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=72}}  However, the momentum is never allowed to dissipate and is constantly reinforced.{{sfn|Headlam|1997|p=72}}

===Recording and releases===
Cream recorded the song on November 28, 1966, for broadcast on the [[BBC Home Service|BBC]] ''Guitar Club'' radio program.&lt;ref&gt;

It appeared on bootleg albums before finally being released in 2003 on ''[[BBC Sessions (Cream album)|BBC Sessions]]''.  On March 10, 1968, Cream recorded it again during a concert at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] in San Francisco.{{sfn|DeCurtis|1988|p=23}}  The song became the opening number on the live half of Cream's ''[[Wheels of Fire]]'' double album, released in August 1968 by [[Polydor Records]] in the UK and [[Atco Records]] in the US.{{sfn|Welch|2000|loc=eBook}}  After the group's breakup, Atco issued the song as a single in January 1969,{{sfn|Whitburn|2008|p=100}} which reached number 28 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] pop chart&lt;ref&gt;

====Views on editing for album version====
Clapton biographer Schumacher notes "Given the passion of the solo performances on 'Crossroads,' it seems almost miraculous that Cream is able to return to the song itself."{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|p=100}}  Several music writers have explained that Cream's recording for ''Wheels of Fire'' was edited from a much longer performance that was typical for the trio – in the notes for Clapton's ''[[Crossroads (Eric Clapton album)|Crossroads]]'' box set, [[Anthony DeCurtis]] credits the trimming to engineer [[Tom Dowd]],{{sfn|DeCurtis|1988|p=9}} while critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] attributes the editing to producer [[Felix Pappalardi]], who "cut together the best bits of a winding improvisation to a tight four minutes", to allow the song's drive more continuity.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1985 interview, Clapton was asked if the song had been edited.  He replied:
{{quote|I can't remember.  I really haven't heard that in so long—and I really don't like it, actually.  I think there's something wrong with it. I wouldn't be at all surprised if we weren't lost at that point in the song, because ''that'' used to happen a lot.{{sfn|Forte|2010|p=29}}}}
However, Barry Levenson, who produced Cream's 1997 box set ''[[Those Were the Days (Cream album)|Those Were the Days]]'', asserts: 
{{quote|It's not edited, and I've got an audience tape from the same show which verifies that{{nbsp}}... That was a typical performance of the song.  I've listened to a lot of tapes, and all of the 'Cross Road Blues (Crossroads)' that I've heard come in at four minutes and change.  They never seemed to expand it beyond that.{{sfn|Hal Leonard||loc=eBook}}}}

'''Crucifixions and crucifixes''' have appeared in [[the arts]] and [[popular culture]] from before the era of the pagan [[Roman Empire]]. The [[crucifixion of Jesus]] has been depicted in [[religious art]] since the 4th century [[Common Era|CE]]. In more modern times, [[crucifixion]] has appeared in film and television as well as in fine art, and depictions of other historical crucifixions have appeared as well as the crucifixion of Christ. Modern art and culture have also seen the rise of images of crucifixion being used to make statements unconnected with [[Iconography#Christian iconography|Christian iconography]], or even just used for shock value.

In the first three centuries of [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian art]], the crucifixion was rarely depicted. Some [[engraved gem]]s thought to be 2nd or 3rd century have survived, but the subject does not appear in the art of the [[Catacombs of Rome]], and it is thought that at this period the image was restricted to [[heresy|heretical]] groups of Christians. The earliest Western images clearly originating in the mainstream of the church are 5th-century, including the scene on the doors of [[Santa Sabina]], Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 89–91, fig. 321&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] forbade crucifixion as a method of execution, and early church leaders regarded crucifixion with horror, and thus, as an unfit subject for artistic portrayal.&lt;ref name=Dreyer&gt;Elizabeth A. Dreyer, ''The Cross in Christian Tradition: From Paul to Bonaventure'', Paulist Press, 2001, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purported discovery of the [[True Cross]] by Constantine's mother, [[Helena (Empress)|Helena]], and the development of [[Calvary|Golgotha]] as a site for [[pilgrimage]], together with the dispersal of fragments of the [[relic]] across the Christian world, led to a change of attitude.  It was probably in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] that the image developed, and many of the earliest depictions are on the [[Monza ampullae]], small metal flasks for holy oil, that were pilgrim's souvenirs from the [[Holy Land]], as well as 5th-century [[ivory]] [[relief]]s from Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 89–90, figs. 322–326&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the [[Middle Ages]], early Christians preferred to focus on the "triumphant" Christ, rather than a dying one, because the concept of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|risen Christ]] was so central to their faith.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3728859|title=Donne and the Crucifixion|first=Julia J.|last=Smith|date=1 January 1984|publisher=|journal=The Modern Language Review|volume=79|issue=3|pages=513–525|doi=10.2307/3728859}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plain cross became depicted, often as a "glorified" symbol, as the [[crux gemmata]], covered with jewels, as many real early medieval [[processional cross]]es in goldsmith work were.

=== Eastern church ===
[[File:Meister des Rabula-Evangeliums 002.jpg|thumb|250px|The earliest crucifixion in an [[illuminated manuscript]], from the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Rabbula Gospels]], 586 CE]]
Early depictions showed a living Christ, and tended to minimize the appearance of suffering, so as to draw attention to the positive message of resurrection and faith, rather than to the physical realities of execution.&lt;ref name=Dreyer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Kevin Seasoltz ,''A Sense Of The Sacred: Theological Foundations Of Christian Architecture And Art'', 2005, Continuum International Publishing Group, pp. 99–110.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early history of the [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|church in Ireland]], important events were often commemorated by erecting pillars with elaborate crucifixes carved into them, such as where [[Saint Patrick]], returning as a missionary bishop, saw the place he was held captive in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Adomnan of Iona. [https://books.google.com/books?id=j7yFjie05bcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=life+of+saint+columba&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEvvnbkZLNAhUE44MKHQECA3oQ6AEIFDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Patrick&amp;f=false Life of St Columba], Penguin books, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Byzantine depictions such as that in the [[Rabbula Gospels]] often show Christ flanked by [[Saint Longinus|Longinus]] and [[Stephaton]] with their spear and pole with vinegar. According to the gospels, the vinegar was offered just before Christ died, and the lance used just after, so the presence of the two flanking figures symbolizes the "double reality of God and man in Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 93&lt;/ref&gt; In images from after the end of the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]], Christ is shown as dead, but his "body is undamaged and there is no expression of pain"; the Eastern church held that Christ's body was invulnerable. The "S"-shaped slumped body type was developed in the 11th century. These images were one of the complaints against Constantinople given by Rome in the [[Great Schism of 1054]], although the [[Gero Cross]] in [[Cologne]] is probably nearly a century older.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 99 quoted, 94–99&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western church ===
[[File:Cimabue 025.jpg|right|thumb|[[Crucifix (Cimabue, Santa Croce)|Santa Croce Crucifix]], {{convert|448|x|390|cm|1|abbr=on}}, by [[Cimabue]], [[Florence]], 1287–1288]]
The earliest Western images of a dead Christ may be in the [[Utrecht Psalter]], probably before 835.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 99 quoted, 94–99, 105–106&lt;/ref&gt;  Other early Western examples include the [[Gero Cross]] and the reverse of the [[Cross of Lothair]], both from the end of the 10th century. The first of these is the earliest near life-size sculpted cross to survive, and in its large scale represents "suffering in its extreme physical consequences", a trend that was to continue in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 141 quoted, 105–106, 141–142&lt;/ref&gt; Such figures, especially as [[rood]]s, large painted or sculpted crucifixes hung high in front of the [[chancel]] of churches, became very important in Western art, providing a sharp contrast with [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] traditions, where the subject was never depicted in [[monumental sculpture]], and increasingly rarely even in small Byzantine ivories. By contrast, an [[Altar crucifix|altar cross]], almost always a [[crucifix]], became compulsory in Western churches in the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;That it should be a crucifix was first specified in the [[Roman Missal]] of 1570&lt;/ref&gt; and small wall-mounted crucifixes were increasingly popular in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] homes from the [[Counter-Reformation]], if not before.

As a broad generalization, the earliest depictions, before about 900, tended to show all three crosses (those of Jesus, the [[Penitent thief|Good Thief]] and the [[Impenitent thief|Bad Thief]]), but later medieval depictions mostly showed just Jesus and his cross. From the Renaissance either type might be shown. The number of other figures shown depended on the size and medium of the work, but there was a similar trend for early depictions to show a number of figures, giving way in the [[High Middle Ages]] to just the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and Saint [[John the Evangelist]], shown standing on either side of the cross, as in the [[Stabat Mater (art)|Stabat Mater]] depictions, or sculpted or painted on panels at the end of each arm of a rood cross.

The soldiers were less likely to be shown, but others of the party with Mary and John might be. Angels were often shown in the sky, and the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] in some early depictions gave way to a small figure of [[God the Father]] in the heavens in some later ones, those these were always in the minority. Other elements that might be included were the sun and moon (evoking the [[Crucifixion darkness|darkening of the heavens]] at the moment of Christ’s death), and [[Ecclesia and Synagoga]]. Although according to the Gospel accounts his clothing was removed from Jesus before his crucifixion, most artists have thought it proper to represent his lower body as draped in some way. In one type of sculpted crucifix, of which the [[Holy Face of Lucca|Volto Santo in Lucca]] is the classic example, Christ continued to wear the long ''collobium'' robe of the Rabbula Gospels.
[[File:Giotto di bondone e collaboratore napoletano, crocifissione, 1328-1332 ca. 01.JPG|thumb|left|A crowded Gothic narrative treatment, workshop of [[Giotto]], c. 1330]]

In the Gothic period more elaborate narrative depictions developed, including many extra figures of [[Mary Magdalene]], disciples, especially [[The Three Marys]] behind the Virgin Mary, soldiers often including an officer on a horse, and angels in the sky. The moment when [[Saint Longinus|Longinus the centurion]] pierces Christ with his spear (the "[[Holy Lance]]") is often shown, and the blood and water spurting from Christ's side is often caught in a chalice held by an angel. In larger images the other two crosses might return, but most often not. In some works [[donor portrait]]s were included in the scene.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 151–158&lt;/ref&gt; Such depictions begin in the late 12th century, and become common where space allows in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 151–152&lt;/ref&gt;

Related scenes such as the ''[[Descent from the Cross|Deposition of Christ]]'', ''[[Entombment of Christ]]'' and ''Nailing of Christ to the Cross'' developed.  In the Late Middle Ages, increasingly intense and realistic representations of suffering were shown,&lt;ref&gt;Irene Earls, ''Renaissance Art: A Topical Dictionary'', 1987, Greenwood Press, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the development of highly emotional [[andachtsbilder]] subjects and devotional trends such as [[German mysticism]]; some, like the [[Trinity#The Trinity in art|Throne of Mercy]], [[Man of Sorrows]] and [[Pietà]], related to the Crucifixion.  The same trend affected the depiction of other figures, notably in the "[[Swoon of the Virgin]]", who is very commonly shown fainting in paintings of between 1300 and 1500, though this depiction was attacked by theologians in the 16th century, and became unusual.  After typically more tranquil depictions during the [[Italian Renaissance]]—though not its [[Northern Renaissance|Northern equivalent]], which produced works such as the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]]—there was a return to intense emotionalism in the [[Baroque]], in works such as [[Peter Paul Rubens]]'s [[The Elevation of the Cross (Rubens)|''Elevation of the Cross'']].

The scene always formed part of a cycle of images of the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' after about 600 (though it is noticeably absent before) and usually in one of the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]''; the presence of Saint John made it a common subject for altarpieces in churches dedicated to him. From the late Middle Ages various new contexts for images were devised, from such large scale monuments as the [[Calvary (sculpture)|"calvaire"]] of [[Brittany]] and the [[Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy]] to the thousands of small [[wayside shrine]]s still found in many parts of Catholic Europe, and the [[Stations of the Cross]] in the majority of Catholic churches.

=== Popular art ===
Crucifixion in popular art, as with modern art, is sometimes used for its shock value. For example, a World War I [[Liberty bond]] poster by [[Fernando Amorsolo]] depicts a German soldier nailing an American soldier, his arms outspread, to the trunk of a tree. Crucifixion imagery is also used to make points in [[editorial cartoon|political cartoons]].

== Passion plays ==
[[File:PassionPlay.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A passion play, Poland, 2006]]
{{Main|Passion play}}
Passion plays are dramatic presentations of the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. They originated as expressions of devotion in the [[Middle Ages]]. In modern times, critics have said that some performances are [[antisemitism|antisemitic]].&lt;ref name=Sennott&gt;Sennott, Charles M. [http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/04/10/in_poland_new_passion_plays_on_old_hatreds/ "In Poland, new 'Passion' plays on old hatreds"], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', April 10, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film and television ==

=== Film ===
Numerous movies have been produced which depict the crucifixion of Jesus. Some of these movies depict the crucifixion in its traditional sectarian form, while others intend to show a more historically accurate account. For example, ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), was probably the first movie to depict the nails being driven through Jesus' wrists, rather than his palms. [[Mel Gibson]]'s controversial ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' (2004) depicted an extreme level of violence, but showed the nails being driven into Jesus' palms, as is traditional, with ropes supporting the wrists.

Although crucifixion imagery is common, few films depict actual crucifixion outside of a Christian context. ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960) depicts the mass crucifixions of rebellious slaves along the [[Appian Way]] after the [[Third Servile War]]. The character Big Bob is crucified by cannibals in [[Wes Craven]]'s horror exploitation film ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' (1977) as well as [[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|its 2006 remake]]. ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982) depicts [[Conan the Barbarian|the protagonist]] being crucified on the Tree of Woe.

The 1979 British comedy film ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' ends with a comical sequence in which several of the cast, including Brian, are crucified by the Romans. The film ends with them all singing the song "[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]". In this sequence, the characters are not nailed to the crosses, but tied at the wrists to the crossbar, and are standing on smaller crosspieces at foot level.

In the 2010 film [[Legion (2010 film)#Plot|''Legion'']], one of the diner patrons is found crucified upside down and covered with huge boils.

=== Television ===
Simulated crucifixions have been performed in [[professional wrestling]]. On the December 7, 1998, edition of ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Monday Night Raw]]'', professional wrestling character [[The Undertaker]] crucified [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/11494884@N02/1382011485/|title=Stone Cold gets crucified by Undertaker on Taker's symbol|work=flickr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 26, 1996, in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]], [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]], during a feud with [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]], instructed his [[Raven's Nest]] to crucify Sandman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrestlinggonewrong.com/video/sandman_crucifixion.html|title=Wrestlinggonewrong.com|work=wrestlinggonewrong.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other television performers have used crucifixion to make a point. The [[Australians|Australian]] [[comedian]] [[John Safran]] had himself crucified in the [[Philippines]] as part of a [[Good Friday]] [[Crucifixion#As a devotional practice|crucifixion ritual]] for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] show, ''[[John Safran's Race Relations]]'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/safran-crucifixion-disrespectful-immoral/story-e6frfkp9-1225699011366, Philippines villagers bewildered by John Safran comedy stunt]&lt;/ref&gt; Singer [[Robbie Williams]] performed a stunt on an April 2006 [[Easter]] Sunday show shown on the UK television channel [[Channel 4]], in which he was affixed to a cross and pierced with needles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywood.premiere.com/news/music/story/church_slams_williams_crucifixion_stunt/|title=Church Slams Williams Crucifixion Stunt|work=premiere.com}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[HBO]] television series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'' (2005–2007) contained several depictions of crucifixion, as it was a common torture method during the historical period the show takes place in.

In the 2010 ''[[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]]'' television series ''[[Spartacus: Blood and Sand]]'', Segovax, a slave recruit to the gladiatorial [[Ludus (ancient Rome)|ludus]] of Lentulus Batiatus, attempts to assassinate Spartacus in the ludus washrooms and is crucified for doing so "after being parted from his cock".

Crucifixion has been depicted in the television series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' (1995–2001), where its depiction has been cited in feminist studies as illustrating violent and misogynist tendencies within a messianic paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Kathleen|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14680770701477966|title=Xena On The Cross|journal=Feminist Media Studies|accessdate=December 12, 2011|year=2007|volume=7|issue=3|pages=313–332|doi=10.1080/14680770701477966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] series "Vikings", the character Æthelstan, after being captured by the Saxons and named an apostate, is shown wearing a crown of thorns and being nailed to a cross. After the cross is raised he is taken down at the order of King Ecbert.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The Japanese science fiction series [[Neon Genesis Evangelion]] features crucifixion as a recurring motif.

== Music ==

=== Classical music ===
[[File:Weyden Christ on the Cross with Mary and St John.jpg|thumb|right|In music, ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' refers to compositions of a [[hymn]] of the same name, while ''[[Stabat Mater (art)|Stabat Mater]]'' in art is a specific form of depiction, as in this painting by [[Rogier van der Weyden]], circa 1460.]]
{{Main|Passion music}}
Famous depictions of crucifixion in classical music include the ''[[St John Passion]]'' and ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], and [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]]'s setting of ''[[Stabat Mater]]''. Notable recent settings include the [[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|''St. Luke Passion'']] (1965) by Polish composer [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] and the [[Passio (Pärt)|''St. John Passion'']] (1982) by Estonian composer [[Arvo Pärt]]. The 2000 work, ''[[La Pasión según San Marcos (Golijov)|La Pasión según San Marcos]]'' (St. Mark Passion) by Argentinian Jewish composer [[Osvaldo Golijov]], was named one of the top classical compositions of the decade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121772989&amp;ps=bb2|accessdate=April 2, 2010|first=Tom|last=Huizenga|title=The Decade In Classical Recordings|date=December 27, 2009|publisher=[[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] of traditional passion motifs with [[Music of Cuba#African heritage|Afro-Cuban]], [[Tango music|tango]], [[Capoeira]], and [[Kaddish]] themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onpointradio.org/2010/04/osvaldo-golijovs-musical-passion|accessdate=April 2, 2010|title=Osvaldo Golijov's Musical "Passion"|date=April 2, 2010|publisher=wbur.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crucifixion has figured prominently in Easter [[Passion cantata|cantatas]], [[oratorio]]s, and [[requiem]]s. The third section of a full [[mass (music)|mass]], the ''Credo'', contains the following passage at its climax: ''"Crucifixus etiam pro nobis sub Pontio Pilato, passus et sepultus est,"'' which means "And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; he suffered and was buried." This passage was sometimes set to music separately as a ''Crucifixus'', the most famous example being that of [[Antonio Lotti]] for eight voices.

The [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|seven utterances of Jesus while on the Cross]], gathered from the four gospels, have inspired [[Musical settings of The Seven Last Words of Christ|many musical compositions]], from [[Heinrich Schütz]] in 1645 to Ruth Zechlin in 1996, with the best known being [[Joseph Haydn]]'s ''[[The Seven Last Words of Christ]]'', composed in 1787.

Depictions of crucifixion outside the Christian context are rare. One of the few examples is in [[Ernest Reyer]]'s opera ''[[Salammbô (Reyer)|Salammbô]]'' (1890).

=== Popular music ===
The 1970 [[rock opera]] [[Jesus Christ Superstar]] by [[Tim Rice]] and [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] ends with Jesus' crucifixion.

The cover art of [[Tupac Shakur]]'s album [[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]] features an image of Tupac being crucified on a cross. He stated that the image was not a mockery of Christ; rather, it showed how he was being "crucified" by the media.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Multiple [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] videos such as "I Don't Like The Drugs But The Drugs Like Me" and "Coma White" feature crucifixion imagery, often oddly staged in surreal modern or near modern-day settings. The Norwegian black metal band [[Gorgoroth]] had several people on stage affixed to crosses to give the appearance of crucifixion at a now infamous concert in [[Kraków]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jonathan Tisdall |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece |title=Norwegian black metal band shocks Poland – Aftenposten.no |publisher=Aftenposten.no |date= |accessdate=2009-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309110157/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece |archivedate=2009-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and repeated this act in the music video for "Carving a Giant." In 2006, singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] caused controversy by opening a concert held near [[Vatican City]] with a mock crucifixion, complete with a [[crown of thorns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=387254&amp;in_page_id=1773|title=Madonna under fire over mock crucifixion|work=dailymail.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henryk Siemiradzki 004.jpeg|thumb|300px|''An orgy in Imperial Rome'', by [[Henryk Siemiradzki]]]]
[[File:THOMAS COUTURE - Los Romanos de la Decadencia (Museo de Orsay, 1847. Óleo sobre lienzo, 472 x 772 cm).jpg|thumb|300px|''Romans during the Decadence'', by [[Thomas Couture]]]]

The word '''decadence''', which at first meant simply "decline" in an abstract sense, is now most often used to refer to a perceived decay in standards, morals, dignity, religious faith, or skill at governing among the members of the elite of a very large social structure, such as an empire or nation state. By extension, it may refer to a decline in art, literature, science, technology, and work ethics, or (very loosely) to self-indulgent behavior.

Usage of the term sometimes implies moral censure, or an acceptance of the idea, met with throughout the world since ancient times, that such declines are objectively observable and that they inevitably precede the destruction of the society in question; for this reason, modern historians use it with caution. The word originated in Medieval Latin ''(dēcadentia)'', appeared in 16th-century French, and entered English soon afterwards. It bore the neutral meaning of decay, decrease, or decline until the late 19th century, when the influence of new theories of [[social degeneration]] contributed to its modern meaning.

In literature, the [[Decadent movement]]—late nineteenth century ''[[fin de siècle]]'' writers who were associated with [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] or the [[Aesthetic movement]]—was first given its name by hostile critics. Later it was triumphantly adopted by some of the writers themselves. The Decadents praised artifice over nature and sophistication over simplicity, defying contemporary discourses of decline by embracing subjects and styles that their critics considered morbid and over-refined. Some of these writers were influenced by the tradition of the [[Gothic novel]] and by the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].

==History==
===Decadent movement===
{{Main|Decadent movement}}
[[File:Félicien Rops - Pornokratès - 1878.jpg|thumb|''[[Pornocrates]]'' by [[Félicien Rops]] (1878)]]
Decadence was the name given to a number of late nineteenth-century writers who valued artifice over the earlier Romantics' naïve view of nature. Some of them triumphantly adopted the name, referring to themselves as Decadents. For the most part, they were influenced by the tradition of the [[Gothic novel]] and by the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and were associated with [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and/or [[Aestheticism]].

This concept of decadence dates from the eighteenth century, especially from [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], and was taken up by critics as a term of abuse after [[Désiré Nisard]] used it against [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Romanticism]] in general. A later generation of Romantics, such as [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]] took the word as a badge of pride, as a sign of their rejection of what they saw as banal "progress." In the 1880s, a group of [[French literature|French writers]] referred to themselves as Decadents. The classic [[novel]] from this group is [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]' ''[[À rebours|Against Nature]]'', often seen as the first great decadent work, though others attribute this honor to Baudelaire's works.

In Britain and Ireland the leading figure associated with the Decadent movement was Irish writer, [[Oscar Wilde]]. Other significant figures include Arthur Symons, Aubrey Beardsley and Ernest Dowson.

The Symbolist movement has frequently been confused with the Decadent movement. Several young writers were derisively referred to in the press as "decadent" in the mid-1880s. [[Jean Moréas]]' manifesto was largely a response to this [[polemic]]. A few of these writers embraced the term while most avoided it. Although the aesthetics of Symbolism and Decadence can be seen as overlapping in some areas, the two remain distinct.

===1920s Berlin===
{{main|1920s Berlin}}

This "''fertile culture''" of Berlin extended onwards until [[Adolf Hitler]] rose to power in early 1933 and stamped out any and all resistance to the [[Nazi Party]]. Likewise, the Nazis decried Berlin as a haven of vice.{{Clarify|date=April 2008}} A new [[culture]] developed in and around Berlin, including architecture and design ([[Bauhaus]], 1919–33), a variety of literature ([[Alfred Döblin|Döblin]], ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'', 1929), film ([[Fritz Lang|Lang]], ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', 1927, [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]], ''[[Der blaue Engel]]'', 1930), painting ([[George Grosz|Grosz]]), and music ([[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill|Weill]], ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', 1928), criticism ([[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]]), philosophy/psychology ([[Carl Jung|Jung]]), and fashion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} This culture was often considered to be decadent, and socially, morally, destructive.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkus UK review of Laqueur, Walter ''Weimar: A cultural history, 1918-1933''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cinema of Germany|Film]] was making huge technical and artistic strides during this period of time in Berlin, and gave rise to the influential movement called [[German Expressionism]]. "[[Talkies]]", the Sound films, were also becoming more popular with the general public across Europe, and Berlin was producing very many of them.

Berlin in the 20s also proved to be a haven for English writers such as [[W. H. Auden]], [[Stephen Spender]] and [[Christopher Isherwood]], who wrote a series of 'Berlin novels', inspiring the play ''[[I Am a Camera]]'', which was later adapted into a musical, ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', and an [[Academy Award]] winning [[Cabaret (1972 film)|film of the same name]]. Spender's semi-autobiographical novel ''[[The Temple (Stephen Spender)|The Temple]]'' evokes the attitude and atmosphere of the place at the time.

==Use in Marxism==
===Leninism===
According to [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[capitalism]] had reached its highest stage and could no longer provide for the general development of society. He expected reduced vigor in economic activity and a growth in unhealthy economic phenomena, reflecting capitalism's gradually decreasing capacity to provide for social needs and preparing the ground for [[socialist]] revolution in the [[Western world|West]].  Politically, [[World War I]] proved the decadent nature of the advanced capitalist countries to Lenin, that [[capitalism]] had reached the stage where it would destroy its own prior achievements more than it would advance.&lt;ref name=libcom&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/decadence-aufheben-2 Decadence: The Theory of Decline or the Decline of Theory? (Part I)]. ''[[Aufheben]]''. Summer 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

One who directly opposed the idea of decadence as expressed by Lenin was [[José Ortega y Gasset]] in ''[[The Revolt of the Masses]]'' (1930). He argued that the "[[mass man]]" had the notion of material progress and scientific advance deeply inculcated to the extent that it was an expectation.  He also argued that contemporary progress was opposite the true decadence of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Mora, José Ferrater (1956). ''Ortega y Gasset: an outline of his philosophy.'' Bowes &amp; Bowes. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Left communism===
Decadence is an important aspect of contemporary left [[Communism|communist]] theory. Similar to Lenin's use of it, left communists, coming from the Communist International themselves started in fact with a theory of decadence in the first place, yet the communist left sees the theory of decadence at the heart of [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] method as well, expressed in famous works such as ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[Grundrisse]]'', ''[[Das Kapital]]'' but most significantly in ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy|Preface to the Critique of Political Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl (1859). ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy.''  Progress Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary left communist theory defends that Lenin was mistaken on his definition of imperialism (although how grave his mistake was and how much of his work on imperialism is valid varies from groups to groups) and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] to be basically correct on this question, thus accepting capitalism as a world epoch similarly to Lenin, but a world epoch from which no capitalist state can oppose or avoid being a part of. On the other hand, the theoretical framework of capitalism's decadence varies between different groups while left communist organizations like the [[International Communist Current]] hold a basically [[Luxemburgist]] analysis that makes an emphasis on the world market and its expansion, others hold views more in line with those of [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and most importantly [[Henryk Grossman]] and [[Paul Mattick]] with an emphasis on monopolies and the falling [[rate of profit]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16191">Despite being an imported tradition, [[Comics|comic art]] had a significant impact on [[Myanmar|Burmese]] visual culture.  Comic art is a form of visual expression defined by sequences of juxtaposed panels containing stylised images with bold outlines which incorporate text or symbols as an integral part of the narrative.  Introduced by members of the British colonial elite, who were also amateur artists, cartooning and comic art was embraced by Burmese artists as a new mode of visual and critical expression.  First appearing in the early 1910s, within two decades comics and cartoons emerged as a significant vehicle by which political and social criticism could be made within Burma's restricted public arena.&lt;ref&gt;Aung Soe Min, “Comic Culture in Myanmar: When Lines Shine a Light in the Darkness,” Goethe Institut, accessed April 30, 2016, https://www.goethe.de/ins/mm/en/kul/mag/20697882.html.&lt;/ref&gt;   As the number of print publications in Burma grew, from 22 in 1911 to 103 in 1921 and finally to over 200 by the close of the 1930s, comics became a substantial avenue for entertainment, art and discourse.&lt;ref&gt;John A Lent, Asian Comics (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2015), 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and influences ==
The first cartoon published in Burma appeared in the [[The Rangoon Times|''Rangoon Times'']] in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 175.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cartoon was created by Martin Jones, the British commissioner of Burma's railways.  It depicted a young [[Bamar people|Burmese]] woman who attended a Western party and was subsequently humiliated.&lt;ref&gt;Aung Zaw, “Pioneers of Burmese Cartooning,” ''Irrawaddy'' 11,  no. 7 (2003), accessed April 30, 2016, http://www2.irrawaddy.com/article.php?art_id=3069&amp;page=1.&lt;/ref&gt;   Jones published the derogatory illustration under the pseudonym Myauk, the derivation of the Burmese term ''myauk phyu'' meaning ‘white monkey’.&lt;ref&gt;Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 175.&lt;/ref&gt;   A term the Burmese used to refer to the British colonial forces who [[British rule in Burma|occupied Burma]] from 1824 to 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Thompson, “Burma,” in ''South East Asia: Colonial History - Vol IV'', ed. Paul H Kratoska (London: Routledge, 2001), 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones along with fellow amateur colonial painters physics professor Kenneth Ward and principal of St. Mathews High School in [[Mawlamyaing|Moulmien]] E G N Kinch founded the [[Burma Art Club]] in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Aung Zaw, “Burmese Cartooning”; Andrew Ranard, ''Burmese Painting: A Linear and Lateral History'' (Chiang Mai: Silkworm Publications, 2009), 91; cf Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 175, Lent suggests that the Burma Art Club was established in 1917.  This may be a confusion surrounding the date of the Club’s founding which occurred in 1913 and its formalisation which followed in 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;   Their efforts were assisted by Commissioner Hla Aung and his partner Mya May, along with several young Burmese artists including Ba Zaw, [[Ba Nyan]], Tha Dun, Tun Hla, and [[Ba Kyi]].&lt;ref&gt;Ranard, ''Burmese Painting'', 91-2; Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 175.&lt;/ref&gt;   Located on the grounds of the Rangoon Government High School,&lt;ref&gt;Irene Moilanen and Sergeĭ Sergeevich Ozhegov, ''Mirrored in Wood: Burmese Art and Architecture'' (Bangkok: White Lotus Press, 1999), 162.&lt;/ref&gt;  the Burma Art Club was a colonial art institution with the objective of promoting Western-style painting and drawing, including cartooning, to select Burmese students.&lt;ref&gt;Ranard, ''Burmese Painting'', 92-3.&lt;/ref&gt;   It has been suggested by art historian Andrew Ranard that: {{Quote|text=Burmese students who studied cartoon art at the Burma Art Club felt some affinity for this new genre because it possessed elements of exaggeration with which they were already familiar in Traditional painting… Pagan painting and the mural painting of Burma from the 17th to 19th centuries had a strong taste for caricature in its depictions of fairy-tale figures, demons, and beasts…&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}} Among the first initiates to receive training from the establishment were the now notable Burmese cartoonists [[Shwe Yoe|Ba Gale]], also known as Shwe Talay or Shwe Yoe, and [[Ba Gyan]].&lt;ref&gt;Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 175.&lt;/ref&gt;   It is considered that the beginning of Burma's comic art movement was defined by these individuals.&lt;ref&gt;John A Lent, “Cartooning in Southeast Asia,” in ''Encyclopedia of Humour Studies'', ed. Salvatore Attardo  (Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications, 2014), 725.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ba Gale ==
{{Main|Shwe Yoe}}Ba Gale (1893-1945) was a formative figure in Burma's burgeoning comic art scene.  His career began in 1915, after publishing a cartoon in the ''Rangoon College Annual Magazine'' at the age of 22.&lt;ref&gt;Aung Zaw, “Burmese Cartooning”; Myo Thant, “Social Critics, Satirists and Humourists” (paper presented at the National Workshop on Copyright: Myanmar’s Gateway to IP, Yangon, September 7, 2005), accessed April 30, 2016, http://www.accu.or.jp/appreb/02/02-02/02-02country/previous/prev_mm.html.&lt;/ref&gt;   Crucially, he was the first artist to draw and publish a cartoon in the Burmese language, which appeared in ''Thuriya'', a publication run by young nationalists, in March 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 175.&lt;/ref&gt;   Earning 10-15 kyat per cartoon (approximately AU $0.17) Ba Gale sought to make cartooning his career.&lt;ref&gt;Aung Zaw, “Burmese Cartooning”.&lt;/ref&gt;   His works subsequently appeared in the [[The Rangoon Times|''Rangoon Times'']] and as part of the editorial pages in other smaller local newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ba Gale Shwedagon Comic.png|thumb|Ba Gale, Shwedagon shoe controversy comic, c. 1917]]

Ba Gale's style drew heavily from the European tradition of [[caricature]].  During his time at the Burma Art Club, he was introduced to and subscribed to the British comic publication ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', known for its political and social satire.&lt;ref&gt;Ranard, ''Burmese Painting'', 92.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite being acknowledged as an adept artist and an astute pictorial commentator, the Burmese public initially found it difficult to understand and interpret Ba Gale's exaggerated and stylised drawing style.&lt;ref&gt;Aung Zaw, “Burmese Cartooning”; Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 175;  This would seem to contradict Ranard’s assertion that elements of caricature could be identified in early Burmese temple paintings making the style familiar.  Perhaps the similarities were clearer for individuals with an artist training and background, such as the students of the Burma Art Club as opposed to the general Burmese population.&lt;/ref&gt;   Writer and social historian Aung Zaw notes that: {{Quote|text=To gain popular acceptance, Ba Gale’s cartoons were often accompanied by long captions or described poetically by editors.  During British rule, captions often appeared in English. Respected Burmese literary figure Sayagyi Thakin Kodaw Hmaing edited The Sun and wrote many captions for Ba Gale, contributing to the public’s appreciation of the cartoonist…&lt;ref&gt;Aung Zaw, “Burmese Cartooning”; see also Aung Soe Min, “Comic Culture in Myanmar”.&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Even in its earliest stages, Burmese comic art was political.  Despite being a regular fixture within the English-language periodicals that circulated throughout Burma, Ba Gale's works often parodied the British administration.&lt;ref&gt;Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 176; Aung Zaw, “Burmese Cartooning”; Aung Soe Min, “Comic Culture in Myanmar”.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he did not limit his critique to the colonialists.  He also used  comic art to critic prominent social issues such as opportunistic politicians and what he perceived as sycophantic behaviour towards the British.&lt;ref&gt;Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 176; Aung Soe Min, “Comic Culture in Myanmar”.&lt;/ref&gt;   Considered one of Ba Gale's most famous cartoons is his portrayal of the 1917 resolution to forbid colonial forces from wearing shoes within the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]]; an act which was forbidden by Burmese religious custom.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Moore, Hansjörg Mayer and U Win Pe, ''Shwedagon: Golden Pagoda of Myanmar'' (Bangkok: River Books, 1999), 150.&lt;/ref&gt;   Ba Gale illustrated the portly colonialists, identified by their opulent Western dress, riding on the back of Burmese people like horses so that they did not have to obey the custom of removing their shoes within the Shwedagon.  Ba Gale does not just lampoon the British and their disrespectful behaviour he also questions the attitudes of those Burmese people who assist them.&lt;ref&gt;Aung Zaw, “Burmese Cartooning”; Aung Soe Min, “Comic Culture in Myanmar”; Donald Seekins, ''Historical Dictionary of Burma (Myanmar)'' (Maryland: Scarecrow Press Inc, 2006), 136.&lt;/ref&gt;   Ba Gale, however, did not escape criticism entirely.  A cartoon which depicted [[Saya San|the leader]] of a 1930 peasant uprising as a hero earned him substantial condemnation from British officials, though he was never jailed.&lt;ref&gt;Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 176; Aung Zaw notes the leniency which cartoonists enjoyed under British rule, particularly when compared with the censorship imposed by the subsequent military juntas that ruled Burma from 1962 until 2010.  He considers that this relative freedom was an important aspect in the initial development of a Burmese comic art.&lt;/ref&gt;   Towards the mid-1920s Ba Gale transitioned into filmmaking and acting where he gained significant popularity.

== Ba Gyan ==
{{Main|Ba Gyan}} The political inclination first seen in Ba Gale's work was furthered by his contemporary Ba Gyan (1902-1953) who rose to prominence in the 1930s with his bold cartoons and nationalist agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Bertil Littner, “Avoiding the Draft,” ''Far Eastern Economic Review'' 148, vol. 3 (1991): 32.&lt;/ref&gt;   Ba Gyan, like Ba Gale, also trained at the Burma Art Club where he was singled-out by founder Martin Jones for his ‘talent, humour and desire to entertain.’&lt;ref&gt;Aung Zaw, “Burmese Cartooning”; see also Ranard, ''Burmese Painting'', 92.&lt;/ref&gt;   Ba Gyan's practice traversed a number of fields.  In addition to working as an editorial cartoonist, he also illustrated children's magazines, worked as a commercial photographer, novelist and animator.&lt;ref&gt;Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 176.&lt;/ref&gt;   Ba Gyan was instrumental in establishing the Burmese animation industry.  In 1934 and 1935 he produced Burma's first animated films, ''Kye Taungwa'' and ''Athuya'' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 177.&lt;/ref&gt;   Previously, Burmese comic art had been restricted to single cartons or limited panel short stories, however, in 1937 Ba Gyan created Burma's first comic book, ''Ko Pyoo and Ma Pyone''.&lt;ref&gt;Myo Thant, “Social Critics”.&lt;/ref&gt;   At this stage Ba Gyan also began to work with recurring characters whose antics would be developed and explored across the political and humour panels of several major publications.&lt;ref&gt;Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ba Gyan Comic.jpg|thumb|Ba Gyan, ''[[Tatmadaw]]'' (Armed Forces) political comic, first published 1952. Text running upper centre to centre right translates to, '1952 - The plan to not split the people and the Armed Forces'.]]

After Burma gained its independence in 1948, Ba Gyan's comic production became explicitly political and highly critical.&lt;ref&gt;Seekins, ''Historical Dictionary of Burma'', 136.&lt;/ref&gt;   Of particular significance was a cartoon which appeared in a local newspaper on January 4, 1948.  The comic depicted British General Sir [[Hubert Rance]] departing Burma, waving goodbye to a local family as he tells them ‘Take care of your children.’&lt;ref&gt;Aung Soe Min, “Comic Culture in Myanmar”.&lt;/ref&gt;   Behind the amicable scene are three children each symbolising a damage caused by the Second World War: debt, destruction and economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ba Gyan's use of metaphor as a communicative device shows a growing sophistication and maturing in Burma's comic art movement.   Gallerist and collector [[Aung Soe Min]] claims that the cartoon's popularity stemmed from its ability to concisely express Burma's situation at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-independence Ba Gyan took a firmly partisan stance satirising both sides of Burma's new political regime; lampooning the [[Prime Minister of Myanmar|Prime Minister]] [[U Nu]] and the opposing communist leader [[Thakin Than Tun]].&lt;ref&gt;Aung Zaw, “Burmese Cartooning”.&lt;/ref&gt;   Aung Zaw notes that Ba Gyan's influence was respected and recognised by these figures.  By the early 1950s Burma was embroiled in political turmoil and on the cusp of a civil war, in a bid to quell a social uprising Prime Minister U Nu sought a meeting with Ba Gyan asking him to only exhibit cartoons which exhibited peace and unity.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;   Famously, he refused to compromise informing U Nu that he was too busy to attend the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;   Ba Gyan, and other early cartoonists such as Hein Sung, viewed their role as ‘public watchdog’s’ who were responsible for keeping the Burma's independent power structures in check.&lt;ref&gt;Littner, “Avoiding the Draft,” 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-independence Onwards ==
The proceeding period of development in Burma's comic art which spanned from the early 1950s until the [[1962 Burmese coup d'état|military takeover of 1962]] was an era of growth and experimentation in which younger artists expanded on the visual tradition established by Ba Gale and Ba Gyan.&lt;ref&gt;Myo Thant, “Social Critics”.&lt;/ref&gt;   Without the competition of television, periodicals inundated with comics became one of the major sources of entertainment particularly for the younger generation.&lt;ref&gt;Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 177.&lt;/ref&gt;   However, following the 1962 coup by the socialist, military leader [[Ne Win]], Burma's comic art with its fundamental political basis languished under the strictures of the junta.&lt;ref&gt;Seekins, ''Historical Dictionary of Burma'', 136.&lt;/ref&gt;   Comic art stagnated until the 1970s when developments in the book publishing industry helped to revive the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Myo Thant, “Social Critics”; Tin Maung Muang Than, “The Media in Myanmar,” in ''Media Fortunes, Changing Times: ASEAN States in Transition'', ed.

The '''Esquiline Treasure''' is an ancient Roman silver treasure that was found in 1793 on the [[Esquiline Hill]] in Rome. The hoard is considered an important example of late antique silver work from the 4th century AD, probably about 380 for the major pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Projecta; Cameron argues for about this date for the Projecta pieces, throughout; Shelton argues for "about 330-370", in Shelton (1985), 147&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1866, 57 objects, representing the great majority of the treasure, have been in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=32644&amp;plaA=32644-3-2 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two of the most important objects in the treasure are the ornate silver-gilt engraved boxes known as the ''Projecta Casket'' and the ''Muse Casket''. The treasure was part of the belongings of a wealthy Roman household of high social status, which can probably be identified. The collection includes 8 plates (4 circular and 4 rectangular), a fluted dish, a ewer inscribed for "Pelegrina", a flask with embossed scenes, an [[amphora]], 6 sets of horse trappings, with furniture fittings including 4 [[tyche]] figures representing the 4 main cities of the [[Roman Empire]]: Rome, [[Constantinople]], [[Antioch]] and [[Alexandria]], two hands clenching bannisters, and an assortment of jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, 44; Projecta and other BM pages; see External links for how to reach these&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a number of large late Roman hoards have been discovered, most are from the fringes of the empire (such as [[List of Roman hoards in Britain|Roman Britain]]), and very few objects from the period can be presumed to have been made by silversmiths in Rome itself, giving the Esquiline Treasure a "special significance".&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, 18-19, 44 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  This major hoard is displayed in room 41 of the British Museum alongside the [[Carthage Treasure]] and near the British finds of the [[Mildenhall Treasure]], [[Hoxne Hoard]], [[Water Newton Treasure]] and the [[Corbridge Lanx]]. It has been observed that the majority of the major surviving late Roman silver hoards are in the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, 9; at the start of his "Late-Roman silver plate: a reply to Alan Cameron" in the ''Journal of Roman Archaeology'' 6, 1993, Kenneth Painter lists (before the discovery of the [[Sevso Treasure]], which he implies should join the list) "the 5 surviving major hoards" of late Roman silver, of which four (Esquiline, Carthage, Mildenhall and the earlier Chaourse) are in the British Museum. The other was the [[Kaiseraugst Treasure]] in [[Augst]], Switzerland, [http://www.journalofromanarch.com/v6_first%20pages/lo-res%20PDFs/v6_06%20Painter.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of the Treasure==
[[Image:Esquiline Treasure (4).JPG|350px|thumb|left|Lid of the Projecta Casket]]
In the summer of 1793 workers encountered a large collection of silver objects during excavation work at the foot of the Esquiline Hill in Rome, which had been the area favoured by the Roman aristocracy for their houses throughout the Roman period. These items were found in the ruins of a Roman building, which was at that time in the premises of the monastery of San Francesco di Paola in [[Rome]]. The first official record of the finds was made one year after their discovery by the famous Italian classical archaeologist and later head of the Capitoline Museum [[Ennio Quirino Visconti]].&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, 44; Projecta and other BM pages&lt;/ref&gt;

The treasure passed through many hands before eventually being acquired by the French collector and one-time ambassador to Rome the [[Pierre Louis Jean Casimir de Blacas|Duc de Blacas]]. In 1866 his collection was sold in its entirety to the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, 44; Projecta and other BM pages&lt;/ref&gt; However, two other items in the treasure can be found in the [[Petit Palais|Musee du Petit Palais]] in Paris (a highly decorated ''trulla'' or saucepan),&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, #94&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Museo Nazionale]] in Naples (a jug in the form of a women's head).

==The Projecta Casket==
The so-called '''Projecta Casket''' (M&amp;ME 1866,12-29,1) is one of the most famous and magnificent examples of silver craftsmanship from [[late antiquity]] in Rome. It is partially [[gilding|gilded]] to highlight some areas, and was made by the [[repoussé]] technique - that is the ornamented relief was achieved by means of pressing or pushing back the metal surface. The box is 55.9&amp;nbsp;cm long, 28.6&amp;nbsp;cm high and 43.2&amp;nbsp;cm wide and has a weight of 8.2&amp;nbsp;kg. The base of the box has swinging handles at each end.&lt;ref&gt;Projecta&lt;/ref&gt;

The five panels on the lid of the box represent three mythological scenes, a double portrait and a bathing scene. On the top panel of the lid are half-length figures of a man and woman within a wreath held by standing [[erotes]] (or [[putti]] in modern terms) and an inscription which reads: "SECVNDE ET PROIECTA VIVATIS IN CHRI[STO] ('Secundus and Projecta, may you live in Christ').&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, #88; Projecta&lt;/ref&gt; The attire of the two figures is clearly that of an affluent couple from late antiquity. The woman is wearing a long-sleeved tunic with a large necklace. In her hands she holds a papyrus roll. The man is in a long-sleeved tunic that he wears under a [[chlamys]].

The four panels of the box itself depict bathing and dressing scenes, representing the preparations for a grand Roman wedding. These are placed between columns joined by alternating arches and bottomless [[pediment]]s, all under a [[frieze]] with scrolling vines.  In one scene, Projecta is shown sitting on an ornate chair holding a decorated box similar in shape to the Muse Casket. She wears a long-sleeved tunic under a [[colobium]] or short-sleeved tunic.&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, #88; Projecta&lt;/ref&gt;  A smaller inscription on the front rim of the lid gives the weight as "XXII-III", meaning "[Pondo] XXII,III [Unciae],S[emuncia]" or "Twenty-two pounds, three and one-half ounces" in [[Roman pound|Roman units]].&lt;ref&gt;Projecta, catalogue database&lt;/ref&gt;

The casket has travelled abroad to several international exhibitions: New York in 1977-1978, [[Rimini]] in 1996, [[New Dehli]] in 1997, [[Mumbai]] in 1998, [[Trier]] in 2007, Paris in 2009 and most recently Chicago in 2012-13.&lt;ref&gt;Projecta, catalogue database&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Muse Casket==
[[Image:Esquiline Treasure (3).JPG|thumb|left|300px|The "Muse Casket"]]
Another ornate object in the treasure is the Muse Casket (M&amp;ME 1866,12-29,2), which is a domed silver box, suspended on three chains. It is 25.4&amp;nbsp;cm high and 33&amp;nbsp;cm across. The outside of the box is decorated with [[relief]] panels showing eight of the [[Muse|Nine Muses]] alternating with decorative motifs. Inside the casket were found a set of five silver lidded bottles, or "four identical silver canisters and one silver flask" in the centre.&lt;ref&gt;Muse Casket in collection database&lt;/ref&gt;  These were presumably to hold perfumed oils for toiletries.  An apparently identical casket is carried by a female servant on the back panel of the Projecta Casket, suggesting that both were commissioned for the same wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, #89&lt;/ref&gt;

This casket is also well-travelled, exhibited in New York in 1977-1978, Rome in 2000, Milan in 2003, Paris in 2009 and most recently Chicago in 2012-13.&lt;ref&gt;catalogue database&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projecta and the Turcii==
The British Museum follows Kathleen J. Shelton in dating the treasure as a whole to the period 330-370; Shelton favours a period of some 20 to 25 years within that range, with the major objects from the same workshop, and probably for more than one generation within a family.&lt;ref&gt;"Muse"; Shelton, 147-148. The British Museum website in January 2014 follows the "Damasus" dating of "about 380" for the Projecta Casket, but Shelton's "330-370" for the Muse Casket and other items.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Current research suggests that the Projecta Casket and some other items in the treasure (but probably not all of them) were a wedding gift to the newly married couple Projecta and Secundus.&lt;ref&gt;Projecta&lt;/ref&gt; Projecta has been associated with an [[epitaph]] for a woman of that name who died in 383, shortly before her 17th birthday, written by [[Pope Damasus I]] (r. 366-84) that was once displayed in the church of [[San Martino ai Monti]], close to where the find was made. Though only nine lines long, and described by [[Alan Cameron (classical scholar)|Alan Cameron]] as "typically lame and frigid" (for a composition by Damasus) and "a tissue of tags and clichés shakily strung together and barely squeezed into the meter", the epitaph creates a number of puzzles and has generated much scholarly discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, 136-139 being his contribution; 136 and 137 are quoted in turn; Shelton, 148-150 disagrees with him&lt;/ref&gt;  The epitaph reads:

[[Image:Arte tardoantica da roma, brocca di 'pelegrina' in niello, IV sec.jpg|thumb|The Pelegrina Ewer; her name can be seen at the widest point, across the three "dimples" to the right]]

The translation here of "PROIECTAE FVERAT PRIMO QVAE IVNCTA MARITO" as "Projecta, who had been the wife of Primus" continues to be hotly discussed; ''primus'', meaning "first" was a Roman male name, but other possibilities are that Projecta had a "first" husband, or that her unnamed husband was ''primus'' or "first" in the complimentary sense of being "the tops".  Alan Cameron, who supports the Projecta of the epitaph being the wife of L. Turcius Secundus and the owner of the casket, sees ''primo'' as punning wordplay by Damasus - "second" was actually "first" in quality; he says this would be typical of Damasus's style.  Kathleen Shelton disagrees, seeing no connection between two different women called Projecta, one of the epitaph and the other of the casket, and supporting "Primus" as the name of the husband in the epitaph.&lt;ref&gt;Their two articles referenced here deal at length with these questions, and the arguments of each other.&lt;/ref&gt;

The epitaph for Projecta gives her father's name as Florus, who may be the important and pious Iberian official of that name who was close to [[Theodosius I]] (himself Iberian), and given great appointments at just this period.  He was part of a coterie of Iberian Christians close to the emperor, most seemingly related, which included Pope Damasus.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, 142-143&lt;/ref&gt;  Florus may be the figure of that name depicted with Damasus and a Simon and Peter in a [[gold glass]] cup in the [[Vatican Museums]] and in another with Simon (Simon appears in a further glass with Damasus), suggesting "a circle of friends, or at least associates".&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 210-211&lt;/ref&gt;

Two pieces of silver plate, a rectangular dish and a circular one were inscribed with a monogram that has been translated as standing for Projecta Turci. Based on this evidence, some scholars have suggested that Projecta was married to L. Turcius Secundus, and given her age this must have been not long before 383. However, not all the monograms seem to relate to this couple, and it may well be that the treasure represented the family silver accumulated over more than one generation. A ewer in the treasure is inscribed with the female name Pelegrina, but her identity has not been the subject of equal speculation, as there is no other evidence to go on. Another couple of a Turcius and Pelegrina has been tentatively suggested, though how their dates would relate to Projecta and Secundus is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, 135-136; Shelton (1985), 147-148&lt;/ref&gt;

While Projecta was evidently Christian, her husband, if he was L. Turcius Secundus, was a member of a prominent family many of whom remained pagans until the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Projecta; Cameron, 142-144; Shelton, 152&lt;/ref&gt; The ivory [[Symmachi–Nicomachi diptych]] from the same period and milieu in Rome shows pagan iconography; some 70 years after the conversion of [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] the old religion still had supporters in the Roman elite.  The four ''tyche'' of the main cities of the empire suggest they were made for the posts of a great official's chair or litter; members of the Turcii held several such positions. Cameron claims that the helmet of Constantinople is a form not found on ''tyche'' figures of that city before 380, when the see of Constantinople was suddenly raised to be second to Rome, above older ones such as Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, 140-141; disputed by Shelton, 152&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the treasure was buried at the Turcii house on the Esquiline Hill just before the [[Visigothic]] attack on Rome by [[Alaric I]] in 410 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, 44; Projecta&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian/Pagan Iconography==
In spite of the Christian inscription on the Projecta Casket, the [[iconography]] of the figurative decoration of the treasure is purely [[Ancient Roman religion|pagan]], a common mixture in Roman metalwork from the period to about 350, when [[Early Christian art]] had not yet devised iconography for essentially secular decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, 17&lt;/ref&gt; Three sides of the Projecta Casket's lid are decorated with pagan mythological motifs - these include the deity [[Aphrodite|Venus]] on a cockleshell, [[nereid]]s (sea-nymphs) riding a [[ketos]] (a dragon-like sea monster) and a [[hippocamp]] (a monster with the front quarters of a horse and the tail of a fish).&lt;ref&gt;Projecta in collection database&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture of Christian and pagan inscriptions and symbols may have been a compromise reflecting the affiliations of the bride and groom's families, described in the previous section.&lt;ref&gt;Projecta, catalogue database&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Frozen''''' is a 2010 American [[thriller film|thriller]]-[[drama film]] written and directed by [[Adam Green (filmmaker)|Adam Green]] and starring [[Emma Bell]], [[Shawn Ashmore]] and [[Kevin Zegers]].

==Plot==
Childhood friends Dan Walker and Joe Lynch, along with Dan's girlfriend Parker O'Neil, spend a Sunday afternoon at a New England ski resort on Mount Holliston. They are eager to take one last run down the mountain before they go home; however, the ski resort decides to close early because a storm is moving in.

The friends convince the ski lift attendant to let them on one last time. Before the group gets all the way to the top, the attendant is called into the boss's office and is replaced by a co-worker. As he leaves, he tells the co-worker that there are only three skiers left. Another set of three skiers comes down the mountain. When he sees them, he shuts down the ski lift, stranding the three friends in their ski lift chair far above the ground.

They take it as a joke, but the ski resort's lights are then turned off, leaving the three friends in fear and shock. Parker knows the ski slopes have closed for the week. Dan feels he has no choice but to jump from the ski lift chair and get help, as they will not survive up there in the bitter cold until Friday.

After discussing the danger, Dan decides to jump off the lift. Upon hitting the ground, he suffers a [[compound fracture]] on both of his legs. Soon, his screams and the scent of blood attracts a pack of wolves. Joe, now fearing for Dan's safety, decides to try to get to the ground by traversing the suspension cable between the lifts and [[steel]] support tower. However, as wolves close in on Dan, he returns to the chair and holds Parker as Dan is brutally torn apart by the wolves.

In the morning, Parker awakes with her hand frozen on the bar, which she grabbed during her sleep. She is also suffering severe [[frostbite]]. Joe discusses his previous life experiences with her, before attempting to traverse the ski lift cable, and onto a support pole on the other side. By doing this, he also causes the chair Parker is sitting in to dangerously loosen from the cable. After scaring off a pair of wolves by using a ski pole, he slides down the mountain on Parker's snowboard, planning to return with help. The wolves give chase after him. Joe never returns and Parker spends the night alone on the loose cable.

The next day, Parker begins to climb out of the lift, but the screw comes loose and causes the lift to fall. Blocked by a cable, the lift is hanging a few meters above the ground. Parker jumps and then the lift lands on her ankle. Injured, she begins to slide and crawl down the mountain. She encounters the wolves feasting on Joe's mutilated corpse. Too occupied with Joe's corpse, they ignore her as she continues down, eventually crawling to a nearby road.

The first car that passes doesn't see her but soon a minivan appears and the driver, seeing her outstretched body lying in the snow along the side of the road, stops to assist her. The film ends with the driver saying they are going to a nearby hospital, followed by Parker closing her eyes.

'''German art''' has a long and distinguished tradition in the [[visual arts]], from the earliest known work of figurative art to its current output of [[contemporary art]].

Germany has only been united into a single state since the 19th century, and defining its borders has been a notoriously difficult and painful process. For earlier periods German art often effectively includes that produced in German-speaking regions including [[Austria]], [[Alsace]] and much of [[Switzerland]], as well as [[History of German settlement in Central and Eastern Europe|largely German-speaking cities or regions to the east]] of the modern German borders.

Although tending to be neglected relative to Italian and French contributions from the point of view of the [[English-speaking world]], German art has played a crucial role in the development of [[Western art]], especially [[Celtic art]], [[Carolingian art]] and [[Ottonian art]].  From the development of [[Romanesque art]], France and Italy began to lead developments for the rest of the [[Middle Ages]], but the production of an increasingly wealthy Germany remained highly important.  The [[German Renaissance]] developed in rather different directions to the [[Italian Renaissance]], and was initially dominated by the central figure of [[Albrecht Dürer]] and the early German domination of printing.  The final phase of the Renaissance, [[Northern Mannerism]], was centred around the edges of the German lands, in [[Flanders]] and the Imperial capital of [[Prague]], but, especially in architecture, the German [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] took up these imported styles with enthusiasm. The German origins of [[Romanticism]] did not lead to an equally central position in the visual arts, but German participation in the many broadly [[Modernist]] movements following the collapse of [[Academic art]] have been increasing important.  

==Prehistory to Late Antiquity==
[[File:Venus-of-Schelklingen.jpg|thumb|left|[[Venus of Hohle Fels]], 35,000 to 40,000 BP, the oldest known figurative work of art (true height {{convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on}}).]]
The area of modern [[Germany]] is rich in finds of [[prehistoric art]], including the [[Venus of Hohle Fels]]. This appears to be the oldest undisputed example of [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic|Upper Paleolithic art]] and [[figurative art|figurative]] sculpture of the human form in general, from over 35,000 years BP, which was only discovered in 2008;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/may/14/science/sci-venus14 Venus figurine sheds light on origins of art by early humans] [[Los Angeles Times]], May 14, 2009, accessed December 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; the better-known [[Venus of Willendorf]] (24–22,000 BP) comes from a little way over the Austrian border. The spectacular finds of [[Bronze Age Europe|Bronze Age]] [[golden hat]]s are centred on Germany, as was the "central" form of [[Urnfield culture]], and [[Hallstatt culture]]. In the [[Iron Age]] the "Celtic" [[La Tène culture]] centred on Western Germany and Eastern France, and Germany has produced many major finds of [[Celtic art]] like the elite burials at [[European Archaeological Park of Bliesbruck-Reinheim|Reinheim]] and [[Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave|Hochdorf]], and ''[[oppida]]'' towns like [[Glauberg]], [[Oppidum of Manching|Manching]] and [[Heuneburg]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

After lengthy wars, the [[Roman Empire]] settled its frontiers in [[Germania]] with the [[Limes Germanicus]] to include much of the south and west of modern Germany. The German provinces produced art in provincial versions of Roman styles, but centres there, as over the Rhine in France, were large-scale producers of fine [[Ancient Roman pottery]], exported all over the Empire. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Rheinzabern]] was one of the largest, which has been well-excavated and has a dedicated museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terra-sigillata-museum.de/ Terra Sigillata Museum Rheinzabern] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Romanized areas of the later Roman period fall under [[Migration Period art]], notable for metalwork, especially jewellry (the largest pieces apparently mainly worn by men). {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Middle Ages==
[[File:BambergApocalypseFolio025vAngelWithLittleBook.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Bamberg Apocalypse]], from the [[Ottonian art|Ottonian]] [[Reichenau School]], achieves monumentality in a small scale. 1000–1020.]]
German medieval art really begins with the [[Frankish Empire]] of [[Charlemagne]] (d. 814), the first state to rule the great majority of the modern territory of Germany, as well as France and much of Italy. [[Carolingian art]] was restricted to a relatively small number of objects produced for a circle around the court and a number of [[List of Imperial abbeys|Imperial abbeys]] they sponsored, but had a huge influence on later [[Medieval art]] across Europe. The most common type of object to survive is the [[illuminated manuscript]]; wall paintings were evidently common but, like the buildings that housed them, have nearly all vanished. The earlier centres of illumination were located in modern France, but later [[Metz]] in [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] and the [[Abbey of Saint Gall]] in modern [[Switzerland]] came to rival them. The [[Drogo Sacramentary]] and [[Folchard Psalter]] are among the manuscripts they produced.&lt;ref&gt;See Hinks throughout, Chapters 1 of Beckwith and 3–4 of Dodwell&lt;/ref&gt;

No Carolingian [[monumental sculpture]] survives, although perhaps the most important patronage of Charlemagne was his commissioning of a life-size gold figure of [[Christ]] on a [[crucifix]] for his [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]]; this is only known from literary references and was probably gold foil around a wooden base, probably modelled with a [[gesso]] layer, like the later and rather crumpled [[Golden Madonna of Essen]]. [[Early Christian art]] had not featured monumental sculptures of religious figures as opposed to rulers, as these were strongly associated by the [[Church Fathers]] with the cult idols of [[Ancient Roman religion]]. [[Byzantine art]] and modern [[Eastern Orthodox]] religious art have maintained the prohibition to the present day, but Western art was apparently decisively influenced by the example of Charlemagne to abandon it. Charlemagne's circle wished to revive the glories of classical style, which they mostly knew in its [[Late Antique]] form, and also to compete with [[Byzantine art]], in which they appear to have been helped by refugee artists from the convulsions of the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]]. As Charlemagne himself does not appear to have been very interested in visual art, his political rivalry with the [[Byzantine Empire]], supported by the [[Papacy]], may have contributed to the strong pro-image position expressed in the [[Libri Carolini]], which set out the position on images held with little variation by the Western Church for the rest of the [[Middle Ages]], and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 32 on the ''Libri Carolini''&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the next [[Ottonian dynasty]], whose core territory approximated more closely to modern Germany, Austria, and German-speaking Switzerland, [[Ottonian art]] was mainly a product of the large monasteries, especially [[Reichenau Island|Reichenau]] which was the leading Western artistic centre in the second half of the 10th century. The Reichenau style uses simplified and patterned shapes to create strongly expressive images, far from the classical aspirations of Carolingian art, and looking forward to the Romanesque. The wooden [[Gero Cross]] of 965–970 in [[Cologne Cathedral]] is both the oldest and the finest early medieval near life-size crucifix figure; art historians had been reluctant to credit the records giving its date until they were confirmed by [[dendrochronology]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;  As in the rest of Europe, metalwork was still the most prestigious form of art, in works like the jewelled [[Cross of Lothair]], made about 1000, probably in [[Cologne]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}
[[File:Maria laach teufel schriftrolle.jpg|thumb|[[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] carving from [[Maria Laach]] Abbey]]

[[Romanesque art]] was the first artistic movement to encompass the whole of [[Western Europe]], though with regional varieties. Germany was a central part of the movement, though [[Regional characteristics of Romanesque architecture|German Romanesque architecture]] made rather less use of sculpture than that of France. With increasing prosperity massive churches were built in cities all over Germany, no longer just those patronized by the Imperial circle.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; The French invented the [[Gothic art|Gothic style]], and Germany was slow to adopt it, but once it had done so Germans made it their own, and continued to use it long after the rest of Europe had abandoned it. According to [[Henri Focillon]], Gothic allowed German art "to define for the first time certain aspects of its native genius-a vigorous and emphatic conception of life and form, in which theatrical ostentation mingled with vehement emotional frankness."&lt;ref&gt;Focillon, 106&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Bamberg Horseman]] of the 1330s, in [[Bamberg Cathedral]], is the oldest large post-antique standing stone equestrian statue; more medieval princely [[tomb monument]]s have survived from Germany than France or England. Romanesque and Early Gothic churches had wall paintings in local versions of international styles, of which few artists' names are known.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ThreeFoolishVirginsMagdeburg.jpg|thumb|left|Three [[Parable of the Ten Virgins|Foolish Virgins]], [[Magdeburg Cathedral]], c. 1250.]]

The court of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], then based in [[Prague]], played an important part in forming the [[International Gothic]] style in the late 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 24-7, 37 &amp; passim, Snyder, Chapter II&lt;/ref&gt; The style was spread around the wealthy cities of Northern Germany by artists such [[Conrad von Soest]] in [[Westphalia]] and [[Meister Bertram]] in [[Hamburg]], and later [[Stefan Lochner]] in [[Cologne]]. Hamburg was one of the cities in the [[Hanseatic League]], then at the height of its prosperity, and Bertram was succeeded in the city by artists such as [[Master Francke]], the [[Master of the Malchin Altar]], [[Hans Bornemann]], [[Hinrik Funhof]] and [[Wilm Dedeke]] who survived into the Renaissance period. Hanseatic artists painted commissions for Baltic cities in [[Scandinavia]] and the modern [[Baltic states]] to the east. In the south, the [[Master of the Bamberg Altar]] is the first significant painter based in [[Nuremberg]], while the [[Master of Heiligenkreuz]] and then [[Michael Pacher]] worked in Austria. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Like that of Pacher, the workshop of [[Bernt Notke]], a painter from the Hanseatic city of [[Lübeck]], both painted [[altarpiece]]s or carved them in the increasingly elaborate painted and gilded style used as frameworks or alternatives for painted panels.  South German wood sculpture was important in developing new subjects that reflected the intensely emotional devotional life encouraged by movements in late medieval Catholicism such as [[German mysticism]].  These are often known in English as [[andachtsbilder]] (devotional images) and include the ''[[Pietà]]'', ''[[Pensive Christ]]'', ''[[Man of Sorrows]]'', ''[[Arma Christi]]'', ''[[Veil of Veronica]]'', the severed head of [[John the Baptist]], and the ''[[Virgin of Sorrows]]'', many of which would spread across Europe and remain popular until the Baroque and, in popular religious imagery, beyond. Indeed "Late Gothic Baroque" is a term sometimes used to describe hyper-decorated and emotional 15th-century art, above all in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 308&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Schongauer]], who worked in Alsace in the last part of the 15th century, was the culmination of late Gothic German painting, with a sophisticated and harmonious style, but he increasingly spent his time producing engravings, for which national and international channels of distribution had developed, so that his [[old master print|prints]] were known in Italy and other countries. His predecessors were the [[Master of the Playing Cards]] and [[Master E. S.]], both also from the Upper Rhine region.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Chapters IV (painters to 1425), VII (painters to 1500), XIV (printmakers), &amp; XV (sculpture).&lt;/ref&gt;  German conservatism is shown in the late use of gold backgrounds, still used by many artists well into the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Focillon, 178–181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance painting and prints==
[[File:HMF Duerer Gruenewald Harrich Heller-Altar DSC 6312.jpg|thumb|The Heller altar by [[Albrecht Dürer]]]]
The concept of the [[Northern Renaissance]] or [[German Renaissance]] is somewhat confused by the continuation of the use of elaborate Gothic ornament until well into the 16th century, even in works that are undoubtedly Renaissance in their treatment of the human figure and other respects. Classical ornament had little historical resonance in much of Germany, but in other respects Germany was very quick to follow developments, especially in adopting [[printing]] with [[movable type]], a German invention that remained almost a German monopoly for some decades, and was [[Global spread of the printing press|first brought to most of Europe]], including France and Italy, by Germans. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[Printmaking]] by [[woodcut]] and [[engraving]] (perhaps another German invention) was already more developed in Germany and the [[Low Countries]] than anywhere else, and the Germans took the lead in developing book illustrations, typically of a relatively low artistic standard, but seen all over Europe, with the woodblocks often being lent to printers of editions in other cities or languages. The greatest artist of the German Renaissance, [[Albrecht Dürer]], began his career as an apprentice to a leading workshop in Nuremberg, that of [[Michael Wolgemut]], who had largely abandoned his painting to exploit the new medium. Dürer worked on the most extravagantly illustrated book of the period, the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]], published by his godfather [[Anton Koberger]], Europe's largest printer-publisher at the time.&lt;ref name=Bartrum2002&gt;Bartrum (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; 

After completing his apprenticeship in 1490, Dürer travelled in Germany for four years, and Italy for a few months, before establishing his own workshop in Nuremberg. He rapidly became famous all over Europe for his energetic and balanced woodcuts and engravings, while also painting. Though retaining a distinctively German style, his work shows strong Italian influence, and is often taken to represent the start of the German Renaissance in visual art, which for the next forty years replaced the Netherlands and France as the area producing the greatest innovation in Northern European art. Dürer supported [[Martin Luther]] but continued to create [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]]s and other Catholic imagery, and paint portraits of leaders on both sides of the emerging split of the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref name=Bartrum2002/&gt; 
[[File:Mathis Gothart Grünewald 022.jpg|The Crucifixion of Jesus Christ|right|thumb|''The [[Crucifixion]]'', central panel of the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]] by [[Matthias Grünewald]].|left]]

Dürer died in 1528, before it was clear that the split of the Reformation had become permanent, but his pupils of the following generation were unable to avoid taking sides. Most leading German artists became Protestants, but this deprived them of painting most religious works, previously the mainstay of artists' revenue. [[Martin Luther]] had objected to much Catholic imagery, but not to imagery itself, and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], a close friend of Luther, had painted a number of "Lutheran altarpieces", mostly showing the [[Last Supper]], some with portraits of the leading Protestant divines as the [[Twelve Apostles]]. This phase of Lutheran art was over before 1550, probably under the more fiercely [[aniconic]] influence of [[Calvinism]], and religious works for public display virtually ceased to be produced in Protestant areas. Presumably largely because of this, the development of German art had virtually ceased by about 1550, but in the preceding decades German artists had been very fertile in developing alternative subjects to replace the gap in their order books. Cranach, apart from portraits, developed a format of thin vertical portraits of provocative nudes, given classical or Biblical titles.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Part III, Ch. XIX on Cranach, Luther etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lying somewhat outside these developments is [[Matthias Grünewald]], who left very few works, but whose masterpiece, his ''[[Isenheim Altarpiece]]'' (completed 1515), has been widely regarded as the greatest German Renaissance painting since it was restored to critical attention in the 19th century. It is an intensely emotional work that continues the German Gothic tradition of unrestrained gesture and expression, using Renaissance compositional principles, but all in that most Gothic of forms, the multi-winged [[triptych]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Ch. XVII&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer 007.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Albrecht Altdorfer]] (c.1480–1538), ''Danube landscape near Regensburg'' c. 1528, one of the earliest Western pure landscapes, from the [[Danube School]] in southern [[Germany]].]]

The [[Danube School]] is the name of a circle of artists of the first third of the 16th century in [[Bavaria]] and Austria, including [[Albrecht Altdorfer]], [[Wolf Huber]] and [[Augustin Hirschvogel]]. With Altdorfer in the lead, the school produced the first examples of independent [[landscape art]] in the West (nearly 1,000 years after China), in both paintings and prints.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 9 – this is the main subject of the whole book&lt;/ref&gt;  Their religious paintings had an [[expressionist]] style somewhat similar to Grünewald's. Dürer's pupils [[Hans Burgkmair]] and [[Hans Baldung Grien]] worked largely in prints, with Baldung developing the topical subject matter of [[witch]]es in a number of enigmatic prints.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Ch. XVII, Bartrum, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans Holbein the Elder]] and his brother Sigismund Holbein painted religious works in the late Gothic style. Hans the Elder was a pioneer and leader in the transformation of German art from the Gothic to the Renaissance style. His son, [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] was an important painter of portraits and a few religious works, working mainly in England and Switzerland. Holbein's well known series of small woodcuts on the ''[[Dance of Death]]'' relate to the works of the [[Little Masters]], a group of printmakers who specialized in very small and highly detailed engravings for bourgeois collectors, including many erotic subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Ch. XX on the Holbeins, Bartrum (1995), 221–237 on Holbein's prints, 99–129 on the Little Masters&lt;/ref&gt;

The outstanding achievements of the first half of the 16th century were followed by several decades with a remarkable absence of noteworthy German art, other than accomplished portraits that never rival the achievement of Holbein or Dürer. The next significant German artists worked in the rather artificial style of [[Northern Mannerism]], which they had to learn in Italy or Flanders. [[Hans von Aachen]] and the Netherlandish [[Bartholomeus Spranger]] were the leading painters at the Imperial courts in [[Vienna]] and Prague, and the productive Netherlandish [[Sadeler family]] of engravers spread out across Germany, among other counties.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, Levey&lt;/ref&gt; This style was continued for another generation by [[Bartholomeus Strobel]], an example of an essentially German artist born and working in [[Silesia]], in today's [[Poland]], until he emigrated to escape the [[Thirty Years War]] and become painter at the Polish court. [[Adam Elsheimer]], the most influential German artist in the 17th century, spent his whole mature career in Italy, where he began by working for another émigré [[Hans Rottenhammer]]. Both produced highly finished [[cabinet painting]]s, mostly on copper, with classical themes and landscape backgrounds. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Sculpture==
[[File:Steinhausen Kapitell-1.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Wessobrunner School|Wessobrunner]] [[stucco]] at [[Schussenried Abbey]]]]

In Catholic parts of South Germany the Gothic tradition of wood carving continued to flourish until the end of the 18th century, adapting to changes in style through the centuries. [[Veit Stoss]] (d. 1533), [[Tilman Riemenschneider]] (d.1531) and [[Peter Vischer the Elder]] (d. 1529) were Dürer's contemporaries, and their long careers covered the transition between the Gothic and Renaissance periods, although their ornament often remained Gothic even after their compositions began to reflect Renaissance principles.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 298–311&lt;/ref&gt;

Two and a half centuries later, [[Johann Joseph Christian]] and [[Ignaz Günther]] were leading masters in the late Baroque period, both dying in the late 1770s, barely a decade before the [[French Revolution]]. A vital element in the effect of German Baroque interiors was the work of the [[Wessobrunner School]], a later term for the [[stucco]]ists of the late 17th and 18th centuries. Another manifestation of German sculptural skill was in [[porcelain]]; the most famous modeller is [[Johann Joachim Kaendler]] of the [[Meissen porcelain|Meissen]] factory in Dresden, but the best work of [[Franz Anton Bustelli]] for the [[Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory]] in [[Munich]] is often considered the greatest achievement of 18th-century porcelain.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, 156&lt;/ref&gt;

==17th to 19th-century painting==

===Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassicism===
[[File:Johann Liss 006.jpg|thumb|left|''The Fall of [[Phaethon|Phaeton]]'' by [[Johann Liss]].]]
[[File:Christian Gottlieb Schick 003.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gottlieb Schick]], ''Frau von Cotta'', 1802]]

[[Baroque painting]] was slow to arrive in Germany, with very little before about 1650, but once established seems to have suited German taste well.  [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] periods saw German art producing mostly works derivative of developments elsewhere, though numbers of skilled artists in various genres were active.  The period remains little-known outside Germany, and though it "never made any claim to be among the great schools of painting", its neglect by non-German art history remains striking.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths &amp; Carey, 24 (quotation), and Scheyer, 9 (from 1960, but the point remains valid)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many distinguished foreign painters spent periods working in Germany for princes, among them [[Bernardo Bellotto]] in [[Dresden]] and elsewhere, and [[Gianbattista Tiepolo]], who spent three years painting the [[Würzburg Residence]] with [[Domenico Tiepolo|his son]]. Many German painters worked abroad, including [[Johann Liss]] who worked mainly in [[Venice]], [[Joachim von Sandrart]] and [[Ludolf Bakhuisen]], the leading marine artist of the final years of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]]. In the late 18th century the portraitist [[Heinrich Füger]] and his pupil [[Johann Peter Krafft]], whose best known works are three large murals in the [[Hofburg Imperial Palace|Hofburg]], had both moved to Vienna as students and stayed there.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 62–65&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neoclassicism]] appears rather earlier in Germany than in France, with [[Anton Raphael Mengs]] (1728–79), the Danish painter [[Asmus Jacob Carstens]] (1754–98), and the sculptor [[Gottfried Schadow]] (1764–1850).  Mengs was one of the most highly regarded artists of his day, working in Rome, Madrid and elsewhere, and finding an early [[Neoclassicism|Neo-Classical]] style that now seems rather effete, although his portraits are more effective.  Carstens' shorter career was turbulent and troubled, leaving a trail of unfinished works, but through pupils and friends such as [[Gottlieb Schick]], [[Joseph Anton Koch]] and [[Bonaventura Genelli]], more influential.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 49–59&lt;/ref&gt;  Koch was born in the mountains of the Austrian [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and became the leading Continental painter of [[landscape art|landscapes]], concentrating on mountain views, despite spending much of his career in Rome. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[Daniel Chodowiecki]] was born in [[Danzig]], and at least partly identified as Polish, although he only spoke German and French. His paintings and hundreds of prints, book illustrations and political cartoons are an invaluable visual record of the everyday life and the increasingly complex mentality of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] Germany, and its emerging [[Nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths &amp; Carey, 50–68, Novotny, 60–62&lt;/ref&gt;  The Swiss-born [[Anton Graff]] was a prolific portraitist in Dresden, who painted literary figures as well as the court. The [[Tischbein family]] dynasty were solid all-rounders who covered most of the 18th century between them, as did the [[Zick]] family, initially mainly painters of grand Baroque ceilings, who were still active in the 20th century in the person of the illustrator [[Alexander Zick]].&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 60&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[Asam brothers]], and [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]] and [[Dominikus Zimmermann|his brother]], were able between them to provide a complete service for commissions for churches and palaces, designing the building and executing the stucco and wall-paintings.  The combined effect of all the elements of these buildings in South Germany, Austria and [[Bohemia]], especially their interiors, represent some of the most complete and extreme realizations of the Baroque aspiration to overwhelm the viewer with the "radiant fairy world of the nobleman's dwelling", or the "foretaste of the glories of Paradise" in the case of churches.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 352–357; quotes from pp. 355 &amp; 357&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest German [[academy]] was the [[Akademie der Künste]] founded in [[Berlin]] in 1696, and through the next two centuries a number of other cities established their own institutions, in parallel with developments in other European nations. In Germany the uncertain market for art in a country divided into a multitude of small states meant that significant German artists have been to the present day more likely to accept teaching posts in the academies and their successor institutions than their equivalents in England or France have been. In general German academies imposed a particular style less rigidly than was for long the case in Paris,  London, Moscow or elsewhere. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Writing about art===
[[File:Caspar David Friedrich - Wanderer above the sea of fog.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Caspar David Friedrich]], ''[[Wanderer above the Sea of Fog]]'' (1818)]]

The Enlightenment period saw German writers becoming leading theorists and critics of art, led by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], who exalted [[Ancient Greek art]] and, despite never visiting Greece or actually seeing many Ancient Greek statues, set out an analysis distinguishing between the main periods of Ancient Greek art, and relating them to wider historical movements.  Winckelmann's work marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture; he was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. Goethe had tried to train as an artist, and his landscape sketches show "occasional flashes of emotion in the presence of nature which are quite isolated in the period".&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 78 (quotation); and see index for Winckelmann etc.&lt;/ref&gt;  The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''.  In the following century, German universities were the first to teach art history as an academic subject, beginning the leading position that Germany (and Austria) was to occupy in the study of [[art history]] until the dispersal of scholars abroad in the Nazi period.  [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] championed what he identified in the Gothic and Dürer as specifically Germanic styles, beginning an argument over the proper models for a German artist against the so-called "Tyranny of Greece over Germany" that would last nearly two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;The rhetorical phrase was coined, or popularized, by: [[E. M. Butler|Butler, Eliza M.]], "The Tyranny of Greece over Germany: a study of the influence exercised by Greek art and poetry over the great German writers of the
eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries" (Cambridge Univ. Press, London, 1935)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romanticism and the Nazarenes===
[[German Romanticism]] saw a revival of innovation and distinctiveness in German art. Outside Germany only [[Caspar David Friedrich]] is well-known, but there were a number of artists with very individual styles, notably [[Philipp Otto Runge]], who like Friedrich had trained at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Copenhagen Academy]] and was forgotten after his death until a revival in the 20th century.  Friedrich painted almost entirely landscapes, with a distinctive Northern feel, and always a feeling of quasi-religious stillness.  Often his figures are seen from behind – they like the viewer are lost in contemplation of the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 95–101&lt;/ref&gt;  Runge's portraits, mostly of his own circle, are naturalistic except for his huge-faced children, but the other works in his brief career increasingly reflected a visionary [[pantheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 106–112&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Adrian Ludwig Richter]] is mainly remembered for his portraits, and [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Carl_Wilhelm_Kolbe_d._%C3%84. Carl Wilhelm Kolbe] was purely an [[etcher]] (as well as a [[philologist]]), whose later prints show figures almost swallowed up by gigantic vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths and Carey, 112–122&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Friedrich Overbeck 008.jpg|thumb|left|[[Johann Friedrich Overbeck]] of the [[Nazarene movement]], ''Italia und Germania''.]]

The [[Nazarene movement]], the coinage of a mocking critic, denotes a group of early 19th-century German Romantic painters who aimed to revive honesty and spirituality in Christian art. The principal motivation of the Nazarenes was a reaction against Neoclassicism and the routine art education of the academy system. They hoped to return to art which embodied spiritual values, and sought inspiration in artists of the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, rejecting what they saw as the superficial virtuosity of later art. Their programme was not dissimilar to that of the English [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in the 1850s, although the core group took it as far as wearing special pseudo-medieval clothing.  In 1810 [[Johann Friedrich Overbeck]], [[Franz Pforr]], [[Ludwig Vogel]] and the Swiss Johann Konrad Hottinger moved to [[Rome]], where they occupied the abandoned monastery of San Isidoro. They were joined by [[Philipp Veit]], [[Peter von Cornelius]], [[Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow]] and a loose grouping of other German artists. They met up with the Austrian romantic landscape artist Joseph Anton Koch, (1768–1839) who became an unofficial tutor to the group. In 1827 they were joined by [[Joseph von Führich]], and [[Eberhard Wächter (painter)|Eberhard Wächter]] was later associated with the group.  Unlike the strong support given to the Pre-Raphaelites by the dominant art critic of the day, [[John Ruskin]], Goethe was dismissive of the Nazarenes: "This the first case in the history of art when real talents have taken the fancy to form themselves backwards by retreating into their mother's womb, and thus found a new epoch in art."&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths &amp; Carey, 24–25 and ''passim'', quotation from p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by the Nazarene Schadow, son of the sculptor, the [[Düsseldorf school]] was a group of artists who painted mostly landscapes, and who studied at, or were influenced by the [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf|Düsseldorf Academy]], founded in 1767. The academy's influence grew in the 1830s and 1840s, and it had many American students, several of whom became associated with the [[Hudson River School]].&lt;ref&gt;John K. Howat: American Paradise: The World of the Hudson River School, S. 311&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ritratto della famiglia Begas.jpg|thumb|The family of the painter [[Carl Begas]], 1808, celebrating domesticity in [[Biedermeier]] style]]

===Naturalism and beyond===
[[Biedermeier]] refers to a style in literature, music, the visual arts and interior design in the period between the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815 and the revolutions of 1848.  Biedermeier art appealed to the prosperous middle classes by detailed but polished [[realism (arts)|realism]], often celebrating domestic virtues, and came to dominate over French-leaning aristocratic tastes, as well as the yearnings of Romanticism. [[Carl Spitzweg]] was a leading German artist in the style.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Margaret, in ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760–1850, Volume 1'',

[[File:Suende Franz Stuck ohne Rahmen.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Franz Stuck]] (1873) ''Sünde'' (''Sin'')]]

In the second half of the 19th century a number of styles developed, paralleling trends in other European counties, though the lack of a dominant capital city probably contributed to even more diversity of styles than in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 180&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolph Menzel]] enjoyed enormous popularity both among the German public and officialdom; at his funeral [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor]] walked behind his coffin. He dramaticised past and contemporary [[Prussia]]n military successes both in paintings and brilliant [[wood engraving]]s illustrating books, yet his domestic subjects are intimate and touching. He followed the development of early [[Impressionism]] to create a style that he used for depicting grand public occasions, among other subjects like his ''[[Studio Wall]]''. [[Karl von Piloty]] was a leading [[academic art|academic]] painter of history subjects in the latter part of the century who taught [[Academy of Fine Arts Munich|in Munich]]; among his more famous pupils were [[Hans Makart]], [[Franz von Lenbach]], [[Franz Defregger]], [[Gabriel von Max]] and [[Eduard von Grützner]]. The term "Munich school" is used both of German [[Munich School|and of Greek painting]], after Greeks like [[Georgios Jakobides]] studied under him. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The [[Berlin Secession]] was a group founded in 1898 by painters including [[Max Liebermann]], who broadly shared the artistic approach of [[Manet]] and the French [[Impressionist]]s, and [[Lovis Corinth]] then still painting in a naturalistic style.  The group survived until the 1930s, despite splits, and its regular exhibitions helped launch the next two generations of Berlin artists, without imposing a particular style.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 181–184, and see index for later mentions&lt;/ref&gt;  Near the end of the century, the [[Benedictine]] [[Beuron Art School]] developed a style, mostly for religious murals, in rather muted colours, with a [[medievalist]] interest in pattern that drew from [[Les Nabis]] and in some ways looked forward to [[Art Nouveau]] or the Jugendstil ("Youth Style") as it is known in German.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 113&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franz von Stuck]] and [[Max Klinger]] are the leading German [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] painters. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==20th century==
[[File:Franz Marc 020.jpg|thumb|''Rehe im Walde'' ("[[Roe deer]] in the forest") by [[Franz Marc]]]]
Even more than in other countries, German art in the early 20th century developed through a number of loose groups and movements, many covering other artistic media as well, and often with a specific political element, as with the [[Arbeitsrat für Kunst]] and [[November Group (German)|November Group]], both formed in 1918. In 1922 The November Group, the Dresden Secession, Das Junge Rheinland, and several other progressive groups formed a "Cartel of advanced artistic groups in Germany" (Kartell fortschrittlicher Künstlergruppen in Deutschland) in an effort to gain exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Crockett, Dennis (1999). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EQzdp1zN--oC&amp;pg=PA76 German Post-Expressionism : The Art of the Great Disorder 1918–1924]''. University Park, Pa: Pennsylvania State University Press. p. 76. {{ISBN|0271043164}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Die Brücke]] ("The Bridge") was one of two groups of German painters fundamental to [[German expressionism|expressionism]], the other being [[Der Blaue Reiter]] group. Die Brücke was a group of German expressionist artists formed in [[Dresden]] in 1905 by architecture students who wanted to be painters: [[Fritz Bleyl]] (1880–1966), [[Erich Heckel]] (1883–1970), [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] (1880–1938) and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]] (1884–1976), with [[Max Pechstein]] and others later joining.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 197–204, and Honour &amp; Fleming, 569–576&lt;/ref&gt; The notoriously individualistic [[Emil Nolde]] (1867–1956) was briefly a member of Die Brücke, but was at odds with the younger members of the group.&lt;!-- will expand --&gt; Die Brücke moved to Berlin in 1911, where it eventually dissolved in 1913. Perhaps their most important contribution had been the rediscovery of the [[woodcut]] as a valid medium for original artistic expression. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[Der Blaue Reiter]] ("The Blue Rider") formed in [[Munich]], Germany in 1911. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], [[Marianne von Werefkin]] and others founded the group in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting Last Judgment from an exhibition by Neue Künstlervereinigung—another artists' group of which Kandinsky had been a member. The name Der Blaue Reiter derived from Marc's enthusiasm for horses, and from Kandinsky's love of the colour blue. For Kandinsky, blue is the colour of spirituality—the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal (see his 1911 book On the Spiritual in Art). Kandinsky had also titled a painting Der Blaue Reiter (see illustration) in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 569–576, and Hamilton, 215–221&lt;/ref&gt; The intense sculpture and printmaking of [[Käthe Kollwitz]] was strongly influenced by [[Expressionism]], which also formed the starting point for the young artists who went on to join other tendencies within the movements of the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 189–191&lt;/ref&gt;

''Die Brücke'' and ''Der Blaue Reiter'' were both examples of tendency of early 20th-century German art to be "honest, direct, and spiritually engaged"&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Jacobus, and Wheeler (2000) p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in how the two groups attempted this were telling, however. The artists of Der Blaue Reiter were less oriented towards intense expression of emotion and more towards theory- a tendency which would lead Kandinsky to pure abstraction. Still, it was the spiritual and symbolic properties of abstract form that were important. There were therefore Utopian tones to Kandinsky's abstractions: "We have before us an age of conscious creation, and this new spirit in painting is going hand in hand with thoughts toward an epoch of greater spirituality."&lt;ref&gt;qtd. Hunter et al p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; ''Die Brücke'' also had Utopian tendencies, but took the medieval craft guild as a model of cooperative work that could better society- "Everyone who with directness and authenticity conveys that which drives him to creation belongs to us".&lt;ref&gt;From the Manifesto of Die Brücke, qtd Hunter et al p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bauhaus]] also shared these Utopian leanings, seeking to combine fine and applied arts ([[Gesamtkunstwerk]]) with a view towards creating a better society. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Weimar period===

A major feature of German art in the early 20th century until 1933 was a boom in the production of works of art of a [[grotesque]] style.&lt;ref&gt;[[Esti Sheinberg]] (2000) ''Irony, Satire, Parody and the Grotesque in the Music of Dmitrii Shostakovich'', pp.248–9, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-0226-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pamela Kort]] (2004) ''Comic Grotesque'', Prestel Publishing {{ISBN|978-3-7913-3195-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists using the [[Satirical]]-[[Grotesque]] genre included [[George Grosz]], [[Otto Dix]] and [[Max Beckmann]], at least in their works of the 1920s. [[Dada]] in Germany, the leading practitioners of which were [[Kurt Schwitters]] and [[Hannah Höch]], was centered in Berlin, where it tended to be more politically oriented than Dada groups elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Hunter et all on Dada"&gt;Hunter, Jacobus, and Wheeler (2000) pp. 173–77&lt;/ref&gt; They made important contributions to the development of collage as a medium for political commentary- Schwitters later developed his ''Merzbau'', a forerunner of installation art.&lt;ref name="Hunter et all on Dada" /&gt; Dix and Grosz were also associated with the Berlin Dada group. [[Max Ernst]] led a [[Dada]] group in Cologne, where he also practiced collage, but with a greater interest in Gothic fantasy than in overt political content&amp;mdash;this hastened his transition into [[surrealism]], of which he became the leading German practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 473–478&lt;/ref&gt;  The Swiss-born [[Paul Klee]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and others experimented with [[cubism]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The [[New Objectivity]], or Neue Sachlichkeit (new matter-of-factness), was an art movement which arose in Germany during the 1920s as an outgrowth of, and in opposition to, expressionism. It is thus post-expressionist and applied to works of visual art as well as literature, music, and architecture. It describes the stripped-down, simplified building style of the [[Bauhaus]] and the [[Weissenhof Settlement]], the urban planning and public housing projects of [[Bruno Taut]] and [[Ernst May]], and the industrialization of the household typified by the [[Frankfurt kitchen]]. Grosz and Dix were leading figures, forming the "Verist" side of the movement with Beckmann and [[Christian Schad]], [[Rudolf Schlichter]], [[Georg Scholz]] (in his early work), [[Elfriede Lohse-Wächtler]], and [[Karl Hubbuch]]. The other tendency is sometimes called [[Magic Realism]], and included [[Anton Räderscheidt]], [[Georg Schrimpf]], [[Alexander Kanoldt]], and [[Carl Grossberg]]. Unlike some of the other groupings, the Neue Sachlichkeit was never a formal group, and its artists were associated with other groups; the term was invented by a sympathetic curator, and "Magic Realism" by an art critic.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 478–479&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plakatstil]], "poster style" in German, was an early style of [[poster]] design that began in the early 20th century, using bold, straight fonts with very simple designs, in contrast to [[Art Nouveau]] posters. [[Lucian Bernhard]] was a leading figure. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Art in the Third Reich===
[[File:Made in Germany by George Grosz 1920.jpg|thumb|''Made in Germany'' ({{lang-de|Den macht uns keiner nach}}), by [[George Grosz]], drawn in pen 1919, photo-lithograph 1920.]]
{{Main|Nazi art}}

The Nazi regime banned [[modern art]], which they condemned as [[degenerate art]] (from the German: entartete Kunst). According to Nazi ideology, modern art deviated from the prescribed norm of [[classical beauty]]. While the 1920s to 1940s are considered the heyday of modern art movements, there were conflicting nationalistic movements that resented abstract art, and Germany was no exception. Avant-garde German artists were now branded both enemies of the state and a threat to the German nation.  Many went into exile, with relatively few returning after World War II.  Dix was one who remained, being conscripted into the [[Volkssturm]] Home Guard militia; Pechstein kept his head down in rural [[Pomerania]]. Nolde also stayed, creating his "unpainted pictures" in secret after being forbidden to paint. Beckmann, Ernst, Grosz, Feininger and others went to America, Klee to Switzerland, where he died. Kirchner committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ernst Ludwig Kirchner Biography, Art, and Analysis of Works|url = http://www.theartstory.org/artist-kirchner-ernst-ludwig.htm|accessdate = 2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, 1937, the Nazis mounted a polemical exhibition entitled ''Entartete Kunst'' ([[Degenerate art]]), in Munich; it subsequently travelled to eleven other cities in Germany and Austria. The show was intended as an official condemnation of modern art, and included over 650 paintings, sculptures, prints, and books from the collections of thirty two German museums. Expressionism, which had its origins in Germany, had the largest proportion of paintings represented. Simultaneously, and with much pageantry, the Nazis presented the ''Grosse deutsche Kunstausstellung'' (Great German art exhibition) at the palatial ''Haus der deutschen Kunst'' (House of German Art). This exhibition displayed the work of officially approved artists such as [[Arno Breker]] and [[Adolf Wissel]]. At the end of four months ''Entartete Kunst'' had attracted over two million visitors, nearly three and a half times the number that visited the nearby ''Grosse deutsche Kunstausstellung''.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 486–487&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Performance art]]ist, sculptor, and theorist [[Joseph Beuys]] was perhaps the most influential German artist of the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/306 Moma Focus], retrieved 16 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; His main contribution to theory was the expansion of the [[Gesamtkunstwerk]] to include the whole of society, as expressed by his famous expression "Everyone is an artist". This expanded concept of art, known as [[social sculpture]], defines everything that contributes creatively to society as artistic in nature. The form this took in his oeuvre  varied from richly metaphoric, almost shamanistic performances based on his personal mythology (''[[Joseph Beuys#.22How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare.22 .28performance.2C 1965.29|How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare]]'', ''[[Joseph Beuys#.22I Like America and America Likes Me.22 .28performance.2C 1974.29|I Like America and America Likes Me]]'') to more direct and utilitarian expressions, such as [[7000 Oaks]] and his activities in the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green party]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The '''golden apple''' is an element that appears in various national and ethnic [[folk legends]] or [[fairy tales]]. Recurring themes depict a hero (for example [[Hercules]] or [[Făt-Frumos]]) retrieving the golden [[apple (symbolism)|apple]]s hidden or stolen by a monstrous [[antagonist]]. Alternatively, they are depicted as divine food and the source of [[immortality]] in [[Norse mythology]], and as part of the mysterious [[Silver Branch|apple branch]] of [[Celtic Otherworld|Otherworld]] in [[Irish mythology]].

== Greek mythology ==
Three instances of golden apples were featured in [[Greek mythology]]:

===Atalanta===
{{Main article|Atalanta}}
[[Image:Guido Reni - Atalanta e Ippomene (Napoli).jpg|thumb|left|340px|''Atalanta and Melanion'', [[Guido Reni]], c. 1622&amp;ndash;25]]

The first case concerns a huntress named Atalanta who raced against a suitor named [[Melanion]].  Melanion used golden apples to distract Atalanta so that he could win the race.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though abandoned by her father as an infant, Atalanta became a skilled hunter and received acclaim for her role in the hunt for the Calydonian boar.  Her father claimed her as his daughter and wished to marry her off.  However, Atalanta was reluctant to marry due to a prophecy that marriage would be her downfall.  Because of her beauty, she gained a number of suitors and finally agreed to marry, but under the condition that her suitor was obligated to beat her in a footrace.  Competitors who failed to beat her would be put to death.  As Atalanta could run extremely fast, all her suitors died.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Realizing that Atalanta could not be defeated in a fair race, Melanion prayed to [[Aphrodite]] for help.  The goddess gave him three golden apples and told him to drop them one at a time to distract Atalanta.  Sure enough, she quit running long enough to retrieve each golden apple.  It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Melanion finally succeeded, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eventually they had a son [[Parthenopeus|Parthenopaios]], who was one of the Seven against Thebes.  Their marriage ended in misfortune when they were transformed into lions (which the Greeks believed were unable to mate with their own species, only with leopards) for offending the gods.

===Golden Apple of Trojan War Fable===
{{Main article|Judgement of Paris|Apple of Discord}}
[[File:Enrique Simonet - El Juicio de Paris - 1904.jpg|thumb|left|390px|[[El Juicio de Paris (Simonet)|''El Juicio de Paris'']] by [[Enrique Simonet]], 1904. [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] is holding the golden apple on his right hand while surveying the goddesses in a calculative manner.]]

[[Zeus]] held a [[banquet]] in celebration of the marriage of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]]. [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], the goddess of discord, was not invited for her troublesome nature, and upon turning up uninvited, she threw a golden apple into the ceremony, with an inscription that read:  "ΤΗΙ ΚΑΛΛΙΣΤΗΙ" ({{lang-grc|τῇ καλλίστῃ|translit=tē(i) kallistē(i)}}, [[Greek language|Modern Greek]]: τη καλλίστη ''ti kallisti''; "for/to the most beautiful" – cf. [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]). Three goddesses claimed the apple: [[Hera]], [[Athena]], and [[Aphrodite]]. They brought the matter before Zeus. Not wanting to get involved, Zeus assigned the task to [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] of Troy. Paris had demonstrated his exemplary fairness previously when he awarded a prize unhesitatingly to [[Ares]] after the god, in bull form, had bested his own prize bull.

Zeus gave the apple to [[Hermes]] and told him to deliver it to Paris and tell him that the goddesses would accept his decision without argument. As each goddess wanted to receive the apple, they each stripped off their own clothing and appeared naked before [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]. Each of the goddesses also offered Paris a gift as a bribe in return for the apple; Hera offered to make him the king of Europe and Asia Minor, Athena offered him wisdom and skill in battle, and Aphrodite offered to give to him the love of the world's most beautiful woman, [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] of Sparta, who was already married to King Menelaus. Paris chose Aphrodite, a decision that caused the [[Trojan war]], and ultimately the destruction of both Paris and his city, Troy.

==Norse mythology==
[[Image:Ring5.jpg|right|thumb|[[Freia]], from ''[[Das Rheingold]]'', with the tree of golden apples]]
In [[Norse mythology]], the golden apples are the source of the gods' immortality and perpetual youth; comparable to the role of [[ambrosia]] in [[Greek mythology]]. They are cultivated by—and most often associated with—the goddess [[Iðunn]].

===In myth===
In the book ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', Iðunn is mentioned in its first chapter (numbered as 55) as one of eight [[Æsir|ásynjur]] (goddesses) sitting in their thrones at a banquet in [[Asgard]] for [[Ægir]].&lt;ref name=FAULKES59&gt;Faulkes (1995:59).&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 56, [[Bragi]] tells Ægir about Iðunn's abduction by the [[jötunn]] [[Þjazi]]. Bragi says that after hitting an eagle (Þjazi in disguise) with a pole, [[Loki]] finds himself stuck to the bird, and being pulled further and further into the sky, his feet banging against stones, gravel, and trees, and he felt his arms might be pulled out from his shoulders. Loki shouted and begged the eagle for a truce, and the eagle responds that Loki would only be freed if he made a solemn vow to have Iðunn come outside of Asgard with her apples. Loki accepts and returns to his friends [[Odin]] and [[Hœnir]]. At the time the Þjazi and Loki agreed on, Loki lures Iðunn out of Asgard into "a certain forest", telling her that he had discovered some apples that she would find worth keeping, and told Iðunn that she ought to bring her apples with her so that she may compare them with the apples Loki discovered. Þjazi arrives in eagle shape, snatches Iðunn, flies away with her, and takes her to his home, [[Þrymheimr]].&lt;ref name=FAULKES60&gt;Faulkes (1995:60).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Æsir begin to grow grey and old at the disappearance of Iðunn. The Æsir hold an assembly [[thing (assembly)|thing]], where they ask one another when Iðunn had been seen last. The Æsir realize that the last time that Iðunn was seen was when she was going outside of Asgard with Loki, and so they have Loki arrested and brought to the assembly, where he is threatened with death and torture. Terrified, Loki says that he will search for Iðunn in the land of [[Jötunheimr]] if the goddess [[Freyja]] will lend him her "[[falcon]] shape". Freyja lends the falcon shape to Loki, and with it he flies north to Jötunheimr, and arrives a day later at Þjazi's home. Loki finds that Þjazi is out in a boat at sea, and that Iðunn is home alone. Loki turns her into a [[nut (fruit)|nut]], holds her in his claws, and flies away with her as fast as possible.&lt;ref name=FAULKES60/&gt;

Upon Þjazi's arrival home, he finds that Iðunn is gone. Þjazi assumes his eagle shape, and chases after Loki, causing a storm wind. The Æsir see a falcon flying with a nut, as well as the pursuing eagle, so they go outside from Asgard, with loads of wood shavings. The falcon flies over the fortification, and drops down by the wall. The eagle is unable to stop when he misses the falcon, the feathers of the eagle catch fire, and he falls. The Æsir, close by, kill the jötunn Þjazi within the gates of Asgard, "and this killing is greatly renowned."&lt;ref name=FAULKES60/&gt;

==Irish mythology==
The role of the Golden Apple is far more minor and less specific in [[Irish mythology|Irish lore]], mostly because it is an element of the [[Silver Branch]], or ''Silver Bough'', symbol that is connected to the [[Celtic Otherworld]].

===Apple branch===
Described in [[The Voyage of Bran]] as "a silver branch of the sacred apple-tree bearing blossoms",&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Eleanor Hull, The Silver Bough in Irish Legend, in Folk-Lore, xii.&lt;/ref&gt; it is said that "to enter the Otherworld before the appointed hour marked by death, a passport was often necessary, and this was usually a silver branch,"&lt;ref&gt;Extract from Gods of the Celts, published by Dalriada Publications – http://www.manannan.net/library/godofthecelts.html&lt;/ref&gt; thus continuing the apple's divine connection found in Greek and Norse myth.&lt;ref name="MacKillop1"&gt;James MacKillop, ''Dictionary of Celtic Mythology'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1998, pp.21, 205, 270, 322–3, 346, 359–60. {{ISBN|0-19-280120-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This connection is particularly strong regarding the Irish [[water deity|sea deity]] and Otherworld guardian [[Manannán mac Lir]], as evidenced in the tale [[His Three Calls to Cormac]]. In this story Manannán gifts a "branch of silver with three golden apples" to King [[Cormac mac Airt]] and, when shaken, these golden apples produced a music that could put anybody to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;This tale exists in several manuscripts of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; i. e. Book of Ballymote, and Yellow Book of Lecan, as edited and translated by Stokes, in Irische Texts, III. i. 183–229; cf. Voy. of Bran, i. 190 ff.; cf. Le Cycle Myth. Irl., pp. 326–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Part I Book IV: His Three Calls to Cormac – http://www.manannan.net/library/Lady%20Gregory/His%20Three%20Calls%20to%20Cormac.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gregory1"&gt;Gregory, Lady Augusta (1903) [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/gafm/gafm21.htm online "Part I Book IV: His Three Calls to Cormac"] in ''Gods and Fighting Men''. Buckinghamshire, Colyn Smyth&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Joseph. "The Fate of the Children of Lir." More Celtic Fairy Tales. Illustrated by John D. Batten. London: David Nutt, 1894. 204–209. – http://www.luminarium.org/mythology/ireland/cormacfairy.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gods and Fighting Men – The Story of the Tuatha De Danaan and of the Fianna of Ireland, arranged and put into English by  Lady Gregory with a preface by W.B. Yeats (1905) – Chapter XI. His Three Calls to Cormac – https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14465/14465-h/14465-h.htm#L22&lt;/ref&gt; This gift however, was conditional in that the price was the King's family and, though they are eventually restored to him, Manannán used to silver branch of golden apples as the means to teach Cormac a harsh lesson. In addition, in her ''[[Gods and Fighting Men]]'' (1904),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gods and Fighting Men, Lady Gregory |year=1904 |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/gafm/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augusta, Lady Gregory]] describes Manannán's gift as a "shining branch having nine apples of red gold."&lt;ref name="Gregory1"/&gt;

==Music==
In [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', the golden apples have their own [[leitmotif]]. It is first sung by [[Fafnir|Fafner]], when he explains to his brother Fasolt why they must take Freia away from the gods.

In [[Stravinsky]]'s ballet [[The Firebird]] (1910) which is based upon an amalgam of Russian folk-legends, the hero Prince Ivan enters a garden where he witnesses 13 young Princesses' playing with Golden Apples which grow there. (Tableaux VII Scherzo. Jeux des princesses avec les pommes d'or / The Princesses' Game with the Golden Apples).

==Fairy tales==
[[Image:Firebird.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ivan Tsarevich]] catches the [[Firebird (Slavic folklore)|Firebird]] who tries to steal golden apples in ''[[Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf]]'']]
Many European fairy tales begin when golden apples are stolen from a king, usually by a bird:
*"[[Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf]]" (Russian)
*"[[The Golden Bird]]" (German)
*"[[The Golden Mermaid]]" (German)
*"[[The Nine Peahens and the Golden Apples]]" (Serbian/Bulgarian)
*"[[Prâslea the Brave and the Golden Apples]]" (Romanian, where the thief is not a bird but a [[zmeu]])
*"[[The Three Brothers and the Golden Apple]]" (Bulgarian, where the thief is not a bird but a [[zmey]])
*"[[The White Snake]]" (German)

==Modern literature==
The [[William Butler Yeats]] poem "The Song of the Wandering Aengus", has the lines:
:''I will find out where she has gone''
:''And kiss her lips and take her hands;''
:''And walk among long dappled grass,''
:''And pluck till time and times are done''
:''The silver apples of the moon,''
:''The golden apples of the sun.''

The [[Augusta, Lady Gregory]] play called ''The Golden Apple: A Play for Kiltartan Children'' is a fable in the invented [[Kiltartan]] dialect based on Irish mythology and folklore.

''The Golden Apples'' is the name of Southern writer, Eudora Welty's, fourth short story collection, published in 1949. The stories are interrelated and center around the citizens of the fictional town of Morgana, Mississippi.

A golden apple plays a crucial role in the climax of [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell's]] sixth novel ''[[The Bone Clocks]]'', published by Random House in 2014.

==Discordianism==
The contemporary religion [[Discordianism]] draws upon the Golden Apple of the goddess [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], also known as the "Apple of Discord", which Eris used to set off the conflict among the goddesses of Olympus that lead to the [[Trojan War]] because she was not invited to a party (the so-called "Original Snub". Emblazoned upon the apple is the word "''[[Kallisti]]''" ("to the fairest").&lt;ref name="principiadiscordia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/24.php |title=Page 17-18 |publisher=Principia Discordia |date= |accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The golden apple can be seen as a metaphor for a practical joke meant to cause [[cognitive dissonance]] in the target.

==Identity and use in other languages==

===Argan fruit===
Michael Hübner has suggested that the fruit of the [[Argania|Argan tree]], endemic to the [[Sous Valley]] in present-day [[Morocco]], may be the golden apples of the [[Hesperides (poetry)|Hesperides]]. Arguing that the location matches most closely the description given in classical texts of [[Atlantis]] and the garden of the Hesperides, he notes that the ripe fruits look like small golden apples and have an aroma like baked apples. He equates the fruit, the seeds of which produce [[Argan oil]], with [[Plato]]'s account of Atlantean fruits "which afford liquid and solid food and unguents", and proposes that the trees' almost reptilian-scale like bark and thorns may have inspired the mythical guardian dragon of the golden apples, [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Hübner|title=Circumstantial Evidence for Plato's Island Atlantis in the Souss-Massa plain in today's South-Morocco|url=http://asalas.org/papers/Huebner_Atlantis_Circumstantial_Evidence_full.pdf|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oranges===
In many languages, the [[orange (fruit)|orange]] is referred to as a "golden apple". For example, the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''χρυσομηλιά,'' and [[Latin]] ''pomum aurantium'' both literally describe oranges as "golden apples". Other languages, like [[German language|German]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and [[Russian language|Russian]], have more complex [[etymologies]] for the word "orange" that can be traced back to the same idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/Citr_sin.html#etym ''Orange (Citrus sinensis [L.&amp;#93; Osbeck) Etymology''], Gernot Katzer, [http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/index.html Gernot Katzer Spice Pages], formerly [[University of Graz]], February 3, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years it was thought that the "golden apples" of myth might have actually been [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], a fruit unknown to [[Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean]] before the [[Middle Ages]]. Under this assumption, the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[botanical]] name chosen for all [[citrus]] species was ''Hesperidoeidē'' (Ἑσπεριδοειδῆ, "hesperidoids"). It was also used by [[Carl Linnaeus]], who gave the name Hesperides to an [[order (biology)|order]] containing the [[genus]] Citrus, in allusion to the golden apples of the Hesperides, and is preserved in the term [[Hesperidium]] for the fruits of citrus and some other plants.

One reason why oranges might be considered to be "magical" in so many stories is because they bear flowers and fruit at the same time, unlike other fruit.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Quinces===
Frequently, the term "golden apple" is used to refer to the [[quince]], a fruit originating in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.saucemagazine.com/a/890 |title=Quince, the 'Golden Apple'| author=Arnot, Sharon | work= Sauce Magazine|date=April 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomatoes===
The [[tomato]], unknown to the ancient world of the Greeks, is known as the ''pomodoro'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], meaning "golden apple" (from ''pomo d'oro'').{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Popular Culture==
Golden apples are also items that are featured in video games such as *[[Minecraft]]&lt;ref&gt;https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Golden_Apple&lt;/ref&gt; and *[[Hello Neighbor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://helloneighbor.gamepedia.com/Apple|website=helloneighbor.gamepedia.com|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Ossawa Tanner''' (June 21, 1859 &amp;ndash; May 25, 1937) was an American artist and the first [[African-American art|African-American painter]] to gain international acclaim.&lt;ref name =WhiteHouse&gt;{{cite web | url=http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/EOP/First_Lady/html/hot-bio.html | title=Henry Ossawa Tanner | accessdate=August 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanner moved to [[Paris]], France, in 1891 to study, and continued to live there after being accepted in French artistic circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Henry Ossawa Tanner: American Artist|author=Marcia M. Mathews|year= 1995|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-51006-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His painting entitled ''Daniel in the Lions' Den'' was accepted into the 1896 [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]],&lt;ref name="Matthews, Marcia"/&gt; the official [[art exhibition]] of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris.

After his own self-study in art as a young man, Tanner enrolled in 1879 at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in Philadelphia. The only black student, he became a favorite of the painter [[Thomas Eakins]], who had recently begun teaching there. Tanner made other connections among artists, including [[Robert Henri]]. In the late 1890s he was sponsored for a trip to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] by [[Rodman Wanamaker]], who was impressed by his paintings of biblical themes.

==Early life==
[[File:Eakins, Henry Ossawa Tanner 1902.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Eakins]], a ''Portrait of Henry O. Tanner'', 1900. Oil on canvas, 24⅛" × 20¼". [[The Hyde Collection]].]]
Tanner was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the first of seven children.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite web|title=Race, Religion, and Visual Mysticism|author=Kelly Jeanette Baker|publisher=Florida State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; His middle name commemorated the struggle at [[Battle of Osawatomie|Osawatomie]] between pro- and anti-slavery partisans.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt; His father [[Benjamin Tucker Tanner]] (1835-1923) was a bishop in the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], the first independent black denomination in the United States. Being educated at [[Avery College]] and [[Western Theological Seminary]] in Pittsburgh, he developed a literary career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://loc.gov/exhibits/civil-war-in-america/biographies/benjamin-tucker-tanner.html The Civil War in America: Benjamin Tucker Tanner], ''Library of Congress Exhibitions''&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he was a political [[activist]]. His mother Sarah Tanner was born into [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] in Virginia but had escaped to the North via the [[Underground Railroad]]. She was of mixed race, and Tanner himself was either a quadroon or an octoroon.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;

The family moved to [[Philadelphia]] when Tanner was young. There his father became a friend of [[Frederick Douglass]], sometimes supporting him, sometimes criticizing.&lt;ref name="eoaah" &gt;{{Cite book

==Education==
[[File:Henry Ossawa Tanner - Spinning By Firelight (1894).jpg|thumb|left|200 px|''Spinning By Firelight'', 1894]]
Although many artists refused to accept an African-American apprentice, in 1879 Tanner enrolled at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in Philadelphia, becoming the only black student.&lt;ref name="eoaah"/&gt; His decision to attend the school came at an exciting time in the history of artistic institutional training.  Art academies had long relied on tired notions of study devoted almost entirely to plaster cast studies and anatomy lectures. This changed drastically with the addition of [[Thomas Eakins]] as "Professor of Drawing and Painting" to the Pennsylvania Academy. Eakins encouraged new methods, such as study from live models, direct discussion of anatomy in male and female classes, and dissections of cadavers to further familiarity and understanding of the human body. Eakins's progressive views and ability to excite and inspire his students would have a profound effect on Tanner. The young artist proved to be one of Eakins' favorite students; two decades after Tanner left the Academy,  Eakins painted his portrait, making him one of a handful of students to be so honored.&lt;ref name="Parry, Ellwood C. III"&gt;Parry, Ellwood C. III. ''Three Nineteenth Century Afro-American Artists.'' Cedar Rapids, IA: Cedar Rapids Art Center, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Academy Tanner befriended artists with whom he kept in contact throughout the rest of his life, most notably [[Robert Henri]], one of the founders of the [[Ashcan School]]. During a relatively short time at the Academy, Tanner developed a thorough knowledge of anatomy and the skill to express his understanding of the weight and structure of the human figure on the canvas.&lt;ref name="Matthews, Marcia"&gt;Matthews, Marcia.''Henry Ossawa Tanner:American Artist''. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues of racism==
Although he gained confidence as an artist and began to sell his work, he had to deal with [[racism]] in Philadelphia. It had traditionally had strong ties to the South through numerous planter families and commercial ties; in addition, planters had sent their daughters to Philadelphia academies. After the Civil War, many African Americans left the rural South and settled in Northern urban centers, at times coming into conflict with the increasing population of immigrants from Ireland, southern and eastern Europe. Although painting became a therapeutic source of release for Tanner, the lack of acceptance in society was painful.  In his autobiography ''The Story of an Artist's Life'', Tanner describes the burden of racism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was extremely timid and to be made to feel that I was not wanted, although in a place where I had every right to be, even months afterwards caused me sometimes weeks of pain.  Every time any one of these disagreeable incidents came into my mind, my heart sank, and I was anew tortured by the thought of what I had endured, almost as much as the incident itself.&lt;ref name="Bruce, Marcus C."/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an attempt to gain artistic acceptance, Tanner left America for France in late 1891.  Except for occasional brief returns home, he spent the rest of his life there.

==Life abroad==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Arch - Henry Ossawa Tanner - overall.jpg|thumb|left|''The Arch'', ca. 1914, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]

After a photography studio in [[Atlanta]] had been unsuccessful, Tanner taught drawing at Clark College which is now called [[Clark Atlanta University]] for a short period.&lt;ref name =Springfield&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spfld-museum-of-art.org/collection/tanner.html  | title=Henry Ossawa Tanner | publisher=Springfield Museum of Art |accessdate=August 5, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060110063014/http://www.spfld-museum-of-art.org/collection/tanner.html |archivedate = January 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891 he traveled to [[Paris]], France, to study at the [[Académie Julian]]. He also joined the [[American Art Students Club]] of Paris. Paris was a welcome escape for Tanner; within French art circles the issue of race mattered little.  Tanner acclimated quickly to Parisian life.

In Paris, he was introduced to many new artists whose works would affect the way in which Tanner painted.  At the [[Louvre]], he encountered and studied the works of [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Jean-Baptiste Chardin]] and [[Louis Le Nain]].&lt;ref name="Shaw, Thomas M."&gt;Shaw, Thomas M. ''What Manner of Men? A Reconsideration across the Synapses of Art History of Three Paintings and their Images of Men of African Descent.'' Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; These artists had painted scenes of ordinary people in their environment and the effect in Tanner's work is noticeable. The influence of Courbet's ''The Stonebreakers'' (1850; Destroyed) can be seen in the similarities painted by Tanner in his ''The Young Sabot Maker'' (1895). Both paintings explore the theme of apprenticeship and hand labor.&lt;ref name="Shaw, Thomas M."/&gt;

He studied under renowned artists such as [[Jean Joseph Benjamin Constant]] and [[Jean-Paul Laurens]].&lt;ref name="Bruce, Marcus C."&gt;Bruce, Marcus C. ''Henry Ossawa Tanner.'' New York: The Crossroad Publishing Company, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; With their guidance, Tanner began to establish a reputation. He settled at the [[Étaples art colony]] in Normandy. Earlier Tanner painted marine scenes that showed man's struggle with the sea, but by 1895 he was creating mostly religious works. A transitional work from this period is the recently rediscovered painting of a fishing boat tossed on the waves, which is held by the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Details on the [http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=23651 museum site]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Henry Ossawa Tanner - The Good Shepherd - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Good Shepherd'', 1902–1903]]
This is based on the description of a miracle in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in which 'the boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary' (14:24). The simple resources at Étaples were well adapted to his subject matter, which in several cases featured Biblical figures in dark interiors.

His painting entitled ''Daniel in the Lions' Den'' was accepted into the 1896 [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]].&lt;ref name="Matthews, Marcia"/&gt; Later that year he painted ''The Resurrection of Lazarus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://negroartist.com/negro%20artist/Henry%20Ossawa%20Tanner/pages/Henry%20Ossawa%20Tanner%20Daniel%20In%20The%20Lions%20Den_jpg.htm |title=Negro Artist site |publisher=Negroartist.com |date= |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The critical praise for this piece solidified Tanner's position in the artistic elite and heralded the future direction of his paintings, which treated mostly biblical themes. Upon seeing ''The Resurrection of Lazarus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://negroartist.com/negro%20artist/Henry%20Ossawa%20Tanner/pages/Henry%20Tanner%20The%20Resurrection%20of%20Lazarus%201896_jpg.htm |title=Negro Artist site |publisher=Negroartist.com |date= |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; art critic [[Rodman Wanamaker]] offered to cover an all expenses-paid trip for Tanner to the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Matthews, Marcia"/&gt; Wanamaker felt that any serious painter of biblical scenes needed to see the environment firsthand and that a painter of Tanner's caliber was well worth the investment.

Tanner quickly accepted the offer. Before the next Salon opened, Tanner set forth for Palestine. Explorations of various mosques and biblical sites as well as character studies of the local population allowed Tanner to further his artistic training. His paintings developed a powerful air of mystery and spirituality. Tanner was not the first artist to study the Middle East in person. Since the 1830s, interest in [[Orientalism]] had been growing in Europe. Artists such as [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], and later Henri [[Matisse]] made such tours to capitalize on this curiosity.&lt;ref name="Matthews, Marcia"/&gt;

In his adopted home of France, he was given one of their highest honors in 1923, when he was appointed Chevalier of the [[Legion of Honor]], the highest national order of merit, and considered this "citation by the French government to be the greatest honor of his illustrious career."&lt;ref name="PMA Cat"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mosby|first1=Dewey F.|last2=Sewell|first2=Darrell|last3=Alexander-Minter|first3=Rae|title=Henry Ossawa Tanner: catalogue|date=1991|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=0-87633-086-3|page=32|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Banjo Lesson''==
[[File:Henry Ossawa Tanner - The Banjo Lesson.jpg|thumb|upright|Henry Ossawa Tanner, ''The Banjo Lesson'', 1893]]

In 1893 on a short return visit to the United States, Tanner painted his most famous work, ''The Banjo Lesson,'' while in Philadelphia. The painting shows an elderly black man teaching a boy, assumed to be his grandson, how to play the banjo. This deceptively simple-looking work explores several important themes.  Blacks had long been stereotyped as entertainers in American culture, and the image of a black man playing the banjo appears throughout American art of the late 19th century. Thomas Worth,&lt;ref name="Woods, Naurice Frank, Jr., Ph.D."&gt;Woods, Naurice Frank, Jr., Ph.D. ''Insuperable Obstacles: The Impact of the Creative and Personal Development of Four Nineteenth Century African American Artists.'' The Union Institute, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Willy Miller, Walter M. Dunk, Eastman Johnson, and Tanner's teacher Thomas Eakins had tackled the subject in their artwork.&lt;ref name="Shaw, Thomas M."/&gt;

These images are often reduced to a minstrel-type portrayal. Tanner painted a sensitive reinterpretation. Instead of a generalization, the painting portrays a specific moment of human interaction. The two characters concentrate intently on the task before them. They seem to be oblivious to the rest of the world, which enlarges the sense of real contact and cooperation. The skillfully painted portraits of the individuals make it obvious that these are real people and not types.

In addition to being a meaningful exploration of human qualities, the piece is masterfully painted. Tanner undertakes the difficult endeavor of portraying two separate and varying light sources. A natural white, blue glow from outside enters from the left while the warm light from a fireplace is apparent on the right. The figures are illuminated where the two light sources meet; some have hypothesized this as a manifestation of Tanner's situation in transition between two worlds, his American past and his newfound home in France.&lt;ref name="Shaw, Thomas M."/&gt;

==Painting style==
[[File:Henry Ossawa Tanner - The Annunciation.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Ossawa Tanner, ''The Annunciation'', 1898, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]]]
Tanner is often regarded as a [[Realism (arts)|realist]] painter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/tanner_henry_ossawa.html | title=Henry Ossawa Tanner Online | accessdate=August 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on accurate depictions of subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c19th/realism.htm | archive-url= http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091007214144/http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c19th/realism.htm | dead-url= yes | archive-date= October 7, 2009 | title= Realism - Realism Art | accessdate= August 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While works such as ''The Banjo Lesson'' were concerned with everyday life as an African American, Tanner later painted themes based on religious subjects, for which he is now best known.&lt;ref name =Springfield /&gt; It is likely that Tanner's father, a minister in the [[African Methodist Episcopal]] Church, was a formative influence for him.&lt;ref name="Matthews, Marcia"/&gt;

Tanner's body of work is not limited to one specific approach to painting and drawing. His works vary from meticulous attention to detail in some paintings to loose, [[expressionism|expressive]] brushstrokes in others. Often both methods are employed simultaneously. The combination of these two techniques makes for a masterful balance of skillful precision and powerful expression. Tanner was also interested in the effects that color could have in a painting.&lt;ref name="Kettlewell, James K."&gt;Kettlewell, James K. ''The Art of Henry Ossawa Tanner.'' Glen Falls, NY: The Hyde Collection, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of his paintings accentuate a specific area of the color spectrum.  Warmer compositions such as ''The Resurrection of Lazarus'' (1896) and ''The Annunciation'' (1898) express the intensity and fire of religious moments, and the elation of transcendence between the divine and humanity. Other paintings emphasize cooler, blue hues.  Works such as ''The Good Shepherd'' (1903) and ''Return of the Holy Women'' (1904) evoke a feeling of somber religiosity and introspection. Tanner often experimented with light in a composition. The source and intensity of light and shadow in his paintings create a physical, almost tangible space and atmosphere while adding emotion and mood to the environment. Tanner also used light to add symbolic meaning to his paintings. In The Annunciation (1898) the angel Gabriel is represented as a column of light that forms, together with the shelf in the upper left corner, a cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/doc_downloads/education/object_resources/104384.pdf|title=Teacher Resources:  The Annunciation|last=|first=|date=|website=The Annunciation, Henry Ossawa Tanner|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art|access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view of the representation of Gabriel is consistent with James Romaine's comment that "Through the visual language of her pose and expression Tanner draws the viewer into Mary's inner life of virtue, trepidation, acceptance, and wonderment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Romaine|first=James|date=Summer 2012|title=Henry Ossawa Tanner: Painting Belief|url=|journal=Art &amp; Christianity|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary's acceptance includes her acceptance of the cross that she will have to bear by consenting to be the Lord's handmaid (Luke 1:38).

==Marriage and family==
[[File:Henry Ossawa Tanner Family.jpg|thumb|The Tanner family at home in France. Handwritten note on verso identifies the individuals seated at the table as: Jesse Tanner, Mrs. Tanner, Barlow, Henry Ossawa Tanner.]]
In 1899 he married Jessie Olsson, a white Swedish-American opera singer.&lt;ref&gt;Marley, Anna O. "Introduction" in ''Modern Spirit'' Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Philadelphia. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary, Virginia Walker Course, described their relationship as one of equal talents, but racist attitudes insisted the relationship was unequal: 
"Fan, did you ever hear of a miss [sic] Olsson of Portland? She has a beautiful voice I believe and came to Paris to cultivate it and she has married a darkey artist ... He is an awefully [sic] talented man but he is black. ... She seems like a well educated girl and really very nice but it makes me sick to see a cultivated woman marry a man like that. I don't know his work but he is very talented they say."&lt;ref&gt;Course, Virginia Walker qtd. by Jean-Claude Lesage in "Tanner, The Pillar of Trepied."''Modern Spirit'' Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Philadelphia. 2012, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;
Jessie Tanner died in 1925, twelve years before her husband, and he grieved her deeply through the Twenties. He sold the family home in Les Charmes where they had been so happy together. They are buried next to each other in Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine.&lt;ref&gt;Marley (2012), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;
They had a son Jesse, who survived Tanner at his death.&lt;ref name="Springfield"/&gt;

==Later years==
[[File:Henry Ossawa Tanner - Sodom and Gomorrha.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Sodom and Gomorrha'', 1920]]
During [[World War I]], Tanner worked for the [[Red Cross]] Public Information Department, during which time he also painted images from the front lines of the war.&lt;ref name=esper&gt;{{cite web | url = http://esperstamps.org/aa8.htm | title = Henry Ossawa Tanner | accessdate = August 9, 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060829020120/http://esperstamps.org/aa8.htm | archivedate = August 29, 2006 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His works featuring African-American troops were rare during the war. In 1923 the French state made him a knight of the [[Legion of Honour]] for his work as an artist.

Tanner met with fellow African-American artist [[Palmer Hayden]] in Paris circa 1927. They discussed artistic technique and he gave Hayden advice on interacting with French society.&lt;ref&gt;

Several of Tanner's paintings were purchased by Atlanta art collector [[J. J. Haverty]], who founded [[Havertys|Haverty Furniture Co.]] and was instrumental in establishing the [[High Museum of Art]]. Tanner's ''[[:File:Etaples Fisher Folk by Henry Ossawa Tanner, 1923, High Museum of Art.jpg|Étaples Fisher Folk]]'' is among several paintings from the Haverty collection now in the High Museum's permanent collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.high.org/collections/permanent/default.aspx|title=Page Not Found|publisher=|accessdate=April 1, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924030111/http://www.high.org/collections/permanent/default.aspx|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanner died peacefully at his home in Paris, France, on May 25, 1937.&lt;ref name = esper/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:The Seine - Henry Ossawa Tanner.jpg|thumb|Henry Ossawa Tanner, ''[[Seine|The Seine]]'' (c. 1902), one of three paintings by African Americans on display in 2012 in the [[National Gallery of Art]]'s American Art galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.artinfo.com/modernartnotes/2012/02/a-modest-improvement-at-the-national-gallery/ |title=A modest improvement at the National Gallery &amp;#124; Tyler Green: Modern Art Notes &amp;#124; ARTINFO.com |publisher=Blogs.artinfo.com |date=2012-02-03 |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Tanner's work was influential during his career; he has been called "the greatest African American painter to date."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early paintings of [[William Edouard Scott]], who studied with Tanner in France, show the influence of Tanner's technique.&lt;ref name="Shaw, Thomas M."/&gt;  In addition, some of [[Norman Rockwell]]'s illustrations deal with the same themes and compositions that Tanner pursued.  Rockwell's proposed cover of the ''[[Literary Digest]]'' in 1922, for example, shows an older black man playing the banjo for his grandson.  The light sources are nearly identical to those in Tanner's ''Banjo Lesson.''  A fireplace illuminates the right side of the picture, while natural light enters from the left.  Both use similar objects as well such as the clothing, chair, crumpled hat on the floor.&lt;ref name="Shaw, Thomas M."/&gt;

Tanner's ''Sand Dunes at Sunset, Atlantic City'' (c. 1885; oil on canvas) hangs in the [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]] at the [[White House]]; it is the first painting by an African-American artist to have been purchased for the permanent collection of the White House. The painting is a landscape with a "view across the cool gray of a shadowed beach to dunes made pink by the late afternoon sunlight. A low haze over the water partially hides the sun."  It was bought for $100,000 by the White House Endowment Fund during the [[Bill Clinton]] administration from Dr. Rae Alexander-Minter, grandniece of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/EOP/First_Lady/html/102296.html "White House Announces Acquisition of Henry Ossawa Tanner Painting for Permanent White House Collection"].

'''''Heta-uma''''' ({{lang|ja|ヘタウマ}} or {{lang|ja|ヘタうま}}) is a Japanese underground [[manga]] movement started in the 1970 decade with the magazine ''[[Garo (magazine)|Garo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artreview.com/opinion/ara_spring_2015_opinion_paul_gravett/|title=The ‘bad but good’ trailblazing of Yumura Teruhiko, by Paul Gravett / ArtReview|last=name|first=Site|website=artreview.com|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Heta-uma'' can be translated as "bad but good", designating a work which looks poorly drawn, but with an aesthetically conscious quality, opposed to the polished look of mainstream manga.

'''House-Museum of Uzeyir Hajibeyov''' – is a house-museum of famous Azerbaijani composer [[Uzeyir Hajibeyov]], opened in 1959.

==History==
In the museum, along with household items belonging to the Hajibeyov family, Uzeyir bey's personal belongings, pictures, books, books dedicated to him and the museum are exhibited in the exposition. In 1985, the 100th anniversary of Uzeyir Hajibeyov was celebrated by UNESCO, guests from many countries of the world. They visited Hajibeyov's house-museum in Shusha where jubilee events were held.

On May 8, 1992, the museum stopped its activity after occupation of Shusha by Armenian forces. From the exhibits of the museum, personal belongings of Hajibeyov were brought to Baku. Currently they are stored in the funds of U.Hajibeyov's house-museum in Baku. The exhibits brought from Shusha are composed of: Uzeyir Bey's personal belongings, childhood hat, costume, sunglasses, coat, his violin played at the Gori Seminary , writing accessories, ink-pot, pencil, personal album, photos, her mother Shirinbayim khanim's bride dressing, books dedicated to Hajibeyov's life and creativity. One of the most valuable exhibits brought to Baku is the handful of Shusha land of a pear tree, Uzeyir bey's favorite in the yard of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Şuşada Ü.Hacıbəyovun ev-muzeyi|url=http://uzeyir.musigi-dunya.az/az/dom_muzey_shusha.html|website= uzeyir.musigi-dunya.az|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Humour''' ([[British English]]), also known as '''humor''' ([[American English]]; [[American and British English spelling differences#-our, -or|see spelling differences]]) is the tendency of experiences to provoke [[laughter]] and provide [[amusement]]. The term derives from the [[humorism|humoral medicine]] of the [[ancient Greeks]], which taught that the balance of fluids in the human body, known as humours ([[Latin]]: ''humor'', "body fluid"), controlled human health and emotion.

People of all ages and cultures respond to humour. Most people are able to experience humour—be amused, smile or laugh at something funny—and thus are considered to have a ''sense of humour''. The hypothetical person lacking a sense of humour would likely find the behaviour inducing it to be inexplicable, strange, or even irrational. Though ultimately decided by personal [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]], the extent to which a person finds something humorous depends on a host of variables, including [[geographical location]], [[culture]], [[Maturity (psychological)|maturity]], level of [[education]], [[intelligence]] and [[wiktionary:context|context]]. For example, young children may favour [[slapstick]] such as [[Punch and Judy]] puppet shows or the ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, whose physical nature makes it accessible to them. By contrast, more sophisticated forms of humour such as [[satire]] require an understanding of its social meaning and context, and thus tend to appeal to a more mature audience.

==Theories==
{{main article|Theories of humour}}
Many theories exist about what humour is and what social function it serves. The prevailing types of theories attempting to account for the existence of humour include [[psychology|psychological]] theories, the vast majority of which consider humour-induced behaviour to be very healthy; spiritual theories, which may, for instance, consider humour to be a "gift from God"; and theories which consider humour to be an unexplainable mystery, very much like a [[mysticism|mystical experience]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Smullyan]], "The Planet Without Laughter", ''[[This Book Needs No Title]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The benign-violation theory, endorsed by [[Peter McGraw]], attempts to explain humour's existence. The theory says 'humour only occurs when something seems wrong, unsettling, or threatening, but simultaneously seems okay, acceptable or safe'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter McGraw]], "Too close for Comfort, or Too Far to care? Finding Humor in Distant Tragedies and Close Mishaps"&lt;/ref&gt; Humour can be used as a method to easily engage in social interaction by taking away that awkward, uncomfortable, or uneasy feeling of social interactions.

Others believe that 'the appropriate use of humour can facilitate social interactions'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Kuiper]], "Prudence and Racial Humor: Troubling Epithets"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
Some claim that humour should not be explained. Author [[E.B. White]] once said, "Humor can be dissected as a frog can, but the thing dies in the process and the innards are discouraging to any but the pure scientific mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/984.html|title=The Quotations Page: Quote from E. B. White|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counter to this argument, protests against "offensive" cartoons invite the dissection of humour or its lack by aggrieved individuals and communities. This process of dissecting humour does not necessarily banish a sense of humour but begs attention towards its politics and assumed universality (Khanduri 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Ritu Gairola Khanduri. 2014. [http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/authors/246935 Caricaturing Culture in India: Cartoons and History of the Modern World]. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] lamented the misuse of ''humour'' (a [[German language|German]] [[loanword]] from [[English language|English]]) to mean any type of [[comedy]]. However, both ''humour'' and ''comic'' are often used when theorising about the subject. The connotations of ''humour'' as opposed to ''comic'' are said to be that of response versus stimulus. Additionally, ''humour'' was thought to include a combination of ridiculousness and wit in an individual; the paradigmatic case being Shakespeare's Sir John Falstaff. The French were slow to adopt the term ''humour''; in French, ''humeur'' and ''humour'' are still two different words, the former referring to a person's [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] or to the archaic concept of the four [[Four Temperaments|humours]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Non-satirical humour can be specifically termed ''droll humour'' or ''recreational drollery''.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Benedict Graham ''[http://etd.library.pitt.edu/ETD/available/etd-11032003-192424/unrestricted/grahamsethb_etd2003.pdf A cultural analysis of the Russo-Soviet Anekdot]'' 2003 p.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, Mikhail. ''Rabelais and His World'' [1941, 1965]. Trans. Hélène Iswolsky. Bloomington: Indiana University Press p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological factors==

As with any art form, the acceptance of a particular style or incidence of humour depends on [[sociology|sociological]] factors and varies from person to person. Throughout history, comedy has been used as a form of entertainment all over the world, whether in the courts of the Western kings or the villages of the Far East. Both a social etiquette and a certain intelligence can be displayed through forms of [[wit]] and [[sarcasm]]. Eighteenth-century [[Germany|German]] author [[Georg Lichtenberg]] said that "the more you know humour, the more you become demanding in fineness."{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Ancient Greece===
Western humour theory begins with [[Plato]], who attributed to [[Socrates]] (as a semi-historical dialogue character) in the ''[[Philebus]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;49b) the view that the essence of the [[ridiculous]] is an ignorance in the weak, who are thus unable to retaliate when ridiculed. Later, in Greek philosophy, [[Aristotle]], in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (1449a, pp.&amp;nbsp;34–35), suggested that an ugliness that does not disgust is fundamental to humour.

===India===
In ancient [[Sanskrit drama]], [[Bharata Muni]]'s ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' defined humour (''hāsyam'') as one of the nine ''[[nava rasas]]'', or principle ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasas]]'' (emotional responses), which can be inspired in the audience by ''[[bhava]]s'', the imitations of emotions that the actors perform. Each ''rasa'' was associated with a specific ''[[bhava]]s'' portrayed on stage.

===In Arabic and Persian culture===
[[file:Hadith imam baqir.svg|thumb|Muhammad al-Baqir's [[Hadith]] about humour]]
The terms [[comedy]] and [[satire]] became synonymous after Aristotle's ''Poetics'' was translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], where it was elaborated upon by [[Arabic literature|Arabic writers]] and [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] such as [[Abu Bishr Matta ibn Yunus|Abu Bischr]], his pupil [[Al-Farabi]], Persian [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]. Due to cultural differences, they disassociated comedy from [[Greek drama]]tic representation, and instead identified it with Arabic poetic themes and forms, such as ''hija'' (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the "art of reprehension" and made no reference to light and cheerful events or troublesome beginnings and happy endings associated with classical Greek comedy. After the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], the term ''comedy'' thus gained a new semantic meaning in [[Medieval literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Comedy as Satire in Hispano-Arabic Spain|first=Edwin J.|last=Webber|journal=Hispanic Review|volume=26|issue=1|date=January 1958|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|pages=1–11|doi=10.2307/470561|jstor=470561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caribbean===
[[Mento]] star [[Lord Flea]], stated in a 1957 interview that he thought that: "[[West Indians]] have the best sense of humour in the world. Even in the most solemn song, like ''Las Kean Fine'' ["Lost and Can Not Be Found"], which tells of a boiler explosion on a sugar plantation that killed several of the workers, their natural wit and humour shine though."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Garnice|date=11 March 2012|accessdate=14 April 2013|url=http://www.mentomusic.com/flea.htm|title=Mento Music Lord Flea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
[[Confucianism|Confucianist]] Neo-Confucian orthodoxy, with its emphasis on ritual and propriety, has traditionally looked down upon humour as subversive or unseemly. Humor was perceived as irony and sarcasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xiao|first=Dong Yue|date=|title=Exploration of Chinese humor: Historical review, empirical findings, and critical reflections|url=|journal=Humor|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1515/HUMR.2010.018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Confucian "Analects" itself, however, depicts the Master as fond of humorous self-deprecation, once comparing his wanderings to the existence of a homeless dog.&lt;ref&gt;C. Harbsmeier, "Confucius-Ridens, Humor in the Analects." Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies 50. 1 : 131-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Early Daoist philosophical texts such as "Zhuangzi" pointedly make fun of Confucian seriousness and make Confucius himself a slow-witted figure of fun.&lt;ref&gt;Jocelyn Chey and Jessica Milner Davis, eds. "Humour in Chinese Life and Letters: Classical and Traditional Approaches" (HKUP, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Joke books containing a mix of wordplay, puns, situational humour, and play with taboo subjects like [[sex]] and scatology, remained popular over the centuries. Local performing arts, storytelling, vernacular fiction, and poetry offer a wide variety of humorous styles and sensibilities.

Famous Chinese humorists include the ancient jesters Chunyu Kun and Dongfang Shuo; writers of the Ming and Qing dynasties such as [[Feng Menglong]], Li Yu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674332270|title=The Invention of Li Yu — Patrick Hanan - Harvard University Press|website=www.hup.harvard.edu|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wu Jingzi]]; and modern comic writers such as [[Lu Xun]], [[Lin Yutang]], [[Lao She]], [[Qian Zhongshu]], [[Wang Xiaobo]], and [[Wang Shuo]], and performers such as [[Ge You]], [[Guo Degang]], and [[Zhou Libo (comedian)|Zhou Libo]].

Modern Chinese humor has been heavily influenced not only by indigenous traditions, but also by foreign humor, circulated via print culture, cinema, television, and the internet.&lt;ref&gt;"Comic Visions of Modern China": http://u.osu.edu/mclc/files/2014/09/intro20.2-158jzq5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s, the transliteration "youmo" (humour) caught on as a new term for humour, sparking a fad for humour literature, as well as impassioned debate about what type of humorous sensibility best suited China, a poor, weak country under partial foreign occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Rea, "[http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520283848 The Age of Irreverence]: A New History of Laughter in China" (University of California Press, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/sml/research/publication/195282 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002100340/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/sml/research/publication/195282 |archivedate=2016-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/sml/research/publication/195315 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002100338/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/sml/research/publication/195315 |archivedate=2016-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some types of comedy were officially sanctioned during the rule of Mao Zedong, the Party-state's approach towards humour was generally repressive.&lt;ref&gt;David Moser, "Stifled Laughter": http://www.danwei.org/tv/stifled_laughter_how_the_commu.php&lt;/ref&gt; Social liberalisation in the 1980s, commercialisation of the cultural market in the 1990s, and the advent of the internet have each—despite an invasive state-sponsored censorship apparatus—enabled new forms of humour to flourish in China in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Milner Davis and Jocelyn Chey, eds. "Humour in Chinese Life and Culture: Resistance and Control in Modern Times" (HKUP, 2013): http://www.hkupress.org/Common/Reader/Products/ShowProduct.jsp?Pid=1&amp;Version=0&amp;Cid=16&amp;Charset=iso-8859-1&amp;page=-1&amp;key=9789888139248&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social transformation model ===
The social transformation model of humour predicts that specific characteristics, such as physical attractiveness, interact with humour.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Heterosexual romantic preferences: The importance of humor and physical attractiveness for different types of relationships|last = Lundy, Tan, Cunningham|date = 1998|journal = Personal Relationships|doi = 10.1111/j.1475-6811.1998.tb00174.x|pmid = |volume=5 |issue = 3|pages=311–325}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model involves linkages between the humorist, an audience, and the subject matter of the humour.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The two transformations associated with this particular model involves the subject matter of the humour, and the change in the audiences perception of the humorous person, therefore establishing a relationship between the humorous speaker and the audience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The social transformation model views humour as adaptive because it communicates the present desire to be humorous as well as future intentions of being humorous.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This model is used with deliberate [[self-deprecating humour]] where one is communicating with desires to be accepted into someone else’s specific social group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although self-deprecating humour communicates weakness and fallibility in the bid to gain another's affection, it can be concluded from the model that this type of humour can increase romantic attraction towards the humorist when other variables are also favourable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The social transformation model can also be followed in teaching and lecturing where humour is used to improve the cognitive capabilities of the students. Humour could create a positive and informal classroom environment that triggers students’ enthusiasm and interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Higher Education Lecturing and Humor: From Perspectives to Strategies|author1=Nasiri, F. |author2=Mafakheri, F. |date = 2015| journal = Higher Education Studies| doi = 10.5539/hes.v5n5p26 |volume=5 |issue=5|pages=26–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical attractiveness ===
90% of men and 81% of women, all college students, report having a sense of humour is a crucial characteristic looked for in a romantic partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Student perceptions of traits desired in themselves as dating and marriage partners|last = Hewitt|first = L|date = 1958|journal = Marriage and Family Living|doi = 10.2307/348256|pmid = |access-date =|volume=20|pages=344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humour and honesty were ranked as the two most important attributes in a significant other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sex differences among partner preferences: Are the sexes really very similar?|last = Goodwin|first = R|date = 1990|journal = Sex Roles|doi = 10.1007/bf00289765|pmid = |access-date =|volume=23|pages=501–513}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been recorded that humour becomes more evident and significantly more important as the level of commitment in a romantic relationship increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Evolution, traits, and the stages of the parental investment model|last = Kenrick, Sadalla, Groth, Trost|date = 1990|journal = Journal of Personality|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.1990.tb00909.x|pmid = |access-date = |volume=58 |pages=97–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research suggests expressions of humour in relation to [[physical attractiveness]] are two major factors in the desire for future interaction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women regard physical attractiveness less highly compared to men when it came to dating, a serious relationship, and sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, women rate humorous men more desirable than nonhumorous individuals for a serious relationship or marriage, but only when these men were physically attractive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Furthermore, humorous people are perceived by others to be more cheerful but less intellectual than nonhumorous people. [[Self-deprecating humour]] has been found to increase the desirability of physically attractive others for committed relationships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The results of a study conducted by [[McMaster University]] suggest humour can positively affect one’s desirability for a specific relationship partner, but this effect is only most likely to occur when men use humour and are evaluated by women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = The influence of humour on desirability|last = Bressler, Balshine|date = 2006|journal = Evolution and Human Behavior|doi = 10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2005.06.002|pmid = |access-date = |volume=27 |pages=29–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; No evidence was found to suggest men prefer women with a sense of humour as partners, nor women preferring other women with a sense of humour as potential partners.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When women were given the forced-choice design in the study, they chose funny men as potential relationship partners even though they rated them as being less honest and intelligent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Post-Hoc analysis showed no relationship between humour quality and favourable judgments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It is generally known that humour contributes to higher subjective wellbeing (both physical and psychological).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Humor and self-concept|last = Kuiper &amp; Martin|date = 1993|journal = Humor-International Journal of Humor Research|doi = 10.1515/humr.1993.6.3.251|pmid = |access-date = |volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous research on humour and [[psychological well-being]] show that humour is in fact a major factor in achieving, and sustaining, higher psychological wellbeing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name= Bos&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bos, E.H.|author2=Snippe, E.|author3=de Jonge, P.|author4=Jeronimus, B.F.| year = 2016 | title = Preserving Subjective Wellbeing in the Face of Psychopathology: Buffering Effects of Personal Strengths and Resources | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11| issue = | pages = e0150867| url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0150867 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0150867 | pmid=26963923}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is known as general facilitative hypothesis for humour.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; That is, positive humour leads to positive health. Not all contemporary research, however, supports the previous assertion that humour is in fact a cause for healthier psychological wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Laughter and stress in daily life: Relation to positive and negative affect|last = Kuiper &amp; Martin|date = 1998|journal = Motivation and emotion|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the previous researches’ limitations is that they tend to use a unidimensional approach to humour because it was always inferred that humour was deemed positive. They did not consider the types of humour, or [[humor styles|humour styles]]. For example, self-defeating or aggressive humour.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Individual differences in uses of humor and their relation to psychological well-being: Development of the humor styles questionnaire|last = Martin, Puhlik-Doris, Larsen, Gray., &amp; Weir|date = 2003|journal = Journal of Research in Personality|doi = 10.1016/s0092-6566(02)00534-2|pmid = |access-date = |volume=37 |pages=48–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has proposed 2 types of humour that each consist of 2 styles, making 4 styles in total. The two types are adaptive versus maladaptive humour.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Adaptive humour consist of facilitative and self-enhancing humour, and maladaptive is self-defeating and aggressive humour. Each of these styles can have a different impact on psychological and individuals’ overall subjective wellbeing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

#Affiliative style humour. Individuals with this dimension of humour tend to use jokes as a mean of affiliating relationships, amuse others, and reduce tensions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
#Self-enhancing style humour. People that fall under this dimension of humour tend to take a humorous perspective of life. Individuals with self-enhancing humour tend to use it as a mechanism to cope with [[Stress (biology)|stress]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
#Aggressive humour. Racist jokes, sarcasm and disparagement of individuals for the purpose of amusement. This type of humour is used by people who do not consider the consequences of their jokes, and mainly focus on the entertainment of the listeners.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
#Self-defeating humour. People with this style of humour tend to amuse others by using self-disparaging jokes, and also tend to laugh along with others when being taunted. It is hypothesised that people use this style of humour as a mean of social acceptance. It is also mentioned that these people may have an implicit feeling of negativity. So they use this humour as a means of hiding that inner negative feeling.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In the study on humour and psychological well-being, research has concluded that high levels of adaptive type humour (affiliative and self-enhancing) is associated with better self-esteem, positive affect, greater self-competency, as well as anxiety control and social interactions.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Humor is not always the best medicine: Specific components of sense of humor and psychological well-being|last = Kuiper, Grimshaw, Leite., &amp; Kirsh|date = 2004|journal = Humor: International journal of Humor Research|doi = 10.1515/humr.2004.002|pmid = |access-date = |volume=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of which are constituents of psychological wellbeing. Additionally, adaptive humour styles may enable people to preserve their sense of wellbeing despite psychological problems.&lt;ref name= Bos/&gt; In contrast, maladaptive humour types (aggressive and self-defeating) are associated with poorer overall psychological wellbeing,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; emphasis on higher levels of anxiety and depression. Therefore, humour may have detrimental effects on psychological wellbeing, only if that humour is of negative characteristics.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Physiological effects ==
[[File:Boris Yeltsin with Bill Clinton-1.jpg|thumbnail|[[Boris Yeltsin]] and  [[Bill Clinton]] enjoying a joke, in spite of their language differences]]
Humour is often used to make light of difficult or stressful situations and to brighten up a social atmosphere in general. It is regarded by many as an enjoyable and positive experience, so it would be reasonable to assume that it humour might have some positive physiological effects on the body.

A study designed to test the positive physiological effects of humour,  the relationship between being exposed to humour and pain tolerance in particular, was conducted in 1994 by Karen Zwyer, Barbara Velker, and Willibald Ruch. To test the effects of humour on pain tolerance the test subjects were first exposed to a short humorous video clip and then exposed to the Cold Press Test. To identify the aspects of humour which might contribute to an increase in pain tolerance the study separated its fifty six female participants into three groups, cheerfulness, exhilaration and humour production. The subjects were further separated into two groups, high Trait-Cheerfulness and high Trait-Seriousness according to the State-Trait-Cheerfulness-Inventory. The instructions for the three groups were as follows: the cheerfulness group were told to get excited about the movie without laughing or smiling, the exhilaration group was told to laugh and smile excessively, exaggerating their natural reactions, the humour production group was told to make humorous comments about the video clip as they watched. To ensure that the participants actually found the movie humorous and that it produced the desired effects the participants took a survey on the topic which resulted in a mean score of 3.64 out of 5. The results of the Cold Press Test showed that the participants in all three groups experienced a higher pain threshold, a higher pain tolerance and a lower pain tolerance than previous to the film. The results did not show a  significant difference between the three groups.&lt;ref&gt;"Do cheerfulness, exhilaration, and humor production moderate pain tolerance? A FACS study". ''ResearchGate''. Retrieved 2015-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also potential relationships between humour and having a healthy immune system. SIgA is a type of antibody that protects the body from infections. In a method similar to the previous experiment, the participants were shown a short humorous video clip and then tested for the effects. The participants showed a significant increase in SIgA levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bennett | first1 = Mary Payne | last2 = Lengacher | first2 = Cecile | year = 2009 | title = Humor and Laughter May Influence Health IV. Humor and Immune Function | url = | journal = Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 159–164 | doi = 10.1093/ecam/nem149 | pmid = 18955287 | pmc=2686627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been claims that laughter can be a supplement for cardiovascular exercise and might increase muscle tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bennett | first1 = Mary Payne | last2 = Lengacher | first2 = Cecile | year = 2008 | title = Humor and Laughter May Influence Health: III. Laughter and Health Outcomes | url = | journal = Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 37–40 | doi = 10.1093/ecam/nem041 | pmid = 18317546 | pmc=2249748}}&lt;/ref&gt; However an early study by Paskind J. showed that laughter can lead to a decrease in skeletal muscle tone because the short intense muscle contractions caused by laughter are followed by longer periods of muscle relaxation. The cardiovascular benefits of laughter also seem to be just a figment of imagination as a study that was designed to test oxygen saturation levels produced by laughter, showed that even though laughter creates sporadic episodes of deep breathing, oxygen saturation levels are not affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fry | first1 = W. F. | last2 = Stoft | first2 = P. E. | year = 1971 | title = Mirth and oxygen saturation levels of peripheral blood | url = | journal = Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 76–84 | pmid = 5146348 | doi=10.1159/000286308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As humour is often used to ease tension, it might make sense that the same would be true for anxiety. A study by Yovetich N, Dale A, Hudak M. was designed to test the effects humour might have on relieving anxiety. The study subject were told that they would be given to an electric shock after a certain period of time. One group was exposed to humorous content, while the other was not. The anxiety levels were measured through self-report measures as well as the heart rate. Subjects which rated high on sense of humour reported less anxiety in both groups, while subjects which rated lower on sense of humour reported less anxiety in the group which was exposed to the humorous material. However, there was not a significant difference in the heart rate between the subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yovetich | first1 = N. A. | last2 = Dale | first2 = J. A. | last3 = Hudak | first3 = M. A. | year = 1990 | title = Benefits of humor in reduction of threat-induced anxiety | url = | journal = Psychological Reports | volume = 66 | issue = 1| pages = 51–58 | doi = 10.2466/pr0.1990.66.1.51 | pmid = 2326429 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the workplace ==

Humour is a ubiquitous, highly ingrained, and largely [[meaningful]] aspect of human experience and is therefore decidedly relevant in organisational contexts, such as the workplace.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Healthy humour: Using humour to cope at work|journal = Kōtuitui: New Zealand Journal of Social Sciences Online|date = 2009-01-01|issn = |pages = 89–102|volume = 4|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/1177083X.2009.9522446|first = Barbara|last = Plester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The significant role that [[laughter]] and [[fun]] play in organisational life has been seen as a [[sociological]] phenomenon and has increasingly been recognised as also creating a sense of involvement among workers.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Are we having fun yet? A consideration of workplace fun and engagement|journal = Employee Relations|date = 2009-10-02|issn = 0142-5455|pages = 556–568|volume = 31|issue = 6|doi = 10.1108/01425450910991721|last1 = Bolton|first1 = Sharon C.|last2 = Houlihan|first2 = Maeve}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sharing humour at work not only offers a relief from boredom, but can 
also build relationships, improve camaraderie between colleagues and 
create positive [[affect (psychology)|affect]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Humour in the workplace may also relieve tension and can be used as a [[Coping (psychology)|coping strategy]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;
In fact, one of the most agreed upon key impacts that workplace humour 
has on people’s well being, is the use of humour as a coping strategy to
aid in dealing with daily stresses, adversity or other difficult 
situations.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;
Sharing a laugh with a few colleagues may improve moods, which is 
pleasurable, and people perceive this as positively affecting their 
ability to cope.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;
Fun and enjoyment are critical in people's lives and the ability for 
colleagues to be able to laugh during work, through banter or other, 
promotes  harmony and a sense of cohesiveness.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Humour may also be used to offset negative feelings about a
workplace task or to mitigate the use of profanity, or other coping 
strategies, that may not be otherwise tolerated.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;
Not only can humour in the workplace assist with defusing negative 
emotions, but it may also be used as an outlet to discuss personal 
painful events, in a lighter context, thus ultimately reducing [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and allowing more happy, positive [[emotions]]  to surface.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;
Additionally, humour may be used as a tool to mitigate the 
authoritative tone by managers when giving directives to subordinates. 
Managers may use self-deprecating humour as a way to be perceived as 
more human and "real" by their employees.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Furthermore, [[ethnography]] studies, carried out in a variety of workplace settings, confirmed the importance of a fun space in the workplace.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;
The attachment to the notion of fun by contemporary companies has 
resulted in workplace management coming to recognise the potentially 
positive effects of "workplay" and realise that it does not necessarily 
undermine workers’ performance.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Laughter and [[Play (activity)|play]] can unleash [[creativity]], thus raising [[morale]],
so in the interest of encouraging employee consent to the rigours of 
the labour process, management often ignore, tolerate and even actively 
encourage playful practices, with the purpose of furthering 
organisational goals.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Essentially, fun in the workplace is no longer being seen as frivolous.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;
The most current approach of managed fun and laughter in the workplace 
originated in North America, where it has taken off to such a degree, 
that it has humour consultants flourishing, as some states have 
introduced an official "fun at work" day.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The results have carried claims of [[well-being]] benefits to workers, improved customer experiences and an increase in productivity that organisations can enjoy, as a result.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Others examined results of this movement while focusing around the science of happiness – concerned with [[mental health]], [[motivation]],
community building and national well-being – and drew attention to the 
ability to achieve "flow" through playfulness and stimulate "outside the
box" thinking.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Parallel to this movement is the "[[Positive psychology|positive]]" scholarship that has emerged in [[psychology]] which seeks to empirically theorise the optimisation of [[Human potential (disambiguation)|human potential]].&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;
This happiness movement suggests that investing in fun at the 
workplace, by allowing for laughter and play, will not only create [[enjoyment]] and a greater sense of well-being, but it will also enhance energy, performance and commitment in workers.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

== Studies ==
{{main|Humor research}}

=== Laughter ===

One of the main focuses of modern psychological humour theory and research is to establish and clarify the correlation between humour and laughter. The major empirical findings here are that [[laughter]] and humour do not always have a one-to-one association. While most previous theories assumed the connection between the two almost to the point of them being synonymous, psychology has been able to scientifically and empirically investigate the supposed connection, its implications, and significance.

In 2009, Diana Szameitat conducted a study to examine the differentiation of emotions in laughter. They hired actors and told them to laugh with one of four different emotional associations by using auto-induction, where they would focus exclusively on the internal emotion and not on the expression of laughter itself. They found an overall recognition rate of 44%, with joy correctly classified at 44%, tickle 45%, schadenfreude 37%, and taunt 50%.&lt;ref name="Szameitat2009"&gt;Szameitat, Diana P., et al. Differentiation of Emotions in Laughter at the Behavioural Level. 2009 Emotion 9 (3).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|399}} Their second experiment tested the behavioural recognition of laughter during an induced emotional state and they found that different laughter types did differ with respect to emotional dimensions.&lt;ref name="Szameitat2009" /&gt;{{rp|401–402}} In addition, the four emotional states displayed a full range of high and low sender arousal and valence.&lt;ref name="Szameitat2009" /&gt;{{rp|403}} This study showed that laughter can be correlated with both positive (joy and tickle) and negative (schadenfreude and taunt) emotions with varying degrees of arousal in the subject.

This brings into question the definition of humour, then. If it is to be defined by the cognitive processes which display laughter, then humour itself can encompass a variety of negative as well as positive emotions. However, if humour is limited to positive emotions and things which cause positive affect, it must be delimited from laughter and their relationship should be further defined.

=== Health ===

Humour has shown to be effective for increasing resilience in dealing with distress and also effective in undoing negative affects.

Madeljin Strick, Rob Holland, Rick van Baaren, and Ad van Knippenberg (2009) of Radboud University conducted a study that showed the distracting nature of a joke on bereaved individuals.&lt;ref name="Strick"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Strick | first1 = Madelijn | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = | title = Finding Comfort in a Joke: Consolatory Effects of Humor Through Cognitive Distraction | doi = 10.1037/a0015951 | journal = Emotion | volume = 9 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|574–578}} Subjects were presented with a wide range of negative pictures and sentences. Their findings showed that humorous therapy attenuated the negative emotions elicited after negative pictures and sentences were presented. In addition, the humour therapy was more effective in reducing negative affect as the degree of affect increased in intensity.&lt;ref name="Strick" /&gt;{{rp|575–576}} Humour was immediately effective in helping to deal with distress. The escapist nature of humour as a coping mechanism suggests that it is most useful in dealing with momentary stresses. Stronger negative stimuli requires a different therapeutic approach. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Humour is an underlying character trait associated with the positive emotions used in the [[broaden-and-build]] theory of cognitive development.

Studies, such as those testing the [[undoing (psychology)|undoing hypothesis]],&lt;ref name="Fredrickson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fredrickson | first1 = Barbara L. | year = | title = What Good Are Positive Emotions? | doi = 10.1037/1089-2680.2.3.300 | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 300–319 | pmid=21850154 | pmc=3156001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|313}} have shown several positive outcomes of humour as an underlying positive trait in amusement and playfulness. Several studies have shown that positive emotions can restore autonomic quiescence after negative affect. For example, Frederickson and Levinson showed that individuals who expressed [[Smile#Duchenne smile|Duchenne smiles]] during the negative arousal of a sad and troubling event recovered from the negative affect approximately 20% faster than individuals who didn’t smile.&lt;ref name="Fredrickson" /&gt;{{rp|314}}

Using humour judiciously can have a positive influence on cancer treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=22 January 2017|url=https://allusdoctors.com/cancer-treatment/humor-in-cancer|title=Humor in Cancer Treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humour can serve as a strong distancing mechanism in coping with adversity. In 1997 Kelter and Bonanno found that Duchenne laughter correlated with reduced awareness of distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keltner | first1 = D. | last2 = Bonanno | first2 = G.A. | year = 1997 | title = A study of laughter and dissociation: Distinct correlates of laughter and smiling during bereavement | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 687–702 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.4.687}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive emotion is able to loosen the grip of negative emotions on peoples’ thinking. A distancing of thought leads to a distancing of the unilateral responses people often have to negative arousal. In parallel with the distancing role plays in coping with distress, it supports the [[broaden and build]] theory that positive emotions lead to increased multilateral cognitive pathway and social resource building.

=== Ageing ===

Humour has been shown to improve and help the [[ageing]] process in three areas. The areas are improving physical health, improving social communications, and helping to achieve a sense of satisfaction in life.

Studies have shown that constant humour in the ageing process gives health benefits to individuals. Such benefits as higher [[self-esteem]], lower levels of [[clinical depression|depression]], [[anxiety]], and perceived [[stress (biological)|stress]], and a more positive self-concept as well as other health benefits which have been recorded and acknowledged through various studies.&lt;ref name="Abel, M. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abel | first1 = M | year = 2002 | title = Humor, stress, and coping strategies | url = | journal = International Journal of Humor Research | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 365–381 | doi=10.1515/humr.15.4.365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kupier | first1 = N.A. | last2 = Martin | first2 = R.A. | year = 1993 | title = Humor and self-concept | url = | journal = International Journal of Humor Research | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 251–270 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even patients with specific diseases have shown improvement with ageing using humour.&lt;ref name="Crew Solomon 1996 249–271"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crew Solomon|first=Jennifer|title=American Behavioral Scientist|journal=Humor and Aging Well: A Laughing Matter or a Matter of Laughing?|date=January 1996|volume=39|series=3|pages=249–271|doi=10.1177/0002764296039003004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall there is a strong correlation through constant humour in ageing and better health in the individuals.

Another way that research indicates that humour helps with the ageing process, is through helping the individual to create and maintain strong social relationship during transitory periods in their lives.&lt;ref name="Crew Solomon 1996 249–271" /&gt; One such example is when people are moved into [[nursing home]]s or other facilities of care. With this transition certain social interactions with friend and family may be limited forcing the individual to look else where for these social interactions. Humour has been shown to make transitions easier, as humour is shown reduce stress and facilitate socialisation and serves as a social bonding function.&lt;ref&gt;Shelley A. Crawford &amp; Nerina J. Caltabiano (2011): Promoting emotional well-being through the use of humour, The Journal of Positive Psychology: Dedicated to furthering research and promoting good practice, 6: 3, 237-252&lt;/ref&gt; Humour may also help the transition in helping the individual to maintain positive feelings towards those who are enforcing the changes in their lives. These new social interactions can be critical for these transitions in their lives and humour will help these new social interactions to take place making these transitions easier.

Humour can also help ageing individuals maintain a sense of satisfaction in their lives. Through the ageing process many changes will occur, such as losing the right to drive a car. This can cause a decrease in satisfaction in the lives of the individual. Humour helps to alleviate this decrease of satisfaction by allowing the humour to release stress and anxiety caused by changes in the individuals life.&lt;ref name="Crew Solomon 1996 249–271" /&gt; Laughing and humour can be a substitute for the decrease in satisfaction by allowing individuals to feel better about their situations by alleviating the stress.&lt;ref name="Abel, M. 2002" /&gt; This, in turn, can help them to maintain a sense of satisfaction towards their new and changing life style.

=== Physiology ===

In an article published in ''[[Nature Reviews Neuroscience]]'', it is reported that a study's results indicate that humour is rooted in the [[frontal lobe]] of the [[cerebral cortex]]. The study states, in part:&lt;blockquote style="text-indent: -0.5em; margin-top: -0.5em;"&gt;"Humour seems to engage a core network of cortical and subcortical structures, including temporo-occipito-parietal areas involved in detecting and resolving [[Theories of humor#Incongruous juxtaposition theory|incongruity]] (mismatch between expected and presented stimuli); and the [[Dopaminergic pathways|mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system]] and the [[amygdala]], key structures for [[Reward system|reward]] and [[salience (neuroscience)|salience]] processing."&lt;ref name="NeuroStudy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vrticka|first1=Pascal|last2=Black|first2=Jessica M.|last3=Reiss|first3=Allan L.|title=The neural basis of humour processing|journal=[[Nature Reviews Neuroscience]]|date=30 October 2013|volume=14|issue=12|pages=860–868|doi=10.1038/nrn3566|pmid=24169937|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Formula==
[[File:Cyklisci dk ubt.JPG|thumb|[[Surprise (emotion)|Surprise]] is a component of humour.]]
Humour can be verbal, visual, or physical. Non-verbal forms of communication–for example, music or visual art–can also be humorous.

===Root components===
* [[Observational comedy|Being reflective]] of or imitative of [[reality]]
* [[Surprise (emotion)|Surprise]]/[[Misdirection (magic)|misdirection]], [[contradiction]]/[[paradox]], [[ambiguity]].

===Behaviour, place and size===
[[File:Europe 2007 Disk 1 340.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Forced perspective]] used for comic effect in front of the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]]]]
[[Rowan Atkinson]] explains in his lecture in the documentary ''[[Funny Business (TV series)|Funny Business]]''&lt;ref&gt;Rowan Atkinson/David Hinton, ''Funny Business'' (tv series), Episode 1 - aired 22 November 1992, UK, Tiger Television Productions&lt;/ref&gt; that an object or a person can become funny in three ways:
* by behaving in an unusual way,
* by being in an unusual place,
* by being the wrong size.

Most [[sight gag]]s fit into one or more of these categories.

===Exaggeration===
{{Main article|Exaggeration}}
Some theoreticians of the comic consider exaggeration to be a universal comic device.&lt;ref&gt;Emil Draitser, ''Techniques of Satire'' (1994) p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; It may take different forms in different genres, but all rely on the fact that the easiest way to make things laughable is to exaggerate to the point of absurdity their salient traits.&lt;ref&gt;M. Eastman/W. Fry, ''Enjoyment of Laughter'' (2008) p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

Different cultures have different typical expectations of humour so comedy shows are not always successful when transplanted into another culture. For example,  a 2004 [[BBC News]] article discusses a stereotype among [[British humour|British comedians]] that Americans and Germans do not understand [[irony]], and therefore UK [[sitcom]]s are not appreciated by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3433375.stm|title=Do the Americans get irony?|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=27 January 2004|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In Search of The La's: A Secret Liverpool''''' is a biography about [[The La's]] written by M.W. Macefield, published in 2003 by Helter Skelter Publishing. The book gives a detailed history of the band with interviews from several ex-members and other persons related to the group. The author also discusses his own journey in tracking down each of the interviewees.

==Synopsis==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"With the timeless single "[[There She Goes (The La's song)|There She Goes]]", Lee Mavers' La's overtook [[The Stone Roses]] as great British guitar hopes and paved the way for the [[Britpop]] renaissance of [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]. However, since 1991, The La's have been silent, while rumors of studio-perfectionism, madness and drug addiction have abounded with Mavers lined up as another rock casualty. The author sets out to discover the truth behind Mavers' lost decade and eventually gains a revelatory audience with Mavers himself."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The author, MW Macefield, travels to [[Liverpool]] to interview several ex-members of the band (including co-founder [[Mike Badger]], guitarist [[Paul Hemmings]] and bass player [[John Power (singer-songwriter)|John Power]]), and sundry other personnel, and eventually gets to chat with the group's chief songwriter [[Lee Mavers]]. In it several La's myths are dispelled along the way, new song titles are named, and the past and future of the band is discussed.

[[File:Xihan Tomb 1 Jade Burial Suit.JPG|thumb|300px|Jade burial suit of Liu Sui, Prince of Liang, of Western Han, made with 2,008 pieces of jade]]
[[File:Si lü yu yi.JPG|thumb|300px|Jade burial suit at the [[Museum of the Mausoleum of the Nanyue King]], in [[Guangzhou]]]]

A '''jade burial suit''' ({{zh|c=玉衣|p=yù yī|l=jade suit}}) is a ceremonial suit made of pieces of [[jade]] in which royal members in [[Han dynasty]] China were buried.

==Structure==
Of the jade suits that have been found, the pieces of jade are mostly [[Square (geometry)|square]] or rectangular in shape, though triangular, trapezoid and rhomboid plaques have also been found.  Plaques are often joined by means of wire, threaded through small holes drilled near the corners of each piece.  The composition of the wire varies, and several suits have been found joined with either gold or silver.  Other suits, such as that of King [[Zhao Mo]], were joined using [[silk]] thread, or silk ribbon that overlapped the edges of the plaques. In some instances, additional pieces of jade have been found beneath the head covering, including shaped plaques to cover the eyes, and plugs to fit the ears and nose.

According to the ''[[Book of Later Han]]'', the type of wire used was dependent on the status of the person buried. The jade burial suits of emperors used gold thread; princes, princesses, dukes, and marquises, silver thread; sons or daughters of those given silver thread, [[copper]] thread; and lesser aristocrats, silk thread, with all others being forbidden to be buried in jade burial suits.  Examination of the known suits, such as the two found in [[Mancheng County|Mancheng]], has revealed that these rules were not always followed.  Considering the vast size of the country, and the relatively slow means of disseminating information, it is not surprising that the materials and techniques used in a jade burial suit occasionally differed from the official guidelines.

A jade burial suit was extremely expensive to create, and only [[wealth]]y aristocrats could afford to be buried in them.  Additionally, the process of manufacturing a suit was labor-intensive and is estimated to have required several years to complete a single suit.

==History==
[[File:Jade shroud for Liu Xiu (d. 55 BCE), King of Zhongshan.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Jade shroud for Liu Xiu (d. 55 BCE), King of Zhongshan in the National Museum of China, [[Beijing]]]]
Tombs from the [[Spring and Autumn period]] belonging to the dukes of the [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin state]] in [[Quwo]] were discovered in which the body was covered with small jade pieces once interwoven with silk.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aboluowang.com/news/2011/1112/225220.html&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, many archaeologists suspected that records of jade burial suits were only legends. The discovery in 1968 of two complete jade suits in the tombs of [[Liu Sheng, Prince of Zhongshan|Liu Sheng]] and [[Dou Wan]] in [[Mancheng County|Mancheng]], [[Hebei]], finally proved their existence. The jade suits of Liu Sheng and Dou Wan consisted of 2,498 plates of solid jade connected with two and a half pounds of gold wires.

In 1973, a jade burial suit belonging to Prince Huai of the [[Western Han Dynasty]] was discovered in [[Dingxian]], [[Hebei]]. It consisted of 1,203 pieces of jade and 2,580&amp;nbsp;grams of gold thread.&lt;ref&gt;“[[Dingzhou]]:The Story of an Unfortunate tomb.” Paul van Els. AS/EA LXIII•4•2009, S. pp. 909–941.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/e-gudai/4.htm China.org.cn]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, a jade suit was found in the tomb of [[Zhao Mo]], the second king of [[Southern Yue]], in [[Guangzhou]]. The red silk thread used to bind the 2,291 jade plates represented Zhao Mo's immersion into local culture. It is exhibited in the local [[Museum of the Mausoleum of the Nanyue King]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gdnet.gd.cei.gov.cn/gdnnet/todaygd/travel/4_html_e.htm Gdnet.gd.cei.gov.cn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040928021012/http://gdnet.gd.cei.gov.cn/gdnnet/todaygd/travel/4_html_e.htm |date=2004-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, a jade burial suit was excavated from a group of monumental tombs of the King of Chu, [[Liu Wu, Prince of Chu|Liu Wu]], in Xuzhou. This magnificent,  life-sized jade and gold burial suit is the finest to have survived, thereby possessing a high value for artistic appreciation. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.xz.gov.cn/ZGXZ_English/006/&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now believed that jade burial suits were actually relatively common among the wealthiest aristocrats of the Han Dynasty, but that over the years most have been lost due to the activities of [[grave robber]]s.

[[File:Punic gilded bronze cuirass AvL.JPG|thumb|Front of the Ksour Essef cuirass]]
The '''Ksour Essef cuirass''' is a [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] [[gilding|gilded]] [[bronze]] [[cuirass]] which was found at [[Ksour Essef]] in Tunisia. It is now kept in the [[Bardo National Museum]] in [[Tunis]].

== Description ==
The cuirass consists of two parts: a breast plate and a back plate. It is similar to the [[triple-disc cuirass]], of which it is a further development. On the breastplate, there are two discs which extend slightly from the surface of the breastplate in order to provide space for the muscles of the wearer's breast. The lower part of the plate is not the same as the triple disc cuirass, instead it depicts the helmeted head of [[Athena]]. The back plate is similarly shaped and the connecting plates are richly decorated too. On the discs, around the head and between them there are foliage and [[tendril]] motifs. The breastplate closed around the body with chains at the waist (supplemented by [[leather]] bands) and was secured over the shoulders by bronze [[hinge]]s.

== History ==
The breastplate was discovered in February 1909 in a grave in Ksour Essef in modern Tunisia, within the realm of ancient [[Carthage]]. It dates to the 3rd century BC. It was definitely not created in a Carthaginian workshop, but in a bronze smithy in [[Campania]] which was a centre for this sort of work in the third century. Perhaps a soldier of [[Hannibal]] acquired the armour as booty and willed that it be buried with him at his death - counter to common custom in Carthage at the time.

[[File:Virgin with Chancellor Rolin Luber.jpg|thumb|480px|''Madonna of Chancellor Rolin'', [[Oil painting|Oil]] on panel, c. 1435. 66cm x 62cm. [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris]]
The '''''Madonna of Chancellor Rolin''''' is an [[oil painting]] by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] master [[Jan van Eyck]], dating from around 1435.  It is kept in the [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris, and was commissioned by [[Nicolas Rolin]], aged 60,&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, 60&lt;/ref&gt; chancellor of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], whose [[votive portrait]] takes up the left side of the picture, for his parish church, ''Notre-Dame-du-Chastel'' in [[Autun]], where it remained until the church burnt down in 1793. After a period in [[Autun Cathedral]], it was moved to the Louvre in 1805.

==Description==
The scene depicts the [[Virgin Mary]] crowned by a hovering [[Angel]] while she presents the Infant [[Jesus]] to Rolin. It is set within a spacious [[loggia]] with a rich decoration of columns and bas-reliefs. In the background is a landscape with a city on a river, probably intended to be [[Autun]] in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], Rolin's hometown. A wide range of well detailed palaces, churches, an island, a towered bridge, hills and fields is portrayed, subject to a uniform light. Perhaps some of the Chancellor's many landholdings around Autun are included in the vista.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, p. 100–118&lt;/ref&gt;  A haze covers a mountain range in the far distance.  As in many [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s, the steepness of the hills and mountains is shown as much greater than that found locally, for dramatic effect.

[[File:Jan van Eyck 072.jpg|left|thumb|Detail of the angel.]]
The small garden with many flowers identifiable (including lilies, irises, paeonies and roses), visible just outside the columns, symbolizes Mary's virtues.  Beyond, two male figures wearing [[chaperon (headgear)|chaperons]] are looking through the [[crenellation]]s of what looks to be a fortified balcony or bridge.  There has been speculation that they may represent van Eyck and an assistant, after the pattern of his [[Arnolfini Portrait]].  The figure on the right wears a similar red chaperon to the probable van Eyck self-portrait in the [[National Gallery, London]].  Near to them are two peacocks, symbols both of immortality and of pride, to which even a powerful man as Rolin might succumb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/dossiers/detail_oal.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674055871&amp;CURRENT_LLV_OAL%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674055871&amp;bmUID=1182710990695&amp;bmLocale=en Louvre page, section "The garden"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713015628/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/dossiers/detail_oal.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674055871&amp;CURRENT_LLV_OAL%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674055871&amp;bmUID=1182710990695&amp;bmLocale=en |date=2009-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The interior has complex light sources, typical of van Eyck, with light coming both from the central portico and the side windows. The chancellor, whose strong character is well rendered by the artist, is wearing a fur-lined, elegant garment; the Virgin, the same size as Rolin (rather a novelty in comparison to the Gothic painting tradition), is instead covered by a red mantle. The Infant Jesus holds a cross in his left hand. The perfectionist rendering of details and textures, such as the capitals, the checquered pavement, the goldwork of the angel's crown or the garments is characteristic of Jan van Eyck's work, of which this is one of the finest examples.

As in other van Eycks, the depiction of the space is not as straightforward as it first appears.  Comparison of the floor-tiles with other elements shows that the figures are only about six feet from the columned loggia screen, and that Rolin might have to squeeze himself through the opening to get out that way.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  Many van Eycks show an interior space that is actually very small, but the depiction is subtly managed to retain a sense of intimacy, but without feeling constricted.

==Alterations==
[[File:Jan van Eyck 074.jpg|thumb|right|The carvings above Rolin.]]

[[Infrared]] reflectograms have disclosed a number of changes from the [[underdrawing]].  Rolin had a large purse hanging from his belt; since he had grown very rich in public office he probably felt that would be inappropriate.  The infant Christ was originally pointing at the floor.  Old descriptions from Autun tell us that the painting originally had a wooden frame painted illusionistically with inscriptions seemingly carved, like van Eyck's two portraits in London (''[[Léal Souvenir]]'' and ''[[Portrait of a Man in a Turban]]'').

==Iconography==
[[File:Madonna of Chancellor Rolin (detail).jpg|thumb|left|520px|Detail showing the church over Rolin's hands, and the cathedral over Christ, the flowers in the garden and the squashed rabbits of Lust.]] 
The Virgin sits with the infant Christ "on her knee" (i.e. on her thighs), which make a platform for the infant.  This very traditional motif is known as the ''[[Seat of Wisdom|Throne of Wisdom]]'', and was often used by Jan van Eyck, who elaborated the meaning in complex allusions.  The Virgin's body was often compared to an altar, on which Christ was present as he was believed to be during the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].  This painting may have originally hung to the left of Rolin's place at the front of his chapel in his parish church, between him and the altar.  To Rolin, or a viewer of the real and painted Rolins together, the Virgin is painted in the position of the altar in the chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[illuminated manuscript]] in front of Rolin is open to a page with a large initial D, which probably indicates "Domine, labia mea aperies" ("Lord, open my lips"), the opening of [[Matins]]; this is therefore a [[Book of Hours]].  

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden St Luke Some Chick MFA Boston.jpg|thumb|240px|right|[[Rogier van der Weyden]], as [[Luke the Evangelist|Saint Luke]], makes a drawing for his painting of the Virgin. The setting is clearly derived from the Rolin Madonna. ''[[Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin]]'', Boston, c. 1440.]]

The architecture of the loggia, as in so many of van Eyck's paintings, is in a rich and delicate Romanesque style far from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic styles]] of his own day.  The setting probably represents at the same time an imaginary building in Autun, and the "Heavenly city of Jerusalem"; two personages from two worlds are shown, and their surrounding combines the world of each.

The painting might be connected with the appointment in 1436 of [[Jean Rolin (cardinal)|Rolin's son Jean]] as [[Bishop of Autun]]; there is a magnificent [[cathedral]] on the Virgin's side of the river.  Also, just above Rolin's hands there is a smaller church, perhaps intended to represent a new church dedicated to the Virgin, or his own parish church, ''Notre-Dame-du-Chastel'' which he greatly enriched.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

There appears to be a series of illustrations of the [[Seven deadly sins]] distributed among the details of the painting. The [[relief]]s just over Rolin's head show (from left) ''the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Paradise'' ([[Pride]]), the ''Killing of Abel by Cain'' ([[Envy]]) and the ''Drunkenness of Noah'' ([[Gluttony]]).  Then the lion-heads on the capitals behind Rolin may stand for [[Anger]], and the tiny squashed rabbits between column and base in the loggia screen for [[Lust]] (which they were considered to exemplify in the Middle Ages).  All these details are on Rolin's side of the painting; no equivalents are visible on the other, divine, side.  However this leaves [[Avarice]] and [[Sloth (deadly sin)|Sloth]] unaccounted for, unless perhaps the human figures of Rolin himself (with his underdrawn purse), and the idlers out on the terrace (perhaps including, as stated above, van Eyck himself) represent the last two vices.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Melvin Miller Rader''' (8 November 1903 – 14 June 1981) was an author and professor of philosophy at the [[University of Washington]] for 51 years, and an outspoken advocate of civil rights. He taught [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]] and [[political philosophy]]. In 1948, he was accused of being a [[Communism|communist]] by the [[Canwell Committee]] (the Joint Legislative Fact Finding Committee on [[House Un-American Activities Committee|Un-American Activities]]), and was later exonerated in 1951 by [[List of Attorneys General of Washington|Attorney General, Smith Troy]]. [[Ed Guthman]], a [[The Seattle Times|Seattle Times]] investigative reporter, received a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his reporting of the events. In 2009, an endowment fund was created in Rader's name at the [[University of washington|University of Washington]] to fund philosophy students engaged in social justice work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phil.washington.edu/enews/fall2010/enewsfall2010rader.htm University of Washington, Philosophy Department, webpage.]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

'''''Mga Anak-Bukid''''' (literally "Children of the Farmlands", the title can be translated simply as "The Farmlanders") is a 1911 [[Tagalog-language]] novel written by Filipino novelist [[Rosauro C. Almario]]. Published by the Limbagang Cultura Filipina in [[Manila, Philippines|Manila]], Philippines, the novel narrates how the [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] who became the so-called ''[[pensioner|pensionado]]s'' undermined the traditional [[Filipino values|values]] and mores in the Philippines, including the people who acted as supporters and upholders of those conventional customs and norms.&lt;ref name=Vibal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vibalfoundation.org/?books=mga-anak-bukid|title=Mga Anak Bukid|accessdate=June 4, 2011|publisher=Vibal Foundation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316103052/http://www.vibalfoundation.org/?books=mga-anak-bukid|archivedate=March 16, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Mga Anak-Bukid'' is about the life of an ordinary farming couple, namely Tonyo and Juli.  They were supposed to get married, but on the day before the wedding ceremony, Juli was raped by the ''pensionado'' (literally "pensioner", someone receiving a salary or pension) named George, a Filipino representing the [[government of the United States]].  Through his job as a journalist, George criticized and attacked the traditional values and mores of the Filipinos in the Philippines.  Through his newspaper columns, George dismissed the long-established rituals and practices in the Philippines as laughable, old-fashioned, and as things that should remain only in the past.  In the meantime, Tonyo was still willing to marry Juli despite of the circumstances.  However, Juli was no longer enthusiastic in accepting Tonyo as her husband because her honor as a woman had been defiled.  Honor and [[virginity]] is important in traditional [[Filipino culture]].  Tony avenged himself and Juli by tricking George.  Unaware of the trap set by Tony and Juli, George agreed to meet with Juli.  When George went to the appointed place, he was slain by Tony.  Then Tonyo and Juli ran away into the mountains, both in agreement that there was no righteousness and hope for them if they stay in the lowlands.  The book is made up of 78 pages.&lt;ref name=Filipiniana&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filipiniana.net/publication/mga-anak-bukid/12791881583225|title=Mga Anak-Bukid by Almario, Rosauro|accessdate=June 4, 2011|publisher=Filipiniana.net|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219041730/http://www.filipiniana.net/publication/mga-anak-bukid/12791881583225|archivedate=February 19, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Migration Period art''' denotes the artwork of the [[Germanic peoples]] during the [[Migration period]] (ca. 300-900). It includes the '''Migration art''' of the Germanic tribes on the continent, as well the start of the [[Insular art]] or Hiberno-Saxon art of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] and Celtic fusion in the [[British Isles]]. It covers many different styles of art including the '''polychrome style''' and the [[animal style]]. After [[Christianization]], Migration Period art developed into various schools of Early [[Medieval art]] in Western Europe which are normally classified by region, such as [[Anglo-Saxon art]] and [[Carolingian art]], before the continent-wide styles of [[Romanesque art]] and finally [[Gothic art]] developed.

==Background==
[[File:Paar Prunkfibeln.jpg|thumb|Germanic ''[[Fibula_(brooch)|fibulae]]'', early 5th century]]
In the 3rd century, the [[Crisis of the 3rd Century|Roman Empire almost collapsed]] and its army was becoming increasingly [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] in make-up, so that in the 4th century when [[Huns]] pushed German tribes westward, they spilled across the Empire's borders and began to settle there. The [[Visigoths]] settled in Italy and then Spain, in the north the [[Franks]] settled into Gaul and western Germany, and in the 5th century the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]] invaded [[Roman Britain|Britain]]. By the close of the 6th century the [[Western Roman Empire]] was almost completely replaced with smaller less politically organized, but vigorous, [[Barbarian kingdoms|Germanic kingdoms]].

Although these kingdoms were never homogeneous, they shared certain common cultural features. They settled in their new lands and became farmers and fishermen. Archaeological evidence shows no tradition of monumental artwork, such as architecture or large sculpture in permanent materials, but a preference instead for "mobile" art for personal display, usually also with a practical function, such as weapons, horse harness, tools, and jewelry which fastened clothes.  The surviving art of the Germanic peoples is almost entirely personal adornment, portable, and before [[Germanic Christianity|conversion to Christianity]] was buried with its owner.  Much art in organic materials has no doubt not survived.

Three styles dominate Germanic art. The ''polychrome style'' originated with the [[Goths]] who had settled in the [[Black Sea]] area. The ''[[animal style]]'' was found in Scandinavia, north Germany and England. Finally there was [[Insular art]] or the ''Hiberno-Saxon style'', a brief but prosperous period after Christianization that saw the fusion of animal style, [[Celtic art|Celtic]], Mediterranean and other motifs and techniques.

During the 2nd century the Goths of southern [[Russia]] discovered a newfound taste for gold figurines and objects inlaid with precious stones. This style was borrowed from [[Scythians]] and the [[Sarmatians]], had some Greco-Roman influences, and was also popular with the Huns. Perhaps the most famous examples are found in the fourth-century [[Pietroasele treasure]] ([[Romania]]), which includes a great gold eagle [[brooch]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070114030307/http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/ujg/metalwork02.jpg picture]). The eagle motif derives from East Asia and results from the participation of the forebears of the Goths in the Hunnic Empire, as in the fourth-century Gothic polychrome eagle-head belt buckle ([https://web.archive.org/web/19991018233910/http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/ujg/metalwork12.jpg picture]) from South Russia.

The Goths carried this style to Italy, southern France and Spain. One well known example is the Ostrogothic eagle ([[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]]) from [[Cesena]], Italy, now at the museum in [[Nuremberg]]. Another is the Visigothic polychrome [[votive crown]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/19991010193109/http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/ujg/crown01.jpg picture]) of [[Recceswinth]], King of Toledo, found in a votive crown hoard of c. 670 at [[Fuente de Guarrazar]], near [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. The popularity of the style can be attested to by the discovery of a polychrome sword ([https://web.archive.org/web/19991014043050/http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/ujg/metalwork05.jpg picture]) in the tomb of Frankish king [[Childeric I]] (died ''ca'' 481), well north of the Alps.

===Animal style===
{{Main|Animal style}}
[[Image:Sutton.Hoo.PurseLid.RobRoy.jpg|thumb|Purse lid from [[Sutton Hoo]], c. 625]]
The study of Northern European, or "Germanic", zoomorphic decoration was pioneered by [[Bernhard Salin]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:sv:Bernhard Salin|Biography on swedish Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; in a work published in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;''Die altgermanische Thierornamentik'', Stockholm 1904, [http://openlibrary.org/works/OL4889930W/Die_altgermanische_Thierornamentik The Open Library online text], written in German and heavily illustrated.&lt;/ref&gt; He classified animal art of the period roughly from 400 to 900 into three phases: Styles I, II and III. The origins of these different phases are still the subject of considerable debate; the development of trends in late-Roman popular art in the provinces is one element, and the older traditions of nomadic Asiatic steppe peoples another.  The first two styles are found very widely across Europe in the art of the "barbarian" peoples of the Migration Period.

'''Style I'''. First appears in northwest Europe, it became a noticeable new style with the introduction of the [[chip carving]] technique applied to bronze and silver in the 5th century. It is characterized by animals whose bodies are divided into sections, and typically appear at the fringes of designs whose main emphasis is on abstract patterns.

'''Style II'''. After about 560-570 Style I was in decline and Salin's Style II began to replace it.  Style II's animals are whole beasts, but their bodies are elongated into "ribbons" which intertwined into symmetrical shapes with no pretence of naturalism, and rarely any legs, so that they tend to be described as serpents, although the heads often have characteristics of other types of animal. The animal becomes subsumed into ornamental patterns, typically using [[interlace (art)|interlace]]. Thus two bears are facing each other in perfect symmetry ("confronted"), forming the shape of a heart. Examples of Style II can be found on the gold purse lid.

After about 700 localised styles develop, and it is no longer very useful to talk of a general Germanic style.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yZVeZnUXMiAC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Salin+animal+style&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Dj2KTNGGEY_KjAfQp4GKBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Salin%20animal%20style&amp;f=false Rituals of power: from late antiquity to the early Middle Ages],  By Frans Theuws, Janet L. Nelson, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  Salin '''Style III''' is found mainly in Scandinavia, and may also be called [[Viking art]].

===Christian influence===
[[Byzantine enamel|Byzantine enameling]] highly influenced Migration period metalwork. The Church in the early Migration period emerged as the only supranational force in Europe after the collapse of the Roman Empire. It provided a unifying element and was the only institution left that could preserve selected rudiments of classical civilization. As the conversion of Germanic peoples by the end of the 7th centuries in western Europe neared completion, the church became the prime patron for art, commissioning [[illuminated manuscripts]] and other liturgical objects. The record shows a steady decline in Germanic forms and increasing Mediterranean influence. This process occurred quickly with the Goths of Italy and Spain and more slowly the further north one looked. This change can be observed in the 8th century [[Merovingian]] codex [[Gelasian Sacramentary]], it contained no Style II elements, instead showing Mediterranean examples of fish used to construct large letters at the start of chapters.

==Insular art==
{{Main|Insular art}}

Insular art, often also known as [[Hiberno-Saxon art]], especially in relation to [[illuminated manuscript]]s) was confined to Great Britain and Ireland and was the fusion of Germanic traditions (via the Anglo-Saxons) with Celtic traditions (via Irish monks). It can first be seen in the late 7th century and the style would continue in Britain for about 150 years until the Viking invasions of the 9th century (after which we see the emergence of [[Anglo-Saxon art]]), and in Ireland up until the 12th century (after which see [[Romanesque art]]).

===History===
[[File:Ireland 2010 etc 029 (2).jpg|thumb|[[Tara Brooch]], front view, early 8th century.]]
Ireland was converted to Christianity by missions from Britain and the continent, beginning in the mid-fifth century, while simultaneously pagan [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]] were settling in England. The extreme political fragmentation of Ireland and its total lack of urban development prevented the emergence of a strong episcopal structure. Monasticism consequently emerged as the dominant force in Irish Christianity, and thus in Irish Christian art.

[[Celtic Christianity]] also developed a strong emphasis on missionary activity. Around 563 [[Saint Columba]] founded a base on the Scottish island of [[Iona]], from which to convert [[Picts|Pictish]] pagans in [[Scotland]]; this monastic settlement became long remained a key centre of Christian culture in northern Britain. Columban monks then went to [[Northumbria]] in 635 and founded a monastery on the island of [[Lindisfarne]], from which to convert the north of England. However Rome had already begun the conversion of the [[Anglo-Saxons]] from the south with a mission to [[Kent]] in 597. Conflict arose between the Irish monks and Rome on the date to celebrate Easter, leading to withdrawal of the Irish mission from Lindisfarne to Iona. However, the widespread use of Irish decorative forms in art produced in England, and vice versa, attests to the continuing importance of interaction between the two cultures. England would come under increasing Mediterranean influence, but not before Irish Celtic and Anglo-Saxon art had profitably fused.

The first major work that can be called purely Hiberno-Saxon is the [[Book of Durrow]] in the late 7th century. There followed a golden age in metalworking, manuscripts and stone sculpture. In the 9th century the heyday of the Hiberno-Saxon style neared its end, with the disruptions of Viking raids and the increasing dominance of Mediterranean forms (see [[Anglo-Saxon art]]).

===Illuminated manuscripts===
[[Image:BookOfDurrowBeginMarkGospel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Book of Durrow]], 7th century Ireland. One of the earliest pieces of Hiberno-Saxon art. Trinity College Library, Dublin.]]
The surviving evidence of Irish [[Celtic art]] from the Iron Age period is dominated by metalwork in a [[La Tène style]].  [[Hanging bowl]]s such as those found at [[Sutton Hoo]] are among some of the most important of these crafts. As Irish missionaries began to spread the word of the Gospels they needed books, and almost from the start, they began to embellish their texts with artwork drawing from the designs of these metalworking traditions. The spirals and scrolls in the enlarged opening letters&amp;mdash;found in the earliest manuscripts such as the 7th century [[Cathach of St. Columba]] manuscript&amp;mdash;borrows in style directly from Celtic enamels and La Tène metalworking motifs.

After the Cathach of St. Columba, book decoration became increasingly more complex and new styles from other cultures were introduced. [[Carpet page]]s&amp;mdash;entire pages of ornamentation with no text&amp;mdash;were inserted, usually at the start of each Gospel. The geometric motifs and [[interlace (visual arts)|interlaced]] patterns may have been influences from [[Copts|Coptic]] Egypt or elsewhere in the Byzantine Middle East.  The increasing use of animal ornamentation was an Anglo-Saxon contribution of its animal style. All of these influences and traditions combined into what could be called a new Hiberno-Saxon style, with the [[Book of Durrow]] in the later 7th century being the first of its type. The [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] is another famous example.

The [[Book of Kells]] was probably created in Iona in the 8th century. When the monks fled to Ireland in the face of Viking raids in 807, they probably brought it with them to Kells in Ireland. It is the most richly decorated of the Hiberno-Saxon manuscripts and represents a large array of techniques and motifs created during the 8th century.

===Metalworking===
In the 7th century there emerged a resurgence of [[metalwork]]ing with new techniques such as gold [[filigree]] that allowed ever smaller and more detailed ornamentations, especially on the penannular and [[pseudo-penannular]] [[Celtic brooch]]es that were important symbols of status for the elite, and also worn by clergy as part of their [[vestment]]s. The [[Tara Brooch]] and [[Ardagh Hoard]] are among the most magnificent Insular examples, whilst the 7th century royal jewellery from the [[Sutton Hoo]] ship burial shows a Pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon style. They brought together all of the available skills of the [[goldsmith]] in one piece: ornamentation applied to a variety of techniques and materials, [[chip carving]], [[filigree]], [[cloisonné]] and [[rock crystal]].

===Stone sculpture===
{{Main|High cross}}
The skills displayed in metalworking can be seen in stone [[sculpture]]s. For many centuries it had been Irish custom to display a large wooden cross inside the monastic building enclosure. These were then translated into stone crosses called [[high cross]]es and covered with the same intricate patterns used by goldsmiths, and often figure sculptures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10174">'''Muddle Instead of Music: On the Opera ''Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District''''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Сумбур вместо музыки – Об опере «Леди Макбет Мценского уезда») is an [[editorial]] that appeared in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'' on January 28, 1936. The unsigned article condemned [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s popular [[opera]] ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'' as, among other labels, "[[Russian formalism|formalist]]," "[[bourgeois]]", "coarse" and "vulgar." Immediately after publication rumors began to circulate that [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] had written the opinion. While this is unlikely, it is almost certain that Stalin was aware of and agreed with the article.&lt;ref&gt;Moynahan, Brian. ''Leningrad: Siege and Symphony''. New York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2013, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; "Muddle Instead of Music" was a turning point in Shostakovich's career and factored into his public withdrawal of the [[Symphony No. 4 (Shostakovich)|Fourth Symphony]] some months later. The article has since become a well-known example of Soviet censorship of the arts.

==Background==

===Premiere of the opera and initial praise===
[[Leningrad]] composer Dmitri Shostakovich completed his opera ''Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District'' in 1932. Set in pre-[[Russian Revolution|revolutionary]] times, ''Lady Macbeth'' deals with themes of [[lust]], [[loneliness]] and [[murder]]. Some of its scenes are sexually explicit; a review in the ''[[The Sun (New York)|New York Sun]]'' called the opera "pornophony".&lt;ref&gt;Moynahan, pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 January 1934 the work premiered to great success, lauded by critics and government officials. ''Lady Macbeth'' quickly spread to [[opera house]]s worldwide, cementing Shostakovich's status as an international celebrity. In the [[Soviet Union]] it received instant praise. The newspaper ''Sovetskoe iskusstvo'' honored ''Lady Macbeth'' as "a triumph of musical theatre",&lt;ref&gt;Khentova, S. M. ''Shostakovich v Moskve''. Moscow, 1985, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Sovetskaya muzyka'' called it "the best Soviet work, the chef-d'oeuvre of Soviet creativity." &lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, Sheila. ''The Cultural Front: Power and Culture in Revolutionary Russia''. Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1992, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party]] officials were likewise pleased, extolling the opera and terming Shostakovich "a Soviet composer brought up in the best tradition of [[Soviet culture]]." &lt;ref&gt;Shostakovich, Dmitri. ''Shostakovich: About Himself and His Times'', compiled by L. Grigoryev and Y. Platek, trans. Angus and Neilian Roxburgh. Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1981, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 and 1935 the opera was performed several hundred times nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stalin's disapproval===

Almost exactly two years after the opera's premiere, Shostakovich was invited to a [[Bolshoi Theatre]] performance on 26 January 1936, where he found Stalin in attendance with several associates, among them [[Andrei Zhdanov]] and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]].&lt;ref&gt;Moynahan, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Nine days prior Stalin had attended another opera, [[Ivan Dzerzhinsky]]'s ''The Quiet Don'', and had praised it as a model of [[socialist realism]] for its lyrical clarity and emotional directness.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lady Macbeth'' did not make the same impression on the Soviet leader. Shostakovich later wrote to his friend [[Ivan Sollertinsky]] that he witnessed Stalin cringing at loud parts of the score and laughing at sexual moments. Displeased, Stalin left after the end of the third act. A frightened Shostakovich was reportedly "white as a sheet" when he bowed for the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Elizabeth. ''Shostakovich: A Life Remembered''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2006, pp. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later "Muddle Instead of Music" appeared on the third page of the 28 January issue of ''Pravda''.

==The article==

===Content===
"Muddle Instead of Music" begins by stressing the necessity of "good" popular music and its role in Soviet progress: "With the general cultural development of our country there grew also the necessity for good music…The people expect good songs, but also good instrumental works, and good operas." Shostakovich, it claims, failed to provide such work for an "appreciative audience." The piece calls ''Lady Macbeth'' "coarse, primitive and vulgar", a "cacophony" of "nervous, convulsive, and spasmodic music" that is little more than a "wilderness of musical chaos." Turning now to the composer himself, it admits that Shostakovich had talent but argues that he "deliberately" turned music "inside out", lamenting the lack of "simple and popular musical language accessible to all." It warns that such complexity endangers [[Soviet music]], leaving it vulnerable to "leftist distortion", "formalism" and "petty-bourgeois 'innovation.'" ''Lady Macbeth''{{'}}s success abroad was only further proof that it is an anti-Soviet opera that "tickles the perverted taste of the bourgeois." Perhaps the editorial's most dangerous pronouncement is that Shostakovich was not a class-conscious composer, rather an introspective artist who "ignored the demands of Soviet culture" and cared little for his audiences. Leaving no room for doubt about the depth of its deprecation, the editorial regrets that: "The power of good music to infect the masses has been sacrificed to a petty-bourgeois, 'formalist' attempt to create originality through cheap clowning. It is a game of clever ingenuity that may end very badly."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arnoldschalks.nl/tlte1sub1.html "Muddle Instead of Music"], ''Pravda'', 28 January 1936 (English translation)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===

The article immediately cast Shostakovich into disgrace. Performances of ''Lady Macbeth'' dwindled rapidly until the opera was completely banned. Those who had praised it before were compelled to retract their opinions. The composer lost most of his income and commissions. Many of his colleagues in the arts community sought to dissociate themselves from him, although some, such as [[Isaac Babel]], Abram Lezhnev and [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] spoke out in support of Shostakovich (all three would be shot in the purges).&lt;ref&gt;Moynahan, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shostakovich, half-finished with his [[Symphony No. 4 (Shostakovich)|Fourth Symphony]], was in [[Archangelsk]] on a concert tour when he read the article in ''Pravda''.&lt;ref&gt;Fay, Laurel. ''Shostakovich: A Life''. Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days later another scathing editorial appeared in the newspaper, this time about his [[ballet]] ''[[The Limpid Stream]]''. Named "Ballet Falsehood", the piece unleashed more castigation, calling the composer a musical [[charlatan]] and a peddler of "aesthetic formalism". The ballet's librettist, [[Adrian Piotrovsky]], was arrested and shot the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Katerina. ''Petersburg: Crucible of Cultural Revolution.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1995, pp. 291–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Though shaken by the attacks, Shostakovich continued writing his Fourth Symphony and completed it in April 1936. He booked a premiere for December and distributed the score to the [[St. Petersburg Philharmonic|Leningrad Philharmonic]] for rehearsals, which began in autumn.&lt;ref&gt;Moynahan, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; His friends expressed fear that the authorities would be angered by the work, which is influenced by [[Gustav Mahler]] (disliked by the Party) and is structurally unconventional.&lt;ref&gt;Muzykal'naia akademiia, 4 (1997), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Late in the year Shostakovich was summoned for a meeting with a representative of the [[Union of Soviet Composers]], who advised him to withdraw the symphony on threat of "administrative measures" for noncompliance.&lt;ref&gt;Moynahan, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The composer submitted to the demands and cancelled the premiere.

Shostakovich was formally [[political rehabilitation|rehabilitated]] with the premiere of his [[Symphony No. 5 (Shostakovich)|Fifth Symphony]] in November 1937. Encouraged by "Muddle Instead of Music" and other slander, he simplified his music to suit the prescriptions of [[socialist realism]]. The Fifth was an official success; Party members who had attacked him before acknowledged that he had "seen his errors" and improved.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
[[File:Andrei Zhdanov cutout.png|thumb|upright|Andrei Zhdanov]]
It is unknown who wrote "Muddle Instead of Music", as it was common for articles detailing an official Party stance to be published [[anonymity|anonymously]]. Scholars have speculated about the piece's authorship. Likely candidates include Zhdanov, at the time Leningrad's Communist Party manager and later Stalin's unofficial culture minister; [[David Zaslavsky]],&lt;ref name="Taruskin"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taruskin|first1=Richard|authorlink1=Richard Taruskin|title=Was Shostakovich a Martyr? Or Is That Just Fiction?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/arts/music/julian-barnes-the-noise-of-time-shostakovich.html?_r=0|accessdate=12 April 2017|work=The New York Times|date=26 August 2016|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of ''Pravda''{{'}}s senior writers; Boris Reznikov, another ''Pravda'' employee; and [[Platon Kerzhentsev]], a party official, playwright and journalist. Rumors spread that Stalin himself had written the article, although this is now thought to be unlikely. However, given Stalin's presence at the January 1936 performance and [[eyewitness testimony|eyewitness]] accounts of his dissatisfaction, it is reasonable to assume that he approved of, if not sanctioned, the article.

[[File:KM 5866 shedd aquarium august 2007.jpg|thumb|300px|Shedd Aquarium in the Museum Campus at dawn.]]
'''Museum Campus''' is a {{convert|57|acre|adj=on}} park in [[Chicago]] that sits alongside [[Lake Michigan]] in [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] and encompasses five of the city's most notable attractions: the [[Adler Planetarium]], [[United States|America's]] first planetarium; the [[Shedd Aquarium]]; the [[Field Museum of Natural History]]; [[Soldier Field]], home of the [[NFL]] [[Chicago Bears]] football team; and the Lakeside Center of [[McCormick Place]]. Museum Campus sits adjacent to [[Northerly Island]] along the waterfront.

==History==
[[File:Museum Campus, Chicago.jpg|thumb|250px|Pedestrian tunnel in the Museum Campus running underneath Lake Shore Drive]]The Museum Campus was created to transform the vicinity of three of the city's most notable museums – the [[Adler Planetarium]], the [[Shedd Aquarium]], and the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] – along with Soldier Field stadium, into a scenic [[pedestrian-friendly]] area. The area is landscaped with greenery and flora as well as jogging paths and walkways. A picturesque promenade along Solidarity Drive, an [[isthmus]], links [[Northerly Island]] to the mainland. The drive itself is lined with a number of grand [[Bronze sculpture|bronze monuments]] commemorating [[Thaddeus Kościuszko|Kościuszko]], [[Karel Havlíček Borovský|Havliček]], and [[Nicholas Copernicus]], the last of which is a replica of a famous 19th-century work in [[Warsaw]] by Danish sculptor [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The Museum Campus opened on June 4, 1998, when the northbound lanes of [[Lake Shore Drive]] were moved west of [[Soldier Field]] following the route of the expressway's southbound lanes. By removing the roadway which bisected the area, Museum Campus was created into a green space for the enjoyment of both residents and tourists.  In 2014, a consortium of museums in or near the [[University of Chicago]], formed Museum Campus South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitmuseumcampussouth.com/|title=Museum Campus South|author=|date=|website=Museum Campus South|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2014/07/24/south-side-museums-form-museum-campus-south/|title=South Side Museums Form "Museum Campus South"|author=|date=24 July 2014|website=cbslocal.com|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2014, filmmaker [[George Lucas]] selected Museum Campus as the location of the [[Lucas Museum of Narrative Art]], which would have cost an estimated $700 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sneed|first=Michael|title=Sneed Exclusive: Chicago to Get George Lucas Museum|url=http://politics.suntimes.com/article/chicago/sneed-exclusive-chicago-get-george-lucas-museum/tue-06242014-346pm-1|date=June 24, 2014|publisher=''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''|accessdate=June 24, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107035736/http://politics.suntimes.com/article/chicago/sneed-exclusive-chicago-get-george-lucas-museum/tue-06242014-346pm-1|archivedate=November 7, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded Museum Campus south along the city's waterfront. However, these plans were cancelled in June 2016 due to opposition from the Friends of the Parks advocacy group.

In August 2016, in a partnership with the City of Chicago, the Chicago Parks District and [http://ewfiber.com/ Everywhere Wireless], Museum Campus joined many [http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2015/august/mayor-emanuel--chicago-park-district-announce-expansion-of-free-.html Chicago Beaches] and [[Buckingham Fountain]] in providing free Wi-Fi to visitors.

In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, the Museum Campus was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Waldinger|first=Mike|title=The proud history of architecture in Illinois|url=https://springfieldbusinessjournal.com/2018/01/the-proud-history-of-architecture-in-illinois/|accessdate=30 January 2018|newspaper=Springfield Business Journal|date=January 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[American Institute of Architects]] Illinois component (AIA Illinois).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4698">The term '''natural mapping'''  comes from proper and natural arrangements for the relations between controls and their movements to the outcome from such action into the world.  The real function of natural mappings is to reduce the need for any information from a user’s memory to perform a task. This term is widely used in the areas of [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI) and [[interactive design]].&lt;ref name="DOETpage75"&gt;Norman, Donald A., "Knowledge in the Head and in the World". [[The Design of Everyday Things]]. New York: Basic Book, 1988. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mapping versus natural mapping ==

Mapping and natural mapping are very similar in that they are both used in relationship between controls and their movements and the result in the world. The only difference is that natural mapping provides users with properly organized controls for which users will immediately understand which control will perform which action.&lt;ref name="DOETpage75"/&gt;

'''A simple design principle:'''

{{cquote|If a design depends upon labels, it may be faulty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://citrusbits.com/user-stories-foundation-ui-design/ A Foundation For a perfect UI Design] by CitrusBits (March 20, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Labels are important and often necessary, but the appropriate use of natural mappings can minimize the need for them. Wherever labels seem necessary, consider another design.&lt;ref name="DOETpage78"&gt;Norman, Donald A., "Knowledge in the Head and in the World". [[The Design of Everyday Things]]. New York: Basic Book, 1988. 78&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Example of poor mapping and good mapping: kitchen stove ==

Consider, by way of example, the use of labelling on kitchen stoves with different arrangements of burners and controls.

=== Poor mapping: arbitrary arrangement of stove controls&lt;ref name="DOETpage77"&gt;Norman, Donald A., "Knowledge in the Head and in the World". [[The Design of Everyday Things]]. New York: Basic Book, 1988. 77&lt;/ref&gt; ===

[[Image:Old-style-kitchen-stove.jpg|thumb|none|300px|Kitchen stove with arbitrary controls in a row]]

In the above case, an arbitrary arrangement of controls, such as controls in a row, even though the burners are arranged in a rectangle, thereby visually frustrating the inexperienced user, leading to a period of experimenting with the controls to become familiar with the proper usage, and potential danger to the user.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cooper.com/insights/journal_of_design/articles/dont_get_burned_by_bad_mapping_1.html “Don’t Get Burned by Bad Mapping”] by Wayne Greenwood&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Good mapping: full natural mapping of controls and burners&lt;ref name="DOETpage77"/&gt; ===

[[Image:Stove-square.jpg|thumb|none|300px|Kitchen stove with full natural mapping of Controls]]

=== Issues with the Stove metaphor: Moving to a theoretical understanding of Mapping ===

In the stove metaphor there is an illustration of placement in relation to the controls; however, the effect of the control in relation to its operation is Heat as a result of Rotation.  Rotation does not naturally relate to heat, therefore the relationship is artificial, and a social construction. A better example would be the simple one of a privacy bolt on a toilet stall.  A simple slide bolt with a knob has a very direct mapping, whereas, one with a rotating lever requires the understanding of the transformation of the rotation translated into the movement of the bolt horizontally.  From this perspective, mapping is a characteristic of affordance. A deeper understanding of many our perceived 'natural' mapping relationships uncovers a predominately socially constructed, or cultural, underpinning.  Such as rotating a volume knob to make the music volume go 'up'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-49407-4_7 “Marshall McLuhan, Affordance, Mapping, and Human Computer Interaction in Interactive Media”] by Robert Wellington&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8714">'''New Contemporaries''' is an organisation in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] that works to support emerging artists at the beginning of their careers by introducing them to the visual arts sector and to the public through a variety of platforms, including an annual exhibition. Artists, whether still studying or having recently graduated, are given opportunities to make contacts and gain professional experience outside of their educational institutions. For the annual exhibition, artists are invited to submit a portfolio of work, from which a selection is made by a panel of judges. The selection is made by artists and writers, and often the selector will have previously been exhibited in a New Contemporaries show. 

Founded in 1949 as the "Young Contemporaries", the exhibition has run annually as a means to provide an impartial and democratic stepping stone from arts education to the professional art sector. Established hierarchies that might otherwise become set within the art school system are able to be assessed without bias through the anonymous selection process. 

Selectors have in the past included [[Ryan Gander]] (2013), [[Rosalind Nashashibi]] (2012), [[Pablo Bronstein]] (2011), [[Michael Landy]] (2007), [[Angus Fairhurst]] (2006), [[Jane and Louise Wilson]] (2005), [[Tacita Dean]] (2004), [[Rebecca Warren]] (2003), [[Sarah Lucas]] (2002), [[Chris Ofili]] (2001), [[Gavin Turk]] (2000) and [[Susan Hiller]] (1999). 

An annual exhibition for the final selection of New Contemporaries is staged in a leading UK arts venue; New Contemporaries has exhibited as part of the [[Liverpool Biennial]] since its launch in 1999. The importance of regional impartiality is recognised in the anonymity of the contributor's school, age, and nationality during the selection process and by the annual exhibition having no fixed location. A catalogue is printed to accompany the exhibition each year.

== Background ==

=== 1949–1970 ===
The first annual exhibition, initiated by [[Carel Weight]] for the British Society of Artists Galleries, was established in 1949 and known as 'Young Contemporaries'. In the foreword to the 1949 exhibition catalogue, [[Philip Hendy]], then Director of the National Gallery, wrote of his "hope that it is only the first of many. That it may grown into an annual event."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Phillip Bruton|title=Young contemporaries 1949|year=1949|publisher=Arts Council of Great Britain|location=London|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early exhibition gathered much critical and audience attention. Howard Hodgkin recollected that “the most memorable event at the opening of the first show was the speech made by Philip Hendy. With extraordinary generosity and frankness and somehow with a lot of sympathy as well, he compared what he felt to be the bleak but possible heroic fate awaiting us when we left Art School to the cosy, hierarchical life of an Art Historian.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodgkin|first=Howard|title=New Contemporaries Past and Present|year=1986|publisher=Arts Council of Great Britain|location=London|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1949 until 1969, the contributors were selected by artists and art specialists, but then in 1969 and 1970 students controlled selection themselves. Notable artists who participated in these early exhibitions include [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] (1958), [[Dorothy Mead]] (1959, the first woman president and later the first woman president of the London Group), [[David Hockney]] (1960), [[Patrick Caulfield]] (1961), [[Ray Atkins]] (1964), [[Robyn Denny]] (1964), [[Keith Milow]] (1967), [[Derek Jarman]] (1967) and [[Gerard Hemsworth]] (1967). Andrew Lambirth wrote in 1986 that “it wasn't until 1969 that the year that the colour cover of the catalogue looked like an Alpine Advertisement for poster paint – that the students decided to take over selection themselves. This controversial move was the logical if belated reaction to establishment colonization of the YC. Wasn't the whot supposed to be for the students, by the students?” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lambirth|first=Andrew|title=New Contemporaries Past and Present|year=1986|publisher=Arts Council of Great Britain|location=London|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1970 exhibition, held at the [[Royal Academy]], caused great controversy with one of the events nearly setting fire to the Royal Academy. Other sources claim funding was withdrawn because the organisation had dissolved into strife between college factions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lambirth|first=|title=New Contemporaries Past and Present|year=1986|publisher=|location=|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was not staged again until 1974.

=== 1974–1986 ===
In 1973, tutors from some London colleges - including Gillian Ayres, Paul Huxley and William Tucker – grouped together to restore the exhibition. They took a year to draw up a new constitution, arrange a willing venue, and organise the selection process. Taking place at the [[Camden Arts Centre]] in 1974, the exhibition was renamed New Contemporaries.

The Guardian reviewed the 1975 show as being “low on razzmatazz and high on endeavour”.  William Tucker wrote in the catalogue introduction that “the successful student these days is likely to be persuaded that is he an artist.  Nothing could be further from the truth. What the NC should do is enable students, for a moment at last as artists, to take public responsibility for what that have made – absolutely... This is not an exhibition of protest, but could become the opportunity for commitment. It is the harder role.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=William|title=New Contemporaries 1975|year=1975|publisher=Camden Arts Centre|location=London|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1978, the exhibition had an established exhibition venue in the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] (ICA) and a Permanent Committee supported the exhibition management until 1983. The selection of contributors was made by panels of students, divided between the specialisms of painting, sculpture, and performance/film.  However, the students soon began to realise that the current format for the exhibition was unsustainable, and many organisers were left with personal debt. In one interesting movement toward complete democratisation, the 1981 committee “in order to encourage a larger entry of works” asked for all submissions to be made in the form of slides and then created a slideshow that could be arranged at will “to give a more complete idea of what is going on in art colleges at the moment.” The final exhibition in this student-led format was staged in 1986 with a catalogue which contained a historical introduction (and post-script), to the exhibition by Andrew Lambirth, ''New Contemporaries Past and Present''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lambirth|first=|title=New Contemporaries Past and Present|year=1986|publisher=|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This essay also includes a number of published letters from previous contributors such as [[RB Kitaj]], [[Bert Irvin]], [[Michael Sandle]], [[Richard Wentworth (artist)|Richard Wentworth]], and [[Derek Jarman]]. Artists who participated in the exhibition during this period include [[Helen Chadwick]], [[Anish Kapoor]] (both 1977), [[Antony Gormley]] (1978), [[Mark Wallinger]] (1981), [[Peter Doig]] (1982), [[Dexter Dalwood]] (1983), and [[Catherine Yass]] (1984).

=== 1988–present ===
In 1987, the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] commissioned a feasibility report on New Contemporaries to look into the future viability of the exhibition. Published by Richard Shone, who has since become the Chair of a Volunteer Board of Directors, the report proposed a new structure and constitution for the organisation. For the first time, the exhibition was made independent from the art colleges, and supported by professional administration, inviting a panel of selectors each year to pick contributors. The exhibition was relaunched at the ICA in 1989 and toured to four regional centres. From 1989-1994, the exhibition was sponsored by [[British Telecom]] and since 2000 has been sponsored by [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]. In 1996, the exhibition was invited to become an component of the [[Liverpool Biennial|Liverpool Biennial of Contemporary Art]] and has since been staged in the city every two years. New Contemporaries is also supported by the [[Arts Council England]]. During this recent period participants have included [[Damien Hirst]], [[Glen Brown]] (both 1989) and [[Simon Starling]] (1994).

'''New Orleans Airlift''' is an artist-driven arts nonprofit, located in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. [http://www.neworleansairlift.org New Orleans Airlift] is dedicated to producing innovative projects for New Orleans-based artists to collaborate and engage with diverse communities locally and internationally. Airlift projects are identified by collaboration, experimentation and a belief in the artist’s role in creating a just, equitable and joyous future.

Airlift's programming highlights New Orleans’ underground art and experimental artists. Through networks, friendships, and close connections to New Orleans' street life, Airlift is able to cultivate and foster long-standing relationships with artists locally and globally. The organization understands how important a dynamic street culture, living culture and a thriving contemporary arts scene are to the neighborhoods within New Orleans. By transporting that which is unique to New Orleans to workshops, festivals, performances, and collaborative projects, Airlift is able to bring recognition to New Orleans as well as provide inspiration and creative collaboration around the globe.

__TOC__

==History==
 
Airlift was founded in 2008 by Delaney Martin and Jay Pennington. Pennington and Martin began to collaborate just after [[Hurricane Katrina]].  As they witnessed the particular devastation of the Storm on the New Orleans artistic community, Pennington and Martin saw collaborative creativity as a way of coming together and mending their community.

Together they organized an event called The New Orleans Airlift, which brought New Orleans artists to [[Berlin, Germany]] in 2009. Jay and Delaney named this project, thought to be a one-time-event, after the Berlin Airlift of WWII. Soon after returning from Berlin, though, Jay and Delaney decided to continue the cultivation of unique artistic collaborations, and kept the organization under the name New Orleans Airlift.

==Projects==
Airlift projects are hallmarked by creative collaboration, and artistic experimentation. One of the most successful projects to date has been [http://www.musicboxvillage.com The Music Box], a multi-disciplinary project dedicated to the exploration and performance of musical architecture. This project was inspired by the twin pillars of New Orleans culture, music and architecture.

From 2011 through 2012 the first ever installation of The Music Box called "A Shantytown Sound Laboratory"  presented groundbreaking musical performances and hosted free public hours in its inaugural location, the historic [[Bywater, New Orleans|Bywater]] neighborhood. Constructed from the remains of a blighted house, invented instruments were embedded into the walls, ceilings and floors of structures created by 25 collaborating artists. The Music Box captured the hearts of New Orleans community and the attention of international press including [[NPR]] who said: “High concept and nontraditional as it may be, The Music Box has found a place in the long history of New Orleans music."&lt;ref&gt;Powers, Ann. "A Night Out In New Orleans' New Bohemia." National Public Radio. NPR. Web. 28 Sept. 2015. https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2012/06/11/154776190/a-night-out-in-new-orleans-new-bohemia&lt;/ref&gt;

New Orleans Airlift continues to pair New Orleans artists with influential institutions, individuals and community members to collaborate to create artistic productions that are participatory, multifaceted and high quality. In the spring of 2015, New Orleans Airlift completed their installment of the Roving Village Residencies, an ambitious project where the musical houses travel to different neighborhoods around New Orleans. The first residency took place in City Park. Over the course of six weeks (April to May 2015) over 10,000 audience members explored the installation through night time orchestral concerts, free public hours on weekends, educational workshops and artist talks. Over 700 children participated in the Music Box Roving Village: City Park through school field trips and after school partnerships. The Village also hosted musicians from all musical backgrounds and locations such as Bruce “Sunpie” Barnes, [[Solange Knowles]], [[Wilco]], influential Jazz musicians [[William Parker (musician)|William Parker]] and [[Cooper-Moore|Cooper Moore]], Lost Bayou Ramblers, and [[Preservation Hall Jazz Band]], to name a few. Having proved to be a great success, a permanent Music Box Village and headquarters for New Orleans Airlift has been erected in the [[Bywater, New Orleans|Bywater]], neighborhood of New Orleans.

'''Organizational space''' describes the influence of the spatial environment on the [[health]], the [[mind]], and the [[behavior]] of humans in and around [[organizations]]. It is an area of scientific research in which [[interdisciplinarity]] is a central perspective. It draws from [[management]], [[organization]] and [[architecture]] (Dale and [[Gibson Burrell|Burrell]], 2008) added with knowledge from, for instance, [[environmental psychology]] (Evans and Mitchell, 1998), [[social medicine]] (Macintyre et al., 2002), or [[spatial science]] (Festinger et al., 1950). In essence, it may be regarded as a special field of expertise of [[organization studies]] and [[change management (people)|change management]] applied to architecture. The knowledge area is related to [[evidence-based design]] in which the influence of the spatial environment on patient's [[health]], [[healing]], and [[customer satisfaction]] are being researched in [[health care]]. It is also related to practice-based areas of management such as [[facility management]] which is primarily devoted to the maintenance and care of commercial or institutional buildings and to [[property management]] in which the operation of [[real estate]] is central. Sometimes it is also referred to as [[organizational architecture]]. The scientific field of organizational space must be distinguished from [[social architecture]] in which the development of [[information and communication technologies]] is central and also different from [[space science]] which is concerned with the study of the [[universe]].

== Spatial, physical and built environment ==
This research strand distinguishes three different [[Environment (systems)|environments]]: the spatial environment from the [[physical environment]] and the [[built environment]]. 
* Spatial environment: the total context in which [[human]]s in and around [[organization]]s function.
* Physical environment: all [[Tangible property|tangible]] physical [[Entity|entities]] in and around organizations.
* Built environment: that what is commonly understood as [[architecture]] and that what is permanently fixed to it.

== Organizational-spatial cycle of change ==
The coherence between the organization and its spatial environment may be regarded as an interwoven [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] cyclical [[flux]] from contingencies, intermediates, performances to interventions (Mobach, 2009). The [[Contingency theory|contingencies]] are the [[organizations|organizational]], [[architecture|architectural]], [[Technology|technological]], and [[Natural environment|natural]] conditions under which organization function. In the end they influence the performance of an organization, but first they mix in the [[Mediation (statistics)|intermediates]]. In this way humans in and around organizations will, for instance, notice these contingencies and will give them meaning (Clegg and Kornberger, 2006; Van Marrewijk and Yanow, 2010). Moreover, the contingencies will also influence [[social network|social contact]] (Becker, 1981; Steele, 1973) and the degree to which a spatial environment can be functional (Sharles, 1923). Subsequently, the intermediates influence different [[Performance management|performances]], for instance, the [[health]], the [[mind]], and the [[behavior]] of people in and around [[organizations]]. The spatial environment can cause [[illness]], such as with the [[sick building syndrome]] (EPA, 1991), but it can also positively influence the vitality of people or the recovery after an operation (Ulrich, 1984). The performances can provoke managerial intervention. In turn, these interventions will change the contingencies, and by doing so, change the elements, relations, and properties of the conditions under which people function.

'''Ormolu''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔr|m|əl|uː}} (from French ''or moulu'', signifying ground or pounded gold) is an English term, used since the 18th century for the [[gilding]] technique of applying finely ground, high-carat [[gold]]–[[mercury (element)|mercury]] [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]] to an object of [[bronze]], and for objects finished in this way.

The mercury is driven off in a [[kiln]] leaving behind a gold coating.  The French refer to this technique as "''bronze doré''"; in English, it is known as "'''gilt bronze'''".

==Process==
The manufacture of true ormolu employs a process known as mercury-gilding or [[fire-gilding]], in which a solution of [[Mercury(II) nitrate|mercuric nitrate]] is applied to a piece of [[copper]], [[brass]], or bronze; followed by the application of an [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]] of gold and mercury.  The item is then exposed to extreme heat until the mercury vaporizes and the gold remains, adhering to the metal object.

This process has generally been supplanted by the [[electroplating]] of gold over a [[nickel]] substrate, which is more economical and less dangerous.

==Health risk==
Due to exposure to the harmful mercury fumes, most gilders did not survive beyond 40 years of age. In literature there is a reference from [[John Webster]]:

{{quote|Hang him; a gilder that hath his brains perished with quicksilver is not more cold in the liver|''[[The White Devil]]''}}

After around 1830, legislation in France had outlawed the use of mercury, although it continued to be commonly employed until around 1900 and was still in use around 1960 in very few workshops. To replace ormolu, other gilding techniques (like electroplating from the mid-19th century on) were utilized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antiqueinstruments.co.uk/ormolu ''Ormolu, definition and origins'': in Antiqueinstruments] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811140333/http://antiqueinstruments.co.uk/ormolu |date=August 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=January 2018}} Electroplating is the most common modern technique.  Ormolu techniques are essentially the same as those used on [[silver]], to produce [[silver-gilt]] (also known as [[vermeil]]).

==Alternatives==
A later substitute of a mixture of metals resembling ormolu was developed in France and called ''pomponne'', though the mix of copper and [[zinc]], sometimes with an addition of [[tin]], is technically a type of brass. From the 19th century the term has been popularized to refer to gilt metal or imitation gold.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopédie méthodique&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilt-bronze is found from [[ancient history|antiquity]] onwards across Eurasia, and especially in [[Chinese art]], where it was always more common than silver-gilt, the opposite of Europe.

==Applications==
Craftsmen principally used ormolu for the decorative mountings of furniture, clocks, lighting devices, and [[porcelain]]. The great French furniture designers and [[Cabinet making|cabinetmakers]], or ''[[ébéniste]]s'', of the 18th and 19th centuries made maximum use of the exquisite gilt-bronze mounts produced by ''[[fondeurs-ciseleurs]]'' (founders and finishers) such as the renowned [[Jacques Caffieri]] (1678–1755), whose finished gilt-bronze pieces were almost as fine as jewelers' work. Ormolu mountings attained their highest artistic and technical development in France.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Similarly fine results could be achieved for lighting devices, such as chandeliers and candelabras, as well as for the ornamental metal mounts applied to clock cases and to ceramic pieces. In the hands of the Parisian ''marchands-merciers'', the precursors of decorators, ormolu or gilt-bronze sculptures were used for bright, non-oxidizing fireplace accessories or for Rococo or Neoclassical mantel-clocks or wall-mounted clock-cases – a specialty of [[Charles Cressent]] (1685–1768) – complemented by rock-crystal drops on gilt-bronze chandeliers and wall-lights.

The bronze mounts were cast by [[lost wax casting]], and then chiseled and [[Repoussé and chasing|chased]] to add detail. [[Rococo]] gilt bronze tends to be finely cast, lightly chiseled, and part-burnished. [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] gilt-bronze is often entirely chiseled and chased with extraordinary skill and delicacy to create finely varied surfaces.

The ormolu technique was extensively used in the [[French Empire mantel clock]]s, reaching its peak during this period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zaandam.klokkenmuseum.info/ Pier Van Leeuwen, ''Empire mantel clocks: A golden dream in timekeepers'' (2003): in the Museum of the Dutch Clock website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese and European porcelains mounted in gilt-bronze were luxury wares that heightened the impact of often-costly and ornamental ceramic pieces sometimes used for display.  Chinese ceramics with gilt-bronze mounts were produced under the guidance of the Parisian ''marchands-merciers'', for only they had access to the ceramics (often purchased in the Netherlands) and the ability to overleap the [[guild]] restrictions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} A few surviving pieces of 16th-century Chinese porcelain subsequently mounted in contemporary European silver-gilt, or ''[[vermeil]]'', show where the foundations of the later fashion lay.

From the late 1760s, [[Matthew Boulton]] (1728–1809) of Birmingham produced English ormolu vases and perfume-burners in the latest Neoclassical style. Though the venture never became a financial success, it produced the finest English ormolu. In the early 19th century fine English ormolu came from the workshops of [[Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy]] (1780–1854).

In France, the tradition of neoclassic ormolu to [[Pierre-Philippe Thomire]] (1751–1843) was continued by [[Lucien-François Feuchère]]. Beurdeley &amp; Cie. produced excellent ormolu in Rococo and Neoclassical styles in Paris, and rococo gilt-bronze is characteristic of the furniture of [[François Linke]].

'''Project Arts Centre''' is a multidisciplinary arts centre based in [[Temple Bar, Dublin]], which hosts visual arts, theatre, dance, music, and performance.&lt;ref name=e-flux&gt;{{cite web|last1=e-flux|title=Project Arts Centre|url=http://www.e-flux.com/client/project_arts_centre/|website=e-flux|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Playography Ireland"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Playography Ireland|title=PROJECT ARTS CENTRE|url=http://www.irishplayography.com/company.aspx?companyid=56|website=Playography Ireland|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

'''''Rumpelstiltskin''''' is a fairytale popularly associated with Germany (where he is known as '''''Rumpelstilzchen'''''). The tale was one collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]] in the 1812 edition of ''[[Children's and Household Tales]]''. According to researchers at [[Durham University]] and the [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa]], the story originated around 4,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BBC|title=Fairy tale origins thousands of years old, researchers say|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35358487|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|author=Sara Graça da Silva, Jamshid J.

==Plot==


In order to appear superior, a [[miller]] lies to the king, telling him that his daughter can [[Spinning (textiles)|spin]] straw into [[gold]] (some versions make the miller's daughter [[blond]]e and describe the "straw-into-gold" claim as a careless boast the miller makes about the way his daughter's straw-like blond hair takes on a gold-like lustre when sunshine strikes it). The king calls for the girl, shuts her in a tower room filled with straw and a [[spinning wheel]], and demands she spin the straw into gold by morning or he will [[Decapitation|cut off her head]] (other versions have the king threatening to lock her up in a dungeon forever). When she has given up all hope, an [[imp]]-like creature appears in the room and spins the straw into gold in return for her necklace (since he only comes to people seeking a deal/trade). When next morning the king takes the girl to a larger room filled with straw to repeat the feat, the imp once again spins, in return for the girl's ring. On the [[Rule of three (writing)|third]] day, when the girl has been taken to an even larger room filled with straw and told by the king that he will marry her if she can fill this room with gold or execute her if she cannot, the girl has nothing left with which to pay the strange creature. He extracts from her a promise that she will give him her firstborn child and so he spins the straw into gold a final time (In some versions, the imp appears and begins to turn the straw into gold, paying no heed to the girl's protests that she has nothing to pay him with; when he finishes the task, he states that the price is her first child, and the horrified girl objects because she never agreed to this arrangement).

The king keeps his promise to marry the miller's daughter. But when their first child is born, the imp returns to claim his payment: "Now give me what you promised." She offers him all the wealth she has to keep the child, but the imp has no interest in her riches. 

He finally consents to give up his claim to the child if she can guess his name within three days (some versions have the imp limiting the number of daily guesses to three and hence the total number of guesses allowed to a maximum of nine). 

Her many guesses fail, but before the final night, she wanders into the woods (in some versions, she sends a servant into the woods instead of going herself in order to keep the king's suspicions at bay), searching for him and comes across his remote mountain cottage and watches, unseen, as he hops about his fire and sings. In his song's lyrics, "tonight tonight, my plans I make, tomorrow tomorrow, the baby I take. The queen will never win the game, for Rumpelstiltskin is my name'", he reveals his name.

When the imp comes to the queen on the third day, after first feigning ignorance, she reveals his name, Rumpelstiltskin, and he loses his temper and their bargain. Versions vary about whether he accuses the devil or witches of having revealed his name to the queen. In the 1812 edition of the Brothers Grimm tales, Rumpelstiltskin then "ran away angrily, and never came back". The ending was revised in an 1857 edition to a more gruesome ending wherein Rumpelstiltskin "in his rage drove his right foot so far into the ground that it sank in up to his waist; then in a passion he seized the left foot with both hands and tore himself in two". Other versions have Rumpelstiltskin driving his right foot so far into the ground that he creates a chasm and falls into it, never to be seen again. In the oral version originally collected by the Brothers Grimm, Rumpelstiltskin flies out of the window on a cooking ladle.

==Name origins==
[[File:Rumpelstiltskin-Crane1886.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Illustration by Walter Crane from ''Household Stories by the Brothers Grimm'' (1886)]]

The name ''Rumpelstilzchen'' in [[German language|German]] means literally "little rattle stilt", a ''stilt'' being a post or pole that provides support for a structure. A ''rumpelstilt'' or ''rumpelstilz'' was consequently the name of a type of goblin, also called a ''pophart'' or ''poppart'', that makes noises by rattling posts and rapping on planks. The meaning is similar to ''rumpelgeist'' ("rattle ghost") or ''[[poltergeist]]'', a mischievous spirit that clatters and moves household objects. (Other related concepts are ''mummarts'' or ''[[boggart]]s'' and ''[[Hob (folklore)|hobs]]'', which are mischievous household spirits that disguise themselves.)  The ending ''-chen'' is a German diminutive cognate to English ''-kin''.

The earliest known mention of Rumpelstiltskin occurs in [[Johann Fischart]]'s ''Geschichtklitterung, or Gargantua'' of 1577 (a loose adaptation of [[François Rabelais|Rabelais']] ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'') which refers to an "amusement" for children, i.e. a children's game named "Rumpele stilt oder der Poppart".&lt;ref&gt;Wiktionary article on [[wikt:Rumpelstilzchen|''Rumpelstilzchen'']].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names used in translations==
[[File:The heart of oak books (1906) (14750176241).jpg|thumb|Illustration for the tale of "Rumpel-stilt-skin" from ''The heart of oak books'' (Boston 1910)]]

Translations of the original Grimm fairy tale (KHM 55) into various languages have generally substituted different names for the dwarf whose name is ''[[wikt:Rumpelstiltskin|Rumpelstilzchen]]''. For some languages, a name was chosen that comes close in sound to the German name: ''Rumpelstiltskin'' or ''Rumplestiltskin'' in English, ''Repelsteeltje'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''Rumpelstichen'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''Rumpelstinski'' or ''Rumpelestíjeles'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''Rumplcimprcampr'' or ''Rampelník'' in [[Czech language|Czech]]. In [[Japanese language|Japanese]] it is called  ルンペルシュティルツキン (''Runperushutirutsukin''). [[Russian language|Russian]] might have the most accomplished imitation of the German name with Румпельшти́льцхен (''Rumpelʹštílʹcxen'').

In other languages the name was translated in a poetic and approximate way. Thus ''Rumpelstilzchen'' is known as ''Päronskaft'' (literally "Pear-stalk") in [[Swedish language|Swedish]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bröderna Grimms sagovärld |last=Grimm |first=Jacob |last2=Grimm |first2=Wilhelm |publisher=Bonnier Carlsen |year=2008 |isbn=91-638-2435-3 |language=Swedish |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the sense of ''stilt'' or ''stalk'' of the second part is retained. Likewise, in [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], he is known as ''Rumleskaft'' (literally "Rumble-shank"). [[Italian language|Italian]] has ''Tremotino'' (which loosely means "Little Earthquake"). [[French language|French]] has&amp;nbsp;– besides other names&amp;nbsp;– ''Tracassin'' (like ''[[wikt:tracasser|tracasser]]'' "to pester"). In other translations an entirely different and generally meaningless name was selected, such as ''Barbichu'', ''Broumpristoche'', ''Grigrigredinmenufretin'', ''Outroupistache'' or ''Perlimpinpin'' in various translations to [[French language|French]]. [[Turkish language|Turkish]] translations use "Hariparibuşki Baripinpon" which does not mean anything and was chosen just because the name was complicated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

[[Slovak language|Slovak]] translations use ''Martinko Klingáč''. [[Polish language|Polish]] translations use ''Titelitury'' (or ''Rumpelsztyk'') and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ones ''Tittelintuure'', ''Rompanruoja'' or ''Hopskukkeli''. [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] ''Cvilidreta'' ("Whine-screamer"). For [[Hebrew]] the poet [[Avraham Shlonsky]] composed the name {{lang|he|עוץ לי גוץ לי}} (''Ootz-li Gootz-li'', a compact and rhymy touch to the original sentence and meaning of the story, "My adviser my midget"), when using the fairy tale as the basis of a children's [[musical theatre|musical]], now a classic among Hebrew children's plays. [[Greek language|Greek]] translations have used Ρουμπελστίλτσκιν (from the English) or Κουτσοκαλιγέρης (''Koutsokaliyéris'') which could figure as a Greek surname, formed with the particle κούτσο- (''koútso-'' "limping"), and is perhaps derived from the Hebrew name. [[Urdu]] versions of the tale used the name ''Tees Mar Khan'' for the imp.

===Television===
*In the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', Rumplestiltskin [sic] (also known as [[Mr. Gold]] and Detective Weaver) is played by [[Robert Carlyle]] and is one of the central characters, and is shown as a malevolent trickster who can spin straw into gold and enjoys making deals with those he comes across. Throughout the first seasons he concentrates on searching for his son, Baelfire. An expert on black magic and the dark arts (known as the [[Dark Lord (fiction)|Dark One]]), this man has wizardly powers to make him a fair match for anyone in the land, even the [[Queen (Snow White)|Evil Queen]]. In the course of the series, he is also revealed to have taken on the role of Cinderella's fairy 'godmother', and is also essentially the [[Beast (Disney)|Beast]], falling in love with Belle after he demanded her as a price for saving her kingdom from a war. In the season three episode ''[[Think Lovely Thoughts]]'', he is revealed to be the son of a man named Malcolm, who became [[Peter Pan]]. He also acts as the crocodile, cutting off Captain Hook's hand after killing Milah, the mother of Baelfire, who left him when he was still a powerless coward. Eventually, Belle banishes him from Storybrooke when his own nature turns against him, prompting him to ally with various other villains to try and ensure their own happy endings. He is briefly purified of his darkness when it is revealed that he is dying of the dark magic in his heart, but despite Emma attempting to help him become a hero while she takes on the Dark One role, he eventually reclaims his powers, and he goes way too far from being a beast. In the sixth season, Rumplestiltskin's mother is revealed to be the Black Fairy, who had abandoned him and Malcolm after choosing power over love. In the same season, he has a son with Belle named Gideon. In season 7 he is on a quest to find the Guardian to rid him of his dark powers so he can be reunited with Belle. He gains the help of Alice. In the final episode, Rumplestiltskin sacrifices himself to defeat his evil Wish Realm counterpart and save Hook (who had a cursed heart) by giving Hook his heart, causing his Wish Realm counterpart to die too. Afterwards, Rumplestiltskin is reunited with Belle in the afterlife.
*Rumpelstiltskin appears in ''[[Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child]]'' voiced by [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]].
*Rumpelstiltskin was featured in NBC's ''[[Grimm (TV series)|Grimm]]'', where the tale is the inspiration for the Season 2 episode "Nameless". He is a type of creature ('Wesen') called a 'Fuchsteufelwild'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roots |first=Kimberly |url=http://tvline.com/2013/03/26/grimm-season-2-spoilers-rumplestiltskin-nicks-book/ |title=Grimm Season 2 Spoilers — Rumplestiltskin Pages from Nick’s Books |publisher=TVLine |date=2013-03-26 |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode featured a Fuchsteufelwild named "Trinket Lipslums" (an anagram of "Rumpelstiltskin"), who is revealed to have helped a team of video game programmers finish an enormously popular [[MMORPG]]. The programmers omitted him from the game's credits since they could not recall his name, so Lipslums starts hunting them down one by one; as in the original tale, much of the story centers around determining the character's name.
*In an episode of the TV show ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' titled "[[If Wishes Were Horses]]", [[Miles O'Brien (Star Trek)|Miles O'Brien]] reads his daughter the story of Rumpelstiltskin at bedtime and then leaves her room.  She comes out shortly afterward to inform her father that Rumpelstiltskin is in the room with her.

The '''Russian avant-garde''' was a large, influential wave of [[avant-garde]] [[modern art]] that flourished in the [[Russian Empire]] and [[Soviet Union]], approximately from 1890 to 1930—although some have placed its beginning as early as 1850 and its end as late as 1960. The term covers many separate, but inextricably related, [[art movement]]s that flourished at the time; namely [[Suprematism]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Russian Futurism]], [[Cubo-Futurism]], [[Zaum]] and [[Neo-primitivism]]. Given that many avant-garde artists involved were born or grew up in what is present day [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]] (including [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Aleksandra Ekster]], [[Vladimir Tatlin]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[David Burliuk]], [[Alexander Archipenko]]), some sources also talk about [[Ukrainian avant-garde]], etc.

The Russian avant-garde reached its creative and popular height in the period between the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and 1932, at which point the ideas of the avant-garde clashed with the newly emerged state-sponsored direction of [[Socialist Realism]].

The '''sock''' and '''buskin''' are two ancient symbols of [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]]. In Greek theatre, actors in tragic roles wore a boot called a [[buskin]] (Latin ''cothurnus'') that elevated them above the other actors. The actors with comedic roles only wore a thin soled shoe called a [[Soccus|sock]] (Latin ''soccus'').

[[Melpomene]], the muse of tragedy, is often depicted holding the tragic mask and wearing buskins. [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]], the muse of comedy, is similarly associated with the mask of comedy and comic’s socks. Some people refer to the masks themselves as "Sock and Buskin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Mackay|title=A Glossary of Obscure Words and Phrases in the Writings of Shakspeare and His Contemporaries Traced Etymologically to the Ancient Language of the British People as Spoken Before the Irruption of the Danes and Saxons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wKXTAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA48|year=1887|publisher=S.

The '''4th Symphony "Martín y Soler"''' of [[Claudio Prieto]] was composed in 2006 as a commission from the [[Orquesta de Valencia]], which premiered it on February 23, 2007 with [[Antoni Ros-Marbà]] conducting the ensemble. 

The Symphony is made up of a single 50' long movement and was composed as a tribute to Valencian composer [[Vicente Martín y Soler]], evoking his time's aesthetic while raising Prieto's personal view of the projection of his figure, both in artistic and biographic terms.

'''''The Lunch''''' is a very early painting by Spanish artist [[Diego Velázquez]], finished c. 1617. The work, an oil painting on canvas, is in the [[Hermitage Museum]] of [[Saint Petersburg]].

The painting portrays a table covered by a creased cloth, on which lie two [[pomegranate]]s and a piece of bread. People attending the lunch include an aged man on the left and a young man on the right, while, in the background, an apparently carefree boy pours wine into a  jug.

On the wall in the background hang a white neck-band, a leather bag and, on the right, a sword.

''The Lunch'' is nearly identical to another painting by Velázquez, ''[[The Farmers' Lunch]]'' (1618).

'''Turkish art''' refers to all works of [[visual art]] originating from the geographical area of what is present day [[Turkey]] since the arrival of the [[Turkish people|Turks]] in the Middle Ages.  Turkey also was the home of much significant art produced by earlier cultures, including the [[Hittites]], [[Ancient Greeks]], and [[Byzantine art|Byzantines]].  '''Ottoman art''' is therefore to the dominant element of Turkish art before the 20th century, although the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuks]] and other [[Turkic migration|earlier Turks]] also contributed.  The 16th and 17th centuries are generally recognized as the finest period for art in the [[Ottoman Empire]], much of it associated with the huge Imperial court.  In particular the long reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] from 1520–1566 brought a combination, rare in any ruling dynasty, of political and military success with strong encouragement of the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 12; Rogers and Ward, throughout, especially 26-41&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''nakkashane'', as the palace workshops are now generally known, were evidently very important and productive, but though there is a fair amount of surviving documentation, much remains unclear about how they operated.  They operated over many different media, but apparently not including pottery or textiles, with the craftsmen or artists apparently a mixture of slaves, especially Persians, captured in war (at least in the early periods), trained Turks, and foreign specialists. They were not necessarily physically located in the palace, and may have been able to undertake work for other clients as well as the sultan.  Many specialities were passed from father to son.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers and Ward, 120-124; 186-188&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art media==
{{Culture of Turkey}}
[[Ottoman architecture]] developed traditional [[Islamic architecture|Islamic styles]], with some technical influences from Europe, into a highly sophisticated style, with interiors richly decorated in coloured tiles, seen in palaces, mosques and [[Türbe|turbe]] mausolea.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of art represented developments of earlier [[Islamic art]], especially [[Persian art|those of Persia]], but with a distinct Turkish character. As in Persia, [[Chinese porcelain]] was avidly collected by the Ottoman court, and represented another important influence, mainly on decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 54, 60; Rogers and Ward, 29, 186; Rawson, 183-191, and see index&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ottoman miniature]] and [[Ottoman illumination]] cover the figurative and non-figurative elements of the decoration of manuscripts, which tend to be treated as distinct genres, though often united in the same manuscript and page.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, see index; Rogers and Ward, 59-119&lt;/ref&gt;

The reign of the Ottomans in the 16th and early 17th centuries introduced the Turkish form of [[Islamic calligraphy]]. This art form reached the height of its popularity during the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] (1520&amp;ndash;66).&lt;ref&gt;Rogers and Ward, 55-74&lt;/ref&gt;  As decorative as it was communicative, [[Diwani]] was distinguished by the complexity of the line within the letter and the close juxtaposition of the letters within the word. The [[hilya]] is an illuminated sheet with Islamic calligraphy of a description of the Prophet [[Muhammad]].  The [[tughra]] is an elaborately stylized formal signature of the sultan, which like the hilya performed some of the functions of portraits in Christian Europe.  Bookcovers were also elaborately decorated.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, see index; Rogers and Ward, 26-41, 62-64 on tughra&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important media were in the applied or [[decorative arts]] rather than figurative work.  Pottery, especially [[İznik pottery]], jewellery, [[hardstone carving]]s, [[Turkish carpet]]s, woven and embroidered silk textiles were all produced to extremely high standards, and carpets in particular were exported widely.  Other Turkish art ranges from metalwork, carved woodwork and furniture with elaborate inlays to traditional ''Ebru'' or [[paper marbling]].&lt;ref&gt;Rogers and Ward, 120-215, cover a wide range; Levey, 51-55, and see index&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later periods==
In the 18th and 19th centuries Turkish art and architecture became more heavily influenced by contemporary European styles, leading to over-elaborated and fussy detail in decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, chapters 5 and 6&lt;/ref&gt;  European-style painting was slow to be adopted, with [[Osman Hamdi Bey]] (1842-1910) for long a somewhat solitary figure. He was a member of the Ottoman administrative elite who trained in Paris, and painted throughout his long career as a senior administrator and curator in Turkey. Many of his works represent [[Orientalism]] from the inside, as it were.

A transition from Islamic artistic traditions under the Ottoman Empire to a more secular, Western orientation has taken place in Turkey. [[History of Modern Turkish painting|Modern Turkish painters]] are striving to find their own art forms, free from Western influence. Sculpture is less developed, and public monuments are usually heroic representations of [[Atatürk]] and events from the war of independence. Literature is considered the most advanced of contemporary Turkish arts.

[[File:Baldung Hexen 1508 kol.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|''Witches'' by [[Hans Baldung]]. Woodcut, 1508]]
'''Witchcraft''' or '''witchery''' broadly means the practice of and belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] skills and abilities exercised by solitary practitioners and groups. ''Witchcraft'' is a broad term that varies culturally and societally, and thus can be difficult to define with precision,&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=LsjagvvkveEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=witchcraft+definition&amp;ots=aw4oz13kOS&amp;sig=2CWBjLB2TIsUt1aNz_nyUPxOf5E&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=witchcraft%20definition&amp;f=false Witchcraft in the Middle Ages], Jeffrey Russell, p.4-10.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cross-cultural]] assumptions about the meaning or significance of the term should be applied with caution. Witchcraft often occupies a religious [[divination|divinatory]] or medicinal role,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and is often present within societies and groups whose [[cultural framework]] includes a magical [[world view]].&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

==Concept==
[[File:John William Waterhouse - Magic Circle.JPG|thumb|upright|''[[The Magic Circle (Waterhouse painting)|The Magic Circle]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]], 1886]]

The concept of witchcraft and the belief in its existence have persisted throughout recorded history. They have been present or central at various times and in many diverse forms among cultures and religions worldwide, including both "primitive" and "highly advanced" cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Bengt Ankarloo &amp; Stuart Clark, Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Biblical and Pagan Societies", University of Philadelphia Press, 2001, p xiii: ''"Magic is central not only in 'primitive' societies but in 'high cultural' societies as well"''&lt;/ref&gt; and continue to have an important role in many cultures today.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bengt Ankarloo &amp; Stuart Clark, Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Biblical and Pagan Societies", University of Philadelphia Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Scientifically, the existence of magical powers and witchcraft are generally believed to [[pseudoscience|lack credence]] and to be unsupported by high-quality [[scientific method|experimental testing]], although individual witchcraft practices [[Medical explanations of bewitchment|and effects]] may be open to [[scientific knowledge|scientific explanation]] or explained via [[mentalism]] and [[Psychological theories of magic|psychology]].

Historically, the [[Christian views on magic|predominant concept of witchcraft in the Western world]] derives from [[Old Testament]] [[biblical law|laws]] against witchcraft, and entered the mainstream when belief in witchcraft gained Church approval in the [[Early Modern Period]]. It posits a [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophical]] [[conflict between good and evil]], where witchcraft was generally [[evil]] and often associated with [[Devil in Christianity|the Devil]] and [[Devil worship]]. This culminated in deaths, [[torture]] and [[scapegoating]] (casting blame for human misfortune),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeffrey Burton Russell |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/646051/witchcraft |title=Witchcraft – Encyclopædia Britannica |website=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999, pp. 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt; and many years of large scale [[Witch trials in the early modern period|witch-trials]] and [[witch-hunting|witch hunts]], especially in [[Protestant]] Europe, before largely ceasing during the European [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Christian views in the modern day are diverse and cover the gamut of views from intense belief and opposition (especially from Christian [[fundamentalist]]s) to non-belief, and in some churches even approval. From the mid-20th century, witchcraft – sometimes called contemporary witchcraft to clearly distinguish it from older beliefs – became the name of a branch of [[modern paganism]].  It is most notably practiced in the [[Wiccan]] and modern witchcraft traditions, and no longer practices in secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margot Adler|Adler, Margot]] (1979) ''Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today''.

The Western mainstream Christian view is far from the only societal perspective about witchcraft. Many cultures worldwide continue to have widespread practices and cultural beliefs that are loosely translated into English as "witchcraft", although the English translation masks a very great diversity in their forms, magical beliefs, practices, and place in their societies. During the [[History of colonialism|Age of Colonialism]], many cultures across the globe were exposed to the modern Western world via [[colonialism]], usually accompanied and often preceded by intensive [[Christianity and colonialism|Christian missionary activity]] ''(see "[[Christianization#Colonial era (16th−19th centuries)|Christianization]]")''. Beliefs related to witchcraft and magic in these cultures were at times influenced by the prevailing Western concepts. Witch hunts, scapegoating, and killing or shunning of suspected witches still occurs in the modern era,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pearlman |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/papuanewguinea/9987294/Papua-New-Guinea-urged-to-halt-witchcraft-violence-after-latest-sorcery-case.html |title=Papua New Guinea urged to halt witchcraft violence after latest 'sorcery' case |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2013-04-11 |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; with killings both of victims [[Murder for body parts#Medicine murder|for their supposedly magical body parts]], and of suspected witchcraft practitioners.

== Etymology and definitions ==
{{Further information|Witch (word)}}
The word ''witch'' is of uncertain origin. There are numerous etymologies that it could be derived from. One popular belief is that it is "related to the English words wit, wise, wisdom [Germanic root *weit-, *wait-, *wit-; Indo-European root *weid-, *woid-, *wid-]," so "craft of the wise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/12416396|title=Power in the Name: The Origin and Meaning of the Word &amp;quot;Witch&amp;quot;|first=Michael|last=Dilts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another is from the [[Old English]] wiccecræft, a compound of "wicce" ("witch") and "cræft" ("craft").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper |first=Douglas|title=witchcraft (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=witchcraft&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[anthropology|anthropological]] terminology, witches differ from sorcerers in that they don't use physical tools or actions to curse; their [[maleficium (sorcery)|maleficium]] is perceived as extending from some intangible inner quality, and one may be unaware of  being a witch, or may have been convinced of his/her nature by the suggestion of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohn |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Cohn |title=Europe's Inner Demons |pages=176–9 |date=1975 |isbn=978-0-465-02131-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition was pioneered in a study of central African magical beliefs by [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]], who cautioned that it might not correspond with normal English usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans-Pritchard |first=Edward Evan |title=Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Among the Azande |date=1937 |pages=8–9 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-874029-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians of European witchcraft have found the anthropological definition difficult to apply to European witchcraft, where witches could equally use (or be accused of using) physical techniques, as well as some who really had attempted to cause harm by thought alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Keith |authorlink=Keith Thomas (historian) |date=1997 |title=Religion and the Decline of Magic |pages=464–5 |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-297-00220-8}}; Ankarloo, Bengt and Henningsen, Gustav (1990) ''Early Modern European Witchcraft: Centres and Peripheries''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 1, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; European witchcraft is seen by historians and anthropologists as an [[ideology]] for explaining misfortune; however, this ideology has manifested in diverse ways, as described below.&lt;ref name="Pocs"&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 9–10. The first three categories were proposed by [[Richard Kieckhefer]], the fourth added by Christina Larner.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

=== Alleged practices ===
[[File:A Witch.jpg|thumb|''A Witch'', 1902, by [[Edward Robert Hughes]]]]
Historically the witchcraft label has been applied to practices people believe influence the mind, body, or property of others against their will—or practices that the person doing the labeling believes undermine social or religious order. Some modern commentators{{who|date=April 2011}} believe the malefic nature of witchcraft is a Christian projection. The concept of a magic-worker influencing another person's body or property against their will was clearly present in many cultures, as traditions in both folk magic and religious magic have the purpose of countering malicious magic or identifying malicious magic users. Many examples appear in early texts, such as those from [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Babylonia]]. Malicious magic users can become a credible cause for disease, sickness in animals, bad luck, sudden death, impotence and other such misfortunes. Witchcraft of a more benign and socially acceptable sort may then be employed to turn the malevolence aside, or identify the supposed evil-doer so that punishment may be carried out. The folk magic used to identify or protect against malicious magic users is often indistinguishable from that used by the witches themselves.

{{quote|It is argued here that the medical arts played a significant and sometimes pivotal role in the witchcraft controversies of seventeenth century New England. Not only were physicians and surgeons the principal professional arbiters for determining natural versus preternatural signs and symptoms of disease, they occupied key legislative, judicial, and ministerial roles relating to witchcraft proceedings. Forty six male physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries are named in court transcripts or other contemporary source materials relating to New England witchcraft. These practitioners served on coroners' inquests, performed autopsies, took testimony, issued writs, wrote letters, or committed people to prison, in addition to diagnosing and treating patients. Some practitioners are simply mentioned in passing.&lt;ref&gt;Gevitz, N. ""The Devil Hath Laughed at the Physicians": Witchcraft and Medical Practice in Seventeenth-Century New England." Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences, vol. 55 no. 1, 2000, pp. 5–36. Project MUSE, muse.jhu.edu/article/15172.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There has also existed in popular belief the concept of [[white witch]]es and white witchcraft, which is strictly benevolent. Many neopagan witches strongly identify with this concept, and profess [[ethical code]]s that prevent them from performing magic on a person without their request.

Where belief in malicious magic practices exists, such practitioners are typically forbidden by law as well as hated and feared by the general populace, while beneficial magic is tolerated or even accepted wholesale by the people&amp;nbsp;– even if the orthodox establishment opposes it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QqPbJQkSo8EC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=alleged+practices+witchcraft#v=onepage&amp;q=alleged%20practices%20witchcraft&amp;f=false|title=Witches, Druids and King Arthur|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|date=2006-09-15|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781852855550|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spell casting ====
{{See also|Magic (paranormal)}}

Probably the most widely known characteristic of a witch was the ability to cast a [[spell (paranormal)|spell]], "spell" being the word used to signify the means employed to carry out a magical action. A spell could consist of a set of words, a formula or verse, or a ritual action, or any combination of these.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary, the Compact Edition'', Oxford University Press, p. 2955, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Spells traditionally were cast by many methods, such as by the inscription of [[runes]] or [[sigil (magic)|sigils]] on an object to give it magical powers; by the immolation or binding of a wax or clay image ([[poppet]]) of a person to affect him or her magically; by the recitation of [[incantation]]s; by the performance of physical [[ritual]]s; by the employment of magical [[herb]]s as amulets or [[potion]]s; by gazing at mirrors, swords or other specula ([[scrying]]) for purposes of divination; and by many other means.&lt;ref&gt;for instance, see [[Georg Luck|Luck, Georg]], ''Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds; a Collection of Ancient Texts'', Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985, 2006; also Kittredge, G. L., ''Witchcraft in Old and New England'', New York: Russell &amp; Russell, 1929, 1957, 1958; and Davies, Owen, ''Witchcraft, Magic and Culture, 1736–1951'', Manchester University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Necromancy (conjuring the dead) ====
Strictly speaking, "[[necromancy]]" is the practice of conjuring the spirits of the dead for [[divination]] or [[prophecy]]&amp;nbsp;– although the term has also been applied to raising the dead for other purposes. The biblical [[Witch of Endor]] performed it (1 Sam. 28), and it is among the witchcraft practices condemned by [[Ælfric of Eynsham]]:&lt;ref&gt;

==== Demonology ====
{{main article|Demonology}}
In [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], sorcery came to be associated with [[heresy]] and [[apostasy]] and to be viewed as evil. Among the [[Catholics]], Protestants, and [[secular]] leadership of the [[Europe]]an Late [[Medieval]]/[[Early Modern]] period, fears about witchcraft rose to fever pitch and sometimes led to large-scale [[witch-hunt]]s. The key century was the fifteenth, which saw a dramatic rise in awareness and terror of witchcraft, culminating in the publication of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' but prepared by such fanatical popular preachers as Bernardino of Siena.&lt;ref&gt;For this dramatic rise in witchcraft consciousness during the fifteenth century and Bernardino's critical role in it, see Chapter 2 (pp. 52–108) Franco Mormando, ''The Preacher's Demons: Bernardino of Siena and the Social Underworld of Early Renaissance Italy''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-226-53854-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this time, it was increasingly believed that Christianity was engaged in an apocalyptic battle against the Devil and his secret army of witches, who had entered into a [[Deal with the Devil|diabolical pact]]. In total, tens or hundreds of thousands of people were executed, and others were imprisoned, tortured, banished, and had lands and possessions confiscated. The majority of those accused were women, though in some regions the majority were men.&lt;ref name="gibbons"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barstow, Anne Llewellyn (1994) ''Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts'' San Francisco:Pandora. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In early modern [[Scots_language|Scots]], the word [[Warlock]] came to be used as the male equivalent of [[witch (word)|witch]] (which can be male or female, but is used predominantly for females).&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, F. Marian, ''The Silver Bough: A Four Volume Study of the National and Local Festivals of Scotland'', Glasgow: William Maclellan,1957, vol 1; also Chambers, Robert, ''Domestic Annals of Scotland'', Edinburgh: 1861, and Sinclair, George, ''Satan's Invisible World Discovered'', Edinburgh, 1871&lt;/ref&gt; From this use, the word passed into [[Romanticism|Romantic]] literature and ultimately 20th-century [[Warlock (disambiguation)|popular culture]]. Accusations of witchcraft were often combined with other charges of heresy against such groups as the [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]].

The ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]],'' (Latin for "Hammer of The Witches") was a witch-hunting manual written in 1486 by two German monks, Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger. It was used by both Catholics and Protestants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0IAjBexFTgC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=malleus%20maleficarum%20protestant&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q=malleus%20maleficarum%20protestant&amp;f=false |title=The Emergence of Modern Europe: C. 1500 to 1788|publisher= Britannica Educational Publishing |page=27 |accessdate=2013-06-29|isbn=9781615303434 |date=2011-01-15 |editor-last1= Campbell|editor-first1=Heather M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; for several hundred years, outlining how to identify a witch, what makes a woman more likely than a man to be a witch, how to put a witch on trial, and how to punish a witch. The book defines a witch as evil and typically female. The book became the handbook for secular courts throughout Renaissance Europe, but was not used by the Inquisition, which even cautioned against relying on the work,&lt;ref&gt;'In 1538 the Spanish Inquisition cautioned its members not to believe everything the Malleus said, even when it presented apparently firm evidence.', Jolly, Raudvere, &amp; Peters(eds.), 'Witchcraft and magic in Europe: the Middle Ages', page 241 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and was later officially condemned by the Catholic Church in 1490.

In the modern Western world, witchcraft accusations have often accompanied the [[satanic ritual abuse]] [[moral panic]]. Such accusations are a counterpart to [[blood libel]] of various kinds, which may be found throughout history across the globe.

==== White witches ====
{{Main article|White witch}}

[[File:Rila Monastery wall painting.jpg|thumb|A painting in the [[Rila Monastery]] in [[Bulgaria]], condemning witchcraft and traditional [[folk magic]]]]
Throughout the [[early modern period]], the [[Early Modern English|English]] term "witch" was not exclusively negative in meaning, and could also indicate [[cunning folk]]. As Alan McFarlane noted, "There were a number of interchangeable terms for these practitioners, 'white', 'good', or 'unbinding' witches, blessers, wizards, sorcerers, however 'cunning-man' and 'wise-man' were the most frequent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=+interchangeable+terms+for+these+practitioners,+&amp;f=false|title=Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: A Regional and Comparative Study|first=Alan|last=Macfarlane|date=31 October 1999|publisher=Psychology Press|accessdate=31 October 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780415196123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary [[Reginald Scot]] explained, "At this day it is indifferent to say in the English tongue, 'she is a witch' or 'she is a wise woman'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scot |first=Reginald |authorlink=Reginald Scot |date=1584 |title=The Discoverie of Witchcraft |volume=Booke V |chapter=Chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folk magicians throughout Europe were often viewed ambivalently by communities, and were considered as capable of harming as of healing,&lt;ref&gt;Wilby, Emma (2006) ''Cunning Folk and Familiar Spirits''. pp. 51–4.&lt;/ref&gt; which could lead to their being accused as "witches" in the negative sense. Many English "witches" convicted of consorting with demons seem to have been cunning folk whose [[fairy]] [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s had been demonised;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Wilby 2005 p. 123; See also [https://books.google.com/books?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=white%20witches%20black%20witches&amp;f=false Alan Macfarlane p. 127 who notes how "white witches" could later be accused as "black witches".]&lt;/ref&gt; many French ''devins-guerisseurs'' ("diviner-healers") were accused of witchcraft,&lt;ref&gt;Monter () ''Witchcraft in France and Switzerland''. Ch. 7: "White versus Black Witchcraft".&lt;/ref&gt; and over one half the accused witches in Hungary seem to have been healers.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the healers and diviners historically accused of witchcraft have considered themselves mediators between the mundane and spiritual worlds, roughly equivalent to [[shamanism|shamans]].&lt;ref&gt;As defined by [[Mircea Eliade]] in ''Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'', Bollingen Series LXXVI, Pantheon Books, NY NY 1964, pp. 3–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Such people described their contacts with fairies, spirits often involving out-of-body experiences and travelling through the realms of an "other-world".&lt;ref name="Ginzburg 1990 Part 2, Ch. 1"&gt;Ginzburg (1990) Part 2, Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
Beliefs of this nature are implied in the folklore of much of Europe, and were explicitly described by accused witches in central and southern Europe. Repeated themes include participation in processions of the dead or large feasts, often presided over by a horned male deity or a female divinity who teaches magic and gives prophecies; and participation in battles against evil spirits, "vampires", or "witches" to win fertility and prosperity for the community.

=== Accusations of witchcraft ===
[[Éva Pócs]] states that reasons for accusations of witchcraft fall into four general categories:&lt;ref name="Pocs" /&gt;
# A person was caught in the act of positive or negative [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]]
# A well-meaning sorcerer or healer lost their clients' or the authorities' trust
# A person did nothing more than gain the enmity of their neighbours
# A person was reputed to be a witch and surrounded with an aura of witch-beliefs or [[Occultism]]

She identifies three varieties of witch in popular belief:&lt;ref name="Pocs" /&gt;
* The "neighbourhood witch" or "social witch": a witch who curses a neighbour following some conflict.
* The "magical" or "sorcerer" witch: either a professional healer, sorcerer, seer or midwife, or a person who has through magic increased her fortune to the perceived detriment of a neighbouring household; due to neighbourly or community rivalries and the ambiguity between positive and negative magic, such individuals can become labelled as witches.
* The "supernatural" or "night" witch: portrayed in court narratives as a demon appearing in visions and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
"Neighbourhood witches" are the product of neighbourhood tensions, and are found only in self-sufficient serf village communities where the inhabitants largely rely on each other. Such accusations follow the breaking of some social norm, such as the failure to return a borrowed item, and any person part of the normal social exchange could potentially fall under suspicion. Claims of "sorcerer" witches and "supernatural" witches could arise out of social tensions, but not exclusively; the supernatural witch in particular often had nothing to do with communal conflict, but expressed tensions between the human and supernatural worlds; and in Eastern and Southeastern Europe such supernatural witches became an ideology explaining calamities that befell entire communities.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Violence related to accusations====
Belief in witchcraft continues to be present today in some societies and accusations of witchcraft are the trigger of serious forms of violence, including murder. Such incidents are common in places such as [[Burkina Faso]], [[Ghana]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Nepal]] and [[Tanzania]]. Accusations of witchcraft are sometimes linked to personal disputes, jealousy, and conflicts between neighbors or family over land or inheritance. Witchcraft-related violence is often discussed as a serious issue in the broader context of [[violence against women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Co-publications/Femicide_A%20Gobal%20Issue%20that%20demands%20Action.pdf |title=A Global Issue that Demands Action |publisher=the Academic Council on the United Nations System (ACUNS) Vienna Liaison Office |date=2013 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1129&amp;context=djcil#H2N1 |title=CONFLICT BETWEEN STATE LEGAL NORMS AND NORMS UNDERLYING POPULAR BELIEFS: WITCHCRAFT IN AFRICA AS A CASE STUDY |publisher=DUKE JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE &amp; INTERNATIONAL LAW, Vol 14:351 |date=2005 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrc.ac.za/crime/witchhunts.pdf |title=WITCH HUNTS IN MODERN SOUTH AFRICA: AN UNDER-REPRESENTED FACET OF GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE |publisher=MRC-UNISA Crime, Violence and Injury Lead Programm |date=June 2009 |accessdate=2014-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425074549/http://www.mrc.ac.za/crime/witchhunts.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrights.asia/opinions/columns/AHRC-ETC-056-2011 |title=NEPAL: Witchcraft as a Superstition and a form of violence against women in Nepal — Asian Human Rights Commission |publisher=Humanrights.asia |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Mensah Adinkrah |url=http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/10/4/325.abstract |title=Witchcraft Accusations and Female Homicide Victimization in Contemporary Ghana |journal=Violence Against Women |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=325–356 |date=2004-04-01 |accessdate=2014-06-07|doi=10.1177/1077801204263419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary witchcraft ===
{{Further information|Neoshamanism|Modern paganism}}
Modern practices identified by their practitioners as "witchcraft" have grown dramatically since the early 20th century. Generally portrayed as revivals of pre-Christian European [[ritual]] and [[spirituality]], they are understood to involve varying degrees of [[Magic (paranormal)#Varieties of magical practice|magic]], [[shamanism]], [[folk medicine]], [[spiritual healing]], calling on [[elemental]]s and [[spirit]]s, veneration of ancient [[Pantheon (religion)|deities]] and [[archetype]]s, and attunement with the forces of nature.

The first [[Neopagan]] groups to publicly appear, during the 1950s and 60s, were [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]'s [[Bricket Wood coven]] and [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Roy Bowers]]' [[Clan of Tubal Cain]]. They operated as [[initiation|initiatory]] [[secret society|secret societies]]. Other individual practitioners and writers such as [[Paul Huson]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]] ''[[Mastering Witchcraft]]: a Practical Guide for Witches, Warlocks, and Covens'', New York: G.P. Putnams Sons, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; also claimed inheritance to surviving traditions of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, Chas S., ''Her Hidden Children: The Rise of Wicca and Paganism in America'', Lanham, MD: Altamira, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7591-0202-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wicca ====
{{Main article|Wicca}}
During the 20th century, interest in witchcraft in [[English language|English-speaking]] and European countries began to increase, inspired particularly by [[Margaret Murray]]'s theory of a [[Witch-cult hypothesis|pan-European witch-cult]] originally published in 1921, since discredited by further careful historical research.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Elliot, ''A Razor for a Goat'', [[University of Toronto Press]], 1962. Hutton, Ronald, ''The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles'', [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge, Mass.]]: [[Blackwell Publishers]], 1993. Hutton, Ronald, ''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest was intensified, however, by [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner's]] claim in 1954 in ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' that a form of witchcraft still existed in [[England]]. The truth of Gardner's claim is now disputed too, with different historians offering evidence for&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Wiccan Roots |isbn=978-1-86163-110-7|year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Gerald Gardner and the Cauldron of Inspiration |isbn=978-1-86163-164-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or against&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Aidan, ''Crafting the Art of Magic'', [[Llewellyn Worldwide|Llewellyn Publications]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Ronald, ''Triumph of the Moon'', Oxford University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruickbie |first=Leo |authorlink=Leo Ruickbie |title=Witchcraft Out of the Shadows |isbn=978-0-7090-7567-7|year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the religion's existence prior to Gardner.

The Wicca that Gardner initially taught was a witchcraft religion having a lot in common with Margaret Murray's hypothetically posited cult of the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Margaret A., ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'', Oxford University Press, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Murray wrote an introduction to Gardner's ''Witchcraft Today'', in effect putting her stamp of approval on it. Wicca is now practised as a religion of an [[Initiation|initiatory]] [[secret society]] nature with positive ethical principles, organised into autonomous [[coven]]s and led by a High Priesthood. There is also a large "Eclectic Wiccan" movement of individuals and groups who share key Wiccan beliefs but have no initiatory connection or affiliation with traditional Wicca. Wiccan writings and ritual show borrowings from a number of sources including 19th and 20th-century [[ceremonial magic]], the medieval grimoire known as the [[Key of Solomon]], [[Aleister Crowley]]'s [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] and pre-Christian religions.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, R.,''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', Oxford University Press, pp. 205–252, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, A.A., ''Crafting the Art of Magic, Book I: a History of Modern Witchcraft, 1939–1964'', Minnesota: [[Llewellyn Publications]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valiente, D., ''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', London: Robert Hale, pp. 35–62, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Both men and women are equally termed "witches." They practice a form of [[Duotheism|duotheistic]] [[universalism]].

Since Gardner's death in 1964, the Wicca that he claimed he was initiated into has attracted many initiates, becoming the largest of the various witchcraft traditions in the Western world, and has influenced other Neopagan and occult movements.

=====Witchcraft, feminism, and media=====
Wiccan literature has been described as aiding the empowerment of young women through its lively portrayal of female protagonists. Part of the recent growth in Neo-Pagan religions has been attributed to the strong media presence of fictional works such as the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]] and [[Harry Potter]] series with their depictions of witchcraft.&lt;ref name=tosenberger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tosenberger|first=Catherine|title=Neo-Paganism for teens|url=http://jeunessejournal.ca/index.php/yptc/article/view/81/63|journal=Jeunesse: Young People, Texts, Cultures|volume=2.2|year=2010|pages=172–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread accessibility to related material through internet media such as chat rooms and forums is also thought to be driving this development. Wiccan beliefs are currently often found to be compatible with liberal ideals such as the [[Green movement]], and particularly with [[feminism]] by providing young women with means for empowerment and for control of their own lives.&lt;ref name=jarvis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=Christine|title=Becoming a woman through Wicca: Witches and wiccans in contemporary teen fiction|journal=Children's Literature in Education|volume=39|issue=1|year=2008|pages= 43–52|doi=10.1007/s10583-007-9058-0|url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/4140/2/CLE_Jarvis_Wicca_article_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=merskin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merskin|first=Debra|title=Joining Forces: Teen Girl Witches and Internet Chat Groups|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/7/1/3/0/p171306_index.html |journal=Proceedings of the International Communication Association|date=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the case particularly in North America due to the strong presence of feminist ideals.&lt;ref name=tosenberger/&gt; The 2002 study [[Enchanted Feminism|Enchanted Feminism: The Reclaiming Witches of San Francisco]] suggests that Wiccan religion represents the second wave of feminism that has also been redefined as a religious movement.&lt;ref name=jarvis/&gt;

==== Stregheria ====
{{Main article|Stregheria}}
Stregheria is an [[Italy|Italian]] witchcraft religion popularised in the 1980s by [[Raven Grimassi]], who claims that it evolved within the ancient [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan religion]] of Italian peasants who worked under the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] upper classes.

Modern Stregheria closely resembles [[Charles Leland]]'s controversial late-19th-century account of a surviving Italian religion of witchcraft, worshipping the Goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], her brother [[Dianus]]/[[Lucifer]], and their daughter [[Aradia]]. Leland's witches do not see Lucifer as the evil [[Satan]] that Christians see, but a benevolent god of the Sun and Moon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism|first1=Shelley|last1=Rabinovitch|first2=James|last2=Lewis|year=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual format of contemporary Stregheria is roughly similar to that of other Neopagan witchcraft religions such as [[Wicca]]. The [[pentagram]] is the most common symbol of religious identity. Most followers celebrate a series of eight festivals equivalent to the Wiccan [[Wheel of the Year]], though others follow the ancient Roman festivals. An emphasis is placed on [[ancestor worship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stregheria.com/FAQ.html|website=Stregheria.com|title=Stregheria.com FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Traditional witchcraft ====
{{Main article|Traditional witchcraft}}
Traditional witchcraft is a term used to refer to a variety of contemporary forms of witchcraft. Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White described it as "a broad movement of aligned magico-religious groups who reject any relation to Gardnerianism and the wider Wiccan movement, claiming older, more "traditional" roots. Although typically united by a shared aesthetic rooted in European folklore, the Traditional Craft contains within its ranks a rich and varied array of occult groups, from those who follow a contemporary Pagan path that is suspiciously similar to Wicca to those who adhere to [[Luciferianism]]".{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|pp=205–206}} According to British Traditional Witch Michael Howard, the term refers to "any non-Gardnerian, non-Alexandrian, non-Wiccan or pre-modern form of the Craft, especially if it has been inspired by historical forms of witchcraft and folk magic".&lt;ref&gt;[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition was offered by Daniel A. Schulke, the current Magister of the Cultus Sabbati, when he proclaimed that ''traditional witchcraft'' "refers to a coterie of initiatory lineages of ritual magic, spellcraft and devotional mysticism".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch06|Schulke 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of traditional witchcraft are the [[Feri Tradition]], [[Cochrane's Craft]] and the Sabbatic craft.&lt;ref&gt;[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary witchcraft, Satanism and Luciferianism ===
{{main article|Satanism|Satanism and Witchcraft}}
[[File:Baphomet.png|thumb|[[Eliphas Levi|Eliphas Lévi's]] Sabbatic goat (known as The Goat of Mendes or [[Baphomet]]) is one of Satanism's most common symbols.]]

[[Satanism]] is a broad term referring to diverse beliefs that share a symbolic association with, or admiration for, [[Satan]], who is seen as a liberating figure. While it is heir to the same historical period and pre-Enlightenment beliefs that gave rise to modern witchcraft, it is generally seen as completely separate from modern witchcraft and Wicca, and has little or no connection to them.

Modern witchcraft considers Satanism to be the "dark side of Christianity" rather than a branch of Wicca: – the character of Satan referenced in Satanism exists only in the theology of the three Abrahamic religions, and Satanism arose as, and occupies the role of, a rebellious counterpart to Christianity, in which all is permitted and the self is central. (Christianity can be characterized as having the diametrically opposite views to these.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smokyhole.org/wicca/satvnp.htm|title=Satanism vs. Neo-Pagan Witchcraft|work=holysmoke.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such beliefs become more visibly expressed in Europe after the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when works such as [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' were described anew by [[Romanticism|romantics]] who suggested that they presented the biblical Satan as an [[allegory]] representing crisis of faith, [[individualism]], [[free will]], [[wisdom]] and [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]; a few works from that time also begin to directly present Satan in a less negative light, such as ''[[Letters from the Earth]]''. The two major trends are [[theistic Satanism]] and [[Satanism#Atheistic Satanism|atheistic Satanism]]; the former venerates Satan as a supernatural [[patriarchal]] [[deity]], while the latter views Satan as merely a symbolic embodiment of certain human traits.&lt;ref name="Point of Inquiry Interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilmore|first=Peter|title=Science and Satanism|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/|work=Point of Inquiry Interview|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized groups began to emerge in the mid 20th century, including the [[Ophite Cultus Satanas]] (1948)&lt;ref name=JamesRLewis&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=James R.|title=The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions|date=2002|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1573922227|page=553|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lk8_ARNz-dYC&amp;pg=PA553&amp;lpg=PA553&amp;dq=Ophite+Cultus+Satanas+arthur+sloane#v=onepage&amp;q=Ophite%20Cultus%20Satanas%20arthur%20sloane&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Church of Satan]] (1966).  After seeing [[Margaret Murray]]'s book ''The God of the Witches'' the leader of Ophite Cultus Satanas, Herbert Arthur Sloane, said he realized that the horned god was Satan (''Sathanas''). Sloane also corresponded with his contemporary [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], founder of the Wicca religion, and implied that his views of Satan and the horned god were not necessarily in conflict with Gardner's approach. However, he did believe that, while "gnosis" referred to knowledge, and "[[Wicca]]" referred to wisdom, modern witches had fallen away from the true knowledge, and instead had begun worshipping a [[fertility god]], a reflection of the creator god. He wrote that "the largest existing body of witches who are true Satanists would be the [[Yezedees]]". Sloane highly recommended the book ''The Gnostic Religion'', and sections of it were sometimes read at ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Magic, Satanism, Voodoo'', by Dr. Leo L. Martello, 1972 (Interview with Sloane on pp. 31–34, ''Our Lord Sathanas'')&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that there were up to 100,000 Satanists worldwide by 2006, twice the number estimated in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/satanism.htm|accessdate=March 24, 2013|date=March 2006|title=Religious Satanism, 16th century Satanism, Satanic Dabbling, etc|publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance|author=B.A. Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satanistic beliefs have been largely permitted as a valid expression of religious belief in the West. For example, they were allowed in the [[British Royal Navy]] in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/10/24/uk.devilworship/index.html Royal Navy to allow devil worship] ''[[CNN]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Helen.

[[Luciferianism]], on the other hand, is a belief system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://altreligion.about.com/od/alternativereligionsaz/a/How-Luciferians-Differ-From-Satanists.htm|title=How Luciferians Differ From Satanists|author=Catherine Beyer|work=[[About.com]] Religion &amp; Spirituality|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and does not revere the [[devil]] figure or most characteristics typically affixed to [[Satan]].

[[Madeline Montalban]] was an English witch who adhered to a specific form of luciferianism which revolved around the veneration of Lucifer, or Lumiel, whom she considered to be a benevolent angelic being who had aided humanity's development. Within her Order, she emphasised that her followers discover their own personal relationship with the angelic beings, including Lumiel.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=26, 85–86}} Although initially seeming favourable to Gerald Gardner, by the mid-1960s she had become hostile towards him and his Gardnerian tradition, considering him to be "a 'dirty old man' and sexual pervert."{{sfnm|1a1=Howard|1y=2010|1p=7|2a1=Philips|2y=2012|2p=69}} She also expressed hostility to another prominent Pagan Witch of the period, [[Charles Cardell]], although in the 1960s became friends with the two Witches at the forefront of the [[Alexandrian Wicca]]n tradition, [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] and his wife, [[Maxine Sanders]], who adopted some of her Luciferian angelic practices.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=69–70}} In contemporary times luciferian witches exist within traditional witchcraft.{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|pp=205–206}}

== Historical and religious perspectives ==
===Near East beliefs===
The belief in sorcery and its practice seem to have been widespread in the [[Ancient Near East]] and [[Nile Valley]]. It played a conspicuous role in the cultures of [[ancient Egypt]] and in [[Babylonia]]. The latter tradition included an [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] anti-witchcraft ritual, the [[Maqlû]]. A section from the [[Code of Hammurabi]] (about 2000 B.C.) prescribes:

{{quote|If a man has put a spell upon another man and it is not justified, he upon whom the spell is laid shall go to the holy river; into the holy river shall he plunge. If the holy river overcome him and he is drowned, the man who put the spell upon him shall take possession of his house. If the holy river declares him innocent and he remains unharmed the man who laid the spell shall be put to death. He that plunged into the river shall take possession of the house of him who laid the spell upon him.&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' [http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/W/WITCH%3B+WITCHCRAFT/ article on Witchcraft], last accessed 31 March 2006. There is some discrepancy between translations; compare with that given in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm article on Witchcraft] (accessed 31 March 2006), and the [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hamframe.htm L.

===Abrahamic religions===
==== Hebrew Bible ====
{{Main article|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}
According to the New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia: {{quote|In the Holy Scripture references to sorcery are frequent, and the strong condemnations of such practices found there do not seem to be based so much upon the supposition of [[fraud]] as upon the abomination of the magic in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Witchcraft |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1912-10-01 |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Wickiana3.jpg|thumb|left|Execution of alleged witches in Central Europe, 1587]]
The [[King James Version]] uses the words "witch", "witchcraft", and "witchcrafts" to translate the [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} ''kāsháf'' ({{IPA-he|kɔˈʃaf}}) and {{hebrew|קֶסֶם}} (''qésem'');&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Nahum|3:4|}}; {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|15:23|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|33:6|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|9:22|}}; {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:10|}}; {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:18|}}&lt;/ref&gt; these same English terms are used to translate {{lang|grc|φαρμακεία}} ''pharmakeia'' in the [[Greek New Testament]]. Verses such as {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:11–12|}} and {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:18|}} ("Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live") thus provided scriptural justification for Christian [[witch-hunt|witch hunters]] in the [[early modern period]] (see [[Christian views on magic]]).

The precise meaning of the Hebrew {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}}, usually translated as "witch" or "sorceress", is uncertain. In the [[Septuagint]], it was translated as ''pharmakeía'' or ''pharmakous''. In the 16th century, [[Reginald Scot]], a prominent critic of the witch trials, translated {{Hebrew|כָּשַׁף}}, φαρμακεία, and the [[Vulgate]]'s [[Latin]] equivalent ''veneficos'' as all meaning "poisoner", and on this basis, claimed that "witch" was an incorrect translation and poisoners were intended.&lt;ref&gt;Scot, Reginald (c. 1580) ''The Discoverie of Witchcraft'' Booke VI Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; His theory still holds some currency, but is not widely accepted, and in {{bibleverse||Daniel|2:2|}} {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} is listed alongside other magic practitioners who could interpret dreams: magicians, astrologers, and Chaldeans. Suggested derivations of {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} include "mutterer" (from a single root) or ''herb user'' (as a compound word formed from the roots ''kash'', meaning "herb", and ''hapaleh'', meaning "using"). The Greek φαρμακεία literally means "herbalist" or one who uses or administers drugs, but it was used virtually synonymously with ''[[Magic (paranormal)|mageia]]'' and ''[[Goetia|goeteia]]'' as a term for a sorcerer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dickie |first=Matthew |title=Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World |pages=33–35 |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-24982-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible provides some evidence that these commandments against sorcery were enforced under the Hebrew kings:
{{quote|And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I [[prithee|pray thee]], divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee. And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?&lt;ref&gt;I Samuel 28.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Note that the Hebrew word {{hebrew|אֹב}} ''ob'', translated as ''familiar spirit'' in the above quotation, has a different meaning than the usual English sense of the phrase; namely, it refers to a spirit that the woman is familiar with, rather than to [[familiar spirit|a spirit that physically manifests itself in the shape of an animal]].

==== New Testament ====
{{See also|Christian views on magic}}
The [[New Testament]] condemns the practice as an abomination, just as the Old Testament had ([[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 5:20, compared with [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 21:8; 22:15; and [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 8:9; 13:6). The word in most New Testament translations is "sorcerer"/"sorcery" rather than "witch"/"witchcraft".

==== Judaism ====
{{See also|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}
[[Halakha|Jewish law]] views the practice of witchcraft as being laden with [[idolatry]] and/or [[necromancy]]; both being serious theological and practical offenses in [[Judaism]]. Although [[Maimonides]] vigorously denied the efficacy of all methods of witchcraft, and claimed that the Biblical prohibitions regarding it were precisely to wean the Israelites from practices related to [[idolatry]]. It is acknowledged that while magic exists, it is forbidden to practice it on the basis that it usually involves the worship of other gods. [[Rabbi]]s of the Talmud also condemned magic when it produced something other than illusion, giving the example of two men who use magic to pick cucumbers (Sanhedrin 67a). The one who creates the illusion of picking cucumbers should not be condemned, only the one who actually picks the cucumbers through magic.

However, some of the rabbis practiced "magic" themselves or taught the subject. For instance, [[Rabbah]] created a person and sent him to [[Rav Zeira]], and [[Hanina]] and [[Hoshaiah]] studied every Friday together and created a small calf to eat on [[Shabbat]] (Sanhedrin 67b). In these cases, the "magic" was seen more as divine miracles (i.e., coming from [[God]] rather than "unclean" forces) than as witchcraft.

Judaism does make it clear that Jews shall not try to learn about the ways of witches ([[Book of Deuteronomy]] 18: 9–10) and that witches are to be put to death ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:17).

Judaism's most famous reference to a medium is undoubtedly the [[Witch of Endor]] whom [[Saul]] consults, as recounted in [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 28.

==== Islam ====

Islam distinguishes between God-given gifts, which can heal sickness, and [[Demonic possession#Islam|possession]], and sorcery. Good supernatural powers are therefore a ''special gift from [[God in Islam|God]]'', whereas sorcery or black magic is achieved through help of [[jinn]] and [[Shaitan|demons]]. In the Qurʾānic narrative, the [[Solomon in Islam|Prophet Sulayman]] had the power to speak with animals and command jinn, and he thanks God for this نعمة (i.e. gift, privilege, favour, bounty), which is only given to him with God’s permission.{{Cite Quran|27|19}}&lt;ref&gt;''Tafsir Ibn Kathir'' for surah 21, verse 19&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]] was accused of being a magician by his opponents.{{Cite Quran|10|2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1374|title=Magic - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[hadith]]'' recorded in {{hadith-usc|bukhari|8|76|479}} states: "Seventy thousand people of my followers will enter Paradise without accounts, and they are those who do not practice Ar-Ruqya and do not see an evil omen in things, and put their trust in their Lord." [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya]], a [[Islamic scholar|scholar]], commented on this ''hadith'', stating: That is because these people will enter Paradise without being called to account because of the perfection of their Tawheed, therefore he described them as people who did not ask others to perform ruqyah for them. Hence he said "and they put their trust in their Lord." Because of their complete trust in their Lord, their contentment with Him, their faith in Him, their being pleased with Him and their seeking their needs from Him, they do not ask people for anything, be it ruqyah or anything else, and they are not influenced by omens and superstitions that could prevent them from doing what they want to do, because superstition detracts from and weakens Tawheed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zad al-Ma'ad|last=al-Jawziyya|first=Ibn Qayyim|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1/475|trans-title=Provisions of the Hereafter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Southern African traditions, there are three classifications of somebody who uses magic. The ''[[tagati]]'' is usually improperly translated into English as "witch", and is a spiteful person who operates in secret to harm others. The ''[[sangoma]]'' is a diviner, somewhere on a par with a [[fortune teller]], and is employed in detecting illness, predicting a person's future (or advising them on which path to take), or identifying the guilty party in a crime. She also practices some degree of medicine. The ''inyanga'' is often translated as "witch doctor" (though many Southern Africans resent this implication, as it perpetuates the mistaken belief that a "witch doctor" is in some sense a ''practitioner'' of malicious magic). The ''inyanga''{{'}}s job is to heal illness and injury and provide customers with magical items for everyday use. Of these three categories the ''tagati'' is almost exclusively female, the ''sangoma'' is usually female, and the ''inyanga'' is almost exclusively male.

Much of what witchcraft represents in Africa has been susceptible to misunderstandings and confusion, thanks in no small part to a tendency among western scholars since the time of the now largely discredited [[Margaret Murray]] to approach the subject through a comparative lens vis-a-vis European witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okeja|first=Uchenna|title="An African Context of the Belief in Witchcraft and Magic," in Rational Magic|date=2011|publisher=Fisher Imprints|isbn=978-1-84888-061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Okeja argues that witchcraft in Africa today plays a very different social role than in Europe of the past—or present—and should be understood through an African rather than post-colonial Western lens.

Complimentary remarks about witchcraft by a native Congolese initiate: "From witchcraft ... may be developed the remedy (''kimbuki'') that will do most to raise up our country."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 54b (13.9.12).&lt;/ref&gt; "Witchcraft ... deserves respect ... it can embellish or redeem (''ketula evo vuukisa'')."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 54b (13.9.14).&lt;/ref&gt; "The ancestors were equipped with the protective witchcraft of the clan (''kindoki kiandundila kanda''). ... They could also gather the power of animals into their hands ... whenever they needed. ... If we could make use of these kinds of witchcraft, our country would rapidly progress in knowledge of every kind."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, pp. 54b-55a (13.9.16).&lt;/ref&gt; "You witches (''zindoki'') too, bring your science into the light to be written down so that ... the benefits in it ... endow our race."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 55b (13.10.8).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cameroon ====

In eastern Cameroon, the term used for witchcraft among the [[Maka people|Maka]] is ''djambe''&lt;ref&gt;Geschiere, Peter; "''The Modernity of Witchcraft: Politics and the Occult in Postcolonial Africa''" (1997) University of Virginia Press. {{ISBN|0-8139-1703-4}} (paperback). Translated by Geschiere, Peter &amp; Roitman, Janet from the originally published in French: "''Sorcellerie et politique en Afrique – La viande des autres''" (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to a force inside a person; its powers may make the proprietor more vulnerable. It encompasses the occult, the transformative, killing and healing.&lt;ref&gt;''idem'' (Geschiere, 1997, p.13)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Central Africa ====
In some [[Central Africa]]n areas, malicious magic users are believed by locals to be the source of [[terminal illness]] such as [[AIDS]] and [[cancer]]. In such cases, various methods are used to rid the person from the bewitching spirit, occasionally [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[psychological abuse]]. Children may be accused of being witches, for example a young niece may be blamed for the illness of a relative. Most of these cases of abuse go unreported since the members of the society that witness such abuse are too afraid of being accused of being accomplices. It is also believed that witchcraft can be transmitted to children by feeding. Parents discourage their children from interacting with people believed to be witches.{{dubious|date=August 2018}}{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Every year, hundreds of people in the [[Central African Republic]] are convicted of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/africanews/2010/02/04/the-dangers-of-witchcraft/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312100813/http://blogs.reuters.com/africanews/2010/02/04/the-dangers-of-witchcraft/ |archivedate=2010-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-balaka|Christian militias]] in the Central African Republic have also kidnapped, burnt and buried alive women accused of being 'witches' in public ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Esslemont 2015"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Esslemont | first=Tom | title=Witch burning rebels stoke Central African Republic violence | newspaper=Reuters | date=26 November 2015 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-centralafrica-witchcraft/witch-burning-rebels-stoke-central-african-republic-violence-idUSKBN0TF03920151126 | access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Democratic Republic of the Congo ====
{{As of|2006}}, between 25,000 and 50,000 children in [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], had been accused of witchcraft and thrown out of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Dowden in Kinshasa |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/12/theobserver.worldnews11 |title=Thousands of child 'witches' turned on to the streets to starve &amp;#124; World news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These children have been subjected to often-violent abuse during [[exorcism]]s, sometimes supervised by self-styled religious pastors. Other pastors and Christian activists strongly oppose such accusations and try to rescue children from their unscrupulous colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/september/27.62.html|title=Kolwezi: Accused of witchcraft by parents and churches, children in the Democratic Republic of Congo are being rescued by Christian activists|website=Christianity Today|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual term for these children is ''enfants sorciers'' (child witches) or ''enfants dits sorciers'' (children accused of witchcraft). In 2002, [[USAID]] funded the production of two short films on the subject, made in Kinshasa by journalists Angela Nicoara and Mike Ormsby.

In April 2008, in Kinshasa, the police arrested 14 suspected victims (of [[penis snatching]]) and [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]] accused of using black magic or witchcraft to steal (make disappear) or shrink men's penises to extort cash for cure, amid a wave of panic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bavier |first=Joe |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN2319603620080423?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=oddlyEnoughNews&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true |title=Penis theft panic hits city.. |newspaper=Reuters |date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one study, the belief in magical warfare technologies (such as "bulletproofing") in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo serves a group-level function, as it increases group efficiency in warfare, even if it is suboptimal at the individual level.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nunn |first=Nathan |authorlink=Nathan Nunn |last2=Sierra |first2=Raul Sanchez de la |date=2017 |title=Why Being Wrong can be Right: Magical Warfare Technologies and the Persistence of False Beliefs |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=107 |issue=5 |pages=582–87 |doi=10.1257/aer.p20171091 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the study argue that this is one reason why the belief in witchcraft persists.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Ghana ====
In [[Ghana]], women are often accused of witchcraft and attacked by neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphic.com.gh/dailygraphic/page.php?news=10405 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108050152/http://graphic.com.gh/dailygraphic/page.php?news=10405 |archivedate=2011-01-08 |title=My Mum is Not A Witch |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, there exist six [[witch camp]]s in the country where women suspected of being witches can flee for safety.&lt;ref name="Camps"&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19437130 | title=Ghana witch camps: Widows' lives in exile | publisher=BBC | accessdate=September 1, 2012| work=BBC News | date=September 2012 | last1=Whitaker | first1=Kati }}&lt;/ref&gt; The witch camps, which exist solely in Ghana, are thought to house a total of around 1000 women.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt; Some of the camps are thought to have been set up over 100 years ago.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt; The Ghanaian government has announced that it intends to close the camps.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt;

Arrests were made in an effort to avoid bloodshed seen in [[Ghana]] a decade ago, when 12 alleged penis snatchers were beaten to death by mobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9701/18/briefs/ghana.penis.html ''7 killed in Ghana over 'penis-snatching' episodes''], CNN, January 18, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is easy for modern people to dismiss such reports, Uchenna Okeja argues that a belief system in which such magical practices are deemed possible offer many benefits to Africans who hold them. For example, the belief that a sorcerer has "stolen" a man's penis functions as an anxiety-reduction mechanism for men suffering from impotence while simultaneously providing an explanation that is consistent with African cultural beliefs rather than appealing to Western scientific notions that are tainted by the history of colonialism (at least for many Africans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okeja |first=Uchenna |title="An African Context of the Belief in Witchcraft and Magic," in Rational Magic|date=2011|publisher=Fisher Imprints|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-84888-061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Kenya ====
It was reported on May 21, 2008 that in [[Kenya]], a mob had burnt to death at least 11 people accused of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Reuters Editorial |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL21301127 |title=Mob burns to death 11 Kenyan "witches" |newspaper=Reuters |date=2008-05-21 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Malawi ====
In [[Malawi]] it is also common practice to accuse children of witchcraft and many children have been abandoned, abused and even killed as a result. As in other African countries both African traditional healers and their Christian counterparts are trying to make a living out of exorcising children and are actively involved in pointing out children as witches.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Carrie 2011. Hunting the vulnerable: Witchcraft and the law in Malawi; Consultancy Africa Intelligence (16 June):&lt;/ref&gt; Various secular and Christian organizations are combining their efforts to address this problem.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Meer, Erwin 2011. The Problem of Witchcraft in Malawi, Evangelical Missions Quarterly (47:1, January): 78–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[William Kamkwamba]], witches and wizards are afraid of money, which they consider a rival evil. Any contact with [[cash]] will snap their spell and leave the wizard naked and confused. So placing cash, such as [[Malawian kwacha|kwacha]] around a room or bed mat will protect the resident from their malevolent spells.&lt;ref&gt;Kamkwamba, William. The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind. Harper Collins. 2009. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nigeria ====
In [[Nigeria]], several Pentecostal pastors have mixed their evangelical brand of Christianity with African beliefs in witchcraft to benefit from the lucrative witch finding and exorcism business—which in the past was the exclusive domain of the so-called witch doctor or traditional healers. These pastors have been involved in the torturing and even killing of children accused of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humantrafficking.org/publications/593|title=Stepping Stones Nigeria 2007. Supporting Victims of Witchcraft Abuse and Street Children in Nigeria|website=humantrafficking.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017185346/http://humantrafficking.org/publications/593|archivedate=2012-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past decade, around 15,000 children have been accused, and around 1,000 murdered. Churches are very numerous in Nigeria, and competition for congregations is hard. Some pastors attempt to establish a reputation for spiritual power by "detecting" child witches, usually following a death or loss of a job within a family, or an accusation of financial fraud against the pastor. In the course of "exorcisms", accused children may be starved, beaten, mutilated, set on fire, forced to consume acid or cement, or buried alive. While some church leaders and Christian activists have spoken out strongly against these abuses, many Nigerian churches are involved in the abuse, although church administrations deny knowledge of it.&lt;ref&gt;Houreld, Katharine (2009) [http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/church-burns-witchcraft-children/story-e6frev00-1225788721635 Church burns 'witchcraft' children]. Associated Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sierra Leone ====
Among the Mende (of [[Sierra Leone]]), trial and conviction for witchcraft has a beneficial effect for those convicted. "The witchfinder had warned the whole village to ensure the relative prosperity of the accused and sentenced ... old people. ... Six months later all of the people ... accused, were secure, well-fed and arguably happier than at any [previous] time; they had hardly to beckon and people would come with food or whatever was needful. ... Instead of such old and widowed people being left helpless or (as in Western society) institutionalized in old people's homes, these were reintegrated into society and left secure in their old age ... . ... Old people are 'suitable' candidates for this kind of accusation in the sense that they are isolated and vulnerable, and they are 'suitable' candidates for 'social security' for precisely the same reasons."&lt;ref&gt;Gittins 1987, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kuranko language]], the term for witchcraft is ''suwa'ye''&lt;ref&gt;West, Harry G. "''Ethnographic Sorcery''" (p.24); 2007. The University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|978-0-226-89398-3}} (pbk.), {{ISBN|0-226-89398-7}} (pbk.)&lt;/ref&gt; referring to "extraordinary powers".

==== Tanzania ====
In [[Tanzania]] in 2008, President [[Jakaya Kikwete|Kikwete]] publicly condemned [[witchdoctor]]s for killing [[Albinism|albinos]] for their body parts, which are thought to bring good luck. 25 albinos have been murdered since March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7518049.stm Living in fear: Tanzania's albinos], BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt; In Tanzania, albinos are often murdered for their body parts on the advice of witch doctors in order to produce powerful amulets that are believed to protect against witchcraft and make the owner prosper in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/blogs/?p=348|title=Wicasta 2011.

=== Americas ===
==== Caribbean ====

Brua is an Afro-Caribbean religion and healing tradition that originates in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, in the Dutch Caribbean. A healer in this culture is called a ''kurioso'' or ''kuradó'', a man or woman who performs ''trabou chikí'' (little works) and ''trabou grandi'' (large treatments) to promote or restore health, bring fortune or misfortune, deal with unrequited love, and more serious concerns, in which sorcery is involved. Sorcery usually involves reference to the ''almasola'' or ''homber chiki'', a devil-like entity. ''Transcultural Psychiatry'' published a paper called "Traditional healing practices originating in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao: A review of the literature on psychiatry and Brua" by Jan Dirk Blom, Igmar T. Poulina, Trevor L. van Gellecum and Hans W. Hoek of the Parnassia Psychiatric Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278016204|title=Traditional healing practices originating in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao: A review of the literature on psychiatry and Brua|first1=Jan Dirk|last1=Blom|first2=Igmar|last2=T.

[[File:Matteson Examination of a Witch.jpg|thumb|''Examination of a Witch'' by [[T. H. Matteson]], inspired by the [[Salem witch trials]]]]
In 1645, [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], experienced America's first accusations of witchcraft when husband and wife Hugh and Mary Parsons accused each other of witchcraft.

The [[Salem witch trials]] followed in 1692–93. These witch trials were the most famous in [[British North America]] and took place in the coastal settlements near [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. Prior to the witch trials, nearly 300 men and women had been suspected of partaking in witchcraft, and 19 of these people were hanged, and one was “pressed to death”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=America: A Narrative History|year=2013|publisher=W.W.

Over 150 people were arrested and imprisoned, with even more accused who were not formally pursued by the authorities. The two courts convicted 29 people of the capital felony of witchcraft. Nineteen of the accused, 14 women and 5 men, were hanged. [[Giles Corey|One man]] who refused to enter a plea was crushed to death under heavy stones in an attempt to force him to do so. At least five more of the accused died in prison.

Despite being generally known as the "Salem" witch trials, the preliminary hearings in 1692 were conducted in a variety of towns across the province: Salem Village (now [[Danvers, Massachusetts|Danvers]]), [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem Town]], [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]], and [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]]. The best known trials were conducted by the Court of [[Oyer and Terminer]] in 1692 in Salem Town.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.salemwitchmuseum.com/education|title=Salem Witch Museum|website=www.salemwitchmuseum.com|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 26 who went to trial before this court were convicted. The four sessions of the Superior Court of Judicature in 1693, held in Salem Town, but also in Ipswich, Boston, and Charlestown, produced only 3 convictions in the 31 witchcraft trials it conducted. Likewise, alleged witchcraft was not isolated to New England. In 1706 [[Grace Sherwood]] the "Witch of Pungo" was imprisoned for the crime in [[Princess Anne County, Virginia]].

In Maryland, there is a legend of Moll Dyer, who escaped a fire set by fellow colonists only to die of exposure in December&amp;nbsp;1697. The historical record of Dyer is scant as all official records were burned in a courthouse fire, though the county courthouse has on display the rock where her frozen body was found. A letter from a colonist of the period describes her in most unfavourable terms. A local road is named after Dyer, where her homestead was said to have been. Many local families have their own version of the Moll Dyer affair, and her name is spoken with care in the rural southern counties.&lt;ref&gt;David W.

==== Diné / Navajo ====
In [[Navajo people|Diné culture]], witches are seen as the polar opposite of [[medicine man|ceremonial people]]. While spiritual leaders perform "[[Navajo song ceremonial complex|sings]]" for healing, protection and other beneficial purposes, all practices referred to as "witchcraft" are intended to hurt and curse. Witches are associated with harm to the community and transgression of societal standards, especially those relating to family and the dead.

The ''yee naaldlooshii'' is the type of witch known in English as a "[[skin-walker]]". They are believed to take the forms of animals in order to travel in secret and do harm to the innocent.&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;Wall, Leon and William Morgan, ''Navajo-English Dictionary''. Hippocrene Books, New York City, 1998 {{ISBN|0-7818-0247-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Navajo language]], ''{{lang|nv|yee naaldlooshii}}'' translates to "with it, he goes on all fours".&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;  While perhaps the most common variety seen in horror fiction by non-Navajo people, the ''{{lang|nv|yee naaldlooshii}}'' is one of several varieties of Navajo witch, specifically a type of  ''{{lang|nv|’ánti’įhnii}}''.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;

Corpse powder or corpse poison ({{lang-nv|{{spell-nv|áńt’į́}}}}, literally "witchery" or "harming") is a substance made from powdered corpses.  The powder is used by witches to curse their victims.&lt;ref name="PerroneStockel1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perrone|first1=Bobette|last2=Stockel|first2=H.

Sometimes, however, the victims simply [[wasting|wastes away]], as from a normal disease.

Traditional Navajos usually hesitate to discuss things like witches and witchcraft with non-Navajos.&lt;ref name=Keene&gt;Keene, Dr. Adrienne, "[http://nativeappropriations.com/2016/03/magic-in-north-america-part-1-ugh.html Magic in North America Part 1: Ugh.]" at ''[[Native Appropriations]]'', 8 March 2016. Accessed 9 April 2016: "What happens when Rowling pulls this in, is we as Native people are now opened up to a barrage of questions about these beliefs and traditions ... but these are not things that need or should be discussed by outsiders. At all. I’m sorry if that seems "unfair," but that's how our cultures survive."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Brujería}}
Witchcraft was also an important part of the social and cultural history of late-Colonial Mexico, during the [[Mexican Inquisition]]. Spanish Inquisitors viewed witchcraft as a problem that could be cured simply through confession. Yet, as anthropologist [[Ruth Behar]] writes, witchcraft, not only in Mexico but in Latin America in general, was a "conjecture of sexuality, witchcraft, and religion, in which Spanish, indigenous, and African cultures converged."&lt;ref&gt;Behar, Ruth. ''Sex and Sin, Witchcraft and the Devil in Late-Colonial Mexico.'' American Ethnologist, 14:1 (February 1987), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, witchcraft in Mexico generally required an interethnic and interclass network of witches.&lt;ref&gt;Lavrin, Asunción. ''Sexuality &amp; Marriage in Colonial Latin America.'' Reprint ed. Lincoln, NB.:University of Nebraska Press, 1992, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, according to anthropology professor Laura Lewis, witchcraft in colonial Mexico ultimately represented an "affirmation of hegemony" for women, Indians, and especially Indian women over their white male counterparts as a result of the [[casta]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Laura A. ''Hall of mirrors: power, witchcraft, and caste in colonial Mexico.'' Durham, N.C.:Duke University Press, 2003, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern history, notoriety has been awarded to a place called [[Catemaco#The "witches" of Catemaco|Catemaco]], in the state of Veracruz, which has a history of witchcraft, and where the practice of witchcraft by contemporary ''brujos'' and ''brujas'' thrives.

In Mexico City, people who practice brujería, [[Santería]], voodoo, ocultism and magic may find items, herbs and supplies at the ''[[mercado de Sonora]]''.

==== South America ====
In [[Chile]] there is a tradition of the [[Kalku]] in [[Mapuche religion]]; and the [[Warlock of Chiloé|Warlocks of Chiloé]] in the folklore and [[Chilote mythology]].

The presence of the witch is a constant in the [[ethnographic]] [[history]] of [[colonial Brazil]], especially during the several denunciations and confessions given to the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] of [[Bahia]] (1591–1593), [[Pernambuco]] and [[Paraíba]] (1593–1595).&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} João Ribeiro Júnior, ''O Que é Magia'', p.48-49, Ed.

Apart from other types of [[Violence against women]] in [[Nepal]], the malpractice of abusing women in the name of witchcraft is also really prominent. According to the statistics in 2013, there was a total of 69 reported cases of abuse to women due to accusation of performing witchcraft.

==== Japan ====
[[File:Okabe - The cat witch.jpg|thumb|Okabe – The cat witch, by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]]]]

In Japanese folklore, the most common types of witch can be separated into two categories: those who employ [[snake]]s as familiars, and those who employ foxes.&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, Carmen. The Catalpa Bow : A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan. New York: Routledge Curzon, 1999. 51–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fox witch is, by far, the most commonly seen witch figure in Japan. Differing regional beliefs set those who use foxes into two separate types: the ''kitsune-mochi'', and the ''tsukimono-suji''. The first of these, the ''kitsune-mochi'', is a solitary figure who gains his fox familiar by bribing it with its favourite foods. The ''kitsune-mochi'' then strikes up a deal with the fox, typically promising food and daily care in return for the fox's magical services. The fox of Japanese folklore is a powerful trickster in and of itself, imbued with powers of shape changing, possession, and illusion. These creatures can be either nefarious; disguising themselves as women in order to trap men, or they can be benign forces as in the story of "The Grateful foxes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academia.issendai.com/foxtales/japan-grateful-foxes.shtml |title=The Grateful Foxes – Japanese foxtales |publisher=Academia.issendai.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once a fox enters the employ of a human it almost exclusively becomes a force of evil to be feared. A fox under the employ of a human can provide many services. The fox can turn invisible and find secrets its master desires. It can apply its many powers of illusion to trick and deceive its master's enemies. The most feared power of the ''kitsune-mochi'' is the ability to command his fox to possess other humans. This process of possession is called [[Kitsunetsuki]].

By far, the most commonly reported cases of fox witchcraft in modern Japan are enacted by ''tsukimono-suji'' families, or "hereditary witches".&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, Carmen ''Catalpa Bow'' p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tsukimono-suji'' is traditionally a family who is reported to have foxes under their employ. These foxes serve the family and are passed down through the generations, typically through the female line. ''Tsukimono-suji'' foxes are able to supply much in the way of the same mystical aid that the foxes under the employ of a ''kitsune-mochi'' can provide its more solitary master with. In addition to these powers, if the foxes are kept happy and well taken care of, they bring great fortune and prosperity to the ''Tsukimono-suji'' house. However, the aid in which these foxes give is often overshadowed by the social and mystical implications of being a member of such a family. In many villages, the status of local families as ''tsukimono-suji'' is often common, everyday knowledge. Such families are respected and feared, but are also openly shunned. Due to its hereditary nature, the status of being ''Tsukimono-suji'' is considered contagious. Because of this, it is often impossible for members of such a family to sell land or other properties, due to fear that the possession of such items will cause foxes to inundate one's own home. In addition to this, because the foxes are believed to be passed down through the female line, it is often nearly impossible for women of such families to find a husband whose family will agree to have him married to a ''tsukimono-suji'' family. In such a union the woman's status as a ''Tsukimono-suji'' would transfer to any man who married her.

==== Philippines ====
Witchcraft in [[the Philippines]] is often classified as malevolent, with practitioners of black magic called ''[[Mangkukulam]]'' in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and ''[[Mambabarang]]'' in [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]; there are also practitioners of benevolent, white magic, in addition to some who practise both. ''Mambabarang'' in particular are noted for their ability to command insects and other invertebrates to accomplish a task, such as delivering a curse to a target.

Magic and witchcraft in the Philippines varies considerably across the different [[Ethnic groups of the Philippines|ethnic groups]], and is commonly a modern manifestation of [[History of the Philippines (900-1521)|pre-Colonial]] spirituality interwoven with [[Catholicism in the Philippines|Catholic]] religious elements such as the invocation of [[saints]] and the use of [[pseudo-Latin]] prayers (''oración'') in spells, and ''[[anting-anting]]'' (amulets).

Practitioners of traditional herbal-based medicine and divination called ''[[albularyo]]'' are not considered witches. They are perceived to be either quack doctors or a quasi-magical option when western medicine fails to identify or cure an ailment that is thus suspected to be of supernatural, often malevolent, origin. [[Feng shui]], an influence of [[Filipino Chinese]] culture, is also not classified as witchcraft as it is considered a separate realm of belief altogether.

[[File:Die Hexe (Albrecht Dürer).jpg|thumb|left|[[Albrecht Dürer]] circa 1500: Witch Riding Backwards On A Goat]]
[[File:Sejdmen.jpg|thumb|During the Christianisation of Norway, King [[Olaf Trygvasson]] had male [[völva]]s (shamans) tied up and left on a [[skerry]] at [[tide|ebb]].]]Witchcraft in Europe between 500–1750 was believed to be a combination of sorcery and heresy. While sorcery attempts to produce negative supernatural effects through formulas and rituals, heresy is the Christian contribution to witchcraft in which an individual makes a pact with the Devil. In addition, heresy denies witches the recognition of important Christian values such as baptism, salvation, Christ and sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=European Witchcraft|last=Monter|first=E. William|year=1969|isbn=|location=New York|pages=vii–viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the witch accusations in Europe took place in the 14th and 15th centuries; however as the social disruptions of the 16th century took place, witchcraft trials intensified.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite book|title=European Witch Trials: Their Foundations in Popular and Learned Culture, 1300–1500|last=Kiekhefer|first=Richard|publisher=Routledge|year=201|isbn=|location=|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Persecution of witches.jpg|thumb|[[Death by burning|Burning]] of witches.  Current scholarly estimates of the number of people executed for witchcraft vary between about 40,000 and 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Brian P. Levack]] (''The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe'') multiplied the number of known European witch trials by the average rate of conviction and execution, to arrive at a figure of around 60,000 deaths. [[Anne Lewellyn Barstow]] (''Witchcraze'') adjusted Levack's estimate to account for lost records, estimating 100,000 deaths. [[Ronald Hutton]] (''Triumph of the Moon'') argues that Levack's estimate had already been adjusted for these, and revises the figure to approximately 40,000.&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of witch trials in Europe known for certain to have ended in executions is around 12,000.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title = Estimates of executions | url=http://www.summerlands.com/crossroads/remembrance/current.htm }} Based on [[Ronald Hutton]]'s essay ''Counting the Witch Hunt''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In Early Modern European tradition, witches were stereotypically, though not exclusively, women.&lt;ref name="gibbons"&gt;Gibbons, Jenny (1998) "Recent Developments in the Study of the Great European Witch Hunt" in [http://www.equinoxjournals.com/ojs/index.php/POM ''The Pomegranate''] #5, Lammas 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Nevill (1992) ''Dictionary of Mysticism and the Esoteric Traditions'' Revised Edition. Bridport, Dorset: Prism Press. "Witch".&lt;/ref&gt; European pagan belief in witchcraft was associated with the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and dismissed as "diabolical fantasies" by medieval Christian authors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Regino of Prüm]] (906), see Ginzburg (1990) part 2, ch. 1 (89ff.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Witch-hunt]]s first appeared in large numbers in southern France and Switzerland during the 14th and 15th centuries. The peak years of witch-hunts in southwest [[Germany]] were from 1561 to 1670.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. [[Erik Midelfort]], Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany 1562–1684, 1972,71&lt;/ref&gt;

It was commonly believed that individuals with power and prestige were involved in acts of witchcraft and even cannibalism.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Thornton, John. "Cannibals, Witches, and Slave Traders in the Atlantic World." The William and Mary Quarterly 60, no. 2 (2003): 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Europe had a lot of power over individuals living in West Africa, Europeans in positions of power were often accused of taking part in these practices. Though it is not likely that these individuals were actually involved in these practices, they were most likely associated due to Europe’s involvement in things like the slave trade, which negatively affected the lives of many individuals in the Atlantic World throughout the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The familiar witch of [[folklore]] and popular [[superstition]] is a combination of numerous influences. The characterization of the witch as an evil magic user developed over time.

Early converts to Christianity looked to Christian clergy to work magic more effectively than the old methods under Roman paganism, and Christianity provided a methodology involving saints and relics, similar to the gods and amulets of the Pagan world. As Christianity became the dominant religion in Europe, its concern with magic lessened.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell-Stuart, P. G. (2000) "The Emergence of the Christian Witch" in ''History Today'', Nov, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protestant Christian explanation for witchcraft, such as those typified in the confessions of the [[Pendle witches]], commonly involves a [[deal with the Devil|diabolical pact]] or at least an appeal to the intervention of the spirits of evil. The witches or wizards engaged in such practices were alleged to reject [[Jesus]] and the [[sacrament]]s; observe "[[Witches' Sabbath|the witches' sabbath]]" (performing infernal rites that often parodied the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or other sacraments of the Church); pay Divine honour to [[Satan|the Prince of Darkness]]; and, in return, receive from him [[preternatural]] powers. It was a folkloric belief that a Devil's Mark, like the brand on cattle, was placed upon a witch's skin by the devil to signify that this pact had been made.&lt;ref&gt;Drymon, M.M. Disguised as the Devil: How Lyme Disease Created Witches and Changed History, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Witches were most often characterized as women. Witches disrupted the societal institutions, and more specifically, marriage. It was believed that a witch often joined a pact with the devil to gain powers to deal with infertility, immense fear for her children's well-being, or revenge against a lover. They were also depicted as lustful and perverted, and it was thought that they copulated with the devil at the Sabbath.

The Church and European society were not always so zealous in hunting witches or blaming them for misfortunes. [[Saint Boniface]] declared in the 8th century that belief in the existence of witches was un-Christian. The emperor [[Charlemagne]] decreed that the burning of supposed witches was a pagan custom that would be punished by the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]]. In 820 the [[Bishop of Lyon]] and others repudiated the belief that witches could make bad weather, fly in the night, and change their shape. This denial was accepted into [[Canon law]] . Other rulers such as [[Coloman, King of Hungary|King Coloman of Hungary]] declared that witch-hunts should cease because witches (more specifically, [[strigoi|strigas]]) do not exist.
[[File:Torturing and execution of witches in medieval miniature.jpg|thumb|Burning witches, with others held in Stocks, 14th century]]
The Church did not invent the idea of witchcraft as a potentially harmful force whose practitioners should be put to death. This idea is commonplace in pre-Christian religions. According to the scholar Max Dashu, the concept of medieval witchcraft contained many of its elements even before the emergence of Christianity. These can be found in [[Bacchanalia]]s, especially in the time when they were led by priestess [[Paculla Annia]] (188BC–186BC).

Powers typically attributed to European witches include turning food poisonous or inedible, flying on broomsticks or pitchforks, casting spells, cursing people, making livestock ill and crops fail, and creating fear and local chaos.

However, even at a later date, not all witches were assumed to be harmful practicers of the craft. In England, the provision of this curative magic was the job of a [[witch doctor]], also known as a [[cunning folk|cunning man]], [[white witch]], or wise man. The term "witch doctor" was in use in England before it came to be associated with Africa. [[Toad doctors]] were also credited with the ability to undo evil witchcraft. (Other folk magicians had their own purviews. [[Girdle-measurers]] specialised in diagnosing ailments caused by fairies, while magical cures for more mundane ailments, such as burns or toothache, could be had from [[Charmer (folklore)|charmer]]s.)

Historians [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]] and his student [[Alan Macfarlane]] study witchcraft by combining historical research with concepts drawn from anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Thomas, ''Religion and the Decline of Magic'' (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Barry, "Introduction: Keith Thomas and the problem of witchcraft" in  Jonathan Barry et al. eds., ''Witchcraft in early modern Europe: Studies in Culture and Belief'' (1996)  pp. 1–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Macfarlane, ''Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: A Regional and Comparative Study'' (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that English witchcraft, like African witchcraft, was endemic rather than epidemic. Older women were the favorite targets because they were marginal, dependent members of the community and therefore more likely to arouse feelings of both hostility and guilt, and less likely to have defenders of importance inside the community. Witchcraft accusations were the village's reaction to the breakdown of its internal community, coupled with the emergence of a newer set of values that was generating psychic stress.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke Garrett, ""Women and witches: Patterns of analysis."

In Wales,  fear of witchcraft mounted around the year 1500.  There was a growing alarm of women's magic as a weapon aimed against the state and church. The Church made greater efforts to enforce the canon law of marriage, especially in Wales where tradition allowed a wider range of sexual partnerships. There was a political dimension as well, as accusations of witchcraft were levied against the enemies of Henry VII, who was exerting more and more control over Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Kamerick, "Tanglost of Wales: Magic and Adultery in the Court of Chancery circa 1500." ''Sixteenth Century Journal'' 44#1 (2013) pp25-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The records of the Courts of Great Sessions for Wales, 1536–1736 show that Welsh custom was more important than English law. Custom provided a framework of responding to witches and witchcraft in such a way that interpersonal and communal harmony was maintained, Showing to regard to the importance of honour, social place and cultural status. Even when found guilty, execution did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Parkin, "Witchcraft, women's honour and customary law in early modern Wales." ''Social History'' 31.3 (2006): 295–318.&lt;/ref&gt;

Becoming king in 1603,  [[James I]] Brought to England and Scotland continental explanations of witchcraft. His goal was to divert suspicion away from male [[homosociality]] among the elite, and focus fear on female communities and large gatherings of women. He thought they threatened his political power so he laid the foundation for witchcraft and occultism policies, especially in Scotland. The point was that a widespread belief in the conspiracy of witches and a witches' Sabbath with the devil deprived women of political influence. Occult power was supposedly a womanly trait because women were weaker and more susceptible to the devil.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lolis, "The City of Witches: James I, the Unholy Sabbath, and the Homosocial Refashioning of the Witches’ Community."

In the [[United Kingdom]] children believed to be witches or seen as possessed by evil spirits can be subject to severe beatings, traumatic [[exorcism]], and/or other abuse.  There have even been child murders associated with witchcraft beliefs.

In pre-Christian times, witchcraft was a common practice in the [[Cook Islands]]. The native name for a sorcerer was ''tangata purepure'' (a man who prays).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Buse|date=1995|title=Cook Islands Maori Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;pg=PA372|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Education|page=372|isbn=9780728602304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prayers offered by the ''ta'unga'' (priests)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Buse|date=1995|title=Cook Islands Maori Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;pg=PA471|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Education|page=471|isbn=9780728602304}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the gods worshiped on national or tribal ''[[marae]]'' (temples) were termed ''karakia'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Buse|date=1995|title=Cook Islands Maori Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;pg=PA156|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Education|page=156|isbn=9780728602304}}&lt;/ref&gt; those on minor occasions to the lesser gods were named ''pure''. All these prayers were metrical, and were handed down from generation to generation with the utmost care. There were prayers for every such phase in life; for success in battle; for a change in wind (to overwhelm an adversary at sea, or that an intended voyage be propitious); that his crops may grow; to curse a thief; or wish ill-luck and death to his foes. Few men of middle age were without a number of these prayers or charms. The succession of a sorcerer was from father to son, or from uncle to nephew. So too of sorceresses: it would be from mother to daughter, or from aunt to niece. Sorcerers and sorceresses were often slain by relatives of their supposed victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Wyatt Gill|author-link=William Wyatt Gill|date=1892|title=The south Pacific and New Guinea, past and present; with notes on the Hervey group, an illustrative song and various myths|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/southpacificnewg00gill#page/20/mode/2up|chapter=Wizards|publisher=Sydney: Charles Potter, Government Printer|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A singular enchantment was employed to kill off a husband of a pretty woman desired by someone else. The expanded flower of a [[Gardenia taitensis|Gardenia]] was stuck upright—a very difficult performance—in a cup (i.e., half a large coconut shell) of water. A prayer was then offered for the husbands speedy death, the sorcerer earnestly watching the flower. Should it fall the incantation was successful. But if the flower still remained upright, he will live. The sorcerer would in that case try his skill another day, with perhaps better success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Wyatt Gill|date=1892|title=The south Pacific and New Guinea, past and present; with notes on the Hervey group, an illustrative song and various myths|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/southpacificnewg00gill#page/20/mode/2up|chapter=Wizards|publisher=Sydney: Charles Potter, Government Printer|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Beatrice Grimshaw]], a journalist who visited the Cook Islands in 1907, the uncrowned [[Makea Takau Ariki|Queen Makea]] was believed to have possessed the mystic power called ''[[mana]]'',  giving the possessor the power to slay at will.

=== Russia ===
Among the [[Russian language|Russian]] words for ''witch'', ведьма (ved'ma) literally means "one who knows", from Old Slavic вѣдъ "to know").&lt;ref&gt;See also Ryan, W.F. ''The Bathhouse at Midnight: An Historical Survey of Magic and Divination in Russia'', [[Pennsylvania State University Press]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Another frequent term is колдунья (koldun'ya), ''sorcerer'' being колдун (koldun).

==== Spells ====
Pagan practices formed a part of Russian and Eastern Slavic culture; the Russian people were deeply superstitious. The witchcraft practiced consisted mostly of earth magic and herbology; it was not so significant which herbs were used in practices, but how these herbs were gathered. Ritual centered on harvest of the crops and the location of the sun was very important.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 524.
&lt;/ref&gt;  One source, pagan author Judika Illes, tells that herbs picked on Midsummer's Eve were believed to be most powerful, especially if gathered on Bald Mountain near Kiev during the witches' annual revels celebration.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004,) page 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Botanicals should be gathered, "During the seventeenth minute of the fourteenth hour, under a dark moon, in the thirteenth field, wearing a red dress, pick the twelfth flower on the right."&lt;ref name="Judika Illes 2004 page 847"&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 847.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spells also served for midwifery, shape-shifting, keeping lovers faithful, and bridal customs. Spells dealing with midwifery and childbirth focused on the spiritual wellbeing of the baby.&lt;ref name="Judika Illes 2004 page 847"/&gt;  Shape-shifting spells involved invocation of the wolf as a spirit animal.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 623.&lt;/ref&gt; To keep men faithful, lovers would cut a ribbon the length of his erect penis and soak it in his seminal emissions after sex while he was sleeping, then tie seven knots in it; keeping this talisman of knot magic ensured loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 797.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of an ancient pagan marriage tradition involved the bride taking a ritual bath at a bathhouse before the ceremony. Her sweat would be wiped from her body using raw fish, and the fish would be cooked and fed to the groom.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 705.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demonism, or black magic, was not prevalent. Persecution for witchcraft, mostly involved the practice of simple earth magic, founded on herbology, by solitary practitioners with a Christian influence. In one case investigators found a locked box containing something bundled in a kerchief and three paper packets, wrapped and tied, containing crushed grasses.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3879463|title=Male Witches and Gendered Categories in Seventeenth-Century Russia|first=Valerie A.|last=Kivelson|date=1 January 2003|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=45|issue=3|pages=606–631}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most rituals of witchcraft were very simple—one spell of divination consists of sitting alone outside meditating, asking the earth to show one's fate.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

While these customs were unique to Russian culture, they were not exclusive to this region. Russian pagan practices were often akin to paganism in other parts of the world. The Chinese concept of ''chi'', a form of energy that often manipulated in witchcraft, is known as bioplasma in Russian practices.&lt;ref&gt;Janet and Stewart Farrar, A Witches Bible: The Complete Witches' Handbook (Washington, Phoenix Publishing, Inc.) 1984. Page 316.
&lt;/ref&gt;  The western concept of an "evil eye" or a "hex" was translated to Russia as a "spoiler".&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 586.&lt;/ref&gt; A spoiler was rooted in envy, jealousy and malice. Spoilers could be made by gathering bone from a cemetery, a knot of the target's hair, burned wooden splinters and several herb Paris berries (which are very poisonous). Placing these items in sachet in the victim's pillow completes a spoiler.  The Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and the ancient Egyptians recognized the evil eye from as early as 3,000 BCE; in Russian practices it is seen as a sixteenth-century concept.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Buckland, The Witch Book: The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft, Wicca, and Neo-Paganism (Detroit: Visible Ink) 2002. Page 160.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Societal view of witchcraft ====
The dominant societal concern those practicing witchcraft was not whether paganism was effective, but whether it could cause harm.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;  Peasants in Russian and Ukrainian societies often shunned witchcraft, unless they needed help against supernatural forces. Impotence, stomach pains, barrenness, hernias, abscesses, epileptic seizures, and convulsions were all attributed to evil (or witchcraft). This is reflected in linguistics; there are numerous words for a variety of practitioners of paganism-based healers. Russian peasants referred to a witch as a ''chernoknizhnik'' (a person who plied his trade with the aid of a black book), ''sheptun''/''sheptun'ia'' (a "whisperer" male or female), ''lekar''/''lekarka'' or ''znakhar''/''znakharka'' (a male or female healer), or ''zagovornik'' (an incanter).&lt;ref&gt;
Christine D. Worobec, 1995. "Witchcraft Beliefs and Practices in Prerevolutionary Russian and Ukrainian Villages." Russian Review 54, no. 2: 165. Historical Abstracts, EBSCOhost (accessed November 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically enough, there was universal reliance on folk healers – but clients often turned them in if something went wrong. According to Russian historian Valerie A. Kivelson, witchcraft accusations were normally thrown at lower-class peasants, townspeople and Cossacks. People turned to witchcraft as a means to support themselves. The ratio of male to female accusations was 75% to 25%. Males were targeted more, because witchcraft was associated with societal deviation. Because single people with no settled home could not be taxed, males typically had more power than women in their dissent.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

The history of Witchcraft had evolved around society. More of a psychological concept to the creation and usage of Witchcraft can create the assumption as to why women are more likely to follow the practices behind Witchcraft. Identifying with the soul of an individual’s self is often deemed as "feminine" in society. There is analyzed social and economic evidence to associate between witchcraft and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Mark|title=Damned Women: Sinners and Witches in Puritan New England|journal=ProQuest|date=1998|volume=67|issue= 1|pages=192–194|doi=10.2307/3170836|jstor=3170836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Witchcraft trials ====
[[File:"A true and just recorde of the information"; title page Wellcome M0012987.jpg|thumb|''A true and iust Recorde, of the Information, Examination and Confession of all witches...'']]

Witchcraft trials occurred frequently in seventeenth-century Russia, although the "great witch-hunt" is believed{{by whom|date=January 2014}} to be a predominately Western European phenomenon.  However, as the witchcraft-trial craze swept across Catholic and Protestant countries during this time, Orthodox Christian Europe indeed partook in this so-called "witch hysteria."  This involved the persecution of both males and females who were believed to be practicing paganism, herbology, the black art, or a form of sorcery within and/or outside their community.  Very early on witchcraft legally fell under the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical body, the church, in Kievan Rus' and Muscovite Russia.&lt;ref&gt;
Russell Zguta, "Witchcraft Trials in Seventeenth-Century Russia," American Historical Review 82, no. 5 (December 1977), 1190.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sources of ecclesiastical witchcraft jurisdiction date back as early as the second half of the eleventh century, one being [[Vladimir the Great]]'s first edition of his State Statute or ''Ustav'', another being multiple references in the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' beginning in 1024.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1190.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nothing could be done about it LACMA 63.11.24.jpg|thumb|Goya's drawing of result of a presumed witch's trial: " [so she must be a witch]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Inquisition Unmasked: Being an Historical and Philosophical Account of that Tremendous Tribunal, Founded on Authentic Documents; and Exhibiting the Necessity of Its Suppression, as a Means of Reform and Regeneration, Written and Published at a Time when the National Congress of Spain was about to Deliberate on this Important Measure|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aqRCAAAAYAAJ|publisher = Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy|date = 1816-01-01|first = Antonio|last = Puigblanch}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The sentence for an individual found guilty of witchcraft or sorcery during this time, and in previous centuries, typically included either burning at the stake or being tested with the "ordeal of cold water" or ''judicium aquae frigidae''.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1189"&gt;Zguta, 1189.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cold-water test was primarily a Western European phenomenon, but was used as a method of truth in Russia prior to, and post, seventeenth-century witchcraft trials in Muscovy.  Accused persons who submerged were considered innocent, and ecclesiastical authorities would proclaim them "brought back," but those who floated were considered guilty of practicing witchcraft, and burned at the stake or executed in an unholy fashion. The thirteenth-century bishop of Vladimir, Serapion Vladimirskii, preached sermons throughout the Muscovite countryside, and in one particular sermon revealed that burning was the usual punishment for witchcraft, but more often the cold water test was used as a precursor to execution.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1189"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/brewers/cold-water-ordeal.html|title=Cold Water Ordeal|website=Infoplease.com|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these two methods of torture were used in the west and the east, Russia implemented a system of fines payable for the crime of witchcraft during the seventeenth century.  Thus, even though torture methods in Muscovy were on a similar level of harshness as Western European methods used, a more civil method was present.  In the introduction of a collection of trial records pieced together by Russian scholar Nikolai Novombergsk, he argues that Muscovite authorities used the same degree of cruelty and harshness as Western European Catholic and Protestant countries in persecuting witches.&lt;ref&gt;
Zguta, 1187.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the mid-sixteenth century the manifestations of paganism, including witchcraft, and the black arts—astrology, fortune telling, and divination—became a serious concern to the Muscovite church and state.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1191"&gt;Zguta, 1191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsar [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] (reigned 1547–1584) took this matter to the ecclesiastical court and was immediately advised that individuals practicing these forms of witchcraft should be excommunicated and given the death penalty.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1191"/&gt;  Ivan IV, as a true believer in witchcraft, was deeply convinced{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} that sorcery accounted for the death of his wife, [[Anastasia Romanovna|Anastasiia]] in 1560, which completely devastated and depressed him, leaving him heartbroken.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stemming from this belief, Ivan IV became majorly concerned with the threat of witchcraft harming his family, and feared he was in danger. So, during the [[Oprichnina]] (1565–1572), Ivan IV succeeded in accusing and charging a good number of boyars with witchcraft whom he did not wish to remain as nobles.  Rulers after Ivan IV, specifically during the [[Time of Troubles]] (1598–1613), increased the fear of witchcraft among themselves and entire royal families, which then led to further preoccupation with the fear of prominent Muscovite witchcraft circles.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1193–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Time of Troubles, seventeenth-century Muscovite rulers held frequent investigations of witchcraft within their households, laying the ground, along with previous tsarist reforms, for widespread witchcraft trials throughout the Muscovite state.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1195.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1622 and 1700 ninety-one people were brought to trial in Muscovite courts for witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1196.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Russia did partake in the witch craze that swept across Western Europe, the Muscovite state did not persecute nearly as many people for witchcraft, let alone execute a number of individuals anywhere close to the number executed in the west during the witch hysteria.

== Witches in art ==
Witches have a long history of being depicted in art, although most of their earliest artistic depictions seem to originate in Early Modern Europe, particularly the Medieval and Renaissance periods. Many scholars attribute their manifestation in art as inspired by texts such as ''Canon Episcopi'', a demonology-centered work of literature, and ''Malleus Maleficarum'', a "witch-craze" manual published in 1487, by Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Patricia. "THE INCUBUS AND ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART." Source: ''Notes in the History of Art'' 34.1 (2014): 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Canon Episcopi'', a ninth-century text that explored the subject of demonology, initially introduced concepts that would continuously be associated with witches, such as their ability to fly or their believed fornication and sexual relations with the devil. The text refers to two women, Diana the Huntress and Herodias, who both express the duality of female sorcerers. Diana was described as having a heavenly body and as the "protectress of childbirth and fertility" while Herodias symbolized "unbridled sensuality". They thus represent the mental powers and cunning sexuality that witches used as weapons to trick men into performing sinful acts which would result in their eternal punishment. These characteristics were distinguished as Medusa-like or Lamia-like traits when seen in any artwork (Medusa's mental trickery was associated with Diana the Huntress's psychic powers and Lamia was a rumored female figure in the Medieval ages sometimes used in place of Herodias).&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzi, Lorenzo. ''Witches. Exploring the iconography of the sorceress and enchantress''. (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
   
One of the first individuals to regularly depict witches after the witch-craze of the medieval period was [[Albrecht Dürer]], a German Renaissance artist. His famous 1497 engraving ''[[The Four Witches]]'', portrays four physically attractive and seductive nude witches. Their supernatural identities are emphasized by the skulls and bones lying at their feet as well as the devil discreetly peering at them from their left. The women's sensuous presentation speaks to the overtly sexual nature they were attached to in early modern Europe. Moreover, this attractiveness was perceived as a danger to ordinary men who they could seduce and tempt into their sinful world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some scholars interpret this piece as utilizing the logic of the ''Canon Episcopi'', in which women used their mental powers and bodily seduction to enslave and lead men onto a path of eternal damnation, differing from the unattractive depiction of witches that would follow in later Renaissance years.&lt;ref&gt;Stumpel, Jeroen. “The Foul Fowler Found out: On a Key Motif in Dürer's ‘Four Witches.’” Simiolus: ''Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', vol. 30, no. 3/4, 2003, pp. 143–160., www.jstor.org/stable/3780914.&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Dürer also employed other ideas from the Middle Ages that were commonly associated with witches. Specifically, his art often referred to former 12th- to 13th-century Medieval iconography addressing the nature of female sorcerers. In the Medieval period, there was a widespread fear of witches, accordingly producing an association of dark, intimidating characteristics with witches, such as cannibalism (witches described as "[sucking] the blood of newborn infants"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) or described as having the ability to fly, usually on the back of black goats. As the Renaissance period began, these concepts of witchcraft were suppressed, leading to a drastic change in the sorceress' appearances, from sexually explicit beings to the 'ordinary' typical housewives of this time period. This depiction, known as the 'Waldensian' witch became a cultural phenomenon of early Renaissance art. The term originates from the 12th-century monk Peter Waldo, who established his own religious sect which explicitly opposed the luxury and commodity-influenced lifestyle of the Christian church clergy, and whose sect was excommunicated before being persecuted as "practitioners of witchcraft and magic".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Subsequent artwork exhibiting witches tended to consistently rely on cultural stereotypes about these women. These stereotypes were usually rooted in early Renaissance religious discourse, specifically the Christian belief that an "earthly alliance" had taken place between Satan's female minions who "conspired to destroy Christendom".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Hoak, Dale. "THE EUROPEAN WITCHCRAZE REVISITED, PT 2, WITCH-HUNTING AND WOMEN IN THE ART OF THE RENAISSANCE." ''History Today'' 31.FEB (1981): 22–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant artist whose art consistently depicted witches was Dürer's apprentice, Hans Baldung Grien, a 15th-century German artist. His chiaroscuro woodcut, ''Witches'', created in 1510, visually encompassed all the characteristics that were regularly assigned to witches during the Renaissance. Social beliefs labeled witches as supernatural beings capable of doing great harm, possessing the ability to fly, and as cannibalistic.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The urn in ''Witches'' seems to contain pieces of the human body, which the witches are seen consuming as a source of energy. Meanwhile, their nudity while feasting is recognized as an allusion to their sexual appetite, and some scholars read the witch riding on the back of a goat-demon as representative of their "flight-inducing [powers]". This connection between women's sexual nature and sins was thematic in the pieces of many Renaissance artists, especially Christian artists, due to cultural beliefs which characterized women as overtly sexual beings who were less capable (in comparison to men) of resisting sinful temptation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
