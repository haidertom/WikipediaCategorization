      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7521">'''!Wowow!''' is a [[artist collective|collective]] in [[Peckham]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radnofsky|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise known as '''The Children of !Wowow!''', they are a group of artists, fashion designers, writers and musicians, who have promoted numerous art events and parties in London and Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

!Wowow! began in the back of the Joiners Arms in [[Camberwell]] in 2003 as a performance night in a pub by Hanna Hanra and [[Matthew Stone]]. In 2004, the collective squatted a large [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] co-op in Peckham South East London and made it into an [[artist-run space]]. They include fashion designer [[Gareth Pugh]],&lt;ref name=timeout&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[performance art]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ist [[List of The Bill characters (A–D)#Millie Brown|Millie Brown]], video installation artist [[Adham Faramawy]], James Balmforth and artist [[Matthew Stone]]. Other artists to have shown in the space include [[Boo Saville]], Gareth Cadwallader, and Ellie Tobin.&lt;ref name=watkins&gt;{{harvnb|Watkins|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, !Wowow! organised warehouse parties in [[Peckham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knight|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times club nights with 2000 people took place.&lt;ref name=timeout/&gt; One of these was attended by [[Lauren Bush]], the former U.S. President's niece, and her two [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] bodyguards.&lt;ref name=timeout/&gt;

The second show by the collective in December 2004 was of paintings, film, photography and performance by recent [[Slade School of Fine Art|Slade]] graduates for a month in the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] building at 251 Rye Lane, Peckham, formerly occupied by the [[The Co-operative Group|Co-op]] shop, which the artists gutted and refurbished.&lt;ref name=hoggard&gt;{{harvnb|Hoggard|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artists, who curated the exhibition together, included [[Chloe Dewe Mathews]] with photographs of [[lido]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[Matthew Stone]] with digital recreations of old paintings, Rachael Haines with surrealist inspired collages and Boo Saville with monkey paintings and [[Ballpoint pen|biro]] drawings.&lt;ref name=hoggard/&gt; The opening featured [[shamanism|shamanistic]] chanting, a shopping Trolley Mardi Gras, live bands and a recreation of [[Michael Jackson]]'s video [[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|''Thriller'']] by [[Performance art|performance]] artist [[Marvin Gaye Chetwynd|Lali Chetwynd]]'s troupe.&lt;ref name=hoggard/&gt;

In November 2005, the Children of !Wowow! organised a week-long event in a large warehouse in Peckham, curated by member Gareth Cadwallader, and in a number of smaller venues in the area, featuring members of the collective and also [[Mark McGowan (performance artist)|Mark McGowan]].&lt;ref name=watkins/&gt; Events included ''Stolen Cinema'' with cult films from a local rental shop, Richard Elms' play ''Factory Dog'', and a ''Greasy Spoon Art Salon Breakfast'' presided over by Lali Chetwynd and Zoe Brown.&lt;ref name=watkins/&gt; he week culminated with a party for 1,500 people, with 10,000 bottles of beer, 500 bottles of [[whisky|whiskey]], and 13 live bands on stage. The bands included The So Silage Crew, Ludes, The Long Blondes, and Ivich Lives.&lt;ref name=watkins/&gt;

The Amazing squat created its own "distinctly odd harlequin-esque fashion style", through Gareth Pughs' participation.&lt;ref name=timeout/&gt; Hanna Hanra and Katie Shillingford edited ''Fashion/ Art/ Leisure'', a fanzine affiliated with the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2006a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matthew Stone]] said:
{{quote|text=It was an opportunity to invest in what we believed in, rather than chipping off bits of our soul working as unpaid interns. The practicalities of not having to work meant that we could be playful with what we did, but some serious ideas came out of that ridiculous house.&lt;ref name=timeout/&gt;}}

Since the Imperials left their original building in 2006, they have organised events in Dresden and also squatted a Kwik Fit Garage in Camberwell for an exhibition. Millie Brown and [[Adham Faramawy]] have organised several art and music events. These have included an event in March 2007 in Birmingham. Along with the original group, several other artists and performers exhibited, including [[Theo Adams]], [[Ben Schumacher]], [[Lennie Lee]], and Fayann Smith.

'''''Algol''''' was an [[avant-garde]] Catalan magazine edited by the artistic group [[Dau al Set]] and first published in 1947. It was founded by [[Joan Pons]] and [[Joan Brossa]] and edited by [[Enric Tomo i Freixes]]. Only 100 copies of ''Algol'' were published. The 12-page magazine was printed on [[guarro]], a type of linen paper.{{clarify|date=February 2014}}

[[Dau al Set]] was formed by the poet Joan Brossa, the philosopher [[Arnau Puig]] and the painters Joan Pons, [[Antoni Tàpies]], [[Modest Cuixart]] and [[Joan-Josep Tharrats]]. It was a very important group in the Spanish post-war era.&lt;ref name=enc&gt;[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/enciclop%C3%A8dies/gran-enciclop%C3%A8dia-catalana/EC-GEC-0021566.xml?s.q=dau+al+set#.UwHjbWJ5P7B Gran Enciclopèdia Catalana]&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine included literary texts by Brossa and Puig and illustrations by Pons, [[Jordi Mercadé]] and [[Francesc Boadella]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdc2.cbuc.cat/cdm/ref/collection/algol/id/0 Descripció]&lt;/ref&gt;

The group later published another magazine, called ''[[Dau al Set]]'' after their own name, which was the sequel to ''Algol''. ''Dau al Set'' was first published in 1948 and had a total of 56 pages. It also contained works by Brossa, Puig, and many other artists.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

'''Antediluvian Rocking Horse''' (formed 1994 [[St Kilda, Victoria|St. Kilda, Australia]]) is an audio project maintained by two core artists credited as DJ2 and DJ3. DJ2 is Paul Wain, a sculptor and graduate of the [[Victorian College of the Arts]]. DJ3 is Susan King, a [[collage]] artist, writer and [[Anti-copyright]] advocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.some-assembly-required.net/blog/2006/01/january-16-2006-antediluvian-rocking.html |title=Some Assembly Required: January&amp;nbsp;16, 2006: Antediluvian Rocking Horse |publisher=Some-assembly-required.net |author=Jaydreams |date=16 January 2006 |accessdate=11 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512144950/http://www.some-assembly-required.net/blog/2006/01/january-16-2006-antediluvian-rocking.html |archivedate=12 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Composer [[Ollie Olsen]] is also a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Antediluvian+Rocking+Horse |title=Antediluvian Rocking Horse |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=11 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012132613/http://www.discogs.com/artist/Antediluvian%2BRocking%2BHorse |archivedate=12 October 2008 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project produces music and soundscapes that are entirely recycled from other recorded works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://detritus.net/detrivores.html |title=Cultural Workers at Detritus.net |publisher=Detritus.net |date= |accessdate=11 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-copyright==
Copyright is an unambiguous focus for the project. Its work in multi-source soundscapes and ambient [[mashup (music)|mashup]] is informed by [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]] and wilful [[detournement]]. Like [[The Evolution Control Committee]] with whom the project has performed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evolution-control.com/index2.html |title=The Evolution Control Committee &amp;amp; Evolution Controlled Creations |publisher=Evolution-control.com |date= |accessdate=11 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710210226/http://evolution-control.com/index2.html |archivedate=10 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antediluvian Rocking Horse does not seek permission for use of samples.

King addressed the eighth biennial Copyright Law &amp; Practice Symposium, 7 November 1997 on the topic of fair dealing for copyrighted materials in art. In a lecture delivered to then [[Attorney-General of Australia]] [[Daryl Williams (politician)|Daryl Williams]], she argued that the re-use of culture should be encouraged, not hindered and litigated.&lt;ref name="copyright1"&gt;[http://abchax.com/pdf/acc/articles_pdf/A97n19.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 3/21/98 edition of the [[Sydney Morning Herald]], King was interviewed and described as Australia's "lone voice of dissent" in her public call for the diminution of copyright law. At around this time, King also assisted [[Negativland]] in its campaign to sue the [[RIAA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://negativland.com/riaa/dowesue.html |title=Do We Really Have To Sue The Riaa???? |publisher=Negativland.com |date= |accessdate=11 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428221237/http://www.negativland.com/riaa/dowesue.html |archivedate=28 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project insists that all its works are 'one hundred per cent recycled'.&lt;ref name="copyright1"/&gt; This is apparent in pieces like ''September Shuffle'', a track that features excerpts from [[Fox News]], The Pixies and, possibly, [[the KLF]].

ARH continues to actively defy copyright law and promote [[Fair Use]] within its pieces. A recent contribution is to [[Illegal Art]] mp3 exhibit ''Alias Frequencies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://illegalart.net/mp3s/05.04.html |title=ILLEGAL ART MP3s |publisher=Illegalart.net |date= |accessdate=11 October 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081001192204/http://illegalart.net/mp3s/05.04.html| archivedate= 1 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, King told [[The Age]] newspaper that the "[[remix]]" was nothing new and that appropriation inhered in the production of all artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/24/1064083041326.html |title=Copycat commandos - www.theage.com.au |publisher=Theage.com.au |date= 25 September 2003|accessdate=11 October 2008 |location=Melbourne| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081012173600/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/24/1064083041326.html| archivedate= 12 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dada influence==
The pair takes further inspiration from [[Dada]] and [[Situationist International|Situationist]] texts and practises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theshrubbery.com/1098/arh.html |title=The Shrubbery - Interview: Antediluvian Rocking Horse |publisher=Theshrubbery.com |date= |accessdate=11 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Dada is a term employed by French children to signify hobby horse. This translation, presumably, provided the spur for the project's name.) Matthew Rimmer interviewed the project for his doctoral thesis ''The Pirate Bazaar: The Social Life of Copyright Law''. He noted a distinction between the clearly political anti-copyright agenda of [[Negativland]] and the dada humour of Antediluvian Rocking Horse. It was Rimmer's contention that the project chooses psychedelic mischief over lucid political action.

In September 2006, DJ3 (Susan King) performed new works at [[Psy-Geo-Conflux]], New York City's annual situationist festival of [[psychogeography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://confluxfestival.org/artists.php?artistid=292 |title=conflux :: artists |publisher=Confluxfestival.org |date= |accessdate=11 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202544/http://confluxfestival.org/artists.php?artistid=292 |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This preoccupation with the [[psychogeography]] of [[Guy Debord]] continues with a project called ''Aural Maps'' which is a serial artwork seeking to navigate situations through sound.&lt;blockquote&gt;
Through unpacking the familiar, we chart our scope of reference, and consider how sound delineates space and creates patterns of movement, both physically and creatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://confluxfestival.org/projects.php?projectid=292 |title=Music to Unfurl By |publisher=Confluxfestival.org |date= |accessdate=11 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202550/http://confluxfestival.org/projects.php?projectid=292 |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Techno==
ARH sprang out of the [[techno]] culture of the early nineties. Initially, the project was embraced by techno media.
In reviewing ARH's first international release, Dom Phillips of [[Mixmag]] wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;imagine techno, yet constructed with burps, old samples and rocking through a gallery of strange voices, cut-ups, '70's elevator music run backwards...the lot....crazy channel hopping mish-mash, yet it all works!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Diane Lowry, then editor of [[Electronic Musician]], named the same disc Best Electronic Album for May 1997&lt;blockquote&gt;Techno dance group ARH approaches the editing of samples and tape loops the same as MTV cuts videos: fast and furious. Paul Wain, Susan King, and Ollie Olsen chop up, reverse, layer, and fade in and out television and radio broadcasts, found sounds, movies, vinyl, and CDs, thereby constantly changing the aural pictures.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Later outings are less influenced by techno.

[[File:Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia 1682 Claude Lorrain.jpg|thumb|320px|''Landscape with Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia'', [[Ashmolean Museum]]]]
[[File:Claude Lorrain - Aeneas's Farewell to Dido in Carthago - WGA05017.jpg|thumb|320px|''View of Carthage with Dido and Aeneas'', 1676, [[Kunsthalle, Hamburg]]]]

'''''Landscape with Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia''''' is a painting of 1682 in oil on canvas by [[Claude Lorrain]] (Claude Gellée, traditionally just "Claude" in English), a painter from the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] who spent his career in Rome.  It was painted in Rome for Prince [[Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna]] (1637–1689), Claude's most important patron in his last years, and is now in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]].  It is signed, dated with the year, and inscribed with the subject (at centre bottom), as Claude sometimes did with his less common subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Kitson, 31; Wine (1994), 24, 101&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Claude's last painting, and is perhaps not quite finished; it therefore does not appear in the ''[[Liber Veritatis]]'', where he made drawings to record his finished works. His date of birth is uncertain, but he was at least in his late seventies when he painted it, perhaps as old as 82. It was a [[pendant painting|pendant]] to his painting, completed six years earlier, ''View of Carthage with Dido and Aeneas'' (or ''Aeneas's Farewell to Dido in Carthage'', 1676, now [[Kunsthalle, Hamburg]]), another scene from the ''[[Aeneid]]'', coming earlier than this one.  This was the last of Claude's many harbour scenes.  With the Oxford painting hung on the left, the groups of figures in each face inwards, and the main buildings frame the outsides of the pair.&lt;ref&gt;Kitson, 31; Wine (1994), 101&lt;/ref&gt;  Both paintings feature large columns on a classical building, a punning reference to the [[Colonna family]], who included such a column in their coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;Wine (1994), 101, 103&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting depicts a scene from [[s:Aeneid (Dryden)/Book VII|book 7]], verses 483–499, of [[Virgil]]'s epic poem the ''[[Aeneid]]''.  [[Aeneas]]'s son [[Ascanius]] shoots a stag that is the house-reared pet of Silvia, daughter of "Tyrrheus, chief ranger to the Latian king" ([[John Dryden]]'s translation), provoking a war with [[Latium]] for the future site of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Kitson, 31&lt;/ref&gt;  Virgil's account, over 16 lines, spends most of them describing the closeness of the relationship between Sylvia and the stag.  The moment shown is one of stillness, as Ascanius takes aim and the stag, too trusting in its special status, looks at him. Once the arrow is fired the tranquil coastal landscape spreading out behind them will very quickly be disrupted by the war that Virgil goes on to describe.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 207&lt;/ref&gt;  

Unusually for Claude, the sky is overcast with storm clouds, and the trees are bent by a wind blowing from the left.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 207–208&lt;/ref&gt;  The elaborate temple in the [[Corinthian order]] has long been falling into ruin.  On the face of it this, in a scene from before the founding of Rome, is an anachronism that would have been apparent even in the 17th century, but it reflects the state to which ancient Roman monuments were reduced in Claude's own time.  The painting therefore embraces the whole trajectory of Roman civilization across history, from its start to its end, and peoples an idealized landscape from Claude's time with figures from its early history.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 212–214&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Subject and composition==
[[File:RomanVirgilFolio163r.jpg|thumb|[[Vergilius Romanus]], 5th-century, [[Vatican Library]], Cod. Vat. lat. 3867, f 163 recto]]
The subject is very rare in art, but there is a composition by [[Rubens]], with a painting in [[Girona]] and an [[oil sketch]] in the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], showing a different point in the story.  This is also a late work, but the composition could hardly be more different; here Sylvia nurses the dying stag as a female companion keeps the hounds off it, and fighting has broken out behind them between the Latins and Ascanius' party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/102467.html?mulR=140804051%7C20 ''The Death of Silvia's Stag''], Philadelphia Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt;  

Claude may well have been aware of a depiction in the [[Vergilius Romanus]], a 5th-century illustrated manuscript of the works of Virgil in the [[Vatican Library]] (Cod. Vat. lat. 3867, f 163 recto), which was a subject of interest to Roman cognoscenti. Stripped of the landscape the elements in the picture are similar, though Ascanius has already wounded the stag, and is pulling the bow for a second shot. A scene closer to the Rubens, with the wounded stag finding Silvia, is in the [[Vergilius Vaticanus]] of about 400; curiously, this is the point where the two [[Late antique]] Virgil cycles of illustration come closest to matching.&lt;ref&gt;Stansbury, Mark, Review of ''Wright, David H. The Roman Vergil and the Origins of Medieval Book Design. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2002." in ''The Medieval Review'', Indiana University, 2003, [https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/tmr/article/view/15504/21622 online text]&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition evolved through a series of drawings, beginning in 1669, with two now at [[Chatsworth House]] (1671 or 1678) and the Ashmolean (1682).&lt;ref&gt;Kitson, 31, 50–51; Wine (1994), 103; Waterhouse, 220&lt;/ref&gt; The final composition, with the river separating the archer and the stag, was only arrived at late in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Wine (1994), 21, 103&lt;/ref&gt;  As in the pendant in Hamburg, and many paintings by Claude, the composition draws the viewer's gaze into the background by having two large ''[[repoussoir]]'' elements at each side, where one is very close at hand, and the other set much further back.  The diagonal from left to right thus set up is balanced by the river, which flows in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 209–211&lt;/ref&gt;

==The figures==
[[File:Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia 1682 Claude Lorrain (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The group of hunters]]
Although virtually every painting by Claude contains figures, even if only a shepherd, their weakness has always been recognised, not least by Claude himself; according to his biographer [[Filippo Baldinucci]] he joked that he charged for his landscapes, but gave the figures for free. According to his other contemporary biographer [[Joachim von Sandrart]] he had made considerable efforts to improve them, but without success; certainly there are numerous studies, typically for groups of figures, among his drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Wine (1994), 12–14; Blunt, 275, n. 243&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Claude's last years his figures tend to become ever more elongated, a process taken to an extreme in this painting, of which even its owner says "The hunters are impossibly elongated – Ascanius, in particular, is absurdly top-heavy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.org/assets/docs/Exhibitions/AshmoleanPressImagesClaudeLorrain.pdf Ashmolean Press summary] for ''Claude Lorrain: The Enchanted Landscape'' in 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Its pendant has figures almost as extreme.  With the mid-20th fashion for medical diagnosis through art, it was suggested that Claude had developed an optical condition producing such effects, but this has been rejected by doctors and critics alike.

==Critical appreciation==
[[File:Якоб_Фердинанд_Воет._Портрет_Лоренцо_I_Онофрио_Колонна_(1684-1689),_герцога_и_князя_Палиано.jpg|thumb|200px|Prince [[Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna]], the patron, by [[Jacob Ferdinand Voet]]]]
Despite the figures, the painting has been one of the most admired of Claude's works. For [[Anthony Blunt]], it "reveals all the qualities of the artist's last phase ... The range of colour is reduced to its utmost limits: silvery green trees, pale grey-blue sky, grey architecture, and neutral-coloured dresses for the figures. The trees are now so diaphanous and the portico is so open that they hardly interrupt the continuity of the air.  The figures are thin and elongated, so that they, too, have the immaterial quality suited to this fairyland.  All the elements of Claude's poetry are here in their most naked form, but combined in a magical way which defies analysis".&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 176&lt;/ref&gt; 

For the Claude specialist [[Michael Kitson]] it "at once sums up and goes beyond Claude's previous development. It is utterly personal and yet has that profound, tremulous and remote quality which characterizes the style of other great artists in their old age."&lt;ref&gt;Kitson, 31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance and prices==
Once completed, the painting remained in the [[Colonna Palace]] in Rome until 1798/9,&lt;ref&gt;Kitson, 31&lt;/ref&gt; when the French occupied Rome, alarming the great families of the nobility.  Along with many other top paintings from Roman collections, it was bought by the English collector, dealer, writer, and curator [[William Young Ottley]]. Ottley brought it to London, at a time when Claudes were fetching huge prices.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 39–40, 274–275&lt;/ref&gt;  It was sold at [[Christie's]] on 16 May 1801 for £462, being from now on separated from its pendant, which fetched £840.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_tgGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA26 Sale details] in the ''Memoirs of painting, with a chronological history of the importation of pictures by the great masters into England since the French revolution'' (1824) by [[William Buchanan (art dealer)|William Buchanan]]. Nos # 31 and 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was bought by the banker [[Sir Thomas Baring, 2nd Baronet|Sir Thomas Baring, Bt]], and was at his house [[Stratton Park]], Hampshire, by 1837. It remained in the [[Baring family]] collection until the [[Francis Baring, 2nd Earl of Northbrook|2nd Earl of Northbrook]] sold it at Christie's in 1919 for £588; by this time prices for Claudes had plunged, allowing for inflation.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 276; Ashmolean&lt;/ref&gt;  It was given to the Ashmolean in 1926 by Mrs F. Weldon.&lt;ref&gt;Kitson, 31; Ashmolean&lt;/ref&gt;

The original title in Romanian is '''''Pasărea în văzduh'''''.

==Description==

In the ''Bird in Space'' works, Brâncuși concentrated not on the physical attributes of the bird, but instead on its movement. The bird's wings and feathers are eliminated, the swell of the body is elongated, and the head and beak are reduced to a slanted oval plane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/viewone.asp?dep=21&amp;viewmode=0&amp;item=1996.403.7ab Met description] of ''Bird in Space'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050925072110/http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/viewone.asp?dep=21&amp;viewmode=0&amp;item=1996.403.7ab |date=September 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven of the sculptures in the series are made of [[marble]], while the other nine were cast in [[bronze]]. The first and best known of the series is housed in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]], while two bronze casts (1928 and c.1941) reside in that city's [[Museum of Modern Art]]. Two versions of the sculpture, one bronze (1924) and one marble (1923–1924), are housed in the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. The National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., is home to a marble and a bronze from 1925 and 1927, respectively. A 1926 bronze is held by the [[Seattle Art Museum]] but is currently not on display. Two more bronze casts (1925–1926 and 1927) are on display at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and a 1931 bronze cast is housed at the [[Norton Simon Museum of Art]] in Pasadena, California. Another bronze of unknown casting date resides in the [[Peggy Guggenheim Collection]] in Venice, Italy, and the [[National Gallery of Australia]] in Canberra owns two marbles, both c.1931-1936, one white and one black.

==Legal Controversy==

In 1926-27, ''Bird in Space'' was the subject of a court battle over its taxation by [[U.S. Customs]]. In October 1926, ''Bird in Space'', along with 19 other Brâncuși sculptures, arrived in New York harbor aboard the steamship ''Paris''.&lt;ref name="''An Odd Bird'' by Stephanie Giry, ''Legal Affairs'', September–October 2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/September-October-2002/story_giry_sepoct2002.msp|title=Legal Affairs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While works of art are not subject to custom duties, the customs officials refused to believe that the tall, thin piece of polished bronze was art and so imposed the tariff for manufactured metal objects, 40% of the sale price or about $230&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,731160,00.html|title=Art: Bird|date=31 October 1927|publisher=|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (over $3130 in 2016 U.S. dollars). [[Marcel Duchamp]] (who accompanied the sculptures from Europe), American photographer [[Edward Steichen]] (who was to take possession of ''Bird in Space'' after exhibition), and Brâncuși himself were indignant; the sculptures were set to appear at the [[Brummer Gallery]] in New York City and then the [[Arts Club of Chicago|Arts Club]] in Chicago.  Under pressure from the press and artists, U.S. customs agreed to rethink their classification of the items, releasing the sculptures on bond (under "Kitchen Utensils and Hospital Supplies") until a decision could be reached. However, customs appraiser F. J. H. Kracke eventually confirmed the initial classification of items and said that they were subject to duty. Kracke told the ''New York Evening Post'' that "several men, high in the art world were asked to express their opinions for the Government.... One of them told us, 'If that's art, hereafter I'm a bricklayer.' Another said, 'Dots and dashes are as artistic as Brâncuși's work.' In general, it was their opinion that Brâncuși left too much to the imagination."&lt;ref name="''An Odd Bird'' by Stephanie Giry, ''Legal Affairs'', September–October 2002" /&gt; The next month, Steichen filed an appeal to the U.S. Customs' decision.

Under the 1922 Tariff Act, for a sculpture to count as duty-free it must be an original work of art, with no practical purpose, made by a professional sculptor.&lt;ref name="''An Odd Bird'' by Stephanie Giry, ''Legal Affairs'', September–October 2002" /&gt;  No one argued that the piece had a practical purpose, but whether or not the sculpture was art was hotly contested. The 1916 case ''United States v. Olivotti'' had established that sculptures were art only if they were carved or chiseled representations of natural objects "in their true proportions." Therefore, a series of artists and art experts testified for both the defense and the prosecution about the definition of art and who decides exactly what art is.&lt;ref name="''An Odd Bird'' by Stephanie Giry, ''Legal Affairs'', September–October 2002" /&gt;

Brâncuși's [[affidavit]] to the American Consulate explained the process of creating the piece, establishing its originality:&lt;ref name="''An Odd Bird'' by Stephanie Giry, ''Legal Affairs'', September–October 2002" /&gt;

:I conceived it to be created in bronze and I made a plaster model of it. This I gave to the founder, together with the formula for the bronze alloy and other necessary indications. When the roughcast was delivered to me, I had to stop up the air holes and the core hole, to correct the various defects, and to polish the bronze with files and very fine emery. All this I did myself, by hand; this artistic finishing takes a very long time and is equivalent to beginning the whole work over again. I did not allow anybody else to do any of this finishing work, as the subject of the bronze was my own special creation and nobody but myself could have carried it out to my satisfaction.

Despite the varied opinions on what qualifies as art presented to the court, in November 1928 Judges Young and Waite found in favor of the artist. The decision drafted by Waite concluded:&lt;ref name="''An Odd Bird'' by Stephanie Giry, ''Legal Affairs'', September–October 2002" /&gt;

:The object now under consideration . . . is beautiful and symmetrical in outline, and while some difficulty might be encountered in associating it with a bird, it is nevertheless pleasing to look at and highly ornamental, and as we hold under the evidence that it is the original production of a professional sculptor and is in fact a piece of sculpture and a work of art according to the authorities above referred to, we sustain the protest and find that it is entitled to free entry.

This was the first court decision that accepted that non-representational sculpture could be considered art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/martin/art_law/whatisart.htm|title=Art Law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''Bird in Space'' was the inspiration for a classical music composition by composer Timothy A. Corpus. This work was premiered at the architectural festival [[Open House Chicago]], in which the piece was performed throughout the festival at the [[Arts Club of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/October-2012/Fall-Culture-Guide-2012-Access-Contemporary-Music-Chicago-Architecture-Foundation-Team-Up/|title=Chicago Architecture Foundation, Classical Composers Team Up for Open House Chicago|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American poet, Muriel Rukeyser (1913-1980) refers to Brancusi's "Bird" in her poem, "Reading time: 1 minute 26 seconds" (1939) and uses this link to highlight the fear we have of embracing the new and non-utilitarian in the arts, and to encourage us to break through an unhealthy mind-set so that we may see the world anew: "... The climax when the brain acknowledges the world, / all values extended into the blood awake. / Moment of proof.  And as they say Brancusi did, / building his bird to extend through soaring air, / as Kafka planned stories that draw to eternity / through time extended.  And the climax strikes. ..." (from ''A Turning Wind'', 1939. Muriel Rukeyser).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46912">The '''California Art Club''' ('''CAC''') is one of the oldest and most active arts organizations in [[California]]. Founded in December 1909, it celebrated its centennial in 2009 and into the spring of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;A new club, The California Art Club, is announced. Antony Anderson, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, December 12, 1909&lt;/ref&gt; The California Art Club originally evolved out of The Painters Club of Los Angeles, a short-lived group that lasted from 1906–09.&lt;ref&gt;"The Painters’ Club, which was started a few years ago, was last year merged into the California Art Club." (Antony Anderson, Art and Artists, L.A. Times, January 29, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; The new organization was more inclusive, as it accepted women, sculptors and out of state artists.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Anderson, Exit the Painters’ Club, Los Angeles Times, December 12, 1909, III17&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the major early California painters belonged to the CAC, including  [[Franz Bischoff]] (1864–1929), [[Carl Oscar Borg]] (1879–1947), [[Edgar Payne]] (1883–1947), [[Julia Bracken Wendt]] (1868–1942), and [[William Wendt]] (1865–1946).&lt;ref&gt;Bischoff, Borg, and the Wendts were among the club's founders. Antony Anderson, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, February 13, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Payne served as the 9th President of the CAC, from May–December 1926. CAC Archives&lt;/ref&gt; As the members of the first generation of [[California Plein-Air Painting|California Plein-Air Painters]] aged and died, the membership was filled by younger professional painters, including [[Millard Sheets]] (1907–1989),&lt;ref&gt;Sheets joined the CAC in September 1954 - CAC Bulletin.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mabel Alvarez]] (1891–1985),&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez participated in CAC exhibitions from 1918–37.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emil Kosa, Jr.]] (1903–1968),&lt;ref&gt;Kosa, Jr. exhibited in 35th Annual (1944)&lt;/ref&gt; and watercolorist [[Rex Brandt]] (1914–2000),&lt;ref&gt;Brandt joined the CAC in October 1954 - CAC Bulletin.&lt;/ref&gt; along with amateur painters and commercial artists.

Today its membership consists of representational artists and sculptors, but it is broadly inclusive and includes many women painters as well as painters and sculptors who emigrated to the United States from Europe and Asia. The CAC hosts an annual Gold Medal Exhibition each year along with a number of other smaller public and special museum exhibitions. Headquartered in one of the large bungalows that was part of the historic [[Vista del Arroyo Hotel]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], the California Art Club has a number of chapters throughout California.&lt;ref&gt;As of July 2016, there are ten CAC Chapters throughout California. http://www.californiaartclub.org/about/cac-chapters&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the CAC==
The history of the California Art Club begins with an earlier organization, [[The Painters' Club of Los Angeles]]. On the evening of March 10, 1906 a number of painters who lived in the Los Angeles area met together for the purpose of forming a club. Soon afterward, on the evening of March 17, eleven of these same men met at
the studio of [[William Swift Daniell]] (1865-1933). After some discussion, it was unanimously decided to form a club then and there, and the Painters’ Club of Los Angeles was born with the goal to arrange exhibitions and further the fine arts in Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Anderson, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, March 25, 1906; 6,2,5&lt;/ref&gt; The eleven founding Charter Members included [[Antony E. Anderson]] (1863-1939), [[Carl Oscar Borg]] (1879-1947), [[William Henry Cole]] (1870-1955), [[Albert Clinton Conner]] (1848-1929), [[Frank C. Conner]], William Swift Daniell, [[David H. Dunn]], [[Frank Elwin Evans]], [[Frank Rennsselear Liddell]] (1864-1923), [[Hanson Duvall Puthuff]] (1875-1972), and [[George Thomas Winterburn]] (1865-1953).&lt;ref&gt;Minutes, March 17, 1906, Painters' Club of Los Angeles, CAC Archives&lt;/ref&gt; According to the membership roster, the Painters' Club grew and eventually numbered around 42 members.&lt;ref&gt;Membership Roster, Painters' Club of Los Angeles, CAC Archives&lt;/ref&gt; After several years and a number of exhibitions it became apparent to the members that the scope of the organization, which was open only to male painters, was too limited and a consensus arose to dissolve the organization in order to form one that was wider in scope. The Painters' Club of Los Angeles was disbanded in December 1909, but there would be a new group to follow, "to be called the California Art Club."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Antony, Los Angeles Times, December 12, 1909, III17&lt;/ref&gt; A core group of members from the Painters' Club - [[Charles Percy Austin]] (1883-1948), [[Franz Bischoff]] (1864-1929), Carl Oscar Borg, [[Benjamin Chambers Brown]] (1865-1942), Frank Rennsselear Liddell, Hanson Puthuff, and [[William Wendt]] (1845-1946) - would be instrumental in laying the groundwork for the nascent California Art Club, as well as supplying its first three Presidents.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Anderson, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, March 25, 1906; 6,2,5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Membership Roster, Painters' Club of Los Angeles, CAC Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Founding of the CAC==
The California Art Club was founded in December 1909, immediately after The Painters' Club of Los Angeles was disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Anderson, Exit the Painters’ Club, Los Angeles Times, December 12, 1909, III17&lt;/ref&gt; Although the date and location of the first club meeting is unknown, the second was held February 5, 1910 in [[Franz Bischoff]]'s Studio, located at 320 Pasadena Avenue, South Pasadena.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Anderson, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, February 13, 1910&lt;/ref&gt; Among its founding and earliest members were [[Hector Alliot]] (1862-1919), [[Antony E. Anderson]] (1863-1939), [[Charles Percy Austin]], [[Franz Bischoff]], [[Carl Oscar Borg]], Benjamin Chambers Brown, [[Mauritz DeHaaff]] (1877-1948), [[Allen Durand]] (1865-1939), [[Aaron E. Kilpatrick]] (1872-1953), [[Frank Rennsselear Liddell]], [[Everett Carroll Maxwell]], [[William A. Matern]] (1867-1923), [[Frederick Roland Miner]] (1876-1935), [[John Hubbard Rich]] (1876-1954), [[Rob Wagner]] (1872-1942), [[Jack Wells]] [or Welles], [[William Wendt]], and most likely Wendt's wife, sculptress [[Julia Bracken Wendt]] (1868-1942).&lt;ref&gt;See Julia Bracken Wendt's response (Open Letter, Los Angeles Times, January 1910) to Antony Anderson's Art and Artists column from December 12, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antony Anderson, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, February 27, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antony Anderson, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, February 13, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main objectives behind the founding of the new club was to expand its membership and encourage others to participate - "No longer limited to male painters based in L.A., the Club opened its membership to women, sculptors and artists living as far away as New York."&lt;ref&gt;Antony Anderson, Exit the Painters’ Club, Los Angeles Times, December 12, 1909, III17&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the club's Second Annual Exhibition in 1911,&lt;ref&gt;Held November 22 – December 6, 1911 at Blanchard Hall, Los Angeles; exhibition pamphlet, CAC Archives&lt;/ref&gt; membership had increased by about thirty members, including nine women: [[Helena Adele Dunlap]] (1876-1955), [[Helma Heynsen Jahn]] (1874-1925), [[Mary Ann Van Alstine Bartow]] (1848-1924), [[Alma May Cook]] (1884-1973), [[S. Henrietta Dorn Housh]] (1855-1919), [[Helen Hutchinson]] (1866-?), [[Louise Elizabeth Garden MacLeod]] (1857-1944), [[Lydie G. Price]], and [[Elizabeth Waggoner]].&lt;ref&gt;Second Annual Exhibition Pamphlet, 1911, CAC Archives&lt;/ref&gt; By early 1912 [[Xarifa Hamilton Towner]] (1881-?) would also join.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Anderson, Art Notes, Los Angeles Times, February 4, 1912, III18&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Renssellear Liddell served as the first club President from 1909-10.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Anderson, Exit the Painters’ Club, Los Angeles Times, December 12, 1909, III17&lt;/ref&gt; Liddell was succeeded by William Wendt who filled the office of President twice: from 1911-14 as the second President, and from 1917-18 as the fourth. Wendt's terms bookended the club's third President, Benjamin Chambers Brown, who held that office from 1915-16.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Anderson, California Art Club, Los Angeles Times, Dec. 12, 1915, III28&lt;/ref&gt; The organization grew quickly in prestige under Wendt and Brown, connecting itself with the newly formed [[Museum of History, Science and Art]] in Exposition Park. The Art Committee of the new museum's Gallery of Fine Arts included at least four CAC members, including Everett C. Maxwell, who was both an Honorary CAC Member as well as Curator of the County Museum Art Gallery. The club began holding its annual exhibitions in the new space less than a year after the new museum was founded, and would continue to do so for more than two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Anderson, Fifth Annual Exhibition, Los Angeles Times, Sept. 13, 1914, III10; Anderson, Fifth Annual Exhibition, Los Angeles Times, Oct. 11, 1914, III10; Anderson, Fifth Annual Exhibition Again, Los Angeles Times, Oct. 18, 1914, III6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antony Anderson, American Painters , Los Angeles Times, December 28, 1913, III5; This City as a Center of Art, Los Angeles Times, November 7, 1913, II3)&lt;/ref&gt;

As the CAC was being founded, [[California Impressionism]] was just beginning to emerge in Southern California. Many club members had studied overseas in European ateliers like the [[Académie Delécluse]], the [[Académie Julian]], and the [[École des Beaux-Arts]]. Benjamin Brown studied at the Académie Julian with [[Jean-Paul Laurens]] (1838-1921) and [[Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant]] (1845-1902); Rob Wagner was also a student at Académies Julian and Delécluse. John Hubbard Rich spent four years at the [[Art Students League]] in New York City, then spent time at the [[School of the Boston Museum]] as well as two years studying in Europe. Along with classical atelier painting, the influences of [[French Impressionism]] were starting to be felt. Helena Dunlap studied with [[William Merritt Chase]] (1849-1916) in New York City and [[André Lhote]] (1885-1962) in Paris, and Charles Percy Austin was a pupil of [[John Twachtman]] (1853-1902). Others like Julia Bracken Wendt, William Wendt, and Edgar Payne studied at schools like the [[Chicago Art Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Julia Wendt at CAI - McKay, James, The Dictionary of Sculptors in Bronze, Antique Collectors Club, London, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Edan, Artists in California 1786 – 1940&lt;/ref&gt; Through the work of its artists and its annual exhibitions, the CAC was greatly responsible for popularizing the Impressionist style in California. Authorities like Professor William Gerdts have long identified [[California Impressionism]] as a regional variation of [[American Impressionism]] which was a very broad movement that was loosely bound to the French style. Most American and California Impressionists adopted the painterly brush work, brighter palette and colored shadows of French Impressionism and the elementary practice of sketching outdoors, directly from nature or ''[[en plein air]]''.

==Early Years of the CAC and California Impressionism==
From its first exhibitions, the California Art Club became identified with Impressionism. In 1913, in the national magazine Arts Journal, the writer E.C. Maxwell wrote that "From a dozen different writers upon subjects pertaining to the development and trend of art in the west, the word has gone forth to the world that California, that land of golden light and purple shadows, is destined in the course of the next few years to give us a new school of landscape painting...Conditions seem right for a renaissance of art in California...If this art epoch of golden prophecy does not come to pass, it will not be the fault of the California Art Club." The activities of the California Art Club were chronicled in the pages of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', the ''Herald Examiner'' and the ''[[Pasadena Star News]]''. The art columnist for the ''Times'', Antony Anderson was a founding member of the club and he was lavish in his praise of its exhibitions and its leaders, men like William Wendt, Benjamin Chambers Brown and Jack Wilkinson Smith.

In the club's formative years, meetings were held at locations around Los Angeles, including members homes and studios,&lt;ref&gt;Meeting at Frank R. Liddell house, Anderson, Antony, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, June 5, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meeting at Mauritz DeHaaf studio, Anderson, Antony, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, April 2, 1911&lt;/ref&gt; various schools and galleries,&lt;ref&gt;Meeting in the rooms of the Sketch Club, Anderson, Antony, Art Notes, Los Angeles Times, May 5, 1912, III24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meeting at the Copp Building, Anderson, Antony, Art Notes, Los Angeles Times, September 14, 1913, III22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meeting at the Cannon Art School, Anderson, Antony, Art Notes, Los Angeles Times, December 14, 1913, III4&lt;/ref&gt; and the Earl House, 2425 Wilshire Boulevard in Westlake Park.&lt;ref&gt;Meeting at the Earl House, Jarrett, Mary, Foreword, Who’s Who in the California Art Club, Inc., Roster and By-Laws, 1984, 75th Anniversary Edition, p.8, CAC Archives&lt;/ref&gt; (now [[MacArthur Park]]). By the early 1920s, the club resolved to seek a more permanent location and laid out plans for a building fund with a goal to raise $150,000 primarily by exhibiting and selling artwork. CAC artist and Managing Director [[Walter Farrington Moses]] (1874-1947) led the effort of achieving their goal. A one-night exhibition was held at the Los Angeles Philharmonic Auditorium in 1923; included along with smaller donations was “$500 on the spot.”&lt;ref&gt;Of Interest to Artists, Los Angeles Times, December 17, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the CAC as an organization is most often identified with [[California Impressionism]], some CAC members worked in and experimented with other modes of painting and sculpting. [[Helena Dunlap]] (1876-1955),&lt;ref&gt;Dunlap is a very early member, first exhibiting with the CAC in their 2nd Annual Exhibition in 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; an early CAC member and exhibitor, also went on to found the [[Modern Art Society of Los Angeles]] in 1916 with five other CAC members: [[Bert Cressey]] (1883-1944), [[Meta Cressey]] (1882-1964), [[Edgar Keller]] (1868-1932), [[Henrietta Shore]] (1880-1963) and [[Karl Yens]] (1868-1945).&lt;ref&gt;Artists in California 1786 – 1940, Edan Milton Hughes&lt;/ref&gt; At the CAC's Annual Exhibition at Exposition Park in 1931, members [[Ruth Peabody]] (1893-1966) and [[Phil Dike]] (1906-1990) won top honors for their work, which were dubbed "ultra modern."&lt;ref&gt;Modernist Wins at California Art Exhibit, Los Angeles Express, November 19, 1931&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Two California Art Club Exhibition Prize Winners, Los Angeles Times, November 22, 1931&lt;/ref&gt; Another member, [[Stanton MacDonald-Wright]] (1890-1973),&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald-Wright joined the CAC in October 1954 - CAC Archives&lt;/ref&gt; was a co-creator of [[Synchronism]], an early abstract, color-based mode of painting which influenced artists like [[Donna Norine Schuster]] (1883-1953).&lt;ref&gt;Schuster exhibited with the CAC from 1915-38 and studied with MacDonald-Wright. Edan Hughes, Artists in America, 1786-1940&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 [[Mabel Alvarez]] became a member of the Group of Eight, along with [[Clarence Hinkle]], [[Henri De Kruif]], [[John Hubbard Rich]], Donna Schuster, [[E. Roscoe Shrader]], [[Edouard Vysekal]], and [[Luvena Buchanan Vysekal]].&lt;ref&gt;Mabel Alvarez papers, 1898-1987. Archives of American Art. 2011.

While the painters of the early California Art Club did not adhere to a stylistic code of any kind, they were all representational artists who worked from life, whether it was out doors, from nature or in the studio from models. The California Art Club was part of a broadly representational movement that held sway in California long after more modern styles of painting became popular elsewhere. During the 1910s and the "Roaring 20s" when the American economy bounded back from the post-World War I recession, the California Art Club grew in membership and prestige, but it lacked a permanent clubhouse. That changed in 1926, when the wealthy heiress and art patron [[Aline Barnsdall]] (1882-1946) gifted her home [[Hollyhock House]], designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], to the CAC to use as its headquarters as a fifteen-year loan. The club moved into the property atop Hollywood, known as Olive Hill, the following year. Gradually, during the 1930s, proponents of more modern movements also began to gain a foothold and younger patrons began to purchase their works instead of those of the California Impressionists.

==The Hollyhock House Years (1927-42) and the Depression==
By 1923, the idea of a new permanent home was gaining momentum. During “an animated meeting” at their temporary headquarters at 623 Park View, the CAC looked at two feasible options: [[Aline Barnsdall]] had offered the club use of Olive Hill, her estate in Hollywood; a second option comprised another location at “the southwest corner of Grand View and Third Street.”&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Antony, Of Art and Artists: California Club Planning to Build, Los Angeles Times, September 21, 1924, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later the idea of a permanent clubhouse was still enthusiastically discussed, but 1925 saw the Club forced to restructure their project due to its being “suspended temporarily on the resignation of the business manager.” Strong interest remained despite the fact that they hadn’t yet reached their fundraising goal.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Antony, Of Art and Artists: Members of Club Vote for Gallery, Los Angeles Times, April 5, 1925, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; With the Club’s efforts stalled, Aline Barnsdall approached the City of Los Angeles about managing a section of her estate as a cultural arts center.

Overlooking Hollywood Boulevard to the east and presenting panoramic views west towards the Pacific Ocean, the 36-acre hilltop estate south of Griffith Park was originally slated to include multiple structures dedicated to the arts. An eventual rift between Barnsdall and architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] meant that only three buildings would be completed: [[Hollyhock House]], named after Miss Barnsdall’s favorite flower, and two other structures referred to as “Residences A and B.”&lt;ref&gt;Merrell, Eric, California Art Club in Search of a Home: The Hollyhock Years, 1927-1942, California Art Club Newsletter, Winter 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually in 1926 the City of Los Angeles agreed to take eight acres. The discussions between the City and Miss Barnsdall about how the property could be used included a stipulation that the California Art Club be given a lease on Hollyhock House lasting fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;Art Club Takes Over New Home, Los Angeles Times, September 1, 1927, A1; Schrank, Sarah, Art and the City: Civic Imagination and Cultural Authority in Los Angeles, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008, p.38-39; California Art Club Bulletins, CAC Archives&lt;/ref&gt; In the California Art Club Bulletin, the club’s monthly publication, CAC President [[Edwin Roscoe Shrader]] (1878-1960) wrote accepting the gift: “Aline Barnsdall has brought to fruition her plans to establish a cultural center amidst the beauty of Olive Hill. The California Art Club happily, gratefully, accepts its share in this great movement and opens on August 31 the palatial home granted to the Club for fifteen years as its new galleries and headquarters.”&lt;ref&gt;Shrader, E. Roscoe, Realization, CAC Bulletin, Aug. 1927, Vol. II, No. 8; p.3, CAC Archives&lt;/ref&gt; The club feted Miss Barnsdall at a dinner and made her an Honorary Member.&lt;ref&gt;Art Club Takes Over New Home, L. A. Times, Sept. 1, 1927; 2,1,3)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art Club Takes Over New Home, A1&lt;/ref&gt;

The new clubhouse allowed the CAC to present lectures, club meetings, and black tie exhibition receptions. By early 1929, the CAC had attracted some 5,000 visitors to events and exhibitions at Hollyhock House.&lt;ref&gt;California Art Club guest register and scrapbooks, CAC Archives 1927-1961, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1929, the CAC hosted the first Black American art exhibition in Los Angeles. The exhibit included work by [[Henry Ossawa Tanner]] and renowned Los Angeles architect, [[Paul Williams (architect)|Paul R. Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;Millier, Arthur, Negro Art Attracts, Los Angeles Times, December 8, 1929, 21; Exhibitions Opened at Art Center, Los Angeles Times, December 2, 1929, A8; Negro Artists’ Work to be Seen, Los Angeles Times, November 29, 1929, A2&lt;/ref&gt;

The club initially maintained a semblance of normality during the Depression as monthly club meetings continued to attract members - a “Social Meeting” held on December 19, 1931, was attended by 175 members and guests.&lt;ref&gt;December Meetings, CAC Bulletin, Jan. 1932, Vol. VII, No. 1, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent new members joined the club, such as [[Colin Campbell Cooper]] (1856-1937),&lt;ref&gt;Cooper joined in March 1932 - CAC Bulletin, CAC Archives&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dean Cornwell]] (1892-1960),&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell joined in April 1932 - CAC Bulletin, CAC Archives&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alfredo Ramos Martinez]] (1872-1946).&lt;ref&gt;Martinez joined in July 1932 - CAC Bulletin, CAC Archives&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;January Meetings, CAC Bulletin, Feb. 1932, Vol. VII, No. 2, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; CAC member [[Richard Neutra]] debated architecture with [[Rudolph Schindler (architect)|Rudolph Schindler]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] visited a club meeting in April 1930 while working on his murals at Pomona College,&lt;ref&gt;May 1930 CAC Bulletin, CAC Archives&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] gave a lecture at a dinner in his honor on June 17, 1932.&lt;ref&gt;July 1932 CAC Bulletin, CAC Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

[A week before his CAC lecture, Siqueiros had unveiled his first L.A. mural, "Street Meeting," done on an exterior wall at Chouinard Art School. The group assisting him included CAC members [[Henri Gilbert de Kruif]] (1882-1944), [[Robert Merrell Gage]] (1892-1981), [[Barse Miller]] (1904-1973), [[Paul Starrett Sample]] (1896-1974), and [[Millard Sheets]]. Gage was then the current CAC President, Sample having held the post in 1931; Miller was 1st Vice President. Siqueiros had consulted with Neutra about new approaches for "Street Meeting" that might better withstand the hot and dry Southern California climate.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Rochfort, Mexican Muralists, Chronicle Books, San Francisco, 1993, p.146&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after his lecture at the Hollyhock House, Siqueiros would begin work on "América Tropical" with the help of twenty-nine artists, including CAC members Dean Cornwell, [[Karoly Fulop]] (1893-1963), and [[Frederick John Vrain Schwankowsky]] (1885-1974).&lt;ref&gt;Millier, Arthur, Huge Fresco for El Paseo, Los Angeles Times, August 24, 1932, p.15; Great Art Work to be Unveiled, Los Angeles Times, October 9, 1932, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;]

The stock market crash of 1929 was the big blow - it meant a decline in exhibition attendance and patronage. Then, as the Great Depression deepened, club membership gradually waned. This decline was somewhat inevitable as the founding members of the CAC aged, moved away or died throughout the 30s and 40s. William Wendt and Edgar Payne were living in Laguna Beach and had become active in the [[Laguna Beach Art Association]]. Membership fees for “Artists…and Lay Members” were reduced and it was noted in a bulletin that “a few more new members would enable us to join in the popular sport of ‘Balancing the Budget.’”&lt;ref&gt;Important Notice, CAC Bulletin, May 1932, Vol. VII, No. 5, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Also, following the example of other groups, the Club “cancelled all unpaid dues prior to January 1932, providing the current dues [were] paid in full.” In addition, it created an Assistance Fund for any member needing financial aid.&lt;ref&gt;Dues; An Assistance Fund, CAC Bulletin, Oct. 1932, Vol. VII, No. 9, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; The deep impact of the Depression on the CAC was seen in “a dwindling membership,” and corroborated reports that “the [Hollyhock] house was in pretty bad shape towards the end of [their] tenure” when their fifteen-year lease with the Hollyhock House ended in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Hollyhock House: The California Art Club Years, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; After briefly giving the club an extension of their lease in January 1942, L.A. Parks Commission forced CAC to abandon Olive Hill by March of that year.

The club established a temporary headquarters at Plummer Park until about August 1942, after which they met at the [[Women’s Club of Hollywood]] for a year. After the Women's Club, monthly meetings were held at the Masonic Temple from October 1943-February 1945. At the January 26, 1945 meeting at this location, Los Angeles Mayor [[Fletcher Bowron]] and Supervisor [[John Anson Ford]] were guests.&lt;ref&gt;California Art Club guest register and scrapbooks, CAC Archives 1927-1961, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar Years==
In 1946 the California Art Club partnered with the Veterans Administration to present the First Annual G.I. Art Exhibit at the Museum of History, Science and Art in Exposition Park. "First prize winners are given membership in the art club for one year with all fees and dues waived." There were forty-one exhibiting G.I. artists in all.&lt;ref&gt;Brushstrokes, L.A. Times, Aug. 4, 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, the CAC (along with other art clubs that exhibited there, including the Painters and Sculptors Club of L.A.) abruptly lost the museum venue where they had held their Annual Exhibitions since 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Schrank, Art and the City: Civic Imagination and Cultural Authority in Los Angeles, U. of Penn. Press, 2008, p.69&lt;/ref&gt; The new museum director, James H. Breasted, Jr., wanted to open the venue up to more artists, not just those in the clubs. It didn't go over well, and the headlines made it to Life Magazine: “The outraged artists set up their own canvasses on the museum’s steps and terrace and along the walls as examples of what should have been shown inside. Then they marched around the museum demanding that the director resign. Instead…[Director] James H. Breasted Jr. remained in his oak-doored office and quietly called police. Three radio patrol cars rolled up to the museum’s entrance and a swarm of police waded through canvasses of sunsets, mountain landscapes, pretty nudes and Chinese vases."&lt;ref&gt;Art Battle: Conservative Los Angeles painters protest ‘radicals’ hung in museum, Life, June 16, 1947, p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

Without headquarters or an exhibition venue to exhibit their work, meetings and exhibitions were held in less prestigious venues and patronage became a secondary concern. Annual exhibitions were held at venues such as the [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theater]] in [[Griffith Park]] (1949–66), [[Brand Library]] in Glendale (1979, 1982, 1990), and even a short-lived California Art Club Gallery located at 1309 Westwood Boulevard for a handful of years. Meeting places during this period included Channing Hall at United Methodist Church (March 1945-February 1947) and Rexall Square (September 1947-May 1949), with the group eventually settling into Rancho Golf Club House for two decades (September 1949 – 1969).&lt;ref&gt;CAC Bulletins, CAC Archives&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Matson]] was President of the California Art Club in 1961 and 1962. He was a landscape painter and an able organizer who had been active in many of the Southland art organizations. By the late 1960s and 1970s, the ranks of the California Art Club consisted primarily of amateur artists, but there was still a small group of professional painters that were active, such as [[Sam Hyde Harris]].

==The California Art Club Bulletin 1925-1994==
In November 1925, CAC President Shrader wrote in the foreword of the inaugural issue of The California Art Club Bulletin, "The Bulletin will fill a long-felt want in the activities of the Club." Published monthly for nearly 70 years, it reported on club activities, exhibitions, member news, meetings, lectures, and more, both within the club and around greater Los Angeles. After the July 1994 issue, the Bulletin was redesigned and renamed the California Art Club Newsletter, starting with the Summer 1994 issue. It continues to be printed for the Club membership on a quarterly basis and includes articles written by art historians and scholars.&lt;ref&gt;CAC Bulletins and Newsletters, 1925-present, CAC Archives&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;List of current CAC Newsletters http://www.californiaartclub.org/category/news/cac-newsletter&lt;/ref&gt;

==California Art Club Newsletter 1994-present==
Published by the California Art Club, the Newsletter is a quarterly journal that documents California's traditional arts heritage, both historic and contemporary. Each issue contains unique essays about artists and art movements written by art historians, museum curators, art writers, and artists. The publication includes "news briefs," club activities, membership news, book reviews, and exhibition listings.

Although the California Art Club was established in 1909, the first issue, Volume 1, No. 1, was printed in December 1925 and originally named "The California Art Club Bulletin" with artist [[Ralph Holmes]] (1876-1963) as its first editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.askart.com/artist/ralph_william_holmes/4040/ralph_william_holmes.aspx?stm=ralph%20holms|title=Ralph Holmes - Artist, Fine Art Prices, Auction Records for Ralph Holmes|website=www.askart.com|access-date=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Bulletin" was published as a monthly periodical to keep members informed of fellow members and the goings-on of the local burgeoning Los Angeles art scene. The publication operated as a volunteer effort and was managed by several editors who were members of the club. However, after the [[Great Depression]], [[Modernism]], and [[World War II]], the California Art Club fell on hard times, but still managed to exist, howbeit on a much smaller and scale.

With the 1990s resurgence of representational art forms, the California Art Club&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.askart.com/art/Groups/2/y/California%20Art%20Club|title=askART - The California Art Club Artists - Art Research|website=www.askart.com|access-date=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; experienced a revival that was launched in 1993. The organization began to re-brand itself as a prime leader in the [[contemporary-traditional art]] movement and recognized the need for a scholarly publication to help further their mission. Under the newly named editor-in-chief [[Elaine Adams]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.californiaartclub.org/bulletins90s#1994|title=The CAC Bulletins (1990-1994) – California Art Club|website=www.californiaartclub.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the June 1994 issue was renamed the "California Art Club Newsletter." Over the years, the Bulletin has expanded from its single front-and-back 8-1/2 x 11 page to its present 36-page quarterly journal printed by [[Typecraft]] in Pasadena, California.

=== List of Editors ===
Artist [[Ralph Holmes]] (1876-1963) served as the first editor of the "California Art Club Bulletin" from December 1925 to January 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.californiaartclub.org/bulletins20s#1925|title=The CAC Bulletins (1925-1929) – California Art Club|website=www.californiaartclub.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; From February 1927 to December 1931, artist [[Louise Everett]]  (1899-1959) served as editor; and from January to December 1932 John Coolidge was the editor. For ten years the Bulletin took a hiatus until 1942 when [[Edward Landser|Edward Lanser]] became its editor and changed the publication's name to "C.A.C. Bulletin: The Voice of the California Art Club." Lanser served as its editor until April 1948. Then, under [[Mary Jarrett]] who served as the new editor until 1954, the publication was renamed as "The Art Bulletin." Next, artist [[Vic Carl Houser]] (1895-1972) served as editor until May 1958; followed by artist [[Horace "H.E." Edmund Huey]] until March 1959, and in April 1959 Mary Jarrett returned to serve as editor, and then in June 1960 Vic Carl Houser returned as editor until April 1965. The Bulletin went into hiatus again until April 1968 when it published only one issue that year under [[Edris N. Baker]] as the editor. The next issue came out in October 1969 with artist [[Kaffy Reinhardt]] as the editor. Ruth Jones served as editor of the Bulletin until May 1994. Elaine Adams became editor-in-chief and renamed the publication as the "California Art Club Newsletter," which continues today in 2017 under her management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.californiaartclub.org/bulletins90s#1994|title=The CAC Bulletins (1990-1994) – California Art Club|website=www.californiaartclub.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival of the CAC==
By the early 1990s the membership of the California Art Club had been severely reduced. [[Peter Seitz Adams]], a member in earlier years (he exhibited in the 68th Annual Gold Medal Exhibition in 1977),&lt;ref&gt;California Art Club 1977 Gold Medal Show pamphlet&lt;/ref&gt; was contacted by longtime patron member [[Verna Gunther]] and 43rd CAC President [[Charles I. Harris]] (1922-2012) to take over the helm of the neglected California Art Club; Adams was elected the 44th President of the California Art Club in October 1993.&lt;ref&gt;President's Message, October 1993 CAC Bulletin&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, [[Elaine Adams]], managed the business of the organization, eventually becoming the Executive Director and CEO. In June 1994 Elaine Adams became editor-in-chief of the CAC Bulletin and immediately changed its name to the [[California Art Club Newsletter]] and soon expanded the publication to include scholarly articles about art history and profiles on contemporary artists of the CAC.&lt;ref&gt;Memoirs of the California Art Club 1993-2006 by Peter Adams, CAC President, Published in the 95th Annual Gold Medal Exhibition catalogue&lt;/ref&gt; The first wave of painters to join the reorganized California Art Club included [[Dan Goozeé]], [[Steve Huston]], [[Stephen E. Mirich]], [[William Stout]] and [[Tim Solliday]] (December 1993),&lt;ref&gt;December 1993 CAC Bulletin&lt;/ref&gt; (January 1994),&lt;ref&gt;January 1994 CAC Bulletin&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexey Steele]] and [[Jove Wang]] (February 1994),&lt;ref&gt;February 1994 CAC Bulletin&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel W. Pinkham]] and [[Sunny Apinchapong-Yang]] (June 1994),&lt;ref&gt;June 1994 CAC Bulletin&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meredith B. Abbott]], [[John Budicin]], [[Marcia Burtt]], [[Karl Dempwolf]], [[Richard Rackus]], [[Roy Rose]], and [[Leonid Steele]] (July 1994).&lt;ref&gt;July 1994 CAC Bulletin&lt;/ref&gt; A number of these artists consisted of students of [[Theodore Lukits]] (1897-1992) or the Russian landscape and figurative painter [[Sergei Bongart]] (1918–1985), both of whom had been CAC members themselves.

==Gold Medal Exhibition==
The Gold Medal Exhibition is held each spring.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.californiaartclub.org/exhibitions/annual-gold-medal-juried-exhibition&lt;/ref&gt; Previous locations include: the [[Autry Museum of the American West]], [[Pasadena Museum of History]], [[USC Fisher Museum of Art]], [[Pasadena Museum of California Art]], and [[Luckman Fine Arts Complex]] at California State University, Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.californiaartclub.org/exhibitions/annual-gold-medal-juried-exhibition/the-annual-gold-medal-exhibitions&lt;/ref&gt; Works are juried into the exhibition. Previously, at least two&lt;ref&gt;99th Annual Gold Medal Exhibition, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Gold Medals were awarded at each exhibition, but sometimes numbered as many as five per exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;including the "Edgar Payne Award for Best Landscape" [started 96th Annual, 2006]; the "Guy Rose Award for Best Multi-Figurative Composition," [started 98th Annual, 2009]; and the "Gold Medal Award for the Advancement of Art" [started 99th Annual, 2010].&lt;/ref&gt; The medals were voted on by the participating artist members of the organization. However, in 2016 the practice of presenting awards was discontinued.

The look and design of the medals changed throughout the years and were created by various club members. Along with the award medals given out at the Annual Exhibitions, the practice of which dates back at least to 1926, there were a number of Memorial Medals, Silver Medals, and Medals of Honor that were given to members to honor their services and special contributions to the Club. In particular is the Medal of Honor created by [[Philip Paval]] around 1953. This medal was awarded in 1954 to [[Sir Winston Churchill]] when the statesman was invited by Paval to join the Club as an Honorary CAC Member. Churchill accepted and the medal is presently on display in the Collection of Chartwell House in the U.K.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.californiaartclub.org/the-gold-medals&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special exhibitions==
In 1996, the California Art Club organized the California Wetlands Exhibition at the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County|Natural History Museum]] in historic [[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park]] in Los Angeles. In May through August 1998, the CAC mounted Treasures of the Sierra Nevada at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.&lt;ref&gt;The catalog for the Treasure of the Sierra Nevada exhibition was written by Jean Stern of the Irvine Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Carnegie Art Museum (Oxnard, California)|Carnegie Museum]] in [[Oxnard, California]], hosted a large exhibition of works by painters from the California Art Club in 1994, entitled, "The California Art Club: 85 Years of Art". In 1997, a traveling exhibition which contrasted the work of American Impressionists and Classical Realist painters from the East and Midwestern United States along with the California Impressionists titled, "East Coast Ideals West Coast Concepts," traveled from the Carnegie Museum in Oxnard to the [[Springville Museum of Art]] in [[Springville, Utah]] to the [[Academy of Art College]] in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;See catalog listed below, ''East Coast Ideals, West Coast Concepts''.&lt;/ref&gt; The California Art Club also organized and sponsored a traveling exhibition entitled, "Theodore Lukits, An American Orientalist," dedicated to the Asian-themed works of Thedore Lukits, who had first been a member of the California Art Club in 1922 and was later made a Life Member. This exhibition of colorful still lifes and figurative works originated at the [[Pacific Asia Museum]] in the fall of 1998 and traveled to the Carnegie Art Museum in the winter of 1998 and 1999, then concluded at the Muckenthaller Cultural Center in [[Fullerton, California]], in the Spring of 1999.&lt;ref&gt;This exhibition was curated by Jeffrey Morseburg and the CAC's Peter Adams.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1999, the California Art Club began a relationship with the Frederick R. Weisman Museum of Art at [[Pepperdine University]] in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] with the exhibition entitled, "On Location in Malibu".

==CAC organization==

===Membership===
The California Art Club membership is broad, with fewer than 2,000 members in a number of categories of membership. Signature Members are the most established painters who have been approved for membership by their peers from the ranks of Artist Members. Artist Members are juried into the organization from new applicants and the ranks of the Painting Patron Members. There is a category for out of state artist members, enabling the group the benefit of having the work of some of America's best traditional painters. There is also a large membership of Patron Members and also a Collector's Circle, which requires a donation to the organization.

'''Celtic inscribed stones''' are stone monuments dating from 400 to 1000 AD. They are inscribed with [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] or [[Latin]] text, which can be written in [[Ogham inscription|Ogham]] or [[Latin script|Roman]] letters. Some stones have both Ogham and Roman inscriptions. The stones are found in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[Brittany]], the [[Isle of Man]], and parts of western [[England]] (mainly [[Cornwall]], [[Devon]], and [[Lundy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp/database/ |title=Celtic Inscribed Stones Project history |accessdate=2008-01-08 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They relate to other standing stones with decoration, such as the [[Turoe Stone]] and [[Castlestrange Stone]].

'''Clay &amp; Paper Theatre''' is a [[community art]]s [[theatre]] company in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada that produces [[narrative theatre]] using large-scale [[puppets]], masks, [[stilts]], [[visual imagery]], [[music]], and [[poetry]]. A fundamental component of Clay &amp; Paper Theatre's mandate is [[social inclusion]].

==Origins==

Clay &amp; Paper Theatre was founded in 1994 by its [[artistic director]], David Anderson. David helped to establish the organization in [[community]]-centered [[Dufferin Grove Park]], Toronto, where they have a small workshop and storage facility.

==Festivals==

Clay &amp; Paper Theatre delivers an annual [[multidisciplinary]] summer [[festival]] called ''Day of Delight''. Coinciding with summer [[solstice]], ''Day of Delight'' is a celebration of love, courtship and desire.

==Plays==

Each summer, Clay &amp; Paper Theatre produces a new [[Canada|Canadian]] play which runs for up to 5 weeks in Dufferin Grove Park.  These plays are built, rehearsed and performed in full public view and admission to all performances is on a [[pay what you can]] basis.

==Community Parades==

Occurring in late October on the Saturday before [[Halloween]], ''Night of Dread'' is an annual community event in which giant puppets and images of fears are paraded through the streets and then burned in a bonfire at Dufferin Grove Park with live music, dancing and [[fire spinning]].  Attracting thousands of revelers, 2010 marks the eleventh annual ''Night of Dread'' celebration.

==Projects==

[[File:Body measures SVG.svg|lang=english|thumb|right|Some examples of body measurements used for sizing of clothes.]]
In [[clothing]], '''clothing size''' refers to the label sizes used for garments sold [[Ready-to-wear|off-the-shelf]]. There are a  large number of standard sizing systems around the world for various garments, such as [[Dress (garment)|dresses]], tops, [[skirt]]s, and [[trousers]]. Made-to-order garments require measurements to be taken, but these do not need to be converted into national standard form.

There are three approaches for size-labelling of clothes:
* '''Body dimensions''': The label states the range of body measurements for which the product was designed. (For example: bike helmet label stating "head girth: 56–60 cm")
* '''Product dimensions''': The label states characteristic dimensions of the product. (For example: jeans label stating inner leg length of the jeans in centimetres or inches (not inner leg measurement of the intended wearer))
* '''Ad hoc sizes''': The label states a size number or code with no obvious relationship to any measurement. (For example: Size 12, XL)

Traditionally, clothes have been labelled using many different ad hoc size systems, which has resulted in varying sizing methods between different manufacturers made for different countries due to changing demographics and increasing rates of obesity, a phenomenon known as [[vanity sizing]]. This results in country-specific and vendor-specific labels incurring additional costs, and can make internet or mail order difficult. Some new standards for clothing sizes being developed are therefore based on body-dimensions, such as the [[EN 13402]] "Size designation of clothes".

== History of standard clothing sizes ==
Before the invention of clothing sizes in the early 1800s, all clothing was made to fit individuals by either tailors 
or makers of clothing in their homes. Then garment makers noticed that the range of human body dimensions was relatively small. Therefore, sizes were invented to
* '''Horizontal torso measurements''' include the neck circumference, the shoulder width, the [[bustline|bustline measurements]] – over-bust circumference, the full bust circumference, the bust-point separation, and the under-bust (rib-cage) circumference – the natural [[waistline (clothing)|waist circumference]], the upper hip circumference and the lower hip circumference. 
* '''Vertical torso measurements''' include the back (neck-waist) length, the shoulder-waist length (not the same as the back length, due to the slope of the shoulder), the bust-shoulder length, the bust-waist length, and the two hip-waist lengths.
*  '''Sleeve measurements''' include the under-arm and over-arm lengths, the fore-arm length, the wrist circumference and the biceps circumference.

However, because of the [[drape]] and ease of the fabric, not all measurements are required to obtain a well-fitting apparel in most styles.

The third standard [[EN 13402]]-3 seeks to address the problem of irregular or [[Vanity sizing]] through offering a [[International System of Units|SI unit]] based labelling system, which will ALSO pictographically describe the dimensions a garment is designed to fit, per the ISO 3635 standard.

This has resulted in variations between manufacturers and a tendency towards [[vanity sizing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Clifford| first = Stephanie| title = One Size Fits Nobody: Seeking a Steady 4 or a 10| accessdate = 2017-06-14| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/25/business/25sizing.html?nytmobile=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Serbia still use the JUS (F.G0.001 1979, F.G0.002 1979, F.G0.003 1979) standards developed in the former [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ujevi|first1=Darko|last2=Szirovicza|first2=Lajos|last3=Karabegovi|first3=Isak|title=Anthropometry and the Comparison of Garment Size Systems in Some European Countries|date=2005|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to typical girth measurements clothing is also marked to identify which of 5 height bands: X-Short, Short, Medium, Tall, X-Tall, and body types: Slim, Normal, or Full, it is designed to fit.

There is no mandatory clothing size or labeling standard in the U.S, though a series of voluntary standards have been in place since the 1930s. The U.S. government, however, did attempt to establish a system for women's clothing in 1958 when the National Bureau of Standards published "Body Measurements for the Sizing of Women's Patterns and Apparel." The guidelines of the book was made a commercial standard and was even updated in 1970. But the guide was eventually degraded to a voluntary standard until it was abolished altogether in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/11/the-absurdity-of-womens-clothing-sizes-in-one-chart/|title=The absurdity of women’s clothing sizes, in one chart|last=Ingraham|first=Christopher|date=2015-08-11|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private organization [[ASTM International]] started to release its own recommended size carts in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3532014/women-clothing-sizes-history/|title=When — And Why — We Started Measuring Women's Clothing|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the common US misses sizes have not had stable dimensions.  Clothing brands and manufacturers size their products according to their preferences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, the dimensions of two size 10 dresses from different companies, or even from the ''same'' company, may have grossly different dimensions; and both are almost certainly larger than the size 10 dimensions described in the [[US standard clothing size|US standard]].  [[Vanity sizing]] may be partly responsible for this deviation (which began in earnest in the 1980s).

e.g.  a dress marked '''13-Y-PP''' or '''13-Y-P''' would be designed for someone with an 89&amp;nbsp;cm bust and 89&amp;nbsp;cm hips, while a dress marked '''13-B-T''' would be targeted at a taller individual with 105&amp;nbsp;cm hips, but the same 89&amp;nbsp;cm bust. The B fitting adds 12&amp;nbsp;cm and the T height modifier 4&amp;nbsp;cm to the base hip measurement 89 + 16 = 105&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese Size Charts|url=http://web.ita.doc.gov/tacgi/overseasnew.nsf/annexview/Japanese+Size+Charts|website=International Trade Administration|publisher=JIS|accessdate=2014-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally there are a set of age based waist adjustments, such that a dress marketed at someone in their 60s may allow for a waist 9&amp;nbsp;cm larger than a dress, of the same size, marketed at someone in their 20s. The age based adjustments allow for up to a 3&amp;nbsp;cm increase in girth, per decade of life.

=== Italian sizes (ITA) ===
Dress sizes are calculated as follows: 
* Standard dress size = (Bust Circumference cm / 2)

=== French sizes (FRA/BEL) ===
Dress sizes are calculated as follows: 
* Standard dress size = (Bust Circumference cm / 2) - 4

=== Germanic sizes (DE/AT/NL/SE/DK) ===
Dress sizes are calculated as follows: 
* Standard dress size (Height 164–170&amp;nbsp;cm) = (Bust Circumference cm / 2 ) - 6
* Short dress sizes (Height &lt;164&amp;nbsp;cm) = Standard dress size / 2
* Tall dress sizes (Height &gt;170&amp;nbsp;cm) = Standard dress size * 2

[[Image:Corpod'aria.jpg|thumb|260px|"Corpo d'Aria", 1960.]]
'''''Corpo d'aria''''' ("Body of Air"; plural ''Corpi d'aria'') is an [[artist's multiple]] by the Italian artist [[Piero Manzoni]]. Manufactured between October 1959 and March 1960, the pieces are a box, a tripod base, a deflated balloon and a mouthpiece. 45 copies were made and sold at 30,000 [[Italian lira|lire]] each.  Originally, any buyer could ask Manzoni to inflate the balloon himself, but would be charged an extra [[Deutschmark]] for every litre of air expanded. When fully expanded, the balloons measured 80&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Piero Manzoni Catalogue Raisoné, Battino &amp; Palazzoli&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public presentation==
The ''Corpi d'aria'' were first exhibited at the Galleria Azimut, run by Manzoni and his friend, the Italian artist Enrico Castellani, from May 3 to May 9, 1960. Manzoni organised an elaborate photo shoot  and a short film to publicise the event. He was to write later in the year that the bodies had sold well.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Heinz Mack, quoted in ''Piero Manzoni Catalog Generale'', vol 1, Celant, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

By making a purely transient work, that would deflate before the buyer’s eyes, Manzoni was parodying the traditional sculptural emphasis on permanence and mocking the traditional emphasis on the artist’s creative force. He was also using modern materials to suggest an aggressively modern aesthetic whilst creating a poetic metaphor for the transience of life itself.

== Related works==

===''Fiato d’artista''===

The most famous related work is the ''Fiato d’artista'' (''Artist’s Breath''), involving red, blue or white balloons inflated by Manzoni himself, closed with string and lead, with the name "Piero Manzoni" punched into it, then attached to a wooden base with a plaque on it using [[gesso]]. The pieces were made in 1960, and 11 examples are known to have survived, although all are now in an extreme state of decomposure. When exhibited now, the works inevitably assume the aura of a modern [[memento mori]],&lt;ref&gt;''Manzoni at the Serpentine Gallery'', London, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; featuring a rotting plastic membrane stuck to a polished wooden base, with a brass plaque commemorating the original act.

===Placentarium===
The largest variation on the theme was a giant double-skinned Placentarium, filled with compressed air to keep the balloon inflated. Manzoni designed especially for the projection of [[Otto Piene]]'s ''Light Ballets'', but also referred to the building housing a giant maze, made up of 60 cells controlled by "an electric brain".&lt;ref&gt;"Placentarium" typescript published in ''Piero Manzoni, Catalogo Generale'', Celant, Prearo Editions&lt;/ref&gt; Equipped with 73 alcoves for viewers, the Placentarium was intended to be silver on the outside and white internally. Designs and a photograph of a small architectural model survive.&lt;ref&gt;''Manzoni'', Celant, Electa 2007 pp. 242-245&lt;/ref&gt;

Manzoni simultaneously planned a series of public sculptures, of balloons 2.5&amp;nbsp;m diameter, to be installed in parks. These were to be fitted with air compressor to slowly pulsate ‘with a slow unsynchronized rhythm of breathing.’ He never took this idea further than a small experimental version.

The final experiment was for a sphere held suspended by a jet of air. Again, this never advanced beyond a small experimental [[maquette]], but emphasises Manzoni’s conception of balloons representing freedom and weightlessness.

== Influences ==

Manzoni is known to have been heavily influenced by [[Yves Klein]],&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery, p82&lt;/ref&gt; who had released 1001 blue balloons on the opening night of his "Proposition: Monochrome" exhibition at [[Iris Clert]]’s gallery, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Weitemeier, Taschen 2001, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andy Warhol]] would later use balloons in a similar way, but filled with helium rather than suspended in a stream of compressed air. Indeed, his first balloon, made in 1965, corresponded to an unfulfilled project described by Manzoni in a letter as ‘a cluster of pneumatic cylinders, elongated in shape, like steel, which would vibrate in the blowing of the wind.’&lt;ref&gt;''Paintings &amp; Sculptures, The Andy Warhol Catalogue Raisonne'' 02B, Phaidon, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; [[Damien Hirst]] has used ping pong balls suspended in compressed air, but within the context of floating above a bed of sharp knives or a skeleton.

His most lasting influence, however, was on [[Arte Povera]], a group of Italian artists, including [[Luciano Fabro]] and [[Alighiero e Boetti]], who brought everyday materials into their work in a movement analogous to contemporary radical politics. (see [[Protests of 1968]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10454 MoMA.org | The Collection | Arte Povera&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Locke Hall''' is a highly decorated former [[Assistant United States Attorney]], [[Naval Intelligence]] officer, and author.

==Early life==
Hall was born in [[California]] in 1955.  He received a BA from [[Dartmouth College]], an MBA from [[Yale]], and JD and MA degrees from the [[University of Pennsylvania]].  After law school, Hall served as a law clerk to the Honorable [[Walter King Stapleton]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]].

==Career==

===Assistant United States Attorney===
Hall served for 23 years with the [[United States Department of Justice]] as an [[Assistant United States Attorney]], retiring in 2013.  He tried a large number of significant cases to verdict, including mobster Roy Stocker of the [[K&amp;A Gang]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Slobodzian,"Federal Jury Convicts 3 In Drug Ring", The Philadelphia Inquirer, February 28, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  Hall also prosecuted the Leath Cocaine Trafficking Organization, the leaders of which were involved in shooting Philadelphia Police Officer Donald McMullin.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-paed-2_93-cr-00386/pdf/USCOURTS-paed-2_93-cr-00386-2.pdf; https://www.deseretnews.com/article/266613/OFFICER-HOPES-TO-WORK-BESIDE-HIS-TWIN-AGAIN.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

A significant focus of Hall's prosecutorial career was the investigation and prosecution of weapons proliferation and technology transfer offenders.  In the 1990s, he prosecuted the Armaments Corporation of South Africa ([[Armscor (South Africa)|Armscor]]), Kentron, Fuchs Electronics, and others for violations of the Arms Export Control Act during the [[apartheid]] era.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisconsinproject.org/south-african-firms-settle-arms-smuggling-case/; https://www.deseretnews.com/article/616104/After-35-years-US-lifts-S-Africa-arms-embargo.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The ARMSCOR case was a significant point of contention between the United States and the Republic of South Africa because ARMSCOR and Kentron were state-owned corporations.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1991-11-01/news/mn-602_1_south-africa; https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1996/02/21/us-refusal-to-drop-case-against-s-african-firm-causes-friction/2d1fc0c2-e314-4a0f-a049-f398b64bcf9c/&lt;/ref&gt;  After lengthy negotiations, the dispute was resolved by the pleas of ARMSCOR, Kentron, and Fuchs to criminal charges and the payment of fines in excess of $11 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wisconsinproject.org/south-african-firms-settle-arms-smuggling-case/&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2004 to 2009, Hall investigated and prosecuted Amir Ardebili, an Iranian arms procurement agent working in Shiraz, Iran, acquiring components for the F4, F14, and other military aircraft, as well as microchips for use in phased array radar.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crime-iran/iranian-pleads-guilty-to-u-s-arms-trafficking-charges-idUSTRE5B15JU20091202&lt;/ref&gt;  The years long investigation resulted in an undercover meeting between Ardebili and U.S. agents on October 1 and October 2, 2007 in Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia, where Ardebili was arrested by Georgian authorities.  He was extradited to the United States in January 2008.  Ardebili pled guilty to violations of the Arms Export Control Act, International Emergency Economic Powers Act, smuggling, conspiracy and money laundering in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justice.gov/file/438491/download&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ardebili case is the subject of a book, Operation Shakespeare: The True Story of an Elite International Sting, written by John Shiffman.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Operation-Shakespeare/John-Shiffman/9781451655162&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009 to 2013, Hall led the undercover investigation and prosecution of Xiang Li, a Chinese software pirate. Xiang Li's Chengdu, China-based operation sold over $100 million in cracked software products with multiple high-tech applications, including telecommunications, explosive simulation, aerospace, satellite tracking, and flight simulation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/business/chinese-man-pleads-guilty-in-copyright-violation-case.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The undercover investigation led to a meeting on Saipan between federal agents and Xiang Li in June 2011.  At that meeting, Xiang Li delivered 20 gigabytes of proprietary data hacked from a defense contractor.  Xiang Li was charged with trafficking in more than $100 million in stolen copyrighted software.  He pled guilty in January 2013 and in June 2013 was sentenced to 12 years incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ice.gov/doclib/news/releases/2013/130108wilmington2.pdf;  https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/USDHSICE/2013/06/11/file_attachments/217734/Crack_99_Sentencing_Memorandum.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall has testified before the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, Committee on Foreign Affairs, United States House of Representatives on "Examining the Effectiveness of the Kingpin Designation Act in the Western Hemisphere."&lt;ref&gt;https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/hearing/subcommittee-hearing-examining-effectiveness-kingpin-designation-act-western-hemisphere/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hall also served as the Special Prosecutor for the [[FBI]] Art Crime Team. During this time, he worked closely with FBI Special Agent [[Robert King Wittman]].  Hall negotiated the return of three stolen [[Norman Rockwell]] paintings from Brazil in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/13/us/national-briefing-midwest-minnesota-stolen-rockwell-paintings-found.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he led the successful undercover investigation and prosecution of Marcus Patmon, an art thief who sold stolen works by [[Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/baltimore/press-releases/2009/ba100209c.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Hall forfeited and returned to Iraq a collection of Mesopotamian artifacts in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/baltimore/press-releases/2010/ba102510a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Hall affected the return to Peru of a gold Moche monkey head (circa 300 A.D.) that had been looted from the royal tombs of Sipan.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/peruvian-artifact-repatriated&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Hall seized and forfeited the Rosenberg Diary, the long-lost diary of [[Alfred Rosenberg]], Nazi propagandist and Reich Minister for the occupied eastern territories. The Rosenberg Diary is now part of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|Holocaust Museum]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justice.gov/usao-de/pr/long-lost-rosenberg-diary-recovered&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military Service===
Hall served in the [[United States Navy]] and Navy Reserve as an intelligence officer for thirty years.  Commissioned in 1984, he retired at the rank of Captain in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/messages/Documents2/NAVADMINS2/NAV2005/NAV05204.txt&lt;/ref&gt; He commanded three intelligence units and served with the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]], the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], in addition to numerous Navy commands.  He was a third generation naval officer, his father having served as a Marine Corps officer with the [[Second Marine Division]] in [[World War II]].

'''Extant literature''' and '''extant music''' refers to texts or music that has survived from the past to the present time, as opposed to [[lost work]]. Extant literature can be divided into extant original [[manuscript]]s, copies of original manuscripts, quotations and paraphrases of passages of non-extant texts contained in other works, translations of non-extant texts into other languages, or, more recently, photocopies or digital copies of texts.

The '''Folk Music Society of Ireland'''&lt;ref&gt;http://folkmusicsocietyofireland.wordpress.com/fmsi-history/&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in Dublin in 1971 by a group of interested individuals with the aims of encouraging interest and promoting research in the traditional music, song and dance of Ireland. To this end it organised a regular programme of public lectures, recitals and seminars. By 2003 the Society felt that FMSI had largely fulfilled its initial intentions, and it decided to bring its main activities &lt;ref&gt;http://folkmusicsocietyofireland.wordpress.com/activities-1971-2001/&lt;/ref&gt; to an end. It does however continue to act in its publishing capacity. This archival site is being preserved for its historical interest. It is being kept updated by the addition of digitised material and PDF downloads on its new website.&lt;ref&gt;http://folkmusicsocietyofireland.wordpress.com/news-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journal ==

'''James Elliott Bama''' (born April 28, 1926, [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], [[New York (state)|New York]])&lt;ref name="Mantle Fielding's"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kane|first=Brian M.|title=James Bama: American Realist|year=2006|publisher=Flesk|location=Santa Cruz, CA|isbn=0-9723758-8-0|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[artist]] known for his realistic paintings and etchings of [[Western United States|Western]] subjects. Life in [[Wyoming]] led to his comment, "Here an artist can trace the beginnings of Western history, see the first buildings, the oldest wagons, saddles and guns, and be up close to the remnants of Indian culture ... And you can stand surrounded by nature's wonders."

==Biography==
Born in [[Manhattan]] in 1926, he grew up copying [[Alex Raymond]]'s ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' [[comic strip]]. He had his first professional sale when he was 15, a drawing of [[Yankee Stadium]] in the ''[[New York Journal-American]]''. He graduated from New York's [[The High School of Music and Art|High School of Music and Art]] and entered the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]], working as a mechanic, [[mural]] painter, and physical training instructor.

When discharged from the service, and back in New York City, he studied drawing and anatomy at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]]. Beginning in 1951, he was an illustrator at New York's Charles E. Cooper Studios for 15 years. His first paperback cover was Nelson Nye's ''A Bullet for Billy the Kid'' (1950). Bama had a 22-year career as a successful [[commercial artist]], producing paperback book covers, movie posters and illustrations for such publications as ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'', ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' and ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', and his numerous clients included the New York Giants football team, the Baseball and Football Halls of Fame and the U.S. Air Force. Beginning with ''The Man of Bronze'' (1964), he did a powerful set of 62 covers for the ''[[Doc Savage]]'' Bantam Books paperbacks, often using as a model actor [[Steve Holland (actor)|Steve Holland]], star of TV's ''Flash Gordon'' (1954–55). He also painted the box cover art for [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora]]'s monster model kits, including [[King Kong]], [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein]], [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] and [[The Mummy (franchise)|The Mummy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jdevito.com/tim.htm The Art of Joe DeVito - Tim Lasiuta Interview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 he married Lynne Klepfer, a New York University graduate with an art history major. Two years later, in June, 1966, the couple headed west as guests of artist Bob Meyers at his Circle M ranch near [[Cody, Wyoming]]. Meyers had walked out on his career as a successful Manhattan illustrator with such magazines as ''[[True (magazine)|True]]'' and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' to run his ranch and paint. After return visits in 1967, the Bamas left New York and moved during September, 1968, into a cabin on Meyers’ ranch. Bama began to paint contemporary Western subjects during the daytime while doing his freelance illustrations in the evenings. He recalled, "I never came out here with the idea to be a Western artist. It just happened, and that’s the way it should be."

In 1970 Bob Meyers was murdered, and his widow Helen moved from the ranch. The Bamas moved to a house on Dunn Creek, Wapiti, 20 miles outside Cody, in 1971. In May, 1971, Bama connected with a New York dealer, prompting his decision to abandon illustration and put his total concentration into the creation of easel paintings. In Wapiti, James and Lynne Bama built a home and studio, moving into it when their son Ben was born in 1977.

His work is collected in ''The Western Art of James Bama'' (Bantam Books, 1975) and ''The Art of James Bama'' (1993). Brian M. Kane's ''James Bama: American Realist'' (Flesk, 2006) has an introduction by [[Harlan Ellison]].

==Style==
Bama's art is realism. He sometimes takes advantage of his medium to use lighting techniques—such as [[Butterfly (lighting)|butterfly lighting]]—that would not be practical in a photograph taken under ambient light.

==Awards==
Bama was inducted into the Illustrator’s Hall of Fame on June 28, 2000. At the [[Buffalo Bill Historical Center]], when he was the first Honored Artist at the Buffalo Bill Art Show in 2003, Bama commented, "Everything I’ve done — the rodeo, the trappers, the mountain men — has been done around here. The fact that I’m from Cody makes this very significant to me. They’re really honoring Cody and the Buffalo Bill Historical Center."

He was inducted into the Monster Kid Hall Of Fame at [[The Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

'''Jazz bass''' is the use of the [[double bass]] or [[bass guitar]] to [[Jazz improvisation|improvise]] [[accompaniment]] ("comping") [[bassline]]s and solos in a [[jazz]] or [[jazz fusion]] style. Players began using the double bass in jazz in the 1890s to supply the low-pitched [[walking bass]]lines that outlined the [[chord progression]]s of the [[song]]s. From the 1920s and 1930s [[Swing music|Swing]] and [[big band]] era, through 1940s [[Bebop]] and 1950s [[Hard Bop]], to the 1960s-era "[[free jazz]]" movement, the resonant, woody sound of the double bass anchored everything from small jazz combos to large jazz [[big band]]s.

Beginning in the early 1950s,&lt;ref name="musicradar.com"&gt;http://www.musicradar.com/news/bass/the-history-of-the-electric-bass-part-1-early-days-507234&lt;/ref&gt; some [[jazz]] bass players began to use the [[bass guitar|electric bass guitar]] in place of the double bass. The electric bass, which was easier to amplify to loud volumes onstage, gained particular prominence in the late 1960s and early 1970s jazz subgenre which blended jazz with the powerfully amplified [[Music technology (electric)|electric instruments]] of [[rock music]], creating [[jazz fusion]].

Most jazz bassists specialize in either the double bass or the electric bass, although the ability to "double" (play both instruments) is common. A small number of players, such as [[Stanley Clarke]] and [[John Patitucci]], have achieved virtuoso skill on both instruments. Whether a jazz bassist is "[[comping]]" ([[accompaniment|accompanying]]) with a [[walking bass]]line or soloing, or playing on a double bass or an electric bass, they usually aim to create a rhythmic drive and "timefeel" that creates a sense of ''[[swing (jazz performance style)|swing]]'' and ''[[groove (music)|groove]]''. 

== Double bass ==
Beginning around 1890, the [[African-American]] communities in early [[New Orleans]] used a jazz ensemble which played a mixture of marches, [[ragtime]], and [[dixieland]] music. This ensemble was initially a [[marching band]] with [[sousaphone]] (or occasionally [[bass saxophone]]) supplying the bass line. As the music moved from playing for funerals on the street and into bars and [[brothel]]s, the double bass gradually replaced these wind instruments. Many early bassists doubled on both the "brass bass" and "string bass," as the instruments were then often referred to. Bassists played "walking" basslines—scale-based lines that outlined the harmony and provided a foundation for the tunes.

Because an unamplified double bass is generally the quietest instrument in a jazz band, many players of the 1920s and 1930s used the ''slap style'', [[Slapping (music)|slapping]] and pulling the strings to make a rhythmic "slap" sound against the fingerboard. The slap style cuts through the sound of a band better than simply plucking the strings, and make the bass more easily heard on early sound recordings, as the recording equipment of that time did not capture low frequencies well.&lt;ref name="fotos"&gt;[http://www.peterunbehauen.de/jazz/jazzfotos.html Historic Jazz Fotos]&lt;/ref&gt; For more about the slap style, see "Playing styles," below.

Double bass players who have contributed to the evolution of jazz include the Swing era player [[Jimmy Blanton]], who played with [[Duke Ellington]], and [[Oscar Pettiford]], who pioneered the instrument's soloistic use in [[Bebop]].  The "cool" style of jazz was influenced by players such as [[Scott LaFaro]] and [[Percy Heath]], whose solos were very melodic.

[[Paul Chambers]] (who worked with [[Miles Davis]] on the famous ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' album) achieved renown for being one of the early jazz bassists to play Bebop solos in arco (bowed) style. The first player known to do that was [[Slam Stewart]], who would scat in octaves with his bowed bass in his solos, good examples of which can be found on the trio recordings he made with [[Art Tatum]] and [[Tiny Grimes]]. [[Ron Carter]] (another bassist who worked with [[Miles Davis]] in his second great quintet), is credited as a key figure of the modern school of jazz bass playing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}He is one of the most-recorded bassists in jazz.

[[Free jazz]] was influenced by the composer/bassist [[Charles Mingus]] (who also contributed to [[hard bop]]) and [[Charlie Haden]], best known for his work with [[Ornette Coleman]]. In the 1950s, some [[big band]] [[bandleader]]s began to ask their upright players to use the then-newly available [[Fender bass]], the first widely available [[electric bass]]. In the 1970s, as jazz and [[rock music]] were blended by performers to create the "[[jazz fusion|fusion]]" genre, players such as [[Jaco Pastorius]] began to develop a unique sound using the electric bass.

Apart from jazz fusion and Latin-influenced jazz, the double bass is still widely used in jazz in the 2010s. The deep sound and woody tone of the plucked double bass is distinct from the sound of the fretted [[bass guitar]]. The bass guitar produces a different sound than the double bass, because its strings are usually stopped with the aid of metal [[fret]]s. As well, bass guitars usually have a solid wood body, which means that the sound is produced by [[Bass amp|electronic amplification]] of the vibration of the strings. The solid body upright, also known as a "stick" bass or "EUB" variation is still widely used by bass players in [[salsa music|salsa]] and [[timba]] bands, because its sound is so well suited to those styles. The EUB is smaller and lighter than a double bass, making touring and travelling easier, and its solid (or mostly solid) body enables bassists to play at a much higher volume with a [[bass amp]] without [[Audio feedback|feedback]].

=== Playing techniques ===
In jazz, since the 1950s, the double bass is usually played with [[bass instrument amplifier|amplification]] and it is mostly played with the fingers, ''[[pizzicato]]'' style, except during some solos, where players may use the bow. The pizzicato style varies between different players and genres. Some players perform with the sides of one, two, or three fingers, especially for [[walking bass]]lines and slow tempo ballads, because this is purported to create a stronger and more solid tone. Some players use the more nimble tips of the fingers to play fast-moving solo passages or to pluck lightly for quiet tunes.
[[File:Jazzbass.jpg|thumb|left|150 px |An example of pizzicato jazz bass technique.]]
Using amplification gives the player more control over the tone of the instrument, because amplifiers have equalization controls that can accentuate certain frequencies (often the bass frequencies) while de-accentuating some frequencies (often the high frequencies, so that there is less finger noise). While jazz double bass players use amplification, they typically use much smaller, lower-powered bass amplifiers and smaller [[speaker enclosure|speaker cabinet]]s than those used by an [[electric bass]] player playing in a [[jazz fusion]] show. An upright player performing at a small club may only bring a 1x12" combo amp to the gig. When a small jazz combo is playing in a small [[jazz club]], the double bass player may use only a modest amount of amplification, so that the audience is hearing a mixture of the natural acoustic tone and the amplified sound. Of course, if that same band plays on a huge [[jazz festival]] mainstage, all of the bass tone reaching the audience's ears will be from the [[sound reinforcement system]].

An unamplified acoustic bass' tone is limited by the frequency responsiveness of the instrument's hollow body, which means that the very low pitches may not be as loud as the higher pitches. With an amplifier and [[Graphic equalizer|equalization]] devices, a bass player can boost the low frequencies, which evens out the frequency response. As well, the use of an amplifier can increase the sustain of the instrument, which is particularly useful for accompaniment during [[ballad]]s and for melodic solos with long held notes. Like other acoustic instruments used with amplification, such as the jazz violin, a double bass is often plugged into a [[preamplifier]], impedance-matching device, and/or a [[DI unit|Direct Injection]] (DI box) box before it is routed to the [[PA system]], electronic effects, or the [[bass instrument amplifier]].

In traditional [[jazz]] and [[Swing (genre)|swing]] it is sometimes played in the ''[[Slapping (music)|slap style]]''. This is a vigorous version of pizzicato where the strings are "slapped" against the fingerboard between the main notes of the bass line, producing a [[snare drum]]-like percussive sound. The main notes are either played normally or by pulling the string away from the fingerboard and releasing it so that it bounces off the fingerboard, producing a distinctive percussive attack in addition to the expected pitch.  Notable slap style bass players, whose use of the technique was often highly syncopated and virtuosic, sometimes interpolate two, or even three more slaps in between notes of their bass line.

=== Variants ===
[[File:Aria swb02 5.jpg|thumb|right|120px|A five-string Electric Upright Bass ("EUB")]]

In both jazz and jazz fusion bands, some jazz bassists use a modified type of double bass called the [[electric upright bass]] (abbreviated '''EUB''' and sometimes also called '''stick bass'''). The stick bass is also widely used in [[salsa music|salsa]], because its volume and tone are especially suited to that style of music, even in studio recording. It is an electronically amplified version of the [[double bass]] that has a minimal or 'skeleton' body, which greatly reduces the size and weight of the instrument. The EUB retains enough of the features of the [[double bass]] so that double bass players are comfortable performing on it. While the EUB retains some of the tonal characteristics of the double bass, its electrically amplified nature also gives it its own unique sound. As well, an EUB is considerably easier to transport than its acoustic equivalent. The [[scale length (string instruments)|scale length]] of EUBs varies: some scales are 42", similar to most [[double bass]]es, whilst other models have scale lengths of only 30" like a short scale [[bass guitar]]. The shorter scale can make it easier for bass guitarists to convert to the EUB.

Solid bodied EUBs produce very little sound without [[bass instrument amplification|electronic amplification]]. Hollow-bodied EUBs produce a quiet tone that is loud enough for individual practice. However, since hollow-bodied EUBs do not have a large resonant cavity like a [[double bass]], they cannot reproduce the lowest notes of the instrument without an amplifier. To amplify the EUB, the [[Strings (music)|string]] [[oscillation|vibrations]] are sensed with a [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]].  Early EUBs used [[Pick up (music technology)#Magnetic pickups|magnetic pickups]] similar to those in electric guitars, or percussive magnetic diaghram pickups (e.g., the [[Ampeg]] "Baby Bass").  Many modern EUBs use [[Pick up (music technology)#Piezoelectric pickups|piezoelectric pickups]] located in the [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]] or a combination of pickup types. The signal from the pickup is usually preamplified and [[Equalization (audio)|equalized]] with a [[preamplifier]] and then sent to a [[bass instrument amplification|bass amplifier]] or a [[PA system]]. For silent practice in a hotel room or apartment, an EUB can also be connected to [[headphone]]s.

Preamplifiers and equalizers for acoustic instruments or double basses can also be used to "[[roll-off|roll off]]" the treble frequencies or "notch out" the "scratchy-sounding" frequencies. Since the EUB typically does not have a hollow sound chamber, or only includes a small sound chamber, the EUB is less prone to [[audio feedback]] than the double bass when amplified.  To use a bow with an EUB, both the bridge and fingerboard must be [[radius]]sed (given a curve). EUBs are much easier to transport to gigs, or fly with on tours than a large, fragile double bass.

== Electric bass ==

The [[electric bass]] is a relative newcomer to the world of [[jazz]]. Until the 1950s, the double bass was used to anchor jazz ensembles from small combos to huge [[big band]]s. The electric bass was introduced in the early 1950s when Roy Johnson (and later [[Monk Montgomery]]) first used the instrument in [[Lionel Hampton]]'s [[big band]].&lt;ref name="musicradar.com"/&gt; When the electric bass is used in [[jazz]], it has both an accompaniment and a soloing role. When the bass is used to accompany, it may be used to perform [[walking bass]]lines for traditional tunes and ''[[jazz standards]]'', in smooth quarter note lines that imitate the sound of the double bass. 

The electric bass player can play all of the same types of [[bass line]]s played by her upright bass cousin. However, due to the design of the electric bass as a [[guitar]]-family instrument, it is possible to play rapid bass lines that would be impossible on an upright bass. For example, an electric bassist in a fusion or Latin band can play a bassline composed entirely of rapid, [[syncopation|syncopated]] sixteenth notes.  For [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] or [[salsa music|salsa]] tunes and rock-infused jazz fusion tunes, the electric bass may play challenging, fast-moving rhythmic figures in coordination with the drummer, or lay down a low, heavy groove. 

In a fusion band, electric bass players have to provide a solid, heavy bass foundation for the band while a drummer, [[electric guitar]]ist (amplified through a [[guitar amp]]) and [[synthesizer]] or [[electric piano]] player performing (amplified through a [[keyboard amp]]) are all playing. As well, fusion bands are more likely to play a rock-size venue, such as a large club or theatre, than a small jazz club. To provide a good bass sound, a fusion electric bass player will often use a powerful [[bass amplifier]] and a larger [[speaker enclosure|speaker cabinet]] than an upright player would use, such as a 4X10" cabinet, or even two 4X10" cabinets.
 
In a jazz setting, the electric bass tends to have much a much more expansive solo role than in most popular styles. In most rock settings, the bass guitarist may only have a few short [[bass break]]s or brief solos during a concert. During a jazz concert, a jazz bassist may have a number of lengthy improvised solos, which are called "blowing" in jazz parlance. Among those who have spearheaded the bass guitar in jazz are [[Jaco Pastorius]], [[Victor Wooten]], and [[Marcus Miller]].

=== Fretted and fretless basses ===
[[File:JackBruce &amp; fretless bass.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Jack Bruce playing a fretless [[Warwick (bass guitar)|Warwick]] Thumb bass at the Jazzfestival Frankfurt, Germany  28 October 2006]]

One of the options for bass guitarists is whether to use an instrument with [[fret]]s on the fingerboard or not. On a fretted bass, metal frets divide the fingerboard into [[semitone]] divisions (as on a guitar). The original Fender basses had 20 frets, but modern basses may have 24 or more. [[Fretless bass]]es have a distinct sound, because the absence of frets means that the string must be pressed down directly onto the wood of the fingerboard as with the [[double bass]]. The string buzzes against the wood and is somewhat muted because the sounding portion of the string is in direct contact with the flesh of the player's finger.  The fretless bass allows players to use the expressive devices of [[glissando]], [[vibrato]] and microtonal intonations such as [[quarter tone]]s and [[just intonation]]. 

In a small combo, the bass player may alone determine which type of bass to use and for which tunes. In a band with a [[bandleader]], the leader may provide guidance on what tunes are best suited to each type of bass. Some bassists use both fretted and fretless basses in performances, according to the type of material they are performing. While fretless basses are often associated with [[jazz]] and [[jazz fusion]], bassists from other genres use fretless basses, such as metal bassist [[Steve DiGiorgio]].

[[File:Flatwound 01.JPG|thumb|175px|left|Fretless basses are often used by [[jazz fusion]] bass guitar players; this fretless bass has flatwound strings; note the markers inlaid into the side of the fingerboard, to aid the performer in finding the correct pitch.]]

[[Bill Wyman]] takes credit for creating the first fretless bass guitar in 1961 when he converted an inexpensive Japanese fretted bass by removing the frets.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Jim (2001). 'How The Fender Bass Changed the World' or Jon Sievert interview with [[Bill Wyman]]., guitar player magazine December (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This fretless bass can be heard on [[The Rolling Stones]] songs such as "Paint it Black".&lt;/ref&gt; The first production fretless bass was the Ampeg AUB-1 introduced in 1966, and Fender introduced a fretless Precision Bass in 1970. In the early 1970s, fusion-jazz bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]] created his own fretless bass by removing the frets&lt;ref&gt;In interviews, Pastorius gave various versions of how he accomplished this; the versions mention the use of [[pliers]], a [[putty knife]], and, in at least one interview (''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine, 1984) he states that he bought the instrument with the frets already removed, badly, with the slots where the frets once were not yet filled in.&lt;/ref&gt; from a Fender Jazz Bass, filling the holes with wood putty, and coating the fretboard with epoxy resin.

Pastorius used epoxy rather than varnish to obtain a glass-like finish suitable for the use of roundwound strings, which are otherwise much harder on the wood of the fingerboard. Some fretless basses have "fret line" markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide, while others only use guide marks on the side of the neck. Tapewound (double bass type) and flatwound strings are sometimes used with the fretless bass so that the metal string windings do not wear down the [[fingerboard]]. Some fretless basses have epoxy-coated fingerboards to increase durability, enhance [[sustain]], and give a brighter tone. Though most fretless basses have four strings, five-string and six-string fretless basses are also available. Fretless basses with more than six strings are also available as "boutique" or custom-made instruments.

== Alternative instruments ==
While the majority of jazz and jazz fusion recordings and live performances use either the double bass (or a related instrument such as an [[electric upright bass]]) or the electric bass to supply the "low end", there are some exceptions. In jazz [[organ trio]]s, a [[Hammond organ]] player performs the basslines using the [[bass pedalboard]] or their lower manual, along with a drummer and a saxophonist. In some jazz fusion groups, the basslines may be played by a keyboard player on a [[bass synthesizer]] or other keyboard. As well, in some duos and other small groups, the basslines may be provided by a piano player; in a duo consisting of a jazz pianist and a jazz singer, the piano player plays a bassline with the left hand and chords in the right hand underneath the singer's voice. Similarly, in some duos or trios, a jazz guitarist may play basslines, a role that is especially feasible if the guitarist has a seven-string guitar with a low "B" string. In traditional [[Dixieland]] or New Orleans-style jazz groups, the basslines may be played by a [[tuba]] or other low brass instrument.

The '''Langlois Bridge at Arles''' is the subject of four oil paintings, one watercolor and four drawings by [[Vincent van Gogh]].  The works, made in 1888 when Van Gogh lived in [[Arles]], in [[southern France]],  represent a melding of formal and creative aspects.  Van Gogh leverages a [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] frame that he built and used in [[The Hague]] to create precise lines and angles when portraying perspective.

Van Gogh was influenced by [[Japanese art|Japanese]] [[woodcut print]]s, as evidenced by his simplified use of color to create a harmonious and unified image.  Contrasting colors, such as blue and yellow, were used to bring a vibrancy to the works.  He painted with an [[impasto]], or thickly applied paint, using color to depict the reflection of light. The subject matter, a drawbridge on a canal, reminded him of his homeland in the [[Netherlands]]. He asked his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] to frame and send one of the paintings to an art dealer in the Netherlands. The reconstructed [[Langlois Bridge]] is now named ''[[Langlois Bridge|Pont Van-Gogh]]''.

==Background==

===Arles===
Van Gogh was 35 when he made the Langlois Bridge paintings and drawings.  Living in [[Arles]], in [[southern France]], he was at the height of his career, producing some of his best work:&lt;ref name=Morton&gt;Morton, 177-178.&lt;/ref&gt; [[sunflowers (series of paintings)|sunflowers]], [[Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series)|fields]], farmhouses and people of the Arles, [[Nîmes]] and [[Avignon]] areas.&lt;ref name=Arfin&gt;Arfin, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a prolific time for Van Gogh: in less than 15 months&lt;ref&gt;Shoham, 142.&lt;/ref&gt; he made about 100 drawings, produced more than 200 paintings and wrote more than 200 letters.&lt;ref name=NGAsun&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effects of the Sun in Provence |journal=National Gallery of Art Picturing France (1830-1900) |page=131 (12 of pdf) |publisher=National Gallery of Art |location=Washington, D.C. |url=http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |accessdate=2011-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512000557/http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[canal]]s, [[drawbridge]]s, [[windmill]]s, [[Thatching|thatched cottages]] and expansive fields of the Arles countryside reminded Van Gogh of his life in the [[Netherlands]]. Arles brought him the solace and bright sun that he sought for himself and conditions to explore painting with more vivid colors, intense color contrasts and varied brushstrokes.  He also returned to the roots of his artistic training from the [[Netherlands]], most notably with the use of a [[reed pen]] for his drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 60—61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Langlois Bridge===
{{main|Langlois Bridge}}
[[File:Van gogh bruecke 1902.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The original drawbridge, 1902. It was replaced by a reinforced-concrete bridge in 1930. At Van Gogh's time, it was called ''Pont de Langlois'', Langlois' bridge, after its bridge keeper. The bridge has been relocated and renamed ''Pont Van-Gogh'']]
The Langlois Bridge was one of the crossings over the Arles to [[Port-de-Bouc|Bouc]] canal.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; It was built in the first half of the 19th century to expand the network of canals to the [[Mediterranean sea|Mediterranean Sea]].  [[Lock (water transport)|Locks]] and bridges were built, too, to manage water and road traffic. Just outside Arles, the first bridge was the officially titled "Pont de Réginel" but better known by the keeper's name as "Pont de Langlois".&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VGM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=3761&amp;collection=451&amp;lang=en |title=The Langlois Bridge |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-04-28 |postscript='  See 'Ropes' and 'Something Funny' sections of the page for more information.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, the original drawbridge was replaced by a reinforced concrete structure which, in 1944, was blown up by the retreating Germans who destroyed all the other bridges along the canal except for the one at [[Fos-sur-Mer]], a port on the [[Mediterranean sea|Mediterranean Sea]].  The Fos Bridge was dismantled in 1959 with a view to relocating it on the site of the Langlois Bridge but as a result of structural difficulties, it was finally reassembled at Montcalde Lock several kilometers away from the original site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.patrimoine.ville-arles.fr/images/document/canal%20Arles%20Bouc%20Rimeur.pdf |author=Rimeur, L | title=Note sur le canal d'Arles à Bouc | pages=43–44 |date=December 1981 – March 1982 |  accessdate=2011-05-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929041232/http://www.patrimoine.ville-arles.fr/images/document/canal%20Arles%20Bouc%20Rimeur.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-29|work=Bulletin des Amis du Vieil Arles|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://projetbabel.org/fluvial/rica_arles-bouc-canal.htm |title=Canal d'Arles à Bouc | work=Projet Babel | accessdate=2011-05-14|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to letters to his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], Van Gogh began a study of women washing clothes near the Langlois Bridge about mid-March 1888&lt;ref name=L469/&gt; and was working on another painting of the bridge about April 2.&lt;ref name=L473&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/473.htm |title=Vincent van Gogh. Letter to Theo van Gogh. Written c. 2 April 1888 in Arles. |editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits |accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first of several versions he painted of the Langlois Bridge that crossed the Arles canal.&lt;ref name=VGM/&gt;

Reflecting on Van Gogh's works of the Langlois Bridge [[Debora Silverman]], author of the book ''Van Gogh and Gauguin: The Search for Sacred Art'' comments, "Van Gogh's depictions of the bridge have been considered a quaint exercise in nostalgia mingled with [[Japonism|Japonist]] allusions." Van Gogh approached the making of the paintings and drawings about the bridge in a "serious and sustained manner" with attention to "the structure, function, and component parts of this craft mechanism in the landscape."&lt;ref name=Silverman69&gt;Silverman, 69-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perspective frame===
In Arles Van Gogh began using again a [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] frame he had built in [[The Hague]].  The device was used for outdoor sightings to compare the proportion of items that were near to those that were in the distance.  Some of the works of the Langlois Bridge were made with the aid of the frame. Its use "deepened his exploration of the drawbridge as a mechanism."&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 62, 63, 74, 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese influence===
The Langlois Bridge reminded Van Gogh of [[Hiroshige]]'s print ''[[:File:Hiroshige Van Gogh 2.JPG|Sudden Shower on the Great Bridge]]''.&lt;ref name=Mancoff61&gt;Mancoff, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Inspired by the [[Japanese art|Japanese]] [[woodcut print|wood block prints]], Van Gogh sought to integrate techniques from Japanese artwork into his own. In a letter to [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]] about the Langlois Bridge, he wrote: "If the Japanese are not making any progress in their own country, still it cannot be doubted that their art is being continued in France."  With a Japanese aesthetic, Van Gogh's Langlois Bridge paintings reflect a simplified use of color to create a harmonious and unified image.  Outlines were used to suggest movement. He used fewer shades of colors, preferring multiple subtle color variations. The Langlois Bridge reminded Van Gogh of [[Hiroshige]]'s ''Sudden Shower on the Great Bridge'' inspiring him to use blocks of colors, like patterns of yellow against a blue sky, colors chosen to create a sense of vitality&lt;ref name=Mancoff61/&gt; of the Japanese prints and the vibrant quality of light in  southern France.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches created a more powerful impact and depicted the simpler, primitive quality of the country lifestyle.&lt;ref name=Maurer63&gt;Maurer, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three paintings with similar compositions==
''The Langlois Bridge at Arles with Women Washing'' is one of van Gogh's most iconic and best loved paintings, acknowledged as the first masterpiece of his Arles period.&lt;ref&gt;Hulsker (1986), 308&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts common canal-side activities.  A little yellow cart crosses the bridge while a group of women in smocks and multicoloured caps wash linen on the shore.&lt;ref name=L469&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/469.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, Arles, c. 14 March 1888 |editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits |accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=L473/&gt;  Van Gogh skillfully uses his knowledge of [[color theory]] and the "law of simultaneous contrasts"&lt;ref&gt;Fell, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; in this work.  The grass is depicted with alternating brush strokes of red-orange and green.  Yellow and blue [[complementary color]]s are used in the bridge, sky and river.  Use of complementary colors intensifies the impact of each color creating a "vibrant and coloristically unified whole."&lt;ref name=Mauer64/&gt;

Naomi Mauer, author of ''The Pursuit of Spiritual Wisdom: The Thought and Art of Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin'' describes Van Gogh's technical and artistic execution of this painting. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Compositionally, the vertical and horizontal geometry of the bridge and its reflection in the water create a great central cross which imparts a classical symmetry and equilibrium to the canvas.  This central geometric framework, which is echoed and enclosed by the bands of sky above and the bank below, is relieved and enlivened by the great undulating sweep of the hill and shore, the round knot of washerwomen amid the circular ripples of the water, and the flexible, slightly curved grasses at the right.  Both formally and chromatically, the ''Bridge of Langlois'' demonstrates Vincent's abstraction of nature to its essential coloristic and formal elements, and his creation from these components of a harmoniously interwoven unity in which humanity and its works are perfectly integrated."&lt;ref name=Mauer64&gt;Maurer, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For ''The Langlois Bridge at Arles (watercolor)'' Van Gogh manages to create precise details of the bridge, such as the hardware, iron supports, braces and chain pulleys with watercolor.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two other paintings==

===''The Langlois Bridge at Arles with Road alongside the Canal''===
Van Gogh used varying techniques when he created the painting, depending upon the subject and what he wanted to convey.  The grass and the path in the foreground were painted rapidly.  The bridge, though, was painted in greater detail,&lt;ref name=VGM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 71-75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/popup.jsp?page=3768 |title=Detail, The Langlois Bridge |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; with clearly defined stone piers and wooden beams.  The detail in the ropes used to lift the roadway show that they are attached to the wooden lifting gear.  Van Gogh also pays close attention to the reflection of the bridge in the water.  In the distance is another drawbridge.&lt;ref name=VGM/&gt;

Van Gogh claimed the painting as "something funny... I will not create every day."&lt;ref name=VGM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hulsker, 308.&lt;/ref&gt; There was something about the setting for this painting that reminded him of his homeland.&lt;ref name=Arfin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  He asked his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] to frame an earlier version of the painting in blue and gold (blue in the front, gold on the side) and offer it to an art-dealer in the Netherlands,&lt;ref name=VGM /&gt; named Tersteeg.&lt;ref name=L473 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Naifeh, Smith (2011), 578&lt;/ref&gt; Tersteeg knew Van Gogh and his brother Theo when they lived in The Hague.  He nurtured Van Gogh's early artistic interests but their relationship suffered after Van Gogh lived with a prostitute named [[Sien (Van Gogh series)|Sien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=7822&amp;lang=en |title=Van Gogh and Tersteeg|work=Permanent Collection |publisher= Van Gogh Museum | accessdate = 2011-04-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915004414/http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=7822&amp;lang=en|archivedate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Van Gogh Museum]] claims that the painting is the last in a series of three,&lt;ref name=VGM/&gt; yet Silverman has identified four oil paintings and a fifth watercolor, as outlined in this article.&lt;ref name= Silverman69 /&gt;

===''The Langlois Bridge at Arles''===
[[Wallraf-Richartz Museum|Wallraf-Richartz Museum's]] ''Langlois Bridge at Arles'' depicts a woman holding an umbrella as she crosses the [[Langlois Bridge]], following a horse and buggy that just crossed the bridge.  The water in the canal subtly reflects the bridge and the few clouds in the sky.  Van Gogh uses [[impasto]] paint and color to reflect light, much as we would see it in with our eye. Two tall cypress trees and a white house flank the drawbridge which has a moveable center section between stone abutments.&lt;ref&gt;Perkowitz, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is currently at the [[Wallraf-Richartz Museum]] in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/281/Langlois-Bridge-at-Arles,-The.html |title=Langlois Bridge at Arles, The |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Paintings |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Drawings==
Soon after arriving in Arles Van Gogh asked his brother to send him a copy of Armand Cassagne's ''Guide to the Alphabet of Drawing''.  His request was generated by an interest to return to foundational drawing practices, such as his use of a perspective frame for the drawings and paintings that he made of Langlois Bridge.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 61-64.&lt;/ref&gt; A letter dated March 18, 1888, to his friend Émile Bernard contains a sketch of the bridge (JH 1370 below) and the color scheme he is considering adopting, clearly showing his use of sketching and drawing as a preliminary to his painting. He spoke of how the town (Arles) "projects the strange silhouette of its drawbridge against a huge yellow sun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2009/11/langlois-bridge.html | title=Langlos Bridge, Letters of Note | accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances in Other Media==
[[Arthur C. Clarke]] made reference to Van Gogh's ''Bridge at Arles'' in his novel ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. In it the character [[David Bowman (Space Odyssey)|David Bowman]] notices the painting (along with [[Andrew Wyeth]]'s ''[[Christina's World]]'') when observing the living room of "an elegant, anonymous hotel suite" after travelling through the Stargate.

Argentine musician [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]] referenced the painting in "Cantata de puentes amarillos" ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "[[Cantata]] of yellow bridges"), one of his most celebrated songs. Spinetta came to Van Gogh's letters to Theo through his reading of the essay ''Van Gogh, The Man Suicided'' by [[Antonin Artaud]]. The track is the centerpiece of his 1973 record ''[[Artaud (album)|Artaud]]'', named after the poet, which is generally considered the greatest album in [[Argentine rock]] history.&lt;ref name="MDZ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdzol.com/opinion/483838/|language=Spanish|title=Artaud, Spinetta y 40 años de belleza|date=2013-08-17|accessdate=2018-01-06|publisher=[[MDZ Online]]|last=Gazzo|first=Walter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting  is also featured on the 30th season of ''The Amazing Race'', where as part of the detour challenge, teams will find this painting, which in reality is a elaborate sliding puzzle, requiring them to slide elements of the painting in a specific sequence in order to unlock the [[easel]] and retrieve their clue inside.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18747">This is a list of '''scholarly publishing "[[sting operation]]s"''' such as the [[Sokal affair]]. These are nonsense papers that were accepted by an [[academic journal]] or [[academic conference]]; the list does not include cases of [[scientific misconduct]]. The intent of such publications is typically to expose shortcomings in a journal's [[Academic peer review|peer review]] process or to criticize the standards of [[Predatory open access publishing|pay-to-publish]] journals.

==Mathematics==
* In 2012, the [[open-access journal]] ''Advances in Pure Mathematics'' accepted a nonsense paper produced by the computer program Mathgen. Although the paper was accepted, the "author" declined to pay the journal's $500 publishing fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eldredge|first1=Nate|title=Mathgen paper accepted!|url=http://thatsmathematics.com/blog/archives/102|website=That's Mathematics!|accessdate=21 May 2017|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer science==
* A paper randomly generated by the [[SCIgen]] program was accepted without peer-review for presentation at the 2005 [[World Multiconference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics]] (WMSCI). The conference announced the prank of having accepted the article as not [[peer review]]ed, despite none of the three assigned peer-reviewers having submitted an opinion about its fidelity, veracity, or accuracy to its subject. The three [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] graduate students who wrote the hoax article said they were unaware of the [[Sokal Affair]] until after submitting their article. Subsequently, numerous other papers generated by SCIgen have been published in scientific journals or accepted for presentation at scientific conferences.
* In December 2013, a [[Pune]]-based software professional submitted a bogus paper titled "use of cloud-computing and social media to determine box office performance", which was accepted by the [[Bhubaneswar]]-based Research Forum for their ICRIEST-AICEEMCS International Conference. The paper's introductory section itself cautioned that it contained some "gibberish" that was auto-generated by software. One section of the paper also includes 19 lines about the 1970s Bollywood film ''[[Sholay]]'', and 19 lines from ''[[My Cousin Vinny]]'', a 1992 Hollywood film. The incident highlighted a practice where "poor quality papers are accepted from students who are then asked to pay a few thousand rupees to participate in the conferences". After that the management of the event retracted the paper and apologized publicly. The Secretary in an interview described the acceptance as a human error of the coordinators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140103/jsp/frontpage/story_17747127.jsp|title=Throw in F-word and become paper tiger|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2014 an Australian computer scientist Dr Peter Vamplew submitted a paper to the International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology (IJACT) after being angered that the journal would not take his email off its mailing list. The article, titled "[[Get me off your fucking mailing list|Get me off your fucking mailing list]]", consisted of the phrase "Get me off your fucking mailing list" being repeated for the entirety of the article body. The journal requested the researcher to "add some more recent references and do a bit of reformatting" saying that the article's "suitability for the journal was excellent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/nov/25/journal-accepts-paper-requesting-removal-from-mailing-list|title=Journal accepts bogus paper requesting removal from mailing list|last=Safi|first=Michael|date=2014-11-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Christoph Bartneck, an [[Associate Professor]] in [[Information Technology]] at New Zealand's [[University of Canterbury]], was invited to submit a paper to the 2016 International Conference on Atomic and Nuclear Physics organised by [[ConferenceSeries]]. With little knowledge of nuclear physics, he used [[iOS]]'s auto-complete function to write the paper, choosing randomly from its suggestions after starting each sentence,&lt;ref name="HuntNonsense"/&gt; and submitted it under the name Iris Pear (a reference to [[Siri]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]).&lt;ref name="HIT"&gt;{{cite web|title=iOS Just Got A Paper On Nuclear Physics Accepted At A Scientific Conference|first=Christoph|last=Bartneck|date=20 October 2016|accessdate=22 October 2016|publisher=[[University of Canterbury]] Human Interface Technology (HIT) Lab, New Zealand|url=http://www.bartneck.de/2016/10/20/ios-just-got-a-paper-on-nuclear-physics-accepted-at-a-scientific-conference/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sample sentence from the abstract for the resulting manuscript was: "The atoms of a better universe will have the right for the same as you are the way we shall have to be a great place for a great time to enjoy the day you are a wonderful person to your great time to take the fun and take a great time and enjoy the great day you will be a wonderful time for your parents and kids"&lt;ref name="HuntNonsense"/&gt; and the 516-word abstract contained the words "good" and "great" a combined total of 28 times (and is available online).&lt;ref name="HIT"/&gt; Despite making no sense, the work was accepted within three hours of submission and a conference registration fee of US$1099 requested.&lt;ref name="HuntNonsense"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HIT"/&gt; The incident was compared to an earlier case where Peter Vamplew, from [[Federation University Australia|Federation University]] in Victoria, had a manuscript containing only the phrase "[[Get me off your fucking mailing list]]" accepted by the [[International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology]].&lt;ref name="HuntNonsense"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nonsense paper written by iOS autocomplete accepted for conference|first=Elle|last=Hunt|date=22 October 2016|accessdate=22 October 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/22/nonsense-paper-written-by-ios-autocomplete-accepted-for-conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Journal accepts bogus paper requesting removal from mailing list|first=Michael|last=Safi|date=25 November 2014|accessdate=22 October 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/nov/25/journal-accepts-paper-requesting-removal-from-mailing-list}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ConferenceSeries is associated with the [[OMICS Publishing Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bogus British Company "Accredits" OMICS Conferences|first=Jeffrey|last=Beall|authorlink=Jeffrey Beall|url=https://scholarlyoa.com/2016/10/13/bogus-british-company-accredits-omics-conferences/#comment-425306|date=13 October 2016|accessdate=22 October 2016|publisher=[[Scholarly Open Access]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106003123/https://scholarlyoa.com/2016/10/13/bogus-british-company-accredits-omics-conferences/#comment-425306|archivedate=6 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which produces [[open access journals]] widely regarded as [[predatory open access publishing|predatory]], and has been accused of moving into "predatory meetings".&lt;ref name="Beall"&gt;{{cite web|title=OMICS Goes from "Predatory Publishing" to "Predatory Meetings" |first1=Jeffrey |last1=Beall |first2=Richard |last2=Levine |authorlink1=Jeffrey Beall |authorlink2=Richard Levine |url=https://scholarlyoa.com/2013/01/25/omics-predatory-meetings/ |date=25 January 2013 |accessdate=22 October 2016 |publisher=[[Scholarly Open Access]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605042104/https://scholarlyoa.com/2013/01/25/omics-predatory-meetings/ |archivedate=5 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bartneck said he was "reasonably certain that this is a money-making conference with little to no commitment to science," given the poor quality of the review process and the high cost of attendance.&lt;ref name="HuntNonsense"/&gt;

==Chemistry==
* "[[Who's Afraid of Peer Review?]]": In 2013 [[John Bohannon]] wrote in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' about a "[[sting operation]]" he conducted in which he submitted "a credible but mundane scientific paper, one with such grave errors that a competent peer reviewer should easily identify it as flawed and unpublishable", to 304 open-access publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bohannon|first=John|title=Who's Afraid of Peer Review?|journal=Science|date=4 October 2013|volume=342|issue=6154|pages=60–65|doi=10.1126/science.342.6154.60|pmid=24092725|bibcode=2013Sci...342...60B}}&lt;/ref&gt; 157 journals accepted the paper. There have been some objections to the sting's methodology and about what conclusions can be drawn from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Mike|title=Anti-tutorial: how to design and execute a really bad study|url=http://svpow.com/2013/10/07/anti-tutorial-how-to-design-and-execute-a-really-bad-study/|work=Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week|accessdate=14 October 2013|author2=Matt Wedell|author3=Darren Naish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Kevin|title=The big picture about peer-review|url=http://blogs.library.duke.edu/scholcomm/2013/10/10/the-big-picture-about-peer-review/|work=Scholarly Communications @ Duke|publisher=Duke University Libraries|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine==
* John McLachlan, a professor of medical education, hoaxed the Jerusalem Conference on Integrative Medicine in 2010 with invented nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6979|title=Integrative medicine and the point of credulity|date=8 December 2010|publisher=The BMJ|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
* In 2007 [[Tomasz Witkowski]] published a fake article in the psychology journal ''[[Charaktery]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Witkowski|first1=Tomasz|title=Psychological Sokal's Style Hoax|journal=The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practices|date=2011|volume=8|issue=1|pages=50–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witkowski|first1=Tomasz|last2=Zatonski|first2=Maciej|title=Psychology Gone Wrong: The Dark Sides of Science and Therapy|date=2015|publisher=BrownWalker Press|isbn=1-62734-528-0|pages=259–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Randi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Randi|first1=James|title=Sokal Re-created|url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/142-swift-december-21-2007.html#i3|publisher=JREF|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other science bloggers covered the hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grivan|first1=Ray|title=Polish Sokal-style hoax|url=http://poorpothecary.blogspot.com/2007/11/polish-sokal-style-hoax.html|website=Poor Pothecary|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wanderer in the country of blindfolded|title=Polish 'Sokal hoax'|url=http://countryofblindfolded.blogspot.com/2007/11/polish-sokal-hoax.html|website=Random journeys through Science|date=6 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interdisciplinary and cultural studies==
* The [[Sokal affair]]: [[Alan Sokal]], a [[physics]] professor at [[New York University]] and [[University College London]], wrote a paper titled "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity]&lt;/ref&gt; which proposed that [[quantum gravity]] is a social and linguistic construct. The paper was published in the ''Social Text'' spring/summer 1996 "[[Science Wars]]" issue. At that time, the journal did not practice [[academic peer review]] and it did not submit the article for outside expert review by a physicist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html|title=Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity|accessdate=3 April 2007|last=Sokal|first=Alan D.|date=28 November 1994|work=[[Social Text]] #46/47 (spring/summer 1996)|publisher=[[Duke University]] Press|pages=217–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]|url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9607/mst.html|title=Mystery science theater|author1=Bruce Robbins|author2=Andrew Ross|date=July 1996}}. Reply by Alan Sokal.&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of its publication in May 1996, Sokal revealed in ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' that the article was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html|title=A Physicist Experiments with Cultural Studies|last=Sokal|first=Alan D.|work=''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]''|date=5 June 1996|accessdate= 2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Michel Maffesoli#Sociétés hoax|Sociétés hoax]]: Using a false identity, Manuel Quinon and Arnaud Saint-Martin submitted an intentionally inept and absurd article on the "[[Autolib']]", a small rentable car in [[Paris]], to [[Michel Maffesoli]]'s ''Sociétés'' journal. The article was deliberately incoherent and plastered with liberal quotes and references to Maffesoli and other postmodern thinkers. The article was duly "reviewed" by two people, before being accepted and published in ''Sociétés'' without any substantial editing.
* In May 2017, [[Peter Boghossian]] and James Lindsay published an absurd paper in the [[open access journal]] ''Cogent Social Sciences'' which argued that the penis is best understood not as a biological organ but rather as a social construct. The paper came to an absurd conclusion that the conceptual penis is a "driver behind much of climate change" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindsay|first=Jamie|last2=Boyle|first2=Peter|date=|title=The conceptual penis as a social construct|url=http://www.skeptic.com/downloads/conceptual-penis/23311886.2017.1330439.pdf|journal=Open Access Journal|volume=|page=6|pages=|via=Skeptic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The authors' goal was to expose bias towards extreme ideologies in social science and gender studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boghossian|first1=Peter|last2=Lindsay|first2=James|title=The conceptual penis as a social construct: a Sokal-style hoax on gender studies|url=http://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/conceptual-penis-social-contruct-sokal-style-hoax-on-gender-studies/|website=Skeptic|accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the sting operation argue that it did not demonstrate the existence of such biases, despite the authors' goals of doing so. Phil Torres of ''Salon'', for example, argued that the sting shows only that academic journals that require authors to pay for papers to be published have a financial inclination "to accept papers regardless of quality." He also noted that none of the editorial board members of ''Cogent Social Sciences'' have expertise in gender studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.salon.com/2017/05/22/why-the-conceptual-penis-hoax-was-a-bust-it-only-reveals-the-lack-of-skepticism-among-skeptics/ |title=Why the “Conceptual Penis” hoax was a bust: It only reveals the lack of skepticism among skep... |last=Torres |first=Phil |date=2017-05-22 |work=Salon |access-date=2018-01-23 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James E. McWilliams]] criticized the authors' motives, writing that "Boghossian and Lindsay are white men working in the most male-dominated academic fields (philosophy and math) attempting to humiliate through bullying one of the few academic fields dominated by women. In our current political climate—thriving as it does on shamelessness and humiliation—this scenario, as the motives become increasingly transparent, only calls for kind of scrutiny and understanding that gender studies can provide."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://psmag.com/education/the-hoax-that-backfired-how-an-attempt-to-discredit-gender-studies-will-only-strengthen-it |title=The Hoax That Backfired: How an Attempt to Discredit Gender Studies Will Only Strengthen It |last=McWilliams |first=James |date=2017-05-31 |work=Pacific Standard |access-date=2018-01-23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [["Grievance Studies" affair]] (also referred to as the ""Sokal Squared" Scandal (or Hoax)" by the news media): Over 2017-2018 Helen Pluckrose, James A. Lindsay and [[Peter Boghossian]] wrote 20 hoax articles; at the time the hoax stopped, four papers had been published, three had been accepted but not yet published, seven were under review, and six had been rejected. The papers all focused on what the authors called “grievance studies" related to race, gender, sexuality and other forms of identity. The hoax was revealed and halted after one of the papers in the [[feminist geography]] journal ''[[Gender, Place and Culture]]'' was criticized on social media, and then on ''[[Campus Reform]]'', which led a ''Wall Street Journal'' editorial writer to investigate and report on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schuessler |first1=Jennifer |title=Hoaxers Slip Breastaurants and Dog-Park Sex Into Journals |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/arts/academic-journals-hoax.html |work=The New York Times |date=October 4, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper, which was in the process of being retracted when the ''Wall Street Journal'' story broke, referred to dog parks as "petri dishes for canine [[rape culture]]". The report also described a paper published in ''[[Affilia]]'' which contained a reworded excerpt from ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/fake-news-comes-to-academia-1538520950|title=Fake news comes to academia|author=Jillian Kay Melchior|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=2018-10-02|accessdate=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
* Dr. [[Maarten Boudry]], a [[Philosophy|philosopher]], in 2012 persuaded two [[theology]] conferences to accept abstracts composed of meaningless [[word salad]] as a paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/dispatches/2012/09/28/philosopher-pulls-a-sokal-on-theology-conferences/|title=Philosopher Pulls a Sokal on Theology Conferences|author=Ed Brayton|work=Dispatches from the Culture Wars|accessdate=3 October 2014|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.newhumanist.org.uk/2012/09/atheist-philospher-pulls-soakl-style.html|title=Atheist philosopher pulls Sokal-style hoax on theology conference|work=New Humanist Blog|publisher=Rationalist Association|accessdate=15 September 2014|date=25 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928014134/http://blog.newhumanist.org.uk/2012/09/atheist-philospher-pulls-soakl-style.html#|archive-date=2012-09-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computer and video game collector and limited editions''' (commonly referred to as CE and LE's) are [[video games]] packaged with [[Special edition|bonus materials and enhancements]] not available in the standard release.  Such bonuses can range from special packaging to printed artwork to extra discs containing additional content.  These versions are typically of a predetermined limited release and act as promotional tools for the publisher, and items of value for collectors.&lt;ref&gt;"For the Fans: ''GI'' Looks into Limited Editions," ''Game Informer'' 179 (March 2008): 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--'''Before making additions please note the following paragraph'''--&gt;Not all titles released as a "Special/Collector's/Etc. Edition" are necessarily in any substantial way superior to the standard edition. True Collector's and Limited Editions are those released with extra materials or content, that were limited in every case.  &lt;!--It also only refers to titles released for the North American market, to help control the size of the list. The Japanese market, for example, has many dozens of titles receive an LE release every year. (Source?)--&gt; For example, most [[Game of the Year]], Gold, or Platinum editions are [[Reissue|re-releases]] and rarely contain anything of extra value nor are of particular limited release, and thus are not generally considered Collector's or Limited Editions. &lt;!--Feel free to use the discussion page if you are unsure about a potential addition.--&gt;

| ''' ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' Limited Edition
| DC
| The Limited Edition of Sonic Adventure was a pre-release version of the game distributed to stores and rental locations, it did not include any bonus content. The Limited Edition of Sonic Adventure was originally distributed to approximately 400 Funcoland locations as a disc-only release to be used in Dreamcast kiosks promoting the upcoming release of the console. These discs included a trimmed down version of the game based on the Japanese release and had saving and network connectivity disabled along with other minor differences; they were known to be buggy.

Later, a variant of the release was distributed to Hollywood Video as part of a pre-release promotion in which the game could be rented along with a console before it's official launch. This variant of the game allowed saving and included a case and manual. The disc, game manual cover, and spine of the case all state “Limited Edition” and the artwork differs slightly from the standard edition release. Due to its exclusive distribution through a rental chain many of the original game cases were lost or destroyed and replaced in whole or in part with cases or manuals from the standard edition release, also many discs were tagged with a “Hollywood Video” security sticker.

'''The Liszt Collection''' contains over one million, generally nineteenth-century [[engraving]]s and images. The Liszt Collection is an international project to preserve a portrayal of history through contemporary engravings, articles and books. 

The Liszt Collection mainly covers Europe and the United States as well as other locations in the rest of the world, such as Canada, Australia, certain African countries, and South America and Asia.

The main areas of interest covered by the collection are history, society, art and culture. These areas are covered by showing geographical locations (towns, villages, counties and countries) as well as by showing various aspects of life in the nineteenth century. Ranging from topics such as politics, fashion in nineteenth-century France and social activities in the nineteenth-century German village to topics such as science, hiking in Switzerland, transport and coaches and trains crossing the country side.

In the mid-nineteenth-century [[wood engraving]] was used extensively for the speed and ease with which wood engravings could be produced. Engravings could be made within days of the event shown on the engraving. At this time very few (mainly American) painters could make a living selling their canvases and many turned to engraving to earn a living. Artists of the Liszt Collection’s engravings go from J. B. Allan,W. H. Bartlett and [[Thomas Bewick]] to [[Rufus Fairchild Zogbaum|R. Zogbaum]].

==The Liszt Lexicon==
The Liszt Collection offers an exceptional contribution to our world heritage. 
To open the content, consisting of images with captions and keywords and related articles, the collection will be made available on a [[wiki]] platform. In this Liszt [[Lexicon]], people all over the world will be able to participate in editing and enriching the content of the Liszt Collection. This enriched content will be available, free of charge, for educational use.

==The Liszt Press==
The Liszt Collection houses an abundance of information in images and text about the nineteenth century. The information will be made available in books through the Liszt Press. The imprint will have a large list of books, focused and specialized.  Examples from the publishing list are; The Germans in Africa in 1884; Henry Landsdell, A Journey through [[Central Asia]], around 1880; British advertisements from 1884; Major Cavagnari and the rebellion in Cabul, Afghanistan 1879; The restoration of [[Ely Cathedral]] in 1856; The [[Valparaíso]] and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] Railway in 1856; General Sir Colin Campbell, 1856; [[East Lancashire Railway]], 1848; The French Republic’s Presidential Election in 1848; The Crimea in 1855, Bagtcheserai, The valley of Baidar and [[Woronzow]] Road; Visit of English Ships in 1855 to [[Japan]], Comprising The Sybille, Hornet and Bittern.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Gizella-portrait.gif|thumb|A portrait of Gizella Schwarz in 1957 by Szikra János]] --&gt;[[File:Birth certificateweb.jpg|thumb|The birth certificate that saved Gizella Schwarz from the concentration camps¹]]
The Liszt collection’s roots lay in the [[Austria Hungary]] Empire where Gizella Schwarz (1877–1962), started to collect some ‘Liszt’ prints. These were portraits of Franz Liszt and woodcuts of the places where he lived and worked. However, her interest quickly broadened and Gizella bought prints of a great variety of subjects. Amongst many others these include butterflies and flowers, engravings of Budapest and Hungary, but also London, Paris and New York. 

On 15 October 1877, Károly Schwarz and Maria Habetler got a daughter, which they named Gizella. The baby was born in [[Körmend]], Hungary, where Gizella spent her childhood. Károly Schwarz owned the well known Schwarz Coffee House and here it was that the young Gizella met many interesting people. Körmend being a frequented stop for travellers on their way from [[Hungary]] to [[Austria]].

Gizella loved music and literature and spent her whole life reading. As family history has it, around 1880 in [[Budapest]] she even, as a little girl, met [[Franz Liszt]], the famous nineteenth-century composer. 

In 1939 she asked her birth certificate¹ from the Catholic Church in Körmend and by obtaining this certificate she saved herself from the concentration camps. The birth certificate is shown on the right and proves the validity of her origins being Roman Catholic. It is signed by the Vicar of Körmend which verifies the genuinity of the information. This is proven by his signature and stamp under the sentence: "That the certificate is in compliance with the original birth register of the Roman Catholic Church, and that I further strengthen this proof with my signature and official stamp." As it can be seen a red satisfactory tick has later been added, presumably by a German officer, to certify that her origins were indeed 'lawful'.

In 1957, Gizella was portrayed by Janos Szikra², at the age of 80, 4 years before her death.

Over the past hundred years the Liszt collection was gradually expanded and now houses over one million nineteenth-century engravings, prints and images and over two million articles.

==The Liszt Collection and image libraries==
For The Liszt Collection, a diversity of image libraries like, [[FotoLibra]], [[Alamy]], Album Archivo Fotográfico &lt;http://www.album-online.com/&gt;, Cultural Heritage Online/museum-images.com, Heritage Image Partnership Picture Library, TopFoto &lt; http://www.topfoto.co.uk/&gt; etc. offer a way of getting its collection online. The Liszt Collection is becoming a source of world heritage by the publication of the assets (image and text) as identifiable electronic publications, registered with a [[Digital object identifier|DOI]] (Digital Object Identifier) for permanent referencing and linking. One of the Liszt Collection's main aims is to be an eye-opener, showing a variety of cultures and regions, which will be now achieved through cooperating with the picture libraries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5117">{{about|the YouTube video|the South Indian actor|Silambarasan Rajendar}}
'''Little Superstar''' is a video uploaded on [[YouTube]], which is a clip from the 1990 Indian film ''[[Adhisaya Piravi]]'', starring [[Rajinikanth]]. The clip features the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] actor [[King Kong (actor)|King Kong]] (not to be confused with Thavakalai, and  another Indian little person actor, E. Shankar also known as King Kong) [[breakdance|breakdancing]] to [[MC Miker G &amp; DJ Sven]]'s "[[Holiday Rap]]". Various [[mashup (video)|mashup]]s have also appeared on the Internet using tracks from [[Cypress Hill]], [[Michael Jackson]] and others, including Ted's Fear Factory video. The first site to feature Little Superstar and give the clip its name was Dorks.com.

The video has been featured on [[YouTube]], in [[Tom Anderson (MySpace)|Tom Anderson's]] bulletins on [[Myspace]], on the [[E!]] TV show [[The Soup]], the [[MSNBC]] shows Countdown with [[Keith Olbermann]] and  [[Tucker Carlson]], G4TV's [[Attack of the Show!]] and elsewhere, as well as having been parodied on [[Saturday Night Live]]. Another popular video clip features King Kong (not E. Shankar),(actor) King Kong slapping a man from the same movie.

In recent years, actor [[King Kong (actor)|King Kong]] E. Shankar has choreographed a dance number in a ''[[Doritos]] Tandoori Sizzler!'' commercial shown in [[Canada]], which was filmed in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7py1aRJH3eE YouTube - tandoori sizzler dancer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcript of the video==

===Dancing clip===
''Mother:'' Hey, hey. What's with the party early morning? Get out everybody, shoo, shoo. [''Speaking to [[Rajinikanth]], who's lying on the cot''] Why not take some rest, dear?

''Rajinikanth:'' OK Mom [''lights up a [[beedi]] as she walks away''].

''[[King Kong (actor)|King Kong]]:'' Dude, give me a [[beedi]].

''Rajinikanth:'' Hey! Kids shouldn't smoke.

''King Kong:'' Buddy, I'm ten years older than you. Give it to me I say.

''Rajinikanth:'' And if I don't?

''King Kong:'' I'll skin you alive.

''Rajinikanth:'' Here you go. 

===Slapping clip===
''King Kong:'' Brother, you don't worry about this silly duel. I'll take care of this myself (with my hands).

''Rajinikanth:'' Ok.

(King Kong slaps thug)

''King Kong:'' [''pauses and looks at Rajinikanth''] Dude, how (am I doing)?

''Rajinikanth:'' Great!

''Rajinikanth:'' Enough. He's going to die!

[''King Kong returns to cot'']

''Rajinikanth:'' Well, is this enough or do you want a piece of me too?

==Misconceptions==
The clips were incorrectly reported as being from [[Bollywood]], which predominantly refers to the filmmaking industry of [[Hindi language|Hindi]] films, in some places on the web and TV media, such as YouTube, Yahoo and the "Oddball Plays of the Month" segment of Keith Olbermann show on MSNBC. The film is actually from [[Tamil cinema]], colloquially known as ''Kollywood'', the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] filmmaking industry based in [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]], India.

[[King Kong (actor)|King Kong]] has been incorrectly described as a [[child actor]] in some places. He is actually an adult with [[dwarfism]]. He was also never known as a "little superstar" in the Tamil film industry and is only the title of the clip given by its uploaders.

==In popular culture==
A parody version of "Little Superstar" starring porn star [[Ron Jeremy]] first started turning up on [[video sharing]] websites in March 2007. Another parody starring [[Fred Armisen]] as King Kong and [[Bill Hader]] as Rajinikanth aired on [[Saturday Night Live]] on April 21, 2007. [[Nobody's Watching]] also created a parody of the video. A parody of "Little Superstar" appeared in the season finale [[Gorillas in the Mist (American Dad!)]] of the sixth season of ''[[American Dad!]]''. It was also cited by [[Bobby Moynihan]] as a source of inspiration for SNL's "Haunted Elevator" sketch, which aired in late 2016 and featured noted character [[David S. Pumpkins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=Jesse David|title=An Oral History of ‘David Pumpkins’|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/10/david-s-pumpkins-oral-history.html|website=Vulture|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucia Anna Joyce''' (26 July 1907, [[Trieste]] – 12 December 1982, [[Northampton]]) was a professional dancer and the daughter of Irish writer [[James Joyce]] and [[Nora Barnacle]]. Once treated by Swiss psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]], Joyce was diagnosed as schizophrenic in the mid 1930s and institutionalized at the [[Burghölzli]] psychiatric clinic in [[Zurich]]. In 1951, Joyce was transferred to [[St Andrew's Hospital]] in Northampton, where she remained until her death in 1982.

==Early life and career==
Lucia Anna Joyce was born in the Ospedale Civico di Trieste on 26 July 1907. She was the second child of Irish writer [[James Joyce]] and his partner (later wife) [[Nora Barnacle]], after her brother Giorgio. Her parents being expatriates living in [[Trieste]], Lucia's first language was Italian. In her younger years, she trained as a dancer at the Dalcroze Institute in Paris. Joyce studied dancing from 1925 to 1929, training first with Jacques Dalcroze, followed by [[Margaret Morris (dancer)|Margaret Morris]] (granddaughter of [[William Morris]]), and later with [[Raymond Duncan]] (brother of [[Isadora Duncan]]) at his school near Salzburg.[2] In 1927, she danced a short duet as a toy soldier in [[Jean Renoir]]’s film adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's "La Petite marchande d’allumettes" (The Little Match Girl). She furthered her studies under Lois Hutton, Hélène Vanel, and Jean Borlin, lead dancer of the Ballet suédois.&lt;ref&gt;Shloss, Carol (2003). ''Lucia Joyce: To Dance in the Wake'', New York: Farrar, Straus and Girous, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, she joined "Les Six de rythme et couleur," a commune of six female dancers that were soon performing at venues in France, Austria, and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Le Bihan, Adrien (2011). ''James Joyce travesti par trois clercs parisiens'', Paris: Cherche Bruit, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; After a performance in La Princesse Primitive at the Vieux-Colombier theatre,  the ''Paris Times'' wrote of her,  "Lucia Joyce is her father’s daughter. She has James Joyce’s enthusiasm, energy, and a not-yet-determined amount of his genius. When she reaches her full capacity for rhythmic dancing, James Joyce may yet be known as his daughter’s father."[5] &lt;ref&gt;Shloss, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May 1929, she was chosen as one of six finalists in the first international festival of dance in Paris held at the [[Bal Bullier]]. Although she did not win, the audience, which included her father and the young [[Samuel Beckett]], championed her performance as outstanding and loudly protested the jury’s verdict.&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson, James (1996). ''Damned to Fame: the Life of Samuel Beckett'', London: Bloomsbury, 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt; Her relationship with [[Samuel Beckett]] was one of unrequited affection. Allegedly, when Lucia was 21, she and Beckett, who was her father's secretary for a short time, became lovers. Their relationship lasted only a short while and ended after Beckett, who was involved with another woman at the time, admitted he was solely interested in having a professional relationship with James Joyce.&lt;ref&gt;Shloss, 127&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 22, Joyce, after years of rigorous dedication and long hours of practice, decided "she was not physically strong enough to be a dancer of any kind".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/12/08/a-fire-in-the-brain A Fire in the Brain]: The difficulties of being James Joyce’s daughter&lt;/ref&gt; Announcing she would become a teacher, she then "turned down an offer to join a group in [[Darmstadt]] and effectively gave up dancing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://arlindo-correia.com/lucia_joyce.html Brenda Maddox, ''A Mania for Insects''], review of Carol Shloss’s biography, ''Lucia Joyce, To Dance in the Wake''&lt;/ref&gt;

Her biographer Carol Shloss, however, argues that it was her father who finally put an end to her dancing career. James reasoned that the intense physical training for ballet caused her undue stress which in turn exacerbated the long-standing animosity between her and her mother Nora. The resulting incessant domestic squabbles prevented work on ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''. James convinced her she should turn to drawing [[Initial|lettrines]] to illustrate his prose and forgo her deep-seated artistic inclinations.&lt;ref&gt;Shloss's argument summarized in Le Bihan, 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; To his patron [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]], James Joyce wrote that this resulted in "a month of tears as she thinks she has thrown away three or four years of hard work and is sacrificing a talent".&lt;ref&gt;[http://arlindo-correia.com/lucia_joyce.html Brenda Maddox, ''A Mania for Insects'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mental illness and later life ==
Joyce started to show signs of [[mental illness]] in 1930, a year after she began casually dating the 23-year-old [[Samuel Beckett]], then a junior lecturer in English at the [[Ecole normale supérieure]] in Paris. In May 1930, while her parents were in Zurich, she invited Beckett to dinner, hoping "to press him into some kind of declaration."&lt;ref&gt;Bowker, 400.&lt;/ref&gt; He flatly rejected her, explaining that he was only interested in her father and his writing. In his biography of James Joyce, Gordon Bowker argues that the underlying reasons for the rejection were Beckett's keen awareness of the "strong unfulfilled erotic bond between Lucia and her father" and her need to find "a genius father-substitute", together with "her predilection for unprotected sex."&lt;ref&gt;Bowker, 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1934, she had participated in several failed affairs, with her drawing teacher [[Alexander Calder]], another expatriate artist Albert Hubbell, and Myrsine Moschos, assistant to [[Sylvia Beach]] of [[Shakespeare and Company (bookstore)|Shakespeare and Company]]. As the year wore on, her condition had deteriorated to the point that James had [[Carl Gustav Jung]] take her in as a patient. Soon after, she was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]] at the [[Burghölzli]] psychiatric clinic in [[Zurich]]. In 1936, James consented to have his daughter undergo blood tests at [[St Andrew's Hospital]] in Northampton. After a short stay, Lucia Joyce insisted she return to Paris, the doctors explaining to her father that she could not be prevented from doing so unless he had her committed. James told his closest friends that "he would never agree to his daughter being incarcerated among the English."&lt;ref&gt;Bowker, 482.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucia Joyce returned to stay with [[Maria Jolas]], the wife of ''[[transition (literary journal)|transition]]'' editor [[Eugene Jolas]], in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]]. After three weeks, her condition worsened and she was taken away in a [[straitjacket]] to the Maison de Santé Velpeau in [[Vésinet]]. Considered a danger to both staff and inmates, she was left in isolation. Two months later, she entered the ''maison de santé'' of François Achille Delmas at [[Ivry-sur-Seine]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowker, 482.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Joyce was again transferred to St Andrew's Hospital. Over the years, she received visits from Beckett, [[Sylvia Beach]], [[Frank Budgen]], Maria Jolas, and Harriet Shaw Weaver who acted as her guardian. In 1962, Beckett donated his share of the royalties from his 1929 contributory essay on ''Finnegans Wake'' in ''[[Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress]]'' to help pay for her confinement at St Andrew's.&lt;ref&gt;Bair, Deirdre (1980). ''Samuel Beckett: A Biography'', London: Picador, 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Joyce suffered a stroke and died on 12 December of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beja|first1=Morris|title=James Joyce: A Literary Life|date=1992|publisher=Ohio State University Press|location=Columbus, Ohio|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried in [[Kingsthorpe]] Cemetery.

== Legacy ==
Her mental state, and documentation related to it, is the subject of a 2003 study by Carol Shloss who believes Lucia Joyce to have been her father's [[muse]] for ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''. Making heavy reference to the letters between Joyce and her father, the study became the subject of a [[copyright misuse]] suit by the James Joyce estate. On 25 March 2007, this litigation was resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6493095.stm Joyce letters court case settled]. B.B.C., 2007-03-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://swap.stanford.edu/20080725075557/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=18335 Scholar, James Joyce estate settle copyright dispute]. First Amendment Center/Associated Press, 2007-03-27.{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Joyce's life was the subject of ''Calico'', a West End play written by [[Michael Hastings (playwright)|Michael Hastings]], and of the 2012 graphic novel ''[[Dotter of Her Father's Eyes]]'' by Bryan and Mary M. Talbot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rachel |last=Cooke |title=Dotter of Her Father's Eyes by Mary M Talbot and Bryan Talbot – review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/27/dotter-fathers-eyes-talbot-james-joyce |work=The Guardian |date=27 January 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another play exploring her life titled ''L'' was performed to a limited audience in Concord Academy from April 14–16, 2016. It was written and directed by Sophia Ginzburg.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.concordacademy.org/news/detail/index.aspx?LinkId=5507&amp;ModuleId=280,485{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, she was the subject of a biographical novel, ''The Joyce Girl'' by [[Annabel Abbs]], which was published in the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand and translated into German, Spanish and Turkish. She is the protagonist of the "Round the Bend" chapter of [[Alan Moore]]'s 2016 novel ''Jerusalem''; set at the Northampton clinic where she spent her final years, the chapter is written in the style of her father's ''Finnegans Wake''.

{{Main|Tulsa, Oklahoma}}
'''[[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]]''' is the second-largest city in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Oklahoma]]. It has many diverse neighborhoods due to its size.

[[Downtown Tulsa]] is an area of approximately {{convert|1.4|sqmi|km2}} surrounded by an inner-dispersal loop created by Interstate 244, Highway 64, and Highway 75. The area serves as Tulsa's financial and business district, and is the focus of a large initiative to draw tourism, which includes plans to capitalize on the area's historic architecture. Much of Tulsa's convention space is located in downtown, such as the [[Tulsa Performing Arts Center]], the [[Tulsa Convention Center]], and the [[BOK Center]]. Prominent downtown sub-districts include the Blue Dome District, the Brady Arts District, the "Oil Capital Historic District", the Greenwood Historical District, [[Owen Park]] Historical Neighborhood, and the site of [[ONEOK Field]], a baseball stadium for the [[Tulsa Drillers]] opened in 2010.

The city's historical residential core lies in an area known as Midtown, containing upscale neighborhoods built in the early 20th century with architecture ranging from art deco to [[Greek Revival]]. The University of Tulsa, the [[Swan Lake (Tulsa)|Swan Lake]] neighborhood, [[Philbrook Museum]], and the upscale shopping districts of [[Utica Square]], Cherry Street, and Brookside are located in this region. A large portion of the city's southern half has developed since the 1970s, containing low density housing and retail developments. This region, marked by secluded homes and suburban neighborhoods, contains one of the state's largest shopping malls, [[Woodland Hills Mall]], as well as [[Southern Hills Country Club]], and Oral Roberts University.

East of Highway 169 and north of 61st street, a diverse racial makeup marks the eastern portions of the city, with large [[Asian people|Asian]] and [[Mexican people|Mexican]] communities and much of the city's manufacturing industry.

Areas of Tulsa west of the Arkansas River are called [[West Tulsa]], and are marked by large parks, wilderness reserves, and large oil refineries. The northern tier of the city is home to [[OSU-Tulsa]], [[Gilcrease Museum]], [[Tulsa International Airport]], the [[Tulsa Zoo]], the [[Tulsa Air and Space Museum]], and the nation's third-largest municipal park, Mohawk Park.

==Downtown==
{{Main|Downtown Tulsa}}
[[Image:Downtown Tulsa OK.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown Tulsa]]
Tulsa includes many structures built during the Oil Boom in the 1920s and 1930s, including [[Art Deco]] buildings such as [[Boston Avenue Methodist Church]] and [[Union Depot (Tulsa, Oklahoma)|Tulsa Union Depot]]. [[Waite Phillips]] left a significant architectural impact on downtown Tulsa through the [[Philtower Building|Philtower]] and [[Philcade Building]].  Other notable downtown Tulsa buildings include the Exchange Bank Building (today known as the [[320 South Boston Building]], the Cosden Building (later expanded into today's [[Mid-Continent Tower]]),  [[Atlas Life Building]], [[Holy Family Cathedral in Tulsa|Holy Family Cathedral]], Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church, and the [[Mayo Hotel]].

The core downtown area was designated on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the [[Oil Capital Historic District (Tulsa, Oklahoma)|Oil Capital Historic District]] in 2010.
[[Image:BostonAvenueMethodist.jpg|thumb|left|Boston Avenue Methodist Church]]

Downtown Tulsa is in the northwest quadrant of the city and is ringed by an expressway called the [[Interstate 444|Inner Dispersal Loop]]. Downtown's buildings include many large office towers. At {{convert|667|ft|m|abbr=on}}, the [[BOK Tower]] (formerly One Williams Center) was the tallest building in any of the 5 "plains states" ([[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]] and [[South Dakota]]) until the [[Devon Tower]] in Oklahoma City was completed in 2012. The BOK Tower was designed in 1975 by [[Minoru Yamasaki]] &amp; Associates, the same architect who designed the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]].

The [[Tulsa Performing Arts Center]] occupies a half city block in Tulsa's historical downtown. The PAC is also the design of [[Minoru Yamasaki]]. It houses five theatres and a reception hall. More than a quarter of a million people visit the Center each year to attend a performance from one of Tulsa's seven acclaimed musical and dramatic companies including the [[Tulsa Ballet]], [[Tulsa Symphony Orchestra]], [[Tulsa Opera]], [[Theatre Tulsa]], and a variety of symphonic groups. The PAC hosts a multitude of cultural events through the fall, winter and spring.

In 2005 the City of Tulsa broke ground on a 19,199 seat regional events center designed by [[architect]] [[César Pelli]]. The arena was named the [[BOK Center]] (or [[Bank of Oklahoma Center]]) and opened on August 30, 2008.

===Buena Vista Park Historic District===
{{Main|Buena Vista Park Historic District}}
The Buena Vista Park residential addition, consisting of three blocks,  was begun in 1908. It was the start of what is now Buena Vista Park Historic District, which was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 2007. The district now covers {{convert|5|acres|ha}}. Its period of architectural significance was 1913 - 1933. One of the supporting properties, the [[James Alexander Veasey House]] at 1802 South Cheyenne Avenue West, was added to the NRHP in its own right on July 27, 1989.

===The Pearl District===
The Pearl District is emerging as a cultural hub just east of downtown. Once suffering from significant blight, The Pearl District has seen fervent restoration and new business development thanks to a concerted infill effort on the part of the City of Tulsa,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cityoftulsa.org/COTlegacy/documents/3ExecutiveSummary.pdf Reinventing the Pearl District.

==Midtown==
Midtown is a largely residential district in the heart of the city. This area consists mostly of homes built from the early 1900s to the 1950s and has a wide variety of American styles ranging from the [[American Craftsman|Craftsman bungalow]] to the [[ranch-style house|ranch-style home]] to [[Greek Revival]]. The neighborhood is even home to a relocated saltbox home from colonial New England. Schools in this part of the city include [[Bishop Kelley High School|Bishop Kelley]], [[Edison Preparatory School]], Eliot Elementary, Francis Scott Key Elementary, Monte Cassino, Robert E. Lee Elementary, Patrick Henry Elementary, Wright Elementary and Undercroft Montessori.

[[File:HouseofNight4.jpg|left|thumb|A courtyard in Utica Square]]

Some of the other major shopping centers in this part of the city include the Promenade Mall, Highland Park Shopping Center, Southroads, Ranch Acres, The Farm Shopping Center, and The Plaza. [[University of Oklahoma|OU]]-[http://www.tulsa.ouhsc.edu/ Tulsa] is across the street from the Promenade Mall at 41st and Yale, on the southern edge of Midtown.

In northeast Midtown, the Tulsa State Fairgrounds, now called [[Expo Square]], is home to several Tulsa landmarks. In addition to the site being the former home to the [[minor league baseball]] [[Tulsa Drillers]], the [[Art Deco]] [[Expo Square Pavilion]], the Fair Meadows horse racing track, and the annual Tulsa State Fair, it boasts the Quick Trip Expo Center, the largest clearspan building in the world, providing 354,000 square feet (33,000 m²) of column-free space under a cable-suspended roof. In front of the Expo Center is the [[Golden Driller]], standing 76 feet (23 m) tall. Built in 1966 as a symbol for the International Petroleum Expo, the statue serves as a reminder of Tulsa's oily past.

The Expo Center is also home to the annual Darryl Starbird Rod and Custom Show. Held in early February, it is touted as 'The World's Largest Indoor Car Show' and often draws around 1,500 custom and classic cars, trucks, and motorcycles. Antique car auctions are also held here and draw many visitors from across the nation.

===Arkansas River Parks===
The Tulsa area boasts nearly {{convert|40|mi|km}} of [[river]] shoreline along the [[Arkansas River]]. River Parks lines more than {{convert|20|mi|km}} of that stretch, spread along both banks of the 1/4 mile wide channel and connected by a [http://cdm15020.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16063coll1/id/1702 pedestrian bridge] between 21st and 31st streets.

===Cherry Street===
[[Image:SwanLake.jpg|thumb|right|Swan Lake]]
The Cherry Street District is set near downtown in the northern midtown area, defined by a portion of 15th Street dubbed "Cherry Street." 15th Street has been a major east-west thoroughfare in Tulsa since This street was named Cherry Street prior to the early 1900s, when a city ordinance mandated a numerical street name. The eastern and western boundaries of the present-day district are rather vaguely defined in common usage. A 1992 article in the ''Tulsa World'' stated that the district extends from Peoria Avenue on the west to Utica Avenue on the east.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guides.tulsalibrary.org/content.php?pid=210234&amp;sid=2702864#9396387 "What is the history of Cherry Street?"] Tulsa City-County Library.

==="Black Wall Street:" The Greenwood Historical District===
{{Main|Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma}}

The [[Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma|Greenwood Historical District]] is just north of downtown and east of the Brady District. It was once one of the most affluent African-American communities in the United States and referred to as Black Wall Street.  In 1921, thirty-five blocks of businesses and residences were burned in this district during the infamous [[Tulsa Race Riot]], the bloodiest racial riot in the history of the United States. The [[Oklahoma Legislature]] passed laws in 2001 aimed at revitalizing Greenwood, setting up a [[scholarship]] fund for college-bound descendants of riot victims and appropriating $2 million for a riot memorial. As of 2004, two blocks of the old neighborhood have been restored and are part of the Greenwood Historical District.

[[Image:Cains Ballroom Tulsa Night.jpg|thumb|right|Cain's Ballroom]]

The [[Brady Theater]], built between 1912 and 1914, was originally designed to serve as the city's municipal auditorium and was simply called "Convention Hall" for the first forty years of its life and was one of three internment camps where African Americans were detained after the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot.  In 1952, major additions were added and the building was renamed Tulsa Municipal Theater.  The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.  Supplanted as the city auditorium in 1979 by construction of the Performing Arts Center in downtown, "the Old Lady on Brady" continues to be used today for a wide variety of concerts and theatrical productions.

North of the Brady on Main Street is the [[Cain's Ballroom]], formerly the garage of the Brady family&lt;ref&gt;''This Land'', "The Nightmare of Dreamland."

The district is also the location of many local artists' galleries, restaurants with late night hours, bars and dance clubs. It is also an emerging gay neighborhood, with several gay or gay-friendly bars and numerous supportive shops and restaurants.

Today, The Brady Arts District is one of the most diverse areas in all of Tulsa. It hosts restaurants, clubs, museums, and businesses and is a prime example of urban living. There is presently construction which will more than double the number of permanent residents in this artistic enclave. The neighborhood's renaissance got a significant boost in late 2012 with the opening of Guthrie Green, a public garden and outdoor stage, on a central plot of land formerly inhabited by commercial buildings. Guthrie Green has quickly emerged as a neighborhood focal point, hosting community events, live music and a farmers market.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tulsaworld.com/article.aspx/Guthrie_Green_opens_with_a_weekend_of_entertainment/20120908_11_a15_cutlin472304&lt;/ref&gt;

The district and the street were originally named for [[W. Tate Brady]], an early Tulsa business owner and active civic promoter. However, Tate Brady's involvement as a leader in the Tulsa [[Ku Klux Klan]] in the 1920s led to residents expressing their wish that the name be changed, and on August 15, 2013, the City Council voted to retain the street name, but instead officially honor [[American Civil War|Civil War]] photographer [[Mathew Brady]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kjrh.com/dpp/news/local_news/tulsa-city-council-expected-to-continue-debate-over-brady-street-name-change-at-thursdays-meeting&lt;/ref&gt; Street signs have since been changed to reflect the official street name as "M.B.

There is also a large portion of [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] on Tulsa's east side. Areas that fall in Union and Broken Arrow School districts are increasingly attracting high-income professionals looking for suburban life within the city limits. Mayo Demonstration Academy, a magnet school of the Tulsa Public School system, is located in this area. Eastgate Metroplex and East Central High School are also in this area. Also the area is home to Tulsa's Eastern hospitality district, where many hotels are located.

East Tulsa is also home to growing [[Mexican-American]] and [[Vietnamese-American]] populations (the latter centered around St. Joseph Vietnamese Catholic Church).

Redbud Valley Nature Preserve is also located in this part of the city.

[[West Tulsa, Oklahoma|West Tulsa]] is another reminder of Tulsa’s oil-rich past. Two oil refineries remain in operation to this day on the west bank of the river. This large industrial area gives way to wooded and hilly neighborhoods. The classic art deco [[Webster High School (Tulsa, Oklahoma)|Webster High School]] is here, as is the popular train-themed Ollie’s Station Restaurant, sitting next to the Tulsa rail yard. Other schools in West Tulsa include Berryhill High School, Remington Elementary, Robertson Elementary, Park Elementary and Clinton Middle School.

Parry 1887) Chapter 90:48 as being a collaborative record written by Moses, Joshua and the children of Israel.
* The [[Chronicles of the Kings of Israel]] and [[Chronicles of the Kings of Judah]] are mentioned in the [[Books of Kings]] ({{bibleref|1 Kings|14:19,29}}). They are said to tell of events during the reigns of Kings [[Jeroboam]] of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Rehoboam]] of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], respectively. The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel is again mentioned in {{bibleref|1 Kings|16:20}} regarding King [[Zimri (king)|Zimri]], and many other times throughout 1 and 2 Kings.

({{bibleref|2 Chronicles|9:29}}, {{bibleref|2 Chronicles|12:15}}, {{bibleref|2 Chronicles|13:22}}). Iddo was a seer who lived during the reigns of Solomon, Rehoboam, and Abijah. His deeds were recorded in this book, which has been completely lost to history, save for its title. The prophet Zechariah was "the son of Iddo", but this was likely not the same [[Iddo (prophet)|Iddo]]. ({{bibleref|Ezra|5:1}}, {{bibleref|Zechariah|1:1}})

"Nazorian" is typically rendered as "Nazarene" ("from Nazareth"), as in Acts 24:5, where Christians are referred to as "the sect of the Nazorians/Nazarenes" ("τῶν Ναζωραίων αἱρέσεως").

*An unknown messianic prophecy, possibly from a non-canonical source, quoted in Mark 9:12, speculated to be a vague allusion to Isaiah 53: "and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought."

The '''Paper Project''' is a fusion project that blends art, science, and technology into engaging 2D and 3D experiences.

==About the project==

The Paper Project is a multidimensional art and science project exploring the microscopic structure of paper using a [[Confocal laser scanning microscopy|scanning-laser confocal microscope]]. Created by artist and scientist Charles Kazilek and printer and paper maker Gene Valentine in 1999 the project has been exhibiting works in various formats including 2D and virtual 3D images. The 3D [[anaglyphic]] images make use of inexpensive red-blue [[Anaglyph 3D|3D glasses]] first introduced to movie goers in the 1950s. When wearing 3D glasses, it is as if the viewer has been reduced to the size of a period at the end of a sentence and is able to explore the invisible structure and beauty of paper.

In 2002, the project expanded to dance, collaborating with costume designers Jacqueline Benard and Galina Mihaleva and dance choreographer Jennifer Tsukayama.  The result of the collaboration was ''Paper Interiors: a dance exploration of real and virtual dimensions'' that debuted at the American College Dance Festival. In 2004, Jennifer Tsukayama became a member of the Paper Project and the group created a traveling 3D immersive room based on the earlier dance performance. The first installation of the room was at the Arizona Museum for Youth.

Since its creation, images from the Paper Project have been viewed around the world in museums, science centers, and on the Web. In addition to exhibits the Paper Project has developed educational content that can be used to engage students in art, history, biology, chemistry, and physics.

|title=Paper Interiors
|accessdate=18 January 2009
|publisher=Paper Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; held in the Special Collections Gallery of the J. Willard Marriott Library at the University of Utah.

*A dance component was added to the Project in 2002. The 3D immersive work was a collaboration with two costume designers, Jacqueline Benard and Galina Mihaleva and dance choreographer Jennifer Tsukayama. ''Paper Interiors: a dance exploration of real and virtual dimensions''&lt;ref name="rc7"&gt;{{cite web

The '''Public Domain Enhancement Act''' ('''PDEA''') ({{USBill|108|H.R.|2601}} (108th Congress), {{USBill|109|H.R.|2408}} (109th Congress)) was a bill in the [[United States Congress]] which, if passed, would have added a [[tax]] for [[copyright]]ed works to retain their copyright status.  The purpose of the bill was to make it easier to determine who holds a copyright (by determining the identity of the person who paid the tax), and to allow copyrighted works which have been abandoned by their owners, also known as [[orphan works]], to pass into the [[public domain]].

==Impact==
In the bill's latest form, the tax would have been a multiple-time affair, a sum of US$1 per work charged 50 years after the date of first publication or on December 31, 2006, whichever occurs later, and every 10 years thereafter until the end of the [[copyright term]], only on works first published within the United States (as charging it from foreigners would violate the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne convention]] except in some interpretations of the [[Berne three-step test]]). Failure to pay the [[United States Copyright Office|Copyright Office]] the copyright renewal fee on or before the date the fee is due or within a grace period of 6 months thereafter would allow the work to irreversibly lapse into the public domain in the United States and other countries and areas applying the [[rule of the shorter term]] of the Berne Convention. However, if payments are made in time, the copyright may be extended to the end of the normal maximum term, currently 95 years for a work made for hire. In practice, this would resemble copyright renewal under the [[Copyright Act of 1909]], but the bill will create a 50-year term renewable five times for 45 years.

The problem that the law attempts to solve is that the cost of locating the owner of a work is often prohibitive. For works that are still in print, this is usually not a problem, but otherwise there is typically not a clear record of whether the original creator transferred the rights, died, or had a clear successor to its rights.  The PDEA solves this problem by requiring a small tax to maintain copyright on a work. For works that the copyright owner no longer cares about, the copyright will lapse, and so copies and derivatives can be made freely.  The Act would also require the Copyright Office to maintain an easily searchable database, so that for works that the original publisher still wishes to maintain copyright on, potential derivative creators can find out who paid the US$1 tax and negotiate with them for permission.

==Legislative history==
This bill was first introduced in the House on June 25, 2003 by representatives [[Zoe Lofgren]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[California|CA]]) and [[John T. Doolittle]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-CA) where it went to the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary|House Committee on the Judiciary]].  On September 4, 2003, it moved to the House Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property.  On May 17, 2005 it was reintroduced by Lofgren as H.R. 2408, and was once again referred to the House Judiciary Committee.

==Opposition to PDEA==

Opposition to the Public Domain Enhancement Act comes from the entertainment industry sphere, particularly the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) and its lobbyists. In his book ''Free Culture'', [[Lawrence Lessig]] lays out the reason for the MPAA opposition to the bill:

# Congress had already "firmly rejected" the concept of copyright renewal in the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], which eliminated the need for registration and renewal of copyrighted works.
# The $1 fee would harm copyright owners, particularly those with large numbers of active and potentially commercially viable works.
# The extension fee would encourage copyright restoration, a process that re-asserts copyright over a public domain work that originated outside the US and for which US copyright was not renewed.&lt;ref&gt;Public Domain Sherpa. [http://www.publicdomainsherpa.com/copyright-restoration.html Copyright restoration and foreign works: be careful].&lt;/ref&gt;
# The benefits would fail to justify the administrative costs needed to set up and fund a registration system.
# The MPAA expressed concern about the effects of a story that underlies a currently copyrighted film moving into the public domain (although this would not invalidate the copyright of the film).
# The MPAA argues that current law already allows for the creation of derivative works via licensing and release of rights.

Proponents such as Lessig have suggested that copyright holders may be motivated to oppose the PDEA by a competitive threat: a huge wave of abandoned works would spill into the public domain which could form the basis of new derived works that would compete commercially with established copyrighted works.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Lessig.

Cox|Don Cox]] (standing), Field Marshal of the [[Black Panther Party]], in the Bernsteins' 13-room penthouse on Park Avenue in Manhattan, January 14, 1970.&lt;ref name="nymag1970" /&gt; (Photo by Stephen Salmieri.)]]"'''Radical chic'''" is a term coined by journalist [[Tom Wolfe]] in his 1970 essay "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's" to describe the adoption and promotion of [[Political radicalism|radical political]] causes by [[Celebrity|celebrities]], [[socialite]]s, and [[Upper class|high society]]. The concept has been described as "an exercise in double-tracking one's public image: on the one hand, defining oneself through committed allegiance to a radical cause, but on the other, vitally, demonstrating this allegiance because it is the fashionable, ''[[:wiktionary:au courant|au courant]]'' way to be seen in moneyed, name-conscious Society."&lt;ref name=Molotov&gt;{{cite web |last=Bracewell |first=Michael |title=Molotov Cocktails |work=[[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze Magazine]] |date=November–December 2004 |url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/molotov_cocktails |accessdate=2009-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201190439/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/molotov_cocktails |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike dedicated [[Activism|activists]], [[Revolutionary|revolutionaries]], or [[Political dissent|dissenters]], those who engage in "radical chic" remain frivolous political agitators. They are [[Ideology|ideologically]] invested in their cause of choice only so far as it advances their social standing.

"[[Terrorism|Terrorist]] chic" is a modern expression with similar connotations. This derivative, however, de-emphasizes the [[Social commentary|class satire]] of Wolfe's original term, instead accentuating concerns over the [[semiotics]] of radicalism (such as the [[aestheticization of violence]]).

In languages such as [[American English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] the term has become widely used to indicate people identifying themselves as [[Socialism|socialists]] or radical leftists while conducting upper-class lifestyles.

==Origin and meaning==
The phrase "radical chic" originated in a 1970 ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' article by [[Tom Wolfe]], titled "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's",&lt;ref name="nymag1970"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/docs/07/05/070529radical_chic.pdf|title=Radical Chic: that Party at Lenny's|last=Wolfe|first=Tom|date=8 June 1970|work=New York|accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later reprinted in his books ''[[Radical Chic &amp; Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers]]'' and ''[[The Purple Decades]]''. In the essay, Wolfe used the term to satirize composer [[Leonard Bernstein]] and his friends for their absurdity in hosting a fundraising party for the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]]—an organization whose members, activities, and goals were clearly incongruous with those of Bernstein's elite circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Foote |first=Timothy |title=Fish in the Brandy Snifter |date=1970-12-21 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904627,00.html? |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfe's concept of radical chic was intended to lampoon individuals  (particularly [[Elitism|social elites]] like the [[jet set]]) who endorsed [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] radicalism merely to affect worldliness, assuage [[white guilt]], or garner prestige, rather than to affirm genuine political convictions.

{{Quote|[Wolfe's] subject is how culture's patrician classes – the wealthy, fashionable intimates of high society – have sought to luxuriate in both a vicarious glamour and a monopoly on virtue through their public espousal of street politics: a politics, moreover, of minorities so removed from their sphere of experience and so absurdly, diametrically, opposed to the islands of privilege on which the cultural aristocracy maintain their isolation, that the whole basis of their relationship is wildly out of kilter from the start. ... In short, Radical Chic is described as a form of highly developed decadence; and its greatest fear is to be seen not as prejudiced or unaware, but as middle-class.|Michael Bracewell|"Molotov Cocktails"&lt;ref name=Molotov /&gt;}}

==Background==
The concept of "fashionable" espousal of radical causes by members of wealthy society in this case had been argued against by Bernstein's wife, [[Felicia Montealegre]], prior to the publication of "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's", a fact Wolfe details in it. The essay appeared in the June 8, 1970 issue of ''New York'', 20 weeks after the actual fund raiser at the Bernstein residence was held on January 14. The first report of the event appeared the following day in a piece by ''[[The New York Times]]'' style reporter [[Charlotte Curtis]], who was in attendance. Curtis wrote in part: "Leonard Bernstein and a Black Panther leader argued the merits of the Black Panther party's philosophy before nearly 90 guests last night in the Bernsteins' elegant Park Avenue duplex." According to Wolfe, the release of the story worldwide was followed by strong criticism of the event: "The English, particularly, milked the story for all it was worth and seemed to derive one of the great cackles of the year from it."&lt;ref name=nymag1970 /&gt;

The negative reaction prompted publication of an op-ed in the ''Times'' on January 16 entitled "False Note on Black Panthers" that was severely critical of the Black Panther Party and Bernstein:

{{Quote|Emergence of the Black Panthers as the romanticized darlings of the politico-cultural jet set is an affront to the majority of black Americans. ... the group therapy plus fund-raising soiree at the home of Leonard Bernstein, as reported in this newspaper yesterday, represents the sort of elegant slumming that degrades patrons and patronized alike. It might be dismissed as guilt-relieving fun spiked with social consciousness, except for its impact on those blacks and whites seriously working for complete equality and social justice.&lt;ref name="nyt_false_note"&gt;{{cite news|title=False Note on Black Panthers|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 16, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Felicia Montealegre wrote and personally delivered a response to this op-ed to the ''Times'' offices.&lt;ref name="nymag_html"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfe|first=Tom|title=Tom Wolfe on Radical Chic and Leonard Bernstein's Party for the Black Panthers|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/46170/index15.html|work=Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's|publisher=New York|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her response she wrote:

{{Quote|As a civil libertarian, I asked a number of people to my house on Jan. 14 in order to hear the lawyer and others involved with the Panther 21 discuss the problem of civil liberties as applicable to the men now waiting trial, and to help raise funds for their legal expenses. ... It was for this deeply serious purpose that our meeting was called. The frivolous way in which it was reported as a "fashionable" event is unworthy of the Times, and offensive to all people who are committed to humanitarian principles of justice.&lt;ref name=nymag_html /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt_letter"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Felicia M.|title=Letters to the Editor of The Times: Panthers' Legal Aid|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/21/archives/letters-to-the-editor-of-the-times.html |accessdate=4 June 2018|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 21, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Terrorist chic==

'''Terrorist chic''' (also known as "terror chic" or "militant chic") is a more recent and specific variation of the term. It refers to the [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of symbols, objects, and aesthetics related to radical [[Militant (word)|militants]], usually in the context of [[Popular culture|pop culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Daly |first=Susan |title=Is the war over for terrorist chic? |work=[[Independent.ie]] |publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]] |date=2008-11-08 |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/news-gossip/is-the-war-over-for-terrorist-chic-1528669.html |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[fashion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Herr |first=Cheryl |title=Terrorist Chic and Marching Season Style |work=[[The Vacuum]] |publisher=Factotum |date=July 2004 |url=http://www.thevacuum.org.uk/issues/issues0120/issue17/is17artterchi.html |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; When such imagery is deployed [[Subversion (politics)|subversively]], the process exemplifies aestheticization of propaganda. Regardless, because terrorist chic derives its [[iconography]] from groups and individuals often associated with violent conflict or [[terrorism]], the term carries a greater pejorative tone than "radical chic."

Instances of terrorist chic have variously been interpreted as morally irresponsible, earnestly [[Counterculture|counter-cultural]], ironically [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hip]], or benignly apolitical. According to Henry K. Miller of the ''[[New Statesman]]'', the most well-known example is the ubiquitous appearance of [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara in popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Miller |first=Henry K |title=Fatal attraction |work=[[New Statesman]] |date=2002-10-28 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200210280033 |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cases that have been labeled terrorist chic include: the Prada-Meinhof fashion line (a pun on [[Prada]] and the [[Red Army Faction|Baader-Meinhof Gang]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Connolly |first=Kate |title=Astrid Proll's journey to Terror Chic |work=[[The Observer]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=2002-10-06 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/oct/06/germany.kateconnolly |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smiley |first=Shannon |title=Germany Debates 'Terrorist Chic': Art and Fashion Stir Memories of Leftist Violence in '70s |work=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]] |date=2005-02-20 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38447-2005Feb19.html |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fashion of combining [[keffiyeh]]s and military-style clothing such as camo prints and heavy boots, outside the [[Arab World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hernandez |first=Daniel |title='Terrorist Chic' and Beyond |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]] |date=2006-04-09 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/apr/09/magazine/tm-terrorchic15 |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lando |first=Michal |title=US chain pulls 'anti-war' keffiyehs |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |publisher=Mirkaei Tikshoret Ltd. |date=2007-01-19 |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1167467767600&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |accessdate=2009-04-05 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noting the sustained interest in Che, Bernstein suggested that "the end of the cold war and the failure of the third-world revolution" allowed for the "scrutiny of Guevara, [as] a symbol of both the idealism and the [[moral blindness]] of the decade of protest" to take place free in a context free "of ideological partisanship and rancor."&lt;ref name=NYT26nov1997 /&gt;

'''Renaissance architecture''' is the European architecture of the period between the early 14th and early 17th centuries in different&lt;!---leave this word---&gt; regions, demonstrating a conscious revival and development of certain elements of [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] thought and material culture. Stylistically, Renaissance architecture followed [[Gothic architecture]] and was succeeded by [[Baroque architecture]].  Developed first in [[Florence]], with [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] as one of its innovators, the Renaissance style quickly spread to other Italian cities. The style was carried to France, Germany, England, Russia and other parts of Europe at different dates and with varying degrees of impact.

Renaissance style places emphasis on [[symmetry]], [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]], [[geometry]] and the regularity of parts, as they are demonstrated in the architecture of [[classical antiquity]] and in particular ancient [[Roman architecture]], of which many examples remained. Orderly arrangements of [[column]]s, [[pilaster]]s and [[Lintel|lintels]], as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical [[dome]]s, [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] and [[aedicula]] replaced the more complex proportional systems and irregular profiles of [[Gothic architecture|medieval]] buildings.

==Historiography==
The word "Renaissance" derived from the term ''"la rinascita"'', which means rebirth, first appeared in Giorgio Vasari's ''Vite de' più eccellenti architetti, pittori, et scultori Italiani'' The Lives of the Artists, 1550–60.

Although the term Renaissance was used first by the French historian Jules Michelet, it was given its more lasting definition from the Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt, whose book, ''Die Kultur der Renaissance in Italien'' 1860, The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy, 1860, English translation, by SGC Middlemore, in 2 vols., London, 1878) was influential in the development of the modern interpretation of the Italian Renaissance. The folio of measured drawings ''Édifices de Rome moderne; ou, Recueil des palais, maisons, églises, couvents et autres monuments'' (The Buildings of Modern Rome), first published in 1840 by Paul Letarouilly, also played an important part in the revival of interest in this period.Erwin Panofsky, ''Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art'', (New York: Harper and Row, 1960) The Renaissance style was recognized by contemporaries in the term ''"all'antica"'', or "in the ancient manner" (of the Romans).

==Development in Italy – influences==
{{Main|Italian Renaissance}}
Italy of the 15th century, and the city of Florence 
in particular, was home to the Renaissance. It is in Florence that the new architectural style had its beginning, not slowly evolving in the way that [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] grew out of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], but consciously brought to being by particular architects who sought to revive the order of a past "[[Golden Age]]". The scholarly approach to the architecture of the ancient coincided with the general revival of learning. A number of factors were influential in bringing this about.

[[File:Baptisteriumganz.jpg|thumb|left|The Romanesque Baptistery of Florence was the object of Brunelleschi's studies of perspective]]

===Architectural===

Italian architects had always preferred forms that were clearly defined and structural members that expressed their purpose.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt; Many Tuscan Romanesque buildings demonstrate these characteristics, as seen in the Florence Baptistery and Pisa Cathedral.

Italy had never fully adopted the Gothic style of architecture. Apart from the [[Cathedral of Milan]], (influenced by French Rayonnant Gothic), few Italian churches show the emphasis on vertical, the clustered shafts, ornate tracery and complex ribbed vaulting that characterise Gothic in other parts of Europe.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

The presence, particularly in Rome, of ancient architectural remains showing the ordered [[Classical style]] provided an inspiration to artists at a time when philosophy was also turning towards the Classical.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

===Political===

In the 15th century, [[Florence]], [[Venice]] and [[Naples]] extended their power through much of the area that surrounded them, making the movement of artists possible. This enabled Florence to have significant artistic influence in [[Milan]], and through Milan, [[France]].

In 1377, the return of the Pope from the [[Avignon Papacy]]&lt;ref&gt;Joëlle Rollo-Koster, ''Raiding Saint Peter: Empty Sees, Violence, and the Initiation of the Great Western Schism (1378)'', (Brill, 2008), 182.&lt;/ref&gt; and the re-establishment of the [[Papal court]] in Rome, brought wealth and importance to that city, as well as a renewal in the importance of the Pope in Italy, which was further strengthened by the [[Council of Constance]] in 1417. Successive Popes, especially [[Julius II]], 1503–13, sought to extend the Pope’s [[Papal states|temporal power]] throughout Italy.&lt;ref name=A.M&gt;Andrew Martindale, ''Man and the Renaissance'', 1966, Paul Hamlyn, ISBN unknown&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial===

In the early Renaissance, [[Venice]] controlled sea trade over goods from the East. The large towns of [[Northern Italy]] were prosperous through trade with the rest of Europe, [[Genoa]] providing a seaport for the goods of France and Spain; [[Milan]] and [[Turin]] being centers of overland trade, and maintaining substantial metalworking industries.
Trade brought wool from England to Florence, ideally located on the river for the production of fine cloth, the industry on which its wealth was founded. By dominating [[Pisa]], Florence gained a seaport, and also maintained dominance of Genoa.
In this commercial climate, one family in particular turned their attention from trade to the lucrative business of money-lending. The [[House of Medici|Medici]] became the chief bankers to the princes of Europe, becoming virtually princes themselves as they did so, by reason of both wealth and influence.
Along the trade routes, and thus offered some protection by commercial interest, moved not only goods but also artists, scientists and philosophers.&lt;ref name=A.M /&gt;

[[File:Melozzo da Forlì 001.jpg|thumb|Pope Sixtus IV, 1477, builder of the Sistine Chapel. Fresco by [[Melozzo da Forlì]] in the [[Vatican Palace]].]]

===Religious===

The return of the [[Pope Gregory XI]] from [[Avignon]] in September 1377 and the resultant new emphasis on [[Rome]] as the center of [[Christianity|Christian]] spirituality, brought about a boom in the building of churches in Rome such as had not taken place for nearly a thousand years. This commenced in the mid 15th century and gained momentum in the 16th century, reaching its peak in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] period. The construction of the [[Sistine Chapel]] with its uniquely important decorations and the entire rebuilding of St Peter's, one of Christendom's most significant churches, were part of this process.&lt;ref name= I.R.&gt;Ilan Rachum, ''The Renaissance, an Illustrated Encyclopedia'', 1979, Octopus, {{ISBN|0-7064-0857-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In wealthy republican Florence, the impetus for church-building was more civic than spiritual. The unfinished state of the enormous cathedral dedicated to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] did no honour to the city under her patronage. However, as the technology and finance were found to complete it, the rising dome did credit not only to the Blessed Virgin, its architect and the Church but also the Signoria, the Guilds and the sectors of the city from which the manpower to construct it was drawn. The dome inspired further religious works in Florence.

===Philosophic===

The development of printed books, the rediscovery of ancient writings, the expanding of political and trade contacts and the exploration of the world all increased knowledge and the desire for education.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

The reading of philosophies that were not based on Christian theology led to the development of [[Humanism]] through which it was clear that while God had established and maintained order in the Universe, it was the role of Man to establish and maintain order in Society.&lt;ref&gt;J.R.Hale, ''Renaissance Europe, 1480–1520'', 1971, Fontana {{ISBN|0-00-632435-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jacopo Pontormo 055.jpg|thumb|[[Cosimo de' Medici the Elder]], head of the Medici Bank, sponsored civic building programs. Posthumous portrait by [[Pontormo]].]]

===Civil===

Through [[Humanism]], civic pride and the promotion of civil peace and order were seen as the marks of citizenship. This led to the building of structures such as Brunelleschi's [[Ospedale degli Innocenti|Hospital of the Innocents]] with its elegant colonnade forming a link between the charitable building and the public square, and the [[Laurentian Library]] where the collection of books established by the Medici family could be consulted by scholars.&lt;ref name= Gardner&gt;[[Helen Gardner (art historian)|Helen Gardner]], ''Art Through the Ages'', 5th edition, Harcourt, Brace and World.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some major ecclesiastical building works were also commissioned, not by the church, but by guilds representing the wealth and power of the city. Brunelleschi’s dome at [[Florence Cathedral]], more than any other building, belonged to the populace because the construction of each of the eight segments was achieved by a different sector of the city.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref name= Gardner /&gt;

===Patronage===

As in the [[Plato|Platonic academy]] of [[Athens]], it was seen by those of Humanist understanding that those people who had the benefit of wealth and education ought to promote the pursuit of learning and the creation of that which was beautiful. To this end, wealthy families—the [[Medici]] of Florence, the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] of Mantua, the [[House of Farnese|Farnese]] in Rome, the [[House of Sforza|Sforzas]] in Milan—gathered around them people of learning and ability, promoting the skills and creating employment for the most talented artists and architects of their day.&lt;ref name= Gardner /&gt;

===Architectural theory===
{{further|Mathematics and architecture}}

During the Renaissance, architecture became not only a question of practice, but also a matter for theoretical discussion. [[Printing]] played a large role in the dissemination of ideas.
* The first treatise on architecture was ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'' ("On the Subject of Building") by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] in 1450. It was to some degree dependent on [[Vitruvius]]'s ''[[De architectura]]'', a manuscript of which was discovered in 1414 in a library in Switzerland. ''De re aedificatoria'' in 1485 became the first printed book on architecture.
* [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475 – c. 1554) produced the next important text, the first volume of which appeared in Venice in 1537; it was entitled ''Regole generali d'architettura'' ("General Rules of Architecture"). It is known as Serlio's "Fourth Book" since it was the fourth in Serlio's original plan of a treatise in seven books. In all, five books were published.
* In 1570, [[Andrea Palladio]] (1508–1580) published ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'' ("The Four Books of Architecture") in [[Venice]]. This book was widely printed and responsible to a great degree for spreading the ideas of the Renaissance through Europe. All these books were intended to be read and studied not only by architects, but also by patrons.

==Principal phases==
[[File:PalladioBramanteTempietto1570.jpg|thumb|upright|Palladio's engraving of Bramante's Tempietto]]
[[File:Tempietto - Houtsnede door Palladio 2.jpeg|thumb|upright|Plan of Bramante's Tempietto in Montorio]]

Historians often divide the Renaissance in Italy into three phases.&lt;ref&gt;Some architectural histories e.g. Sir [[Banister Fletcher]], include Baroque as a phase of Renaissance architecture. Because of its extent, diversity and deviation from the Classical it is not included here and is the subject of a main article.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas art historians might talk of an "Early Renaissance" period, in which they include developments in 14th-century painting and sculpture, this is usually not the case in architectural history. The bleak economic conditions of the late 14th century did not produce buildings that are considered to be part of the Renaissance. As a result, the word "Renaissance" among architectural historians usually applies to the period 1400 to ca. 1525, or later in the case of non-Italian Renaissances.

Historians often use the following designations:
* Renaissance (ca. 1400–1500); also known as the [[Quattrocento]]&lt;ref&gt;The Italian translates literally to "fourteen-hundred" and coincides with the English "fifteenth century".&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes Early Renaissance&lt;ref&gt;The ''Early Renaissance'' in architecture is most applicable to developments in Venice, where there was a more fluid development between medieval and Renaissance styles than in Florence. See: John McAndrew ''Venetian Architecture of the Early Renaissance'' (Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[High Renaissance]] (ca.1500–1525)
* [[Mannerism]] (ca. 1520–1600)

===Quattrocento===

In the ''Quattrocento'', concepts of architectural order were explored and rules were formulated. (See- Characteristics of Renaissance Architecture, below.) The study of classical antiquity led in particular to the adoption of Classical detail and ornamentation.

Space, as an element of architecture, was used differently from the way it had been in the [[Middle Ages]]. Space was organised by proportional logic, its form and rhythm subject to geometry, rather than being created by intuition as in Medieval buildings. The prime example of this is the [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze|Basilica di San Lorenzo]] in [[Florence]] by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] (1377–1446).&lt;ref&gt;Howard Saalman. ''Filippo Brunelleschi: The Buildings''. (London: Zwemmer, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

===High Renaissance===

During the ''[[High Renaissance]]'', concepts derived from classical antiquity were developed and used with greater confidence. The most representative architect is [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]] (1444–1514) who expanded the applicability of classical architecture to contemporary buildings. His [[San Pietro in Montorio]] (1503) was directly inspired by circular [[Roman temple]]s. He was, however, hardly a slave to the classical forms and it was his style that was to dominate Italian architecture in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Arnaldo Bruschi. ''Bramante'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CampidoglioEng.jpg|thumb|left|The Campidoglio]]

===Mannerism===
{{main|Mannerism#Mannerist architecture}}

During the [[Mannerist]] period, architects experimented with using architectural forms to emphasize solid and spatial relationships. The Renaissance ideal of harmony gave way to freer and more imaginative rhythms. The best known architect associated with the Mannerist style was [[Michelangelo]] (1475–1564), who frequently used the [[giant order]] in his architecture, a large pilaster that stretches from the bottom to the top of a façade.&lt;ref&gt;{{verify source|date=July 2014}}{{Citation | title= Pilaster Play|author= [[Mark Jarzombek]]| journal=  Thresholds | url= http://web.mit.edu/mmj4/www/downloads/thresholds28.pdf | volume= 28 (Winter 2005)|  pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used this in his design for the [[Campidoglio]] in Rome.

Prior to the 20th century, the term ''Mannerism'' had negative connotations, but it is now used to describe the historical period in more general non-judgemental terms.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Hauser. ''Mannerism: The Crisis of the Renaissance and the Origins of Modern Art''. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

===From Renaissance to Baroque===

{{main|Baroque architecture}}
As the new style of architecture spread out from Italy, most other European countries developed a sort of Proto-Renaissance style, before the construction of fully formulated Renaissance buildings. Each country in turn then grafted its own architectural traditions to the new style, so that Renaissance buildings across Europe are diversified by region.

Within Italy the evolution of Renaissance architecture into Mannerism, with widely diverging tendencies in the work of Michelangelo and Giulio Romano and Andrea Palladio, led to the Baroque style in which the same architectural vocabulary was used for very different rhetoric.

Outside Italy, Baroque architecture was more widespread and fully developed than the Renaissance style, with significant buildings as far afield as [[Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Cathedral of Chihuahua]], 1725–1826&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Basilica Minore del Santo Niño]], present structure 1735–39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:SaintPierreRaphael.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Raphael's unused plan for St. Peter's Basilica]]
The obvious distinguishing features of Classical Roman architecture were adopted by Renaissance architects. However, the forms and purposes of buildings had changed over time, as had the structure of cities. Among the earliest buildings of the reborn Classicism were churches of a type that the Romans had never constructed. Neither were there models for the type of large city dwellings required by wealthy merchants of the 15th century. Conversely, there was no call for enormous sporting fixtures and public bath houses such as the Romans had built. The ancient orders were analysed and reconstructed to serve new purposes.&lt;ref&gt;The list of characteristics below is expanded from a list based on [[Banister Fletcher]]. See below&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plan===

The plans of Renaissance buildings have a square, symmetrical appearance in which proportions are usually based on a module. Within a church, the module is often the width of an aisle. The need to integrate the design of the plan with the façade was introduced as an issue in the work of [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], but he was never able to carry this aspect of his work into fruition. The first building to demonstrate this was [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|St. Andrea]] in Mantua by [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]]. The development of the plan in secular architecture was to take place in the 16th century and culminated with the work of [[Palladio]].
[[File:Sant agostino.JPG|thumb|Sant'Agostino, Rome, Giacomo di Pietrasanta, 1483]]

====Façade====
[[Façade]]s are symmetrical around their vertical axis. Church façades are generally surmounted by a [[pediment]] and organised by a system of [[pilaster]]s, arches and [[entablature]]s. The columns and windows show a progression towards the centre. One of the first true Renaissance façades was the [[Pienza Cathedral|Cathedral of Pienza]] (1459–62), which has been attributed to the Florentine architect Bernardo Gambarelli (known as [[Rossellino]]) with [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]] perhaps having some responsibility in its design as well.

Domestic buildings are often surmounted by a [[cornice]]. There is a regular repetition of openings on each floor, and the centrally placed door is marked by a feature such as a balcony, or rusticated surround. An early and much copied prototype was the façade for the [[Palazzo Rucellai]] (1446 and 1451) in Florence with its three registers of [[pilasters]]
[[File:Classical orders from the Encyclopedie.png|thumb|left|Classical Orders, engraving from the ''Encyclopédie vol. 18.'' 18th century.]]

===Columns and pilasters===

The Greek and Roman orders of columns are used:- [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]], [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]], [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] and [[Composite order|Composite]]. The orders can either be structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall in the form of pilasters. During the Renaissance, architects aimed to use columns, pilasters, and [[entablatures]] as an integrated system. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the [[Sagrestia Vecchia|Old Sacristy]] (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi.

===Arches===

Arches are semi-circular or (in the Mannerist style) segmental. Arches are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the springing of the arch. Alberti was one of the first to use the arch on a monumental scale at the [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|St. Andrea]] in Mantua.

===Vaults===

Vaults do not have ribs. They are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the Gothic vault which is frequently rectangular. The [[barrel vault]] is returned to architectural vocabulary as at the [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|St. Andrea]] in Mantua.

===Domes===
{{main|History of Italian Renaissance domes}}
[[File:StPetersDomePD.jpg|thumb|The Dome of St Peter's Basilica, Rome.&lt;!---this is an image that speaks for itself! The rest of the info is further down the page---&gt;]]
The dome is used frequently, both as a very large structural feature that is visible from the exterior, and also as a means of roofing smaller spaces where they are only visible internally. After the success of the dome in Brunelleschi’s design for the [[Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore]] and its use in Bramante’s plan for [[St. Peter's Basilica]] (1506) in Rome, the dome became an indispensable element in church architecture and later even for secular architecture, such as Palladio's [[Villa Rotonda]].&lt;ref&gt;A major use of this feature is great dome of the [[US Capitol Building]] (begun 1856) in [[Washington DC]] and all the subsequent State Capitals buildings in the [[Renaissance Revival]] style.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceilings===

Roofs are fitted with flat or [[coffered]] ceilings. They are not left open as in Medieval architecture. They are frequently painted or decorated.

===Doors===

Doors usually have square lintels. They may be set within an arch or surmounted by a triangular or segmental pediment.
Openings that do not have doors are usually arched and frequently have a large or decorative keystone.

===Windows===

Windows may be paired and set within a semi-circular arch. They may have square lintels and triangular or segmental pediments, which are often used alternately. Emblematic in this respect is the [[Palazzo Farnese]] in Rome, begun in 1517.
[[File:Palazzo Strozzi cortile.JPG|thumb|left|Courtyard of Palazzo Strozzi, Florence]]
In the Mannerist period the “Palladian” arch was employed, using a motif of a high semi-circular topped opening flanked with two lower square-topped openings. Windows are used to bring light into the building and in domestic architecture, to give views. Stained glass, although sometimes present, is not a feature.

===Walls===

External walls are generally constructed of brick, rendered, or faced with stone in highly finished [[ashlar]] masonry, laid in straight courses.  The corners of buildings are often emphasised by rusticated [[quoin (architecture)|quoins]]. Basements and ground floors were often rusticated, as at the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]] (1444–1460) in Florence. Internal walls are smoothly plastered and surfaced with [[lime wash]]. For more formal spaces, internal surfaces are decorated with [[fresco]]es.

===Details===

Courses, mouldings and all decorative details are carved with great precision. Studying and mastering the details of the ancient Romans was one of the important aspects of Renaissance theory. The different orders each required different sets of details. Some architects were stricter in their use of classical details than others, but there was also a good deal of innovation in solving problems, especially at corners. Mouldings stand out around doors and windows rather than being recessed, as in Gothic Architecture. Sculptured figures may be set in niches or placed on plinths. They are not integral to the building as in Medieval architecture.&lt;ref name=BF&gt;[[Banister Fletcher]], ''History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''(first published 1896, current edition 2001, Elsevier Science &amp; Technology {{ISBN|0-7506-2267-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development in Italy – Early Renaissance==
The leading architects of the Early Renaissance or Quattrocento were [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Michelozzo]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]].

===Brunelleschi===
The person generally credited with bringing about the Renaissance view of architecture is [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], (1377–1446).&lt;ref&gt;Cropplestone, Trewin, ''World Architecture'', 1963, Hamlyn. Page 243&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying feature of the work of Brunelleschi was "order".
[[File:Piazza SS Annunziata Firenze Apr 2008 (3).JPG|thumb|upright|[[Ospedale degli Innocenti]] in Florence.]]
In the early 15th century, Brunelleschi began to look at the world to see what the rules were that governed one's way of seeing. He observed that the way one sees regular structures such as the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)|Baptistery of Florence]] and the tiled pavement surrounding it follows a mathematical order—[[linear perspective]].

The buildings remaining among the ruins of ancient Rome appeared to respect a simple mathematical order in the way that Gothic buildings did not. One incontrovertible rule governed all [[Ancient Roman architecture]]—a semi-circular arch is exactly twice as wide as it is high. A fixed proportion with implications of such magnitude occurred nowhere in [[Gothic architecture]]. A Gothic pointed arch could be extended upwards or flattened to any proportion that suited the location. Arches of differing angles frequently occurred within the same structure. No set rules of proportion applied.

From the observation of the architecture of Rome came a desire for symmetry and careful proportion in which the form and composition of the building as a whole and all its subsidiary details have fixed relationships, each section in proportion to the next, and the architectural features serving to define exactly what those rules of proportion are.&lt;ref name= W&amp;M&gt;Robert Erich Wolf and Ronald Millen, ''Renaissance and Mannerist Art'', 1968, Harry N. Abrams.&lt;/ref&gt; Brunelleschi gained the support of a number of wealthy Florentine patrons, including the Silk Guild and [[Cosimo de' Medici]].

[[File:Santa Maria del Fiore cupola (1622842169).jpg|thumb|left|The dome of [[Florence Cathedral]] (the Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore)]]

====Florence Cathedral====
Brunelleschi's first major architectural commission was for the enormous brick dome which covers the central space of [[Duomo of Florence|Florence's cathedral]], designed by [[Arnolfo di Cambio]] in the 14th century but left unroofed. While often described as the first building of the Renaissance, Brunelleschi's daring design uses the pointed Gothic arch and Gothic ribs that were apparently planned by Arnolfio. It seems certain, however, that while stylistically Gothic, in keeping with the building it surmounts, the dome is in fact structurally influenced by the great dome of Ancient Rome, which Brunelleschi could hardly have ignored in seeking a solution. This is the dome of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], a circular temple, now a church.

Inside the Pantheon's single-shell concrete dome is coffering which greatly decreases the weight. The vertical partitions of the coffering effectively serve as ribs, although this feature does not dominate visually. At the apex of the Pantheon's dome is an opening, 8 meters across. Brunelleschi was aware that a dome of enormous proportion could in fact be engineered without a keystone. The dome in Florence is supported by the eight large ribs and sixteen more internal ones holding a brick shell, with the bricks arranged in a herringbone manner. Although the techniques employed are different, in practice both domes comprise a thick network of ribs supporting very much lighter and thinner infilling. And both have a large opening at the top.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

[[File:Einblick LH2 San Lorenzo Florenz.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The church of San Lorenzo]]

====San Lorenzo====
The new architectural philosophy of the Renaissance is best demonstrated in the churches of [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze|San Lorenzo]], and [[Santo Spirito di Firenze|Santo Spirito]] in Florence. Designed by Brunelleschi in about 1425 and 1428 respectively, both have the shape of the [[Latin cross]]. Each has a modular plan, each portion being a multiple of the square bay of the aisle. This same formula controlled also the vertical dimensions. In the case of Santo Spirito, which is entirely regular in plan, transepts and chancel are identical, while the nave is an extended version of these. In 1434 Brunelleschi designed the first Renaissance centrally planned building, [[Santa Maria degli Angeli di Firenze|Santa Maria degli Angeli]] of Florence. It is composed of a central [[octagon]] surrounded by a circuit of eight smaller chapels. From this date onwards numerous churches were built in variations of these designs.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Fanelli, ''Brunelleschi'', 1980, Becocci editore Firenze&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michelozzo===
[[Michelozzo Michelozzi]] (1396–1472), was another architect under patronage of the [[Medici]] family, his most famous work being the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]], which he was commissioned to design for [[Medici|Cosimo de' Medici]] in 1444. A decade later he built the Villa Medici at [[Fiesole]]. Among his other works for Cosimo are the library at the Convent of San Marco, Florence. He went into exile in Venice for a time with his patron. He was one of the first architects to work in the Renaissance style outside Italy, building a palace at [[Dubrovnik]].&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;
[[File:Palazzo medici riccardi 33 Sailko adj.JPG|thumb|left|Palazzo Medici Riccardi by Michelozzo. Florence, 1444]]
The Palazzo Medici Riccardi is Classical in the details of its pedimented windows and recessed doors, but, unlike the works of Brunelleschi and Alberti, there are no ''[[Classical orders|orders]]'' of columns in evidence. Instead, Michelozzo has respected the Florentine liking for rusticated stone. He has seemingly created three orders out of the three defined rusticated levels, the whole being surmounted by an enormous Roman-style cornice which juts out over the street by 2.5 meters.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

===Alberti===
[[Leon Battista Alberti]], born in Genoa (1402–1472), was an important Humanist theoretician and designer whose book on architecture ''De re Aedificatoria'' was to have lasting effect. An aspect of [[Humanism]] was an emphasis of the anatomy of nature, in particular the human form, a science first studied by the Ancient Greeks. Humanism made man the measure of things. Alberti perceived the architect as a person with great social responsibilities.&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;

[[File:Sant Andrea straight.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Sant'Andrea, Mantua]], the façade]]
He designed a number of buildings, but unlike Brunelleschi, he did not see himself as a builder in a practical sense and so left the supervision of the work to others. Miraculously, one of his greatest designs, that of the Church of [[Sant'Andrea in Mantua]], was brought to completion with its character essentially intact. Not so the church of [[San Francesco, Rimini|San Francesco]] in [[Rimini]], a rebuilding of a Gothic structure, which, like Sant'Andrea, was to have a façade reminiscent of a Roman triumphal arch. This was left sadly incomplete.&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;

Sant'Andrea is an extremely dynamic building both without and within. Its triumphal façade is marked by extreme contrasts. The projection of the order of pilasters that define the architectural elements, but are essentially non-functional, is very shallow. This contrasts with the gaping deeply recessed arch which makes a huge portico before the main door. The size of this arch is in direct contrast to the two low square-topped openings that frame it. The light and shade play dramatically over the surface of the building because of the shallowness of its mouldings and the depth of its porch. In the interior Alberti has dispensed with the traditional nave and aisles. Instead there is a slow and majestic progression of alternating tall arches and low square doorways, repeating the "[[Arch of Constantine|triumphal arch]]" motif of the façade.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Rykwert, ''Leonis Baptiste Alberti'', Architectural Design, Vol 49 No 5–6, Holland St, London&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Santa Maria Novella.jpg|thumb|left|Façade of [[Santa Maria Novella]], 1456–70]]
Two of Alberti’s best known buildings are in Florence, the [[Palazzo Rucellai]] and at [[Santa Maria Novella]]. For the palace, Alberti applied the classical orders of columns to the façade on the three levels, 1446–51. At Santa Maria Novella he was commissioned to finish the decoration of the façade. He completed the design in 1456 but the work was not finished until 1470.

The lower section of the building had Gothic niches and typical polychrome marble decoration. There was a large ocular window in the end of the nave which had to be taken into account. Alberti simply respected what was already in place, and the Florentine tradition for polychrome that was well established at the [[Baptistery of Florence|Baptistery of San Giovanni]], the most revered building in the city. The decoration, being mainly polychrome marble, is mostly very flat in nature, but a sort of order is established by the regular compartments and the circular motifs which repeat the shape of the round window.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt; For the first time, Alberti linked the lower roofs of the aisles to nave using two large scrolls. These were to become a standard Renaissance device for solving the problem of different roof heights and bridge the space between horizontal and vertical surfaces.&lt;ref name= Pevs&gt;[[Nikolaus Pevsner]], ''An Outline of European Architecture'', Pelican, 1964, ISBN unknown&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread of the Renaissance in Italy==
[[File:748CertosaPaviaChiesa.JPG|thumb|The Church of the [[Certosa di Pavia]],  Lombardy]]
In the 15th century the courts of certain other Italian states became centres for spreading of Renaissance philosophy, art and architecture.

In [[Mantua]] at the court of the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]], Alberti designed two churches, the [[Sant'Andrea, Mantua|Basilica of Sant'Andrea]] and [[San Sebastiano (Mantua)|San Sebastiano]].

[[Urbino]] was an important centre with the ancient [[Palazzo Ducale, Urbino|ducal palace]] being extended for [[Federico da Montefeltro]] in the mid 15th century. The duke employed [[Luciano Laurana]] from [[Dalmatia]], renowned for his expertise at fortification. The design incorporates much of the earlier medieval building and includes an unusual turreted three-storeyed façade. Laurana was assisted by Francesco di Giorgio Martini. Later parts of the building are clearly Florentine in style, particularly the inner courtyard, but it is not known who the designer was.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, ''[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/828 Historic Centre of Urbino]'', (retrieved 10-12-20123)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ferrara]], under the [[House of Este|Este]], was expanded in the late fifteenth century, with several new palaces being built such as the [[Palazzo dei Diamanti]] and [[Palazzo Schifanoia]] for [[Borso d'Este]]. In Milan, under the [[house of Visconti|Visconti]], the [[Certosa di Pavia]] was completed, and then later under the [[Sforza]], the Castello Sforzesco was built.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

[[File:Venezia - Ospedale - Foto G. Dall'Orto, 2 lug 2006 - 03.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scuola Grande di San Marco]], [[Venice]]]]

In Venice, [[San Zaccaria]] received its Renaissance façade at the hands of [[Antonio Gambello]] and [[Mauro Codussi]], begun in the 1480s.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Kaminski, ''Art and Architecture of Venice'', 1999, Könemann, {{ISBN|3-8290-2657-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giovanni Maria Falconetto]], the Veronese architect-sculptor, introduced Renaissance architecture to Padua with the Loggia Cornaro in the garden of [[Alvise Cornaro]].

In southern Italy, Renaissance masters were called to Naples by [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] after his conquest of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. The most notable examples of Renaissance architecture in that city are the [[Cappella Caracciolo]], attributed to Bramante, and the [[Palazzo Orsini di Gravina]], built by [[Gabriele d'Angelo]] between 1513 and 1549.

==High Renaissance==
[[File:Milan Santa Maria della Crazie Bramante.jpg|thumb|left|The crossing of Santa Maria della Grazie, Milan, Bramante (1490)]]
In the late 15th century and early 16th century, architects such as [[Bramante]], [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]] and others showed a mastery of the revived style and ability to apply it to buildings such as churches and city palazzo which were quite different from the structures of ancient times. The style became more decorated and ornamental, statuary, domes and [[cupola]]s becoming very evident.
The architectural period is known as the "High Renaissance" and coincides with the age of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]].

===Bramante===
[[Donato Bramante]], (1444–1514), was born in [[Urbino]] and turned from painting to architecture, finding his first important patronage under [[Ludovico Sforza]], Duke of Milan, for whom he produced a number of buildings over 20 years. After the fall of [[Milan]] to the French in 1499, Bramante travelled to Rome where he achieved great success under papal patronage.&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;
[[File:Santa maria delle grazie altar.jpg|thumb|The apse of Santa Maria delle Grazie, Milan.]]
Bramante’s finest architectural achievement in Milan is his addition of crossing and choir to the abbey church of [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)]]. This is a brick structure, the form of which owes much to the Northern Italian tradition of square domed [[Baptistery|baptisteries]]. The new building is almost centrally planned, except that, because of the site, the chancel extends further than the transept arms. The hemispherical dome, of approximately 20 metres across, rises up hidden inside an octagonal [[drum (architecture)|drum]] pierced at the upper level with arched classical openings. The whole exterior has delineated details decorated with the local [[terracotta]] ornamentation.

In Rome Bramante created what has been described as "a perfect architectural gem",&lt;ref name=BF /&gt; the [[Tempietto]] in the Cloister of [[San Pietro in Montorio]]. This small circular temple marks the spot where St Peter was martyred and is thus the most sacred site in Rome. The building adapts the style apparent in the remains of the [[Temple of Vesta]], the most sacred site of Ancient Rome. It is enclosed by and in spatial contrast with the cloister which surrounds it. As approached from the cloister, as in the picture above, it is seen framed by an arch and columns, the shape of which are echoed in its free-standing form.

Bramante went on to work at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] where he designed the impressive Cortili of St. Damaso and of the [[Cortile del Belvedere|Belvedere]]. In 1506 Bramante’s design for [[Pope Julius II]]’s rebuilding of [[St. Peter’s Basilica]] was selected, and the foundation stone laid. After Bramante’s death and many changes of plan, [[Michelangelo]], as chief architect, reverted to something closer to Bramante’s original proposal. &lt;sup&gt;See below- Michelangelo.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

[[File:Palais Farnese.jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo Farnese]], [[Rome]] (1534–1545). Designed by [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger|Sangallo]] and [[Michelangelo]].]]

===Sangallo===
[[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]], (1485–1546), was one of a family of [[Military engineering|military engineers]]. His uncle, [[Giuliano da Sangallo]] was one of those who submitted a plan for the rebuilding of St Peter’s and was briefly a co-director of the project, with [[Raphael]].&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;

Antonio da Sangallo also submitted a plan for St Peter’s and became the chief architect after the death of Raphael, to be succeeded himself by Michelangelo.

His fame does not rest upon his association with St Peter’s but in his building of the [[Farnese Palace]], “the grandest palace of this period”, started in 1530.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt; The impression of grandness lies in part in its sheer size, (56&amp;nbsp;m long by 29.5 meters high) and in its lofty location overlooking a broad piazza. It is also a building of beautiful proportion, unusual for such a large and luxurious house of the date in having been built principally of stuccoed brick, rather than of stone. Against the smooth pink-washed walls the stone quoins of the corners, the massive rusticated portal and the stately repetition of finely detailed windows give a powerful effect, setting a new standard of elegance in palace-building. The upper of the three equally sized floors was added by Michelangelo. It is probably just as well that this impressive building is of brick; the travertine for its architectural details came not from a quarry, but from the [[Colosseum]].&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

[[File:Palazzo Pandolfini, view 02 crop.JPG|thumb|left|Palazzo Pandolfini, Florence, by Raphael]]

===Raphael===
[[Raphael]], (1483–1520), [[Urbino]], trained under [[Perugino]] in [[Perugia]] before moving to Florence, was for a time the chief architect for [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter’s]], working in conjunction with Antonio Sangallo. He also designed a number of buildings, most of which were finished by others. His single most influential work is the Palazzo Pandolfini in Florence with its two stories of strongly articulated windows of a "[[Aedicula|tabernacle]]" type, each set around with ordered pilasters, cornice and alternate arched and triangular pediments.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;
{{clear}}

==Mannerism==
{{main|Mannerism}}
'''Mannerism''' in architecture was marked by widely diverging tendencies in the work of [[Michelangelo]], [[Giulio Romano]], [[Baldassare Peruzzi]] and [[Andrea Palladio]], that led to the Baroque style in which the same architectural vocabulary was used for very different rhetoric.
[[File:Palazzo Massimo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne]].]]

===Peruzzi===
[[Baldassare Peruzzi]], (1481–1536), was an architect born in [[Siena]], but working in Rome, whose work bridges the High Renaissance and the Mannerist.
His [[Villa Farnesina]] of 1509 is a very regular monumental cube of two equal stories, the bays being strongly articulated by orders of pilasters. The building is unusual for its frescoed walls.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

Peruzzi’s most famous work is the [[Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne]] in Rome. The unusual features of this building are that its façade curves gently around a curving street. It has in its ground floor a dark central portico running parallel to the street, but as a semi enclosed space, rather than an open loggia. Above this rise three undifferentiated floors, the upper two with identical small horizontal windows in thin flat frames which contrast strangely with the deep porch, which has served, from the time of its construction, as a refuge to the city’s poor.&lt;ref name= Pevs /&gt;

[[File:Palazzo Te Mantova 1.jpg|thumb|[[Palazzo Te]], Mantua]]

===Giulio Romano===
[[Giulio Romano]] (1499–1546), was a pupil of Raphael, assisting him on various works for the Vatican. Romano was also a highly inventive designer, working for [[Frederick II, Duke of Mantua|Federico II Gonzaga]] at Mantua on the [[Palazzo Te]], (1524–1534), a project which combined his skills as architect, sculptor and painter. In this work, incorporating garden [[grotto]]es and extensive frescoes, he uses [[illusion|illusionistic effects]], surprising combinations of architectural form and texture, and the frequent use of features that seem somewhat disproportionate or out of alignment. The total effect is eerie and disturbing. Ilan Rachum cites Romano as ''“one of the first promoters of Mannerism”''.&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;

===Michelangelo===
[[Michelangelo Buonarroti]] (1475–1564) was one of the creative giants whose achievements mark the High Renaissance. He excelled in each of the fields of painting, sculpture and architecture and his achievements brought about significant changes in each area. His architectural fame lies chiefly in two buildings: the interiors of the [[Laurentian Library]] and its lobby at the monastery of San Lorenzo in Florence, and [[St Peter's Basilica]] in Rome.

St Peter's was ''"the greatest creation of the Renaissance"'',&lt;ref name=BF /&gt; and a great number of architects contributed their skills to it. But at its completion, there was more of Michelangelo’s design than of any other architect, before or after him.

[[File:Petersdom von Engelsburg gesehen.jpg|thumb|St Peter's Basilica]]

====St Peter's====
The plan that was accepted at the laying of the foundation stone in 1506 was that by Bramante. Various changes in plan occurred in the series of architects that succeeded him, but Michelangelo, when he took over the project in 1546, reverted to Bramante’s Greek-cross plan and redesigned the piers, the walls and the dome, giving the lower weight-bearing members massive proportions and eliminating the encircling aisles from the chancel and identical transept arms. [[Helen Gardner (art historian)|Helen Gardner]] says: "Michelangelo, with a few strokes of the pen, converted its snowflake complexity into a massive, cohesive unity."&lt;ref name= Gardner /&gt;

Michelangelo’s dome was a masterpiece of design using two masonry shells, one within the other and crowned by a massive lantern supported, as at Florence, on ribs. For the exterior of the building he designed a giant order which defines every external bay, the whole lot being held together by a wide cornice which runs unbroken like a rippling ribbon around the entire building.

There is a wooden model of the dome, showing its outer shell as hemispherical. When Michelangelo died in 1564, the building had reached the height of the drum. The architect who succeeded Michelangelo was [[Giacomo della Porta]]. The dome, as built, has a much steeper projection than the dome of the model. It is generally presumed that it was della Porta who made this change to the design, to lessen the outward thrust. But, in fact it is unknown who it was that made this change, and it is equally possible and a stylistic likelihood that the person who decided upon the more dynamic outline was Michelangelo himself at some time during the years that he supervised the project.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner and Gardener suggest that Michelangelo began with the idea of a pointed dome, as in Florence, then in his old age reverted to the lower silhouette, and that della Porta stuck to Michelangelo's original concept. Mignacca, on the other hand, suggests that the pointed dome was Michelangelo's final, and brilliant, solution to the apparent visual tension within the building.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laurentian Library vestibule.jpg|thumb|left|The vestibule of the Laurentian Library]]

====Laurentian Library====
Michelangelo was at his most Mannerist in the design of the vestibule of the [[Laurentian Library]], also built by him to house the [[Cosimo de' Medici|Medici]] collection of books at the convent of [[San Lorenzo, Florence|San Lorenzo]] in Florence, the same San Lorenzo’s at which [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] had recast church architecture into a Classical mold and established clear formula for the use of [[Classical orders]] and their various components.

Michelangelo takes all Brunelleschi’s components and bends them to his will. The Library is upstairs. It is a long low building with an ornate wooden ceiling, a matching floor and crowded with corrals finished by his successors to Michelangelo’s design. But it is a light room, the natural lighting streaming through a long row of windows that appear positively crammed between the order of pilasters that march along the wall. The vestibule, on the other hand, is tall, taller than it is wide and is crowded by a large staircase that pours out of the library in what [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] refers to as a “flow of lava”, and bursts in three directions when it meets the balustrade of the landing. It is an intimidating staircase, made all the more so because the rise of the stairs at the center is steeper than at the two sides, fitting only eight steps into the space of nine.

The space is crowded and it is to be expected that the wall spaces would be divided by pilasters of low projection. But Michelangelo has chosen to use paired columns, which, instead of standing out boldly from the wall, he has sunk deep into recesses within the wall itself. In San Lorenzo's church nearby, Brunelleschi used little scrolling console brackets to break the strongly horizontal line of the course above the arcade. Michelangelo has borrowed Brunelleschi’s motifs and stood each pair of sunken columns on a pair of twin console [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]]. [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] says the ''“Laurenziana... reveals Mannerism in its most sublime architectural form”''.&lt;ref name= Pevs /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Goldscheider, ''Michelangelo'', 1964, Phaidon.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Church of the Gesù, Rome crop.jpg|thumb|left|Il Gesù, designed by Giacomo della Porta.]]

===Giacomo della Porta===
[[Giacomo della Porta]], (c.1533–1602), was famous as the architect who made the dome of St Peter’s Basilica a reality. The change in outline between the dome as it appears in the model and the dome as it was built, has brought about speculation as to whether the changes originated with della Porta or with Michelangelo himself.

Della Porta spent nearly all his working life in Rome, designing villas, palazzi and churches in the Mannerist style. One of his most famous works is the façade of the [[Church of the Gesù]], a project that he inherited from his teacher [[Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola]]. Most characteristics of the original design are maintained, subtly transformed to give more weight to the central section, where della Porta uses, among other motifs, a low triangular pediment overlaid on a segmental one above the main door. The upper storey and its pediment give the impression of compressing the lower one. The center section, like that of Sant'Andrea at Mantua, is based on the Triumphal Arch, but has two clear horizontal divisions like [[Santa Maria Novella]]. &lt;sup&gt;See Alberti above.&lt;/sup&gt; The problem of linking the aisles to the nave is solved using Alberti’s scrolls, in contrast to Vignola’s solution which provided much smaller brackets and four statues to stand above the paired pilasters, visually weighing down the corners of the building. The influence of the design may be seen in Baroque churches throughout Europe.

===Andrea Palladio===
[[Andrea Palladio]], (1508–80), "the most influential architect of the whole Renaissance"',&lt;ref name= BF /&gt; was, as a stonemason, introduced to Humanism by the poet [[Giangiorgio Trissino]]. His first major architectural commission was the rebuilding of the [[Basilica Palladiana]] at [[Vicenza]], in the [[Veneto]] where he was to work most of his life.&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;
[[File:La Rotonda.png|thumb|[[Villa Capra La Rotonda]]]]
Palladio was to transform the architectural style of both palaces and churches by taking a different perspective on the notion of Classicism. While the architects of Florence and Rome looked to structures like the [[Colosseum]] and the [[Arch of Constantine]] to provide formulae, Palladio looked to classical temples with their simple peristyle form. When he used the “[[Arch of Constantine|triumphal arch]]” motif of a large arched opening with lower square-topped opening on either side, he invariably applied it on a small scale, such as windows, rather than on a large scale as Alberti used it at Sant’Andrea’s. This Ancient Roman motif&lt;ref&gt;described by the architectural writer [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475–1554) in ''Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetivaref''&lt;/ref&gt; is often referred to as the ''Palladian Arch''.

The best known of Palladio’s domestic buildings is [[Villa Capra]], otherwise known as "la Rotonda", a centrally planned house with a domed central hall and four identical façades, each with a temple-like portico like that of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Wundram, Thomas Pape, Paolo Marton, ''Andrea Palladio'', Taschen, {{ISBN|3-8228-0271-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Villa Cornaro]], the projecting portico of the north façade and recessed loggia of the garden façade are of two [[Classical order|ordered]] stories, the upper forming a [[balcony]].&lt;ref&gt;Branco Mitrovic and Stephen R. Wassell, ''Andrea Palladio: Villa Cornaro in Piombino Dese'' (New York: Acanthus Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-926494-36-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Alberti, della Porta and others, in the designing of a church façade, Palladio was confronted by the problem of visually linking the aisles to the nave while maintaining and defining the structure of the building. Palladio’s solution was entirely different from that employed by della Porta. At the [[church of San Giorgio Maggiore]] in Venice he overlays a tall temple, its columns raised on high plinths, over another low wide temple façade, its columns rising from the basements and its narrow lintel and pilasters appearing behind the giant order of the central nave.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

==Progression from Early Renaissance through to Baroque==
[[File:1993-1994-Giardino Giusti (Verona)-testo e photo Paolo Villa-nA2-tesi Accademia Belle Arti Bologna-portone di Palazzo Giusti.jpg|thumb|[[Keystone (architecture)|Keystone]] with profile of man, [[Palazzo Giusti]], Verona, Italy]]
In Italy, there appears to be a seamless progression from Early Renaissance architecture through the High Renaissance and Mannerist to the Baroque style. Pevsner comments about the vestibule of the Laurentian Library that it "has often been said that the motifs of the walls show Michelangelo as the father of the Baroque".

While continuity may be the case in Italy, it was not necessarily the case elsewhere. The adoption of the Renaissance style of architecture was slower in some areas than in others, as may be seen in England, for example. Indeed, as [[Pope Julius II]] was having the ancient Basilica of St. Peter’s demolished to make way for the new, [[Henry VII of England]] was adding a glorious new chapel in the [[English Gothic architecture|Perpendicular Gothic]] style to [[Westminster Abbey]].

Likewise, the style that was to become known as Baroque evolved in Italy in the early 17th century, at about the time that the first fully Renaissance buildings were constructed at Greenwich and Whitehall in England,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Queen's House, Greenwich]] and the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall]]&lt;/ref&gt; after a prolonged period of experimentation with Classical motifs applied to local architectural forms, or conversely, the adoption of Renaissance structural forms in the broadest sense with an absence of the formulae that governed their use. While the English were just discovering what the rules of Classicism were, the Italians were experimenting with methods of breaking them. In England, following the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the Monarchy in 1660, the architectural climate changed, and taste moved in the direction of the Baroque. Rather than evolving, as it did in Italy, it arrived fully fledged.

In a similar way, in many parts of Europe that had few purely classical and ordered buildings like Brunelleschi’s Santo Spirito and Michelozzo’s Medici Riccardi Palace, Baroque architecture appeared almost unheralded, on the heels of a sort of Proto-Renaissance local style.&lt;ref name= Jan&gt;Janson, H.W., Anthony F. Janson (1997). ''History of Art'', New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc.. {{ISBN|0-8109-3442-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of the Baroque and its replacement of traditional and more conservative Renaissance architecture was particularly apparent in the building of churches as part of the [[Counter Reformation]].&lt;ref name= Pevs /&gt;
{{main|Baroque architecture}}

==Spread in Europe==
&lt;!---NOTE: CHRONOLOGICAL.  REGIONAL. NOT ALPHABETICAL. ---&gt;
{{main|Northern Renaissance}}
The 16th century saw the economic and political ascendancy of France and Spain, and then later of Holland, England, Germany and Russia. The result was that these places began to import the Renaissance style as indicators of their new cultural position. This also meant that it was not until about 1500 and later that signs of Renaissance architectural style began to appear outside Italy.

Though Italian architects were highly sought after, such as [[Sebastiano Serlio]] in France, [[Aristotile Fioravanti]] in [[Russia]], and [[Francesco Fiorentino]] in [[Poland]], soon, non-Italians were studying Italian architecture and translating it into their own idiom. These included [[Philibert de l'Orme]] (1510–1570) in France, [[Juan Bautista de Toledo]] (died: 1567) in Spain, [[Inigo Jones]] (1573–1652) in England and [[Elias Holl]] (1573–1646) in Germany.&lt;ref name= Jan /&gt;

Books or ornament prints with [[engraving|engraved]] illustrations demonstrating plans and ornament were very important in spreading Renaissance styles in Northern Europe, with among the most important authors being [[Androuet du Cerceau]] in France, and [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]] in the Netherlands, and [[Wendel Dietterlin]], author of ''Architectura'' (1593–94) in Germany.

===Croatia===
[[File:St. Jacobuskathedraal ; Sibenik.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of St. James, Šibenik]]]]
{{main|Architecture of Croatia}}
In the 15th century, [[Croatia]] was divided into three states – the northern and central part of Croatia and [[Slavonia]] were in union with the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], while [[Dalmatia]], with the exception of independent [[Dubrovnik]], was under the rule of the [[Venetian Republic]]. The [[Cathedral of St. James, Šibenik|Cathedral of St.James]] in [[Šibenik]], was begun in 1441 in the Gothic style by [[Giorgio da Sebenico]] ''(Juraj Dalmatinac)''. Its unusual construction does not use mortar, the stone blocks, [[pilaster]]s and [[ribs]] being bonded with [[joints]] and [[Groove (engineering)|slots]] in the way that was usual in wooden constructions. In 1477 the work was unfinished, and continued under [[Niccolò di Giovanni Fiorentino]] who respected the mode of construction and the plan of the former architect, but continued the work which includes the upper windows, the vaults and the dome, in the Renaissance style. The combination of a high barrel vault with lower half-barrel vaults over the aisles the gives the façade its distinctive [[trefoil]] shape, the first of this type in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506013344/http://www.sibenik.hr/vodic-eng/sibenik/kulturno_povijesna_bastina2.asp |archivedate=6 May 2009 |url=http://www.sibenik.hr/vodic-eng/sibenik/kulturno_povijesna_bastina2.asp |title=St James’s Cathedral}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cathedral was listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]] in 2001.

{{main|Renaissance architecture in Central Europe}}

One of the earliest places to be influenced by the Renaissance style of architecture was the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The style appeared following the marriage of King [[Matthias Corvinus]] and [[Beatrice of Naples]] in 1476. Many Italian artists, craftsmen and [[masonry|masons]] arrived at [[Buda]] with the new queen. Important remains of the Early Renaissance summer palace of King Matthias can be found in [[Visegrád]]. The Ottoman conquest of Hungary after 1526 cut short the development of Renaissance architecture in the country and destroyed its most famous examples. Today, the only completely preserved work of Hungarian Renaissance architecture is the Bakócz Chapel (commissioned by the Hungarian cardinal [[Tamás Bakócz]]), now part of the [[Esztergom Basilica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hung-art.hu/kep/zmisc/faragvan/162_sz/bakocz01.jpg Image of Bakócz Chapel] (1506–08)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Russian architecture|Renaissance architecture in Eastern Europe}}
Prince [[Ivan III]] introduced Renaissance architecture to [[Russia]] by inviting a number of architects from [[Italy]], who brought new construction techniques and some Renaissance style elements with them, while in general following the traditional designs of the [[Russian architecture]]. In 1475 the Bolognese architect [[Aristotele Fioravanti]] came to rebuild the [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin]], damaged in an earthquake. Fioravanti was given the 12th-century [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir|Vladimir Cathedral]] as a model, and produced a design combining traditional Russian style with a Renaissance sense of spaciousness, proportion and symmetry.

In 1485 Ivan III commissioned the building of a royal [[Terem Palace]] within the Kremlin, with [[Aloisio da Milano]] being the architect of the first three floors. Aloisio da Milano, as well as the other Italian architects, also greatly contributed to the construction of the [[Kremlin wall]]s [[Kremlin towers|and towers]]. The small banqueting hall of the [[Russian Tsar]]s, called the [[Palace of Facets]] because of its facetted upper story, is the work of two Italians, [[Marco Ruffo]] and [[Pietro Solario]], and shows a more Italian style. In 1505, an Italian known in Russia as [[Aleviz Novyi]] built 12 churches for Ivan III, including the [[Cathedral of the Archangel]], a building remarkable for the successful blending of Russian tradition, Orthodox requirements and Renaissance style.

===Poland===
{{main|Renaissance in Poland|Renaissance architecture in Central Europe|Mannerist architecture and sculpture in Poland}}
[[Polish Renaissance]] architecture is divided into three periods:
The First period (1500–50), is the so-called "Italian". Most of Renaissance buildings were building of this time were by Italian architects, mainly from [[Florence]] including [[Francesco Fiorentino]] and [[Bartolomeo Berrecci]] ([[Wawel]] Courtyard, [[Sigismund's Chapel]]).

In the Second period (1550–1600), Renaissance architecture became more common, with the beginnings of [[Mannerist]] and under the influence of the Netherlands, particularly in [[Pomerania]]. Buildings include the New [[Sukiennice|Cloth Hall]] in Kraków and city halls in [[Tarnów]], [[Sandomierz]], [[Chełm]] (demolished) and most famously in [[Poznań]].

In the Third period (1600–50), the rising power of [[Jesuits]] and [[Counter Reformation]] gave impetus to the development of Mannerist architecture and Baroque.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Busch, Bernd Lohse, Hans Weigert, ''Baukunst der Renaissance in Europa.

===Crown of Bohemia===
{{main|Czech Renaissance architecture}}
[[File:Letohrádek královny Anny by Crazyspeak (2).jpg|thumb|right|Royal Summer Palace in Prague considered the purest Renaissance architecture outside Italy&lt;ref name=guide&gt;{{cite book|title=Prague : City Guidebook|date=2000|publisher=Kartografie|location=Prague|isbn=80-7011-597-1|page=40|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Renaissance style first appeared in the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Crown of Bohemia]] in the 1490s. Bohemia together with its incorporated lands, especially Moravia, thus ranked among the areas of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] with the earliest known examples of the Renaissance architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamlin|first1=Alfred D.|title=History of architecture|date=2010|publisher=Salzwasser-Verlag|location=Bremen|isbn=9783861952503|page=338|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=g89phgpRZOEC&amp;pg=PA338&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lands of the Bohemian Crown were never part of the ancient [[Roman Empire]], thus they missed their own ancient classical heritage and had to be dependent on the primarily Italian models. As well as in other Central European countries the Gothic style kept its position especially in the church architecture. The traditional [[Gothic architecture]] was considered timeless and therefore able to express the sacredness. The Renaissance architecture coexisted with the Gothic style in Bohemia and Moravia until the late 16th century (e. g. the residential part of a palace was built in the modern Renaissance style but its chapel was designed with Gothic elements). The façades of Czech Renaissance buildings were often decorated with [[sgraffito]] (figural or ornamental).

During the reign of Holy Roman Emperor and Bohemian King [[Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]], the city of Prague became one of the most important European centers of the late Renaissance art (so-called [[Northern Mannerism|Mannerism]]). Nevertheless, not many architecturally significant buildings have been preserved from that time.

===France===
[[File:Chambord-wide-2004.jpg|thumb|French Renaissance: [[Château de Chambord]] (1519–39)]]
{{main|French Renaissance architecture}}
During the early years of the 16th century the French were involved in wars in northern Italy, bringing back to France not just the Renaissance art treasures as their war [[Looting|booty]], but also stylistic ideas. In the [[Loire Valley]] a wave of building was carried and many Renaissance châteaux appeared at this time, the earliest example being the [[Château d'Amboise]] (c. 1495) in which [[Leonardo da Vinci]] spent his last years. The style became dominant under [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (See [[Châteaux of the Loire Valley]]).&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref name= W&amp;M /&gt;

[[File:Antwerp town hall, 25 april 2007 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Antwerp City Hall]] (finished in 1564)]]

===Netherlands/Flanders===
{{main|Renaissance in the Netherlands}}
As in painting, Renaissance architecture took some time to reach the Netherlands and did not entirely supplant the Gothic elements. An architect directly influenced by the Italian masters was [[Cornelis Floris de Vriendt]], who designed the [[Antwerp City Hall|city hall of Antwerpen]], finished in 1564. The style sometimes known as "Antwerp Mannerism", keeping a similar overall structure to late-Gothic buildings, but with larger windows and much florid decoration and detailing in Renaissance styles, was widely influential across Northern Europe, for example in [[Elizabethan architecture]], and is part of the wider movement of [[Northern Mannerism]].

In the early 17th century [[Dutch Republic]], [[Hendrick de Keyser]] played an important role in developing the '''Amsterdam Renaissance''' style, which has local characteristics including the prevalence of tall narrow town-houses, the "trapgevel" or [[Crow-stepped gable|Dutch gable]] and the employment of decorative triangular pediments over doors and windows in which the apex rises much more steeply than in most other Renaissance architecture, but in keeping with the profile of the gable. Carved stone details are often of low profile, in [[strapwork]] resembling leatherwork, a stylistic feature originating in the [[School of Fontainebleau]]. This feature was exported to England.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref name= W&amp;M /&gt;
&lt;!---NOTE: CHRONOLOGICAL.  REGIONAL. NOT ALPHABETICAL. ---&gt;

===Germany===
[[File:Juleum Helmstedt.jpg|thumb|[[University of Helmstedt|Juleum]] in [[Helmstedt]], Germany (example of [[Weser Renaissance]])]]
{{main|German Renaissance}}
The Renaissance in Germany was inspired first by German philosophers and artists such as [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Johannes Reuchlin]] who visited Italy. Important early examples of this period are especially the [[Landshut Residence]], the [[Heidelberg Castle|Castle]] in [[Heidelberg]], [[Schloss Johannisburg|Johannisburg Palace]] in [[Aschaffenburg]], [[Schloss Weilburg]], the [[Augsburg Town Hall|City Hall]] and [[Fuggerhäuser|Fugger Houses]] in [[Augsburg]] and [[St. Michael's Church, Munich|St. Michael]] in [[Munich]]. A particular form of Renaissance architecture in Germany is the [[Weser Renaissance]], with prominent examples such as the [[Town Hall of Bremen|City Hall]] of [[Bremen]] and the [[University of Helmstedt|Juleum]] in [[Helmstedt]].

In July 1567 the city council of [[Cologne]] approved a design in the Renaissance style by Wilhelm Vernukken for a two storied loggia for [[Cologne City Hall]]. [[Michaelskirche (München)|St Michael]] in [[Munich]] is the largest Renaissance church north of the Alps. It was built by [[William V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke William V]] of [[Bavaria]] between 1583 and 1597 as a spiritual center for the [[Counter Reformation]] and was inspired by the Church of [[il Gesù]] in Rome. The architect is unknown.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref name=A.M /&gt;&lt;ref name= W&amp;M /&gt; Many examples of [[List of Brick Renaissance buildings|Brick Renaissance buildings]] can be found in [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] old towns, such as [[Stralsund]], [[Wismar]], [[Lübeck]], [[Lüneburg]], [[Friedrichstadt]] and [[Stade]]. Notable German Renaissance architects include [[Friedrich Sustris]], [[Benedikt Rejt]], [[Abraham van den Blocke]], [[Elias Holl]] and [[Hans Krumpper]].

===England===
[[File:Hardwick Hall 3 (7027835143).jpg|thumb|English Renaissance: [[Hardwick Hall]] (1590–1597).]]
{{main|Elizabethan architecture|Palladian architecture}}
Renaissance architecture arrived in England during the reign of [[Elizabeth I]], having first spread through the [[Low countries]] where among other features it acquired versions of the [[Crow-stepped gable|Dutch gable]], and [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[strapwork]] in geometric designs adorning the walls. The new style tended to manifest itself in large square tall houses such as [[Longleat House]].

The first great exponent of Italian Renaissance architecture in England was [[Inigo Jones]] (1573–1652), who had studied architecture in Italy where the influence of Palladio was very strong. Jones returned to England full of enthusiasm for the new movement and immediately began to design such buildings as the [[Queen's House]] at [[Greenwich]] in 1616 and the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall|Banqueting House]] at [[Whitehall]] three years later. These works, with their clean lines, and symmetry were revolutionary in a country still enamoured with mullion windows, crenellations and turrets.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Summerson, ''Architecture in Britain 1530–1830'', 1977 ed., Pelican, {{ISBN|0-14-056003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===

[[File:Ventana2.jpg|thumb|[[El Escorial|The Escorial]] (1563–1584), [[Madrid]].]]
In Spain, Renaissance began to be grafted to Gothic forms in the last decades of the 15th century. The new style is called [[Plateresque]], because of the extremely decorated façade, that brought to the mind the decorative motifs of the intricately detailed work of [[silversmith]]s, the ''Plateros''. Classical orders and candelabra motifs (''a candelieri'') combined freely into symmetrical wholes.

From the mid-sixteenth century, under such architects as Pedro Machuca, [[Juan Bautista de Toledo]] and [[Juan de Herrera]] there was a closer adherence to the art of ancient Rome, sometimes anticipating [[Mannerism]], examples of which include the [[palace of Charles V]] in [[Granada]] and the [[Escorial]].&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref name=A.M /&gt;&lt;ref name= W&amp;M /&gt;

{{main|Renaissance architecture in Portugal|Portuguese Renaissance}}
As in Spain, the adoption of the Renaissance style in Portugal was gradual. The so-called [[Manueline]] style (c. 1490–1535) married Renaissance elements to Gothic structures with the superficial application of exuberant ornament similar to the [[Isabelline Gothic]] of Spain. Examples of Manueline include the [[Belém Tower]], a defensive building of Gothic form decorated with Renaissance-style [[loggia]]s, and the [[Jerónimos Monastery]], with Renaissance ornaments decorating portals, columns and cloisters.

The first "pure" Renaissance structures appear under [[John III of Portugal|King John III]], like the Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Conceição in Tomar (1532–40), the ''Porta Especiosa'' of [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra|Coimbra Cathedral]] and the Graça Church at [[Évora]] (c. 1530–1540), as well as the cloisters of the Cathedral of [[Viseu]] (c. 1528–1534) and [[Convent of Christ]] in Tomar (John III Cloisters, 1557–1591). The [[Lisbon]] buildings of [[Igreja de São Roque (Lisbon)|São Roque Church]] (1565–87) and the Mannerist [[Monastery of São Vicente de Fora]] (1582–1629), strongly influenced religious architecture in both Portugal and its colonies in the next centuries.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

[[File:Frederiksborg Castle and boat crop.jpg|thumb|left|Nordic Renaissance: [[Frederiksborg Palace]] (1602–20)]]

===Scandinavia===
{{main|Architecture of Denmark|Architecture}}
The Renaissance architecture that found its way to Scandinavia was influenced by the Flemish architecture, and included high gables and a castle air as demonstrated in the architecture of Frederiksborg Palace. Consequently, much of the Neo-Renaissance to be found in the Scandinavian countries is derived from this source.

In Denmark, Renaissance architecture thrived during the reigns of [[Frederick II of Denmark|Frederick II]] and especially [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]]. Inspired by the French castles of the times, Flemish architects designed masterpieces such as Kronborg Castle in Helsingør and Frederiksborg Palace in Hillerød. Frederiksborg Palace (1602–1620) in Hillerod is the largest Renaissance palace in Scandinavia.

Elsewhere, in Sweden, with [[Gustav Vasa]]'s seizure of power and the onset of the Protestant reformation, church construction and aristocratic building projects came to a near standstill. During this time period, several magnificent so-called Vasa castles appeared. They were erected at strategic locations to control the country as well as to accommodate the travelling royal court. [[Gripsholm Castle]], [[Kalmar Castle]] and [[Vadstena Castle]] are known for their fusion of medieval elements with Renaissance architecture.

The architecture of [[Norway]] was influenced partly by the occurrence of the plague during the Renaissance era. After the Black Death, monumental construction in Norway came to a standstill. There are few examples of Renaissance architecture in Norway, the most prominent being renovations to the medieval [[Rosenkrantz Tower]] in Bergen, [[Barony Rosendal]] in Hardanger, and the contemporary [[Austrått|Austrat manor]] near Trondheim, and parts of [[Akershus Fortress]].

There is little evidence of Renaissance influence in Finnish architecture.

===Baltic States===
[[File:House of Blackheads - Riga.jpg|thumb|right|The [[House of the Blackheads]] in [[Riga]], Latvia]]
{{main|Renaissance in Poland|Architecture of Estonia}}
The Renaissance arrived late in what is today [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]], the so-called [[Baltic States]], and did not make a great imprint architecturally. It was a politically tumultuous time, marked by the decline of the [[State of the Teutonic Order]] and the [[Livonian War]].

In Estonia, artistic influences came from Dutch, Swedish and Polish sources.&lt;ref name=toivo&gt;{{cite book |last=Miljan |first=Toivo |title=Historical Dictionary of Estonia |year=2004 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810865716 |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building of the [[House of the Blackheads (Tallinn)|Brotherhood of the Blackheads in Tallinn]] with a façade designed by [[Arent Passer]], is the only truly Renaissance building in the country that has survived more or less intact.&lt;ref name= "Viirand"&gt;{{cite book | last = Viirand| first = Tiiu| authorlink = | title = Estonia.

Latvian Renaissance architecture was influenced by Polish-Lithuanian and Dutch style, with [[Mannerism]] following from [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] without intermediaries. [[St. John's Church, Riga|St. John's Church]] in the Latvian capital of [[Riga]] is example of an earlier Gothic church which was reconstructed in 1587–89 by the Dutch architect Gert Freze (Joris Phraeze). The prime example of Renaissance architecture in Latvia is the heavily decorated [[House of the Blackheads]], rebuilt from an earlier Medieval structure into its present Mannerist forms as late as 1619–25 by the architects A. and L. Jansen. It was destroyed during World War II and rebuilt during the 1990s.&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;{{cite book |last= Campbell|first= Gordon (ed.)|authorlink= |title= The Grove Encyclopedia of Northern Renaissance Art |url= |year= 2009|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= |isbn= 9780195334661|volume=2|page=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithuania meanwhile formed one half of the large Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth. Renaissance influences grew stronger during the reign of the [[Grand Duke of Lithuania|Grand Dukes of Lithuania]] [[Sigismund I the Old]] and [[Sigismund II Augustus]]. The [[Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania]] (destroyed in 1801, a copy built in 2002–2009) show Italian influences. Several architects of Italian origin were active in the country, including [[Bernardino Zanobi de Gianotis]], [[Giovanni Cini]] and [[Giovanni Maria Mosca]].&lt;ref name="grove2"&gt;{{cite book |last= Campbell|first= Gordon (ed.)|authorlink= |title= The Grove Encyclopedia of Northern Renaissance Art |url= |year= 2009|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= |isbn= 9780195334661|volume=2|pages=486–487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
{{main|Renaissance Revival architecture}}
[[File:Cathédrale Marie-Reine du Monde, intérieur.jpg|thumb|[[Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral]], [[Montreal]] (19th century)]]
During the 19th century there was a conscious revival of the style in [[Renaissance Revival architecture]], that paralleled the [[Gothic Revival]]. Whereas the Gothic style was perceived by architectural theorists&lt;ref&gt;[[John Ruskin]]&lt;br&gt;[[Cambridge Camden Society]]&lt;/ref&gt; as being the most appropriate style for Church building, the Renaissance palazzo was a good model for urban secular buildings requiring an appearance of dignity and reliability such as banks, gentlemen's clubs and apartment blocks.&lt;ref&gt;An influential example, The [[Reform Club]] in London (1841) by [[Charles Barry]] was closely inspired by the [[Palazzo Farnese]], discussed above [http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/england/london/barry/reform.html Photos and commentary]&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings that sought to impress, such as the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera]], were often of a more Mannerist or Baroque style.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]]&lt;/ref&gt; Architects of factories, office blocks and department stores continued to use the Renaissance palazzo form into the 20th century, in [[Mediterranean Revival Style architecture]] with an Italian Renaissance emphasis.&lt;ref name= Pevs /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Sullivan]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the concepts and forms of Renaissance architecture can be traced through subsequent architectural movements—from Renaissance to High-Renaissance, to Mannerism, to Baroque (or [[Rococo]]), to [[Neo-Classicism]], and to [[Eclecticism]].  While Renaissance style and motifs were largely purged from [[Modernism]], they have been reasserted in some [[Postmodern architecture]]. The influence of Renaissance architecture can still be seen in many of the modern styles and rules of architecture today.

==History==
The RCA was founded in [[Somerset House]] in 1837 as the '''Government School of Design'''{{r|aim25}} or '''Metropolitan School of Design'''.{{r|riba}}  [[Richard Burchett]] became head of the school in 1852.{{r|dnb}} In 1853 it was expanded and moved to [[Marlborough House]], and then, in 1853{{r|aim25}} or 1857,{{r|riba|dnb}} to [[South Kensington]], on the same site as the [[South Kensington Museum]]. It was renamed the '''Normal Training School of Art''' in 1857{{r|riba}} and the '''National Art Training School''' in 1863.{{r|dnb}} During the later 19th century it was primarily a [[teacher training college]]; pupils during this period included [[George Clausen]], [[Christopher Dresser]], [[Luke Fildes]], [[Kate Greenaway]] and [[Gertrude Jekyll]].{{r|dnb}}

In 1896{{r|aim25}} or 1897{{r|riba}} the school received the name '''Royal College of Art''', and the emphasis of teaching there shifted to the practice of art and design.&lt;ref name=aim25/&gt; Teaching of [[graphic design]], [[industrial design]] and [[product design]] began in the mid-twentieth century. The school expanded further in the 1960s, and in 1967 it received a  [[Royal Charter]] which gave it the status of an independent university with the power to grant its own degrees.&lt;ref name=aim25/&gt;

==Campuses==
[[File:Darwin Building, Royal College of Art in London, spring 2013.JPG|thumb|right|The Darwin Building in [[Kensington Gore]]]]

The RCA has two campuses, in [[South Kensington]] and in [[Battersea]].{{r|rca}} The Darwin Building in [[Kensington Gore]] dates from the 1960s and is a Grade II [[listed building]]. It was designed by a team of RCA staff members, [[H. T. Cadbury-Brown]], [[Hugh Casson]] and Robert Goodden.&lt;ref name=dunnett/&gt;

In 1991 the [[sculpture]] department moved to a converted factory across the river [[Thames]] in Battersea. In the early 2000s the college conceived a substantial second campus being created on the site, with a minibus service linking it to Kensington. Thus, after a successful redevelopment of the premises by [[Wright &amp; Wright]] (budget £4.3m, floor area 2,500 sq m), the present Sculpture Building opened in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal College of Art Sculpture Building officially reopens|url=http://www.rca.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/rca-sculpture-building-officially-reopens/|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bizley|first1=Graham|title=Wright &amp; Wright's RCA sculpture department refurb|url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/wright-and-wright%E2%80%99s-rca-sculpture-department-refurb/3131922.article|publisher=BD online 23 January 2009|accessdate=6 October 2015}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A masterplan was commissioned by [[Haworth Tompkins]]  and phase 1 of their three phase design was completed with the opening of the Sackler Building on 19 November 2009, to house the painting department. Its name commemorates a major gift by [[Mortimer Sackler|The Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The new RCA Painting Building is now open|url=http://www.rca.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/the-new-rca-painting-building-is-now-open/|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sackler Building by Haworth Tompkins|url=http://www.dezeen.com/2009/12/02/the-sackler-building-by-haworth-tompkins/|publisher=Dezeen 2 December 2009|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RCA Sackler Building|url=https://vimeo.com/7822996|publisher=AJ Building Study video|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dyson Building, named in honour of [[James Dyson]], whose educational charity donated £5m to the development, was opened on 24 September 2012. It is the home for [[printmaking]] and [[photography]], and contains an innovation wing where start-up designers can launch their businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dyson Building by Haworth Tompkins|url=http://www.dezeen.com/2012/09/28/the-dyson-building-by-haworth-tompkins/|publisher=Dezeen 28 September 2012|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Will|title=Royal College of Art by Haworth Tompkins|url=http://www.architectural-review.com/buildings/london-schools-part-one-royal-college-of-art-by-haworth-tompkins/8643316.article|publisher=AR online 27 February 2013|accessdate=6 October 2015}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Woo Building was opened on 30 September 2015, completing the Battersea project. It is named in honour of [[Woo Po-shing|Sir Po-Shing and Lady Helen Woo]], who have funded scholarships at the RCA since the 1990s. It accommodates the Ceramics &amp; Glass and Jewellery &amp; Metal programmes. The building's [[Anodizing|anodised aluminium]] gates were designed by alumnus Max Lamb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jordan|first1=Sarah|title=RCA opens state of the art Woo Building for jewellery and silversmithing students|url=http://www.retail-jeweller.com/business/rca-opens-state-of-the-art-woo-building-for-jewellery-students/5079631.article|publisher=Retail Jeweller 2 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Gates installed for the opening of the Woo Building Battersea|url=http://www.rca.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/new-gates-installed-opening-woo-building-battersea/|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courses==
The RCA offers Graduate Diploma, [[Master of Arts|MA]], [[Master of Philosophy|MRes, MPhil]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degrees in twenty-eight subject areas, divided into four schools: [[architecture]], arts &amp; humanities, [[communication]], and [[design]]. The [[history of design]] programme is in collaboration with the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]; there are two double MA/[[Master of Science|MSc]] programmes in [[design engineering]] with [[Imperial College London]], one of which also includes periods of study at [[Keio University]] in Tokyo and at the [[Pratt Institute]] in New York.{{r|rca2}}

==Rankings==
In the [[Research Assessment Exercise]] of December 2008, 40% of the research output of the school received the highest (4* or "world-leading") assessment, the third-highest rating in the art and design subject area; over all subject areas only about fifty institutions received a higher rating.{{r|rae}}

In April 2011 the RCA was ranked first on a list of UK graduate art schools compiled by ''[[Modern Painters (magazine)|Modern Painters]]'' magazine from a survey of professionals in the art world.{{r|city}}

In August 2015 it was ranked first on a list of master's courses in fashion by Business of Fashion, a fashion website.{{r|guard2|bof}}

In 2015 the RCA placed first in the art and design subject area in the [[QS World University Rankings]] published by [[Quacquarelli Symonds]]. In 2016 and 2017 it held onto the position, increasing its overall score from 96.0/100 to 98.4/100.{{r|guard|qs}}

'''''Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám''''' is the title that [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]] gave to his 1859 translation from [[Farsi]] to English of a selection of [[quatrain]]s (''{{lang|ar-Latn|[[ruba'i|rubāʿiyāt]]}}'') attributed to [[Omar Khayyam]]  (1048–1131), dubbed "the Astronomer-Poet of Persia".

FitzGerald's work at first was unsuccessful commercially. But it was popularised from 1861 onward by [[Whitley Stokes]], and the work came to be greatly admired by the [[Pre-Raphaelites]] in England. In  1872 FitzGerald had a third edition printed, which increased interest in the work in the United States of America. By the 1880s, the book was extremely well known throughout the English-speaking world, to the extent that numerous "Omar Khayyam Clubs" were formed and there was a "fin de siècle cult of the Rubaiyat".&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Yohannan, ''Persian Poetry in England and America'', 1977., p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;
FitzGerald's work has been published in several hundred editions, and it has inspired similar translation efforts in English and in many other languages.

The authenticity of the poetry attributed to Omar Khayyam is highly uncertain. Omar was famous during his lifetime not as a poet but as an astronomer and mathematician. The earliest reference to his having written poetry is found in his biography by [[Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani|al-Isfahani]], written 43 years after his death. This view is reinforced by other medieval historians such as [[Shahrazuri]] (1201) and [[Al-Qifti]] (1255). Parts of the ''Rubaiyat'' appear as incidental quotations from Omar in early works of biography and in anthologies. These include works of [[Fakhr al-Din Razi|Razi]] (ca. 1160-1210), [[Najm al-Din Razi|Daya]] (1230), [[Ata-Malik Juvayni|Juvayni]] (ca. 1226-1283), and Jajarmi (1340).&lt;ref name="Wine of Wisdom"&gt;Aminrazavi, Mehdi: ''The Wine of Wisdom''. Oneworld 2005, {{ISBN|1-85168-355-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|92}}&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;Edward Denison Ross, "Omar Khayyam", ''Bulletin of the School Of Oriental Studies'', London Institution (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|434}} Also, five quatrains assigned to Khayyam in somewhat later sources appear in Zahiri Samarqandi's ''[[Sindbad-Nameh]]'' (before 1160) without attribution.&lt;ref name="Dashti"&gt;Ali Dashti (translated by L. P. Elwell-Sutton), ''In Search of Omar Khayyam'', Routledge Library Editions: Iran (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}}

The number of quatrains attributed to him in more recent collections varies from about 1,200 (according to [[Saeed Nafisi]]) to more than 2,000. Skeptical scholars point out that the entire tradition may be [[pseudepigraphic]].&lt;ref name="Dashti" /&gt;{{rp|11}}
The extant manuscripts containing collections attributed to Omar are dated much too late to enable a reconstruction of a body of authentic verses. 

In the 1930s, Iranian scholars, notably [[Mohammad-Ali Foroughi]], attempted to reconstruct a core of authentic verses from scattered quotes by authors of the 13th and 14th centuries, ignoring the younger manuscript tradition. After World War II, reconstruction efforts were significantly delayed by two clever forgeries. De Blois (2004) is pessimistic, suggesting that contemporary scholarship has not advanced beyond the situation of the 1930s, when [[Hans Heinrich Schaeder]] commented that the name of Omar Khayyam "is to be struck out from the history of Persian literature".&lt;ref&gt;Francois De Blois, ''Persian Literature - A Bio-Bibliographical Survey: Poetry of the Pre-Mongol Period'' (2004), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=2e55wuzPc3IC&amp;pg=PA307 p. 307].&lt;/ref&gt;

A feature of the more recent collections is the lack of linguistic homogeneity and continuity of ideas. [[Sadegh Hedayat]] commented that "if a man had lived for a hundred years and had changed his religion, philosophy, and beliefs twice a day, he could scarcely have given expression to such a range of ideas".&lt;ref name="Dashti"/&gt;{{rp|34}} Hedayat's final verdict was that 14 quatrains could be attributed to Khayyam with certainty.&lt;ref name="Sadeq Hedayat's Learning"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bashiri|first1=Iraj|title=Sadeq Hedayat's Learning|url=http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Fiction/Learning.html|website=Blind Owl|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various tests have been employed to reduce the quatrains attributable to Omar to about 100.&lt;ref name="Ross" /&gt;{{rp|434}} Arthur Christensen states that "of more than 1,200 ruba'is known to be ascribed to Omar, only 121 could be regarded as reasonably authentic".&lt;ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" /&gt;{{rp|663}} Foroughi accepts 178 quatrains as authentic, while [[Ali Dashti]] accepts 36 of them.&lt;ref name="Ross" /&gt;{{rp|96}}

FitzGerald's source were transcripts sent to him in 1856&amp;ndash;1857 by his friend and teacher [[Edward B. Cowell]] of two manuscripts, a Bodleian manuscript with 158 quatrains,&lt;ref&gt;MS. Ouseley 140, copied in 1460 in [[Shiraz]], Persia, 47 folia. This is the oldest securely dated manuscript of 
Omar Khayyam's poetry. It belonged to [[William Ouseley]] (1767-1842) and was purchased by the Bodleian Library in 1844.&lt;/ref&gt;
and a "Calcutta manuscript". 

FitzGerald completed his first draft in 1857 and sent it to ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'' in January 1858.
He made a revised draft in January 1859, of which he privately printed 250 copies. This first edition became extremely sought-after by the 1890s, when "more than two million copies ha[d] been sold in two hundred editions".&lt;ref&gt;Preface to a [https://books.google.ch/books?id=NAtFAQAAIAAJ  facsimile of the first edition] (no year [c. 1900], "from the fine copy owned by Charles Dana Burrage" [1857-1926]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skepticism vs. Sufism debate==
The extreme popularity of FitzGerald's work led to a prolonged debate on the correct interpretation of the philosophy behind the poems. FitzGerald emphasized the religious skepticism he found in Omar Khayyam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Dick|title=FitzGerald, Edward|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/fitzgerald-|website=Encyclopædia Iranica|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his preface to the ''Rubáiyát'', he describes Omar's philosophy as [[Epicurean]] and claims that Omar was "hated and dreaded by the Sufis, whose practice he ridiculed  and whose faith amounts to little more than his own, when stripped of the Mysticism and formal recognition of Islamism under which Omar would not hide."&lt;ref&gt;FitzGerald, E. (2010). ''Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'' (p. 12). Champaign, Ill.: Project Gutenberg&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Nelson Frye]] also emphasizes that Khayyam was despised by a number of prominent contemporary Sufis. These include figures such as [[Shams Tabrizi]], [[Najm al-Din Razi|Najm al-Din Daya]], [[Al-Ghazali]], and [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]], who "viewed Khayyam not as a fellow-mystic, but a free-thinking scientist".&lt;ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran"&gt;''The Cambridge History of Iran'', Volume 4. Cambridge University Press (1975): Richard Nelson Frye&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|663–664}} The skeptic interpretation is supported by the medieval historian [[Al-Qifti]] (ca. 1172–1248), who in his ''The History of Learned Men'' reports that Omar's poems were only outwardly in the Sufi style, but were written with an anti-religious agenda. He also mentions that Khayyam was indicted for impiety and went on a [[hajj|pilgrimage]] to avoid punishment.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Sufis understood his poems outwardly and considered them to be part of their mystical tradition. In their sessions and gatherings, Khayyam's poems became the subject of conversation and discussion. His poems, however, are inwardly like snakes who bite the sharia [Islamic law] and are chains and handcuffs placed on religion. Once the people of his time had a taste of his faith, his secrets were revealed. Khayyam was frightened for his life, withdrew from writing, speaking and such like and traveled to [[Mecca]]. Once he arrived in [[Baghdad]], members of a Sufi tradition and believers in primary sciences came to him and courted him. He did not accept them and after performing the pilgrimage returned to his native land, kept his secrets to himself and propagated worshiping and following the people of faith." cited after Aminrazavi (2007){{page needed|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics of FitzGerald, on the other hand, have accused the translator of misrepresenting the mysticism of Sufi poetry by an overly literal interpretation. Thus, the view of Omar Khayyam as a Sufi was defended by Bjerregaard (1915).&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The writings of Omar Khayyam are good specimens of [[Sufism]], but are not valued in the West as they ought to be, and the mass of English-speaking people know him only through the poems of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]]. It is unfortunate because Fitzgerald is not faithful to his master and model, and at times he lays words upon the tongue of the Sufi which are blasphemous. Such outrageous language is that of the eighty-first quatrain for instance. Fitzgerald is doubly guilty because he was more of a Sufi than he was willing to admit." C. H. A. Bjerregaard, ''Sufism: Omar Khayyam and E. Fitzgerald'', The Sufi Publishing Society (1915), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Dougan (1991) likewise says that attributing [[hedonism]] to Omar is due to the failings of FitzGerald's translation, arguing that the poetry is to be understood as "deeply esoteric".&lt;ref&gt;"Every line of the Rubaiyat has more meaning than almost anything you could read in Sufi literature". Abdullah Dougan, [http://www.gnosticpress.co.nz/ ''Who is the Potter?''], Gnostic Press 1991 {{ISBN|0-473-01064-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Idries Shah]] (1999) similarly says that FitzGerald misunderstood Omar's poetry.&lt;ref&gt;"FitzGerald himself was confused about Omar. Sometimes he thought that he was a Sufi, sometimes not." Idries Shah, ''The Sufis'', Octagon Press (1999), pp. 165-166&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sufi interpretation is the view of a minority of scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aminrazavi|first1=Mehdi|title=Umar Khayyam|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/umar-khayyam/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Beveridge]] states that "the Sufis have unaccountably pressed this writer [Khayyam] into their service; they explain away some of his blasphemies by forced interpretations, and others they represent as innocent freedoms and reproaches".&lt;ref&gt;Beveridge, H. (1905). XVIII. "Omar Khayyam". ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'', 37(3), 521-526.&lt;/ref&gt; Aminrazavi (2007) states that "Sufi interpretation of Khayyam is possible only by reading into his Rubaiyat extensively and by stretching the content to fit the classical Sufi doctrine".&lt;ref name="Wine of Wisdom" /&gt;{{rp|128}}

FitzGerald's "skepticist" reading of the poetry is still defended by modern scholars. Sadegh Hedayat (''[[The Blind Owl]]'' 1936) was the most notable modern proponent of Khayyam's philosophy as agnostic skepticism. In his introductory essay to his second edition of the ''Quatrains of the Philosopher Omar Khayyam'' (1922), Hedayat states that "while Khayyam believes in the transmutation and transformation of the human body, he does not believe in a separate soul; if we are lucky, our bodily particles would be used in the making of a jug of wine".&lt;ref&gt;Katouzian, H. (1991). Sadeq Hedayat: ''The life and literature of an Iranian writer'' (p. 138). London: I.B. Tauris&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes that "religion has proved incapable of surmounting his inherent fears; thus Khayyam finds himself alone and insecure in a universe about which his knowledge is nil". In his later work (''Khayyam's Quatrains'', 1935), Hedayat further maintains that Khayyam's usage of Sufic terminology such as "wine" is literal, and that  "Khayyam took refuge in wine to ward off bitterness and to blunt the cutting edge of his thoughts."&lt;ref name="Sadeq Hedayat's Learning" /&gt;

FitzGerald's text was published in five editions, with substantial revisions:
* 1st edition – 1859 [75 quatrains]
* 2nd edition – 1868 [110 quatrains]
* 3rd edition – 1872 [101 quatrains]
**1878, "first American edition", reprint of the 3rd ed.
* 4th edition – 1879 [101 quatrains]
* 5th edition – 1889 [101 quatrains]

Of the five editions published, four were published under the authorial control of FitzGerald. The fifth edition, which contained only minor changes from the fourth, was edited posthumously after his death on the basis of manuscript revisions FitzGerald had left.

Numerous later editions were published after 1889, notably an edition with illustrations by [[Willy Pogany]], first published in 1909 (George G. Harrap, London). It was issued in numerous revised editions.This edition combined FitzGerald's texts of the 1st and 4th editions and was subtitled "The First and Fourth Renderings in English Verse".

A bibliography of editions compiled in 1929 listed more than 300 separate editions.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose George Potter, ''A Bibliography of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'' (1929).&lt;/ref&gt;  Many more have been published since.&lt;ref&gt;Francois De Blois, ''Persian Literature - A Bio-Bibliographical Survey: Poetry of the Pre-Mongol Period'' (2004), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=2e55wuzPc3IC&amp;pg=PA312 p. 312].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character of translation==
FitzGerald's translation is rhyming and metrical, and rather [[Free translation|free]]. Many of the verses are paraphrased, and some of them cannot be confidently traced to his source material at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|last=Fitzgerald|first=Edward|publisher=Rupa &amp; Co.|year=2007|isbn=81-7167-439-9|location=New Delhi|pages=132|chapter=Note by W. Aldis Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt; FitzGerald described his work as "transmogrification".{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} To a large extent, the ''Rubaiyat'' can be considered original poetry by FitzGerald loosely based on Omar's quatrains rather than a "translation" in the narrow sense.

FitzGerald was open about the liberties he had taken with his source material:
&lt;blockquote&gt;My translation will interest you from its form, and also in many respects in its detail: very un-literal as it is. Many quatrains are mashed together: and something lost, I doubt, of Omar's simplicity, which is so much a virtue in him. (letter to E. B. Cowell, 9/3/58)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I suppose very few People have ever taken such Pains in Translation as I have: though certainly not to be literal. But at all Cost, a Thing must live: with a transfusion of one's own worse Life if one can’t retain the Original's better. Better a live Sparrow than a stuffed Eagle. (letter to E. B. Cowell, 4/27/59)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For comparison, here are two versions of the same quatrain by FitzGerald, from the 1859 and 1889 editions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{| style="vertical-align: top;"" role="presentation"
|Quatrain XI (1859)
&lt;poem&gt;

A Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse—and Thou

And Wilderness is Paradise enow.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|style="padding-left: 2em;"|Quatrain XII (1889)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arabiannights.org/rubaiyat/rubaiyat.php3?display?5??9?0?4?3????1 |title=Arabiannights.org |publisher=Arabiannights.org |date= |accessdate=11 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630085923/http://www.arabiannights.org/rubaiyat/rubaiyat.php3?display%3F5%3F%3F9%3F0%3F4%3F3%3F%3F%3F%3F1 |archive-date=30 June 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread—and Thou

&lt;/poem&gt;
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This quatrain has a close correspondence in two of the quatrains in the [[Bodleian Library]] ms., numbers 149 and 155. In the literal prose translation of 
[[Edward Heron-Allen]] (1898):&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/rubaiyatbodleian00omar#page/266/mode/2up The Ruba'iyat of Omar Khayyam : being a facsimile of the manuscript in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, with a transcript into modern Persian characters.

===English===
Multilingual edition, published in 1955 by [[Tahrir Iran Co.]]/[[Kashani Bros.]]]]

Two English editions by [[Edward Henry Whinfield]] (1836&amp;ndash;1922) consisted of 253 quatrains in 1882 and 500 in 1883. This translation was fully revised and some cases fully translated anew by Ali Salami and published by Mehrandish Books.

Whinfield's translation is, if possible, even more free than FitzGerald's; Quatrain 84 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above) reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
In the sweet spring a grassy bank I sought
And thither wine and a fair [[Houri]] brought;
And, though the people called me graceless dog,
Gave not to [[Paradise]] another thought!
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Leslie Garner published an English translation of 152 quatrains in 1888. His was also a free, rhyming translation.
Quatrain I. 20 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Yes, Loved One, when the Laughing Spring is blowing,
With Thee beside me and the Cup o’erflowing,
I pass the day upon this Waving Meadow,
And dream the while, no thought on Heaven bestowing.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Justin Huntly McCarthy]] (1859–1936) (Member of Parliament for [[Newry (UK Parliament constituency)|Newry]]) published prose translations of 466 quatrains in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Omar Khayyam, ''Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'', translated by [[Justin Huntly McCarthy]] MP. [London] : D. Nutt, 1889. (Source: [http://library.catalogue.tcd.ie/record=b13332609~S9 Trinity College Dublin Library])&lt;/ref&gt;
Quatrain 177 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
In Spring time I love to sit in the meadow with a paramour
perfect as a Houri and goodly jar of wine, and though
I may be blamed for this, yet hold me lower
than a dog if ever I dream of Paradise.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Richard Le Gallienne]] (1866–1947) produced a verse translation, subtitled "a paraphrase from several literal translations", in 1897. 
In his introductory note to the reader, Le Gallienne cites [[Justin Huntly McCarthy|McCarthy]]'s "charming prose" as the chief influence on his version. Some example quatrains follow:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Look not above, there is no answer there;
Pray not, for no one listens to your prayer;
Near is as near to God as any Far,
And Here is just the same deceit as There.
''(#78, on p. 44)''

And do you think that unto such as you;
A [[maggot]]-minded, starved, fanatic crew:
God gave the secret, and denied it me?—
Well, well, what matters it! Believe that, too.
''(#85, p. 47)''

"Did God set grapes a-growing, do you think,
And at the same time make it sin to drink?
Give thanks to Him who foreordained it thus—
Surely He loves to hear the glasses clink!"
''(#91, p. 48)''
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Edward Heron-Allen]] (1861–1943) published a prose translation in 1898. He also wrote an introduction to an edition of [[Frederick Rolfe]] (Baron Corvo) 's translation into English of Nicolas's French translation.

The English novelist and orientalist [[Jessie Cadell]] (1844–1884) consulted various manuscripts of the Rubaiyat with the intention of producing an authoritative edition. Her translation of 150 quatrains was published posthumously in 1899.&lt;ref name=ODNBCadell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raza|first1=Rosemary Cargill|chapter=Cadell, Jessie Ellen (1844&amp;ndash;1884)|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/4300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur John Arberry|A. J. Arberry]] in 1959 attempted a scholarly edition of Khayyam, based on thirteenth-century manuscripts. However, his manuscripts were subsequently exposed as twentieth-century forgeries.&lt;ref name=TLS&gt;{{cite web

The 1967 translation of the Rubáiyat by [[Robert Graves]] and [[Omar Ali-Shah]], however, created a scandal. The authors claimed it was based on a twelfth-century manuscript located in Afghanistan, where it was allegedly utilized as a Sufi teaching document. But the manuscript was never produced, and British experts in Persian literature were easily able to prove that the translation was in fact based on Edward Heron Allen's analysis of possible sources for FitzGerald's work.&lt;ref name=TLS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aminrazavi, Mehdi: ''The Wine of Wisdom''.

Quatrains 11 and 12 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Should our day's portion be one mancel loaf,
A haunch of [[mutton]] and a gourd of wine
Set for us two alone on the wide plain,
No Sultan's bounty could evoke such joy.

A gourd of red wine and a sheaf of poems —
A bare subsistence, half a loaf, not more —
Supplied us two alone in the free desert:
What Sultan could we envy on his throne?
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[http://oberlin.edu/library/special/bowen.html John Charles Edward Bowen (1909-1989)] was a British poet and translator of Persian poetry. He is best known for his translation of the Rubaiyat, titled ''A New Selection from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.'' Bowen is also credited as being one of the first scholars to question Robert Graves' and Omar Ali-Shah's translation of the Rubaiyat.&lt;ref&gt;http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001005780&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern version of 235 quatrains, claiming to be "as literal an English version of the Persian originals as readability and intelligibility permit", was published in 1979 by [[Peter Avery]] and [[John Heath-Stubbs]]. 
Their edition provides two versions of the thematic quatrain, the first (98) considered by the Persian writer [[Sadeq Hedayat]] to be a spurious attribution.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Then you and I, seated in a deserted spot,
Will have more wealth than a Sultan's realm.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
234.
If chance supplied a loaf of white bread,
Two casks of wine and a leg of mutton,
In the corner of a garden with a tulip-cheeked girl,
There'd be enjoyment no Sultan could outdo.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1988, the Rubaiyat was translated by a Persian for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Azarang|first=Abd-al Hussein|title=Emami, Karim|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/emami-karim-translator-editor|work=Encyclopædia Iranica|publisher=iranicaonline.org|accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karim Emami]]'s translation of the Rubaiyat was published under the title ''The Wine of Nishapour'' in Paris. ''The Wine of Nishapour'' is the collection of Khayyam's poetry by Shahrokh Golestan, including Golestan's pictures in front of each poem.&lt;ref&gt;Emami, Karim. ''Ups and Downs of Translation'', Tehran, 1988, pp. 134-169&lt;/ref&gt;  
Example quatrain 160 (equivalent{{dubious|date=September 2017}} of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his first edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
In spring if a houri-like sweetheart
Gives me a cup of wine on the edge of a green cornfield,
Though to the vulgar this would be blasphemy,
If I mentioned any other Paradise, I'd be worse than a dog.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1991 [[Ahmad Saidi]] (1904–1994) produced an English translation of 165 quatrains grouped into 10 themes. Born and raised in Iran, Saidi went to the United States in 1931 and attended college there. He served as the head of the Persian Publication Desk at the U.S. Office of War Information during World War II, inaugurated the Voice of America to Iran, and prepared an English-[[Persian language|Persian]] military dictionary for the Department of Defense. His quatrains include the original Persian verses for reference alongside his English translations. His focus was to faithfully convey, with less poetic license, Khayyam's original religious, mystical, and historic Persian themes, through the verses as well as his extensive annotations. Two example quatrains follow:

Quatrain 16 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XII in his 5th edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Ah, would there were a loaf of bread as fare,
A joint of lamb, a jug of vintage rare,
And you and I in wilderness encamped—
No Sultan's pleasure could with ours compare.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quatrain 75:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The sphere upon which mortals come and go,
Has no end nor beginning that we know;
And none there is to tell us in plain truth:
Whence do we come and whither do we go.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===German===
[[Adolf Friedrich von Schack]] (1815–1894) published a German translation in 1878.

Quatrain 151 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Gönnt mir, mit dem Liebchen im Gartenrund
Zu weilen bei süßem Rebengetränke,
Und nennt mich schlimmer als einen Hund,
Wenn ferner an's Paradies ich denke!
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Friedrich Martin von Bodenstedt|Friedrich Martinus von Bodenstedt]] (1819–1892) published a German translation in 1881. The translation eventually consisted of 395 quatrains.

Quatrain IX, 59 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Im Frühling mag ich gern im Grüne weilen
Und Einsamkeit mit einer Freundin teilen
Und einem Kruge Wein. Mag man mich schelten:
Ich lasse keinen andern Himmel gelten.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===French===
The first French translation, of 464 quatrains in prose, was made by J. B. Nicolas, chief interpreter at the French embassy in Persia in 1867.

Prose stanza (equivalent of Fitzgerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):

&lt;blockquote lang="fr"&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''Au printemps j’aime à m’asseoir au bord d’une prairie, avec une idole semblable à une houri et une cruche de vin, s’il y en a, et bien que tout cela soit généralement blâmé, je veux être pire qu’un chien si jamais je songe au paradis.''
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The best-known version in French is the free verse edition by Franz Toussaint (1879–1955) published in 1924. This translation consisting of 170 [[quatrains]] was done from the original Persian text, while most of the other French translations were themselves translations of FitzGerald's work. The ''Éditions d'art Henri Piazza'' published the book almost unchanged between 1924 and 1979. Toussaint's translation has served as the basis of subsequent translations into other languages, but Toussaint did not live to witness the influence his translation has had.

Quatrain XXV (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote lang="fr"&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''Au printemps, je vais quelquefois m’asseoir à la lisière d’un champ fleuri. Lorsqu’une belle jeune fille m’apporte une coupe de vin, je ne pense guère à mon salut. Si j’avais cette préoccupation, je vaudrais moins qu’un chien.''
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Russian===
Many [[Russian language|Russian-language]] translations have been undertaken, reflecting the popularity of the ''Rubaiyat'' in [[Russia]] since the late 19th century and the increasingly popular tradition of using it for the purposes of [[bibliomancy]]. The earliest verse translation (by [[Vasily Velichko]]) was published in 1891. The version by Osip Rumer published in 1914 is a translation of FitzGerald's version. Rumer later published a version of 304 rubaiyat translated directly from Persian. A lot of poetic translations (some based on verbatim translations into prose by others) were also written by [[German Plisetsky]], [[Konstantin Bal'mont]], Ts. Banu, I. Tkhorzhevsky, L. Pen'kovsky, and others.

==Influence==

FitzGerald rendered Omar's name as "Omar the Tentmaker",{{dubious|date=September 2017}}&lt;!--apparently not in FitzGerald's text--&gt; and this name resonated in English-speaking popular culture for a while. Thus, [[Nathan Haskell Dole]] published a novel called ''Omar, the Tentmaker: A Romance of Old Persia'' in 1898. ''Omar the Tentmaker of Naishapur'' is a historical novel by John Smith Clarke, published in 1910. 
"Omar the Tentmaker" is a 1914 play in an oriental setting by [[Richard Walton Tully]], adapted as a [[Omar the Tentmaker (film)|silent film]] in 1922.
US General [[Omar Bradley]] was given the nickname "Omar the Tent-Maker" in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey D. Lavoie, ''
The Private Life of General Omar N. Bradley'' (2015), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and the name has been recorded as a slang expression for "[[penis]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kimmel, Christine Milrod, Amanda Kennedy,  ''Cultural Encyclopedia of the Penis'' (2014), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;
FitzGerald's translations also reintroduced Khayyam to  Iranians, "who had long ignored the Neishapouri poet".&lt;ref name="Molavi110"&gt;Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran'', Norton, (2005), p. 110f.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===

{{trivia|date=September 2017}}
* The title of [[Rex Stout]]'s [[Nero Wolfe]] novel ''[[Some Buried Caesar]]'' comes from one of the Tentmaker's quatrains (FitzGerald's XVIII), for example.
* [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s drama ''[[Ah, Wilderness!]]'' derives its title from the first quoted quatrain above.
* [[Agatha Christie]] used ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' as a story title, as did [[Stephen King]]. See also ''[[And Having Writ…]]''.
* [[Lan Wright]] used ''[[Dawn's Left Hand]]'' as the title of a science fiction story serialized in ''[[New Worlds Science Fiction]]'' (January–March 1963).
* The title of [[Allen Drury]]'s science fiction novel ''[[The Throne of Saturn (novel)|The Throne of Saturn]]'' comes from a quatrain which appears as the book's [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]].

Equally noteworthy are these works likewise influenced:
* The satirist and short story writer Hector Hugh Munro took his pen name of '[[Saki]]' from Edward FitzGerald's translation of the Rubaiyat.
* The American author [[O. Henry]] humorously referred to a book by "Homer KM" with the character "Ruby Ott" in his short story "The Handbook of Hymen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.literaturecollection.com/a/o_henry/66/ |title=The Handbook of Hymen by O. Henry |publisher=Literaturecollection.com |date= |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411200856/http://www.literaturecollection.com/a/o_henry/66/ |archivedate=11 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; " O. Henry also quoted a quatrain from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam in "The Rubaiyat of a Scotch Highball."
* [[Oliver Herford]] released a parody of the Rubaiyat called "The Rubaiyat of a Persian Kitten" in 1904, which is notable for its charming illustrations of the kitten in question on his philosophical adventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldfashionedamericanhumor.com/the-rubaiyat-of-a-persian-kitten.html |title=Old Fashioned American Humor |publisher=Old Fashioned American Humor |date=6 March 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The American horror author [[H P Lovecraft]] created an Arab poet [[Abdul Alhazred]] to whom was attributed a couplet:
:::That is not dead which can eternal lie
:::And with strange aeons even death may die.
:Lovecraft was obsessed with the [[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]] and had no doubt read the Fitzgerald translation - the couplet follows Fitzgerald's [[Meter (poetry)|metre]] and rhyme pattern for the first half of a Khayyam quatrain.
* The artist/illustrator [[Edmund Dulac]] produced some much-beloved illustrations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldfineart.com/albums/rubaiyat-of-omar-khayyam-illustrated-by-edmund-dulac/pages/1/ |title=oldfineart.com |publisher=oldfineart.com |date= |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005104159/http://www.oldfineart.com/albums/rubaiyat-of-omar-khayyam-illustrated-by-edmund-dulac/pages/1/ |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the Rubaiyat, 1909.
* The play ''[[The Shadow of a Gunman]]'' (1923) by [[Seán O'Casey]] contains a reference to the ''Rubaiyat'' as the character Donal Davoren quotes "grasp this sorry scheme of things entire, and mould life nearer to the heart's desire."
* The Argentinian writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] discusses ''The Rubaiyat'' and its history in an essay, "The Enigma of Edward FitzGerald" ("El enigma de Edward FitzGerald") in his book "Other Inquisitions" ("Otras Inquisiciones", 1952). He also references it in some of his poems, including "Rubaiyat" in "The Praise of the Shadow" ("Elogio de la Sombra", 1969), and "Chess" ("Ajedrez") in "The Maker" ("El Hacedor", 1960). Borges' father [[Jorge Guillermo Borges]] was the author of a Spanish translation of the FitzGerald version of The Rubaiyat.
* Science fiction author [[Paul Marlowe]]'s story "Resurrection and Life" featured a character who could only communicate using lines from the Rubaiyat.
* Science fiction author [[Isaac Asimov]] quotes ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' in his time-travel novel ''[[The End of Eternity]]''  when a character discusses whether history could be changed.
* [[Charles M. Schulz|Charles Schultz]] wrote a strip in which Lucy reads the ''[[Jug of Wine]]'' passage, and Linus asks "No blanket?".
* [[Wendy Cope]]'s poem "Strugnell's Rubiyat" is a close parody of the FitzGerald translation, relocated to modern day [[Tulse Hill]].
* One of the title pages of ''[[Principia Discordia]]'' (1965), a co-author of which went by the pen-name [[Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst]], features its own spin on the quatrain most quoted above:
::: A jug of wine,
::: A leg of lamb
:::: And thou!
::: Beside me,
:::: Whistling in
::::: the darkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/5.php |title=Principia Discordia, the book of Chaos, Discord and Confusion |publisher=Principiadiscordia.com |date= |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Lebanese writer [[Amin Maalouf]] based his novel ''[[Samarkand (novel)|Samarkand]]'' (1988) on the life of [[Omar Khayyam]], and the creation of the Rubaiyat. It details the [[Hashshashin|Assassin]] sect as well, and includes a fictional telling of how the (non-existent) original manuscript came to be on the ''[[RMS Titanic]]''.
* In the opening chapter of his book ''[[God is Not Great]]'' (2007), [[Christopher Hitchens]] quotes from [[Richard Le Gallienne]]'s translation of Khayyam's famous quatrain:
:::And do you think that unto such as you
:::A maggot-minded, starved, fanatic crew
:::God gave the secret, and denied it me?
:::Well, well--what matters it? Believe that, too!
* The title of [[Daphne du Maurier]]'s memoir ''Myself when Young'' is a quote from quatrain 27 of Fitzgerald's translation:
:::Myself when young did eagerly frequent
:::Doctor and Saint, and heard great Argument
:::About it and about: but evermore
:::Came out by the same Door as in I went.

===Cinema===
* Filmmaker [[D.W. Griffith]] planned a film based on the poems as a follow-up to ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' in 1916. It was to star [[Miriam Cooper]], but when she left the Griffith company the plans were dropped;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dark Lady of the Silents |last=Cooper |first=Miriam |year=1973 |publisher=Bobbs Merrill |isbn=0672517256 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; he would ultimately film ''[[Broken Blossoms]]'' instead.
* A canto was quoted and used as an underlying theme of the 1945 screen adaptation of ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'': "I sent my soul through the invisible, some letters of that after-life to spell, and by and by my soul did return, and answered, 'I myself am Heaven and Hell.'"
* The Rubaiyat was quoted in the 1946 [[King Vidor]] Western film ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'', which starred [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Jennifer Jones]]: "Oh threats of hell and hopes of paradise! One thing at least is certain: This life flies. One thing is certain and the rest is Lies; The Flower that once is blown for ever dies."
* The 1951 film ''[[Pandora and the Flying Dutchman]]'', starring [[James Mason]] and [[Ava Gardner]], opens with an illuminated manuscript of the quatrain beginning "The moving finger writes...".
* In the film ''[[The Music Man (1962 film)|The Music Man]]'' (based on the 1957 [[The Music Man|musical]]), town librarian Marian Paroo draws down the wrath of the mayor's wife for encouraging the woman's daughter to read a book of "dirty Persian poetry." Summarizing what she calls the "Ruby Hat of Omar Kayayayayay...I am ''appalled!!"'', the mayor's wife paraphrases FitzGerald's Quatrain XII from his 5th edition: "People lying out in the woods eating sandwiches, and drinking directly out of jugs with innocent young girls."
* The film ''[[Omar Khayyam (film)|Omar Khayyam]]'', also known as ''The Loves Of Omar Khayyam'', was released in 1957 by Paramount Pictures and includes excerpts from the Rubaiyat.
* In ''[[Back to the Future]]'' the character Lorraine Baines, played by [[Lea Thompson]], is holding a copy of the book in 1955 at the high school when her son Marty McFly is trying to introduce her to his father.
* The Rubaiyat was quoted in the film ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'' (1995) around 11 minutes in.
* In [[Adrian Lyne]]'s ''[[Unfaithful (2002 film)|Unfaithful]]'' a copy of the text in French is quoted in English: "Drink wine, this is life eternal //This, all that youth will give to you//It is the season for wine, roses//And drunken friends//Be happy for this moment//This moment is your life." The book is a gift given flirtatiously to [[Diane Lane]]'s character by [[Olivier Martinez]] who plays rare book dealer Paul Martel in the film.

===Music===
* The British composer [[Granville Bantock]] produced a choral setting of FitzGerald's translation 1906&amp;ndash;1909.
* Using FitzGerald's translation, the Armenian-American composer [[Alan Hovhaness]] set a dozen of the quatrains to music. This work, ''The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'', Op. 308, calls for narrator, orchestra, and solo [[accordion]].
* The Rubaiyat have also influenced Arabic music. In 1950 the Egyptian singer [[Umm Kulthum]] recorded a song entitled "Rubaiyat Al-Khayyam."
* The [[Comedian Harmonists]] in "[[Wochenend und Sonnenschein]]".
* [[Woody Guthrie]] recorded an excerpt of the Rubaiyat set to music that was released on ''[[Hard Travelin' (The Asch Recordings Vol. 3)]]''.
* [[The Human Instinct]]'s album ''[[Pins In It]]'' (1971) opens with a track called "Pinzinet," the lyrics of which are based on the Rubaiyat.
* [[Elektra Records]] released a compilation album named ''[[Rubáiyát: Elektra's 40th Anniversary|Rubáiyát]]'' in 1990 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Elektra Records record label.
* [[Coldcut]] produced an album with a song called "Rubaiyat" on their album ''Let us Play!'' (1997).

The book remains lost at the bottom of the Atlantic to this day.

[[File:Van Gogh - Fischerboote am Strand von Saintes-Maries1.jpeg|thumb|300px|''Fishing Boats on the Beach at Saintes-Maries'', June 1888, [[Van Gogh Museum]], Amsterdam, Netherlands (F413)]]

'''''Saintes-Maries''''' is the subject of a series of paintings that [[Vincent van Gogh]] made in 1888.  When Van Gogh lived in Arles, he took a trip to [[Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer]] on the [[Mediterranean sea]], where he made several paintings of the seascape and town.

==Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer==
In June 1888, Van Gogh took a 30-mile stagecoach trip from Arles to the sea-side fishing village of [[Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer]] on the coast of the [[Mediterranean sea]].  Van Gogh's week-long trip was taken to recover from his health problems and make some seaside paintings and drawings.  At that time, Saintes-Maries was a small fishing village with under a hundred homes.&lt;ref name=Beaujean&gt;Beaujean, 48-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seaside==
In just a few days, he made two paintings of the sea, one of the village and nine drawings.  One of the paintings was Van Gogh Museum's ''Fishing Boats on the Beach at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer'' (F413), which he described to his brother, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]]: "I made the drawing of the boats when I left very early in the morning, and I am now working on a painting based on it, a size 30 canvas with more sea and sky on the right. It was before the boats hastened out; I had watched them every morning, but as they leave very early I didn't have time to paint them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2659&amp;collection=623&amp;lang=en |title=Fishing Boats on the Beach at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, 1888  |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the work on the painting was finished in the studio, such as capturing the light in the sand, sea and sky.&lt;ref name=Beaujean/&gt;

Another seascape Van Gogh made was ''The Sea at Les Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer'' (F415) in which he sought to capture light's effect on the sea.  He wrote that the "Mediterranean Sea is a mackerel color: in other words, changeable – you do not always know whether it is green or purple, you do not always know if it is blue, as the next moment the ever-changing sheen has assumed a pink or a gray tint."  The setting includes fishing boats returning to the village. To emphasize contrast to the color green in the painting, Van Gogh signs his name in large bright red letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2679&amp;collection=623&amp;lang=en |title=The Sea at Les Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, 1888   |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fishing Boats at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer'' (F1433) is one of Van Gogh's reed pen drawings of Saint-Maries which he based on his painting ''The Sea at Les Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer'' (F415).  The fluid movements of Van Gogh's pen bring an energy to the drawing, not intended to be a mimetic copy.  Both his choice of the reed pen and the "placement of tiered-patterned strokes" reflect the influence of Japanese [[woodcut print|prints]].  He brings life to the painting through technique.  The [[Pointillism|Pointillist]] dotted sky accentuates the clouds.  Whitecaps are evoked by the vertical lines and horizontal lines portray the calmer sea in the distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slam.org/Collections/ |title=Fishing Boats at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, 1888 |year=2011 |work=Collection |publisher=St. Louis Museum of Art |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Seascape at Saintes-Maries (Fishing Boats at Sea)'' was painted six years after Van Gogh wrote that he wished to paint a seaside painting of sand, sea and sky.  In this painting the combination of a high horizon and boats close to the top edge of the frame, draw the audience in to the choppy sea in the foreground and center of the picture.  He also made three drawings of this composition.&lt;ref name=Beaujean/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Town==
In the painting ''View of Saintes-Maries'' (F416), Van Gogh painted rows of what is likely lavender from the foreground to the town of Saintes-Maries in the center of the frame, thereby drawing the viewer into the painting.  A wall encloses the town in which a large church becomes the focal point.  The painting takes upon a three-dimensional appearance, starting with relief-like layers of blue paint in the sky.  Finer brushstrokes were used on the field and town buildings.&lt;ref name=Beaujean/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6831">'''Scene and sequel''' are two types of written passages used by authors to advance the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] of a [[narrative|story]]. ''Scenes'' propel a story forward as the [[character (arts)|character]] attempts to achieve a goal.&lt;ref name="Swain 84-85"&gt;Swain, p. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Sequels'' provide an opportunity for the character to react to the scene, analyze the new situation, and decide upon the next course of action.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 96-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scene==
The concept of a scene in written [[fiction]] has evolved over many years. [[Dwight V. Swain]], in ''Techniques of the Selling Writer'' (1965) defined a ''scene'' as a unit of [[Conflict (narrative)|conflict]], an account of an effort to attain a goal despite opposition. According to Swain, the functions of a scene are to provide interest and to move the story forward. The structure of a scene, as described by Swain, is (1) goal, (2) conflict, (3) disaster.&lt;ref name="Swain 84-85"/&gt;

In ''The Art of Fiction'' (1983), John Gardner described a scene as having an unbroken flow of action without a lapse of time or leap from one setting to another.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the years, other authors have attempted to improve on the definition of ''scene'', and to explain its use and structure.&lt;ref&gt;Bickham, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obstfeld, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, p. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
In addition to defining a scene, Swain described a ''sequel'' as a unit of transition that links two scenes, adding that a sequel functions to translate disaster into goal, telescope reality, and control tempo. Swain also described the structure of a sequel as (1) reaction, (2) [[dilemma]], and (3) decision.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 96, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have attempted to improve on the definition of a ''sequel'' and to explain its use and structure.&lt;ref&gt;Bickham, p. 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrell, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proactive vs. reactive==
Rather than viewing scenes and sequels as distinct types of passages, some authors express the concept as two types of scenes: proactive and reactive.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 61, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingermanson and Economy, p. 168, 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scenes and sequels==
Swain defined, described, and explained scene and sequel as if they were separate entities, but then he explained that they must complement each other, linking together smoothly into a story. He went on to observe that

*An author controls [[Pace (narrative)|pacing]] by the way he proportions scene to sequel.
*The peaks and valleys in a diagram of a story correspond to scenes and sequels.
*Flexibility is important, versus a mechanical approach.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 113-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural units of fiction== 
The ''structural units of [[fiction writing]]'' comprise all fiction.&lt;ref name="Klaassen 3"&gt;Klaassen, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*The smallest units of writing are [[word]]s, [[phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, and [[paragraph]]s.
*Two or more paragraphs with some common purpose are referred to as ''passages'' or ''segments'' of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Scenes and sequels are specialized passages of writing. A ''scene'' is a passage of writing in which the character attempts to achieve a goal. A ''sequel'' is a passage of writing in which the character reacts reflectively to the previous scene.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[chapter (books)|chapter]] is a segment of writing delineated by a form of punctuation called a ''chapter break''.&lt;ref&gt;Lukeman, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Prologue]]'' and ''[[epilogue]]'' are two specialized types of chapters.&lt;ref name="Klaassen 3"/&gt;
*A chapter may include one or more ''sections'', passages separated by another form of punctuation called a ''section break''.&lt;ref&gt;Lukeman, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some [[novel]]s, especially long ones, may be further divided into ''books'' or ''parts'', each including two or more chapters.

==Types of passages==
Passages of writing may be classified into four groups: (1) scenes, (2) sequels, (3) passages that are ''neither'' scenes nor sequels, and (4) passages that include elements of ''both'' scenes and sequels. Examples of passages that are neither scenes nor sequels include ''fragments''&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;  of scenes or sequels and passages of [[narration]], [[description]], or [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]]. An example of a passage that includes elements of both scenes and sequels is the ''problem-solving passage'', common in [[mystery fiction|mystery]] and [[detective stories]].&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of scenes==
Scenes may be classified by their position within the story (such as an opening scene or a [[climax (narrative)|climax]] scene). A scene may be classified by the [[fiction-writing mode]] that dominates its presentation (as in an [[action fiction|action]] scene or a [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]] scene). Some scenes have specialized roles (such as [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scenes and [[flashforward]] scenes).&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Seances''''' is a 2016 interactive project by filmmaker and installation artist [[Guy Maddin]], co-creators Evan and Galen Johnson, and the [[National Film Board of Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;http://onf-nfb.gc.ca/en/press-room/press-releases-media-kits/?idpres=21002&lt;/ref&gt; combining Maddin's recreations of [[lost film]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s with an algorithmic film generator that allows for multiple storytelling permutations.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/seances-guy-maddins-film-generator-is-an-endless-cinematic-experience/article29825665/|title=Seances: Guy Maddin’s film generator is an endless cinematic experience|last=Green|first=Robert-Everett|date=2 May 2016|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seances Guy Maddin"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phi-centre.com/en/events/id/Seances|title=Seances Guy Maddin|date=2013|publisher=''PHI''|accessdate=2014-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maddin began the project in 2012 in Paris, France, shooting footage for 18 films at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] (this installation was titled ''Spiritismes'', the French word for “seances,” leading to press confusion about the project title)&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jonathanball.com/guy-maddin-on-the-forbidden-room-and-writing-melodrama/|title=Guy Maddin on The Forbidden Room and Writing Melodrama |date=2014-12-05|last=ball|first=Jonathan|work=Dr. Jonathan Ball: Writing the Wrong Way (interview with Guy Maddin)|accessdate=2014-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued shooting footage for an additional 12 films at the Phi Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.&lt;ref name="Seances Guy Maddin"/&gt; The Paris and Montreal shoots each took three weeks, with Maddin completing one short film of approximately 15-20 minutes each day.&lt;ref name=Bernstein&gt;{{cite news|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/97888-guy-maddin-on-the-saddest-music-in-the-world-and-his-interactive-seances/#.VxfCKPkrLq4|title=Guy Maddin on The Saddest Music in The World and His Interactive Seances (interview)|last=Bernstein|first=Paula|date=29 March 2016|work=Filmmaker Magazine|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shoots were also presented as art installation projects, during which Maddin, along with the cast and crew, held a “séance” during which Maddin "invite[d] the spirit of a lost photoplay to possess them."&lt;ref name="MaddinGuy"/&gt;

==Production history==

''Seances'' grew out of Maddin’s ''Hauntings'' project. Noah Cowan, a former director of the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], told Maddin “he didn’t think it was possible to make art on the Internet,” which “reminded [Maddin] of what people said about cinema when it was starting out, when the moviolas and kinetoscopes were considered artless novelties.”&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;

Maddin began with the idea of “shooting adaptations of lost films” and originally conceived the project as making “title-for-title remakes of specific lost films” but altered this plan in favour of producing original material as the project developed. Maddin completed 11 films to show as installation loops for Noah Cowan and the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]’s Bell Lightbox theatre for this 2010 ''Hauntings'' project.&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;

At the [[SXSW]] 2012 festival, Maddin announced that he had begun production on the ''Seances'' project, for which he would shoot one hundred short films within a hundred-day span, at locations in Canada, France, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/sxsw-12-interview-guy-maddin-talks-making-100-short-films-in-100-days-in-four-countries-with-current-project-spiritismes|title=SXSW '12 Interview: Guy Maddin Talks Making 100 Short Films In 100 Days In Four Countries With Current Project 'Spiritismes'|date=2012-03-16|work=Interview|publisher=''The Playlist''|accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Maddin abandoned this approach to the project to focus more fully on original script creation, partnering with writers [[Evan Johnson]] and [[Robert Kotyk]], with additional writing by Maddin’s wife [[Kim Morgan]] and American poet [[John Ashbery]].&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;

Maddin and Johnson also co-directed and shot, concurrently, a feature film titled ''[[The Forbidden Room (2015 film)|The Forbidden Room]]'', with the same writers. Although often misreported as the same project, ''The Forbidden Room'' “is a feature film with its own separate story and stars” while “''Seances'' will be an interactive Internet project.”&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt; Many of the actors in ''Seances'' also appear in ''The Forbidden Room''.

==Algorithmic storytelling==
Each viewer sees a unique film. Software designed by Halifax-based Nickel Media utilizes an [[algorithmic art|algorithm]] to create the narrative from scenes shot by Maddin, to form a 10- to 13-minute film, each with a unique title.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; The number of films ensures "hundreds of billions of unique permutations."&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;&lt;ref name="MaddinGuy" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Woods&gt;{{cite news|last=Woods|first=Allan|title=Guy Maddin’s performance art installation Seances begins filming in Montreal|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/visualarts/2013/07/04/guy_maddins_performance_art_installation_seances_begins_filming_in_montreal.html|accessdate=10 July 2013|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RomneyJonathan"&gt;Romney, Jonathan. "A Canadian in Paris." ''Sight &amp; Sound'' (May 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch==
''Seances'' was launched on April 14, online and as part of [[Tribeca Film Festival]]’s Storyscapes program.&lt;ref name=Bernstein/&gt; 

==List of "resurrected" films==
In addition to reimagining lost films, Maddin is also "resurrecting" projects that were planned but never filmed. Maddin has stated that he will not be parodying or otherwise mimicking the approach of the directors whose films he is reenvisioning, but rather tried to capture the imagined "spirits of the films, rather than of their directors."&lt;ref name="RomneyJonathan" /&gt; Films will not be shown in their entirety, but rather, offered as fragments in order to be recombined online.&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;

'''Seljuq pottery''' was the [[pottery]] of the [[Seljuq Empire]]. With the end of the Seljuq Empire in the 14th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] took over some of the traditions of the Seljuqs, especially in the early stages of [[İznik pottery]].&lt;ref name="IAM"&gt;[[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]] permanent exhibit&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiles are known from the Seljuq period, which use the ''Minai'' technique. The technique involved the use of seven colors, with blue, green and turquoise applied on an underglaze and fired. Other colors such as yellow, red, white, black and sometimes [[Gilding|gilt]] were then applied on top of this, and re-fired at a lower temperature.&lt;ref name="IAM"/&gt;

'''''Sex and the Single Girl''''' is a 1962 non-fiction book by American writer [[Helen Gurley Brown]], written as an advice book that encouraged women to become financially independent and experience sexual relationships before or without marriage. The book sold two million copies in three weeks,&lt;ref&gt;Ouellette, Laurie. [http://mcs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/21/3/359 "Inventing the Cosmo Girl: Class Identity and Girl-Style American Dreams"]. ''[[Media, Culture &amp; Society]]'' 21 (1999): 361. Retrieved August 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; was sold in 35 countries&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon, Jennifer. [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a908971139~db=all~order=page "Sensationalist Literature or Expert Advice?"]. ''[[Feminist Media Studies]]'' 9:1 (2009): 12. Retrieved February 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and has made the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' [[bestseller]] lists.&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon. "Sensationalist". p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
In 1960 Brown's husband, [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]], suggested she write a book that discusses "how a single girl goes about having an affair".&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2012}} Lewis, Richard Warren (April 1963). [http://www.playboy.com/articles/helen-gurley-brown-playboy-interview/index.html "Playboy Interview: Helen Gurley Brown"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123150810/http://www.playboy.com/articles/helen-gurley-brown-playboy-interview/index.html |date=November 23, 2009 }}. ''[[Playboy]]''.  Retrieved February 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was rejected by several publishing houses until it was accepted by [[Bernard J. Geis]] of Bernard Geis Associates.&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon. "Sensationalist". p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original title was ''Sex for the Single Girl'', but this was changed because "it sounded like [it] was advocating sex for all single girls."&lt;ref name="lewis" /&gt; Brown had also written a section on [[contraceptive]] methods that was omitted from the final publication.&lt;ref name="lewis" /&gt;

The book was advertised through a large-scale campaign created by [[Letty Cottin Pogrebin]] of Bernard Geis Associates in conjunction with Brown. The campaign involved print ads as well as television, radio and bookstore appearances, however, Brown often was barred from saying "sex" during her television appearances.&lt;ref name="Scanlon. Sensationalist. p. 10"&gt;Scanlon. "Sensationalist". p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Cottin and Brown also attempted to have the book censored or banned in the United States as a marketing gimmick, but they were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon. "Sensationalist". p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The book also was endorsed on the jacket by [[Joan Crawford]] and [[Gypsy Rose Lee]],&lt;ref name="Scanlon. Sensationalist. p. 10"/&gt; and the 2003 edition is endorsed on the back cover by ''[[Sex and the City]]'''s [[Kim Cattrall]].

Following the success of ''Sex and the Single Girl'', Brown became the editor of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon, Jennifer. [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a907937094~db=all~jumptype=rss "Sexy from the Start: Anticipatory Elements of Second Wave Feminism"]. ''[[Women's Studies (journal)|Women's Studies]]'' 38.2 (2009): 129. Retrieved February 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to publish several other books which include ''Sex and the Office'' (1965), ''Helen Gurley Brown's Single Girl's Cookbook'' (1969), and ''Sex and the New Single Girl'' (1970).

==Summary==
'''Introduction (New 2003)'''&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Helen Gurley (2003), ''Sex and the Single Girl'' (New Jersey: [[Barricade Books]]), pp. xi–xix.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 2003 edition, Brown includes a reintroduction to her book and briefly outlines the static situations and changes that the single woman has faced from the 1960s to 2003.

*"Chapter 1. Women Alone? Oh Come Now!"&lt;ref&gt;Brown. ''Sex''. pp. 3–11.&lt;/ref&gt; The first chapter introduces the single girl to the advantages of her situation, and offers brief advice that will be expanded upon in the following chapters.
*"Chapter 2. The Availables: The Men in Your Life"&lt;ref&gt;Brown. ''Sex''. pp. 12–32.&lt;/ref&gt;  Brown suggests that the single girl make a list of all the men in her life and then slot them into the following categories: "The Eligibles",&lt;ref name="Brown. Sex. p. 17"&gt;Brown. ''Sex''. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; "The Eligibles-But-Who-Needs-Them",&lt;ref name="Brown. Sex. p. 17"/&gt; "The Don Juans",&lt;ref&gt;Brown. ''Sex''. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; "The Married Man",&lt;ref&gt;Brown. ''Sex''. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; "The Homosexual",&lt;ref&gt;Brown. ''Sex''. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; "The Divorcing Man"&lt;ref&gt;Brown. ''Sex''. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Younger Man".&lt;ref&gt;Brown. ''Sex''. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; She then proceeds to advise how to handle the men in each category.
*"Chapter 3. Where to Meet Them"&lt;ref&gt;Brown.

==Critical analysis==
The reviews that followed the publication of ''Sex and the Single Girl'', "were either highly favourable...or highly negative"&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon. "Sensationalist". p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and often attacked Brown's writing style and credibility. While several of Brown's concepts were "in common with the second-wave feminist arguments she precedes,"&lt;ref&gt;Whelehan, Imelda. [https://www.dora.dmu.ac.uk/handle/2086/774 "Sex and the Single Girl: Helen Fielding, Erica Jong and Helen Gurley Brown"]. ''Essays and Studies 2004: Contemporary British Women Writers'' 57 (2004): 28. Retrieved February 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; other second-wavers such as [[Betty Friedan]] "found Brown's message 'obscene and horrible.'"&lt;ref&gt;Ouellette. "Inventing". p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned regarding the criticism the book has received, Brown replied that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is how it was for me. This is how I played it. It's just a pippy-poo little book and people come back with this diatribe about its great social significance. Well it's just because nobody ever got off his high horse long enough to write to single women in any form they could associate with. If they had, somebody else would be the arbiter for single women at this point instead of me.&lt;ref name="lewis" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jennifer Scanlon, author of ''Bad Girls Go Everywhere: The Life of Helen Gurley Brown'', argues that through ''Sex and the Single Girl'' Brown became "not only one of the founders of second wave feminism but stands as a key antecedent for the third."&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon. "Sexy". p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Scanlon also argues that with ''Sex and the Single Girl'', Brown would "cross the line between the fictional and the real", exploring the real single women that had been previously presented in fictional form in such novels as ''[[Peyton Place (novel)|Peyton Place]]'' (1956) and ''[[The Best of Everything (novel)|The Best of Everything]]'' (1958).&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon. "Sensationalist". p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Julie Berebitsky explores the impact of ''Sex and the Single Girl'' on the [[pink-collar worker]] of the 1960s and Brown's blurring of the professional and the personal in a business environment, as she "directed women to seek professional advancement...to use gender, and to varying degrees, sexuality for their own gain."&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2012}} Berebitsky, Julie. [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_the_history_of_sexuality/v015/15.1berebitsky.html "The Joy of Work: Helen Gurley Brown, Gender, and Sexuality in the White-Collar Office"]. ''[[Journal of the History of Sexuality]]'' 15.1 (2006): 90. Retrieved February 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Berebitsky also contrasts ''Sex and the Single Girl'' with ''The Executive Secretary'', a guidebook published in 1959 by Marilyn Burke, secretary to [[Dale Carnegie]] and Dorothy Carnegie,&lt;ref&gt;Berebitsky. "Joy". p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; that cautions against demonstrations of female sexuality in the workforce.

==Interpretation==
Scanlon suggests that ''[[Sex and the City]]'' is "the most direct descendent of the sexual politics Helen Gurley Brown introduced in ''Sex and the Single Girl''"&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon. "Sexy". p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; and Jane Gerhard argues that "''Sex and the City'' pays direct homage"&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard, Jane. [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a713735104 "Sex and the City"]. ''[[Feminist Media Studies]]'' 5.1 (2005): 38. Retrieved February 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; to ''Sex and the Single Girl'', as both present the "connection between women's financial independence and their sexual liberation."&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard. "City" p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]'s ''[[Mad Men]]'' creator [[Matthew Weiner]] frequently attributes ''Sex and the Single Girl'' and ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' as heavily influencing the creation of his characters and scenarios, especially involving the single female office worker.&lt;ref&gt;Lyford, Kathy (October 22, 2008).

==Supplemented edition==
The Four Square paperback edition published (in London) in 1964 includes "£ove $tory", an unpaginated 32-page supplement by the cartoonist and illustrator [[John Glashan]], between pages 128 and 129.

==Film adaptation==
{{main| Sex and the Single Girl (film)}}
[[Warner Bros.]] paid $200,000 for the rights to the book that was made into a [[Sex and the Single Girl (film)|film of the same name]] (1964), starring [[Natalie Wood]], [[Tony Curtis]], [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Lauren Bacall]]. The film version follows the main character, Dr. Helen Gurley Brown (Wood), who is based loosely on Brown, through several comedic situations resulting from the publication of her book ''Sex and the Single Girl''.

[[File:SubtractiveColor.svg|thumb|Subtractive color mixing]]
[[File:Duhauron1877.jpg|thumb|200px|An 1877 color photo by [[Louis Ducos du Hauron]], a French pioneer of [[color photography]]. The overlapping subtractive yellow, cyan and red (magenta) image elements can be seen clearly along the edges of the image.]]
A '''subtractive color''' model explains the mixing of a limited set of [[dye]]s, [[ink]]s, [[paint]] [[pigment]]s or natural colorants to create a wider range of [[color]]s, each the result of partially or completely subtracting (that is, absorbing) some wavelengths of [[light]] and not others. The color that a surface displays depends on which parts of the [[visible spectrum]] are not absorbed and therefore remain visible.

Subtractive color systems start with light, presumably white light. Colored inks, paints, or filters between the watchers and the light source or reflective surface ''subtract'' wavelengths from the light, giving it color.  If the incident light is other than white, our visual mechanisms are able to compensate well, but not perfectly, often giving a flawed impression of the "true" color of the surface.

Conversely, [[additive color]] systems start with darkness. Light sources of various wavelengths are added in various proportions to produce a range of colors. Usually, three [[primary color]]s are combined to stimulate humans’ [[trichromatic]] [[color vision]], sensed by the three types of [[cone cell]]s in the eye, giving an apparently full range.

== RGB ==
[[File:Rueda de colores.png|thumb|left|Standard RYB Color Wheel]]
{{main|RYB color model}}

RGB (Red, green, Blue) is the formerly standard set of subtractive primary colors used for mixing pigments. It is used in art and art education, particularly in [[painting]]. It predated modern scientific [[color theory]].

Red, yellow, and blue are the primary colors of the standard [[color wheel|color "wheel"]].  The secondary colors, violet (or purple), orange, and green (VOG) make up another triad, formed by mixing equal amounts of red and blue, red and yellow, and blue and yellow, respectively.

[[File:Pigment Colours - Classification.jpg|thumb|Classification of pigment colors]]

The RYB primary colors became the foundation of 18th century theories of color vision as the fundamental sensory qualities blended in the perception of all physical colors and equally in the physical mixture of pigments or dyes. These theories were enhanced by 18th-century investigations of a variety of purely psychological color effects, in particular the contrast between "complementary" or opposing hues produced by color afterimages and in the contrasting shadows in colored light. These ideas and many personal color observations were summarized in two founding documents in color theory: the ''[[Theory of Colors]]'' (1810) by the German poet and government minister [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], and ''The Law of Simultaneous Color Contrast'' (1839) by the French industrial chemist [[Michel-Eugène Chevreul]].

In late 19th and early to mid-20th century commercial printing, use of the traditional RYB terminology persisted even though the more versatile CMY (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) triad had been adopted, with the cyan sometimes referred to as "process blue" and the magenta as "process red".

== CMY and CMYK printing processes ==
{{main|CMYK color model}}

In [[color printing]], the usual primary colors are [[cyan]], [[magenta]] and [[yellow]] (CMY). Cyan is the complement of red, meaning that the cyan serves as a filter that absorbs red. The amount of cyan applied to a white sheet of paper controls how much of the red in white light will be reflected back from the paper. Ideally, the cyan is completely transparent to green and blue light and has no effect on those parts of the [[visible spectrum|spectrum]]. Magenta is the complement of [[green]], and yellow the complement of [[blue]]. Combinations of different amounts of the three can produce a wide range of colors with good [[saturation (color theory)|saturation]].

In [[inkjet printing|inkjet color printing]] and typical [[mass production]] [[lithography|photomechanical printing processes]], a black ink K (Key) component is included, resulting in the [[CMYK color model]]. The black ink serves to cover unwanted tints in dark areas of the printed image, which result from the imperfect transparency of commercially practical CMY inks; to improve image sharpness, which tends to be degraded by imperfect registration of the three color elements; and to reduce or eliminate consumption of the more expensive color inks where only black or gray is required.

Purely [[color photography|photographic color processes]] almost never include a K component, because in all common processes the CMY dyes used are much more perfectly transparent, there are no registration errors to camouflage, and substituting a black dye for a saturated CMY combination, a trivial prospective cost benefit at best, is technologically impractical in non-electronic [[analog photography]].

'''''Symphony: Mathis der Maler''''' (''Matthias the Painter'') is among the most famous orchestral works of German composer [[Paul Hindemith]].  Music from the symphony was incorporated into, or reworked for, Hindemith's opera ''[[Mathis der Maler (opera)|Mathis der Maler]]'', which concerns the painter [[Matthias Grünewald]] (or Neithardt).

== History ==
Hindemith composed the symphony in 1934, while plans for the opera were in their preliminary stages. The conductor [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]] asked him at that time for a new work to perform on an upcoming [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]] concert tour, and Hindemith decided to compose symphonic movements that could serve as instrumental interludes in the opera, or be drawn upon or elaborated into various scenes. Furtwängler and the Berlin Philharmonic gave the first performance on 12 March 1934. The first performance outside Germany was given by the New York Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra in October 1934, conducted by [[Otto Klemperer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burke|first=Kenneth|title=Hindemith Does His Part|journal=The Nation|year=1934|volume=139|pages=487–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other performances include the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra in 1936, conducted by [[Daniel Sternberg]].

The symphony was well received at its first performances, but Furtwängler faced severe criticism from the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] government for performing the work, given that other Hindemith scores had been denounced by the party as "degenerate" and "Jewish connected." Moreover the opera's plot, which turned on an artist's duty to pursue his vision irrespective of political considerations, was anathema to Nazi ideology.  Hindemith completed the full opera by 1935 but, because of the political climate it could not be staged in Germany, and only in 1938 was it at last premiered, in [[Zürich]], Switzerland.

==Structure==
The symphony has three [[movement (music)|movements]]:

# Engelkonzert (Angelic Concert)
# Grablegung (Entombment)
# Versuchung des heiligen Antonius (The Temptation of Saint Anthony)

which correspond to the opera as follows:

*Overture
*Orchestral interlude from the last act
*Orchestral piece reworked and amplified into a visionary scene in Scene 6 of the Opera

Each movement relates to a tableau painted by Grünewald for the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]], an elaborate construction of panels behind panels, which presents different views as its various levels are unfolded. The Concert of Angels is seen when the outer wings of the altarpiece are opened; the Entombment remains always visible at the base of the altarpiece below the wings; and the [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]]-like Temptation of St. Anthony is uncovered when the inner wings are opened. Grünewald juxtaposed religious serenity with depictions of suffering grounded in the tensions that wracked 16th century Germany during the peasant uprising prompted by the [[Reformation]]. These contrasts are faithfully mirrored in Hindemith's score, which offers at once a portrait of a turbulent historical era and an urgent contemporary statement born amid political strife. 

Hindemith's principle of harmonic fluctuation is readily apparent in this work. For example, the second movement opens on a perfect fifth sonority and gradually introduces more dissonant pitches. The result is an implied tonal center, although in much of his harmony the [[functional tonality]] of tradition plays no governing role.

'''''The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks''''' (2010) is a [[non-fiction]] book by American author [[Rebecca Skloot]].  It was the 2011 winner of the [[National Academies Communication Award]] for best creative work that helps the public understanding of topics in science, engineering or medicine.

==About==
The book is about [[Henrietta Lacks]] and the [[Biological immortality#Cell lines|immortal cell line]], known as [[HeLa]], that came from Lacks's [[cervical cancer]] cells in 1951. Skloot became interested in Lacks after a biology teacher referenced her, but didn't know much about her. Skloot began conducting extensive research on her and worked with Lacks' family to create the book. The book is notable for its [[science writing]] and dealing with [[ethics in medicine|ethical issues]] of race and class in [[medical research]]. Skloot said that some of the information was taken from the journal of Deborah Lacks, Henrietta Lacks's daughter, as well as from "archival photos and documents, scientific and historical research." It is Skloot's first book.&lt;ref name=teisch&gt;Jessica Teisch, "Floyd Skloot &amp; Rebecca Skloot", in ''[[Bookmarks (magazine)|Bookmarks]]'', May/June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 1,250,000 copies (all media) have been sold, totaling approx. $32,500,000(USD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rebeccaskloot.com|title=Rebecca Skloot|website=rebeccaskloot.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
The book was initially released in hardcover, published by [[Crown Publishing Group|Crown]], on February 2, 2010 ({{ISBN|978-1-4000-5217-2}}). On the same date, an audiobook edition was published by [[Random House Audio]], narrated by Casandra Campbell and Bahni Turpin ({{ISBN|978-0-307-71250-9}}), as well as electronic editions in mobile (Kindle) and Epub formats. A paperback edition was published by [[Broadway Books]] on March 8, 2011 ({{ISBN|978-1-4000-5218-9}}). It has also been translated into more than 25 foreign language editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UK Publisher of The Immortal Life Shares Story of UK Cover Design |url=http://rebeccaskloot.com/2011/07/uk-publisher-of-the-immortal-life-shares-story-of-uk-cover-design/ |work=RebeccaSkloot.com |date=July 26, 2011 |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
Critical reception was largely favorable. It was named a best book of the year by more than 60 media outlets, including ''[[New York Times]]'', ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'', ''[[NPR]]'', and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.&lt;ref name=RandomHouse/&gt; [[Lisa Margonelli]] reviewing in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' said:
{{quote|Skloot narrates the science lucidly, tracks the racial politics of medicine thoughtfully and tells the Lacks family’s often painful history with grace. She also confronts the spookiness of the cells themselves, intrepidly crossing into the spiritual plane on which the family has come to understand their mother’s continued presence in the world. Science writing is often just about “the facts.” Skloot’s book, her first, is far deeper, braver and more wonderful.&lt;ref name="margonelli"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/07/books/review/Margonelli-t.html "Eternal Life"], By Lisa Margonelli, ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', February 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Dwight Garner (critic)|Dwight Garner]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote:

One reviewer for ''[[The New Atlantis (journal)|The New Atlantis]]'', while mostly positive about the book, questioned its ethical arguments about tissue markets and [[informed consent]] involving scientists such as [[Chester M. Southam]], and claimed to have found factual errors: one related to the role of HeLa cells in early space missions, and, another related to a statement in the book that says "if all HeLa cells ever grown could have been gathered on a scale, their total weight would have measured more than 50 million metric tons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/what-is-the-body-worth|title=What Is the Body Worth?|author=Ari N.

She clarifies that "it was a hypothetical calculation because that many cells couldn’t have been saved and put on a scale." She also says that the figures "were verified before the book went to press by the scientists who did the original calculations, and outside experts." &lt;ref&gt;[http://rebeccaskloot.com/faq/#questions-science "On The Science of HeLa Cells"], by Rebecca Skloot, captured October 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic reception===
The book was adopted as a [[common reading]] text at more than 125 universities and was widely taught in high school, undergraduate, graduate and doctoral classrooms.&lt;ref name=RandomHouse&gt;{{cite web |title=The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/highschool/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9781400052189&amp;ref=blog_lacksevanshs |publisher=[[Random House]] |work=online catalog |date=2015 |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}{{COI source|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, schools in [[Knox County, Tennessee]] were faced with demands from a parent that the book be removed from Knox County classrooms and libraries; the parent in question alleged that the scene in which Lacks discovered her tumor was depicted in a "pornographic" way.&lt;ref name=GraunBan&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/09/henrietta-lacks-book-rebecca-kloots-porn-allegation-tennessee-parent  Henrietta Lacks biographer Rebecca Skloot responds to US parent over 'porn' allegation], by Alison Flood, in ''[[the Guardian]]''; published September 9, 2015; retrieved September 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, it was announced that a television film project based on the book was in development.

In Alex Garland's film ''[[Annihilation (film)|Annihilation]]'' (2018), Natalie Portman's character is seen reading the book in one scene; her character is a geneticist and the film explores genetic mutations.

Klein]] as a classic in the field of the [[supernatural]].&lt;ref name="American Supernatural Tales 1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Chambers, Robert W(illiam) |first=T. E.

"The Yellow Sign" inspired a [[The Yellow Sign#Film|film of the same name]] released in 2001.

The British first edition was published by [[Chatto &amp; Windus]] in 1895 (316 pages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?25609 |title= The King in Yellow |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=[[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stories==
The first four stories are loosely connected by three main devices:

* A play in book form entitled ''The King in Yellow''
* A mysterious and malevolent supernatural entity known as the King in Yellow
* An eerie symbol called the [[Yellow Sign]]

These stories are macabre in tone, centering, in keeping with the other tales, on characters that are often artists or [[decadence|decadents]], inhabitants of the ''demi-monde''.

The first and fourth stories, "The Repairer of Reputations" and "The Yellow Sign", are set in an imagined future 1920s America, whereas the second and third stories, "The Mask" and "In the Court of the Dragon", are set in Paris. These stories are haunted by the theme: "Have you found the Yellow Sign?"

The weird and macabre character gradually fades away during the remaining stories, and the last three are written in the romantic fiction style common to Chambers' later work. They are all linked to the preceding stories by their Parisian setting and their artistic protagonists.

===List of stories===
The stories in the book are:
[[File:Repairer of Reputations Chapter 1.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Hildred Castaigne in "[[The Repairer of Reputations]]", illustration by Tucker Sherry.]]
* "[[The Repairer of Reputations]]" – A weird story of egotism and paranoia which carries the imagery of the book's title.
* "The Mask" – A dream story of art, love, and uncanny science.
* "[[In the Court of the Dragon]]" – A man is pursued by a sinister church organist who is after his soul.

==The play called ''The King in Yellow''==
The fictional play ''The King in Yellow,'' has at least two acts and at least three characters: Cassilda, Camilla and "The Stranger", who may or may not be the title character.

Chambers' story collection excerpts some sections from the play to introduce the book as a whole, or individual stories. For example, "Cassilda's Song" comes from Act 1, Scene 2 of the play:

:Along the shore the cloud waves break,
:The twin suns sink behind the lake,
:The shadows lengthen
::In [[Carcosa]].

:Strange is the night where black stars rise,
:And strange moons circle through the skies,
:But stranger still is
::Lost Carcosa.

:Songs that the [[Hyades (mythology)|Hyades]] shall sing,
:Where flap the tatters of the King,
:Must die unheard in
::Dim Carcosa.

:Song of my soul, my voice is dead,
:Die thou, unsung, as tears unshed
:Shall dry and die in
::Lost Carcosa.&lt;ref name="Cassilda"&gt;"The King in Yellow" in e.g. {{cite book

 | isbn = 1-56882-170-0
 | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short story "The Mask" is introduced by an excerpt from Act 1, Scene 2d:

:''Camilla: You, sir, should unmask.''
:''Stranger: Indeed?''
:''Cassilda: Indeed it's time. We have all laid aside disguise but you.''
:''Stranger: I wear no mask.''
:''Camilla: (Terrified, aside to Cassilda.) No mask? No mask!''&lt;ref name="Mask"&gt;"The Mask" in e.g. {{cite book

 | publisher = [[Chaosium]]
 | isbn = 1-56882-170-0
 | page = 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also stated, in "The Repairer of Reputations", that the final moment of the first act involves the character of Cassilda on the streets, screaming in a horrified fashion, "Not upon us, oh, king! Not upon us!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chambers | first = Robert W. | authorlink = Robert W. Chambers | year = 2004 | title = The Yellow Sign and Other Stories | series = Call of Cthulhu Fiction | publisher = [[Chaosium]] | isbn = 1-56882-170-0 | page = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the excerpts come from Act I. The stories describe Act I as quite ordinary, but reading Act II drives the reader mad with the "irresistible" revealed truths. "The very banality and innocence of the first act only allowed the blow to fall afterward with more awful effect." Even seeing the first page of the second act is enough to draw the reader in: "If I had not caught a glimpse of the opening words in the second act I should never have finished it [...]" ("The Repairer of Reputations").

Chambers usually gives only scattered hints of the contents of the full play, as in this extract from "[[The Repairer of Reputations]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He mentioned the establishment of the Dynasty in Carcosa, the lakes which connected Hastur, Aldebaran and the mystery of the Hyades. He spoke of Cassilda and Camilla, and sounded the cloudy depths of Demhe, and the Lake of Hali. "The scolloped tatters of the King in Yellow must hide Yhtill forever," he muttered, but I do not believe Vance heard him. Then by degrees he led Vance along the ramifications of the Imperial family, to Uoht and Thale, from Naotalba and Phantom of Truth, to Aldones, and then tossing aside his manuscript and notes, he began the wonderful story of the Last King.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A similar passage occurs in "The Yellow Sign", in which two protagonists have read ''The King in Yellow'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Night fell and the hours dragged on, but still we murmured to each other of the King and the Pallid Mask, and midnight sounded from the misty spires in the fog-wrapped city. We spoke of Hastur and of Cassilda, while outside the fog rolled against the blank window-panes as the cloud waves roll and break on the shores of Hali.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Influences==
Chambers borrowed the names Carcosa, Hali and [[Hastur]] from [[Ambrose Bierce]]: specifically, his [[short story|short stories]] "[[An Inhabitant of Carcosa]]" and "Haïta the Shepherd". There is no strong indication that Chambers was influenced beyond liking the names. For example, Hastur is a god of shepherds in "Haïta the Shepherd", but is implicitly a location in "The Repairer of Reputations", listed alongside the Hyades and Aldebaran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Brian Stableford]] pointed out that the story "[[The Demoiselle d'Ys]]" was influenced by the stories of [[Théophile Gautier]], such as "Arria Marcella" (1852); both Gautier and Chambers' stories feature a love affair enabled by a supernatural [[time travel|time slip]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Stableford, "The King in Yellow" in Frank N. Magill, ed. ''Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature'', Vol 2. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Salem Press, Inc., 1983. (pp. 844-847).&lt;/ref&gt; The name Jeanne d'Ys is also a [[homophone]] for the word [[jaundice]] and continues the symbolism of The King in Yellow.

In [[Raymond Chandler]]'s 1938 detective story, also titled "The King in Yellow", the protagonist says "The King in Yellow. I read a book by that title once."

The first season of HBO's ''[[True Detective]]'' television series revolves around a string of crimes committed by the elusive "Yellow King" with [[Carcosa]] also being mentioned on numerous occasions. Black stars are also prominent in reference and imagery during the series.

[[SCP Foundation]] entry SCP-701, The Hanged King, is possibly a reference to this. The titular play being one that causes violence and insanity among both the cast and audience members.

one of his main [[Cthulhu Mythos]] stories. Lovecraft borrowed Chambers' method of only vaguely referring to supernatural events, entities, and places, thereby allowing his readers to imagine the horror for themselves. The play ''The King in Yellow'' effectively became another piece of [[Cthulhu Mythos arcane literature|occult literature in the Cthulhu Mythos]] alongside the ''[[Necronomicon]]'' and others.

In the story, Lovecraft linked the Yellow Sign to [[Hastur]], but from his brief (and only) mention it is not clear what Lovecraft meant Hastur to be. [[August Derleth]] developed Hastur into a [[Great Old One]] in his controversial reworking of Lovecraft's universe, elaborating on this connection in his own mythos stories. In the writings of Derleth and a few other latter-day Cthulhu Mythos authors, the King in Yellow is an [[Avatar]] of Hastur, so named because of his appearance as a thin, floating man covered in tattered yellow robes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In Lovecraft's cycle of horror sonnets, ''Fungi from Yuggoth'', sonnet XXVII "The Elder Pharos" mentions the last Elder One who lives alone talking to chaos via drums: "The Thing, they whisper, wears a silken mask of yellow, whose queer folds appear to hide a face not of this earth...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This thing with a silken mask of yellow also features in ''[[The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath]]''. 

In the [[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|''Call of Cthulhu'' roleplaying game]] published by [[Chaosium]], the King in Yellow is an avatar of Hastur who uses his eponymous play to spread insanity among humans. He is described as a hunched figure clad in tattered, yellow rags, who wears a smooth and featureless "Pallid Mask". Removing the mask is a sanity-shattering experience; the King's face is described as "inhuman eyes in a suppurating sea of stubby maggot-like mouths; liquescent flesh, tumorous and gelid, floating and reforming".{{attribution needed|date=November 2010}}

Although none of the characters in Chambers' book describe the plot of the play, Kevin Ross fabricated a plot for the play within the ''Call of Cthulhu'' mythos.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

''[[The Secret World]]'', a Lovecraft-inspired [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]], quotes Cassilda's Song and other elements from ''The King in Yellow'' during a quest.

The theft of a supposed manuscript of the play ''The King in Yellow'' from the British Library forms a major plot element of [[Charles Stross]]'s Lovecraft-inspired book ''[[The Annihilation Score]]''.

In Alan Moore's comic series [[Providence (Avatar Press)|''Providence'']], as well as its sequel ''[[Neonomicon]]'', Moore re-imagines the Lovecraftian mythos while referencing and borrowing heavily from ''The King in Yellow''. The book is referenced by name throughout ''Providence'', as well as referencing a fictional variation ''Sous Le Monde'', French for "Under the World." In both ''Providence'' and its sequel, a recurring character named Johnny Carcosa appears as an avatar/speaker for a Lovecraftian entity, possibly [[Nyarlathotep]] or [[Azathoth]]&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url=https://factsprovidence.wordpress.com/moore-lovecraft-comics-annotation-index/providence-10/ |title=Providence 10 |access-date=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Game designer [[Robin D. Laws]], having written a collection of Chamber-inspired stories entitled ''New Tales of the Yellow Sign'', has converted the story "Repairer of Reputations" for ''[[Trail of Cthulhu]]''. He is currently writing a Yellow King Roleplaying Game, including crossover content for the Cthulhu Mythos.

[[File:PercyFawcett.jpg|220px|right|thumb| Percy Fawcett in 1911.]]

'''''The Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon''''' is the debut non-fiction book by American author [[David Grann]]. The book was published in 2009, and recounts the activities of the British explorer [[Percy Fawcett]] who, in 1925, disappeared with his son in the Amazon while looking for an ancient lost city. For decades, explorers and scientists have tried to find evidence of his party, and of the "[[Lost City of Z]]".

Grann also recounts his own journey into the Amazon, by which he discovered new evidence about how Fawcett may have died. He learned that Fawcett may have come upon "Z" without knowing it.&lt;ref&gt;David Grann, ''Lost City of Z'', 2009, pp. 270–72&lt;/ref&gt; The book claims as many as 100 people may have died or disappeared (and are presumed dead) searching for Fawcett over the years; however, the more historically accurate toll was only one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/04/the-lost-city-of-z-is-a-very-long-way-from-a-true-story-and-i-should-know/|title=The Lost City of Z is a very long way from a true story and I should know|last=Hemming|first=John|date=1 April 2017|website=The Spectator|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Lost City of Z'' was the basis of [[The Lost City of Z (film)|a 2016 feature film of the same name]], written and directed by [[James Gray (director)|James Gray]].

==Kuhikugu==
{{main|Kuhikugu}}
First in his 2005 article "The Lost City of Z" and later in the book he developed and published with the same title, David Grann reported on excavations by the archeologist [[Michael Heckenberger]] at a site in the Amazon Xingu region that might be the long-rumored lost city. The ruins were surrounded by several concentric, circular moats, with evidence of palisades that had been described in the folklore and oral history of nearby tribes. Heckenberger also found evidence of wooden structures and roads that cut through the jungle. [[Terra preta|Black Indian earth]] showed evidence that humans had added supplements to the soil to increase its fertility to support agriculture.

Perhaps most intriguing were the direct parallels between the site, referred to as [[Kuhikugu]], and tribes of the area. Pottery methods had remained nearly identical, and the tribes followed a diet that prohibited several sources of food—striking considering the long-held belief that such prohibitions would mean death in the harsh rainforest. Contemporary villages are laid out in patterns similar to those seen at three sites of the ancient cities.

Kuhikugu encompasses more than 20 settlements, each supporting as many as 5,000 people. Construction methods showed a sophisticated engineering. The structures were made of wood, supporting a society that flourished from approximately 200 A.D. until around 1600, according to carbon-dating data obtained from the moats and pottery. Their constructions included bridges across some of the great rivers of the Amazon. Their monuments extended horizontally, rather than being built as the pyramidal structures developed by the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] or [[Inca Empire|Inca]] peoples.

The settlements and civilization of these people appeared to have lasted long enough for them to have had contact with Europeans. Many died due to new infectious diseases, which may have been carried by some of their usual indigenous trading partners, rather than directly by Europeans. The high rate of fatality of these epidemics disrupted the people and their society: in only a few years, they were so devastated by disease that they had virtually died out. The earliest [[Conquistador|conquistadors]] left records of their glimpses of this civilization, but by the time they tried to explore the rainforest again, the indigenous people were all but gone. The jungle was quickly reclaiming the land.&lt;ref&gt;Biello, David. (August 28, 2008). [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=lost-amazon-cities "Ancient Amazon Actually Highly Urbanized"], ''Scientific American.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Lost City of Z'' was reviewed by [[Rich Cohen]] in the Sunday ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'', who said it was "a powerful narrative, stiff lipped and Victorian at the center, trippy at the edges, as if one of those stern men of [[Joseph Conrad|Conrad]] had found himself trapped in a novel by [[Gabriel García Márquez|García Márquez]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Rich Cohen|Cohen, Rich]]. (February 26, 2009).[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/books/review/Cohen-t.html "On the Road to El Dorado."] ''The New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Michiko Kakutani]] ranked it as one of the ten best books of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Kakutani, Michiko. (November 26, 2009). [https://www.nytimes.com/gift-guide/holiday-2009/giftguide-kakutani/list.html "Michiko Kakutani's Top 10 Books of 2009."] ''The New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt; In her review, Kakutani wrote that it "is at once a biography, a detective story and a wonderfully vivid piece of travel writing that combines [[Bruce Chatwin]]esque powers of observation with a [[Evelyn Waugh|Waugh-like]] sense of the absurd. Mr. Grann treats us to a harrowing reconstruction of Fawcett’s forays into the Amazonian jungle, as well as an evocative rendering of the vanished age of exploration. . . . Suspenseful. . . Rollicking . . . Fascinating . . . It reads with all the pace and excitement of a movie thriller and all the verisimilitude and detail of firsthand reportage.”&lt;ref&gt;Kakutani, Michiko. (March 16, 2009). [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/books/17kaku.html "An Explorer Drawn to, and Eventually Swallowed by, the Amazon."] ''The New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Washington Post]]'' described it as "a thrill ride from start to finish."&lt;ref&gt;Arana, Marie. (March 6, 2009). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/06/AR2009030602022.html "Lost in the Jungle."] ''Washington Post.''&lt;/ref&gt; The book appeared on several "best" and "notable books of the year" lists, including that of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', ''[[Washington Post]]'', ''[[Boston Globe]]'', ''Publisher's Weekly'', ''Sunday New York Times'', ''Christian Science Monitor'', ''Bloomberg'', the ''Providence Journal'', ''The Globe and Mail'', ''Evening Standard'', Amazon, and McClatchy Newspapers. [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] ranked ''The Lost City of Z'' as the single best nonfiction book of 2009.

At the same time, critics have pointed out inaccuracies and/or distortions by Grann. Writing for ''The Wall Street Journal'', [[Simon Winchester]] said the book was "captivating" but faulted Grann's credulity, especially when he imagined that he was seeing the ruins of "Z". Winchester writes, "Oh, please. It is all just too pat, too wanting in healthy skepticism."&lt;ref&gt;Winchester, Simon. (February 27, 2009). [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123569217402288043 "The Endless Allure of El Dorado."] ''Wall Street Journal.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugh Thomson (writer)|Hugh Thomson]] writes in ''The Washington Post'' that Grann's book is "a source of distortion, as it ignores or inflates much available material on Fawcett."&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Hugh. "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/04/12/the-hero-of-the-lost-city-of-z-was-no-hero/ The hero of ‘The Lost City of Z’ was no hero]", ''[[Washington Post]],'' April 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Hemming (explorer)|John Hemming]] dismissed much of the book as hyperbolic in his review for ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', concluding, "It is a pity that a writer as good as Grann chose to study this unimportant, disagreeable and ultimately pathetic man. It is an even greater pity that he decided to inflate and distort so much of this sad story." Hemming assails Grann for dabbling in the "green-hell" genre, where the jungle is depicted as offering some new lethal threat with each footstep. The review notes Grann's exaggerations of Fawcett's exploits. Hemming said that Grann's claim that Fawcett "helped redraw the map of South America" was a "staggering exaggeration", given the insignificance of his actual expeditions. He describes Grann as "totally wrong" about both Fawcett's beliefs about [[El Dorado]] and the current state of scholarship on the subject. Hemming said that "there is no excuse for [Grann's] fantasies" about the dangers of indigenous tribes and the depth of Fawcett's contact with them.&lt;ref&gt;Hemming, John. "Gung ho ho.

The '''''Vision of Saint Jerome'''''  is a painting by the Italian [[Mannerist]] artist [[Parmigianino]], executed in 1526–1527. It is now in the [[National Gallery, London]], [[United Kingdom]].

==History==
The work was commissioned on 3 January 1526 in Rome, by Maria Bufalini, wife of Antonio Caccialupi, to decorate the family chapel in the church of [[San Salvatore in Lauro]]. The contract mentioned "Francesco Mazola de Parma" and one "Pietro" with the same name, perhaps Parmigianino's uncle Piero Ilario Mazzola. The elongated shape derives from its original destination as part of a [[triptych]], whose sides (never painted) should represent the Immaculate Conception (to which the chapel was dedicated) and the saints Joachim and Anna. 

According to late Renaissance art biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]], Parmigianino was working to this painting during the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]], and he had to stop when the city was ravaged by the imperial troops. He was able to escape paying a ransom, while his uncle remained in Rome, being able to hide the painting  in the refectory of [[Santa Maria della Pace]].
[[File:Parmigianino, visione di san girolamo 04.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Detail of St. Jerome sleeping.]]
In 1558 the Bufalini family decided to move it in their chapel in Sant'Agostino at [[Città di Castello]], from where it was acquired in 1790 by the English painter [[James Durno]]. In England, it was sold to the Marquess of Albercon for 1,500 [[guinea (coin)|guineas]], then, after a series of changes of hand, to the National Gallery, in 1826.

There are preparatory drawings in the [[Musée Condé]], the [[British Museum]] and other museums, for a total of some twenty. A drawing in the [[Galleria nazionale di Parma]] is the one which is more similar to the final version, although showing a horizontal composition.

==Description==
The painting is divided into two narrative sectors: a lower one, with [[Saint Jerome]] is sleeping near the crucifix (with his traditional symbol, the cardinal hat visible near a skull) and receives the vision of St. [[John the Baptist]], identified by the long cross and the baptismal washbasin which is tied at his belt; St. John indicates the Child, represented in the upper sector between the legs of the Madonna, with a shining background behind them.

Parmigianino's attention to detail is shown by the Baptist's reed cross, the speckled skin which covers him, the undergrowth near the sleeping Jerome, the sheen on Mary's dress, the last perhaps inspired by classical sculptures seen by Parmigianino during his trips.

St. John's raised right arm and upwards-pointing finger are reminiscent of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo's]] painting ''[[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|St. John the Baptist]]''.
