'''''ACCC v Cabcharge Australia Ltd''''' is a 2010 decision of the [[Federal Court of Australia]] brought by the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] (ACCC) against [[Cabcharge Australia Ltd]].&lt;ref name=FCA1261&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|1261|2010|litigants=ACCC v Cabcharge Australia Ltd |courtname=auto}}; {{cite AustLII|FCA|837|2010|litigants=ACCC v Cabcharge Australia Ltd (No 2) |courtname=auto}}. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, the ACCC began proceedings in the Federal Court against Cabcharge alleging that Cabcharge had breached section 46 of the Commonwealth [[Trade Practices Act]] (TPA) by misusing its market power and entering into an agreement to substantially lessen competition. The action alleged [[predatory pricing]] by Cabcharge and centred on Cabcharge's conduct in [[refusal to deal|refusing to deal]] with competing suppliers to allow Cabcharge payments to be processed through [[EFTPOS]] terminals provided by rival companies and supplying taxi meters and fare updates at below actual cost or at no cost.&lt;ref name=FCA1261/&gt;

In September 2010, to settle the action, Cabcharge admitted a number of contraventions of TPA and the Federal Court imposed a fine of $15 million ($14 million in civil penalties and $1 million in costs), the highest ever penalty imposed for misuse of market power. The judgement was delivered by Justice [[Raymond Finkelstein]] on 17 November 2010.

==Background==
Cabcharge provides various products and services in Australia and overseas, predominantly to taxi drivers, owners and networks (the firms that provide booking and dispatch services to drivers and owners). The services that Cabcharge provide include non-cash payment processing systems for taxi fares, payment processing systems for taxis and provision of taxi meters. The company holds a dominant market position in these services across Australia as it supplies almost 97% of Australian taxis with its electronic payment system.

The ACCC began proceedings in June 2009 in the Federal Court against Cabcharge Australia Ltd. The ACCC action alleged that Cabcharge had breached section 46 of the Trade Practices Act (TPA) by misusing its market power and entering into an agreement to substantially lessen competition. The action alleged [[predatory pricing]] by Cabcharge and centred on Cabcharge's conduct in refusing to deal with competing suppliers to allow Cabcharge payments to be processed through EFTPOS terminals provided by rival companies and supplying taximeters and meter updates at below actual cost or at no cost.&lt;ref name=FCA1261/&gt;
 
At the relevant date, to breach Section 46 of the TPA, a corporation must have misused its substantial market power to:
 
* eliminate or substantially damage a competitor 
* prevent the entry of a person into that market or any other market; or	
* deter or prevent a person from engaging in competitive conduct in that market or any other market.
 
Section 46 of the TPA was amended numerous times since September 2007 to strengthen the ACCC's ability to successfully bring proceedings for alleged contraventions. For example, in September 2007, a sub-section 46(1AA) was introduced into the TPA to prohibit corporations with substantial market share from engaging in [[predatory pricing]]. Predatory pricing occurs when a company sets its prices below cost for a sustained period for one of the [[anti-competitive]] purposes referred to above. In November 2008, the TPA was amended again to make clear the circumstances when corporations had 'taken advantage' of their market power. This change sought to deal with the evidentiary difficulties the regulator encountered in establishing this element in earlier cases. Since January 2007, the courts have also been given power to impose a [[civil penalty]] for each act or omission contravening the TPA. Civil penalties can now be imposed up to the greater of $10 million, three times the value of the benefit obtained from the misconduct, or 10% of the annual Australian turnover of the company involved.

==Resolution==
===Cabcharge admissions===
To settle the proceedings, Cabcharge admitted to three contraventions of the TPA. The company agreed to the issue by the court of declarations, compliance orders, civil penalties of $14 million and costs of $1 million.&lt;ref name=FCA1261/&gt;

=== Cabcharge settlement ===
On 24 September 2010, Justice Finkelstein approved the settlement of the action and declared that Cabcharge had breached the TPA by taking advantage of its substantial degree of power in the Australian markets for the supply of services to enable non-cash payments for taxi fares and charges by taxi passengers and non-cash instruments that could be used only for the payment of taxi fares and charges.

==Judgement==

===Refusal to deal===
It was found that since 2005 Cabcharge had unreasonably refused to deal with a potential competitor (namely Travel Tab which had changed its name to Mpos in January 2007) in the payments and instruments markets by refusing to allow Travel Tab/MPos to process Cabcharge instruments (e.g., Cabcharge cards) on Mpos EFTPOS equipment. It was found that: "With respect to both refusals, Cabcharge acknowledges that although there would have been time and costs involved in developing appropriate interfaces, there was no technical reason that would prevent any electronic taxi-specific payment product from being processed by any EFTPOS terminal as long as that taxi-specific instrument and the relevant EFTPOS terminals complied with all relevant banking/financial industry protocols, including security protocols."

It was found that: "Cabcharge’s refusals were for the purpose of preventing Travel Tab/MPos from processing Cabcharge instruments electronically and resulted in Cabcharge’s payment processing system remaining the only system that processed Cabcharge’s instruments electronically."&lt;ref name=FCA1261/&gt;

===Predatory pricing===
Between September 2004 and October 2007 Cabcharge acquired taximeters at a cost of $250 per meter. Of these, Cabcharge supplied approximately 727 units free of charge and approximately 5613 units at an invoiced price of $100 (of which it did not obtain any payment for approximately 758 units). At the time its competitors sold meters for between $430–550 plus GST. Cabcharge installed 197 meters free of charge at an estimated cost of $120 to $160 per installation. From 9 November 2007, it sold meters at a retail price of $250.

In addition, Cabcharge supplied meter updates free to networks and operators, notwithstanding that it incurred costs of around $75,000 to supply these updates. At the time its competitors charged $70 to $110 plus GST per update. Cabcharge funded its losses from profits it made from its payment processing systems.

It was found that Cabcharge took advantage of the substantial degree of power it had in the payment processing market for the purposes of: (1) affecting the profitability of other suppliers of meters and updates; (2) ensuring that other suppliers of meters and updates could not match or be price competitive with Cabcharge; and (3) ensuring that alternative suppliers did not commence supplying electronic processing services.&lt;ref name=FCA1261/&gt;

'''Aleksandr Bokovikov''' (September 7, 1956, [[Katangsky District|Ayan]] – August 8, 2010) was a [[Russia]]n politician and businessman who served as the Governor of the now defunct [[Evenk Autonomous Okrug]] from 1997 until 2001.&lt;ref name=rulers&gt;{{cite news |title=August 2010 timeline |url=http://rulers.org/2010-08.html|work=Rulers.org |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=itartass&gt;{{cite news |title=The first governor of the Evenki Autonomous Areadies dies |url=http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=15388300 |work=[[Information Telegraph Agency of Russia]] |date=2010-08-09 |accessdate=2010-08-12 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Evenk Autonomous Okrug was later merged into the Krasnoyarsk Krai on January 1, 2007, and incorporated into the [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]] as the [[Evenkiysky District]].

==Biography==

===Political career===
Bokovikov was elected as the first chairman of the Evenk Autonomous Okrug legislature, known as the Sulgan, in 1994.&lt;ref name=itartass/&gt;&lt;ref name=ewi&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert W.|last=Orttung|title=The Republics and Regions of the Russian Federation: A Guide to Politics, Policies and Leaders  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VroABgoe4-EC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Aleksandr+Bokovikov+evenk&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6r5X-nWxHy&amp;sig=7vgAV2H7pCQ3j_XF9g_tWNZG6Jk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ft1jTIzOCIGB8gbe1bCuDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Aleksandr%20Bokovikov%20evenk&amp;f=false |work=[[EastWest Institute]] |publisher=[[Google Books]] |date=2000 |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governor of Evenk Autonomous Okrug===
Bokovikov announced his candidacy for Governor of Evenk Autonomous Okrug in the 1996 gubernatorial election. He ran with the backing of both the National Patriotic Union of Russia and the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]].&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt; Bokovikov's main opponent was the incumbent head of the Evenk Autonomous Okrug, [[Anatolii Yakimov]], who was supported by the All Russia Coordinating Council.&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt;

The gubernatorial election was held on December 22, 1996,&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt; but it would be March 1997 before a victor was announced due to irregularities in the election results.&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt; The initial election results showed Bokovikov defeating Yakimov by less than 100 votes.&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt; However, the final vote tally had Yakimov being re-elected by 550 votes over Bokovikov.&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt; Bokovikov filed a lawsuit against the Evenk Autonomous Okrug's [[Election management body|election commission]], with the goal of having the 1996 election results overturned.&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt; The results were not overturned, but a new gubernatorial election was held in March 1997 instead.&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt;

Aleksandr Bokovikov was elected Governor of Evenk Autonomous Okrug on March 16, 1997, nearly four months after the disputed December election.&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt;

Much of his focus as Governor pertained to [[economic development]] in the [[okrug]] and raising the [[standard of living]].&lt;ref name=itartass/&gt;  He also opposed the sale of public land.&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt;

Bokovikov actively supported the Evenk Autonomous Okrug remaining a constituent part of the [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]].&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt; Bokovikov signed a June 1997 treaty with then Krasnoyarsk Krai Governor [[Valerii Zubov]] which explicitly stated that Evenk Autonomous Okrug was part of Krasnoyarsk Krai.&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt; The agreement also allowed residents of Evenk Autonomous Okrug to vote in Krasnoyarsk Krai's gubernatorial and legislative elections.&lt;ref name=ewi/&gt;

Bokovikov remained Governor of Evenk Autonomous Okrug until 2001. He was succeeded by [[Boris Zolotaryov]], the last Governor of Evenk Autonomous Okrug before the okrug was abolished and incorporated into Krasnoyarsk Krai on January 1, 2010.

===Later life===
Bokovikov became the director of the Evenkiyanefteprodukt company after leaving office. He was elected to the Council of deputies in [[Tura, Krasnoyarsk Krai|Tura]], [[Evenkiysky District]].&lt;ref name=itartass/&gt;

Aleksandr Bokovikov died on August 8, 2010, at the age of 53.&lt;ref name=rulers/&gt;&lt;ref name=itartass/&gt;

'''American Society of Mining and Reclamation''' ('''ASMR''') is an advisory council which focuses on the reclamation of lands that had been disturbed by coal extraction. ASMR is a professional society with international prominence, including members from 20 countries. ASMR initially focused on lands disturbed by coal mining. Today the organization focus includes all aspects of land reclamation and protection, and enhancement of soil and water resources.&lt;ref name="trib_Wyom"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Wyoming DEQ recognized for reclamation work| last = Press | first = The Associated| work = Casper Star-Tribune Online| date = 2014-06-30| accessdate = 2015-04-03| url = http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/wyoming-deq-recognized-for-reclamation-work/article_13897016-abd0-5d27-86ef-145ff8fd277c.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="djou_Brea"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Breaking records Ahead of its 20th anniversary, the BancorpSouth Arena has its most successful year and soon will get a face-lift| author = Sheena Barnett| work = Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal| date = 2012-10-15| accessdate = 2015-04-03| url = http://djournal.com/news/breaking-recordsahead-of-its-20th-anniversary-the-bancorpsouth-arena-has-its-most-successful-year-and-soon-will-get-a-face-lift/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hu2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zhenqi Hu|title=Legislation, Technology and Practice of Mine Land Reclamation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wIvaBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR11|date=23 September 2014|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-138-02724-4|pages=11–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16442">'''British qualified accountants''' are full voting members of [[United Kingdom]] professional bodies that evaluate individual experience and test [[Competence (human resources)|competencies]] for [[accountant]]s.

The term ''accountant'' does not have the same legal protection in the United Kingdom as that given to other professions such as doctors and lawyers. Only certain functions are restricted to professionally qualified accountants; for example, individuals who operate in the areas of [[financial audit|audit]] and [[insolvency]] must be registered, and only members of certain accountancy bodies are eligible for such registration. If working in public practice, these qualified accountants must comply with additional regulations such as holding [[professional indemnity insurance]] (as accountants are one of the professions most at risk of professional indemnity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.obf.ie/professional-indemnity-claim/|title=Top 5 Occupations At Risk From Professional Indemnity Claims|last=|first=|date=28 March 2018|website=OBF.ie|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and submitting to regular and independent inspections.

'''CCAB-qualified accountants''' is an informal shorthand for full members of any of the UK [[accountancy]] bodies formed by [[royal charter]]. All six of these bodies founded the [[Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies]] in 1974; CIMA left after 2011, but its members may still be intended when this phrase is used.

The British Government's [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]], implementing the Companies Acts 1989 and [[Companies Act 2006|2006]], allows members of six bodies to act as [[financial audit|auditor]] to a [[limited company]].  These are the five member bodies of CCAB, and the AIA.
In the [[European Union]], under the EU mutual recognition directive, members of these six bodies may practise auditing in other EU member states, with 'absolute equal status'.

In addition, there are other non-CCAB bodies whose members also provide accountancy and related services.

==Recognised bodies for restricted work==

==={{anchor|RQB}}Audit of limited companies===
It is illegal for any individual or firm that is not a '''Registered Auditor''' to perform an audit of a UK limited company. To become a Registered Auditor, an accountant must hold a practising certificate from a recognised body, demonstrate the necessary professional ability in that area, and submit to regular inspection.

Certain bodies, known under the Companies Acts 1989 and 2006 as '''Recognised Qualifying Bodies''' ('''RQBs'''), award the qualifications necessary for audit work, as an entry requirement. A similar but not identical list of '''Recognised Supervisory Bodies''' ('''RSBs''') may authorise their members to carry out company audits.

The six RQBs in relation to company auditing under the Companies Acts are:&lt;ref name=UK-list&gt;[http://www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/Conduct/Professional-oversight/Oversight-of-Audit/Recognition-of-Recognised-Supervisory-Bodies-and-R/Current-RSBs-and-RQBs.aspx Current RSBs and RQBs], [[Financial Reporting Council]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIA and CIPFA are not RSBs; their members, if engaging in audit, must therefore be supervised by another body.
The [[Association of Authorised Public Accountants]] (AAPA) has the status of RSB, historically under a [[grandfather clause]] in order to supervise individuals who had been authorised for audit purposes under the Companies Act 1948. 

RQBs and RSBs are self-regulated but monitored by the [[Professional Oversight Board]] (POB), part of the [[Financial Reporting Council]] (FRC), to support public confidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frc.org.uk/pob/ Professional Oversight Board] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226042053/http://www.frc.org.uk/pob/ |date=December 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[European Union]]'s [[European professional qualification directives|Mutual Recognition Directive]], all British accountants with practising rights and belonging to a RQB/RSB can practice as a public accountants in all member countries of the [[European Union]], [[European Economic Area]] and [[Switzerland]], providing that they are citizens of one of these states. They can describe themselves only by their own accountancy qualification rather than the local professional accountant qualification; access to the local professional qualifications is based on an aptitude test.

Various other national bodies have [[mutual recognition agreement]]s with most British RQBs. For example, in Hong Kong, members of RQBs excluding CIPFA are accredited by [[Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants|HKICPA]] and therefore licensed under the Professional Accountants Ordinance with 'absolute equal status' to local CPAs.

===Insolvency and investment business work===
Under the Companies Act, Insolvency Act &amp; Financial Services and Markets Act, only the [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]], [[ICAEW]], [[Chartered Accountants Ireland|CAI]] and [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland|ICAS]] are able to authorise members to conduct all the legally restricted work of [[insolvency]] and 'investment business work' in the United Kingdom.

==Titles of British accountancy qualifications==

In the UK, there is no licence requirement for individuals to describe themselves or practise as an accountant (except for audit or insolvency work). However, to use certain titles and designatory letters requires membership of the appropriate professional body, thus:
*Bodies with royal charter
**'''[[Chartered Accountant]]s''' must be members of one of the following:
***the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales]] (ICAEW) (designatory letters ACA or FCA)
***the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland]] (ICAS) (designatory letters CA)
***[[Chartered Accountants Ireland]] (CAI) (designatory letters ACA or FCA)
***a recognised equivalent body in another [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] country (designatory letters being CA (name of country) e.g. CA(Canada))
**'''[[Chartered Certified Accountant]]s''' must be members of the [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA) (designatory letters ACCA or FCCA)
**'''Chartered Management Accountants''' must be members of the [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]] (CIMA) (designatory letters ACMA or FCMA)
**'''Chartered Public Finance Accountants''' must be members of the [[Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy]] (CIPFA) (designatory letters CPFA)
*Other recognised bodies (RQBs and RSBs)
**'''International Accountants''' must be members of the [[Association of International Accountants]] (AIA), one of six Recognised Qualifying Bodies in the UK&lt;ref name=UK-list/&gt;   (designatory letters AAIA or FAIA)
**'''Authorised Public Accountants''' must be members of the [[Association of Authorised Public Accountants]] (AAPA), one of five Recognised Supervisory Bodies in the UK&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auditregister.org.uk/Forms/RSBList.aspx Recognised Supervisory Bodies], Register of Statutory Auditors&lt;/ref&gt; (designatory letters AAPA)
*Other professional bodies
**'''Financial Accountants''' are members of the [[Institute of Financial Accountants]] (IFA) (designatory letters FAE, AFA or FFA). Since the amalgamation with the [[Institute of Public Accountants]] (IPA) in January 2015 IFA members are "Qualified Accountants" under the Australian law as the IPA is one of the three legally recognised local professional accounting bodies of Australia.{{importance-inline|date=February 2016}}
**'''[[Certified Public Accountant]]s''' may be members of the [[Association of Certified Public Accountants]] (CPA) (designatory letters ACPA or FCPA), or of a CPA body in another country
**'''Fellow Business Accountants''' are fellow members of the [[International Business Accountants]] (FiBAc)
**'''Certified Practising Accountants''' are members of the [[Institute of Certified Practising Accountants]] (ICPA) (designatory letters ICPA)
**'''Registered Qualified Accountant''' with [[Accountants Institute]] (designatory letters '''RQA''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://Accountants.Institute Accountants Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/1/UK00003085384|title=Intellectual Property Office|last=Intellectual Property Office|first=Intellectual Property Office, Concept House, Cardiff Road, Newport, NP10 8QQ.|website=www.ipo.gov.uk|language=English|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{importance-inline|date=April 2016}}

===Entry requirements===
The chartered bodies and the AIA (which is the other [[#RQB|Recognised Qualifying Body]]) admit members only after passing examinations and undergoing a period of relevant work experience. [[syllabus|Syllabi]] and methods of assessment vary between these bodies, and may include a project, case study or viva (One-to-one case study and oral examination). Candidates who hold [[Bachelor of Accountancy|degrees in accounting]] or related subjects may be exempt from certain papers. Some bodies, including ICAEW, provide direct membership exchanges and short routes to admittance for members of certain overseas bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icaew.com/index.cfm/route/170597/icaew_ga/en/Home/Join_us/Members_of_other_professional_bodies/Join_us_as_a_member_of_another_professional_body Join us as a member of another professional body], ICAEW&lt;/ref&gt; Once admitted, members are expected to comply with [[business ethics|ethical guidelines]], gain appropriate professional experience and undergo [[continuing professional development]].

The other bodies recognise academic qualifications and work experience.

Most bodies offer Fellowship after five or ten years' further experience in good standing as an Associate member.

===Practising certificates===
Before engaging in practice (i.e. selling services to the public rather than acting as an employee), an accountant belonging to any of these bodies must gain a 'practising certificate' by meeting further requirements such as purchasing adequate insurance and undergoing inspections.

==Bookkeepers and accounting technicians==
Various bodies offer lower-level qualifications in [[bookkeeping]] and related skills. Individuals with such qualifications are not recognised as professionally qualified accountants.

The [[Association of Accounting Technicians]] (AAT) (designatory letters MAAT or FMAAT, standing for "Member of the Association of Accounting Technicians" or "Fellow Member of the Association of Accounting Technicians", respectively) is the UK’s leading body offering a qualification at a level between that of 'bookkeeper' and that of the Recognised Qualifying Bodies. After passing exams and obtaining relevant experience, its members can apply for MIP (Member in Practice) status and are then licensed and regulated by the AAT to provide practice accounting, tax and financial advisory services, although they are not entitled to undertake audit or insolvency work. As in the case of members of the RQBs, AAT MIPs are required to hold adequate insurances and undertake regular CPD activities relevant to the services they offer.

Practising accounting technicians are entitled to refer to themselves as 'accountants', as the term is not protected in law (unlike, say, 'solicitors' and 'doctors'). They cannot, however, present themselves as being of chartered status.

The AAT is sponsored by the professional accounting bodies CIMA, CIPFA, ICAEW and ICAS.  ACCA withdrew its sponsorship in order to establish its own similar qualification, the [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants#Certified Accounting Technician (CAT)|Certified Accounting Technician]] (CAT). CATs are not eligible for practising certificates.

The [[International Association of Book-keepers]] (IAB) offer [[Qualifications and Credit Framework]] (QCF) qualification specifically in [[bookkeeping]] and [[Payroll]]. IAB members are professionally qualified book-keepers. Members use designatory letters AIAB standing for "Associate Member of the IAB", MIAB "Member of the IAB and FIAB "Fellow Member of the IAB". FIAB can also use the designation "Registered Book-keeper". After passing exams and obtaining relevant experience, its members can apply for a Certificates of Supervision, Certificate of Compliance and eventually Certificates in Practice status, depending on membership level and experience, and are then licensed and regulated by the IAB to provide practice book-keeping, accounting, tax and financial advisory services, although they are not entitled to undertake audit or insolvency work. As in the case of members of the RQBs, IAB practicing members are required to hold adequate insurances and undertake regular CPD activities relevant to the services they offer. Although not sponsored by any other professional body, IAB qualifications are recognised by many of the bodies and members may, depending on the qualifications they hold apply for some exemptions to the other professional bodies.

AIA also offers IAT with the [[London Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry]]. 
IFA offers Financial Accounting Technician (AFT)

The [[Institute of Certified Bookkeepers]] (ICB), founded in the UK in 1996, claims over 150,000 students and members worldwide.

==CCAB-qualified accountants==

The '''[[Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies]]''' (known as '''CCAB''') was formed in 1974 as an umbrella group for the major British qualified accountancy bodies.  The six [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] professional accountancy bodies with a [[royal charter]] were the founder members of the CCAB. On 2 March 2011, the [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]] (CIMA) announced that it would be leaving CCAB, because CCAB had become more focussed on audit since the formation of the [[Financial Reporting Council]] as the regulator for accounting matters, and therefore less relevant to CIMA members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2011/02/cima-to-leave-ccab-accountancy-forum/ Cima to leave CCAB accountancy forum], ''Public Finance'', 2 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining members are:

* [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA)
* [[Chartered Accountants Ireland]] (CAI) which covers the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]], and is considered to be both a British and Irish professional body
* [[Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy]] (CIPFA)
* [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] (ICAEW)
* [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland]] (ICAS)

All full members of these bodies and CIMA are deemed to hold equivalent-level qualifications. Many job advertisements for accountants in the United Kingdom therefore specify 'CCAB qualified' as though it was a specific qualification rather than a group of qualifications. 
In practice some employers use the term as shorthand for 'professional accountant' and might consider members of non-Chartered bodies or overseas equivalents.

The CCAB bodies are [[#RQB|Recognised Qualifying Bodies]] (RQBs) in relation to company auditing under the Companies Act 2006. {{As of|2015}}, however, CIPFA's status as an RQB is currently in abeyance.&lt;ref name=UK-list/&gt;

In August 2018, #FreeDianeRwigara was being used by Kenyans on Twitter to call for Kagame to release Rwigara. This came just days after Twitter users in Kenya did the same for Uganda’s MP Robert Kyagulanyi, better known as Bobby Wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/news/freebobbywine-kenyans-now-turn-guns-strongman-kagame/|title=#FREEBOBBYWINE: KENYANS NOW TURN GUNS ON STRONGMAN KAGAME|date=24 August 2018|website=nairobi news|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Foundation Statute''' is a simple tool that helps [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundations]] better channel their resources into improving the lives of people in a wide range of areas. It aims to establish the legal form of a European Foundation which would be additional - but also complementary - to existing national forms. It would be legally recognised in all [[European Union member state|Member States]], and would operate under the same set of conditions across the [[European Union|EU]].

==Why is it needed?==
Foundations and their funders are increasingly [[International business|working across borders]]. However, a number of legal and administrative barriers are hampering foundations’ current work. The lack of appropriate legal tools means that new [[Europe]]an initiatives by foundations are delayed or abandoned.  
 
A European Foundation Statute would offer an appropriate legal tool to perform and increase foundations' work and operations across Europe, while reducing costly administrative burden.

==Status==
On 8 February 2012, the [[European Commission]] presented a proposal on a European Foundation Statute.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/company/eufoundation/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  This proposal has been shared with the [[Council of Ministers]] representing the governments of the 27 Member States for review and approval, as well as to the [[European Parliament]] for  its consent.  
 
The European Parliament pledged support to European [[statute]]s for [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundations]], associations and [[Mutual society|mutual societies]] with the signatures by a majority of its members of a written declaration in February 2011.
 
The [[European Economic and Social Committee|European Economic and Social Committee (EESC)]], the EU’s official [[advisory board|advisory body]] on [[Social issue|social]] and [[economics|economic]] matters, has given a clear and strong backing to the Statute by approving, by a large majority, the opinion drafted by EESC member Mall Hellam on 28 April 2010. The opinion urges the European Commission to present a proposal for a Regulation on a European Foundation Statute to support [[public-benefit]] activities for its adoption by the Council and the European Parliament in due course.  

The campaign to implement the European Foundation Statute is led by the European Foundation Centre and the Donors and Foundations Networks in Europe (DAFNE).

'''''Fish Tycoon ''''' is a [[casual game]] created and developed by [[Last Day of Work]]. One of the top-selling downloadable games of 2004, 2005, and 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Logler.com, "[http://www.logler.com/global-top-10 Global Casual Games Top 10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019112033/http://www.logler.com/global-top-10 |date=2011-10-19 }}," ''logler.com'' (10-Apr-2006).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fish Tycoon'' was later ported to cell phone, retail, and Nintendo DS.

== Game Storyline ==
Players take on the role of a fish store owner who must breed and care for hundreds of different kinds of exotic [[fish]], all the while attempting to keep the fish store economically viable long enough to achieve the ultimate objective: breeding The Seven Magic Fish of Isola.  The story for this game is that on the mysterious island of Isola there was a lagoon where the most magnificent fish swam. These fish were held together by the 7 magic fish but one day all of the fish have disappeared. Thus, you have to cross-breed fish to rediscover the 7 magic fish, solve the genetic puzzle,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Cohen, "[http://www.macworld.com/article/49980/2006/03/fishtycoon.html Fish Tycoon maker seeks Mac beta testers]," ''Macworld'' (Mar 21, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and "restore the island to its former glory."&lt;ref&gt;James Shiell, "[http://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?contentid=3272 Fish Tycoon review]," ''geekzone'' (30-AUG-2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Free trade''' is a [[trade policy]] that does not restrict [[imports]] or [[exports]]; it is the idea of the [[free market]] as applied to [[international trade]]. In government, free trade is predominately advocated by political parties that hold [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] or [[Liberalism|liberal]] economic positions, while economically [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] political parties generally support [[protectionism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=State Aid for Newspapers: Theories, Cases, Actions|last=Murschetz|first=Paul|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|year=2013|isbn=978-3642356902|location=|pages=64|quote=Parties of the left in government in adopt protectionist policies for ideological reasons and because they wish to save worker jobs.

Most nations are today members of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) [[multilateralism|multilateral]] trade agreements. Free trade is additionally exemplified by the [[European Economic Area]] and the [[Mercosur]], which have established [[open market]]s. However, most governments still impose some [[protectionist]] policies that are intended to support local employment, such as applying [[tariff]]s to imports or [[Subsidy|subsidies]] to exports. Governments may also restrict free trade to limit exports of natural resources. Other barriers that may hinder trade include [[import quotas]], taxes, and [[non-tariff barrier]]s, such as regulatory [[legislation]].

There is a broad consensus among economists that protectionism has a negative effect on economic growth and economic welfare, while free trade and the reduction of [[trade barrier]]s has a positive effect on economic growth.&lt;ref name="See P 1994"&gt;See P.Krugman, «The Narrow and Broad Arguments for Free Trade», American Economic Review, Papers and Proceedings, 83(3), 1993 ; and P.Krugman, Peddling Prosperity: Economic Sense and Nonsense in the Age of Diminished Expectations, New York, W.W.

==Features==
Free trade policies generally promote the following features:{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}
* Trade of [[good (economics)|goods]] without taxes (including tariffs) or other [[trade barrier]]s (e.g., quotas on imports or subsidies for producers)
* Trade in services without taxes or other trade barriers
* The absence of "trade-distorting" policies (such as taxes, subsidies, [[regulation]]s, or laws) that give some [[business entity|firms]], households, or [[factors of production]] an advantage over others
* Unregulated access to [[Market (economics)|markets]]
* Unregulated access to market information
* Inability of firms to distort markets through government-imposed [[monopoly]] or [[oligopoly]] power
* [[Trade agreement]]s which encourage free trade.

==Economics==

===Economic models===
{{details|Supply and demand}}
Two simple ways to understand the proposed benefits of free trade are through David Ricardo's theory of [[comparative advantage]] and by analyzing the impact of a tariff or import quota. An economic analysis using the law of supply and demand and the economic effects of a tax can be used to show the theoretical benefits and disadvantages of free trade.&lt;ref name = "landsburg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hartmann"&gt;[[Thom Hartmann]], ''Unequal Protection'', Second Edition, Chapter 20. p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

Most economists would recommend that even developing nations should set their tariff rates quite low, but the economist [[Ha-Joon Chang]], a proponent of industrial policy, believes higher levels may be justified in developing nations because the productivity gap between them and developed nations today is much higher than what developed nations faced when they were at a similar level of technological development. Underdeveloped nations today, Chang believes, are weak players in a much more competitive system.&lt;ref name="autogenerated311"&gt;Pugel (2007), ''International Economics'', pp. 311–312&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
|last1 = Chang
|first1 = Ha-Joon
|title = Kicking Away the Ladder: Good Policies and Good Institutions in Historical Perspective
|url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTDECINEQ/Resources/KAL-SummaryPaper.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counterarguments to Chang's point of view are that the developing countries are able to adopt technologies from abroad, whereas developed nations had to create new technologies themselves, and that developing countries can sell to export markets far richer than any that existed in the 19th century.

If the chief justification for a tariff is to stimulate infant industries, it must be high enough to allow domestic manufactured goods to compete with imported goods in order to be successful. This theory, known as [[import substitution industrialization]], is largely considered ineffective for currently developing nations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated311"/&gt;

====Tariffs====
[[File:EffectOfTariff.svg|thumb|right|upright=2.05|The pink regions are the net loss to society caused by the existence of the tariff.]]
The chart at the right analyzes the effect of the imposition of an import tariff on some imaginary good. Prior to the tariff, the price of the good in the world market (and hence in the domestic market) is P&lt;sub&gt;world&lt;/sub&gt;. The tariff increases the domestic price to P&lt;sub&gt;tariff&lt;/sub&gt;. The higher price causes domestic production to increase from Q&lt;sub&gt;S1&lt;/sub&gt; to Q&lt;sub&gt;S2&lt;/sub&gt; and causes domestic consumption to decline from Q&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; to Q&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="stockman"&gt;Alan C. Stockman, ''Introduction to Economics'', Second Edition, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mankiw"&gt;[[N. Gregory Mankiw]], ''Macroeconomics'', Fifth Edition, Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

This has three main effects on societal welfare. Consumers are made worse off because the consumer surplus (green region) becomes smaller. Producers are better off because the producer surplus (yellow region) is made larger. The government also has additional tax revenue (blue region). However, the loss to consumers is greater than the gains by producers and the government. The magnitude of this societal loss is shown by the two pink triangles. Removing the tariff and having free trade would be a net gain for society.&lt;ref name="stockman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mankiw" /&gt;

An almost identical analysis of this tariff from the perspective of a net producing country yields parallel results. From that country's perspective, the tariff leaves producers worse off and consumers better off, but the net loss to producers is larger than the benefit to consumers (there is no tax revenue in this case because the country being analyzed is not collecting the tariff). Under similar analysis, export tariffs, import quotas, and export quotas all yield nearly identical results.&lt;ref name = "landsburg"/&gt;

Sometimes consumers are better off and producers worse off, and sometimes consumers are worse off and producers are better off, but the imposition of trade restrictions causes a net loss to society because the losses from trade restrictions are larger than the gains from trade restrictions. Free trade creates winners and losers, but theory and empirical evidence show that the size of the winnings from free trade are larger than the losses.&lt;ref name = "landsburg"/&gt;

===Trade diversion===
According to [[mainstream economics|mainstream economic]] theory, the selective application of free trade agreements to some countries and tariffs on others can lead to [[efficiency (economics)|economic inefficiency]] through the process of [[trade diversion]]. It is economically efficient for a good to be produced by the country which is the lowest cost producer, but this does not always take place if a high cost producer has a free trade agreement while the low cost producer faces a high tariff. Applying free trade to the high cost producer (and not the low cost producer as well) can lead to trade diversion and a net economic loss. This is why many economists place such high importance on negotiations for global tariff reductions, such as the [[Doha Round]].&lt;ref name="landsburg"&gt;[[Steven E. Landsburg]]. ''Price Theory and Applications'', Sixth Edition, Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economist opinions===
The literature analysing the economics of free trade is extremely rich with extensive work having been done on the theoretical and empirical effects. Though it creates winners and losers, the broad consensus among economists is that free trade is a large and unambiguous net gain for society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The notion of a free trade system encompassing multiple sovereign states originated in a rudimentary form in 16th century [[Spanish Empire|Imperial Spain]].&lt;ref name="Arrighi1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Giovanni Arrighi|authorlink=Giovanni Arrighi|title=The Long Twentieth Century: Money, Power, and the Origins of Our Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cFfKtpgn4fkC|year=1994|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-85984-015-3|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; American [[jurist]] [[Arthur Nussbaum]] noted that Spanish theologian [[Francisco de Vitoria]] was "the first to set forth the notions (though not the terms) of freedom of commerce and freedom of the seas."&lt;ref name="Nussbaum1947"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Nussbaum|authorlink=Arthur Nussbaum|title=A concise history of the law of nations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxkQAQAAMAAJ|year=1947|publisher=Macmillan Co.|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitoria made the case under principles of ''[[jus gentium]]''.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum1947" /&gt; However, it was two early British economists [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]] who later developed the idea of free trade into its modern and recognizable form.

Economists who advocated free trade believed trade was the reason why certain civilizations prospered economically. Adam Smith, for example, pointed to increased trading as being the reason for the flourishing of not just [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]] cultures such as [[Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and [[Roman Empire|Rome]], but also of [[Bengal]] ([[Indian subcontinent|East India]]) and [[China]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; made the free trade/mercantilist dispute the most important question in economics for centuries. Free trade policies have battled with [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]], [[protectionism|protectionist]], [[isolationism|isolationist]], [[communism|communist]], [[populism|populist]], and other policies over the centuries.

The [[Ottoman Empire]] had [[Economic liberalism|liberal]] free trade policies by the 18th century, with origins in [[capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]], dating back to the first commercial treaties signed with France in 1536 and taken further with [[Capitulation (treaty)|capitulations]] in 1673, in 1740 which lowered [[Duty (economics)|duties]] to only 3% for imports and exports, and in 1790. Ottoman free trade policies were praised by British economists advocating free trade, such as [[J. R. McCulloch]] in his ''Dictionary of Commerce'' (1834), but criticized by British politicians opposing free trade, such as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who cited the Ottoman Empire as "an instance of the injury done by unrestrained competition" in the 1846 [[Corn Laws]] debate, arguing that it destroyed what had been "some of the finest manufactures of the world" in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=[[Paul Bairoch]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1995|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/193124153/Economics-and-World-History-Myths-and-Paradoxes-Paul-Bairoch|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Droits de douane (France, UK, US).png|thumb|Average Tariff Rates (France, UK, US)]]
Trade in [[British America|colonial America]] was regulated by the British mercantile system through the [[Acts of Trade and Navigation]]. Until the 1760s, few colonists openly advocated for free trade, in part because regulations were not strictly enforced – New England was famous for smuggling – but also because colonial merchants did not want to compete with foreign goods and shipping. According to historian Oliver Dickerson, a desire for free trade was not one of the causes of the [[American Revolution]]. "The idea that the basic mercantile practices of the eighteenth century were wrong," wrote Dickerson, "was not a part of the thinking of the Revolutionary leaders".&lt;ref&gt;Dickerson, ''The Navigation Acts and the American Revolution'', p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free trade came to what would become the United States as a result of [[American Revolutionary War]]. After the British Parliament issued the [[Prohibitory Act]], blockading colonial ports, the [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] responded by effectively declaring economic independence, opening American ports to foreign trade on April 6, 1776. According to historian John W. Tyler, "Free trade had been forced on the Americans, like it or not."&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, ''Smugglers &amp; Patriots'', p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1801 the Pope [[Pius VII]] ordered some liberalization of trade to face the economic crisis in the [[Papal States]] with the [[Motu Proprio]] "Le più colte"; despite this, the export of national corn was forbidden to ensure the food for the State.

[[File:British ships in Canton.jpg|thumb|Britain waged two [[Opium Wars]] to force China to legalize the [[opium trade]] and to open all of China to British merchants.]]
In Britain, free trade became a central principle [[Economic history of the United Kingdom#Free trade|practiced by the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846]].   Large-scale agitation was sponsored by the [[Anti-Corn Law League]].  Under the [[Treaty of Nanking]], China opened five [[treaty ports]] to world trade in 1843. The first free trade agreement, the [[Cobden-Chevalier Treaty]], was put in place in 1860 between Britain and France, which led to successive agreements between other countries in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=International Monetary Fund Research Dept.|title=World Economic Outlook, May 1997: Globalization: Opportunities and Challenges|date=1997|publisher=International Monetary Fund|isbn=9781455278886|page=113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JCOzhl3848MC&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many classical liberals, especially in 19th and early 20th century Britain (e.g. [[John Stuart Mill]]) and in the United States for much of the 20th century (e.g., [[Henry Ford]] and Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]]), believed that free trade promoted peace.  [[Woodrow Wilson]] included free-trade rhetoric in his "[[Fourteen Points]]" speech of 1918:

{{quote|The program of the world's peace, therefore, is our program; and that program, the only possible program, all we see it, is this: [...]

3. The removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and the establishment of equality of trade conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Fourteen Points Speech|Fourteen Points]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to economic historian Douglas Irwin, a common myth about U.S. trade policy is that low tariffs harmed American manufacturers in the early 19th century and then that high tariffs made the United States into a great industrial power in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21731616-douglas-irwin-agrees-trade-policy-important-all-manner-powers-are-wrongly|title=A historian on the myths of American trade|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review by the ''Economist'' of Irwin's 2017 book ''Clashing over Commerce: A History of US Trade Policy'' notes:&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Political dynamics would lead people to see a link between tariffs and the economic cycle that was not there. A boom would generate enough revenue for tariffs to fall, and when the bust came pressure would build to raise them again. By the time that happened, the economy would be recovering, giving the impression that tariff cuts caused the crash and the reverse generated the recovery. Mr Irwin also methodically debunks the idea that protectionism made America a great industrial power, a notion believed by some to offer lessons for developing countries today. As its share of global manufacturing powered from 23% in 1870 to 36% in 1913, the admittedly high tariffs of the time came with a cost, estimated at around 0.5% of GDP in the mid-1870s. In some industries, they might have sped up development by a few years. But American growth during its protectionist period was more to do with its abundant resources and openness to people and ideas.&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to [[Paul Bairoch]], since the end of the 18th century, the United States has been "the homeland and bastion of modern protectionism". In fact, the United States never adhered to free trade until 1945. For the most part, the "Jeffersonians" strongly opposed it. In the 19th century, statesmen such as Senator [[Henry Clay]] continued Hamilton's themes within the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] under the name "[[American System (economic plan)|American System]]." The opposition [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] contested several elections throughout the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s in part over the issue of the tariff and protection of industry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Larry Schweikart]], ''What Would the Founders Say?'' (New York: Sentinel, 2011), pp. 106–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the Democratic Party favored moderate tariffs used for government revenue only, while the Whigs favored higher protective tariffs to protect favored industries. The economist [[Henry Charles Carey]] became a leading proponent of the "American System" of economics. This mercantilist "American System" was opposed by the Democratic Party of [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Martin Van Buren]], [[John Tyler]], [[James K. Polk]], [[Franklin Pierce]], and [[James Buchanan]].

The fledgling [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] led by [[Abraham Lincoln]], who called himself a "Henry Clay tariff Whig", strongly opposed free trade and implemented a 44% tariff during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] – in part to pay for railroad subsidies and for the war effort, and to protect favored industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lind|first=Matthew|title=Free Trade Fallacy|url=http://www.newamerica.net/index.cfm?pg=article&amp;DocID=1080 |publisher=Prospect|accessdate=3 January 2011 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060106154801/http://www.newamerica.net/index.cfm?pg=article&amp;DocID=1080 |archivedate = 6 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[William McKinley]] (later to become President of the United States) stated the stance of the Republican Party (which won every election for President from 1868 until 1912, except the two non-consecutive terms of [[Grover Cleveland]]) as thus:

{{quote|Under free trade the trader is the master and the producer the slave. Protection is but the law of nature, the law of self-preservation, of self-development, of securing the highest and best destiny of the race of man. [It is said] that protection is immoral…. Why, if protection builds up and elevates 63,000,000 [the U.S. population] of people, the influence of those 63,000,000 of people elevates the rest of the world. We cannot take a step in the pathway of progress without benefitting mankind everywhere. Well, they say, 'Buy where you can buy the cheapest'…. Of course, that applies to labor as to everything else. Let me give you a maxim that is a thousand times better than that, and it is the protection maxim: 'Buy where you can pay the easiest.' And that spot of earth is where labor wins its highest rewards.&lt;ref&gt;William McKinley speech, October 4, 1892 in Boston, MA William McKinley Papers (Library of Congress)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the interwar period, economic [[protectionism]] took hold in the United States, most famously in the form of the [[Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act]], which is credited by economists with the prolonging and worldwide propagation of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Financial Management, 6th Edition | author = Eun, Cheol S. | author2 = Resnick, Bruce G. | year = 2011 | publisher = McGraw-Hill/Irwin | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-803465-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/steve-bannons-bad-history-1505861920|title=Steve Bannon’s Bad History|last=Irwin|first=Douglas A.|date=2017-09-19|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1934, trade liberalization began to take place through the [[Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act]].

In ''Kicking Away the Ladder'', development economist [[Ha-Joon Chang]] reviews the history of free trade policies and economic growth, and notes that many of the now-industrialized countries had significant barriers to trade throughout their history. The United States and Britain, sometimes considered the homes of free trade policy, employed protectionism to varying degrees at all times. Britain abolished the [[Corn Laws]], which restricted import of grain, in 1846 in response to domestic pressures, and it reduced protectionism for manufactures in the mid 19th century, when its technological advantage was at its height, but tariffs on manufactured products had returned to 23% by 1950. The United States maintained weighted average tariffs on manufactured products of approximately 40–50% up until the 1950s, augmented by the natural protectionism of high transportation costs in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Chang (2003), ''Kicking Away the Ladder'', p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The most consistent practitioners of free trade have been Switzerland, the Netherlands, and to a lesser degree Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Chang (2003), ''Kicking Away the Ladder'', p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Chang describes the [[export-oriented industrialization]] policies of the [[Four Asian Tigers]] as "far more sophisticated and fine-tuned than their historical equivalents".&lt;ref&gt;Chang (2003), ''Kicking Away the Ladder'', p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Some degree of protectionism is nevertheless the norm throughout the world. Most developed nations maintain controversial{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} agricultural tariffs. From 1820 to 1980, the average tariffs on manufactures in twelve industrial countries ranged from 11 to 32%. In the developing world, average tariffs on manufactured goods are approximately 34%.&lt;ref&gt;Chang (2003), ''Kicking Away the Ladder'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; The American economist [[C. Fred Bergsten]] devised the ‘bicycle theory’ to describe [[trade policy]]. According to this model trade policy is ‘dynamically unstable’, in that it constantly tends towards either liberalisation or protectionism. To prevent falling off the bike (the disadvantages of protectionism), trade policy and [[multilateral trade negotiations]] must constantly pedal towards greater liberalisation. To achieve greater liberalisation decision makers must appeal to the greater welfare for consumers and the wider national economy over narrower parochial interests. However, Bergsten also posits that it is also necessary to compensate the losers in trade and help them find new work, as this will both reduce the backlash against globalisation and the motives for trades unions and politicians to call for protection of trade.&lt;ref&gt;Destler, Mac and Noland, Marcus (July 2, 2014).

===Post-World War II===
Since the end of [[World War II]], in part due to industrial size and the onset of the Cold War, the United States has often been a proponent of reduced tariff-barriers and free trade. The U.S. helped establish the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) and later the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO); although it had rejected an earlier version in the 1950s ([[International Trade Organization]] or ITO).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/reser_e/pera9707.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Since the 1970s, U.S. governments have negotiated managed-trade agreements, such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) in the 1990s, the [[Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) in 2006, and a number of bilateral agreements (such as with Jordan).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In Europe, [[Inner Six|six countries]] formed the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) in 1951 which became the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) in 1958. Two core objectives of the EEC were the development of a common market, subsequently renamed the [[single market]], and establishing a [[customs union]] between its member states. After expanding its membership, the EEC became the [[European Union]] (EU) in 1993. The European Union, now the world's largest single market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU position in world trade|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/eu-position-in-world-trade/|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; has [[European Union free trade agreements|concluded free trade agreements]] with many countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agreements|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/agreements/|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
The relative [[social cost|costs]], benefits and beneficiaries of free trade are debated by academics, governments and interest groups.

Arguments for protectionism fall into the economic category (trade hurts the economy or groups in the economy) or the moral category (the effects of trade might help the economy, but have ill effects in other areas); a general argument against free trade is that it is [[colonialism]] or [[imperialism]] in disguise. The moral category is wide, including concerns of destroying infant industries and undermining long-run economic development, [[income inequality]], [[environmental degradation]], supporting [[child labor]] and [[sweatshops]], [[race to the bottom]], [[wage slavery]], accentuating poverty in poor countries, harming [[Defense (military)|national defense]], and forcing [[cultural change]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald J. Boudreaux|Boudreaux, Don]] ''Globalization'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2017}}

Economic arguments against free trade criticize the assumptions or conclusions of economic theories. Sociopolitical arguments against free trade cite social and political effects that economic arguments do not capture, such as political stability, national security, human rights and environmental protection.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Free trade is often opposed by domestic industries that would have their profits and market share reduced by lower prices for imported goods.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Baumol]] and [[Alan Blinder]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=NNRU3b_tE7cC&amp;pg=PA761#PPA722,M1 Economics: Principles and Policy], p. 722.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='brakman'&gt;{{Cite book| last = Brakman | first = Steven | authorlink = |author2=Harry Garretsen |author3=Charles Van Marrewijk |author4=Arjen Van Witteloostuijn  | title = Nations and Firms in the Global Economy : An Introduction to International Economics and Business | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2006 | location = Cambridge | pages = | url = | doi = | isbn = 978-0-521-83298-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if United States tariffs on imported sugar were reduced, U.S. sugar producers would receive lower prices and profits, while U.S. sugar consumers would spend less for the same amount of sugar because of those same lower prices. The economic theory of [[David Ricardo]] holds that consumers would necessarily gain more than producers would lose.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard L. Stroup]], James D. Gwartney, Russell S.

Socialists frequently oppose free trade on the ground that it allows maximum [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of [[Labor movement|workers]] by [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. For example, [[Karl Marx]] wrote in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', "The bourgeoisie... has set up that single, unconscionable freedom – free trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation." Nonetheless, Marx did favor free trade – ''solely'' because he felt that it would hasten the social revolution.&lt;ref&gt;"It is in this revolutionary sense ''alone'', gentlemen, that I vote in favor of free trade." Marx, Karl [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/01/09ft.htm#marx On the Question of Free Trade] Speech to the Democratic Association of Brussels at its public meeting of January 9, 1848&lt;/ref&gt;

"Free trade" is opposed by many anti-globalization groups, based on their assertion that free trade agreements generally do not increase the [[economic freedom]] of the poor or the working class, and frequently make them poorer. Where the foreign supplier allows de facto exploitation of labor, domestic free-labor is unfairly forced to compete with the foreign exploited labor. To this extent, free trade is seen as an end-run around workers' rights and laws that protect individual liberty.

Some opponents of free trade favor free trade theory but oppose free trade ''agreements'' as applied. Some opponents of NAFTA see the agreement as being materially harmful to the common people, but some of the arguments are actually against the particulars of government-managed trade, rather than against free trade ''per se''. For example, it is argued that it would be wrong to let subsidized corn from the U.S. into Mexico freely under NAFTA at prices well below production cost ([[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]]) because of its ruinous effects to Mexican farmers. Of course, such subsidies violate free trade theory, so this argument is not actually against the principle of free trade, but rather its selective implementation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Research shows that support for trade restrictions is highest among respondents with the lowest levels of education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Learning to Love Globalization: Education and Individual Attitudes Toward International Trade|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0020818306060140|journal = International Organization|date = 2006-04-01|issn = 1531-5088|pages = 469–498|volume = 60|issue = 02|doi = 10.1017/S0020818306060140|first = Jens|last = Hainmueller|first2 = Michael J.|last2 = Hiscox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors find "that the impact of education on how voters think about trade and globalization has more to do with exposure to economic ideas and information about the aggregate and varied effects of these economic phenomena, than it does with individual calculations about how trade affects personal income or job security.

===Colonialism===
{{details|Dependency theory}}
It has long been argued that free trade is a form of colonialism or imperialism, a position taken by various proponents of [[economic nationalism]] and the school of mercantilism. In the 19th century these criticized British calls for free trade as cover for [[British Empire]], notably in the works of American [[Henry Clay]], architect of the [[American System (economic plan)|American System]]&lt;ref&gt;"Gentlemen deceive themselves. It is not free trade that they are recommending to our acceptance. It is, in effect, the British colonial system that we are invited to adopt; and, if their policy prevail, it will lead, substantially, to the recolonization of these States, under the commercial dominion of Great Britain.", "In Defense of the American System, Against the British Colonial System." 1832, Feb 2, 3, and 6, {{Cite journal| title = The Life and Speeches of Henry Clay | volume = II | first = Henry | last = Clay | year = 1843 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Biyh3OmxhOMC&amp;pg=PA23 |pages= 23–24 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[German American]] economist [[Friedrich List]].&lt;ref&gt;"Had the English left everything to itself – '[[Laissez faire]], laissez aller', as the popular economical school recommends – the [German] merchants of the [[Steelyard]] would be still carrying on their trade in London, the Belgians would be still manufacturing cloth for the English, England would have still continued to be the sheep-farm of the [[Hanseatic League|Hansards]], just as Portugal became the vineyard of England, and has remained so till our days, owing to the stratagem of a cunning diplomatist."&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Ecuadorian President [[Rafael Correa]] has denounced the "sophistry of free trade" in an introduction he wrote for a book titled ''The Hidden Face of Free Trade Accords'', written in part by Correa's current Energy Minister Alberto Acosta. Citing as his source the book [http://www.paecon.net/PAEtexts/Chang1.htm ''Kicking Away the Ladder''], written by [[Ha-Joon Chang]], Correa identified the difference between an "American system" opposed to a "British System" of free trade. The latter, he says, was explicitly viewed by the Americans as "part of the British imperialist system." According to Correa, Chang showed that it was Treasury Secretary [[Alexander Hamilton]], and not [[Friedrich List]], who was the first to present a systematic argument defending industrial protectionism.

==Alternatives==
The following alternatives for free trade have been proposed: [[balanced trade]], [[fair trade]], [[protectionism]], [[industrial policy]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==In literature==
The value of free trade was first observed and documented by [[Adam Smith]] in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Bhagwati (2002), ''Free Trade Today'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote,
{{quote|It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy.... If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'', pp. 264–265&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This statement uses the concept of [[absolute advantage]] to present an argument in opposition to [[mercantilism]], the dominant view surrounding trade at the time, which held that a country should aim to export more than it imports, and thus amass wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Pugel (2007), ''International Economics'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Smith argues, countries could gain from each producing exclusively the good(s) in which they are most suited to, trading between each other as required for the purposes of consumption. In this vein, it is not the value of exports relative to that of imports that is important, but the value of the goods produced by a nation. The concept of absolute advantage however does not address a situation where a country has no advantage in the production of a particular good or type of good.&lt;ref&gt;Pugel (2007), ''International Economics'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

This theoretical shortcoming was addressed by the theory of comparative advantage. Generally attributed to [[David Ricardo]] who expanded on it in his 1817 book ''[[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo (1817), ''On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'', Chapter 7 "On Foreign Trade"&lt;/ref&gt; it makes a case for free trade based not on absolute advantage in production of a good, but on the relative [[opportunity cost]]s of production. A country should specialize in whatever good it can produce at the lowest cost, trading this good to buy other goods it requires for consumption. This allows for countries to benefit from trade even when they do not have an absolute advantage in any area of production. While their gains from trade might not be equal to those of a country more productive in all goods, they will still be better off economically from trade than they would be under a state of [[autarky]].
&lt;ref&gt;Bhagwati (2002), ''Free Trade Today'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pugel (2007), ''International Economics'', pp. 35–38, 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptionally, [[Henry George]]'s 1886 book ''[[Protection or Free Trade]]'' was read out loud in full into the [[Congressional Record]] by five Democratic congressmen.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, "A Fragile Alliance," 425–425&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry George, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7qlMAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=protection%20or%20free%20trade ''Protection or Free Trade: An Examination of the Tariff Question, with Especial Regard to the Interests of Labor](New York: 1887).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Tyler Cowen]] wrote that '[[Protection or Free Trade]]'' "remains perhaps the best-argued tract on free trade to this day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cowen|first1=Tyler|title=Anti-Capitalist Rerun|journal=The American Interest|date=May 1, 2009|volume= 4|issue= 5|url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/2009/05/01/anti-capitalist-rerun/|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
George discusses the subject in particular with respect to the interests of labor. Although George is very critical towards protectionism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We all hear with interest and pleasure of improvements in transportation by water or land; we are all disposed to regard the opening of canals, the building of railways, the deepening of harbors, the improvement of steamships as beneficial. But if such things are beneficial, how can tariffs be beneficial? The effect of such things is to lessen the cost of transporting commodities; the effect of tariffs is to increase it. If the protective theory be true, every improvement that cheapens the carriage of goods between country and country is an injury to mankind unless tariffs be commensurately increased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truefreetrade.org/pft3.htm "True Free Trade", Chapter 3, ''Protection or Free Trade'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; George considers the general free trade argument 'inadequate'. He argues that the removal of protective tariffs alone is never sufficient to improve the situation of the working class, unless accompanied by a shift towards [[land value tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truefreetrade.org/pft16.htm|title=Protection or Free Trade - Chapter 16|website=www.truefreetrade.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with Jacob Zuma ==

The slogan "#Not My President" on the placard explicitly links Atul Gupta with President Zuma.]]
The Guptas and then vice-president Zuma first met at a function hosted by the Guptas at Sahara Estate in 2003.  Since then the family have been involved in a number of events involving Zuma and his family. The family is known to have been a supporter of Zuma during his power struggle for leadership of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) with then president [[Thabo Mbeki]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="rdmRussia" /&gt;

The family is known to have employed Zuma's wife Bongi Ngema-Zuma. One of Zuma's sons, Duduzane Zuma was a director in a number of Gupta owned firms and one of his daughters, Duduzile Zuma, was made a director of the Gupta owned Sahara computers in 2008. She has since resigned from that position.&lt;ref name="bbcGupta" /&gt; Duduzane Zuma has also since resigned from all positions held at Gupta owned businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=le Cordeur |first=Matthew |date=8 April 2016 |title=Guptas and Duduzane Zuma resign from Oakbay |url=http://www.fin24.com/Economy/breaking-guptas-resign-from-oakbay-20160408 |newspaper=fin24.com |location=Cape Town |access-date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuma's close relationship with the family is a source of tension within Zuma's own party the ANC.&lt;ref name="rdmAllies"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rdm.co.za/politics/2016/02/01/zuma-allies-break-ranks-with-him-over-guptas | title=Zuma allies 'break ranks' with him over Guptas | publisher=Rand Daily Mail | date=1 February 2016 | accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Zuma denies granting undue influence to the family.&lt;ref name="reuters3-11-16"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=South Africa's Guptas to challenge influence-peddling report at inquiry |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/safrica-zuma-idINKBN12Y0JK |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |location= |date=3 November 2016 |access-date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zupta ===
A reflection of the close relationship between the Gupta family and Jacob Zuma, particularly by both Zuma and the family's detractors, is the term "Zupta" to refer to this relationship. The [[portmanteau]], a combination of "Z" from "Zuma" and the "upta" from "Gupta", was first coined by the [[Economic Freedom Fighters]] at the 2016 South African presidential state of the nation address when they disrupted the event by repeatedly chanting "Zupta must fall" to express their dissatisfaction with this relationship.&lt;ref name="New24Zupta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/zupta-must-fall-and-eff-walks-out-20160211|title='Zupta must fall' – and EFF walks out|date=11 February 2016|publisher=[[News24]]|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bdayZupta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/2016/02/11/chaos-as-eff-once-again-delays-speech-and-then-stages-walkout|title=Chaos as EFF once again delays speech and then stages walkout|date=11 February 2016|publisher=Business Day|accessdate=14 February 2016|author1=Hartley, Wyndham|author2=Marrian, Natasha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== “Guptagate” wedding controversy ===
[[File:SAAF-Puma-001.jpg|thumb|Waterkloof Air Force Base where the Jet Airways plane landed in April 2013, sparking the Guptagate controversy]]
On 30 April 2013, an Airbus A330-200 chartered aircraft run by Jet Airways carrying 217 guests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/who-was-on-the-gupta-wedding-plane-1508887 |title=Who was on the Gupta wedding plane? |date=1 May 2013 |first=Peter |last=Fabricius |website=[[IOL News]] |accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; from India was cleared to land at the South African Air Force [[Air Force Base Waterkloof|base at Waterkloof]] for the wedding ceremony of Vega Gupta to Aakash Jahajgarhia at [[Sun City, North West]]. This event caused a significant controversy that led to the African National Congress (ANC) and other political parties as well as the [[South African National Defence Union]] to denounce this use of the air force base.  The ANC issued a statement calling for "those responsible for giving the family permission to come into the country without going through the normal channels be 'brought to book'".&lt;ref name="bbcGupta" /&gt;&lt;ref name="encaAir"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.enca.com/south-africa/guptas-use-waterkloof-airforce-base-private-landing-strip | title=Guptas use Waterkloof airforce base as private landing strip | publisher=[[eNCA]] | date=30 April 2013 | accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the event, India's High Commissioner Virendra Gupta (not related to the Gupta family) said publicly that the Indian High Commission was given permission to land the plane at Waterkloof Air Force Base.&lt;ref name=IOL090516&gt;{{cite news |last=Areff |first=Ahmed  |date=9 May 2013 |title=Gupta jet landing cleared: commissioner |url=http://mini.iol.co.za/news/politics/gupta-jet-landing-cleared-commissioner-1513372 |newspaper=Independent Online |location= |access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that the Commission communicated through its defence adviser with the chief of defence for foreign relations in the [[SA National Defence Force]] (SANDF).&lt;ref name=IOL090516/&gt;

The landing was cleared by Bruce Koloane who was chief of state protocol at the [[Department of International Relations and Cooperation|department of international relations]] who insisted that the flight was a “sensitive” official visit. Koloane was demoted after an investigation concluded that he used Zuma's name to illegally authorise the landing.  President Zuma was scheduled to attend the wedding but cancelled after the incident became public.&lt;ref name="mgGuptaFlight"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mg.co.za/article/2015-02-05-guptas-never-heard-of-them | title='Guptas?

The incident prompted a significant outcry, so much so that it was dubbed "Guptagate" by the [[South African media]].&lt;ref name="Symbol" /&gt;

In 2017, it was revealed that the wedding was paid for by funds, laundered through Dubai, and granted to a Gupta-linked company by the [[Free State Province]] government, purportedly as part of the [[Vrede Dairy Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/guptaleaks-the-dubai-laundromat-how-millions-milked-from-free-state-government-paid-for-sun-city-wedding-20170629 |title=#GuptaLeaks: The Dubai Laundromat – How millions milked from Free State government paid for Sun City wedding |date=30 June 2017 |website=[[News24]] |access-date=19 February 2018}}]&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2018, the Asset Forfeiture Unit of the [[National Prosecuting Authority]] seized R220 million that Free State Department of Agriculture under [[Mosebenzi Zwane]] had paid to the Gupta family as part of this project, calling it a "scheme designed to defraud and steal monies from the department".&lt;ref name="seized"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/breaking-npa-freezes-r220m-land-linked-to-gupta-farm-20180120|title=NPA freezes R220m, land linked to Gupta farm|date=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Hawks (South Africa)|Hawks]] unit of South Africa's Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) raided the offices of [[Ace Magashule]], the Premier of the Free State, in connection with the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ewn.co.za/2018/01/26/hawks-raid-fs-premier-s-office-over-gupta-linked-vrede-dairy|title=Hawks Raid FS Premier's Office Over Gupta-linked Vrede Dairy Farm|first=Barry|last=Bateman|date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence over Cabinet appointments===
In 2016, a series of allegations of the Guptas' influence over appointments to the South African Cabinet came to the fore. Former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor claimed that in 2010 the Guptas had offered her the position of Minister of Public Enterprises, provided that she arranged for [[South African Airways]] to drop their India route, allowing a Gupta linked company (Jet Airways) to take on the route.&lt;ref name="JetAirways" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mentor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2016/03/18/Zuma-said-its-OK-Ntombazana-says-former-ANC-MP-Vytjie-Mentor|title='Zuma said it's OK Ntombazana,' says former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor|publisher=Times Live|date=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said she declined the offer, which occurred at the Guptas' Saxonwold residence, while President Zuma was in another room. This came a few days before a cabinet reshuffle in which minister [[Barbara Hogan]] was dismissed by Zuma. The Gupta family denied that the meeting took place and denied offering Vytijie a ministerial position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Khoza |first=Amanda  |date=15 March 2016 |title=Gupta family denies offering former ANC MP top job |url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/gupta-family-denies-offering-former-anc-mp-top-job-20160315 |newspaper=news24 |location= |access-date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Zuma claimed that he had no recollection of Vytjie Mentor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Khoza |first1=Amanda |last2=Tandwa |first2=Lizeka  |date=15 March 2016  |title=Zuma has 'no recollection' of Mentor - Presidency |url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/zuma-has-no-recollection-of-mentor-presidency-20160315 |newspaper=news24 |location= |access-date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deputy Finance Minister [[Mcebisi Jonas]] confirmed media reports that he had been offered the ministerial position by the Guptas shortly before the disastrous dismissal of Finance Minister [[Nhlanhla Nene]] in December 2015, but had rejected the offer out of hand as "it makes a mockery of our hard-earned democracy‚ the trust of our people and no one apart from the President of the Republic appoints ministers".&lt;ref name="Jonas"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2016/03/16/full-statement-by-deputy-finance-minister-mcebisi-jonas-on-gupta-job-offer|title=Full statement by Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas on Gupta job offer|date=16 March 2016|publisher=The Sowetan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gupta family denied offering Jonas the job of Finance Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Gupta family denies offering Jonas South Africa's finance minister role |url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKCN0WI2J7 |newspaper=Reuters |location= |date=16 March 2016 |access-date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sunday Times (South Africa)|Sunday Times]] has reported that the Minister of Mineral Resources, Mosebenzi Zwane, and then Minister of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, [[David van Rooyen]] (who was controversially appointed by President Zuma as Minister of Finance in December 2015) met with members of the Gupta family in [[Dubai]].  Van Rooyen allegedly met with them only a few days after his unsuccessful appointment to be Minister of Finance on the 20 December 2015.  Minister Zwane assisted in the sale of a large coal mine to a Gupta owned company.&lt;ref name="STguptaTrips"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/stnews/2016/04/10/Gupta-ministers-in-secret-trips-to-Dubai1 | title='Gupta ministers' in secret trips to Dubai | publisher=Sunday Times | date=10 April 2016 | accessdate=10 April 2016 |author1=Jika, Thanduxolo  |author2=Hunter, Qaanitah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former bodyguards of the Gupta family have stated that they often saw important government officials, such as [[Hlaudi Motsoeneng]] the COO of the state broadcaster the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation|SABC]], and large amounts of money in cash moving out of the Gupta's Saxonwold estate.  The bodyguards also stated that Ajay Gupta would visit President Zuma up to three times a week until 2015 at the presidential guest house in Pretoria.  A spokesperson for president Zuma denies that the visits ever happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2016-04-28-what-the-gupta-guards-saw|title=What the Gupta guards saw: VIPs and bags of cash|last=Bezuidenhout|first=Jessica|website=The M&amp;G Online|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranjeni Munusamy of the [[Daily Maverick]] has stated the "Gupta family has effectively usurped the function of the ANC deployment committee"&lt;ref name="DMzuptaChamber"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-03-17-zupta-chamber-of-secrets-blown-open-tide-turns-in-anc | title=Zupta chamber of secrets blown open: Tide turns in ANC | publisher=[[Daily Maverick]] | date=17 March 2016 | accessdate=19 March 2016 | author=Munusamy, Ranjeni}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby undermining the party's ability to independently and legitimately select senior ministers and executives in government and state owned companies.&lt;ref name="RDMwhoisrunning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DMzuptaChamber" /&gt;

The Gupta's alleged influence was the subject of an investigation into "state capture" by outgoing [[Public Protector (South Africa)|Public Protector]] [[Thuli Madonsela]]. President Zuma and Minister Des van Rooyen applied for an interdict to prevent the publication of the report on 14 October 2016, Madonsela's last day in office.&lt;ref name=statecapture&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.enca.com/south-africa/zuma-interdicts-madonselas-state-capture-report|title=Zuma halts Madonsela's state capture report|date=13 October 2016|publisher=eNCA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Rooyen's application was dismissed, and the President withdrew his application, leading to the release of the report on 2 November. The report recommends the establishment of a judicial commission of enquiry into the issues identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ewn.co.za/2016/11/03/madonsela-broadens-investigating-scope-of-future-judicial-commission-of-inquiry|title=State Capture Report: What Madonsela Wants Inquiry to Probe|publisher=EWN|date=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report recommends that a full probe of Mr. Zuma's dealings with the Guptas should be conducted by a commission of inquiry, with the findings published within 180 days. Zuma and Des van Rooyen have since denied any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Parkinson |first1=Joe |last2=Steinhauser |first2=Gabriele |date=6 November 2016 |title=South Africa report cites ‘worrying’ signs of government corruption |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/thousands-join-antigovernment-protests-in-south-africa-1478079209 |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |location= |access-date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 November 2016, Zuma announced that the Presidency would be reviewing the contents of the state capture report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://city-press.news24.com/News/zuma-to-take-state-capture-report-on-review-20161125|title=Zuma to take state capture report on review|newspaper=CityPress|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said it "was done in a funny way" with "no fairness at all" and argued he was not given enough time to respond to the public protector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://citizen.co.za/news/news-national/1357691/zuma-take-madonselas-state-capture-report-review/|title=Zuma to launch a review on Madonsela's state capture report|last=Williams|first=Denise|newspaper=The Citizen|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late May 2017 a number of emails were leaked to the public from the Guptas and their associates implicating them in efforts to appoint government ministers and heads of government owned companies in addition to coordinating activities with political figures associated with President Zuma for their own personal gain.  Most notable were efforts to appoint Gupta friendly executives for [[Transnet]], [[Eskom]], the appointment of Mosebenzi Zwane as [[Minister of Mineral Resources (South Africa)|minister of mineral resources]].&lt;ref name="ministers"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/stnews/2017/05/28/Here-they-are-The-emails-that-prove-the-Guptas-run-South-Africa|title=Here they are: The emails that prove the Guptas run South Africa|last=Staff Reporter|first=|date=2017-05-28|website=Sunday Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170528133921/http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/stnews/2017/05/28/Here-they-are-The-emails-that-prove-the-Guptas-run-South-Africa|archive-date=2017-05-28|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://businesstech.co.za/news/government/178067/this-is-the-action-that-must-be-taken-on-gupta-emails-legal-expert/|title=This is the action that must be taken on Gupta emails – legal expert|last=|first=|date=7 June 2017|work=Business Tech|access-date=2017-06-07|language=en-ZA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[African National Congress Youth League|ANC Youth League]] and the pro-Gupta&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-05-16-black-first-land-first-the-black-agenda-is-upon-us/|title=Black First Land First: The Black Agenda is upon us {{!}} Daily Maverick|last=Simelane|first=Bheki|date=16 May 2016|website=www.dailymaverick.co.za|language=en|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; political party [[Black First Land First]] (BLF) disputed the authenticity of the emails whilst the Communist Party of South Africa stated that the emails "look genuine".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://citizen.co.za/news/news-national/1532929/gupta-e-mails-genuine-sacp/|title=Gupta emails ‘genuine’ – SACP|last=|first=|date=|work=The Citizen|access-date=2017-06-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, Ramaphosa announced that there would indeed be a [[Commission of Inquiry into State Capture]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sastatecapture.org.za/site/about/mandate&lt;/ref&gt;, and this would be chaired by [[Deputy Chief Justice of South Africa]] [[Raymond Zondo]]. Hearings began on 20th August, 2018&lt;ref&gt;https://www.corruptionwatch.org.za/state-capture-commission-almost-running/&lt;/ref&gt;, and are expected to last for two years.

===Mining and energy interests===
Oakbay Resources &amp; Energy is a mining and processing company run by the Gupta family.&lt;ref name=WSJOakbay&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quotes.wsj.com/ZA/XJSE/ORL/company-people |title=Oakbay Resources &amp; Energy Ltd |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Wall Street Journal |publisher= |access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It supplies minerals and mineral products, such as gold, uranium, platinum, coal and diamonds and also conducts trackless/mechanised mining, track bound mining, breast mining, down-dip mining and open-pit gold operation.&lt;ref name=WSJOakbay/&gt; Oakbay Resources &amp; Energy began trading on the JSE on 28 November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Crowley |first=Kevin  |date=1 December 2014 |title=Oakbay’s value close to top mining firm |url=http://www.iol.co.za/business/news/oakbays-value-close-to-top-mining-firm-1788584 |newspaper=Independent Online |location= |access-date=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iron ore dispute====
In 2010 the Gupta owned firm Imperial Crown Trading (ICT), along with Duduzane Zuma who was a part owner in ICT, were involved in a dispute with [[ArcelorMittal]] and [[Anglo American plc]] over the rightful ownership of [[Kumba Iron Ore]], which owns [[Sishen mine]], one of Africa's largest iron mines. The Department of Mineral Resources granted the ICT 21.4% ownership in the mine when ArcelorMittal did not renew their mining licence in time.  The case was taken to the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] where, in 2013, it was ruled that the Gupta/Zuma consortium could not claim rightful ownership.  Had they won the case ArcelorMittal would have had to pay them R800 million (US$80 million).&lt;ref name="Symbol" /&gt;&lt;ref name="biznewsKumba"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biznews.com/interviews/2013/12/12/huge-relief-as-constitutional-court-rules-for-kumba-sends-gupta-owned-ict-packing/ | title="Huge relief" as Constitutional Court rules for Kumba, sends Gupta-owned ICT packing – victory for SA’s independent judiciary | publisher=Biznews | date=12 December 2013 | accessdate=13 February 2016 |author1=Brigid Taylor |author2=Alec Hogg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coal====

====Uranium interests, Nhlanhla Nene, Pravin Gordhan and KPMG====
{{see also| Jacob Zuma#Dismissal of Nhlanhla Nene|KPMG#2017 South African corruption scandal}}
The family is alleged by the [[Rand Daily Mail]] to have worked closely with Zuma to secure interests in South Africa's nuclear energy sector.&lt;ref name="rdmRussia" /&gt;  In 2014 the South African government announced that a 9 600 MW nuclear procurement programme that entailed the construction of six to eight nuclear reactors at an estimated cost of between R800 billion to R1.6 trillion (US$50-billion to US$100 billion) was under consideration.  This proposal was approved by the Zuma cabinet on the 9 December 2015.  Zuma's [[Jacob Zuma#Dismissal of Nhlanhla Nene|controversial dismissal]] of then minister of finance [[Nhlanhla Nene]] on the 9 December 2015 is alleged to have been partially motivated by Nene's department's resistance to the nuclear agreement.&lt;ref name="rdmRussia" /&gt; President Zuma stated that this move was motivated by Nene's nomination to head the African Regional Centre of the New Development Bank/Brics Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Singh |first=Kaveel  |date=12 December 2015 |title=Zuma explains Nhlanhla Nene’s removal |url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/2015/12/12/zuma-explains-nhlanhla-nenes-removal |newspaper=Business Day Live |location= |access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zuma's statement was met with skepticism by the media and opposition political parties, partly because Nene was unaware of his nomination to the post.&lt;ref name="bdayNene"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/2016/01/12/nene-merely-a-nominee-for-brics-bank-africa-position | title=Nene merely a nominee for Brics bank Africa position | publisher=Business Day | date=12 January 2016 | accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftNene"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2a49965e-a281-11e5-8d70-42b68cfae6e4.html#axzz41Gb1Aylz | title=South Africa’s Zuma counts cost of fiasco over finance minister | publisher=Financial Times | date=14 December 2016 | accessdate=26 February 2016 | author=Andrew England | subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="n24Nene"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/maimane-slams-zuma-over-nene-brics-move-20151211 | title=Maimane slams Zuma over Nene Brics move | publisher=News24 | date=11 December 2015 | accessdate=26 February 2016 | author=Kaveel Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReasonsNene"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/four-possible-reasons-why-nene-was-fired-20151210 | title=Four possible reasons why Nene was fired | publisher=[[News24]] | date=10 December 2015 | accessdate=2 January 2016 | author=Areff, Ahmed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Biztech"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://businesstech.co.za/news/government/106705/why-zuma-sacked-nene-according-to-the-eff-and-da/ | title=Why Zuma sacked Nene according to the EFF and DA | publisher=Businesstech.co.za | date=9 December 2015 | accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nene was briefly replaced with the little known [[David van Rooyen]] before public criticism, and a sharp decline in the currency, and the stock market lead to Zuma re-appointing former minister of finance [[Pravin Gordhan]] to the position instead.

==== Power plants ====
The Gupta family was implicated in the alleged improper awarding of a contract to install a new [[Boiler (power generation)|boiler]] at the [[Duvha Power Station]] to [[Dongfang Electric]] after the Gupta connected advisory firm Trillian gave the Dongfang bid the go ahead. [[General Electric]] filed court papers stating that Dongfang was given the contract through a rigged tendering process by Eskom even though the Dongfang bid was R1 billion (US$76 million) more than the General Electric bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/companies/energy/2017-04-26-ge-claims-eskom-favoured-trillion-bid/|title=GE claims Eskom favoured Chinese firm's bid, with backing of Trillian|last=STEPHAN HOFSTATTER AND CAROL PATON|first=|date=26 April 2017|work=Business Day|access-date=2017-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427004129/https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/companies/energy/2017-04-26-ge-claims-eskom-favoured-trillion-bid/|archive-date=2017-04-27|dead-url=yes|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Railways ===
The Gupta family along with Duduzane Zuma have been implicated in an attempt to improperly influence the awarding of a R51 billion (roughly equivalent to US$6 billion in 2012) contract to deliver 600 trains to South Africa on behalf of the [[CSR Corporation Limited|China South Rail]] company.  In 2012 the former head of the South African [[Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa|Passenger Rail Agency]] (Prasa), Lucky Montana, wrote a letter detailing an attempt by the Guptas and Zuma to pressure then South African minister of transport, [[Ben Martins]], and Montana, Prasa’s then CEO, to favour China South Rail.  The letter became public in June 2016 when Montana sent a copy to the [[amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amabhungane.co.za/article/2016-06-19-guptas-r51bn-train-grab|title=amaBhungane - Guptas' R51bn train grab|website=amabhungane.co.za|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/stnews/investigations/2016/06/19/The-Guptas-R51bn-train-grab|title=The Guptas' R51bn train grab|last=SOLE|first=STEFAANS BRÜMMER and SAM|website=Sunday Times|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|SAP SE#South African allegations}}
In July 2017, [[SAP SE|SAP]] was accused of having paid CAD House, a Gupta-controlled company, R100 million in order to secure a [[Transnet]] deal in 2015. SAP denied the allegations, claiming that the money was paid as "an extension of the sales force", despite CAD House having no prior SAP experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/guptaleaks-software-giant-paid-gupta-front-r100m-kickbacks-for-state-business-20170711|title=#GuptaLeaks: Software giant paid Gupta front R100m 'kickbacks' for state business|work=News24|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amabhungane.co.za/article/2017-07-11-guptaleaks-software-giant-sap-paid-gupta-front-r100m-kickbacks-for-state-business|title=amaBhungane - #GuptaLeaks: Software giant SAP paid Gupta front R100m "kickbacks" for state business|website=amabhungane.co.za|language=en|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of the allegations, SAP suspended some managers, and launched an investigation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d8d693c0-67d8-11e7-8526-7b38dcaef614|title=Germany’s SAP to investigate South Africa kickback allegations|last=|first=|date=|website=Financial Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; appointing an acting managing director for Africa while the investigation continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=163367|title=SAP names Kuehnemann as acting MD|last=Writer|first=Staff|work=ITWeb Technology News|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VR Laser Services, in which the Guptas and Duduzane Zuma, President Zuma's son, own a 25% stake, entered into a partnership with the state owned aerospace and defence company [[Denel]] to establish Denel Asia, based in Hong Kong. The official opposition, [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] have alleged that the establishment of the joint venture is illegal as certain provisions of the Public Finance Management Act have not been complied with. The [[Minister of Public Enterprises]], [[Lynne Brown]], confirmed that the Asian marketing arm of Denel was not in compliance with various legal provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=42373:denel-asia-could-be-unlawful&amp;catid=7:Industry&amp;Itemid=116 |title=Denel Asia could be unlawful |publisher=defenceWeb |date=2016-02-17 |accessdate=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Carol Paton |url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/2016/02/16/denel-and-gupta-venture-illegal |title=Denel and Gupta venture ‘illegal’ &amp;#124; National |publisher=BDlive |date=2016-02-16 |accessdate=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
The international news broadcaster [[Al Jazeera English]] has alleged that Zuma's close relationship with the Guptas has "translated into friendly coverage in the outlets they own,"&lt;ref name="AlJazeeraReport"&gt;{{cite AV media | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyM0jjlmLrI | title=Jacob Zuma's friends and foes in South Africa's media - The Listening Post (Feature) | publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]: English | date=20 March 2016 | medium=Video | location=0:40}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically ANN7 and the New Age.

==== Economic Freedom Fighters criticism ====
On 4 February 2016 [[Julius Malema]] of the [[Economic Freedom Fighters]] (EFF) announced that members of the press from Gupta owned media companies, ANN7 and The New Age, would no longer be welcome at future EFF media announcements. The EFF alleged that this was because of their role as being part of a "propaganda machinery" of a "corrupt cartel".  He stated that the EFF "cannot guarantee the safety of those who are working in those studios and printing factories of the New Age and ANN7."&lt;ref name="citizenMedia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://citizen.co.za/977891/juju-outburst-reviled/ | title=Juju outburst reviled | publisher=[[The Citizen (South Africa)|The Citizen]] | date=5 February 2016 | accessdate=9 February 2016 |author1=Yadhana Jadoo |author2=Steven Tau |author3=Travis Carlyle }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mgJZ"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mg.co.za/article/2016-02-04-malema-refuses-to-settle-with-crook-zuma | title=Malema refuses 'crook' Zuma's offer, calls for Guptas to leave SA | publisher=[[Mail and Guardian]] | date=4 February 2016 | accessdate=11 February 2016 | author=Quintal, Genevieve}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EFF criticised the "New Age Breakfasts", a series of breakfast events organised by The New Age with and often paid for by government departments, as well as accused the paper of receiving preferential treatment in receiving advertising contracts from government.&lt;ref name="bustechMedia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://businesstech.co.za/news/government/111769/eff-slams-zuma-and-gupta-criminal-enterprises/ | title=EFF slams Zuma and Gupta "criminal enterprises" | publisher=Business Tech | date=8 February 2016 | accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson for the African National Congress defended the Gupta family, stressing their history of investment in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= Jesse Duarte |date=10 February 2016 |title= Jesse Duarte on President Zuma's relationship with the Guptas |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7Hh1Y51m-o |medium= |language= |publisher= |location= |accessdate=18 February 2016 |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later the EFF released a list of 25 reasons why they are against the family, again accusing them of receiving preferential treatment in business dealings with government as well as government preference and collusion with Gupta owned media interests.&lt;ref name="EFF24"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politics/25-reasons-why-the-guptas-must-leave-sa--eff | title=25 reasons why the Guptas must leave SA – EFF | publisher=Economic Freedom Fighters | date=10 February 2016 | accessdate=11 February 2016 | author=Mbuyiseni Quintin Ndlozi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EFF's perceived threats towards ANN7 and New Age employees caused a number of other media commentators and publications to criticise Malema's remarks as threatening [[media independence]] and advocating violence towards the media and a particularly strong rebuke from the New Age and ANN7.&lt;ref name="new24Media"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/the-new-age-ann7-editor-slams-malemas-utterances-and-threats-20160204 | title=The New Age, ANN7 editor slams Malema's 'utterances and threats' | publisher=[[News24]] | date=4 February 2016 | accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DMmedia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-02-04-editorial-nothing-justifies-threats-against-journalists/ | title=Editorial: Nothing justifies threats against journalists | publisher=[[Daily Maverick]] | date=4 February 2016 | accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An anti-gag order disallowing the EFF from banning The New Age and ANN7 from EFF media briefings was issued by the High Court following Malema's remarks.&lt;ref name="GuptaGag"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/why-judge-granted-gupta-gag-order-1984052 | title=Why judge granted Gupta gag order | publisher=[[Pretoria News]] | date=13 February 2016 | accessdate=13 February 2016 | author=Zelda Venter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court also upheld the applicants’ rights and those of the Gupta family as South African citizens to remain in South Africa and carry out business operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Gupta family win court interdict against EFF‚ Julius Malema |url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2016/02/09/Gupta-family-win-court-interdict-against-EFF%E2%80%9A-Julius-Malema |newspaper=Business Day Live |location= |date=9 February 2016 |access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge presiding over the case concluded that Malema’s statement was a “threat of violence” and said the Guptas and their employees “have a constitutionally protected right not to be threatened with violence”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=EFF's Gupta comments are actual threats - judge |url= http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/stnews/2016/02/12/EFFs-Gupta-comments-are-actual-threats---judge |newspaper=Business Day Live |location= |date=9 February 2016 |access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sekunjalo Investments dispute ====
In November 2012, the Gupta family, through Oakbay, were granted an option to buy 50% of the shares of Independent News and Media South Africa, one of the largest newspaper operations in South Africa, after the company had been bought out by [[Sekunjalo Investments]] who was negotiating the purchase of the group from the Irish owned [[Independent News &amp; Media|Independent News and Media]].  After the successful purchase of the group by Sekunjalo in February 2013 Oakbay sought to exercise its share purchase options.  This led to disagreements between Oakbay and Sekunjalo about the true value and cost of the options and so they could not settle on an agreement as to how much Oakbay should pay for the shares.  Ten percent of buyout by Sekunjalo was also funded by the South African Government Employees Pension Fund who had never agreed to Oakbay having the options and, when asked in early 2016, rejected Oakbay's request to exercise the option to buy 50% of the now Sekunjalo owned newspaper publishing company. This led to Oakbay taking Sekunjalo to court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-06-09-fear-and-loathing-first-look-at-guptas-attempt-to-bite-a-chunk-of-iqbal-survs-stake-in-independent-media/#.V1qxkZF96hc|title=Fear and loathing: First look at Guptas’ attempt to bite a chunk of Iqbal Survé’s stake in Independent Media {{!}} Daily Maverick|website=www.dailymaverick.co.za|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To deal with mounting public criticism the Gupta family hired the public relations firm [[Bell Pottinger]].&lt;ref name="bdayWikipedia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/2016/03/18/guptas-enlist-top-uk-spin-doctors | title=Guptas enlist top UK spin doctors | publisher=Business Day | date=18 March 2016 | accessdate=24 March 2016 | author=Mkokeli, Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In late February 2016 several internet-based sources were altered to be favourable to the Guptas.

In a statement to the ''Financial Times'' on 25 November 2016, Bell Pottinger stated that their role has been “to correct misperceptions” about Oakbay. They have intended to communicate that a competitive, disruptive, job-creating narrative is what is needed to achieve transformation in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/1290e44a-b24d-11e6-9c37-5787335499a0 |title=Zuma mixes new media and old-style tactics to fight detractors |newspaper=Financial Times |access-date=2016-12-18 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media interests owned by Gupta were blamed by other South African media organisations and civil society organisations for running [[fake news]] campaigns against a number of individuals and groups judged hostile to Gupta interests.

=== Corporate response ===
Due to the controversial nature of the family's relationship with Jacob Zuma numerous South African and international banking and auditing firms decided to end their business dealings with Gupta-owned firms in early April 2016.  The auditing firm [[KPMG]], the brokerage [[Sasfin Bank]], and [[Barclays]] Africa’s [[Absa Group Limited|Absa]] bank as well as [[First National Bank (South Africa)|First National Bank]] all announced that they would no longer be dealing with  the Gupta-owned Oakbay Investments, the holding company for the family's investments.&lt;ref name="auditorsIOL"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iol.co.za/business/companies/bankers-auditors-drop-gupta-linked-firms-2006167 | title=Bankers, auditors drop Gupta-linked firms | publisher=IOL news | date=7 April 2016 | accessdate=7 April 2016 |author1=Franz Wild |author2=Renee Bonorchis }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timesKPMG"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/businesstimes/2016/04/04/KPMG-Sasfin-cut-links-with-Gupta-firm | title=KPMG, Sasfin cut links with Gupta firm | publisher=[[Sunday Times (South Africa)|Sunday Times]] | date=4 April 2016 | accessdate=7 April 2016 | author=Cropley, Ed &amp; Motsoeneng, Tisetso}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DMbankingscrews"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-04-07-state-capture-banking-and-business-screws-on-the-guptas-tighten-considerably/#.VwbDN_l96Uk | title=State Capture: Banking and business screws on the Guptas tighten considerably | publisher=[[Daily Maverick]] | date=7 April 2016 | accessdate=7 April 2016 | author=Thamm, Marianne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johan van Dyk at the South African financial forensics firm Censeo stated that companies were disassociating with the family due to concerns that an association with the family could cost them customers.&lt;ref name="auditorsIOL" /&gt;

Oakbay stated that Rupert, through the Rupert-owned Remgro investment company, had interests in the country's financial institutions and that this allowed him to influence banks so that they would stop doing business with Oakbay.

The trade union and ANC political ally [[Congress of South African Trade Unions|COSATU]] criticised the move by South African financial institutions to refuse to do business with Oakbay on the grounds that it was "political posturing" and put the jobs of thousands of South African employees of the firm at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2016-04-11-cosatu-slams-banks-for-shunning-gupta-family-businesses|title=Cosatu slams banks for shunning Gupta family businesses|last=Agency|first=African News|website=The M&amp;G Online|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 20th June it was reported that the Gupta family were back in South Africa after an extended time away from the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://businesstech.co.za/news/government/127315/the-guptas-are-back-in-south-africa/|title=The Guptas are back in South Africa|date=20 June 2016|newspaper=BusinessTech|location=|access-date=24 June 2016|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Hacktivism|hacktivist]] group claiming to be associated with the African chapter of [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] launched a number of [[Distributed denial of service attack|Distributed Denial of Service]] attacks on websites associated with the Gupta family in mid-June 2016.

The South African artist [[Ayanda Mabulu]] exhibited a controversial painting criticizing president Zuma's controversial and close relationship with the Guptas.  The painting portrayed president Zuma performing an act of [[anilingus]] on Atul Gupta in the cockpit of an airplane against a backdrop of the ANC flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/anc-slams-vulgar-zuma-gupta-painting-2044921|title=ANC slams ‘vulgar’ Zuma-Gupta painting|last=Molosankwe|first=Botho|date=13 July 2016|website=|publisher=The Star|access-date=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Zuma's relationship with the family became a campaign issue that negatively affected the ANC's performance in the [[South African municipal elections, 2016|2016 South African municipal elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.enca.com/south-africa/gupta-family-just-caught-south-africa%25E2%2580%2599s-political-crossfire|title='Gupta family just caught in South Africa's political crossfire'|website=www.enca.com|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theafricareport.com/Southern-Africa/south-africas-city-hall-cliffhanger.html|title=South Africa's city hall cliffhanger {{!}} Southern Africa|last=Orderson|first=Crystal|date=4 August 2016|website=www.theafricareport.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial transactions ==
{{See also|Gupta family#Corporate response}}
In October 2016, the South African Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan stated in court documents that the Guptas were implicated in "suspicious transactions worth R6.8 billion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ewn.co.za/2016/10/15/Reports-Gordhan-spills-the-beans-on-Gupta-R6-8-bln-suspicious-transactions|title=REPORTS: GORDHAN SPILLS THE BEANS ON GUPTAS R6.8 BLN 'SUSPICIOUS' TRANSACTIONS|last=Grootes|first=Stephen|date=16 October 2016|website=|publisher=Eye Witness News|access-date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court documents were filed as part of a high court application explaining why the Minister of Finance could not intervene on the Gupta's behalf to require that South African banks continue to provide services to Gupta-owned companies.  The documents stated that South African banks were alarmed by the financial dealings of 14 Gupta-owned businesses and discontinued services to the family to avoid possible legal implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/stnews/2016/10/16/How-Gordhan-lifted-lid-on-dodgy-Gupta-dealings|title=How Gordhan lifted lid on dodgy Gupta dealings|last=Joubert|first=Jan-Jan|date=16 October 2016|website=|publisher=The Sunday Times|access-date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gupta's lawyers publicly disputed Gordhan's statement and stated that a number of errors were made including that a number of the disputed transactions regarding one of the financial dealings, the Optimum mine, occurred when the mine was not yet under the control of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Guptas vow to clear the family name |url=https://www.techcentral.co.za/guptas-vow-to-clear-the-family-name/69305/ |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |location= |date=18 October 2016 |access-date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 August 2017, the North Gauteng High Court dismissed Gordhan’s court application seeking declaratory relief from having to intervene with the banks' decisions to close the bank accounts of the Oakbay investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2017-08-18-gordhan-loses-court-battle-against-the-guptas/|title=Gordhan loses court battle against the Guptas|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation by the South African-based amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism alleges that the Guptas benefited from a number of state contracts using their political connections through a sophisticated system of financial dealings totalling up to R144 million (US$10.6 million) in only one six-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2016/12/07/a-dummys-guide-to-the-guptas-money-laundering-allegations/|title=A Dummy's Guide To The Gupta's Money-Laundering Allegations|last=HuffPost SA|first=|date=8 December 2016|website=Huffington Post South Africa|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report compiled by the [[South African Council of Churches]] and South African academics stated that R40 billion (equivalent to US$3 billion) was illegally smuggled out of South Africa to Dubai by the Gupta family and their associated companies between 2011/12 and 2017.

The '''Hong Kong Association of Banks''' ('''HKAB'''; [[Chinese language]]:香港銀行公會 or 銀公會 in short) is an association created based on a series of [[Banking Ordinance|Bank Ordinance]]s enacted since 1948.  In 1981 the association was established and replaced the [[Exchange Bank Association]]. The ordinance provides a framework for the [[Hong Kong Government]] to exchange views with the banking sector for the further development of the industry.

Although [[banking license]]s are granted by the [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]], no fully licensed bank can operate in  [[Hong Kong]] is thus subject to HKAB's rules. Its members are the banks, not their employees. HKAB is under the auspices of its member banks, which are represented by their designated representatives in general meetings. Each member bank must designate a senior executive to represent it [[wikt:vis-à-vis|vis-à-vis]] HKAB at meetings.

'''Ion Țiriac''' ({{IPA-ro|iˈon t͡siriˈak}}; born 9 May 1939), also known as the 'Brașov Bulldozer'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theroar.com.au/2016/04/28/madrid-open-preview&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Romania]]n businessman and former professional [[tennis]] and [[ice hockey]] player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/10/billionaires-2010_Ion-Tiriac_TLQ2.html|work=Forbes|title=#937 Ion Tiriac|date=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former top 10 player, he is the winner of one grand slam title, the [[1970 French Open]] in men's doubles. Țiriac was the first man to play against a woman in a sanctioned tennis tournament (against Abigail Maynard, in 1975). The highlight of his ice hockey career was participating as defenseman in the Romanian national team at the [[1964 Winter Olympics]].

He gained notoriety in his (mostly) post-playing years as an advisor-coach-manager for the likes of [[Ilie Năstase]], [[Manuel Orantes]], [[Adriano Panatta]], [[Guillermo Vilas]], [[Henri Leconte]] and [[Boris Becker]]. Țiriac is the developer and owner of the [[Madrid Open (tennis)|Mutua Madrid Open]] masters tennis tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tennisworldusa.org/Madrid+Masters+goes+bling-articolo461.html|work=tennisworldusa|title=Madrid Masters goes bling|date=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he was elected as contributor into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itftennis.com/about/news/articles/hingis-elected-to-international-tennis-hall-of-fame.aspx|work=ITF Tennis|date=4 March 2013|accessdate=6 March 2013|title=Hingis elected to International Tennis Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has currently been managing French tennis player [[Lucas Pouille]] since December 2016.

As a tennis player he played dramatic 5 setters against [[Rod Laver]], [[Stan Smith]], [[Jan Kodeš]] or [[Manuel Orantes]]. His singles record includes wins over [[Arthur Ashe]], [[Stan Smith]], [[Roscoe Tanner]], [[Manuel Orantes]], [[Andrés Gimeno]], [[Adriano Panatta]] or [[Nikola Pilić|Niki Pilić]]. He never won against compatriot [[Ilie Năstase]] in their six meetings. He played 3 [[Davis Cup]] finals (in 1969, 1971 and 1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/18/archives/tiriac-upsets-smith-in-3-sets-nastase-ashe-and-richey-gain.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=18 July 1970|title=Tiriac Upsets Smith in 3 Sets; Nastase, Ashe and Richey Gain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports career==
He was born in [[Transylvania]], which is probably the reason why he has the nickname 'Count Dracula'.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150402102043/http://thebiofile.com/2010/05/biofile-with-ion-tiriac&lt;/ref&gt; Țiriac first appeared on the international sports scene as a child [[Table tennis|ping pong]] champion, then subsequently as an ice hockey player on the Romanian national team at the [[1964 Winter Olympics]]. Shortly after that he switched to tennis as his main sport. With fellow Romanian [[Ilie Năstase]] he won the men's doubles in the 1970 French Open and reached the [[Davis Cup]] finals several times in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviscup.com/en/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=10002372 Davis Cup Player Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John McPhee]] wrote of him that his drooping mustache suggests "that this man has been to places most people do not imagine exist.  He appears to be a [[panatela]] ad, a triple agent from Alexandria, a used-car salesman from central Marrakesh. Tiriac has the air of a man who is about to close a deal in a back room behind a back room."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/24/garden/at-wimbledon-with-ion-tiriac-tennis-s-grandest-bad-boy.html?pagewanted=all "AT WIMBLEDON WITH: Ion Tiriac; Tennis's Grandest Bad Boy,"] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiriac participated in the short period during the 1970s when women dabbled as coeds in established men's tennis tournaments. In his first match he defeated Abigail Maynard 6-0 6-0 in their round one match at [[United States Tennis Association|USTA]] pro circuit's Fairfiled County International Tennis Championship. It was the first time ever a female had entered a men’s tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1987/06/22/115606/count-dracula-transylvanian-tennis-guru-ion-tiriac-manager-and-mentor-of-boris-becker-has-sunk-his-teeth-into-many-a-juicy-business-deal|title=COUNT DRACULA|last=Kirkpatrick|first=Curry|work=SI.com|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cliffdrysdale.com/news/mens-pro-circuit-tennis-tournament-returns-to-fairfield-after-24-years|title=MEN’S USTA PRO CIRCUIT TENNIS TOURNAMENT RETURNS TO FAIRFIELD AFTER 24 YEARS {{!}} Cliff Drysdale Tennis|website=cliffdrysdale.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his retirement, he served as coach and manager for players such as [[Ilie Năstase]], [[Guillermo Vilas]], [[Mary Joe Fernández]], [[Goran Ivanišević]] and [[Marat Safin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/sl_price/09/02/marat.safin/index.html|work=CNN|title=In praise of Safin – the head case|date=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became the [[sports agent]] of [[Boris Becker]] and managed his career from 1984 to 1993. In 1998 he became president of the [[Romanian Olympic and Sports Committee]].

Țiriac ran major men's events in Germany, including the season-ending championships in [[ATP World Tour Finals|Hanover]]. Although tennis is now a much smaller part of his portfolio and occupies only 5 percent of his time, he has taken particular pleasure and pride in making [[Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open|Madrid Tennis Open]] a combined men's and women's event with €7.2 million in total prize money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spain at Last Brings the World to Its Clay|publisher=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/09/sports/tennis/09iht-SRMADRID.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=13 May 2009|first=Christopher|last=Clarey|date=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trophy awarded to the tournament winner bears his name.

Țiriac also holds the license for the [[BRD Năstase Ţiriac Trophy|BRD Năstase Țiriac Trophy]] tennis tournament since 1996. It is currently a €450,000 event, part of the [[ATP World Tour 250 series]], held annually in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]], just 2 weeks before the Madrid Open.

In 2012 he was nominated for the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in the contributor category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j_yfTpp-I45pcBlk5tHnihPmu0_g?docId=c0c839f8c28f45f89214622250d580b1|title=
Hingis, Stich, Sukova nominated for tennis hall|date=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 July 2013 he joined the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] as a successful promoter and tournament director for numerous events including the two of the largest Masters 1000 events, the Italian Open and the Madrid Masters.

[[File:Rolls Royce Phantom IV 1952.JPG|thumb|left|One of two [[Rolls-Royce Phantom IV]] owned by Țiriac, part of his car collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiriaccollection.ro/en] The Tiriac Collection&lt;/ref&gt;]]
After his retirement as a professional tennis player, Țiriac became a businessman in Germany. In 1987, he appeared in a TV commercial for [[Miller Lite]] beer with [[Bob Uecker]], who extols Țiriac's supposed humorous qualities, laughing hysterically while Țiriac sits stone-faced.

Following the collapse of communism in Romania, he started numerous businesses and investments back home. In 1990, he founded Banca Țiriac, the first private bank in post-Communist Romania. Between that and several other enterprises (retail, insurance, auto leasing, auto dealerships, airlines, etc.), his fortune was estimated at over US$900 million in 2005.

Ion Țiriac is a car collector. Tiriac Collection represents the exhibition of cars and motorcycles of Mr. Ion Tiriac. Reopened to the public in May 2015, the collection includes historical vehicles manufactured since 1899 and also modern exotics with about 350 cars and 165 cars at full time display on a rotation basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supercars.agent4stars.com/power-cars/ion-tiriac-collection-romania}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors will find the only collection in the world with 2 Rolls-Royce Phantoms IV, as well as exhibits that previously belonged to great names such as Sir [[Elton John]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] or [[Bernie Ecclestone]].

Ion Țiriac became the first Romanian to enter [[Forbes]]' [[Forbes list of billionaires (2007)|List of billionaires]] in the 2007 Forbes rankings, ranking 840th in the world. His wealth was estimated at $1.0 billion as of 2010, according to the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=the World's Billionaires – No. 937 Ion Tiriac|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/10/billionaires-2010_Ion-Tiriac_TLQ2.html|publisher=Forbers|accessdate=1 July 2012|date=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, TOP 300 Capital declared Ion Țiriac the richest man in Romania with a wealth estimated at €1.5–€1.6 billion ($2–$2.2 billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.hotnews.ro/stiri-business-7942996-top-300-capital-declares-ion-tiriac-the-richest-man-romania-followed-businessmen-dinu-patriciu-and-ioan-niculae.htm|title=TOP 300 Capital declares Ion Tiriac the richest man in Romania followed by businessmen Dinu Patriciu and Ioan Niculae |accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Ion Tiriac ranked #1867 on the ''Forbes'' World's Billionaires list, with wealth listed at US $1.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/list/3/#version:static_header:source&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stamps of Romania, 2015-086.jpg|thumb|Ion Tiriac on Romanian postage stamp]]

== Personal life ==
Țiriac was married to Erika Braedt, a [[handball]] player, between 1963 and 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sergiu Nicolaescu: "Da, am cunoscut-o pe Erika"|url=http://www.libertatea.ro/detalii/articol/sergiu-nicolaescu-da-am-cunoscut-o-pe-erika-231464.html|language=Romanian|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has a son, Ion Țiriac Jr., with Mikette von Issenberg, a [[Model (person)|fashion model]]; and further two children with Karim Mihai and Ioana Natalia, with Sophie Ayad, an Egyptian [[journalist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fetița lui Țiriac, în vacanță în România|url=http://stiri.acasa.ro/monden-124/mama-lui-tiriac-jr-o-milionara-excentrica-126406.html|language=Romanian|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mama lui Tiriac jr., o milionara excentrica|url=http://stiri.acasa.ro/monden-124/mama-lui-tiriac-jr-o-milionara-excentrica-126406.html|language=Romanian|accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean Maurer dezvaluie motivul ranchiunii dintre Ion Tiriac si Sergiu Nicolaescu |url=http://www.ziare.com/stiri/ancheta/jean-maurer-dezvaluie-motivul-ranchiunii-dintre-ion-tiriac-si-sergiu-nicolaescu-938355|language=Romanian|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Duncan''' (1834–1905) was a Scottish [[Sugar refinery|sugar refiner]] and businessman, who then became a philanthropist and art collector. His house and grounds in Glasgow became Benmore Botanic Garden, managed by Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.

==Biography==
Duncan was born in 1834 in Greenock. He was the son of a second-hand bookseller.&lt;ref name=sugargiant&gt;Philippe Chalmin {{Google books|bOPogF8v9-kC|The Making of a Sugar Giant: Tate and Lyle, 1859–1989|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1850s, James Duncan was studying chemistry at Glasgow. He had a break and took a boat trip from Greenock to the lochs and coastlines of [[Argyllshire]]. While on [[Loch Long]], he conceived a unique method of refining sugar.&lt;ref name=introduncan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbge.org.uk/assets/files/Publications/Pages%20from%20jamesduncanbook0710-.pdf |title=Introduction to James Duncan |date=13 July 2010|publisher=www.rbge.org.uk | format=PDF |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He patented his idea for sugar refining. Then between 1858 and 1861, he became a partner of the Greenock firm of 'Duncan, Bell &amp; Scott'.&lt;ref name=sugargiant/&gt;&lt;ref name=introduncan/&gt; In 1854, the refinery was producing up to 50,000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;William H Marwick {{Google books|etRcAgAAQBAJ|Scotland in Modern Times|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1861, he developed a factory in [[Silvertown]], London, at [[List of locations in the Port of London|Millbank]] 21 Mincing Lane,&lt;ref name=roots&gt;{{cite web |title= Topic: James Duncan of Benmore &amp; Mary Moubray family |date=24 October 2008 |url=http://www.rootschat.com/forum/index.php?topic=336589.0 |publisher=rootschat.com |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; called the 'Clyde Wharf Refinery'.&lt;ref name=sugargiant/&gt; It was the largest and most profitable sugar refinery in London.&lt;ref name=introduncan/&gt;&lt;ref name=sugarcane&gt;{{cite journal  |last=Martineau |first=George |date=February 1918 |title=Sugar cane and beet, an object lesson|url=https://archive.org/stream/sugarcanebeetobj00martuoft/sugarcanebeetobj00martuoft_djvu.txt
|journal=Sugar Cane |volume=4 |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was always refining the process and learning different applications to keep his company at the top of the industry. At the peak of the business, they were producing up to 2 thousand tons of sugar a week.&lt;ref name=sugargiant/&gt;&lt;ref name=sugarcane/&gt;

In 1878 he was elected fellow of the [[Society of Chemical Industry]], later becoming its Vice-President. By 1879 he held the prestigious post of 'Chairman of the Sugar Refiners' Committee',&lt;ref name=sugarcane/&gt; and also became Vice-President of the 'Railway and Canal Traders' Union'.&lt;ref name=introduncan/&gt;

In 1884, cheap German sugar arrived in the UK, which was much cheaper than UK produced sugar.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt;&lt;ref name=sugarcane/&gt;

In August 1885, he published an article in the 'Sugar Cane' journal, titled 'The bounty on exportation of refined sugar from the United States'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The bounty on exportation of refined sugar from the United States |url=http://search.socialhistory.org/Record/153891/Details |publisher=search.socialhistory.org |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, the unfair foreign competition meant that he had to close his London works of Clyde Wharf.&lt;ref name=sugarcane/&gt;

He returned to Scotland, to manage the smaller refinery business in Greenock. After he retired, he spent time with his sister 'Mary Moubray' in [[Strone]], and then spent the winter months in Italy.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt;
 
==Philanthropy==
James Duncan's charitable work was widely known throughout Britain. he gave 20 per cent of his annual £100,000 salary to a range of causes, making him one of the most committed [[philanthropists]] of the time.&lt;ref name=sugargiant/&gt;&lt;ref name=introduncan/&gt;&lt;ref name=building&gt;{{cite web |first=Mary| last=Gibby |url=http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/benmore-fernery/benmore-fernery.htm |title=The Benmore Fernery |year=2013 |website=www.buildingconservation.com |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=culture&gt;{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Moss |title=Enlightened Victorian James Duncan comes home to the Benmore Botanic Garden in Argyll |date=14 March 2011 |url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/history-and-heritage/work-and-daily-life/rural-heritage/art349955 |publisher=culture24.org.uk |accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scotsman&gt;{{cite news |title=Philanthropist, tycoon and great Scot: James Duncan's time has come again |date=3 March 2011 |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/philanthropist-tycoon-and-great-scot-james-duncan-s-time-has-come-again-1-1503538  |publisher=scotsman.com |accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also built 2 churches for 2 different congregations.&lt;ref name=sugargiant/&gt;

He was known as a major collector of fine art and was also a lender of pictures to annual exhibitions, including the [[Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts]]. In 1878, he was elected Vice-President of the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts.  He regularly contributed works to European exhibitions, including the most prestigious at the [[Paris Salon]], and to key international exhibitions of art and industry in France and Germany in the 1870s and 1880s.&lt;ref name=introduncan/&gt;

He was the first Scottish collector of an [[Impressionist]] work including purchasing in 1883, [[Renoir]]'s painting 'Bay of Naples'.&lt;ref name=scotsman/&gt;
The painting was later lent to the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York (who now own it), for a summer exhibition about James Duncan's collection.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt; Duncan was also one of the most valued and important clients of the influential French picture dealer [[Paul Durand-Ruel]], and regularly frequented the studios of Europe's most famous painters.&lt;ref name=introduncan/&gt; He collected works by the likes of [[Raeburn]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]],&lt;ref name=building/&gt; including [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s masterpiece ''Death of Sardanapalus'.&lt;ref name=culture/&gt;

He was friends with various people in different fields of work including; the chemist [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James "Paraffin" Young]], who established
the world's first commercial oil works; the pioneering ophthalmic surgeon 'Dr Neven Gordon Cluckie', whose work led to the establishment of eye surgeries in hospitals throughout
Britain; the celebrated preacher [[Charles Spurgeon]]; [[Henry Boyd (academic)|Rev. Henry Boyd]] (Principal of [[Hertford College Oxford]], 1878–1922), with whom Duncan
had worked closely in the 1870s to improve working conditions in London's East End; and [[Gustave Doré]], the French artist whose gallery, paintings and book illustrations proved so popular in Britain.&lt;ref name=introduncan/&gt;&lt;ref name=culture/&gt; 
“Duncan also employed his significant wealth in helping the poor in Scotland and England and improving the working conditions of his workforce, building churches and schools, providing medical care and introducing an eight-hour working day." noted Peter Baxter (Benmore House Curator).&lt;ref name=culture/&gt;

Duncan had also been in contact with the eminent botanist [[Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker]] and with [[Henry Morton Stanley]], the explorer and friend of [[David Livingstone]] who visited Duncan some time in the 1870s or 1880s.&lt;ref name=introduncan/&gt;

In [[Kilmun]], at Graham's Point there is a memorial to James Duncan. Which was designed by A. Macfarlane Shannon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kilmun, Graham's Point, Memorial to James Duncan, Kilmun |url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/sc-50435-kilmun-graham-s-point-memorial-to-james-d |publisher=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk| accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benmore House==
In 1870, James Duncan purchased Benmore House near Dunoon, Argyll.&lt;ref name=building/&gt;&lt;ref name=benmore&gt;{{cite web|first=Donald |last=Stalker |title=Transactions of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland Plantations of the Estates of Benmore and Kilmun, Argyllshire 
|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/agriculture/page45.htm |publisher=electricscotland.com |accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then set about building a gallery (to showcase his large collection of fine arts. As well as a [[fernery]] and one of the largest greenhouses in Scotland.&lt;ref name=culture/&gt;

The estates amounted up to 12,260 acres of land. He made extensive improvements to the land. On some of which he grazed ''West Highland cattle'' and [[Scottish Blackface|blackfaced sheep]]. The sheep were first seen at the [[Paris International Exhibition of 1878]]. His flock of sheep gained awards at the annual exhibitions of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland.&lt;ref name=benmore/&gt;

He also had over six million trees planted as part of the large landscape alterations he had designed. Including, commissioning features such as the 'Golden Gates'.Which were earlier shown at the Paris International Exhibition.&lt;ref name=scotsman/&gt;

Following the introduction of a German sugar bounty, Duncan had a massive loss of fortune and had to sell the estate in 1889.&lt;ref name=building/&gt;

It was acquired by the Young Family and later gifted to [[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh]]&lt;ref name=roots/&gt; It is now the [[Benmore Botanic Garden]].

His art collection at Benmore was split up and sold, his paintings are now housed in some of world's greatest museums such as the [[Louvre]], the [[Belvedere, Vienna|Belvedere]] in Vienna, the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which is home to four of Duncan's pictures.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt;&lt;ref name=scotsman/&gt;

'''Jorge Paulo Agostinho Mendes''' (born 7 January 1966), better known simply as '''Jorge Mendes''', is a Portuguese [[association football|football]] [[sports agent|agent]]. He is registered with the [[Portuguese Football Federation]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/footballgovernance/playeragents/association=por.html Players' Agents List], fifa.com, retrieved 30 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and heads the [[GestiFute]] company, founded in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gestifute.com/gestifute/quemsomos.php "GestiFute: About Us"] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090723235400/http://www.gestifute.com/gestifute/quemsomos.php |date=23 July 2009 }} Retrieved 2 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Mendes is among the most influential football agents in the world, with clients including [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], [[David de Gea]], [[José Mourinho]], [[Diego Costa]], and [[James Rodríguez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burt|first1=Jason|title=Diego Costa: I take things to limit but I did nothing wrong|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/11381605/Diego-Costa-I-take-things-to-limit-but-I-did-nothing-wrong.html|accessdate=1 February 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mendestel"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/10085617/Monaco-break-the-bank-with-110m-spree-and-send-out-warning-to-Europes-giants.html "Monaco break the bank with £110m spree and send out warning to Europe's giants"] by Oliver Brown, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 28 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/renato-sanches-to-bayern-munich-manchester-united-target-moves-to-bundesliga-champions-in-276million-a7022181.html "Renato Sanches to Bayern Munich: Manchester United target moves to Bundesliga champions for £27.6million"] by Mark Critchley, ''[[The Independent]]'', 10 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.as.com/en/2016/07/17/football/1468753760_104958.html "Transfers | Real Madrid and Barça do battle for Valencia's André Gomes - AS.com"] ''[[Diario AS]]'', 17 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Mendes is often referred to as a "super-agent".&lt;ref name="mendestel"/&gt;&lt;ref name=rise/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marca.com/2013/05/28/en/football/international_football/1369775727.html "Falcao on the verge of Monaco move"], ''[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]'', 28 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Mendes has been named ''Best Agent of the Year'' at the [[Globe Soccer Awards]] six consecutive times, from 2010 to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globesoccer.com/winners/jorge-mendes-best-agent-year/ "Jorge Mendes (Best Agent of the Year)], ''[[Globe Soccer Awards]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Mendes began as a footballer but was forced to abandon his hopes of a professional career after being rejected by a number of Portuguese clubs when he was in his early 20s.&lt;ref name="bar"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/article6481331.ece "Jorge Mendes: from bar owner to football super-agent"] by Matt Hughes, ''[[The Times]]'', 12 June 2009. Retrieved 2 August 2010. (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he ran a video rental store, worked as a [[Disc jockey|DJ]] and opened a bar and nightclub in [[Caminha]].&lt;ref name="rise"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/18/jorge-mendes-profile-agent "Jorge Mendes: The rise and rise of Portugal's super-agent"] by David Conn, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 January 2011. Retrieved 14 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bar"/&gt;

==Career as an agent==

===First deals===
Mendes' first deal as a football agent came in 1996 when he brokered [[Nuno Espírito Santo|Nuno]]'s move from [[Vitória S.C.|Vitória de Guimarães]] to [[Deportivo de La Coruña]]. He had met the goalkeeper in a bar in [[Guimarães]].&lt;ref name="bar"/&gt; After that deal, Mendes gradually attracted more Portuguese players, including [[Jorge Andrade]]. [[Hugo Viana]]'s move from [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting CP]] to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the [[Premier League]] for around €12&amp;nbsp;million in 2002 was his first major international transfer.&lt;ref name="bar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=26854.html "Newcastle close on Viana"]; UEFA.com, 20 June 2002. Retrieved 2 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of Mendes' success was ostensibly based on his frequent presence at football schools and youth teams throughout Portugal, spotting and signing young players, as he did with [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] and [[Ricardo Quaresma]].&lt;ref name="How"/&gt;

It has been reported that Mendes came to physical blows at the [[Lisbon Portela Airport|Portela Airport]] in [[Lisbon]] with [[Luís Figo]]'s agent, José Veiga, whose influence he was gradually supplanting at this time.&lt;ref name="rise"/&gt; Mendes has also been accused by other agents of moving in on their players shortly before agreeing major deals.&lt;ref name="rise"/&gt;

===Mourinho and Chelsea===
In 2004, Mendes brokered [[José Mourinho]]'s move from [[FC Porto|Porto]] to manage [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], despite Mourinho already having an agent, José Baidek, whom Mourinho had known since his time at [[U.D. Leiria|União de Leiria]] and who had reportedly lined up a move to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].&lt;ref name="How"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/how-mendes-has-made-himself-key-player-behind-the-biggest-deals-in-europe-846361.html "How Mendes has made himself key player behind the biggest deals in Europe"], by Jason Burt, ''[[The Independent]]'', 13 June 2008. Retrieved 14 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Mourinho and Mendes negotiated with the agent [[Pini Zahavi]], who acted as Chelsea's representative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/3692469.stm "Mourinho ready for Chelsea"], [[BBC]], 7 May 2004. Retrieved 14 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The deal established Mendes's importance. He built up a roster of the leading Portuguese players and every Portuguese player that followed Mourinho to Chelsea was a client of Mendes, including [[Ricardo Carvalho]], [[Paulo Ferreira]], [[Tiago Mendes|Tiago]] and [[Maniche]].&lt;ref name="How"/&gt; Mendes was paid by Chelsea to act for the player and for the club.&lt;ref name="Court case that shows who gets what from football's richest transfers"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/david-conn-inside-sport-blog/2011/jan/18/jorge-mendes-super-agent?intcmp=239 "Court case that shows who gets what from football's richest transfers"] by David Conn, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 January 2011. Retrieved 14 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

GestiFute was also involved in part-owning the economic rights of a number of these players. In July 2003, Porto bought 20% of Brazilian-born Portuguese professional footballer [[Deco]]'s rights from GestiFute in exchange for €2.25&amp;nbsp;million, plus 5% of the economic rights for Ricardo Carvalho and Paulo Ferreira. Shortly afterwards, GestiFute sold a further 15% of Deco's economic rights to the club, this time in return for €1.25&amp;nbsp;million and 10% of striker [[Benni McCarthy]]'s rights.&lt;ref name="Why"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/david-conn-inside-sport-blog/2011/feb/03/chelsea-david-luiz "Why £5.25m of the money Chelsea paid for David Luiz went to investors"] by David Conn, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 3 February 2011. Retrieved 14 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Chelsea===
After Mourinho's departure from Chelsea in September 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/7003912.stm "Mourinho makes shock Chelsea exit"], [[BBC]], 20 September 2007. Retrieved 11 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Mendes oversaw his move to [[Inter Milan]] in 2008 for a fee that made him the highest paid coach in the world,&lt;ref name="bar"/&gt; and then, in May 2010, that which saw him move from Inter to become [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]'s manager on a four-year contract worth £40&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article7134144.ece "Mourinho to quit for £40m Real Madrid deal"] by Duncan Castles, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 23 May 2010. Retrieved 14 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8699064.stm "Jose Mourinho's move to Real Madrid 'to take time'"], [[BBC]], 25 May 2010. Retrieved 2 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Mendes also handled the deal that took the manager [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]] to Chelsea, negotiating a three-year contract worth between £5.5&amp;nbsp;million and £6.25&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="How"/&gt; At that summer's [[UEFA Euro 2008]] tournament, Mendes had been allowed privileged access to the [[Portugal national football team|Portugal national team]]'s hotel by Scolari, who was then managing the national side.&lt;ref name="How"/&gt;

====Ronaldo, Nani and Anderson====
Mendes oversaw the transfer of Cristiano Ronaldo from Sporting CP to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for £12.24&amp;nbsp;million in 2003 and in 2007 those of [[Anderson (footballer, born 1988)|Anderson]] and [[Nani]] to the same club for £46&amp;nbsp;million. The Nani transfer reportedly followed only once the player had dropped his existing agent, Ana Almeida.&lt;ref name="rise"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How"/&gt; That summer, Mendes was also responsible for the transfers of [[Pepe (footballer, born 1983)|Pepe]] to Real Madrid for £25&amp;nbsp;million and [[Simão Sabrosa|Simão]] to [[Atlético Madrid]] for £16.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="How"/&gt;

Mendes' association with Anderson reflected the connections he established in South America, in which he worked closely with [[Pini Zahavi]].&lt;ref name="bar"/&gt; Part of the deal that took Anderson to Manchester United saw his previous club Porto pay Mendes a reported £4&amp;nbsp;million for his share of Anderson's registration. Mendes was said to have contributed 20% of the £3.75&amp;nbsp;million Porto paid [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]] in Brazil to sign the midfielder in 2006.&lt;ref name="Jose agent's £4m jackpot on Anderson"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130114053124/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/sport/article-23398861-jose-agents-4m-jackpot-on-anderson.do "Jose agent's £4m jackpot on Anderson"], [[The Evening Standard]], 1 June 2007. Retrieved 2 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Mendes was reported to have made £4&amp;nbsp;million from Cristiano Ronaldo's £80&amp;nbsp;million transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid.&lt;ref name="bar"/&gt;

====Bebé transfer====
In August 2010, football agent Gonçalo Reis complained that he had been left on the sidelines when [[Bebé]], a player he represented, was transferred to Manchester United from Vitória de Guimarães. "When Mendes arrived," Reis said, "I was out of the transaction."&lt;ref name="cut"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/7966189/Bebes-former-agent-claims-he-was-cut-out-of-Manchester-United-transfer-deal.html "Bébé's former agent claims he was cut out of Manchester United transfer deal"] by Mark Ogden, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 26 August 2010. Retrieved 26 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, Reis arranged Bebé's move to Vitória as a free agent from [[C.F. Estrela da Amadora|Estrela da Amadora]] in the semi-professional Portuguese third division after the cancellation of the player's contract due to the club's inability to pay his wages. Manchester United signed Bebé for a reported fee of £7.4&amp;nbsp;million five weeks later, when he had played just six pre-season friendlies for Vitória. Reis received notification that he had been sacked by Bebé in a letter dated 5 August that arrived two days before the completion of the Manchester United transfer on 11 August.&lt;ref name="cut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bébé"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/10/portugese-police-manchester-united-bebe-transfer "Portuguese police to question Manchester United over Bébé transfer"] by David Conn, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 10 May 2012.

Retrieved 14 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Reis officially took his complaints to [[FIFA]] in May 2012.&lt;ref name="interesting"/&gt;

At Vitória's subsequent general meeting, the club's directors revealed that Mendes had received €3.6&amp;nbsp;million of the €9&amp;nbsp;million fee from the Bebé transfer, with reports in Portugal suggesting that €2.7&amp;nbsp;million of that sum came from the 30% of the player's economic rights initially retained by Bebé when he moved to Vitória but bought from the player by Mendes for €100,000.&lt;ref name="Bébé"/&gt;&lt;ref name="street"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/david-conn-inside-sport-blog/2011/jan/20/manchester-united-bebe "How Manchester United's Bébé went from street kid to €9m player"] by David Conn, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 January 2011.

Retrieved 14 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Emilio Macedo, club president of Vitória de Guimarães club, called Mendes "the bulwark of this transfer" and defended the agent, saying, "With all due respect to other agents, this country owes him a lot because he handles large transfers and brings money into the country because this is like an export."&lt;ref name="cut"/&gt; The transfer was subsequently investigated by the Portuguese police.&lt;ref name="Bébé"/&gt;&lt;ref name="interesting"/&gt;

Manchester United's then manager, [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]], admitted that he had not seen Bebé play before signing the player.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/aug/17/manchester-united-transfer-window "Sir Alex Ferguson breaks the mould bringing Bébé to Manchester United"] by Paul Wilson, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 August 2010. Retrieved 15 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He had reportedly been recommended to the club by [[Carlos Queiroz]], who had two spells as assistant manager at Manchester United and who at that time was coach of the Portugal national team.&lt;ref name="Bébé"/&gt;  Queiroz's relationship with United had been important in the transfers of Anderson and Nani in 2007; he is also represented by Mendes.&lt;ref name="Bébé"/&gt;

===2014 summer transfer window===
Mendes brokered four of the seven biggest deals worldwide during the 2014 summer transfer window from which he earned an estimated £30&amp;nbsp;million. [[James Rodríguez]] moved to Real Madrid from [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] for £63&amp;nbsp;million, [[Ángel Di María]] from Real Madrid to Manchester United for £60&amp;nbsp;million, [[Diego Costa]] from Atlético Madrid to Chelsea for £32&amp;nbsp;million and [[Eliaquim Mangala]] from Porto to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] for £32&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/shortcuts/2014/sep/02/jorge-mendes-football-agent-transfer-deadline-day-di-maria-man-utd-costa-chelsea "Jorge Mendes: the football agent who just won transfer deadline day"] by Diego Costa, ''[[The Guardian]], 2 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third-party ownership accusations===
On 22 September 2014, an investigation by ''[[The Guardian]]'' implicated Jorge Mendes alongside ex-Manchester United and -Chelsea chief executive [[Peter Kenyon]] in breaching [[FIFA]] regulations regarding third-party ownership and conflict of interest in player representation, buying player rights through companies based in [[Jersey]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].&lt;ref name=powerful&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/22/-sp-jorge-mendes-agent-third-party-ownership-players "Jorge Mendes: the most powerful man in football?"] by David Conn, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 22 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This followed another report published in January 2014 suggesting Kenyon's ex-club Chelsea have invested in third-party ownership via Mendes and Kenyon, a practice banned by the Premier League. Chelsea declined to comment on the accusations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/30/chelsea-links-third-party-ownership "Questions for Chelsea over links to third-party ownership of players"] by David Conn, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 30 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 September 2014, [[UEFA]] announced their intention to crack down on the practice of [[Third-party ownership in association football|third-party ownership]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/23/uefa-third-party-ownership-champions-league "Uefa plans rule change to clamp down on third-party player ownership"] by Owen Gibson and David Conn, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 23 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
After the takeover of English [[Football League Championship|Championship]] club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] by [[Fosun International]], Mendes was implemented as an agent for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jun/19/jorge-mendes-wolves-influence-chinese-owners-signings |title= Jorge Mendes and Wolves: how deep does the agent’s influence run? |publisher=The Guardian |date=19 June 2017 |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the help of team general manager Andrea Butti and sporting director [[Kevin Thelwell]], 12 players were signed within six weeks during the 2016 summer transfer window.

===Tax avoidance===
In December 2016,  leaked documents suggested that Mendes was involved in a massive tax avoidance scheme with both Mourinho and Ronaldo accused of not paying taxes by using offshore accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2017/06/22/inenglish/1498127640_892693.html |title=Spain’s Tax Agency puts the spotlight on soccer super agent Jorge Mendes |publisher= El Pais |date=22 June 2017 |accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swansea City===
Mendes began working with [[Premier League]] club [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] during the January 2018 transfer window, assisting the club in identifying players for newly-appointed manager [[Carlos Carvalhal]]. Previously, he brought Portugal U21 midfielder [[Renato Sanches]] to the club, on loan from [[Bayern Munich]], in August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/01/19/swansea-turn-jorge-mendes-help-transfer-window-signings/ |title=Swansea turn to Jorge Mendes to help with transfer window signings |publisher= The Telegraph |date=19 January 2018 |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GestiFute and CAA==
In 2008, GestiFute announced that it had entered into partnership with [[Creative Artists Agency]] (CAA) in the United States to "create global opportunities for current and future clients", following CAA's expansion into the sports market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20080709005068&amp;newsLang=en "CAA Sports and International Soccer Agency Gestifute Create Global Partnership to Represent Top Talent"], ''[[Business Wire]]'', 9 July 2008.

'''Justin Berkmann''' (born December 1963), is a DJ and nightclub owner. He is the second son of Joseph Berkmann and his second wife, Jean Berkmann (née Barwis) and younger brother of [[Marcus Berkmann]], an author. They were both educated at [[Highgate School]] in [[North London]].&lt;ref&gt;Highgate School Register 7th Edn 1833-1988, Ed. Patrick Hughes &amp; Ian F Davies 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Berkmann is the co-founder of the nightclub and brand, [[Ministry of Sound]]&lt;ref name="Pilcher2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pilcher|first=Tim|title=E, the Incredibly Strange History of Ecstasy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4fbXEVQcuU8C&amp;pg=PA145|accessdate=26 June 2011|date=2008-04-07|publisher=Running Press|isbn=978-0-7624-3184-7|pages=145–}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now MSHK Group). Since its conception in 1991, the company has grown from a nightclub in [[London]]’s [[Elephant and Castle]] to a multi-media business. Berkmann's initial involvement was from January 1990 until May 1994, and he was resident DJ and Artistic Director during that period. He then rejoined in 2006 to build their franchise clubs in [[Singapore]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]].

It was found out in August 2018 that Berkmann is 4th cousin once removed to [[Coronation Street]] actor Liam Bairstow who plays Alex Warner.

== Professional career ==
Berkmann was introduced to house music by a friend, who recommended [[Farley "Jackmaster" Funk]]'s track "Funkin With the Drums Again" to him. Berkmann soon started to DJ, and in 1986 he moved to New York City, where he visited the [[Paradise Garage]], which he described as "an amazing club. It had lights, darkness, music, quiet – everything you wanted. I thought it was the perfect template, so I came back to London in 1988, determined to do something similar". He then spent a year looking for a suitable site, finding a car park in [[Elephant and Castle]] "with a roof covered in pigeon poo". He joined forces with entrepreneur [[James Palumbo]] and Humphrey Waterhouse at the end of 1989 and 21 months later they opened [[Ministry of Sound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/nov/13/how-we-made-ministry-sound-london |title=How we made: Ministry of Sound |last=Simpson |first=Dave |date=13 November 2018 |website=[[theguardian.com]]|access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berkmann was in charge of booking the talent and being resident DJ until mid-1994. Berkmann sourced American DJ talent like [[Tony Humphries (musician)|Tony Humphries]] from the New York and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] scenes (which centred on [[Club Zanzibar]] and the [[Paradise Garage]]).
Following this, Berkmann continued to DJ. He rejoined Ministry of Sound in 2006 to assist with the design and sound installation in the Ministry of Sound, Singapore, later to become Venues Development Manager for MoS International, and co-creating the concept and design for their club in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia with [[Austen Derek]].

In 2011, one of his older Ministry of Sound mixes was released in ''[[Live &amp; Remastered]]''.

'''Kenan Eyup Sahin''' (generally known simply as Dr. Kenan Sahin) is a [[Turkish people|Turkish]]-born American Scientist and Entrepreneur. He is the Founder/ President and the Chief Technology Officer of TIAX LLC in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]]. He is also the Founder/CEO of CAMX Power which formerly was a division of [[TIAX|TIAX LLC]] and in May 2014 became a separate company.

==Early life and education==
He was  born  in  [[Aydin]], [[Turkey]]. He completed elementary school in Aydin, graduated from Robert  Academy (middle  school) in  Istanbul Turkey. He started high school at Robert Lycee but completed  it at [[Inglewood High School (California)|Inglewood High School]] in California. He then started his college work at Robert College (now the Bosphorus University) and then transferred to MIT  as a junior to finish his BS as well as his PhD at MIT.

==Business career==
The early years of Dr. Sahin's entrepreneurial career overlapped with the final years of his academic career which began at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and continued at MIT with interleaved periods at Robert College of Istanbul (now the Bosphorus University) [[Harvard University]], and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. He has global patents and numerous academic publications.

In 1982, Dr. Sahin founded Kenan Systems with a $1,000 personal investment, as part of his outreach activities while at MIT. The company grew to become a world leader in telecommunications software, creating nearly 1,000 professional jobs. Dr. Sahin was named the Ernst &amp; Young New England Entrepreneur of the Year in 1998.

In 1999, Dr. Sahin sold Kenan Systems to [[Nokia Bell Labs|Lucent Technologies/Bell Laboratories]] for $1.5 billion in a stock swap when the Lucent stock was trading at $50 a share. Subsequent to the sale, accepting a two year offer from Lucent/Bell Labs, he became Vice President of Software Technology at Bell Labs, a member of the managing group of Bell Labs and then the President of Lucent’s Software Products Group, managing 4,500 people. The same year he made a major unrestricted gift to MIT, the largest ever until then, which MIT allocated to its School of Humanities and Social Science, also endowing the Dean of the same school.

Dr. Sahin left Lucent/Bell Labs in early 2001 to return to Boston and later to start TIAX LLC. He significantly expanded TIAX in early 2002 by acquiring assets and hiring staff from the Technology and Innovation unit of [[Arthur D. Little|Arthur D. Little, Inc.]] which had come to an end.

In 2003, the World Economic Forum named Dr. Sahin one of its 40 Technology Pioneers. He received the New England Business and Technology's first "Circle of Excellence" award in 2004. In 2006, he was given the Golden Door Award by the International Institute of Boston in recognition of his achievements as both an entrepreneur and an academic. In 2007, TIAX was recognized as one of the Global Growth companies by the World Economic Forum, and Dr. Sahin was invited to Davos-East held in Dalian, China to address Innovation. In 2010, he was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor and this recognition was entered into the US Congressional records. In 2015, he was given an honorary doctorate in engineering by [[Bosphorus University]] in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]].

===TIAX===
Using its laboratories, scientists, engineers and technicians, and links to innovation sources, TIAX selects and matures early stage technologies primarily in energy into innovative, de-risked, IP-based and market-ready proto-products for service-supported licensing, sale or joint. CAMX Power is one major result of the TIAX model. Its flagship product CAM-7, one of the most advanced [[cathode]] materials for [[lithium-ion battery]] applications in the automotive and high-end portable electronics markets has been licensed for scaled up production by one of the largest chemical/material companies.

==Board memberships==
He serves on the Board of MIT (life member), Council of Competitiveness Executive Committee, the Board of Robert College of Istanbul and the Board of Overseers of the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] ( Emeritus). He served on the Board [[Argonne National Laboratory]], [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association]] Board in Washington, DC, on the MIT Energy Initiative Advisory Board, on the Boards of [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], [[AFS Intercultural Programs]], and as a team member for the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress.

==Personal life==
Dr. Sahin currently resides in Massachusetts.

==Career==

===Early career===
Lee got his start in life working at the Chon Saan Palace restaurant which his father Armando Chang opened in 1974. From a small family restaurant, under his management he grew it to a chain with three locations and fifty staff, making it "one of the biggest names in restaurants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=12628|title=7 On the Inside of Chon Saan Palace's Kitchen|work=7 News Belize|date=2008-11-12|accessdate=2012-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also became the president of the Chinese Association of Belize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/13922|title=Chinese-Belizeans celebrate New Year|work= News 5 Belize|date=2004-01-22|accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his tenure as president, the CAB worked closely with the [[Belize Police Department]] on issues of crime prevention, and also donated several motorcycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=16923|title=The Chinese Community’s Contribution|work=7 News Belize|date=2010-05-18|accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served in a variety of public positions, for example sitting on the Belize District Liquor Licensing board and working as an occasional court translator.&lt;ref name="Amandala20090220"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=8190|first=Aaron|last=Humes|title=Archie Lee and Wilmot square off!|work=[[Amandala]]|date=2009-02-20|accessdate=2012-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://belize.me.uk/2010/05/14/chinese-national-pays-fine/|title=Chinese National pays $1000 fine for frying chicken|work=Belize Local News|date=2010-05-14|accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In politics===
Chang first announced his intention to join electoral politics in August 2009.&lt;ref name="News520090806"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/904|title=Lee Mark Chang: 1 citizenship and 100% Belizean|work=News 5 Belize|date=2009-08-06|accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, [[Prime Minister of Belize|PM]] [[Dean Barrow]] appointed Chang to the Senate and made him acting President, to fill in for [[Andrea Gill]] who was on [[maternity leave]]. Politicians from both sides of the aisle such as the PUP's [[Lisa Shoman]] offered congratulations to him on what they described as "the epitome of Belize's cultural diversity" and an "important milestone" for Belize's Chinese community.&lt;ref name="Reporter20100820"/&gt;

Lee entered the [[Belizean general and local elections, 2012|2012 "double election"]] as the UDP's [[National Assembly of Belize|National Assembly]] candidate for the Freetown constituency.  In the run-up to the election, an unknown person released a forged letter claiming to be from Chang, promising to distribute land in Belama to the Belize Chinese Association in exchange for campaign contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=21897|title=Lee Mark Cries Foul in Freetown|work=7 News Belize|date=2012-02-29|accessdate=2012-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Belize Times]]'' also published a number of racist comments about him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.bz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4450:pup-trying-to-inject-racism-in-freetown&amp;catid=53:headlines|first=Shane|last=Williams|title=PUP Trying to Inject Racism in Freetown|work=Belize Guardian|date=2012-03-01|accessdate=2012-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee lost the election to PUP party leader [[Francis Fonseca]] by 1,558 to 1,408 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lovetv.com.bz/2012/04/04/cj-approves-application-for-election-petition-against-francis-fonseca/|title=CJ approves application for election petition against Francis Fonseca|work=Love TV Belize|date=2012-04-04|accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early April Chang filed a motion for an [[election petition]] in April, alleging that Fonseca's agents engaged in bribery of the electorate. [[Chief Justice of Belize|Chief Justice]] [[Kenneth Benjamin (judge)|Kenneth Benjamin]] granted him leave to bring the petition; it was the first election petition in Belize's history to be granted on the grounds of bribery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=22149|title=Bribery Petition Against PUP Leader Granted Leave To Be Heard|work=7 News Belize|date=2012-04-04|accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Objectivist movement}}

'''Objectivism''' is a [[philosophical system]] developed by [[Russian Americans|Russian-American]] writer [[Ayn Rand]]. Rand first expressed Objectivism in her fiction, most notably ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' (1943) and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' (1957), and later in non-fiction essays and books.&lt;ref name="Badhwar 2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Badhwar|Long|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Peikoff]], a professional philosopher and Rand's designated intellectual heir,&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Authors Online'', s.v. "Leonard Peikoff." Accessed March 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McLemee"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McLemee |first=Scott |url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9909/rand.html |title=The Heirs Of Ayn Rand: Has Objectivism Gone Subjective? |journal=[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]] |date=September 1999 |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=45–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; later gave it a more formal structure. Rand described Objectivism as "the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute".&lt;ref&gt;"About the Author" in {{harvnb|Rand|1992|pp=1170–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peikoff characterizes Objectivism as a "closed system" that is not subject to change.&lt;ref name="Fact and Value" /&gt;

Objectivism's central tenets are that [[reality]] exists independently of [[consciousness]], that human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception (see ''[[Direct and indirect realism]]''), that one can attain objective knowledge from perception through the process of [[concept]] formation and [[inductive logic]], that the proper [[morality|moral]] purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness (see ''[[Rational egoism]]''), that the only [[social system]] consistent with this morality is one that displays full respect for [[Individual and group rights|individual rights]] embodied in ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]], and that the role of [[art]] in human life is to transform humans' [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] ideas by selective reproduction of reality into a physical form—a work of art—that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally.

Academic philosophers have mostly ignored or rejected Rand's philosophy.&lt;ref name="academic"&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|2013|p=1}}; {{harvnb|Badhwar|Long|2012}}; {{harvnb|Gotthelf|2000|p=1}}; {{harvnb|Machan|2000|p=9}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Heyl|1995|p=223}}; {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1984|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Objectivism has been a significant influence among [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarians]] and [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]].&lt;ref name="politicalinfluence"&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=107–08, 124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Objectivist movement]], which Rand founded, attempts to spread her ideas to the public and in academic settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Rand originally expressed her philosophical ideas in her novels, most notably, ''The Fountainhead'' and ''Atlas Shrugged''. She further elaborated on them in her periodicals ''[[The Objectivist Newsletter]]'', ''[[The Objectivist]]'', and ''[[Objectivist periodicals#The Ayn Rand Letter|The Ayn Rand Letter]]'', and in non-fiction books such as ''[[Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology]]'' and ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness]]''.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;{{cite news |first=Harriet |last=Rubin |title=Ayn Rand's Literature of Capitalism |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/15/business/15atlas.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=September 15, 2007 |accessdate=September 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Objectivism" derives from the idea that human knowledge and values are [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]: they exist and are determined by the nature of reality, to be discovered by one's mind, and are not created by the thoughts one has.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1967|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand stated that she chose the name because her preferred term for a philosophy based on the primacy of [[existence]]—"[[existentialism]]"—had already been taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand characterized Objectivism as "a philosophy for living on earth", grounded in reality, and aimed at defining human nature and the nature of the world in which we live.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;

===Metaphysics: objective reality===
Rand's philosophy begins with three [[axiom]]s: existence, consciousness, and [[Law of identity|identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=4–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand defined an axiom as "a statement that identifies the base of knowledge and of any further statement pertaining to that knowledge, a statement necessarily contained in all others whether any particular speaker chooses to identify it or not. An axiom is a proposition that defeats its opponents by the fact that they have to accept it and use it in the process of any attempt to deny it."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1040}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As Objectivist philosopher [[Leonard Peikoff]] argued, Rand's argument for axioms "is not a proof that the axioms of existence, consciousness, and identity are true. It is proof that they are ''axioms'', that they are at the base of knowledge and thus inescapable."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand held that ''existence'' is the perceptually self-evident fact at the base of all other knowledge, i.e., that "existence exists." She further held that to be is to be ''something'', that "existence ''is'' identity." That is, to be is to be "an entity of a specific nature made of specific attributes." That which has no nature or attributes does not and cannot exist. The axiom of existence is grasped in differentiating something from nothing, while the law of identity is grasped in differentiating one thing from another, i.e., one's first awareness of the law of non-contradiction, another crucial base for the rest of knowledge. As Rand wrote, "A leaf ... cannot be all red and green at the same time, it cannot freeze and burn at the same time... [[A is A]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Objectivism rejects belief in anything alleged to transcend existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=31–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand argued that consciousness is "the faculty of perceiving that which exists." As she put it, "to be conscious is to be conscious of ''something''", that is consciousness itself cannot be distinguished or grasped except in relation to an independent reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It cannot be aware only of itself—there is no 'itself' until it is aware of something."&lt;ref name="Gotthelf"&gt;{{harvnb|Gotthelf|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Objectivism holds that the mind does not create reality, but rather, it is a means of discovering reality.&lt;ref name="ITOE"&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressed differently, existence has "primacy" over consciousness, which must conform to it. Any other approach Rand termed "the primacy of consciousness", including any variant of metaphysical subjectivism or theism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1982|pp=24–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectivist philosophy derives its explanations of action and [[Causality|causation]] from the axiom of identity, calling causation "the law of identity applied to action."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1037}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rand, it is entities that act, and every action is the action of an [[entity]]. The way entities act is caused by the specific nature (or "identity") of those entities; if they were different they would act differently. As with the other axioms, an implicit understanding of causation is derived from one's primary observations of causal connections among entities even before it is verbally identified, and serves as the basis of further knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epistemology: reason===
According to Rand, attaining knowledge beyond what is given in perception requires both [[volition (psychology)|volition]] (or the exercise of [[free will]]) and adherence to a specific method of validation through observation, concept-formation, and the application of [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[deductive reasoning]]. For example, a belief in dragons, however sincere, does not mean reality contains any dragons. A process of proof identifying the basis in reality of a claimed item of knowledge is necessary to establish its truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=116–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectivist [[epistemology]] begins with the principle that "consciousness is identification". This is understood to be a direct consequence of the metaphysical principle that "existence is identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1961|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand defined "reason" as "the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Says Rand, "The fundamental concept of method, the one on which all the others depend, is [[logic]]. The distinguishing characteristic of logic (the art of non-contradictory identification) indicates the nature of the actions (actions of consciousness required to achieve a correct identification) and their goal (knowledge)—while omitting the length, complexity or specific steps of the process of logical inference, as well as the nature of the particular cognitive problem involved in any given instance of using logic."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rand, [[consciousness]] possesses a specific and finite identity, just like everything else that exists; therefore, it must operate by a specific method of validation. An item of knowledge cannot be "disqualified" by being arrived at by a specific process in a particular form. Thus, for Rand, the fact that consciousness must itself possess identity implies the rejection of both universal skepticism based on the "limits" of consciousness, as well as any claim to revelation, emotion or faith based belief.

Objectivist epistemology maintains that all knowledge is ultimately based on perception. "Percepts, not sensations, are the given, the self-evident."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand considered the validity of the senses to be axiomatic, and claimed that purported arguments to the contrary all commit the fallacy of the "stolen concept"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Branden |first=Nathaniel |date=January 1963 |title=The Stolen Concept |journal=The Objectivist Newsletter |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2, 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; by presupposing the validity of concepts that, in turn, presuppose the validity of the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She held that perception, being physiologically determined, is incapable of error. For example, [[optical illusion]]s are errors in the conceptual identification of what is seen, not errors in sight itself.&lt;ref name="Kelley 1986"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelley|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The validity of sense perception, therefore, is not susceptible to proof (because it is presupposed by all proof as proof is only a matter of adducing sensory evidence) nor should its validity be denied (since the conceptual tools one would have to use to do this are derived from sensory data). Perceptual error, therefore, is not possible. Rand consequently rejected [[philosophical skepticism|epistemological skepticism]], as she holds that the skeptics' claim to knowledge "distorted" by the form or the means of perception is impossible.&lt;ref name="Kelley 1986"/&gt;

The Objectivist theory of perception distinguishes between the ''form'' and ''object.'' The form in which an organism perceives is determined by the physiology of its sensory systems. Whatever form the organism perceives it in, what it perceives—the object of perception—is reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelley|1986}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=44–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand consequently rejected the [[Kantianism|Kantian]] dichotomy between "things as we perceive them" and "things as they are in themselves." Says Rand, "The attack on man's consciousness and particularly on his conceptual faculty has rested on the unchallenged premise that any knowledge acquired by a ''process'' of consciousness is necessarily subjective and cannot correspond to the facts of reality, since it is ''"processed'' knowledge...[but] all knowledge ''is'' processed knowledge—whether on the sensory, perceptual or conceptual level. An "unprocessed" knowledge would be a knowledge acquired without means of cognition."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aspect of epistemology given the most elaboration by Rand is the theory of concept-formation, which she presented in ''[[Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology]]''. She argued that concepts are formed by a process of measurement omission. Peikoff described her view as follows:

{{quote|To form a concept, one mentally ''isolates'' a group of concretes (of distinct perceptual units), on the basis of observed similarities which distinguish them from all other known concretes (similarity is 'the relationship between two or more existents which possess the same characteristic(s), but in different measure or degree'); then, by a process of omitting the particular measurements of these concretes, one ''integrates'' them into a single new mental unit: the concept, which subsumes all concretes of this kind (a potentially unlimited number). The integration is completed and retained by the selection of a perceptual symbol (a word) to designate it. "A concept is a mental integration of two or more units possessing the same distinguishing characteristic(s), with their particular measurements omitted."&lt;ref&gt;Peikoff, Leonard. "The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy." in {{harvnb|Rand|1990|pp=97–98}}. The quotes within this passage are of Rand's material elsewhere in the same book.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Rand, "[T]he term 'measurements omitted' does not mean, in this context, that measurements are regarded as non-existent; it means that ''measurements exist, but are not specified''. That measurements ''must'' exist is an essential part of the process. The principle is: the relevant measurements must exist in ''some'' quantity, but may exist in ''any'' quantity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990|p=12}}; for more on Rand's theory of concepts see also Kelley, David "A Theory of Abstraction" and "The Psychology of Abstraction", ''Cognition and Brain Theory'' vol. vii, no. 3 and 4 (Summer/Fall 1984), and Rasmussen, Douglas B., "Quine and Aristotelian Essentialism," ''The New Scholasticism'' 58 (Summer, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand argued that concepts are hierarchically organized. Concepts such as 'dog,' which bring together "concretes" available in perception, can be differentiated (into the concepts of 'dachshund,' 'poodle,' etc.) or integrated (along with 'cat,' etc., into the concept of 'animal'). Abstract concepts such as 'animal' can be further integrated, via "abstraction from abstractions", into such concepts as 'living thing.' Concepts are formed in the context of knowledge available. A young child differentiates dogs from cats and chickens, but need not explicitly differentiate them from deep-sea tube worms, or from other types of animals not yet known to him, to form a concept 'dog.'&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990|pp=15–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its view of concepts as "open-ended" classifications that go well beyond the characteristics included in their past or current definitions, Objectivist epistemology rejects the [[Analytic–synthetic distinction|analytic-synthetic distinction]] as a false dichotomy&lt;ref&gt;Peikoff, Leonard. "The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy," in {{harvnb|Rand|1990|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; and denies the possibility of ''[[a priori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Peikoff, Leonard. "The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy". in {{harvnb|Rand|1990|pp=116–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand rejected "feeling" as sources of knowledge. Rand acknowledged the importance of emotion for human beings, but she maintained that emotions are a consequence of the conscious or subconscious ideas that a person already accepts, not a means of achieving awareness of reality. "Emotions are not tools of cognition."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1961|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand also rejected all forms of [[faith]] or mysticism, terms that she used synonymously. She defined faith as "the acceptance of allegations without evidence or proof, either apart from or ''against'' the evidence of one's senses and reason... Mysticism is the claim to some non-sensory, non-rational, non-definable, non-identifiable means of knowledge, such as 'instinct,' 'intuition,' 'revelation,' or any form of 'just knowing.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1982|pp=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reliance on revelation is like reliance on a [[Ouija|Ouija board]]; it bypasses the need to show how it connects its results to reality. Faith, for Rand, is not a "short-cut" to knowledge, but a "short-circuit" destroying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1961|p=223}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=182–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectivism acknowledges the facts that human beings have limited knowledge, are vulnerable to error, and do not instantly understand all of the implications of their knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Lecture by Leonard Peikoff, cited in {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peikoff, one can be certain of a proposition if all of the available evidence supports it, i.e., it can be logically integrated with the rest of one's knowledge; one is then certain within the context of the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=171–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand rejected the traditional [[rationalism|rationalist]]/[[empiricism|empiricist]] dichotomy, arguing that it embodies a false alternative: conceptually-based knowledge independent of perception (rationalism) versus perceptually-based knowledge independent of concepts (empiricism). Rand argued that neither is possible because the senses provide the material of knowledge while conceptual processing is also needed to establish knowable propositions.

====Criticisms on epistemology====
The philosopher [[John Hospers]], who was influenced by Rand and shared her moral and political views, disagreed with her over issues of epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1987|p=323}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some philosophers, such as [[Tibor Machan]], have argued that the Objectivist epistemology is incomplete.&lt;ref name="tiborneedwork"&gt;For example, {{harvnb|Machan|2000|pp=134–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychology professor Robert L. Campbell says the relationship between Objectivist epistemology and cognitive science remains unclear because Rand made claims about human cognition and its development which belong to psychology, yet Rand also argued that philosophy is logically prior to psychology and in no way dependent on it.&lt;ref name="itoephilpsych"&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cogrev"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Campbell |first=R.

The philosophers Randall Dipert and [[Roderick Long]] have argued that Objectivist epistemology conflates the perceptual process by which judgments are formed with the way in which they are to be justified, thereby leaving it unclear how sensory data can validate propositionally structured judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dipert |first=Randall R. |date=Spring 1987 |title=Review Essay: David Kelley's ''Evidence of the Senses: A Realist Theory of Perception'' |journal=Reason Papers |issue=12 |pages=57–70 |url=http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/12/rp_12_7.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reason and Value: Rand versus Aristotle |last=Long |first=Roderick T. |authorlink=Roderick Long |location=Poughkeepsie, New York |publisher=The Objectivist Center |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-57724-045-7 |oclc=49875339 |series=Objectivist Studies Monographs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectivism includes an extensive treatment of ethical concerns. Rand wrote on morality in her works ''The Virtue of Selfishness,'' ''We the Living,'' and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''. Rand defines morality as "a code of values to guide man's choices and actions—the choices and actions that determine the purpose and the course of his life."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand maintained that the first question is not what should the code of values be, the first question is "Does man need values at all—and why?" According to Rand, "it is only the concept of 'Life' that makes the concept of 'Value' possible," and, "the fact that a living entity ''is'', determines what it ''ought'' to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=18}}; for more on Rand's metaethics see {{harvnb|Binswanger|1990|pp=58–66}}, {{harvnb|Smith|2000}} and {{harvnb|Gotthelf|Lennox|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand writes: "there is only one fundamental alternative in the universe: existence or non-existence—and it pertains to a single class of entities: to living organisms. The existence of inanimate matter is unconditional, the existence of life is not: it depends on a specific course of action... It is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative: the issue of life or death..."

Rand argued that the primary focus of man's [[free will]] is in the choice: 'to think or not to think'. "Thinking is not an automatic function. In any hour and issue of his life, man is free to think or to evade that effort. Thinking requires a state of full, focused awareness. The act of focusing one's consciousness is volitional. Man can focus his mind to a full, active, purposefully directed awareness of reality—or he can unfocus it and let himself drift in a semiconscious daze, merely reacting to any chance stimulus of the immediate moment, at the mercy of his undirected sensory-perceptual mechanism and of any random, associational connections it might happen to make."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=22}}; for more on Rand's theory of volition, see {{harvnb|Binswanger|1991}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1969}}; and {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=55–72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rand, therefore, possessing free will, human beings must ''choose'' their values: one does not ''automatically'' hold one's own life as his ultimate value. Whether in fact a person's actions promote and fulfill his own life or not is a question of fact, as it is with all other organisms, but whether a person will act to promote his well-being is up to him, not hard-wired into his physiology. "Man has the power to act as his own destroyer—and that is the way he has acted through most of his history."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Says Rand, "Man's mind is his basic tool of survival. Life is given to him, survival is not. His body is given to him, its sustenance is not. His mind is given to him, its content is not. To remain alive he must act and before he can act he must know the nature and purpose of his action. He cannot obtain his food without knowledge of food and of the way to obtain it. He cannot dig a ditch—or build a cyclotron—without a knowledge of his aim and the means to achieve it. To remain alive, he must think."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her novels, ''The Fountainhead'' and ''Atlas Shrugged'', she also emphasizes the central importance of productive work, romantic love and art to human happiness, and dramatizes the ethical character of their pursuit. The primary virtue in Objectivist ethics is [[rationality]], as Rand meant it "the recognition and acceptance of reason as one's only source of knowledge, one's only judge of values and one's only guide to action."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of a moral code, Rand held, is to provide the principles by reference to which man can achieve the values his survival requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand summarizes:

{{quote|If [man] chooses to live, a rational ethics will tell him what principles of action are required to implement his choice. If he does not choose to live, nature will take its course. Reality confronts a man with a great many "must's", but all of them are conditional: the formula of realistic necessity is: "you must, if&amp;nbsp;–" and the if stands for man's choice: "if you want to achieve a certain goal".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1982|pp=118–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rand's explanation of values presents the view that an individual's primary moral obligation is to achieve his own well-being—it is for his life and his self-interest that an individual ought to adhere to a moral code.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2006|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethical egoism]] is a corollary of setting man's life as the moral standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand believed that rational egoism is the [[logical consequence]] of humans following evidence wherever it leads them. The only alternative would be that they live without orientation to reality.

A corollary to Rand's endorsement of self-interest is her rejection of the [[Altruism (ethics)|ethical doctrine of altruism]]—which she defined in the sense of [[Auguste Comte]]'s altruism (he coined the term), as a moral obligation to live for the sake of others. Rand also rejected subjectivism. A "whim-worshiper" or "hedonist," according to Rand, is not motivated by a desire to live his own human life, but by a wish to live on a sub-human level. Instead of using "that which promotes my (human) life" as his standard of value, he mistakes "that which I (mindlessly happen to) value" for a standard of value, in contradiction of the fact that, existentially, he is a human and therefore rational organism. The "I value" in whim-worship or hedonism can be replaced with "we value," "he values," "they value," or "God values," and still it would remain dissociated from reality. Rand repudiated the equation of rational selfishness with hedonistic or whim-worshiping "selfishness-without-a-self."  She held that the former is good, and the latter evil, and that there is a fundamental difference between them.&lt;ref name="vos"&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Rand, all of the principal [[virtue]]s are applications of the role of reason as man's basic tool of survival: rationality, honesty, justice, independence, integrity, productiveness, and pride—each of which she explains in some detail in "The Objectivist Ethics."&lt;ref&gt;See also {{harvnb|Smith|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essence of Objectivist ethics is summarized by the oath her ''Atlas Shrugged'' character John Galt adhered to: "I swear—by my life and my love of it—that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticisms on ethics====
Many philosophers have criticized Objectivist ethics. The philosopher [[Robert Nozick]] argues that Rand's foundational argument in ethics is unsound because it does not explain why someone could not rationally prefer dying and having no values. He argues that her attempt to defend the morality of selfishness is, therefore, an instance of [[begging the question]]. Nozick also argues that Rand's solution to [[David Hume]]'s famous [[is-ought problem]] is unsatisfactory. In response, the philosophers [[Douglas B. Rasmussen]] and [[Douglas Den Uyl]] have argued that Nozick misstated Rand's case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ayn Rand and the Is-Ought Problem |last=O'Neil |first=Patrick M. |journal=Journal of Libertarian Studies |date=Spring 1983 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=81–99 |url=https://www.mises.org/sites/default/files/7_1_4_0.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nozick On the Randian Argument |last1=Den Uyl |first1=Douglas |last2=Rasmussen |first2=Douglas |journal=The Personalist |date=April 1978 |volume=59 |pages=184–205}} Reprinted along with Nozick's article in ''Reading Nozick'', J. Paul, ed., 1981, [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles King criticized Rand's example of an indestructible robot to demonstrate the value of life as incorrect and confusing.&lt;ref&gt;King, J. Charles. "Life and the Theory of Value: The Randian Argument Reconsidered" in {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Paul St. F. Blair defended Rand's ethical conclusions, while maintaining that his arguments might not have been approved by Rand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/10/rp_10_7.pdf |title=The Randian Argument Reconsidered: A Reply to Charles King |first=Paul |last=St. F. Blair |journal=Reason Papers |date=Spring 1985 |issue=10 |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics: individual rights and capitalism===
Rand's defense of individual liberty integrates elements from her entire philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=354}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since reason is the means of human knowledge, it is therefore each person's most fundamental means of survival and is necessary to the achievement of values.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|2009|pp=25–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use or threat of [[Force (law)|force]] neutralizes the practical effect of an individual's reason, whether the force originates from the state or from a criminal. According to Rand, "man's mind will not function at the point of a gun."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1967|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the only type of organized human behavior consistent with the operation of reason is that of voluntary cooperation. Persuasion is the method of reason. By its nature, the overtly irrational cannot rely on the use of persuasion and must ultimately resort to force to prevail.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=310–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Rand saw reason and freedom as correlates, just as she saw mysticism and force as corollaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1982|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this understanding of the role of reason, Objectivists hold that the initiation of physical force against the will of another is immoral,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=36}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=310}}; {{harvnb|Smith|1997|pp=143–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are indirect initiations of force through threats,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1997|pp=150–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; fraud,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; or breach of contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|pp=129–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of defensive or retaliatory force, on the other hand, is appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=126}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectivism holds that because the opportunity to use reason without the initiation of force is necessary to achieve moral values, each individual has an inalienable moral [[natural and legal rights|right]] to act as his own judgment directs and to keep the product of his effort. Peikoff, explaining the basis of rights, stated, "In content, as the founding fathers recognized, there is one fundamental right, which has several major derivatives. The fundamental right is the right to life. Its major derivatives are the right to liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=351–52}}. The Objectivist understanding of rights is explored at length in {{harvnb|Smith|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "A 'right' is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man's freedom of action in a social context."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights are specifically understood to be rights to action, not to specific results or objects, and the obligations created by rights are negative in nature: each individual must refrain from violating the rights of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objectivists reject alternative notions of rights, such as [[positive rights]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1997|pp=165–82}}; {{harvnb|Touchstone|2006|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[collective rights]], or [[animal rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=356–58}}; {{harvnb|Rand|1964|pp=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objectivism holds that the only social system which fully recognizes individual rights is capitalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1967|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically what Rand described as "full, pure, uncontrolled, unregulated laissez-faire capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objectivism regards capitalism as the social system which is most beneficial to the poor, but does not consider this its primary justification.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=392–395}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, it is the only moral social system.

Objectivism views government as "the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control—i.e., under objectively defined laws;" thus, government is both legitimate and critically important&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to protect individual rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|pp=125–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand opposed [[anarchism]] because she saw putting police and courts on the market as an inherent miscarriage of [[justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Objectivism holds that the proper functions of a government are "''the police'', to protect men from criminals—''[[military|the armed services]]'', to protect men from foreign invaders—''[[courts|the law courts]]'', to settle disputes among men according to objectively defined laws," the [[Executive (government)|executive]], and [[legislatures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in protecting individual rights, the government is acting as an agent of its citizens and "has no rights except the rights ''delegated'' to it by the citizens"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it must act in an impartial manner according to specific, objectively defined laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=128}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=364–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Objectivists Peikoff and [[Yaron Brook]] have since expressed support for other government functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peikoff.com/2011/03/07/what-role-should-certain-specific-governments-play-in-objectivist-government/|title=What role should certain specific governments play in Objectivist government?

Rand argued that limited [[intellectual property rights|intellectual property]] monopolies being granted to certain inventors and artists on a first-to-file basis are moral because she viewed all property as fundamentally intellectual. Furthermore, the value of a commercial product comes in part from the necessary work of its inventors. However, Rand viewed limits on patents and copyrights as important and held that if they were granted in perpetuity, it would necessarily lead to ''de facto'' collectivism.

Rand opposed [[racism]] and any legal application of racism. She considered [[affirmative action]] to be an example of legal racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|pp=173–84}}; ''cf''. {{cite book |title=The Other Side of Racism |last=Wortham |first=Anne |location=Columbus, Ohio |publisher=Ohio State University Press |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-8142-0318-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand advocated the right to legal [[abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |chapter=Of Living Death |others=Edited by Leonard Peikoff |title=The Voice of Reason |location=New York |publisher=New American Library |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-453-00634-7|title-link=The Voice of Reason (book) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand believed [[capital punishment]] is morally justified as retribution against a murderer, but dangerous due to the risk of mistakenly executing innocent people and opening the door to state murder. She therefore said she opposed capital punishment "on epistemological, not moral, grounds."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|2005|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; She opposed involuntary [[military conscription]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1967|pp=226–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; She opposed any form of [[censorship]], including legal restrictions on [[pornography]], [[freedom of opinion|opinion]] or [[freedom to worship|worship]], famously quipping; "In the transition to statism, every infringement of human rights has begun with a given right's least attractive practitioners".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1982|pp=173–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/free_speech.html|title=Free Speech|website=Ayn Rand Lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectivists have also opposed a number of government activities commonly supported by both liberals and conservatives, including [[antitrust]] laws,&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, Alan.

====Criticisms on politics====
Some critics, including economists and political philosophers such as, [[Murray Rothbard]], [[David D. Friedman]], [[Roy Childs]], [[Norman P. Barry]], and [[Chandran Kukathas]], have argued that Objectivist ethics are consistent with [[anarcho-capitalism]] instead of [[minarchism]].&lt;ref&gt;Childs, Roy (1969). "[http://www.isil.org/ayn-rand/childs-open-letter.html Objectivism and The State: An Open Letter to Ayn Rand]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barry|1987|pp=128–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kukathas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=250–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/easaran/chap3.asp |last=Rothbard |first=Murray N. |title=Anatomy of the State: What the State Is Not |website=Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics: metaphysical value-judgments===
{{See also|Romantic realism}}
The Objectivist theory of [[art]] flows from its epistemology, by way of "psycho-epistemology" (Rand's term for an individual's characteristic mode of functioning in acquiring knowledge). Art, according to Objectivism, serves a human cognitive need: it allows human beings to grasp concepts as though they were [[percept]]s. Objectivism defines "art" as a "selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments"—that is, according to what the artist believes to be ultimately true and important about the nature of reality and humanity. In this respect Objectivism regards art as a way of presenting abstractions concretely, in perceptual form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human need for art, on this view, stems from the need for cognitive economy. A concept is already a sort of mental shorthand standing for a large number of concretes, allowing a human being to think indirectly or implicitly of many more such concretes than can be held explicitly in mind. But a human being cannot hold indefinitely many concepts explicitly in mind either—and yet, on the Objectivist view, needs a comprehensive conceptual framework to provide guidance in life. Art offers a way out of this dilemma by providing a perceptual, easily grasped means of communicating and thinking about a wide range of abstractions, including one's metaphysical value-judgments. Objectivism regards art as an effective way to communicate a moral or ethical ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=422}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objectivism does not, however, regard art as propagandistic: even though art involves moral values and ideals, its purpose is not to educate, only to show or project. Moreover, art need not be, and usually is not, the outcome of a full-blown, explicit philosophy. Usually it stems from an artist's ''sense of life'' (which is preconceptual and largely emotional).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end goal of Rand's own artistic endeavors was to portray the ideal man. ''The Fountainhead'' is the best example of this effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barr|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand uses the character of Roark to embody the concept of the higher man which she believes is what great art should do - embody the characteristics of the best of humanity. This higher symbolism should be represented in all art; artistic expression should be an extension of the greatness in humanity.

Rand held that Romanticism was the highest school of literary art, noting that Romanticism was "based on the recognition of the principle that man possesses the faculty of volition," absent which, Rand believed, literature is robbed of dramatic power, adding:

{{quote|What the Romanticists brought to art was the ''primacy of values''... Values are the source of emotions: a great deal of emotional intensity was projected in the work of the Romanticists and in the reactions of their audiences, as well as a great deal of color, imagination, originality, excitement, and all the other consequences of a value-oriented view of life.&lt;ref&gt;"What is Romanticism?" in {{harvnb|Rand|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term "romanticism," however, is often affiliated with emotionalism, to which Objectivism is completely opposed. Historically, many romantic artists were philosophically [[subjectivist]]. Most Objectivists who are also artists subscribe to what they call [[romantic realism]], which is how Rand labeled her own work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Torres|Kamhi|2000|pp=31–32}}; {{harvnb|Holzer|2005|pp=115–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several authors have developed and applied Rand's ideas in their own work. Rand described Peikoff's ''[[The Ominous Parallels]]'' (1982), as "the first book by an Objectivist philosopher other than myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1982|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Peikoff published ''[[Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand]]'', a comprehensive exposition of Rand's philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Matthew Sciabarra]] discusses Rand's ideas and theorizes about their intellectual origins in ''[[Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical]]'' (1995). Surveys such as ''[[On Ayn Rand]]'' by [[Allan Gotthelf]] (1999), ''Ayn Rand'' by [[Tibor R. Machan]] (2000), and ''Objectivism in One Lesson'' by [[Andrew Bernstein]] (2009) provide briefer introductions to Rand's ideas.

Some scholars have focused on applying Objectivism in more specific areas. Machan has developed Rand's contextual conception of human knowledge (while also drawing on the insights of [[J. L. Austin]] and [[Gilbert Harman]]) in works such as ''Objectivity'' (2004), and [[David Kelley]] has explicated Rand's epistemological ideas in works such as ''The Evidence of the Senses'' (1986) and ''A Theory of Abstraction'' (2001). In the field of ethics, Kelley has argued in works such as ''Unrugged Individualism'' (1996) and ''The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand'' (2000) that Objectivists should pay more attention to the virtue of benevolence and place less emphasis on issues of moral sanction. Kelley's views have been controversial, and critics Peikoff and [[Peter Schwartz (writer)|Peter Schwartz]] have argued that he contradicts important principles of Objectivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1989}}; {{harvnb|Schwartz|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelley has used the term "Open Objectivism" for a version of Objectivism that involves "a commitment to reasoned, non-dogmatic discussion and debate," "the recognition that Objectivism is open to expansion, refinement, and revision," and "a policy of benevolence toward others, including fellow-travelers and critics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlassociety.org/open_objectivism_david_kelley|website=Atlas Society|title=A Note to Our Members About Open Objectivism|date=October 17, 2008|last=Kelley|first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing against Kelley, Peikoff characterized Objectivism as a "closed system" that is not subject to change.&lt;ref name="Fact and Value"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fact and Value |journal=The Intellectual Activist |date=May 18, 1989 |volume=5 |issue=1 |first=Leonard |last=Peikoff |url=http://ari.aynrand.org/issues/culture-and-society/religion-and-morality/Fact-and-Value}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An author who focuses on Rand's ethics, [[Tara Smith (philosopher)|Tara Smith]], stays closer to Rand's original ideas in such works as ''Moral Rights and Political Freedom'' (1995), ''Viable Values'' (2000), and ''Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Comments on Tara Smith's ''Viable Values'' |accessdate=May 29, 2009 |date=December 2000 |url=http://enlightenment.supersaturated.com/essays/text/irfankhawaja/viablevaluescomment.html |first=Irfan |last=Khawaja}}; {{cite journal |title=Egoism Explained: A Review of Tara Smith's ''Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist'' |journal=The Objective Standard |date=Spring 2007 |volume=2 |issue=1 |url=http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2007-spring/egoism-explained.asp |first=Diana |last=Hsieh |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with Peikoff, David Harriman has developed a theory of [[scientific method|scientific]] [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] based upon Rand's theory of concepts in ''The Logical Leap: Induction in Physics'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;Harriman, David, ''The Logical Leap'', 2010, New American Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[political philosophy|political]] aspects of Rand's philosophy are discussed by Bernstein in ''The Capitalist Manifesto'' (2005). In ''Capitalism: A Treatise on Economics'' (1996), [[George Reisman]] attempts to integrate Objectivist methodology and insights with both [[Classical Economics|Classical]] and [[Austrian Economics|Austrian economics]]. In psychology, Professor [[Edwin A. Locke]] and Ellen Kenner have explored Rand's ideas in ''The Selfish Path to Romance: How to Love with Passion &amp; Reason''.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, Edwin, and Kenner, Ellen, Platform, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers have explored the application of Objectivism to fields ranging from [[aesthetics|art]], as in ''What Art Is'' by Louis Torres and [[Michelle Marder Kamhi]] (2000), to [[teleology]], as in ''The Biological Basis of Teleological Concepts'' by [[Harry Binswanger]] (1990).

Academic philosophers have generally dismissed Objectivism since Rand first presented it.&lt;ref name="academic"/&gt; Objectivism has been called "fiercely anti-academic" because of Rand's criticism of contemporary intellectuals.&lt;ref name="McLemee"/&gt; [[David Sidorsky]], a professor of moral and political philosophy at Columbia University, says Rand's work is "outside the mainstream" and is more of an ideological movement than a well-grounded philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harvey |first=Benjamin |url=http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050515/NEWS/505150346/1014 |title=Ayn Rand at 100: An 'ism' struts its stuff |publisher=''[[Rutland Herald]]'' |date=May 15, 2005 |accessdate=July 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226153815/http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050515%2FNEWS%2F505150346%2F1014# |archive-date=December 26, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; British philosopher [[Ted Honderich]] notes that he deliberately excluded an article on Rand from ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'' (Rand is, however, mentioned in the article on popular philosophy by [[Anthony Quinton, Baron Quinton|Anthony Quinton]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Honderich|2005|pp=x, 740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand is the subject of entries in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'',&lt;ref name="Badhwar 2010"/&gt; ''The Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers'',&lt;ref name=dmap&gt;{{harvnb|Salmieri|Gotthelf|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hicks|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Routledge Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Political Thinkers'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stevens|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;Mautner, Thomas. ''The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy''. Penguin Books, 2000, p. 469.&lt;/ref&gt; A listing of Rand also appears in the ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', featuring the assessment, "The influence of Rand's ideas was strongest among college students in the USA but attracted little attention from academic philosophers. Her outspoken defense of capitalism in works like ''[[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]]'' (1967), and her characterization of her position as a defence of the 'virtue of selfishness' in her [[The Virtue of Selfishness|essay collection of the same title]] published in 1964, also brought notoriety, but kept her out of the intellectual mainstream."&lt;ref name="Kukathas"&gt;{{harvnb|Kukathas|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parramatta, founded by the British in 1788, the same year as Sydney, is the oldest inland European settlement in Australia and the economic capital of [[Greater Western Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parracity.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/91941/VISITOR_STRATEGY_for_Parramatta2011-2016.pdf|title=Visitor Strategy for Parramatta 2011–2016|publisher=City of Parramatta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000, government agencies such as the [[New South Wales Police Force]] and [[Sydney Water]]&lt;ref name="Media Release"&gt;[http://www.sydneywater.com.au/whoweare/MediaCentre/MediaView.cfm?ID=446 Media Release&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722002646/http://www.sydneywater.com.au/WhoWeAre/MediaCentre/MediaView.cfm?ID=446 |date=22 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have relocated to Parramatta from the centre of Sydney.

Parramatta is a major business and commercial centre, and home to [[Westfield Parramatta]], the [[List of shopping centres in Australia by size#List of shopping centres in Australia by gross leasable area|ninth largest shopping centre in Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.westfield.com.au/parramatta |title=Westfield Parramatta |publisher=Westfield Group |year=2017 |accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parramatta is also the major transport hub for Western Sydney, servicing trains and buses, as well as having a ferry wharf and future light rail and metro services. Major upgrades have occurred around [[Parramatta railway station]] with the creation of a new transport interchange, and the ongoing development of the Parramatta Square local government precinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to Parramatta NSW Australia|url=http://www.cityofparramatta.com/|publisher=cityofparramatta.com|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Aboriginal===
[[Radiocarbon dating]] suggests human activity occurred in Parramatta from around 30,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Settlers' history rewritten"&gt;{{cite news |last=Macey |first=Richard |date=2007 |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/settlers-history-rewritten/2007/09/14/1189276983698.html |title=Settlers' history rewritten: go back 30,000 years |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Darug people]] who lived in the area before European settlement regarded the area as rich in food from the river and forests. They called the area Baramada or Burramatta ('Parramatta') which means "head of waters",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/444568/Parramatta|title=Parramatta - New South Wales, Australia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the place where the eels lie down"&lt;ref name="gnbsuburb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Troy |first=Jakelin |chapter=The Sydney Language |title=Macquarie Aboriginal Words |location=Sydney |publisher=Macquarie Library |pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "eel waters".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darug.org.au/DarugLanguage.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  To this day many eels and other sea creatures are attracted to nutrients that are concentrated where the saltwater of [[Port Jackson]] meets the freshwater of the [[Parramatta River]]. The [[Parramatta Eels]] [[rugby league|Rugby League]] club chose their symbol as a result of this phenomenon.

Parramatta was founded in 1788, the same year as Sydney. As such, Parramatta is the second oldest city in Australia, being only 10 months younger than Sydney. The British Colonists, who had arrived in January 1788 on the [[First Fleet]] at [[Sydney Cove]], had only enough food to support themselves for a short time and the soil around Sydney Cove proved too poor to grow the amount of food that 1,000 [[convicts in Australia|convicts]], soldiers and administrators needed to survive. During 1788, Governor [[Arthur Phillip]] had reconnoitred several places before choosing Parramatta as the most likely place for a successful large farm.&lt;ref&gt;"Man of Honour – John Macarthur", Michael Duffy, Macmillan 2003, p. 81 ff&lt;/ref&gt; Parramatta was the furthest navigable point inland on the Parramatta River (i.e. furthest from the thin, sandy coastal soil) and also the point at which the river became freshwater and therefore useful for farming.

On Sunday 2 November 1788, Governor Phillip took a detachment of marines along with a surveyor and, in boats, made his way upriver to a location that he called The Crescent, a defensible hill curved round a river bend, now in [[Parramatta Park, New South Wales|Parramatta Park]]. As a settlement developed, Governor Phillip gave it the name "Rose Hill" after British politician [[George Rose (politician)|George Rose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51780016 |title=The romance of Australian place names. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] | date=27 May 1964 |accessdate=14 October 2013 |page=59 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 June 1791 Phillip changed the name of the township to Parramatta, approximating the term used by the local Aboriginal people.&lt;ref name="Papers and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Tasmania, volume 105"&gt;{{cite web|author1=E. R. Pretyman|title=SOME NOTES ON THE LIFE AND TIMES OF CAPTAIN JAMES KELLY|url=https://eprints.utas.edu.au/13417/1/1971_Pretyman_Life_and_times_Captain_James_Kelly.pdf|accessdate=15 March 2018|date=7 July 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; A neighbouring suburb acquired the name "Rose Hill", which today is spelt "[[Rosehill, New South Wales|Rosehill]]". 

In an attempt to deal with the food crisis, Phillip in 1789 granted a convict named [[James Ruse]] the land of [[Experiment Farm]] at Parramatta on the condition that he develop a viable agriculture. There, Ruse became the first person to successfully grow grain in Australia. The Parramatta area was also the site of the pioneering of the Australian wool industry by [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]]'s  [[Elizabeth Farm]] in the 1790s. [[Philip Gidley King]]'s account of his visit to Parramatta on 9 April 1790 is one of the earliest descriptions of the area. Walking four miles with Governor Phillip to Prospect, he saw undulating grassland interspersed with magnificent trees and a great number of [[kangaroos]] and [[emu]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn 1997, p 28&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Battle of Parramatta]], a major battle of the [[Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars]], occurred in March 1797 where [[Resistance movement|resistance]] leader [[Pemulwuy]] led a group of [[Bidjigal]] warriors, estimated to be at least 100, in an attack on a government farm at [[Toongabbie]], challenging the [[British Army]] to fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | newspaper = "The Sun Herald" | date = 16 February 2008 | url = http://blogs.sunherald.com.au/whoweare/archives/2008/03/who_we_are_the_11.html | title = WHO WE ARE: The man who nearly changed everything | first = David | last = Dale}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Henniker Heaton, ''Australian Dictionary of Dates and Men of the Time'', Sydney, 1873&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Arthur Phillip built a small house for himself on the hill of The Crescent. In 1799 this was replaced by a larger residence which, substantially improved by Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] from 1815 to 1818, has survived to the present day, making it the oldest surviving Government House anywhere in Australia. It was used as a retreat by Governors until the 1850s, with one Governor ([[Thomas Brisbane|Governor Brisbane]]) making it his principal home for a short period in the 1820s. 

In 1803, another famous incident occurred in Parramatta, involving a convicted criminal named [[Joseph Samuel]], originally from England. Samuel was convicted of murder and sentenced to death by hanging, but the rope broke. In the second attempt, the noose slipped off his neck. In the third attempt, the new rope broke. Governor King was summoned and pardoned Samuel, as the incident appeared to him to be [[Miracle|divine intervention]].&lt;ref name="HERALD SATURDAY MAGAZINE"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27523294 |title="HERALD" SATURDAY MAGAZINE. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=26 September 1953 |accessdate=30 June 2014 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1814, Macquarie opened a school for Aboriginal children at Parramatta as part of a policy of improving relations between Aboriginal and European communities. This school was later relocated to [[Blacktown|"Black Town"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Norman |first1=Heidi |title=Parramatta and Black Town Native Institutions |date=2015 |url=http://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/parramatta_and_black_town_native_institutions |website=Dictionary of Sydney |publisher=Dictionary of Sydney Trust |accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
Parramatta has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Cfa'') with mild to cool winters and warm, sometimes hot summers, and rainfall spread throughout the year.

Depending on the [[wind direction]], summer weather may be [[humid]] or [[Drought|dry]], though the humidity is mostly in the comfortable range, with the late summer/autumn period having a higher average humidity than late winter/early spring. Summer maximum temperatures are quite variable, often reaching above {{cvt|35|C|F}}, on average 8.1 days in summer, and sometimes remaining in the low 20s, especially after a [[cold front]] or a [[sea breeze]], such as the [[southerly|southerly buster]].

Northwesterlies can occasionally bring hot winds from the [[Australian desert|desert]] that can raise temperatures higher than {{cvt|40|C|F}} mostly from November to February. Parramatta is slightly warmer than [[Sydney CBD]] in the summer due to the [[urban heat island effect]] and its inland location. In extreme cases though, it can be {{cvt|5–10|C-change|0}} warmer than Sydney, especially when sea breezes do not penetrate inland on hot summer and spring days. For example, on 28 November 2009, the city reached {{cvt|29.3|C|F}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Daily Maximum Temperature - 066062 |publisher=Bureau of Meteorology |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/cdio/weatherData/av?p_nccObsCode=122&amp;p_display_type=dailyDataFile&amp;p_startYear=2009&amp;p_c=-872833047&amp;p_stn_num=066062 |website=www.bom.gov.au| access-date=2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Parramatta reached {{cvt|39.0|C|F}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Daily Maximum Temperature - 066124 |publisher=Bureau of Meteorology |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/cdio/weatherData/av?p_nccObsCode=122&amp;p_display_type=dailyDataFile&amp;p_startYear=2009&amp;p_c=-874472154&amp;p_stn_num=066124 |website = www.bom.gov.au |access-date=2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; almost {{cvt|10|C-change}} higher.

Rainfall is fairly evenly divided between summer and winter, but is slightly higher during the first three months of the year, when easterly winds dominate. The second half of the year tends to be drier (late winter/spring), that is when westerly winds dominate, which bring drier conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap16/sydney_clim.html|title=The climate of Sydney, Australia|website=www-das.uwyo.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunderstorms are common in the months from early spring to early autumn, occasionally quite severe thunderstorms can occur. Snow is virtually unknown, having been recorded only in 1836 and 1896&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackheathweather.com/bmsnowhistory1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Parrammatta gets 106.6 days of clear skies annually.

Since 2000, Parramatta has seen the consolidation of its role as a government centre, with the relocation of agencies such as the [[New South Wales Police Force]] Headquarters and the Sydney Water Corporation&lt;ref name="Media Release" /&gt; from [[Sydney CBD]]. At the same time, major construction work occurred around the [[Parramatta railway station|railway station]] with the expansion of Westfield Shoppingtown and the creation of a new transport interchange. The western part of the Parramatta CBD is known as the [[Parramatta Justice Precinct]] and houses the corporate headquarters of the [[Department of Attorney General and Justice (New South Wales)|New South Wales Department of Attorney General and Justice]].

==Parks==
[[Parramatta Park, New South Wales|Parramatta Park]] is a large park adjacent to [[Parramatta Stadium]] that is a popular venue for walking, jogging and bike riding. It was formerly the Governor's Domain, being land set aside for the Governor to supply his farming needs, until it was gazetted as a public park in 1858&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Celebrating 160 Years |url=https://www.parrapark.com.au/about-us/160-years/ |website=Parramatta Park |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As the Governor's Domain, the grounds were considerably larger than the current 85 hectare Parramatta Park, extending from Parramatta Road in the south as evident by a small gatehouse adjacent to Parramatta High School. For a time Parramatta Park housed a zoo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arc.parracity.nsw.gov.au/blog/2017/10/23/wild-things-the-history-of-parramatta-zoo/|title=Wild things: The history of Parramatta Zoo|date=23 October 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1951 when the animals were transferred to [[Taronga Zoo]].

Parramatta is known as the 'River City' as the [[Parramatta River]] flows through the Parramatta CBD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Central River City vision |url=https://www.greater.sydney/portal/metropolis-three-cities/vision-metropolis-three-cities/central-river-city-vision |publisher=Greater Sydney Commission |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its foreshore features a playground, seating, picnic tables and pathways that are increasingly popular with residents, visitors and CBD workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cityofparramatta.nsw.gov.au/council/precinct-planning/parramatta-cbd/city-river-foreshore|title=City River Foreshore |publisher=City of Parramatta Council |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Prince Alfred Square]] is a [[Victorian era]] park located within the CBD on the northern side of the [[Parramatta River]]. It is one of the oldest public parks in [[New South Wales]] with trees dating from circa 1869. Prior to being a public park, it was the site of Parramatta's second gaol from 1804 until 1841 and the first female factory in Australia between 1804 and 1821.

===Light rail===
The two-line [[Parramatta Light Rail]] project was announced in 2015. Lines originating from Carlingford and Olympic Park via Wentworth Point will form a combined route at Rydalmere or Camellia and pass through Parramatta before terminating at Westmead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parramatta Light Rail - How the preferred network was chosen|url=http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/parramatta-light-rail/how-preferred-network-was-chosen|publisher=Transport for NSW|accessdate=8 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210184912/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/parramatta-light-rail/how-preferred-network-was-chosen|archivedate=10 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Constance|first1=Andrew|url=https://twitter.com/AndrewConstance/status/920478958671372288|title=We're planning light rail extension to Sydney Olympic Park to improve public transport for 1000's[sic] of event goers|website=Twitter|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Road===
[[Parramatta Road]] has always been an important thoroughfare for Sydney from its earliest days. From Parramatta the major western road for the state is the [[Great Western Highway]]. The [[M4 Western Motorway]], running parallel to the Great Western Highway has taken much of the traffic away from these roads, with entrance and exit ramps close to Parramatta.

[[James Ruse Drive]] serves as a partial ring-road circling around the eastern part of Parramatta to join with the [[Cumberland Highway]] to the north west of the city.

The main north-south route through Parramatta is Church Street. To the north it becomes [[Windsor, New South Wales|Windsor]] Road, and to the south it becomes Woodville Road.

Parramatta Park contains Old Government House and thus Parramatta was once the capital of the colony of [[New South Wales]] until Governors returned to residing in Sydney in 1846.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldgovernmenthouse.com.au/index.php?page=timeline_ogh/|title=Old Government House|website=www.oldgovernmenthouse.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another feature is the natural amphitheatre located on one of the bends of the river, named by Governor Philip as "the Crescent", which is used to stage concerts. It is home to the [[Dairy Cottage, Parramatta|Dairy Cottage]], built from 1798 to 1805, originally a single-room cottage and is one of the earliest surviving cottages in Australia.

The remains of Governor Brisbane's private astronomical observatory, constructed in 1822, are visible. Astronomers who worked at the observatory, discovering thousands of new stars and [[deep sky]] objects, include [[James Dunlop]] and [[Carl Ludwig Christian Rümker|Carl Rümker]]. In 1822, the architect S. L. Harris designed the Bath House for Governor Brisbane and built it in 1823. Water was pumped to the building through lead pipes from the river. In 1886, it was converted into a pavilion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppt.nsw.gov.au/|title=Plone|website=www.ppt.nsw.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parramatta is the home of several professional sports teams. These teams include the [[Parramatta Eels]] of the [[National Rugby League]] and [[Western Sydney Wanderers FC|Western Sydney Wanderers]] of the [[A-League]]. Both teams formerly played matches at [[Parramatta Stadium]] that has now been demolished and is currently being replaced with the 30,000 seat [[Western Sydney Stadium]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://infrastructure.nsw.gov.au/projects-nsw/western-sydney-stadium.aspx|title=Infrastructure NSW : Western Sydney Stadium|last=NSW|first=Infrastructure|website=Infrastructure NSW|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Parramatta Stadium was also home to the now dissolved [[Sydney Wave]] of the former [[Australian Baseball League (1989–99)|Australian Baseball League]] and [[Parramatta Power SC|Parramatta Power]] of the former [[National Soccer League]].

[[File:Peralta ramos.jpg|thumb|Patricio Peralta Ramos]]
'''Patricio Peralta Ramos''' (May 17, 1814{{spaced ndash}}April 25, 1887) was an Argentine businessman and landowner prominent in the foundation of the seaside city of [[Mar del Plata]].

==Life and times==
Patricio Peralta Ramos was born in the [[San Nicolás, Buenos Aires|San Nicolás]], a [[Buenos Aires]] neighbourhood, in 1814. His father, José de Peralta, was a high-ranking official of the [[1st Infantry Regiment (Argentina)|Patricios Regiment]]. In 1860, he married a distant relative, Cecilia Ramos, with whom he had twelve children.

Peralta Ramos became a large clothing supplier to the [[Argentine Army]] during the 1829-52 regime of Governor [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], of whom Peralta Ramos became an official supporter in 1842. A wealthy man by the time of Rosas' overthrow at the 1852 [[Battle of Caseros]], he traveled in 1860 to the Atlantic Ocean shore, where he purchased over 136,000 hectares (340,000 acres) from [[Portugal|Portuguese]] Consul and entrepreneur José Coelho de Meyrelles, and a meat salting house.&lt;ref name=punto&gt;[http://www.puntomardelplata.com/historia-marplatense.asp ''Punto Mar del Plata: Reseña histórica marplatense'' {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[Jerky (food)|beef jerky]] facility struggling, Peralta Ramos embarked on the initial real estate development of his vast, scenic land. His enterprise met with the resistance of the gentry of [[Balcarce, Buenos Aires|Balcarce]] (then the county seat), though in 1865, he obtained a favorable ruling for the shoreline development from the local [[Justice of Peace]], Juan Peña. Seizing on a discrepancy between Peralta Ramos' holdings and what appeared in the official appraisal, Balcarce founder and Mayor José Chaves nearly forced his adversary to relocate his planned development on [[marshland]], but an 1867 letter in Peralta Ramos' support by neighboring [[Mar Chiquita]] Judge José Bernal to [[Buenos Aires Province]] official [[Nicolás Avellaneda]] settled the dispute in Peralta Ramos' favor.&lt;ref name=punto/&gt;
[[File:Playa Bristol - Mar del Plata- Ca 1910.jpg|left|thumb|232px|Mar del Plata's Bristol Beach, around 1910]]
Advertising the development as ''Puerto de la Laguna de los Padres,'' the sale of allotments was successful, and in 1873, Peralta Ramos petitioned the province for the seaside hamlet's incorporation, which was granted by Governor [[Mariano Acosta (politician)|Mariano Acosta]] on February 10, 1874, as ''Puerto Balcarce''. As this nomenclature was assigned over his objections, Peralta Ramos unofficially christened the community ''Mar del Plata'' (in the sense of "Sea of the [[Rio de la Plata basin|River Plate region]]").&lt;ref&gt;''Creemos, sin embargo, que por ser el primer contacto que los hombres del Río de la Plata tomaron con el mar se llamó a este punto precisamente mar "del Plata".''  Cova, Roberto Osvaldo:''Síntesis histórica de Mar del Plata: notas para el conocimiento del origen, evolución y desarrollo de la ciudad y de la zona.'' 1969, p. 8 {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accomplishment was clouded, however, by the death of his wife, Cecilia, in honor of whom Peralta Ramos personally designed and built the [[Saint Cecilia]] Chapel; the structure, poignantly, was built by the mourning widower from wooden planks salvaged from a recent wreckage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turismania.com.ar/DESCUBRA/pages/fundacion/fundacion.asp ''Turismania: Fundación de Mar del Plata'' {{es icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008181100/http://www.turismania.com.ar/DESCUBRA/pages/fundacion/fundacion.asp |date=2009-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boasting seaside appeal, an iron [[pier]] and made self-sufficient by the salting house, as well as by a flour mill, bakery, blacksmith and other establishments, the community prospered. In his later years, Peralta Ramos promoted the hunt of the area's then-vast herds of [[South American Sea Lion|sea lions]], which he termed "an inexhaustible source of wealth."&lt;ref&gt;''Centenario del natalicio del fundador de Mar del Plata Don Patricio Peralta Ramos.''&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Mar del Plata in 1887, and his remains were buried initially at Saint Cecilia chapel and some years later reburied at the [[La Recoleta Cemetery]] in Buenos Aires.

==The Queen Rania Center for Entrepreneurship==
[[File:QRCE logo.jpg|right|250px|PSUT's UDO logo]]
The establishment [[Queen Rania]] Center for Entrepreneurship is an integral part of the expansion plan of PSUT. The idea was to name the Center after a prominent Arab dignitary known for his/her distinguished role in developing entrepreneurship. Thus, work towards launching the Queen Rania Center for Entrepreneurship (QRCE) started in October 2004. This state of the art center will be located at the heart of Jordan's [[scientific]], [[academic]] and [[R&amp;D]] corridor. Furthermore, the center will extend its services to cover not only [[Jordan]] but the region as a whole.

The center is planned to be the regions' cornerstone for [[technology commercialization]] and [[entrepreneurship]] development. The QRCE will target university students, [[research]]ers, [[innovators]], [[entrepreneur]]s and others. According to PSUT's development plan, the next step will be the establishment of a [[business]] school to be linked to the center.

Working closely with local and international organizations; the QRCE focuses on issues such as: [[capacity building]], [[Consultant|consulting]], [[counseling]] and developing the local "Entrepreneurial Personality &amp; Spirit".{{cn|date=July 2018}} Furthermore, the QRCE is actively working on extending the [[intellectual wealth]] of Jordan while maintaining strong links with the business community in general.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

{{Split|Property (philosophy)|Property (mathematics)|date=June 2018}}
In [[mathematics]], [[logic]], and [[philosophy]], a '''property''' is a characteristic of an [[Object (philosophy)|object]]; a red object is said to have the property of redness. The property may be considered a form of object in its own right, able to possess other properties. A property, however, differs from individual objects in that it may be [[instantiation principle|instantiated]], and often in more than one thing. It differs from the logical/mathematical concept of [[class (set theory)|class]] by not having any concept of [[extensionality]], and from the philosophical concept of [[class (philosophy)|class]] in that a property is considered to be distinct from the objects which possess it. Understanding how different individual entities (or particulars) can in some sense have some of the same properties is the basis of the [[problem of universals]]. The terms '''attribute''' and [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] have similar meanings.

==Metaphysical Debates about the Nature of Properties==
In modern [[analytic philosophy]] there are several debates about the fundamental nature of properties. These center around questions such as: Are properties real? Are they categorical or dispositional? Are properties physical or mental?
===Realism vs. Anti-Realism&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/#DisTer&lt;/ref&gt;=== 
A realist about properties asserts that properties have genuine existence. One way to spell this out is in terms of exact, repeatable, instantiations known [[universals]]. The other realist position asserts that properties are particulars(tropes), which are unique instantiations in individual objects that merely resemble one another to various degrees.

The anti-realist position, often referred to as [[nominalism]] claims that properties are names we attach to particulars. The properties themselves have no existence.

===Categoricalism vs. Dispositionalism&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/#CatProVsCauPow&lt;/ref&gt;=== 
According to the categoricalist, dispositions reduce to causal bases. The fragility of a wine glass, for example, is not a property that exists in the glass. Rather it can be explained by the categorical property of the glass's micro-structural composition.

Dispositionalism, in turn, asserts that a property is nothing more that a set of causal powers.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dispositions/#CatDisLawNat&lt;/ref&gt; Fragility, according to this view, identifies a real property of the glass (e.g. to shatter when dropped on a sufficiently hard surface).

Several intermediary positions exist.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dispositions/#CatDisLawNat&lt;/ref&gt; The Identity view that states that properties are both categorical(qualitative) and dispositional, they are just two ways of viewing the same property. One hybrid view claims that some properties are categorical and some are dispositional. A second hybrid view claims that properties have both a categorical(qualitative) and dispositional part, but that these are distinct ontological parts.

===Physicalism, Idealism, and Property dualism===
{{Main|Physicalism}}
{{Main|Idealism}}
{{Main|Property dualism}}
[[Image:Property dualism.jpg|thumb|Property dualism: the exemplification of two kinds of property by one kind of substance]] Property dualism describes a category of positions in the [[philosophy of mind]] which hold that, although the world is constituted of just one kind of [[substance theory|substance]]—the physical kind—there exist two distinct kinds of properties: [[physical properties]] and [[mental properties]]. In other words, it is the view that non-physical, mental properties (such as beliefs, desires and emotions) inhere in some physical substances (namely brains).

This stands in contrast to physicalism and idealism. Physicalism claims that all properties, include mental properties, ultimately reduce to, or supervene on, physical properties.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physicalism/&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphysical Idealism, by contrast, claims that "something mental (the mind, spirit, reason, will) is the ultimate foundation of all reality, or even exhaustive of reality."&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/idealism/#Int&lt;/ref&gt;

==Essential and accidental properties==
In classical [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] terminology, a ''property'' (Greek: ''idion'', Latin: ''proprium'') is one of the [[predicables]]. It is a non-[[essence|essential]] quality of a species (like an [[accident (philosophy)|accident]]), but a quality which is nevertheless characteristically present in members of that species. For example, "ability to laugh" may be considered a special characteristic of human beings. However, "laughter" is not an ''essential'' quality of the species ''human'', whose Aristotelian definition of "rational animal" does not require laughter. Therefore, in the classical framework, ''properties'' are characteristic qualities that are not truly required for the continued existence of an entity but are, nevertheless, possessed by the entity.

==Determinate and determinable properties==
A property may be classified as either determinate or determinable. A determinable property is one that can get more specific. For example, color is a determinable property because it can be restricted to redness, blueness, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinate-determinables/ Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy ''Determinate and Determinable Properties'']&lt;/ref&gt; A determinate property is one that cannot become more specific. This distinction may be useful in dealing with issues of [[identity (philosophy)|identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| pages = 31
| accessdate = 2008-01-28
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lovely and suspect qualities==
[[Daniel Dennett]] distinguishes between ''lovely'' properties (such as loveliness itself), which, although they
require an observer to be recognised, exist latently in perceivable objects; and ''suspect'' properties which have no existence at all until attributed by an observer (such as being suspected of a crime)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/lovely&amp;s.htm|title=Lovely and Suspect Qualities|publisher=|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties and predicates==
The ontological fact that something has a property is typically represented in language by applying a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] to a [[subject (grammar)|subject]]. However, taking any grammatical predicate whatsoever to be a property, or to have a corresponding property, leads to certain difficulties, such as [[Russell's paradox]] and the [[Grelling–Nelson paradox]]. Moreover, a real property can imply a host of true predicates: for instance, if X has the property of weighing more than 2 kilos, then the predicates "..weighs more than 1.9 kilos", "..weighs more than 1.8 kilos", etc., are all true of it. Other predicates, such as "is an individual", or "has some properties" are uninformative or vacuous. There is some resistance to regarding such so-called '''"[[Cambridge_change|Cambridge properties]]"''' as legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/existence/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Michael|last=Nelson|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2012|publisher=|accessdate=3 August 2016|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intrinsic and extrinsic properties==
{{main|Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)}}
An '''intrinsic''' property is a property that an object or a thing has of itself, independently of other things, including its context.  An '''extrinsic''' (or '''relational''') property is a property that depends on a thing's relationship with other things. The latter is sometimes also called an '''attribute''', since the value of that property is ''given'' to the object via its relation with another object. (See the [[etymology]] of the word on [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/attribute Wiktionary].) For example, [[mass]] is a physical intrinsic property of any [[Physical body|physical object]], whereas [[weight]] is an extrinsic property that varies depending on the strength of the gravitational field in which the [[respect]]ive object is placed. other examples are the ''name'' of a person (an attribute given by the person's parents) and the weight or mass of the person.

==Relations==
A relation is often considered{{by whom|date=March 2011}} to be a more general case of a property. Relations are true of several particulars, or shared amongst them. Thus the relation ".. is taller than .." holds "between" two individuals, who would occupy the two ellipses ('..'). Relations can be expressed by N-place predicates, where N is greater than 1.

It is widely accepted{{by whom|date=March 2011}} that there are at least some apparent relational properties which are merely derived from non-relational (or 1-place) properties. For instance "A is heavier than B" is a relational ''predicate'', but it is derived from the two non relational properties: the mass of A and the mass of B. Such relations are called external relations, as opposed to the more genuine internal relations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hume.ucdavis.edu/mattey/phi156/moore.pdf [[G. E. Moore|George Moore]], ''External and Internal Relations'']&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers believe that all relations are external, leading to a scepticism about relations in general, on the basis that external relations have no fundamental existence.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

'''Sebastian Salbert''' better known as '''Rahim''' (born November 17, 1978 in [[Katowice]]&lt;ref name="dlastudenta"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rahim (Sebastian Salbert) - Biografia, Życiorys - Muzyka|url=http://muzyka.dlastudenta.pl/artysta/Rahim/biografia,9213.html|website=muzyka.dlastudenta.pl|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Poles|Polish]] [[rapper]], [[hip hop production|producer]] and [[entrepreneur]]. He is the owner of [[record company]] MaxFloRec, the former member of groups such as 3xKlan, MZD, Erka and [[Paktofonika]]. Since 2003 He has been the one half of a duo [[Pokahontaz]] which he creates with [[Fokus (rapper)|Fokus]]. He has released several albums under his [[alter ego]] '''Straho'''.

In 2001 he, along with his then group [[Paktofonika]], received the Polish music award [[Fryderyk]] in ''Album of the year - hip-hop'' category for their album ''[[Kinematografia]]''. In 2011, magazine Machina classified him at number 25 on list of "30 best Polish rappers".

He has a younger brother, Minx, who is a [[beatbox]]er and won Polish championship in beatbox in 2007.

== Biography ==
Sebastian Salbert was born on November 17, 1978 in [[Katowice]]{{r|dlastudenta}}, where he spent his early childhood. He moved out to [[Mikołów]] with his family later where he lives to this day.&lt;ref name="maxflo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rahim - Wokaliści - Artyści - MaxFlo|url=http://maxflo.pl/Rahim.html|website=maxflo.pl|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began to be active as an artist in 1994 when he, along with Maczo, B.U.C and DJ Bambus, formed a group 3xKlan. In 1996, he produced two track for [[Kaliber 44]]'s debut album ''[[Księga Tajemnicza. Prolog]]'' and rapped on a track "Psychodela".&lt;ref name="ksiega"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kaliber 44 - Księga Tajemnicza. Prolog|url=https://www.discogs.com/Kaliber-44-Ksi%C4%99ga-Tajemnicza-Prolog/release/1379791|website=Discogs|accessdate=29 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, in 1997, 3xKlan released their debut and the only album ''Dom pełen drzwi'' which stylistically and lyrically was similar to Kaliber's debut. A few tracks from the album such as "Pozytywka" and "Łza wyobraźni" gained some popularity in Poland, peaking at Szczecińska Lista Przebojów chart. The album was also nominated for the [[Fryderyk]] award in category "Album of the year – rap &amp; hip-hop".&lt;ref name="3xklanfryderyk"&gt;{{cite web|last1=www.onyx.pl|first1=Onyx Sp. z o.o., tel. +48 572 400 000,|title=Nominowani i laureaci :: Nagroda muzyczna - Fryderyk :: Związek Producentów Audio-Video|url=http://www.zpav.pl/fryderyk/nominowani/index.php?year=1997|website=www.zpav.pl|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he was a part of short-lived projects eRKa and MZD.

In 1998, after the dissolution of 3xKlan, Rahim contacted with two rappers from Katowice: [[Magik (rapper)|Magik]] and [[Fokus (rapper)|Fokus]], and after a short period of time they created a new group [[Paktofonika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miszczak|first1=Radek|title=Radek Miszczak: Beaty, rymy, życie: leksykon muzyki hip-hop|date=2005|publisher=Kurpisz S.A.|isbn=9788389738752|page=381|edition=Wyd. 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2000, the group signed a contract with Gigant Records. On 18 December 2000, the debut album ''[[Kinematografia]]'' was released. Eight days after the release, Magik committed suicide by jumping out of the window. One year after the release of ''Kinematografia'', Rahim decided to co-produce the album ''Zawieszeni w czasie i przestrzeni'' of [[side-project]] [[Pijani Powietrzem]]. The album was finally released on 2002. On September 2002, Paktofonika's second and final studio album ''[[Archiwum kinematografii]]'', containing old Magik's verses, was released. Meanwhile, he was working on his studio album ''Experyment: PSYHO'' which eventually was released on November 17, 2002 under his [[alter ego]] name Straho.

In 2003, Paktofonika performed their last show at [[Spodek]] in [[Katowice]] and on the same day Rahim, along with Fokus and DJ Bambus, announced the start of the group [[Pokahontaz]]. In 2004 he founded his own [[record label]] MaxFloRec which is the continuation of MaxFloStudio which was opened in 1998.&lt;ref name="maxflohist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Info - O nas - MaxFlo|url=http://maxflo.pl/Info.html|website=maxflo.pl|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2005, the group released their first studio album ''Receptura''. The album was promoted with singles "Wstrząs dla mas", "Nie1", and "Cyfroni" and it debuted at number 3 on Polish [[OLiS]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oficjalna lista sprzedaży :: OLIS - Official Retail Sales Chart|url=http://olis.onyx.pl/listy/index.asp?idlisty=254&amp;lang=pl|website=olis.onyx.pl|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he produced the debut album ''Miraż'' for hip-hop group Projektor. 

On 2007, Rahim started collaborating with [[L.U.C]], an [[alternative hip hop]] and [[nu jazz]] artist, and on October 19, 2007 they released their joint album ''Homoxymoronomatura''. The album was promoted with singles "Hemoglobina" and "Nibyminipocieszne Psychomarionety". On November, the same year, Rahim released, as previously under his nickname Straho, his second studio album ''DynamoL''. The album features guest appearances from rappers like [[Abradab]], Grubson and the group Projektor.

A year later, he performed in a play "Szepty", directed by Jack Burban at [[Polish Theatre in Wrocław]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wywiad z Rahimem|url=http://iwiesz24.pl/wywiad-z-rahimem|accessdate=4 December 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926145515/http://iwiesz24.pl/wywiad-z-rahimem|archive-date=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he released ''Homoxymoronomatura Live'' - a [[live album|live version]] of ''Homoxymoronomatura''. In 2010, Rahim released his first debut studio album under his normal pseudonym. The album, titled ''Podróże po amplitudzie'', was finally released on March 5, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rah!m* - Podróże Po Amplitudzie|url=https://www.discogs.com/Rahm-Podr%C3%B3%C5%BCe-Po-Amplitudzie/release/2179683|website=Discogs|accessdate=11 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 6, 2010, a [[remix album]] of the album, titled ''Amplifikacja'' was released. The remixes were produced by producers such as: [[O.S.T.R]], DiNO, Vixen and others.

On 2012, Rahim, along with Fokus, were focused on working on ''[[Jesteś Bogiem]]'', a movie, directed by Leszek Dawid, which tells a story of [[Paktofonika]]. The movie was released on September 21, 2012 and received highly positive reviews. On October 19, [[Pokahontaz]] released their second studio album ''Rekontakt'' which debuted at number 2 on Polish [[OLiS]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=www.onyx.pl|first1=Onyx Sp. z o.o., tel. +48 22 3377222,|title=Oficjalna lista sprzedaży :: OLIS - Official Retail Sales Chart|url=http://olis.onyx.pl/listy/index.asp?idlisty=775&amp;lang=|website=olis.onyx.pl|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SANZAAR''' (South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina Rugby) is the body which operates [[Super Rugby]] and [[The Rugby Championship]] competitions in [[Rugby Union]]. SANZAAR meets annually and is composed of the CEOs from its member unions.

It was formed as SANZAR in 1996 as a joint venture of the [[South African Rugby Union]], the [[New Zealand Rugby Union]] and the [[Australian Rugby Union]]. From the 2016 season, its name was changed to SANZAAR following the inclusion of the [[Argentine Rugby Union]] as a full member of the organisation.&lt;ref name="SANZAR changes name to SANZAAR"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/sanzar-changes-name-to-sanzaar-20160202 | title=SANZAR changes name to SANZAAR | work=Sport24 | date=2 February 2016 | accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Tri-Nations and Super 12: 1996 ===
[[File:SANZAR logo old.svg|150px|thumb|left|{{nowrap|SANZAR logo up to 2015.}}]]

SANZAR was formed in 1995, shortly after rugby's move to professionalism, to counter the threat of Australia's [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]], a new [[rugby league]] competition that offered large salaries to players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howitt|first=Bob |year=2005| title=SANZAR Saga: Ten Years of Super 12 and Tri-Nations Rugby| publisher=Harper Collins Publishers |ISBN=1-86950-566-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SANZAR proposed the [[Super Rugby|Super 12]], an annual provincial competition with teams from all three countries, and the [[The Rugby Championship|Tri Nations Series]], an annual competition between each country's Test teams. This concept was developed by [[Queensland Rugby Union]] [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] Terry Doyle, [[New South Wales Rugby Union]] CEO [[David Moffett]] and [[Australian Rugby Union]] CEO Bruce Hayman.&lt;ref name = smh-2002/&gt; [[Rian Oberholzer]] was the first CEO of SANZAR.

SANZAR's proposals were under serious threat from the World Rugby Corporation (WRC), a company formed by lawyer Geoff Levy and former Wallaby player Ross Turnbull. Both wanted a professional worldwide rugby competition funded by [[Kerry Packer]], who had already developed professional cricket. At one point the WRC had a majority of the All Blacks and Wallaby teams signed up to their competition. However, the South African Rugby Union told the Springboks players that they would never play for their country again if they committed to the WRC, and they remained with the SARU. Most of the All Blacks then followed them, and finally the Wallabies did too.

To fund the competitions, SANZAR looked to [[News Limited]], who was the Super League's broadcaster, eventually being offered $555 million over 10 years for worldwide television rights.

=== Expansion to Super 14 ===

In 2002, a proposal to expand the Super 12 to fourteen teams, supported by Australia and South Africa, was vetoed by the [[New Zealand Rugby Union]].&lt;ref name = espn-19-02-2002/&gt; This led to calls for the Australian and South African teams to withdraw from the competition,&lt;ref name = espn-19-02-2002/&gt;&lt;ref name = espn-21-02-2002/&gt; but the partnership continued and the issue was revisited before the end of the original 10-year broadcasting deal.

For the 2006 season, SANZAR agreed to expand the Super 12 competition with two new teams and to increase the number of Test matches played in the Tri-Nations.&lt;ref name = espn-6-9-2004/&gt; Licences were granted for franchises based in Bloemfontein and Perth,&lt;ref name= cheetahs/&gt;&lt;ref name = espn-10-12-2004/&gt; creating the [[Cheetahs (rugby union)|Cheetahs]] and [[Western Force]] teams for the expanded Super 14 competition.

The SANZAR partnership was tested in 2007 after New Zealand removed its top 22 players from the Super 14 competition,&lt;ref name = smh-2007/&gt; and South Africa's removal of players from the Tri-Nations prompted calls for the [[Australian Rugby Union]] to cancel future matches against the Springboks.&lt;ref name = aus-2007/&gt;

==== Potential South African departure ====
In 2009 there emerged concerns that [[South African Rugby Union]] might opt to break away from the alliance over a dispute about the proposed plan to expand [[Super Rugby]] to fifteen teams in 2011, voicing its support for the concept generally but disagreeing over its length and format.  On 6 May 2009, however, ARU Chief Executive [[John O'Neill (sport administrator)|John O'Neill]] warned that the South Africans would be the real losers, missing out altogether and potentially losing players if they went ahead with the split. "The joint venture must remain intact", he urged. "I have dealt with the South Africans for years in [[business]] and [[sport]].  Part of their [[DNA]] is to take it to the brink.  There's a moment when they will realise they have taken it far enough."&lt;ref name= reuters-2009/&gt; On 20 May 2009, SANZAR announced it had reached agreement on a new deal involving all three nations beginning in the 2011 season.&lt;ref name= deal-2009/&gt;

=== The Rugby Championship and Super Rugby: 2011 ===
The deal for 2011 to 2015 included:&lt;ref name= deal-2009/&gt;
* Super Rugby expanded to 15 teams, and split into three conferences, each with five teams and based in one of the three nations. The four current Australian teams would be joined by a new team in the Australia conference; this license was later awarded to the [[Melbourne Rebels]].
* At the same time, the regular season expanded to include 16 matches (8 home, 8 away) per team, with each country playing a double round-robin within its home conference, and playing single matches against four teams from each of the other conferences.
* Super Rugby taking three weeks off in June for the mid-year Tests.
* The play-offs expanded to six teams, with the conference winners joined by the three non-winners with the most competition points without regard to conference affiliation. The two conference winners with the most competition points received a first-round bye in the play-offs.
* [[The Rugby Championship]] opening each year in South Africa, and concluding with the two of the three [[Bledisloe Cup]] matches between Australia and New Zealand that fall within the Rugby Championship. This allowed Springboks to be released early for their domestic competition, the [[Currie Cup]].

=== Super Rugby to Argentina and Japan: 2016 ===
Further expansion was agreed in 2015 to include the [[Argentine Rugby Union]] as a full member of SANZAAR from 2016.&lt;ref name = nyt-2015/&gt; Three additional teams were included in the Super Rugby competition, one each from South Africa, Argentina and Japan. Two regional groupings were formed: the Australasian Group, with five teams in the Australian Conference and five teams in the New Zealand Conference and the South African Group, with six South African teams, one Argentinean team and one Japanese team split into a four-team Africa 1 Conference a four-team Africa 2 Conference.&lt;ref name="Outline of the Super Rugby competition structure"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://files.allblacks.com/comms/new-era-super-rugby/Outline-%20Super-Rugby-Comp-Structure-infographic.pdf | title=Outline of the Super Rugby competition structure | publisher=All Blacks | date=1 May 2014 | accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a Japanese team has been invited to participate in the [[Super Rugby]] competition from 2016, Japan is not a member of SANZAAR at this stage.

[[File:suicidemessageggb01252006.JPG|thumb|300px|As a suicide prevention initiative, this sign on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] promotes a special telephone, available on the bridge itself, with which persons considering suicide can connect to a [[crisis hotline]].]]
'''Suicide prevention''' is an umbrella term used for the collective efforts of local citizen organizations, [[health professional]]s and related professionals to reduce the incidence of [[suicide]]. Beyond direct [[#Interventions|interventions]] to stop an impending suicide, methods also involve: 
*Treating the psychological and psychophysiological symptoms of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. 
*Improving the [[Coping (psychology)|coping strategies]] of persons who would otherwise seriously consider suicide. 
*Reducing the prevalence of conditions believed to constitute risk factors for suicide. 
*Giving people hope for a better life after current problems are resolved.

General efforts have included preventive and proactive measures within the realms of [[medicine]] and [[mental health]], as well as [[public health]] and other fields. Because protective factors such as [[social support]] and [[social engagement]] — as well as environmental risk factors such as access to lethal means — apparently play some significant roles in suicide prevention, suicide should not be viewed solely as neither a medical issue nor a mental health issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/suicide/about/riskprot.htm |title=Maine Suicide Prevention Website |publisher=Maine.gov |accessdate=2012-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=January 15, 2012 |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11613 |title=Suicide prevention definition - Medical Dictionary definitions of popular medical terms easily defined on MedTerms |publisher=Medterms.com |date=2003-09-16 |accessdate=2012-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide prevention is risky for [[health professional]]s in terms of practitioner emotional distress and risk for malpractice suits.&lt;ref&gt;Packman, Pennuto, Bongar, &amp; Orthwein, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk assessment==

===Warning signs===
Being aware of the warning signs of suicide can allow individuals to direct people who may be considering suicide to get help.&lt;ref name=NIH2017&gt;{{cite web|title=NIMH » Suicide Prevention|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/suicide-prevention/index.shtml#part_153177|website=www.nimh.nih.gov|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warning signs include:&lt;ref&gt;[[American Association of Suicidology]]&lt;/ref&gt;

# Suicidal ideation: thinking, talking, or writing about suicide, planning for suicide
# Substance abuse
# Purposelessness
# Anxiety, agitation and unable to sleep or not sleeping all the time
# Trapped
# Hopelessness
# Social withdrawal from friends, family, or society
# Anger, rage or seeking revenge
# Recklessness or impulsiveness
# Mood changes including depression

Additionally, the national institute for mental health includes feeling burdonsome, and strong feelings of pain--either emotional or physical--as warning signs that someone may intend attempt suicide.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

Some signs that someone may attempt suicide include:&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; 
#strong feelings of pain, either emotional or physical considering oneself burdensome 
#increased use of drugs or alcohol

===Screening===
The U.S. Surgeon General has suggested that screening to detect those at [[Assessment of suicide risk|risk of suicide]] may be one of the most effective means of preventing suicide in children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Surgeon General:The Surgeon General's Call To Action To Prevent Suicide 1999 [http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/calltoaction/calltoaction.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
There are various screening tools in the form of self-report [[questionnaire]]s to help identify those at risk such as the [[Beck Hopelessness Scale]] and [[Is Path Warm?]]. A number of these self-report questionnaires have been tested and found to be effective for use among adolescents and young adults.&lt;ref&gt;Rory C. O'Connor, Stephen Platt, Jacki Gordon: International Handbook of Suicide Prevention: Research, Policy and Practice, p. 510 [https://books.google.com/books?id=3fDGLWQtwFkC&amp;pg=PA510&amp;dq=suicide+screening&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fYl1TsewCqbh0QHfpbnjDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=suicide%20screening&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; There is however a high rate of false-positive identification and those deemed to be at risk should ideally have a follow-up clinical interview.&lt;ref&gt;Rory C. O'Connor, Stephen Platt, Jacki Gordon, International Handbook of Suicide Prevention: Research, Policy and Practice, p.361; Wiley-Blackwell (2011), {{ISBN|0-470-68384-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predictive quality of these screening  questionnaires has not been conclusively validated so it is not possible to determine if those identified at risk of suicide will actually commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Alan F. Schatzberg: The American Psychiatric Publishing textbook of mood disorders, p. 503: American Psychiatric Publishing; (2005)  {{ISBN|1-58562-151-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asking about or screening for suicide does not create or increase the risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crawford|first=MJ|author2=Thana, L |author3=Methuen, C |author4=Ghosh, P |author5=Stanley, SV |author6=Ross, J |author7=Gordon, F |author8=Blair, G |author9=Bajaj, P  |title=Impact of screening for risk of suicide: randomised controlled trial.|journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry|date=May 2011|volume=198|issue=5|pages=379–84|pmid=21525521|doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.110.083592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In approximately 75 percent of completed suicides, the individuals had seen a physician within the year before their death, including 45 to 66 percent within the prior month.  Approximately 33 to 41 percent of those who completed suicide had contact with mental health services in the prior year, including 20 percent within the prior month. These studies suggest an increased need for effective screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|805459|Depression and Suicide}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 20048221 | pmc = 2887749 | doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2009.168 | issue=1 | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry |date=January 2010 | title = Depression Care in the United States: Too Little for Too Few  | pages=37–46 | author=Gonz&amp;aacute;lez HM, Vega WA, Williams DR, Tarraf W, West BT, Neighbors HW | volume=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12042175 | volume=159 | issue=6 | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry |date=June 2002 | title = Contact with mental health and primary care providers before suicide: a review of the evidence.  | pages=909–16 |vauthors=Luoma JB, Martin CE, Pearson JL | doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.159.6.909| pmc=5072576 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18616858 | volume=53 | issue=6 | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |date=June 2008 | title = Contact of mental and nonmental health care providers prior to suicide in Taiwan: a population-based study.  | pages=377–83 |vauthors=Lee HC, Lin HC, Liu TC, Lin SY }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9926074 | volume=173 | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry |date=December 1998 | title = Suicide and recency of health care contacts.

===Underlying condition===
The conservative estimate is that 10% of individuals with psychiatric disorders may have an undiagnosed medical condition causing their symptoms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1978.01770350041003 |pmid=568461 |volume=35 |issue=11 |title=Physical illness presenting as psychiatric disease |date=November 1978 |journal=Arch.

==Interventions==
[[File:US Navy 091027-N-0000X-001 A photo illustration produced by the Defense Media Agency on suicide prevention.jpg|thumb|A photo illustration produced by the Defense Media Agency on suicide prevention]]
Many methods have been developed in an effort to prevent suicide. The general methods include: direct talks, screening for risks, lethal means reduction and social intervention. The medication [[lithium]] may be useful in certain situations to reduce the risk of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Randolph B. Schiffer, Stephen M. Rao, [[Barry S. Fogel]], Neuropsychiatry: Neuropsychiatry of suicide, pp. 706-713, (2003){{ISBN|0781726557}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.10.1805 |pmid=16199826 |volume=162 |issue=10 |title=Lithium in the prevention of suicidal behavior and all-cause mortality in patients with mood disorders: a systematic review of randomized trials |date=October 2005 |journal=Am J Psychiatry |pages=1805–19 |vauthors=Cipriani A, Pretty H, Hawton K, Geddes JR }}&lt;/ref&gt; Talk therapies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.63.7.757 |pmid=16818865 |volume=63 |issue=7 |title=Two-year randomized controlled trial and follow-up of dialectical behavior therapy vs therapy by experts for suicidal behaviors and borderline personality disorder |date=July 2006 |journal=Arch.

===Direct talks===
[[File:LifelineLogo-1-.jpg|thumb|[[National Suicide Prevention Lifeline]], a nationwide crisis line in the United States also available in Canada]]
An effective way to assess suicidal thoughts is to talk with the person directly, to ask about depression, and assess suicide plans as to how and when it might be attempted.&lt;ref name="WHOa"&gt;
   [http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/en/59.pdf "Preventing Suicide - A Resource for Primary Health Care Workers"] (PDF),  World Health Organization, Geneva, 2000, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular misconceptions, talking with people about suicide does not plant the idea in their heads.&lt;ref name=WHOa/&gt; However, such discussions and questions should be asked with care, concern and compassion.&lt;ref name=WHOa/&gt; The tactic is to reduce sadness and provide assurance that other people care. The WHO advises to not say everything will be all right nor make the problem seem trivial, nor give false assurances about serious issues.&lt;ref name=WHOa/&gt; The discussions should be gradual and specifically executed when the person is comfortable about discussing his or her feelings. ICARE (Identify the thought, Connect with it, Assess evidences for it, Restructure the thought in positive light, Express or provide room for expressing feelings from the restructured thought) is a model of approach used here.&lt;ref name=WHOa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George A.F. Seber|title=Counseling Issues: A Handbook For Counselors And Psychotherapists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F9aeYXZZTN8C&amp;pg=PA266|year=2013|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=978-1-4797-5740-4|pages=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lethal means reduction===
Means reduction, reducing the odds that a suicide attempter will use highly lethal means, is an important component of suicide prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/index.html |title=Means Matter Campaign |publisher=Hsph.harvard.edu |accessdate=2012-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is also called "means restriction".

Researchers and health policy planners have theorized and demonstrated that restricting lethal means can help reduce suicide rates, as delaying action until depression passes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sprc.org/featured_resources/trainingandevents/conferences/co/pdf/lethalmeans.pdf Suicide Prevention Resource Center - Lethal Means]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, strong evidence supports the effectiveness of means restriction in preventing suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yip|first1=PS|last2=Caine|first2=E|last3=Yousuf|first3=S|last4=Chang|first4=SS|last5=Wu|first5=KC|last6=Chen|first6=YY|title=Means restriction for suicide prevention.|journal=Lancet|date=23 June 2012|volume=379|issue=9834|pages=2393–9|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60521-2|pmid=22726520}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also strong evidence that restricted access at so-called suicide hotspots, such as bridges and cliffs, reduces suicides, whereas other interventions such as placing signs or increasing surveillance at these sites appears less effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cox, GR, Robinson, J, Nicholas, A|title= Interventions to reduce suicides at suicide hotspots: a systematic review.|journal=BMC Public Health |date=March 2013|volume= 13|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-13-214 |pmid=23496989 |pmc=3606606 |pages=214|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous historical examples, of means reduction, is that of [[coal gas]] in the United Kingdom. Until the 1950s, the most common means of suicide in the UK was poisoning by gas inhalation. In 1958, natural gas (virtually free of carbon monoxide) was introduced, and over the next decade, comprised over 50% of gas used. As carbon monoxide in gas decreased, suicides also decreased. The decrease was driven entirely by dramatic decreases in the number of suicides by carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/saves-lives/index.html |title=Means Matter Campaign - Coal Gas Case |publisher=Hsph.harvard.edu |accessdate=2012-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kreitman | first1 = N | date = Jun 1976 | title = The Coal Gas Story: United Kingdom suicide rates, 1960-1971 | url = | journal = Br J Prev Soc Med | volume = 30 | issue = 2| pages = 86–93 | pmid = 953381 | pmc=478945 | doi=10.1136/jech.30.2.86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, numerous studies have concluded that firearm access is associated with increased suicide completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/risk/index.html |title=Means Matter - Risk |publisher=Hsph.harvard.edu |accessdate=2012-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; "About 85% of attempts with a firearm are fatal: that's a much higher case fatality rate than for nearly every other method. Many of the most widely used suicide attempt methods have case fatality rates below 5%."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/risk/index.html#What%20is%20it |title=Firearm Access is a Risk Factor for Suicide - Means Matter Basics - Means Matter - Harvard School of Public Health |publisher=Hsph.harvard.edu |accessdate=2012-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5307a1.htm#tab7 |title=Cdc Mmwr |publisher=Cdc.gov |accessdate=2012-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although restrictions on access to firearms have reduced firearm suicide rates in other countries, such restrictions were not feasible in the United States because the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution]] based on late 1600s [[Bill of Rights 1689|English bill of rights]] limits the potential for regulation laws but broadly restricting firearms access to at-risk individuals is gaining stakeholder's attention as a preventive measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mann|first1=J. John|last2=Michel|first2=Christina A.|title=Prevention of Firearm Suicide in the United States: What Works and What Is Possible|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|date=22 July 2016|pages=appi.ajp.2016.1|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2016.16010069|volume=173|pmid=27444796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social intervention===
[[File:Niagara Falls Emergency Crisis Hotline.jpg|thumb|A telephone connected to a [[crisis hotline]] at [[Niagara Falls State Park]]]]
National Strategy for Suicide Prevention promotes and sponsors various specific suicide prevention endeavors:

* Developing groups led by professionally trained individuals for broad-based support for suicide prevention.
* Promoting community-based suicide prevention programs.
* Screening and reducing at-risk behavior through psychological resilience programs that promotes [[optimism]] and connectedness.
* Education about suicide, including [[Suicide#High-Risk Factors|risk factors]], warning signs, stigma related issues and the availability of [[Suicide#Treatment|help]] through social campaigns.
* Increasing the proficiency of health and welfare services at responding to people in need. e.g., Sponsored training for helping professionals, Increased access to community linkages, employing [[Crisis hotline|crisis counseling organizations]].
* Reducing [[domestic violence]] and [[Drug abuse|substance abuse]] through legal and empowerment means are long-term strategies.
* Reducing access to convenient [[Suicide methods|means of suicide]] and methods of self-harm. e.g., toxic substances, poisons, handguns.
* Reducing the quantity of dosages supplied in packages of non-prescription medicines e.g., aspirin.
* [[School Based Prevention Programs|School-based]] competency promoting and skill enhancing programs.
* Interventions and usage of ethical surveillance systems targeted at [[Suicide#Epidemiology|high-risk groups]].
* Improving reporting and portrayals of negative behavior, suicidal behavior, mental illness and substance abuse in the entertainment and news media.
* Research on protective factors &amp; development of effective clinical and professional practices.

It has also been suggested by NSSP that media should prevent romanticising of negative emotions and coping strategies which can lead to [[vicarious traumatization]]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (from a 1994 workshop) and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (1999) have suggested that TV shows and news media can help prevent suicide by linking suicide with negative outcomes such as pain for the suicide and their survivors, conveying that the majority of people choose something other than suicide in order to solve their problems, avoiding mentioning [[suicide epidemic]]s, and avoiding presenting authorities or sympathetic, ordinary people as spokespersons for the [[reasonableness of suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Preventive strategies on suicide|author=R. F. W. Diekstra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postvention===
Postvention is for people affected by an individual's suicide, this intervention facilitates grieving, guides to reduce guilt, anxiety, and depression and to decrease the effects of trauma. [[Bereavement]] is ruled out and promoted for [[catharsis]] and supporting their adaptive capacities before intervening depression and any psychiatric disorders. Postvention is also provided to intervene to minimize the risk of imitative or copycat suicides, but there is a lack of evidence based standard protocol. But the general goal of the mental health practitioner is to decrease the likelihood of others identifying with the suicidal behavior of the deceased as a coping strategy in dealing with adversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Summary of the Practice Parameters for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents With Suicidal Behavior|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=40|issue=4|year=2001|pages=495–499|issn=0890-8567|doi=10.1097/00004583-200104000-00024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medication===
Recent research has shown that [[Lithium (medication)|lithium]] has been effective with lowering the risk of suicide in those with bipolar disorder to the same levels as the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12720484 |volume=64 Suppl 5 |title=Lithium treatment and suicide risk in major affective disorders: update and new findings |year=2003 |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |pages=44–52 |vauthors=Baldessarini RJ, Tondo L, Hennen J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lithium has also proven effective in lowering the suicide risk in those with unipolar depression as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10826662 |volume=61 Suppl 9 |title=Lithium in unipolar depression and the prevention of suicide |year=2000 |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |pages=52–6 |author=Coppen A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counseling===
There are multiple evidence-based psychotherapeutic talk therapies available to reduce suicidal ideation such as [[dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT) for which multiple studies have reported varying degrees of clinical effectiveness in reducing suicidality. Benefits include a reduction in self-harm behaviours and suicidal ideations.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Agency for Drugs and technology in Health: "Dialectical Behaviour Therapy in Adolescents for Suicide Prevention: Systematic Review of Clinical-Effectiveness," ''CADTH Technology Overviews'', Volume 1, Issue 1, March 2010 [http://cadth.ca/en/products/cadth-overviews/vol-1-issue-1/vol-1-issue-1-04#c] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126001615/http://cadth.ca/en/products/cadth-overviews/vol-1-issue-1/vol-1-issue-1-04#c |date=2011-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Mental Health: Suicide in the U.S.: Statistics and Prevention [http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/suicide-in-the-us-statistics-and-prevention/index.shtml#DB-Therapy]&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CBT-SP) is a form of DBT adapted for adolescents at high risk for repeated suicide attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stanley B, Brown G, Brent DA, etal |title=Cognitive-behavioral therapy for suicide prevention (CBT-SP): treatment model, feasibility, and acceptability |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=48 |issue=10 |pages=1005–13 |date=October 2009 |pmid=19730273 |pmc=2888910 |doi=10.1097/CHI.0b013e3181b5dbfe |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0890-8567(09)60165-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/511760/Child-and-youth-suicide-workshop.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coping planning====
Coping planning is an innovative strengths-based intervention that aims to meet the needs of people who [[Help-seeking|ask for help]], including those experiencing suicidal ideation.&lt;ref name="Stallman 2018"&gt;.Stallman, H. M. (2018). Coping Planning: A patient- and strengths-focused approach to suicide prevention training. Australasian Psychiatry, 26(2):141-144. doi:https://doi.org/10.1177/1039856217732471&lt;/ref&gt; By addressing ''why'' someone asks for help, the risk assessment and management stays on what the person needs, and the [[needs assessment]] focuses on the individual needs of each person.&lt;ref&gt;Stallman, H. M. (2017). Meeting the needs of patients who have suicidal thoughts presenting to Emergency Departments.  Emergency Medicine Australasia, 29(6), 749. doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1742-6723.12867&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, JC, Ribeiro, JD, Fox, KR.

Psychol Bull 2016; 143: 187–232. doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/bul0000084&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Coping Planning]] approach to suicide prevention draws on the health-focused [[Coping (psychology)| theory of coping]]. Coping is normalized as a normal and universal human response to unpleasant emotions and interventions are considered a change continuum of low intensity (e.g. self-soothing) to high intensity support (e.g. professional help). By planning for coping, it [[Social support|supports]] people who are [[Distress (medicine)|distressed]] and provides a sense of [[belongingness]] and  [[Psychological resilience|resilience]] in treatment of illness.&lt;ref name="stallmanwilson"&gt;Stallman, H.

===Support groups===
Many non-profit organizations exist, such as the [[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]] in the United States, which serve as crisis hotlines; it has benefited from at least one [[Crowdsourcing|crowd-sourced]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/137409-GamerGate-Leads-to-Suicide-Prevention-Charity&lt;/ref&gt; The first documented program aimed at preventing suicide was initiated in 1906 in both New York, the National Save-A-Life League and in London, the Suicide Prevention Department of the Salvation Army.&lt;ref&gt;Bertolote, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Suicide prevention interventions fall into two broad categories: prevention targeted at the level of the individual and prevention targeted at the level of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bertolote |first1=Jose |date=October 2004 |title=Suicide Prevention: at what level does it work? |journal=World Psychiatry |volume=3 |issue=3|pages=147–151 |pmc=1414695 |pmid=16633479}}&lt;/ref&gt; To identify, review, and disseminate information about best practices to address specific objectives of the National Strategy Best Practices Registry (BPR) was initiated. The Best Practices Registry of Suicide Prevention Resource Center is a registry of various suicide intervention programs maintained by the American Association of Suicide Prevention. The programs are divided, with those in Section I listing [[Evidence-based practice|evidence-based]] programs: interventions which have been subjected to indepth review and for which evidence has demonstrated positive outcomes. Section III programs have been subjected to review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.sprc.org/bpr/section-i-evidence-based-programs Best Practices Registry (BPR) For Suicide Prevention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031022002/http://www2.sprc.org/bpr/section-i-evidence-based-programs |date=2011-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rodgers PL, Sudak HS, Silverman MM, Litts DA |title=Evidence-based practices project for suicide prevention |journal=Suicide Life Threat Behav |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=154–64 |date=April 2007|pmid=17521269 |doi=10.1521/suli.2007.37.2.154 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model of suicide==
Van Orden et al. (2010) posited that there are two major factors involved in suicide attempts. The first major factor is a ''desire for death'' and the second ''acquired capability''. Desire for death occurs through [[Intrusive thought|ideations]] of ''thwarted belongingness.'' It is described as feeling alienated from others emotionally and ''perceived burdensomeness'' which is described as feeling that one is incompetent and therefore a burden on others.&lt;ref&gt;Ribeiro &amp; Joiner, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The acquired capability in this context is used because people naturally fear death and painful experiences. The capability to carry out the suicide attempt is usually formed from emotional and physical pain and disrupted cognitive status and is acquired through previous suicide attempts (self-directed violence), rehearsing suicide through behavior or imagery, and getting used to painful or dangerous experiences in other ways.

Individuals who are suicidal often have tunnel vision about the situation and consider permanence of suicide as an easy way out of a difficult situation.&lt;ref&gt;Kraft, Jobes, Lineberry, Conrad, &amp; Kung, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Other significant risk factors for suicide include [[psychiatric disorder]]s, [[substance abuse]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Van Orden et al., 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3492539 | pmid=22996297 | doi=10.1007/s11920-012-0318-3 | volume=14 | title=Can we really prevent suicide? | year=2012 | journal=Curr Psychiatry Rep | pages=624–33 |vauthors=Schwartz-Lifshitz M, Zalsman G, Giner L, Oquendo MA }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who have good interpersonal social relationship and family support tend to have lower risk of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Rudd, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; People who have greater self-control, greater self-efficacy, intact reality-testing, and more adaptive coping skills are at less risk. Those who are hopeful, have future plans or events to look forward to, and have satisfaction in life are considered to have protective factors against suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, Pellmar, Kleinman, &amp; Bunney, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategies==
[[File:United States Army Suicide Prevention Poster.jpg|thumb|A United States Army suicide prevention poster]]
Suicide is the act of deliberately killing oneself or, more specifically, an act deliberately initiated and performed by the person concerned in the full knowledge, or expectation, of its fatal outcome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/topics/suicide/en/ WHO], 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of the need for comprehensive approaches to suicide prevention, various strategies have been developed with the support of evidence. The traditional approach has been to identify the risk factors that increase suicide or self-harm, though meta-analysis studies suggest that suicide risk assessment might not be useful and recommend immediate hospitalization of the person with suicidal feelings as the healthy choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Declan|last2=Devitt|first2=Patrick|title=Suicide Risk Assessment Doesn't Work|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/suicide-risk-assessment-doesnt-work/|website=Scientific American|accessdate=5 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], under the direction of the Surgeon General, published the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention, establishing a framework for suicide prevention in the U.S. The document calls for a public health approach to suicide prevention, focusing  on identifying patterns of suicide and [[suicidal ideation]] throughout a group or population (as opposed to exploring the history and health conditions that could lead to suicide in a single individual).&lt;ref name="sprc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sprc.org/library/nssp.pdf |title=National Strategy for Suicide Prevention |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to recognize warning signs of suicide allows individuals who may be concerned about someone they know to direct them to help.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

Suicide gesture and suicidal desire (a vague wish for death without any actual intent to kill oneself) are potentially self-injurious behaviors that a person may use to attain some other ends, like to seek help, punish others, or to receive attention. This behavior has the potential to aid an individual’s capability for suicide and can be considered as a suicide warning, when the person shows intent through verbal and behavioral signs.&lt;ref&gt;Joiner, 2005; Wingate et al., 2004; Rudd, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific strategies===
Suicide prevention strategies focus on reducing the risk factors and intervening strategically to reduce the level of risk. Risk and protective factors, unique to the individual can be assessed by a qualified mental health professional.

Some of the specific strategies used to address are:

* Crisis intervention.
* Structured counseling and psychotherapy.
* Hospitalization for those with low adherence to collaboration for help and those who require monitoring &amp; secondary symptom treatment.
* Supportive therapy like substance abuse treatment, Psychotropic medication, Family psychoeducation and Access to emergency phone call care with [[Emergency department|emergency rooms]], suicide prevention hotlines...etc.
* Restricting access to lethality of suicide means through policies and laws.
* Creating &amp; using [[Crisis plan#Mental health .27crisis cards.27|crisis cards]], an uncluttered card formatted readably that describes list of activities one should follow in crisis still the positive behavior responses settles in the personality.
* Person-centered life skills training. e.g., Problem solving.
* Registering with support groups like [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], Suicide Bereavement Support Group, a religious group with [[Flow (psychology)|flow]] rituals, etc.
* Therapeutic recreational therapy that improves mood.
* Motivating self-care activities like physical exercise's and meditative relaxation.

Psychotherapies that have shown most successful or evidence based are Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), it has shown to be helpful in reducing suicide attempts and reducing hospitalizations for suicidal ideation&lt;ref&gt;Linehan et al., 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and Cognitive therapy (CBT), it has shown to improve problem-solving and coping abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Stellrecht et al., 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preventative Factors=== 
Individuals with access to proper mental health care, a sense of belonging, good problem solving skills, and a system of beliefs that discourages suicide are less likely to attempt suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert I. Simon|title=Assessing and Managing Suicide Risk: Guidelines for Clinically Based Risk Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9ZsoxUJyW8C&amp;pg=PA76|date=20 May 2008|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub|isbn=978-1-58562-726-4|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
In the United States it is estimated that an episode of suicide results in costs of about $1.3 million. Money spending on appropriated interventions is estimated to result in a decrease in economic loses that are 2.5 fold greater than the amount spent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Costs of Suicide|url=https://www.sprc.org/about-suicide/costs/|website=www.sprc.org|accessdate=6 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4631">[[File:Sukhoi SSBJ project model.jpg|thumb|right|Sukhoi SSBJ project model]]
A '''supersonic business jet''' ('''SSBJ''') would be a small [[business jet]], intended to travel at speeds above [[Mach number|Mach 1.0]] ([[supersonic aircraft]]). No SSBJs are currently available, although several manufacturers are working on or have worked on designs.

Typically intended to transport about ten passengers, proposed SSBJs would be about the same size as traditional subsonic business jets.  Only two large commercial [[supersonic transport]]s ever entered service: the [[Concorde|Aérospatiale/British Aerospace Concorde]] and [[Tupolev Tu-144]].  They had relatively high costs, high noise, high fuel consumption and some environmental concerns.  Both were operated under large government subsidy and did not recoup development costs.

Several manufacturers believe that many of these concerns can be successfully addressed at a smaller scale. In addition, it is believed that small groups of high-value passengers (such as [[corporate officer|executive]]s or [[head of state|heads of state]]) will find value in higher speed transport.

Current and former proposals for SSBJs include:
* [[Aerion SBJ]]
* [[Aerion AS2]] 
* [[HyperMach SonicStar]]
* [[SAI Quiet Supersonic Transport]]
* [[Spike S-512]]
* [[Sukhoi-Gulfstream S-21]]
* [[Tupolev Tu-444]]

Several companies, including [[Gulfstream Aerospace]], continue to work on technologies intended to reduce or mitigate [[sonic booms]]. An example is the [[Quiet Spike]].

In January 2018, [[Vladimir Putin]] proposed a civil SSBJ variant of the [[Tu-160]] bomber, for a potential market of 20-30 units in Russia alone at $100-120 million each.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AIN30jan2018&gt;--&gt;
[[United Aircraft Corporation|UAC]] previously studied a SSBJ, displaying a scale model at [[MAKS Air Show]] 2017, to be designed and built in seven years with an existing engine like the [[NK-32]] and a titanium [[airframe]], a limited production would be worth an expected $150 million price.&lt;ref name=AIN30jan2018&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2018-01-30/russia-flirts-ssbj-version-tu-160-bomber |title= Russia Flirts with SSBJ Version of Tu-160 Bomber |author= Vladimir Karnozov |date= January 30, 2018 |work= AINonline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Solid Gold Cadillac''''' is a 1956 film directed by [[Richard Quine]] and written by [[Abe Burrows]], [[Howard Teichmann]] and [[George S. Kaufman]]. It was adapted from the hit [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play of the same name by Teichmann and Kaufman, in which they pillory [[big business]] and corrupt businessmen. The film stars [[Judy Holliday]] and [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]]. The film is in black-and-white except for the very last scene, which is in [[Technicolor]].

==Plot==
At a [[shareholder]]s meeting for International Projects, a billion dollar corporation, John T. Blessington ([[John Williams (actor)|John Williams]]) announces that he is replacing Edward L. McKeever ([[Paul Douglas]]), the company's founder, President and Chairman of the Board, who is resigning to work for the federal government in [[Washington D.C.]] Laura Partridge ([[Judy Holliday]]), a minority [[stockholder]] with just ten shares of stock, drives its arrogant, self-serving executives to distraction with her incessant questioning during this and subsequent meetings.

Blessington comes up with the idea of hiring the struggling actress as Director of Shareholder Relations to keep her occupied answering letters from small shareholders. He assigns her a secretary, Amelia Shotgraven ([[Neva Patterson]]), with secret instructions to obstruct her as much as possible. The conscientious Miss Partridge, discovering there is nothing for her to do, decides to write the stockholders herself. She gains Amelia's friendship and wholehearted assistance by helping her develop a romantic relationship with office manager Mark Jenkins ([[Arthur O'Connell]]).

When the directors find out, they fire Amelia. However, Laura discovers that Blessington's thoroughly unqualified brother-in-law, Harry Harkness ([[Hiram Sherman]]), has driven a competitor into bankruptcy, unaware that International Projects actually owns the unfortunate company. With that as leverage, she gets Amelia rehired.

Still determined to neutralize Laura, the Board decides to send her to Washington to persuade McKeever to give them some government contracts. She agrees to go, with the secret intention of trying to convince him to return and take back control from his crooked cronies. However, the company Directors recall that he has divested himself of all his shares and is thus powerless, so they brush him off.

McKeever takes them to court, arguing that Laura was an unlicensed, illegal lobbyist; but, when she is forced to admit on the stand that she had another, romantic, reason for seeing him, the case is dropped. However, Laura has forged a warm relationship with many of the smaller investors while working at the company; they responded and sent in their [[Proxy voting|proxies]], giving her the right to vote their shares. McKeever uses these votes to replace the entire Board. He marries Laura. As a gift to "The Girl Who Has Everything," her husband presents her a Solid Gold Cadillac for her birthday.

==Reception==
[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised Holliday highly, stating, "the invincible Miss Holliday has dared to project her youthful figure and personality into the character shaped by Miss Hull" ([[Josephine Hull]], then in her seventies, played the role in the Broadway play) and is "knocking the role completely dead."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |title=The Solid Gold Cadillac (1956) |author=Bosley Crowther |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 25, 1956 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=2&amp;res=9E0DE1DE1138E033A05756C2A9669D946792D6CF&amp;partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he felt that the villains of the piece were neither particularly convincing ("not precisely representatives of the workaday financial world"), original ("cut from a fairly familiar stencil of Kaufmanesque farce"), or formidable enough ("The problems set up by the play-wrights are little barriers of cardboard farce").&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; He concluded, "it will give you an entertaining ride, but don't expect it to take you or your intelligence very far."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The [[Film4]] reviewer agreed that the story was not particularly convincing ("Yeah – like global capitalism gets overthrown that easily"), but "even so, it's undemanding and amusing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.film4.com/reviews/1956/solid-gold-cadillac-the |title=Solid Gold Cadillac, The |accessdate=March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Versatilist''' is someone who can be a specialist for a particular discipline, while at the same time be able to change to another role with the same ease.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

The term "versatilist" was first coined in an article from [[Gartner]], where it states that "Versatilists are able to apply a depth of skill to a progressively widening scope of situations and experiences, equally at ease with technical issues as with business strategy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/492218 Gartner Says Technical Aptitude No Longer Enough To Secure Future for IT Professionals, ''Gartner Press Release'', 9 November 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is to the advantage of an organization to employ versatilists—because an enterprise will be able to easily redeploy this type of employee based on changes in business requirements or strategy.

To illustrate this using a mathematical concept, the versitilist has a higher [[area under the curve]] rating.  Think of a person having some level of knowledge/experience in 15 knowledge areas.  That person may have a very high competency (score 5) in 3 areas, a medium level of competency (score 3) in 5 areas an introductory level of competency (score 1) in 4 areas and no competency (score 0) in 3 areas.  This creates an area under the curve of 34.  This is different from a specialist who may score very high in 1 area and have no competency in others.  This is also different from a generalist who may score a 1 or 3 in every area.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

This breadth of knowledge and experience is what enables faster changes to other roles.{{cn|date=June 2016}}
