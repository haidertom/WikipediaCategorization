The producers chose to stay as true to the book which inspired the film as possible:&lt;ref name="Christian Today 2"/&gt;{{blockquote|{{sic}}"I think a lot of people read books, especially true stories, and then the movie is not even close to the real story and they make up things.

[[File:A Frank Statement.png|thumb|''A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers'']]
'''''A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers'''''&amp;nbsp;was a historic first [[Tobacco advertising|advertisement]] in a campaign&amp;nbsp;run by major American&amp;nbsp;[[tobacco]]&amp;nbsp;[[Tobacco industry|companies]]&amp;nbsp;on January 4, 1954, to create doubt by disputing recent scientific studies linking smoking&amp;nbsp;[[cigarettes]]&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;[[lung cancer]] and other dangerous&amp;nbsp;[[Health effects of tobacco|health effects]].&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tobacco.org/Documents/dd/ddfrankstatement.html|title=Daily Doc: The "Frank Statement" of 1954|last=|first=|date=2017-11-07|website=www.tobacco.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaching an estimated 43 million people through more than 400 newspapers throughout the United States, ''A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers'' and subsequent advertisements were designed by public relations firm [[Hill &amp; Knowlton]] to [[Social engineering (political science)|socially engineer]] the public's perceptions of tobacco and to instill doubt about scientific research linking disease and smoking.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/900540359|title=Up in smoke : from legislation to litigation in tobacco politics|last=Martha|first=Derthick|publisher=CQ Press|year=|isbn=1452202230|edition=Third|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=33–41|oclc=900540359}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of ''A Frank Statement'' and tobacco advertisements that still exist today, the tobacco industry continues to expand its markets by avoiding health concerns and portraying its products in a positive light.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236761/|title=TOBACCO ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION|last=Youths|first=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Preventing Nicotine Addiction in Children and|last2=Lynch|first2=Barbara S.|last3=Bonnie|first3=Richard J.|date=1994|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==

Reports of a link between tobacco and lung cancer emerged as early as 1912, but until the 1950s, the evidence was circumstantial since smoking was so pervasive in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thun|first=Michael J|date=2005|title=When truth is unwelcome : the first reports on smoking and lung cancer : Public Health Classics|url=http://www.who.int/iris/handle/10665/73130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, hoping to find the cause of the significant surge in lung cancer incidence in the US and England, [[Richard Doll|Dr. Richard Doll]] and [[Austin Bradford Hill|Professor Bradford Hill]] conducted a [[case-control study]] in which [[lung cancer]], other cancer, and non-cancer patients from twenty London-area hospitals were interviewed about their smoking habits. The study, published in the ''[[The BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'', found that the lung cancer patients were more likely to be heavier smokers than the other cancer and non-cancer control patients.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doll|first=Richard|last2=Hill|first2=A. Bradford|date=1950-09-30|title=Smoking and Carcinoma of the Lung|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=2|issue=4682|pages=739–748|issn=0007-1447|pmc=2038856|pmid=14772469|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4682.739}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results revealed to the medical community that a link between smoking and lung cancer may exist. Smoking was so prevalent that before these results were published, the increase in lung cancer incidence was attributed to the growing presence of automobiles, roads, and factories in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/ep/ep713_history/EP713_History8.html|title=Epidemiology of Chronic Diseases|last=LaMorte|first=Wayne W.|date=October 18, 2017|website=sphweb.bumc.bu.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wynder and Graham Figure 3.png|thumb|Wynder and Graham's study found that lung cancer patients were more likely to be heavier smokers than the other cancer and non-cancer control patients.]]
In 1950, [[Ernst Wynder|Dr. Ernst Wynder]] and [[Evarts Ambrose Graham]] published a study in the [[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]] in which they interviewed 684 people with proven cases of lung cancer about their smoking habits. The study found that heavy and sustained usage of tobacco, especially in the form of cigarettes, increased the likelihood of developing of lung cancer.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wynder|first=Ernest L.|last2=Graham|first2=Evarts A.|date=1985-05-24|title=Tobacco Smoking as a Possible Etiologic Factor in Bronchiogenic Carcinoma: A Study of Six Hundred and Eighty-Four Proved Cases|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/398680|journal=JAMA|volume=253|issue=20|pages=2986–2994|doi=10.1001/jama.1985.03350440064033|issn=0098-7484|pmc=2623809}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, to study the biological likelihood of cancer being linked to smoking, [[Ernst Wynder|Wynder]] published an animal study in the US journal ''[[Cancer Research (journal)|Cancer Research]]'' that found that tobacco tar was [[carcinogen]]ic when applied to the skin of mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/795182557|title=Drugs-- without the hot air : minimising the harms of legal and illegal drugs|last=Nutt|first=David|date=2012|publisher=UIT|year=|isbn=1906860165|location=Cambridge, England|pages=201–202|oclc=795182557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The&amp;nbsp;December 1952 issue of ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' featured an article, titled ''Cancer by the Carton,'' that discussed these recent studies on the link between smoking and lung cancer. The article presented to the public the studies' conclusion that tobacco causes lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/bcm92f00/pdf|title=Cancer by the Carton|last=Norr|first=Roy|date=December 1952|website=legacy.library.ucsf.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;As a result, the article provoked a health scare, which resulted in a small drop in consumption, and a fall in stock prices.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

In 1954, Doll and Hill published another article in the ''British Medical Journal'' releasing the results of the&amp;nbsp;[[British Doctors Study]],&lt;nowiki/&gt;which revealed a significant pattern of increased death from lung cancer as the amount of tobacco smoked increased.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doll|first=Richard|last2=Hill|first2=A. Bradford|date=1954-06-26|title=The Mortality of Doctors in Relation to Their Smoking Habits|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=4877|pages=1451–1455|issn=0007-1447|pmc=2085438|pmid=13160495|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.4877.1451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, which were the immediate post-war years and the beginning of the [[Atomic Age|nuclear age]], science was very highly regarded by the public, so the accumulating scientific evidence linking tobacco to lung cancer posed a major threat to the tobacco companies' public image.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Allan M.|date=January 2012|title=Inventing Conflicts of Interest: A History of Tobacco Industry Tactics|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=102|issue=1|pages=63–71|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2011.300292|issn=0090-0036|pmc=3490543|pmid=22095331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social engineering ==
With mounting evidence of a link between smoking tobacco and lung cancer, tobacco companies faced a dilemma of whether to admit to or deny the health risks of smoking. In order to preserve their industry, the tobacco companies opted to completely deny health risks. Instead, the tobacco companies crafted a strategy that, through creative advertising and marketing, would manipulate the cultural context surrounding their product from one that regarded the product unfavorably to one that held the product in high esteem. This strategy is known as [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]].&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

On December 15, 1953, led by Paul Hahn, the head of [[American Tobacco Company|American Tobacco]], the six major tobacco companies ([[American Tobacco Company|American Tobacco Co.]], [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|R. J. Reynolds]], [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]], [[Benson &amp; Hedges]], [[U.S. Tobacco Company|U.S. Tobacco Co.]], and Brown &amp; Williamson) met with public relations company [[Hill &amp; Knowlton]] in New York City to create an advertisement that would assuage the public's fears and create a false sense of security in order to regain the public's confidence in the tobacco industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-09-18/magazine/tm-40179_1_tobacco-industry|title=Tobacco's Pr Campaign :  The Cigarette Papers|last=Goodman|first=Michael J.|date=1994-09-18|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill and Knowlton's president, [[John W. Hill]], realized that simply denying the health risks would not be enough to convince the public. Instead, a more effective method would be to create a major scientific controversy in which the scientifically established link between smoking tobacco and lung cancer would appear not to be conclusively known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tobaccotactics.org/index.php?title=Hill_%26_Knowlton|title=Hill &amp; Knowlton|last=University of Bath|first=|date=October 17, 2012|website=www.TobaccoTactics.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tobacco companies fought against the emerging science by producing their own science, which suggested that existing science was incomplete and that the industry was not motivated by self-interest.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; With the creation of the [[Tobacco Institute|Tobacco Industry Research Committee]], headed by accomplished scientist [[C. C. Little|C.C. Little]], the tobacco companies manufactured doubt and turned scientific findings into a topic of debate. The recruitment of credentialed scientists like Little who were skeptics was a crucial aspect of the tobacco companies' social engineering plan to establish credibility against [[Tobacco control|anti-smoking reports]]. By amplifying the voices of a few skeptical scientists, the industry created an illusion that the larger scientific community had not reached a conclusive agreement on the link between smoking and cancer.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

Internal documents released through [[whistleblower]]s and [[Lawsuit|litigation]], such as the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]], reveal that while advertisements like ''A Frank Statement'' made tobacco companies appear to be responsible and concerned for the health of their consumers, in reality, they were deceiving the public into believing that smoking did not have health risks. The whole project was aimed at protecting the tobacco companies' images of glamour and all-American individualism at the cost of the public's health.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bates, Clive, and Andy Rowell. "[http://www.who.int/tobacco/media/en/TobaccoExplained.pdf Tobacco Explained]" (PDF). World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims==
''A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers'' claims:
# That medical research of recent years indicates many possible causes of lung cancer.
# That there is no agreement among the authorities regarding what the cause is.
# That there is no proof that cigarette smoking is one of the causes.
# That statistics purporting to link cigarette smoking with the disease could apply with equal force to any one of many other aspects of modern life. Indeed, the validity of the statistics themselves is questioned by numerous scientists.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;
The claims made in ''A Frank Statement'' were largely false as:
# Recent medical research had indicated that while lung cancer does have many possible causes, smoking is by far the leading cause in many different types of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM195204032461405|title=Some Practical Aspects of Cancer Prevention|last=Wynder|first=Ernest L.|date=April 3, 1952|website=The New England Journal of Medicine|language=EN|doi=10.1056/nejm195204032461405|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Most scientists, except for skeptics hired by the tobacco companies, agreed that cigarette smoking is linked to lung cancer incidence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Multiple studies have shown a clear link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
# The studies linking cigarette smoking to lung cancer controlled for the "many other aspects of modern life" to show that cigarette smoking is the main cause.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Many of the "numerous scientists" who questioned the validity of the statistics were under the payroll of the tobacco companies.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

==Promises==
The advertisement also made several promises on behalf of the tobacco industry which were later disputed by the scientific community. In ''A Frank Statement,'' the tobacco companies stated that they believed that their products were safe; however, in a 2002 assessment of the promises made by the advertisement, it was concluded that some tobacco industry scientists believed that there was a [[Causality|causal relationship]] between tobacco and cancer.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cummings|first=K. M.|last2=Morley|first2=C. P.|last3=Hyland|first3=A.|date=March 2002|title=Failed promises of the cigarette industry and its effect on consumer misperceptions about the health risks of smoking|journal=Tobacco Control|volume=11 Suppl 1|pages=I110–117|doi=10.1136/tc.11.suppl_1.i110|issn=0964-4563|pmc=1766060|pmid=11893821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research was undertaken to find a safer cigarette, but tobacco companies realized that they could not produce a safer cigarette because doing so would mean admitting that current cigarettes were not safe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thus, the industry responded to the growing public concern by marketing their cigarettes as having [[Cigarette filter|filters]], milder smoke, and lower tar and [[Nicotine dependence|nicotine]] content; however, they did not acknowledge a causal link with cancer until 1999.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

''A Frank Statement'' also pledged "aid and assistance to the research effort into all phases of tobacco use and health," and announced the establishment of the [[Tobacco Institute|Tobacco Industry Research Committee]] (TIRC) to work towards that goal.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Much of the TIRC funded research was not directly connected to smoking as it focused mainly on cancer basics, such as [[immunology]], [[genetics]], [[cell biology]], [[pharmacology]], and [[virology]], rather than cancer's connection to smoking.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Neither the TIRC nor its successor, the Council for Tobacco Research, ever acknowledged a proven link between smoking and serious and/or life-threatening illness. When research did find a link between smoking and cancer, however, the findings were rarely reported to the public.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Despite the irrelevance of much of the TIRC funded research to the health effects of smoking, the tobacco industry continued to publicize its funding of the TIRC to reassure the public.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In reality, the TIRC was created as a public relations measure for the purposes of discrediting independent science and portraying the tobacco companies as transparent and concerned for the well-being of their customers.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

Finally, the advertisement promised that the tobacco companies "always have and always will cooperate closely with those whose task it is to safeguard the public health."&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; According to Cummings, Morley, and Hyland, "there is abundant evidence that the tobacco industry went to great lengths to undermine tobacco control efforts of the public health community."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An example of this is a memo from the vice-president of the [[Tobacco Institute]] in which the industry's strategy was described as "creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it", and "advocating the public's right to smoke, without actually urging them to take up the practice."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By proclaiming that the health risks were not conclusively linked to smoking, the tobacco companies manipulated the situation to place all liability on the consumer rather than on themselves.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

== Impact on the public ==
Although the tobacco industry claims that their advertising is only used to convince current smokers to switch between brands and that it does not increase total cigarette consumption, research into the effects of advertising shows that it plays an essential role in projecting positive connotations of smoking cigarettes onto potential new smokers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From 1954, when Hill &amp; Knowlton first started working with the tobacco industry, to 1961, the number of cigarettes sold annually rose from  369 billion to 488 billion, and the annual per capita consumption rose from 3344 to 4025 cigarettes.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

The [[Tobacco advertising|first cigarette advertisements]] claimed that smoking cigarettes had a variety of health benefits, such as prolonged youth, thinness, and attractiveness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, as more research revealed the deceptiveness of these claims, tobacco companies began to use advertisements, like ''A Frank Statement,'' to deny that their products caused cancer. Claiming that advertisement bans would infringe on "commercial [[Freedom of speech|free speech]]," the tobacco industry has continually fought against them; however, the industry has never responded to criticism that much of its advertising, like the claims made in ''A Frank Statement,'' is deceptive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, the tobacco industry's manipulation of science as a public relations tactic is still used today in debates on a wide variety of subjects including [[global warming]], [[Genetically modified organism|food]], and [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownell|first=Kelly D.|last2=Warner|first2=Kenneth E.|date=March 2009|title=The perils of ignoring history: Big Tobacco played dirty and millions died. How similar is Big Food?|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume=87|issue=1|pages=259–294|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2009.00555.x|issn=1468-0009|pmc=2879177|pmid=19298423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern-day examples ==
Today, tobacco companies continue to aggressively advertise cigarettes. As cigarette consumption has declined in the United States, tobacco companies have greatly increased their advertising expenditure. In 1991, the industry spent $4.6 billion on advertising and promoting cigarette consumption,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; and in 2015, tobacco companies spent $8.9 billion on advertising just in the United States.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/tobacco_industry/marketing/index.htm|title=CDC - Fact Sheet - Tobacco Industry Marketing - Smoking &amp; Tobacco Use|last=Health|first=CDC's Office on Smoking and|date=2017-11-16|website=Smoking and Tobacco Use|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco companies continue to use this money to fund social engineering techniques, such as campaigns featuring themes of social desirability and specific cultural references, to target women, children, and specific racial/ethnic communities.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For example, to make cigarettes appealing to African American communities, the industry has implemented campaigns that use urban culture and language while sponsoring Chinese and Vietnamese New Year festivals to target Asian Americans.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

With declining levels of smoking in the West due to [[List of smoking bans|smoking bans]] and increased education on the health risks of smoking, tobacco companies have also expanded their market into [[Developing country|developing countries]] to fulfill the industry's ever-present need for new smokers and more money. Using many of the same advertising techniques of glamour, sex, and independence, the industry has begun to target women and children in Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa, where government bans and health education may not be as prevalent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1997 [[Delia Gaze]] remarked that this work was sold for 2100 francs to the MET and its pendant (now lost) was sold for 2050 francs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=6_0Y0PALzQMC&amp;pg=PA652 Haverman's MET painting] in [[Delia Gaze]]'s ''[[Dictionary of Women Artists]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Blodgett must be credited with investing in the art of a woman, even if he let the pendant get away. Later curators must also be credited with keeping it, as only half of the 174 paintings are still in the collection.

==Description and interpretation==
The work shows blooms of [[rosa × centifolia]], [[dianthus]], [[alcea rosea]], [[calendula officinalis]], [[passiflora]], [[primula]], [[papaver somniferum|poppy]], [[tulipa|tulip]], [[myosotis|forget-me-nots]], the fruits [[peach]] and [[grape]], and various insects such as a [[Vanessa atalanta|Red Admiral]], [[fly]], [[ant]]s, and a [[snail]].&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;
The vase itself is an object showing a baroque relief.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;

The painting follows in a tradition of Dutch and Flemish flower still life paintings showing flowers in a vase with insects. This was popular among Dutch women painters of Haverman's time whose works she would have been familiar with, as evidenced by the forged signature of [[Rachel Ruysch]] on a painting by [[Ottmar Elliger]] in the popular ''flowers in a vase on a ledge with insects'' style. This painting had been in the famous collection of [[Josephus Augustinus Brentano]] and was later purchased by [[Adriaan van der Hoop]] as by Ruysch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collectie.amsterdammuseum.nl/amonline/advanced/Details/collect/38642 Stilleven met bloemen, 1673], [[Amsterdam Museum]] catalog&lt;/ref&gt; The painting illustrates the model the women worked from, as well as the relative value of Ruysch's work over that of Elliger later in the 18th-century. Haverman was registered as a pupil of the flower painter [[Jan van Huysum]], who was known for guarding his secrets and keeping his painting knowledge in the family. This work shows the influence of Van Huysum in its "niche" setting.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Comparable works by Haverman's compatriots were:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Possible followers of her technique were [[Francina Margaretha van Huysum]] and [[Cornelia van der Mijn]], whose green coloring appears to have faded to blue in the same way as the paintings of Backer and Haverman. This fading is possibly due to the use of a faded [[Stil de grain yellow|yellow lake pigment]].&lt;ref name=Liedtke/&gt;

'''Alfred Barye "Le Fils"''' or '''Alf Barye''' (Paris, [[France]], 21 January 1839 – Paris, [[France]], 1882) was a [[France|French]] sculptor, of the [[Belle Époque]], pupil of his father the artist [[Antoine-Louis Barye]]. In cooperation with [[Émile-Coriolan Guillemin]], Barye did the artwork for ''"The Arab Warrior Knight on Horseback"''. Included in Barye's [[Work of art|oeuvre]] were [[animalier]] bronzes as well as [[Orientalism|Oriental]] subjects. At his father's request, he signed his work as "fils" to differentiate his work from his father's.&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt;

==Early life==
Alfred Barye was born in Paris, France, on 21 January 1839,&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt; the son of Antoine-Louis Barye. He learned his craft of animalier sculptor under the watchful eye of his father who was one of the original pioneers of animal sculpture in the mid-to-late 19th century. The younger Barye didn't always get along with his father; there were times when the two of them were not on speaking terms because until instructed not to do so, Barye was signing some of his bronzes as "A. Barye" which the senior Barye objected to because it created confusion as to which Barye, father or son, created the sculpture.&lt;ref name="Bronze Gallery"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bronze Gallery – Alfred Barye|url=http://bronze-gallery.com/sculptors/artist.cfm?sculptorID=3|website=bronze-gallery.com|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Alfred Barye bronze bird.JPG|thumb|right|210px|A [[Plating|silvered]] bronze sculpture of a [[pheasant]] by Barye ({{circa|1875}})]]
He specialized in the animalier school in the production of [[bronze sculptures]]. Although a fine artist in his own right, he struggled to create his own identity living in the shadow of his more famous father. The vast majority of his pieces are signed "A. Barye, fils" while some are marked "Barye" or "A. Barye" which created some confusion – intentional or not – with those of his father.&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt; The majority of the sculptures leaving the Barye foundry were [[sand casting]]s&lt;ref name="Bronze Gallery" /&gt; rather than [[Lost-wax casting|lost-wax]] castings. Alfred typically used mid-brown [[patina]]s but would sometimes add green&lt;ref name="Green and Auburn patina"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfred Barye, French -- Rhinoceros (Lot 139)|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2013/european-sculpture-works-of-art-l13231/lot.139.html|website=Sothebys.com|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a color famously used by his father) and auburn-colored hues in the patination process.&lt;ref name="Green and Auburn patina" /&gt; Any Barye bronze – by father or son – will generally have an exquisite patina. Antoine-Louis was particularly finicky with his patinas and would not allow other foundries to apply them, preferring to do it himself for appearance and quality control purposes.&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt; Alfred, too, would not let a sculpture leave his workshop without a perfectly applied and visually pleasing patina.

Alfred Barye did a production of bronze sculptures and focused his attention on [[race horses]] or horses on the move. Some of his well-known bronzes are ''The Arab Warrior Knight on Horseback'' (1890–1910, made in Paris, height 87&amp;nbsp;cm, width 61&amp;nbsp;cm, depth 30&amp;nbsp;cm, bronze).

==Death and legacy==
Barye died in Paris in 1882. He is known for the precision detail in his bronze sculptures, as shown in the [[pheasant]] sculpture (''pictured right'').&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt; Barye was known for great attention to detail on his bronzes. He produced a number of [[bird]] sculptures as well as [[Genre art|genre figures]].&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt; He received "honourable mention" honors in the [[Salon (Paris)|1897 Salon]] for the work ''Aide Fauconnier Indien, Retour de Chasse à la Gazelle''. Alfred Barye's final submission at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] de [[Louvre]] was in 1882.&lt;ref name="Kjellberg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kjellberg|first1=Pierre|title=Bronzes of the 19th Century|date=1994|publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd.|location=Atglen, Pennsylvania|isbn=0-88740-629-7|pages=53|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The scenes in ''An Embarrassment of Riches'' is set during the mid-1990s, and occurs in a fictional island west of the Philippines, known as the Victorianas.  Victorianas is a "shadow of the Philippines" because it is a developing nation that has similarities to the Philippines.   Although filled with characters, circumstances, and places that are familiar to Filipino readers, the Victorianas and the novel deviated from the real and contemporary life in the Philippines, and from the actual events in Philippine history.  According to literary critic Vicente G. Groyon III, Ong’s fictionalization of recent Philippine history and recasting of the Philippines threads along the borders of [[surrealism]], providing the reader a sense of alienation, foreigness, or being ''not'' in the Philippines, despite of the similarity of the fictional Victorianas to the archipelago.  Among the differences between Victorianas and the Philippines is that the Victorianas is an [[Americanize]]d Asian country where there is the absence or, even if present, has reduced influences from Spain and Europe, in terms of the Catholic religion, folk beliefs, and traditional practices.  Victorianas is composed of [[mestizo]] or "hybrid" residents – including the descendants of Chinese, Japanese, Indian, and Malay ancestors, particularly the Chinese Filipinos.  Ong intended ''An Embarrassment of Riches'' as a novel that presents a Southeast Asian perspective, rather than a Hispanic or Latin American viewpoint.&lt;ref name=Pahl/&gt; ''An Embarrassment of Riches'' is a political, [[thriller (genre)|thriller-filled]] [[whodunit]],&lt;ref name=Geo/&gt; and satirical work of fiction that serves as a parody to the events occurring in the Philippines, through the author’s creation and utilization of the imaginary island named Victorianas.&lt;ref name=Pahl/&gt;

==Characters==
The main characters in ''An Embarrassment of Riches'' include Jeffrey Kennedy Tantivo, Jennifer Suarez (also known as JaySy or Jennifer Sy&lt;ref name=Geo/&gt;), General Azurin, Brother Mike Verano, and Alfonso Ong. Jeffrey Kennedy Tantivo is the hero and narrator in ''An Embarrassment of Riches''.  Jennifer Suarez Sy, the "daughter of the richest man" in Victorianas,&lt;ref name=Geo/&gt; is a female politician who wanted to rule Victorianas by providing everything to her constituents.  General Azurin is the dictator and ruler of Victorianas. Brother Mike Verano is a religious preacher with questionable background, the suspected killer of Tantivo's father.&lt;ref name=Pahl/&gt;&lt;ref name=Geo/&gt;  Alfonso Ong is another shady character, a wealthy and corrupt resident of Victorianas.&lt;ref name=Pahl/&gt;

==Plot==

In 1994,&lt;ref name=Geo/&gt; Jeffrey Kennedy Tantivo - a writer&lt;ref name=Geo/&gt; - returns from his exile in the Philippines&lt;ref name=Panitikan&gt;{{cite web|title=From 'An Embarrassment of Riches' by Charlson L. Ong, Part One |url=http://www.panitikan.com.ph/fiction/embarrassment-riches |publisher=Panitikan.com |accessdate=4 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928112837/http://www.panitikan.com.ph/fiction/embarrassment-riches |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to his homeland the Victorianas because of his father's death.  Ong intends to uncover the identities of his father's murderers.&lt;ref name=Geo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.ws/centennialnovels/article.pdf|title=A Hundred Years after the Noli: The Three Centennial Novels in English|first=R. Kwan|last=Laurel|publisher=Geocities|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to this circumstance, Tantivo was also summoned to return to Victorianas by his old friend Jennifer "JaySy" Suarez Sy. Sy – a middle aged woman belonging to the 20- to 30-year-old generation - wants Tantivo to manage her presidential campaign, timed after the demise of General Azurin, the dictatorial leader of Victorianas.  Sy is a politician with Maoist inclinations.  Sy won but her political rule was brief.  On one hand, Brother Mike Verano (originally named as Damian Echevaria), a charismatic preacher and healer, leads the Victorianas Moral Restoration Army using violence for the cause of morality.  Then, Alfonso Ong – a wealthy, shrewd and shady character – builds his alternative city of the future on an island off the coast of Victorianas.  The novel ends with Tantivo leaving Victorianas – going back in exile – but with a renewed sense and sagacity after the altercations and travails he experienced in the island nation.&lt;ref name=Pahl/&gt;  During Tantivo's stay in the Victoriana's, he found out that Jennifer Suarez is his half sister, and that his real father is Alfonso Ong.  Tantivo left the Victorianas with Jennifer Suarez, leaving their beloved nation in political, socio-economic, and religious turmoil.&lt;ref name=Geo/&gt;

==Analysis==
In ''An Embarrassment of Riches'', Ong employed [[metafiction]] to portray the Victorianas, a fictional country.  Metafiction uses techniques to draw attention to itself as a work of art, while exposing the "truth" of a story.  In the case of Ong, he used metafiction in ''An Embarrassment of Riches'' in order to draw attention to the novel as a work of literature and as a work of fiction, while exposing the realities happening in a non-fictional country - in this case the Philippines – represented by the Victorianas, an island monickered as a "little Philippines".&lt;ref name=Cleto/&gt;  According to literary critic R. Kwan Laurel, Ong’s An Embarrassment of Riches is the most successful in inventing a fictional Philippines among the three 1989 Philippine Centennial Literary Prize winners (the other winning novels were [[Alfred Yuson]]'s ''[[Voyeurs &amp; Savages]]'' and ''[[Eric Gamalinda|Eric Gamalinda's]]'' ''[[My Sad Republic]]'').  Ong created an alternate country – one smaller than an archipelago, and with a different name – to represent the Philippines and its social, economic, and political situation and atmosphere.  Because Ong is of [[Filipino Chinese|Chinese descent]], there was a possibility that the reader of ''''An Embarrassment of Riches'' can be interpreted as an "allegory of the Chinese gaining power – control and supremacy – in the Philippines".&lt;ref name=Geo/&gt;

The strength of ''An Embarrassment of Riches'' as a novel is that it did not "essentialize", simplify, and "exoticize" the Philippines (even if represented as the "Victorianas", the nation of the "Victorianos") and the Filipino experience. R. Kwan Laurel described the ending of ''An Embarrassment of Riches'' being similar to Filipino writer [[Nick Joaquin]]'s play the ''[[Portrait of an Artist as Filipino]]'', because Ong's hero pledges to survive, live, remember, and await for another opportunity, for the sake of all the people in the past.&lt;ref name=Geo/&gt;

'''András Szántó''' (b. Jan. 1, 1964, Budapest)  is a writer, researcher, and consultant in the fields of art, media, cultural policy, arts sponsorship, and philanthropy, based in New York.

==Life and work==

After a childhood and early youth spent in Budapest and London, Szántó attended the Budapest University of Economics (now [[Corvinus University]]), and, in 1988, moved to New York for graduate studies in sociology. At [[Columbia University]], as a [http://pfl-css.columbia.edu/programs/lazarsfeld-fellowship-program.html Lazarsfeld Fellow], his research interests turned to the social and commercial ramifications of the visual arts. He completed his Ph.D. dissertation in 1996 on New York art galleries and the transformation of the art world in the 1980s, working closely with [[Arthur Danto]], the Columbia philosopher and art critic.

While in graduate school, Szántó worked as a research analyst at the Media Studies Center at Columbia. In the years 1997-2005, he was deputy directory and director of the [http://www.najp.org/%20 National Arts Journalism Program] at [http://www.journalism.columbia.edu Columbia ‘s Graduate School of Journalism], in association with the [http://arts.columbia.edu School of the Arts]. In 2005-10 he directed, also at Columbia, the NEA Arts Journalism Institute in Classical Music and Opera. Other appointments have included: research affiliate of the Center for Arts and Cultural Policy Studies at [[Princeton University]], visiting critic at the [[American Academy in Rome]], and senior visiting fellow at the [http://www.artsusa.org/information_services/research/cultural_policy_listserv/default.asp%20in%20Washington,%20DC Center for Arts and Culture in Washington, DC].

[[File:compotier avec fruits, violon et verre.jpg|thumb|250px|''Composition with Fruit, Guitar and Glass'', 1912, [[Pablo Picasso]]]]
'''Appropriation''' in art is the use of pre-existing objects or images with little or no transformation applied to them.&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian &amp; Glaves-Smith, John eds., Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art, Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2009. pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; The use of appropriation has played a significant role in the [[history of the arts]] ([[literature|literary]], [[visual arts|visual]], [[music]]al and performing arts). In the visual arts, to appropriate means to properly adopt, borrow, recycle or sample aspects (or the entire form) of human-made visual culture. Notable in this respect are the [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp]].

Inherent in our understanding of appropriation is the concept that the new work '''recontextualizes''' whatever it borrows to create the new work. In most cases the original 'thing' remains accessible as the original, without change.

==Definition==
Appropriation has been defined as "the taking over, into a work of art, of a real object or even an existing work of art."&lt;ref name="Tate Terms"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Wilson |first1=Simon |last2=Lack |first2=Jessica |title=The Tate Guide to Modern Art Terms |url= |place=London |publisher=[[Tate Publishing Ltd]] |pages=20–21 |year=2008|isbn=978-1-85437-750-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tate Gallery]] traces the practise back to [[Cubism]] and [[Dadaism]], but continuing into 1940s [[Surrealism]] and 1950s [[Pop art]]. It returned to prominence in the 1980s with the [[Neo-minimalism|Neo-Geo]] artists.&lt;ref name="Tate Terms" /&gt;

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2013}}
In the early twentieth century [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]] appropriated objects from a non-art context into their work.  In 1912, Picasso pasted a piece of oil cloth onto the canvas. Subsequent compositions, such as  ''Guitar, Newspaper, Glass and Bottle'' (1913) in which Picasso used newspaper clippings to create forms, became categorized as ''synthetic [[cubism]]''.  The two artists incorporated aspects of the "real world" into their canvases, opening up discussion of signification and [[representation (arts)|artistic representation]].

[[Marcel Duchamp]] is credited with introducing the concept of the '''ready-made''', in which "industrially produced utilitarian objects...achieve the status of art merely through the process of selection and presentation."&lt;ref&gt;Elger, D. (2006). Dadaism. Koln: Taschen, pp. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Duchamp explored this notion as early as 1913 when he mounted a stool with a bicycle wheel and again in 1915 when he purchased a snow shovel and humorously inscribed it  “in advance of the broken arm, Marcel Duchamp.”&lt;ref&gt;Evans, D (ed.).(2009). ''Appropriation: Documents of contemporary art''. London and Cambridge: Whitechapel Gallery and the MIT Press, pp. 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne, P., and Snowdon, P. (1997). Duchamp &amp; Co. Paris: Terrail, pp. 105&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1917, Duchamp formally submitted a [[readymade]] into the [[Society of Independent Artists]] exhibition under the pseudonym, R. Mutt.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne, P., and Snowdon, P. (1997). Duchamp &amp; Co. Paris: Terrail, pp. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Entitled ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', it consisted of a porcelain urinal that was propped atop a pedestal and signed "R. Mutt 1917".  The work posed a direct challenge to traditional perceptions of fine art, ownership, originality and plagiarism, and was subsequently rejected by the exhibition committee.&lt;ref name="Plant, S. 1992 pp.44"&gt;Plant, S. (1992). [https://monoskop.org/images/2/24/Plant_Sadie_The_Most_Radical_Gesture_The_Situationist_International_in_a_Postmodern_Age.pdf The most radical gesture: The Situationist International in a postmodern age]. London and New York: Routledge, pp.44&lt;/ref&gt;  Duchamp publicly defended ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', claiming "whether Mr.Mutt with his own hands made the fountain or not has no importance.  He CHOSE it.  He took an ordinary article of life, placed it so that its useful significance disappeared under the new title and point of view—and created a new thought for that object."&lt;ref name="Plant, S. 1992 pp.44"/&gt;

The [[Dada]] movement (including Duchamp as an associate) continued with the appropriation of everyday objects. Dada works featured deliberate irrationality and the rejection of the prevailing standards of art. [[Kurt Schwitters]], who produced art at the same time as the Dadaists, shows a similar sense of the bizarre in his "merz" works. He constructed these from found objects,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} and they took the form of large constructions that later generations would call [[installation art|installation]]s.

The [[Surrealism|Surrealists]], coming after the Dada movement, also incorporated the use of '[[found objects]]' such as [[Méret Oppenheim]]'s ''Object (Luncheon in Fur)'' (1936).  These objects took on new meaning when combined with other unlikely and unsettling objects.

In 1938 Joseph Cornell produced what might be considered the first work of film appropriation{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} in his randomly cut and reconstructed film ''Rose Hobart''.

In the 1950s [[Robert Rauschenberg]] used what he dubbed "combines", literally combining readymade objects such as tires or beds, painting, [[Screen-printing|silk-screens]], collage, and photography.  Similarly, [[Jasper Johns]], working at the same time as Rauschenberg, incorporated found objects into his work.

The [[Fluxus]] art movement also utilised appropriation:{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} its members blended different artistic disciplines including visual art, music, and literature. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s they staged "action" events and produced sculptural works featuring unconventional materials.

Along with artists such as [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Andy Warhol]] appropriated images{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} from commercial art and popular culture as well as the techniques of these industries. Often called "[[pop art]]ists", they saw mass popular culture as the main vernacular culture, shared by all irrespective of education. These artists fully engaged with the ephemera produced from this mass-produced culture, embracing expendability and distancing themselves from the evidence of an artist's hand.

In 1958 Bruce Conner produced the influential ''A Movie'' in which he recombined existing film clips.  In 1958 Raphael Montanez Ortiz produced ''Cowboy and Indian Film'', a seminal appropriation film work.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In the late 1970s [[Dara Birnbaum]] was working with appropriation to produce [[feminist art|feminist works of art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Welchman|first1=John|title=Art After Appropriation: Essays on Art in the 1990s|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-80136-5|pages=33, 190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udVhfuujhF0C&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=%22dara%20birnbaum%22%20appropriation&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1978-79 she produced one of the first video appropriations. ''[[Technology/Transformation: Wonder Woman]]'' utilised video clips from the ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'' television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meigh-Andrews|first1=Chris|title=A History of Video Art|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-0-85785-188-8|page=194|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QQq5AQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=%22dara%20birnbaum%22%20technology%20transformation&amp;pg=PA194#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''''appropriation art''''' was in common  use in the 1980s with artists such as [[Sherrie Levine]], who addressed the act of appropriating itself as a theme in art.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}  Levine often quotes entire works in her own work, for example photographing photographs of [[Walker Evans]]. Challenging ideas of originality, drawing attention to relations between [[power (sociology)|power]], [[gender]] and [[creativity]], [[consumerism]] and commodity value, the social sources and uses of art, Levine plays with the theme of "almost same". [[Elaine Sturtevant]] (also known simply as Sturtevant), on the other hand, painted and exhibited perfect replicas of famous works. She replicated Andy Warhol's ''Flowers'' in 1965 at the Bianchini Gallery in New York. She trained to reproduce the artist's own technique—to the extent that when Warhol was repeatedly questioned on his technique, he once answered "I don't know. Ask Elaine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hans Ulrich Obrist|title=Elaine Sturtevant obituary|work=The Guardian|date=19 May 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/may/19/elaine-sturtevant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s [[Richard Prince]] re-photographed advertisements such as for [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro cigarette]]s or [[photo journalism|photo-journalism]] shots.  His work takes anonymous and ubiquitous cigarette billboard advertising campaigns, elevates the status and focusses our gaze on the images.

Appropriation artists comment on all aspects of culture and society. [[Joseph Kosuth]] appropriated images to engage with [[philosophy]] and [[epistemology|epistemological theory]]. Other artists working with appropriation during this time with included [[Jeff Koons]], [[Barbara Kruger]], [[Greg Colson]], and [[Malcolm Morley]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In the 1990s artists continued to produce appropriation art, using it as a medium to address theories and social issues, rather than focussing on the works themselves. [[Damian Loeb]] used film and cinema to comment on themes of [[simulacrum]] and reality. Other high-profile artists working at this time included [[Christian Marclay]], [[Deborah Kass]], [[Damien Hirst]]{{dubious|date=October 2013}} and [[Genco Gulan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://visualartbeat.com/self-portrait-by-genco-gulan/ | work=Visual Art Beat | first=Marcus | last=Graf | title=Self Portrait? by Genco Gülan | date=October 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the digital age ==
Since the 1990s, the exploitation of historical precursors is as multifarious as the concept of appropriation is unclear. A hitherto unparalleled quantity of appropriations pervades not only the field of the visual arts, but of all cultural areas. The new generation of appropriators considers themselves "archeolog[es] of the present time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Paolo Bianchi, quoted by Hedinger J.; Meyer, T.|title=Introduction to Whats next|url=http://whtsnxt.net/000|date=2011|publisher=Kadmos|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some speak of "postproduction", which is based on pre-existing works, to re-edit "the screenplay of culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bourriaud|first1=Nicolas|title=Postproduction. Culture as screenplay.

Appropriations have today become an everyday phenomenon.

The new "generation remix"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Djordjevic, V. |editor2=Dobusch, L. |title=Generation Remix|date=2014|publisher=iRights Media|url=http://irights-media.de/webbooks/generationremix/}}&lt;/ref&gt;—who have taken the stages not only of the visual arts, but also of music, literature, dance and film—causes, of course, highly controversial debates. Media scholars [[Lawrence Lessig]] coined in the begin of the 2000s here the term of the [[remix culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2009/05/download-lessigs-remix-then-remix-it/ Download Lessig's Remix, Then Remix It] on [[wired.com]] (May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand are the celebrators who foresee a new age of innovative, useful, and entertaining ways for art of the digitized and globalized 21st century.

More critical observers see this as the starting point of a huge problem. If creation is based on nothing more than carefree processes of finding, copying, recombining and manipulating pre-existing media, concepts, forms, names, etc. of any source, the understanding of art will shift in their sight to a trivialized, low-demanding, and regressive activity. In view of the limitation of art to references to pre-existing concepts and forms, they foresee endless recompiled and repurposed products. Skeptics call this a culture of recycling with an addiction to the past&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=cf.

Unlimited access to the digital archive of creations and easily feasible digital technologies, as well as the priority of fresh ideas and creative processes over a perfect masterpiece leads to a hyperactive hustle and bustle around the past instead of launching new expeditions into unexplored territory that could give visibility to the forgotten ghosts and ignored phantoms of our common myths and ideologies.

== Appropriation art and copyright ==
Appropriation art has resulted in contentious [[copyright]] issues regarding its validity under copyright law.  The U.S. has been particularly litigious in this respect. A number of [[case law|case-law]] examples have emerged that investigate the division between transformative works and [[derivative work]]s.

[[Andy Warhol]] faced a series of lawsuits from photographers whose work he appropriated and [[Screen-printing|silk-screened]]. Patricia Caulfield, one such photographer, had taken a picture of flowers for a photography demonstration for a photography magazine. Without her permission, Warhol covered the walls of [[Leo Castelli]]'s New York gallery with his silk-screened reproductions of Caulfield's photograph in 1964. After seeing a poster of Warhol's unauthorized reproductions in a bookstore, Caulfield sued Warhol for violating her rights as the copyright owner, and Warhol made a cash settlement out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy_warhol_flowers.html|title=Andy Warhol's Flower Paintings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Warhol's famous ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' are generally held to be non-infringing of the soup maker's [[trademark]], despite being clearly appropriated, because "the public was unlikely to see the painting as sponsored by the soup company or representing a competing product. Paintings and soup cans are not in themselves competing products", according to expert trademark lawyer [[Jerome Gilson]].&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;as quoted in Grant,Daniel, ''The Business of Being an Artist'' (New York: Allworth Press, 1996), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeff Koons]] has also confronted issues of copyright due to his appropriation work (see ''[[Rogers v. Koons]]''). Photographer Art Rogers brought suit against Koons for [[copyright infringement]] in 1989.  Koons' work, ''String of Puppies'' sculpturally reproduced Rogers' black-and-white photograph that had appeared on an airport greeting card that Koons had bought. Though he claimed [[fair use]] and [[parody]] in his defense, Koons lost the case, partially due to the tremendous success he had as an artist and the manner in which he was portrayed in the media.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}  The parody argument also failed, as the appeals court drew a distinction between creating a parody of modern society in general and a parody directed at a specific work, finding parody of a specific work, especially of a very obscure one, too weak to justify the fair use of the original.

In October 2006, Koons successfully defended a different work by claiming "[[fair use]]". For a seven-painting commission for the Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin, Koons drew on part of a photograph taken by [[Andrea Blanch]] titled ''Silk Sandals by Gucci'' and published in the August 2000 issue of ''Allure'' magazine to illustrate an article on metallic makeup. Koons took the image of the legs and diamond sandals from that photo (omitting other background details) and used it in his painting ''Niagara'', which also includes three other pairs of women's legs dangling surreally over a landscape of pies and cakes.

In his decision, [[Judge Louis L. Stanton]] of U.S. District Court found that ''Niagara'' was indeed a "transformative use" of Blanch's photograph. "The painting's use does not 'supersede' or duplicate the objective of the original", the judge wrote, "but uses it as raw material in a novel way to create new information, new aesthetics and new insights. Such use, whether successful or not artistically, is transformative."

The detail of Blanch's photograph used by Koons is only marginally copyrightable. Blanch has no rights to the Gucci sandals, "perhaps the most striking element of the photograph", the judge wrote. And without the sandals, only a representation of a woman's legs remains—and this was seen as  "not sufficiently original to deserve much copyright protection."
 
In 2000, [[Damien Hirst]]'s sculpture ''Hymn'' (which [[Charles Saatchi]] had bought for a reported £1m) was exhibited in ''Ant Noises'' in the Saatchi Gallery. Hirst was sued for breach of copyright over this sculpture. The subject was a 'Young Scientist Anatomy Set' belonging to his son Connor, 10,000 of which are sold a year by Hull (Emms) Toy Manufacturer.  Hirst  created a 20-foot, six-ton enlargement of the Science Set figure, radically changing the perception of the object. Hirst paid an undisclosed sum to two charities, [[Children Nationwide]] and the [[Toy Trust]] in an out-of-court settlement. The charitable donation was less than Emms had hoped for. Hirst sold three more copies of his sculpture for similar amounts to the first.

Appropriating a familiar object to make an art work can prevent the artist claiming copyright ownership. [[Jeff Koons]] threatened to sue a gallery under copyright, claiming that the gallery infringed his proprietary rights by selling bookends in the shape of balloon dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/02/04/DDRN1HIDPL.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Sam | last=Whiting | title=Jeff Koons' balloon-dog claim ends with a whimper | date=February 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koons abandoned that claim after the gallery filed a complaint for declaratory relief stating, "As virtually any clown can attest, no one owns the idea of making a balloon dog, and the shape created by twisting a balloon into a dog-like form is part of the public domain."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/36786/6-hilarious-zingers-from-the-balloon-dog-freedom-suit-filed-against-jeff-koons |title=6 Hilarious Zingers From the Balloon-Dog Freedom Suit Filed Against Jeff Koons |date= January 21, 2011 |website=BlouinArtinfo |last=ALLEN |first=EMMA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, photojournalist Patrick Cariou sued artist [[Richard Prince]], [[Gagosian Gallery]] and [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli books]] for copyright infringement. Prince had appropriated 40 of Cariou's photos of [[Rastafari]] from a book, creating a series of paintings known as ''Canal Zone''. Prince variously altered the photos, painting objects, oversized hands, naked women and male torsos over the photographs, subsequently selling over $10 million worth of the works. In March 2011, a judge ruled in favor of Cariou, but Prince and Gargosian appealed on a number of points.  Three judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the right to an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, Rachel; [http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/news/corbett/prince-wins-right-to-appeal-in-cariou-v-prince.asp "A Win for Richard Prince in Copyright Case"], ''Artnet Magazine'', 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Prince's attorney argued that "Appropriation art is a well-recognized modern and postmodern art form that has challenged the way people think about art, challenged the way people think about objects, images, sounds, culture"&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, Barbara, [http://www.artnews.com/2012/03/22/copy-rights/ "Copy Rights"], ARTnews LLC, March 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 24, 2013, the appeals court largely overturned the original decision, deciding that many of the paintings had sufficiently transformed the original images and were therefore a permitted use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/arts/design/appeals-court-ruling-favors-richard-prince-in-copyright-case.html?ref=arts&amp;_r=0|title=Court Rules in Artist's Favor|author=RANDY KENNEDY|date=April 25, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See '''[[Cariou v.

Retrieved on January 27, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kembrew McLeod]], author of several books on sampling and appropriation, said in [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] that Scott Blake's art should fall under the doctrine of [[fair use]].&lt;ref&gt;Dayal, Geeta.

Retrieved on January 27, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit questioned the Second Circuit's interpretation of the fair use doctrine in the ''Cariou'' case. Of particular note, the Seventh Circuit noted that "transformative use" is not one of the four enumerated fair use factors but is, rather, simply part of the first fair use factor which looks to the "purpose and character" of the use. The Seventh Circuit's critique lends credence to the argument that there is a split among U.S. courts as to what role "transformativeness" is to play in any fair use inquiry.&lt;ref name="proskauer.com"/&gt;

In 2013, Andrew Gilden and Timothy Greene published a law review article in The ''University of Chicago Law Review'' dissecting the factual similarities and legal differences between the ''Cariou'' case and the ''[http://www.ipinbrief.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/salinger-opinion.pdf Salinger v. Colting]'' case, articulating concerns that judges may be creating a fair use "privilege largely reserved for the rich and famous."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fair Use for the Rich and Fabulous? {{!}} The University of Chicago Law Review {{!}} The University of Chicago|url = https://lawreview.uchicago.edu/page/fair-use-rich-and-fabulous|website = lawreview.uchicago.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Merge to|Cryptolect|discuss=Talk:Cant (language)#Merge to Cryptolect|date=September 2017}} 
An '''argot''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|ɑr|ɡ|oʊ}}; from [[French language|French]] ''argot'' {{IPAc-fr|a|r|ˈ|ɡ|o}} '[[slang]]') is a [[Cant (language)|secret language]] used by various groups—e.g., schoolmates, outlaws, colleagues, gay people ([[Polari]]) among many others—to prevent outsiders from understanding their conversations. The term ''argot'' is also used to refer to the informal specialized vocabulary from a particular field of study, occupation, or hobby, in which [[word sense|sense]] it overlaps with [[jargon]]. The discipline of medicine has been referred to as having its own argot which includes abbreviations, acronyms, and "technical colloquialisms".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hukill|first=Peter B.|last2=H.|first2=A. L.|last3=Jackson|first3=James L.|date=1961|title=The Spoken Language of Medicine: Argot, Slang, Cant|jstor=453853|journal=American Speech|volume=36|issue=2|pages=145–151|doi=10.2307/453853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Victor Hugo]] was one of the first to research and compile terms from criminal argot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/hist255/popcorn/convicts2.html | title=Interesting Facts about Convicts of France in the 19th Century | author=Schwartz, Robert M. |publisher=Mt. Holyoke University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1862 novel ''[[Les Misérables]],'' he refers to that argot as both "the language of the dark" and "the language of misery."

The earliest known record of the term ''argot'' in this context was in a 1628 document. The word was probably derived from the contemporary name ''les argotiers'', given to a group of thieves at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Guiraud, Pierre, ''L'Argot. Que sais-je?'', Paris: PUF, 1958, p. 700&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the strictest definition, an ''argot'' is a proper language with its own grammar and style. But such complete secret languages are rare because the speakers usually have some public language in common, on which the argot is largely based. Such argots are mainly versions of another language, with a part of its vocabulary replaced by words unknown to the larger public; ''argot'' used in this [[word sense|sense]] is [[synonym]]ous with ''[[cant (language)|cant]]''. For example, ''argot'' in this sense is used for systems such as ''[[verlan]]'' and ''[[louchébem]]'', which retain French syntax and apply transformations only to individual words (and often only to a certain subset of words, such as nouns, or semantic content words).&lt;ref name="valdman"&gt;{{cite journal

Specific words can go from argot into common speech or the other way. For example, modern [[French language|French]] ''[[wikt:loufoque|loufoque]]'' 'crazy, goofy', now common usage, originates in the ''[[louchébem]]'' transformation of Fr. ''[[wikt:fou|fou]]'' 'crazy'.

"Piaf" is a Parisian argot word for "bird, [[sparrow]]". It was taken up by singer [[Edith Piaf]] as her stage name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/06/25/french-blues| title=French Blues| author=Judith Thurman| date=June 25, 2007| accessdate=May 5, 2015| publisher=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Association of Nail Technicians (ANT) was set up in March 1998 due to the demand that from nail technicians that an association was needed to advise and represent the UK’s growing number of nail technicians. A voice was needed to represent the nail industry on serious issues with local councils and licensing but also a point of contact on everyday problems.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20080919230413/http://www.professionalbeauty.co.uk/page.cfm/link%3D132/GoSection%3D9&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association of Nail Technicians was the first organisation to offer an insurance scheme with a policy designed specifically for nail technicians.

'''B Street Theatre''' is a [[501(c) organization|501c3 non-profit]] theater located in [[Sacramento]], California. It was founded by actor [[Timothy Busfield]] in 1986 as Theatre for Children, Inc., the company’s first focus was a touring theatre company for children.&lt;ref&gt;http://23blast.com/1/timothy-busfield/&lt;/ref&gt;  The B Street Theatre School Tour (formerly known as Fantasy Theatre) was and continues to be extremely popular in the community— performing 12 times per week, 38 weeks a year. The School Tour has received critical acclaim by the media and educators.  It is estimated that 3.6 million California children (currently about 200,000 per year) have attend performances since B Street Theatre's inception. For many children, The B Street Theatre School Tour is their only exposure to the live theatre in Northern California.

In 1991, in an effort to broaden the success of B Street Theatre School Tour, Timothy Busfield and his brother Buck Busfield created B Street Theatre. Most of the plays produced each year are world, national, West Coast or regional premieres. B Street Theatre has been named Best Live Theatre (14 consecutive years) by The Sacramento News &amp; Review and Best Performing Arts Organization 13 times by Sacramento Magazine; B Street Theatre performs to approximately 70,000 adults annually.

In 2002, the company embarked on a third endeavor to allow families to experience live, professional theatre together. The B Street Theatre Family Series produces a four-show season of professional theatre presenting plays for school field trips during the week and the general public on weekends. Curriculum materials are developed for each Family Series production, and teachers are encouraged to develop classroom lessons based on themes from each play.

In addition to a professional touring theatre, B Street School Tour holds an annual playwriting festival and contest.&lt;ref&gt;http://fox40.com/2015/11/17/b-street-theatre-youth-writers-workshops/&lt;/ref&gt; The festival was created to provide a forum for the dramatic voice of youth and to conduct playwriting workshops that assist children in developing literary skills, problem- solving techniques, and a mode of artistic expression. This process stimulates the intellect and enhances self-esteem by providing validation of creative ideas and work support

== Programs ==

'''''B Street Theatre School Tour''''' For more than 20 years the mission of the B Street School Tour has been to provide entertainment to children while encouraging in them a love for the theatre and a specific appreciation for the art of playwriting. In addition to a professional touring theatre, B Street School Tour offers playwriting workshops and a playwriting contest for children in public and private schools, hospitals, and other locations throughout Northern California.
An average of 450 children attend each performance, (with 12 performances a week, 37 weeks a year more than 200,000 children experience live theatre each year). A concerted outreach effort is made to ensure that the rich experience of theatre is provided to underserved communities. Children experience a variety of theatrical styles as well as a wide range of thematic ideas, from social commentary and family drama to satire and farce.

The playwriting contest was created to provide a forum for the dramatic voice of youth and playwriting workshops assist children in developing literary skills, problem-solving techniques, and increased artistic expression. This process stimulates the intellect and enhances self-esteem by providing validation of creative ideas and work efforts.

'''''B Street Theatre Mainstage''''' The B Street Theatre has been recognized as one of northern California’s top professional theatres. Seven new plays are presented each season to approximately 75,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;https://bstreettheatre.org/b-street-theatre-2/about-b-street/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''B Street Theatre Family Series''''' The Family Series primarily serves children and their families through performances in the company’s “B2” 112-seat theater space. The Family Series is California’s only full-time, professional resident theater for children. Eight of The Family Series’ 12 weekly performances are designated for school field trips. The remaining four weekly performances are for the public. Four new plays are presented each season to approximately 25,000 school children and families.

'''''B3 Series''''' The newest series of the B Street Theatre has a more serious and dramatic focus and features new contemporary plays for the sophisticated theatregoer. The B3 Series opened with a Pulitzer Prize winning drama on September 25, 2007 and presents four to five new plays each season. The B3 Series currently operates in the B2 space at alternate times than the scheduled Family Series productions.

'''''B Street Conservatory and Studio for Young Actors''''' The B Street Conservatory provides classes in technique and scene study to adult actors discovering their unique talents. The Studio for Young Actors is a year-round theatre education program to foster creativity, confidence and team building for young people ages 7 to 17. Instructors are B Street company members who themselves have received rigorous training and have extensive regional and national acting credits.

'''''Intern Company''''' The B Street Theatre Acting Internship is an intensive 10-month program that immerses young actors in every aspect of professional theatre. Interns are recent college graduates seeking their first post-college, professional theatre experience. The Intern Company experience provides four to eight talented young people with their first real “break” in the world of professional performing arts. In exchange for training and professional performing experience, interns provide the company with much needed assistance in the areas of administration as well as back and front of house operations.

[[File:Ground Floor Schematic.jpg|thumb|Ground Floor B Street]]

After getting a land grant from [[Sutter Medical Center]], B Street Theatre started a Capital Campaign to build a new theater.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2014/10/31/b-street-theatre-seeks-2-5m-grant-for-new-venues.html&lt;/ref&gt; The new theater is located at 27th and Capitol Avenue. The new Mainstage Theatre (Thrust Style) seats 250 patrons, and the Sutter Children’s Theatre (Proscenium Style) seats 365 - three times the past theatre's size, allowing the theater to bring art education to an additional 30,000 children the theatre presently cannot accommodate. The local economic impact is estimated to be at $40 million locally over first 5 years. Local architect, Ron Vrilakas, designed a "come as you are" theatre experience that resonates with the past theatre. Sutter Children’s Hospital is across the street in order to deepen the relationship between B Street and Sutter and further explore the restorative powers of theatre art for patients and their families. 

The new performing arts complex in midtown Sacramento, named in honor of one of its key supporters – The Sofia Tsakopoulos Center for the Arts, affectionately known as The Sofia - opened in February 2018. The Sofia is home to B Street Theatre’s Mainstage (naming opportunity still available) and the Sutter Theatre for Children – California’s first year-round, professional theatre for children. In the same spirit of community from which B Street Theatre was born, Sutter Theatre has opened its doors to host the performances and events of local artists, community organizations, and visiting acts. In effect, this landmark facility will become an entertainment hub for all of Sacramento, where locals and tourists alike can see theatre, comedy, dance, or musical acts in an intimate, professional space every night of the year. In addition, its large public lobby, classrooms, open-air courtyard, and on-site restaurant make The Sofia a true destination.

'''''Balder Dead''''' is a [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]] with powerful [[Tragedy|tragic themes]], first published in 1855 by [[Matthew Arnold]]. This poem draws upon [[Norse mythology]]: retelling the story of the murder of [[Odin]]'s son, [[Balder]], as brought about by the wicked machinations of [[Loki]], blood brother to Odin.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Matthew. Poetic Works. London: Oxford University Press, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The evil Loki was quickly punished for murdering Balder by being exiled from [[Asgard]]. Still, it remains for the gods - the [[Æsir]] and the [[Vanir]] dwelling in Asgard - to bury and to mourn their dead.

Partly out of desperate grief - and partly in defiance of the harshness of the [[Norns]] or fates: Odin begs [[Hermóðr|Hermod]] to ride his own steed, [[Sleipnir]], down to Hell and beg [[Hel (being)|Hela]] to release Balder. Hermod executes the seemingly hopeless task: and receives from Hela the unexpected promise that she would release Balder should everything in the upper worlds mourn Balder's death. Before returning to Asgard, Hermod speaks with Balder's shade: Balder warns him that Hela's "promises" are never what they seem - and will only bear  bitter fruit. Loki himself undertakes to frustrate the Æsir's hopes: appearing as an ugly hag in Middle Earth, he refuses to mourn for Balder - thus breaking Hela's stipulated conditions.

Hermod returns to Hell to acquaint Balder with the gods' failure. Balder accepts what has happened without surprise, and they soon part: after Balder relates his vision of the end of the worlds in the approaching conflagration of [[Ragnarök]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Matthew. Poetic Works. London: Oxford University Press, 1950.  pp. 95-ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Beyeler Foundation''' or '''Fondation Beyeler''' with its [[museum]] in [[Riehen]], near [[Basel]], owns and oversees the art collection of Hildy and [[Ernst Beyeler]].

== History ==
Art dealers Ernst Beyeler (16 July 1921 – 25 February 2010) and Hilda Kunz (1922 - 18 July 2008), known as Hildy, created the Beyeler Foundation in 1982 and commissioned [[Renzo Piano]] to design a museum to house their private collection.&lt;ref&gt;William Grimes (26 February 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/arts/design/27beyeler.html Ernst Beyeler, Top Dealer of Modern Art, Dies at 88] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was first publicly exhibited in its entirety at the [[Centro de Arte Reina Sofía]] in Madrid in 1989, and was subsequently shown at [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] in Berlin in 1993 and the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] in Sydney in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8964623 Swiss art museum founder Ernst Beyeler dies at 88] ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

By building Renzo Piano's museum structure in 1997, the Beyeler Foundation made its collection permanently accessible to the public. The museum is properly funded, and it receives annual grants from the cantons of [[Baselstadt|Basel City]] and [[Baselland|Basel County]] and the commune of Riehen.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bailey (14 June 2013), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/An+art-lovers%E2%80%99+paradise/29923 An art-lovers’ paradise]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810075417/http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/An%2Bart-lovers%E2%80%99%2Bparadise/29923 |date=10 August 2013  }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Major partners of the Foundation are Bayer AG, Novartis and Swiss bank [[UBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foundation Beyerler. Partners and Sponsors|url=https://www.fondationbeyeler.ch/en/join-support/partners-and-sponsors|publisher=Fondation Beyerle|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2006, approximately 340,000 persons visited the museum. The number of visitors in 2016 was 332,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/f7891ebc-49d5-11e7-a3f4-c742b9791d43|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection and exhibitions ==
[[File:Казимир Малевич, Супрематическая композиция, 1915.jpg|thumb|''Suprematist Composition'' (1915), oil on canvas, by [[Kazimir Malevich]]]]
The Beyeler Foundation opened its doors on 18 October 1997, presenting 140 works of modern classics, including 23 Picassos. The overall collection of 200 works of [[Modern art|classic modernism]] reflect the views of Hildy and Ernst Beyeler on 20th-century art and highlight features typical of the period from [[Claude Monet]], [[Paul Cézanne]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]] to [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and [[Francis Bacon (artist)]]. The paintings appear alongside some 25 objects of [[tribal art]] from [[African art|Africa]], [[Art of Oceania|Oceania]] and [[Alaska]]. A third of the exhibition space is reserved for special exhibitions staged to complement the permanent collection. 

The culmination of Beyeler's career came in 2007 when all the works that passed through his hands were reunited at the museum for a grand exhibition that included van Gogh's 1889 ''Portrait of Postman Roulin'', Lichtenstein's ''Plus and Minus III'' and a huge expressive drip painting by [[Jackson Pollock]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8964623 Swiss art museum founder Ernst Beyeler dies at 88] ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection is expanding, particularly in terms of works made after 1950 (recent acquisitions include pieces by [[Louise Bourgeois]] and [[Wolfgang Tillmans]]).&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bailey (14 June 2013), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/An+art-lovers%E2%80%99+paradise/29923 An art-lovers’ paradise]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810075417/http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/An%2Bart-lovers%E2%80%99%2Bparadise/29923 |date=10 August 2013  }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The garden surrounding the museum also periodically serves as a venue for special exhibitions. In a work called "Wrapped Trees", [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]] veiled 178 trees in the park around the Beyeler Foundation and in the adjacent Berower Park between 13 November and 14 December 1998.

== Architecture ==
[[File:Fond.Beyeler Garten2.JPG|thumb|''White Curves'' (2002), made of white aluminium, by [[Ellsworth Kelly]]]]
Embedded in the Berowerpark in the Basel suburb of Riehen, the building features a glazed façade largely looking out onto the corn fields and vines covering the Tüllinger Hills. The two perimeter walls of the original garden site inspired the idea of the museum’s layout. Four 115-metre-long supporting [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] walls running from north to south and standing 7m apart define the plan of the building. Resting on top of the solid foundation walls, the lightweight glass roof, white enamelled on the reverse, admits northern light but screens off light from the east and the west. Along the northern and the southern sides the roof projects far beyond the walls, shading the glass façades from the sun. Less than two years after the museum's inauguration in autumn 1997, the building was lengthened by 12 metres. This increased the exhibition area by 458 m² to its current 3,764 m².

Situated vis-à-vis the museum building, the late-Baroque Villa Berower houses the museum's administration department and a restaurant.

'''''Borderline''''' is a 1930 film, written and directed by [[Kenneth Macpherson]] and produced by the [[Pool Group]] in Territet, Switzerland. The silent film, with English inter-titles, is primarily noted for its handling of the contentious issue of inter-racial relationships, using avant-garde experimental film-making techniques, and is today very much part of the curriculum of the study of modern cinematography.

The film, which features [[Paul Robeson]], [[Bryher (novelist)|Bryher]] and [[Hilda Doolittle|HD]], was originally believed to have been lost, but was discovered, by chance, in Switzerland in 1983. An original 16mm copy of this film is now held in the Donnell Media Center, New York City Public Library. In 2006, the British Film Institute sponsored the film’s restoration by The George Eastman House and eventual DVD release with a soundtrack, composed by [[Courtney Pine]]. Its premiere at the Tate Modern gallery in London attracted 2,000 people. In 2010, the film was released with a soundtrack composed by Mallory Johns, and performed by the Southern Connecticut State University Creative Music Orchestra.

==Storyline==
The film revolves around an inter-racial love triangle and its effects on the local townsfolk. The story is based in a guesthouse occupied  by a set of liberal, hedonistic young people sympathetic to the emerging black American culture. In what would have been completely frowned upon at the time, the manageress has let out a room to a black couple, Pete Marond and his wife, Adah. Adah has an affair with Thorne, a white man, much to the dismay of the prejudiced townsfolk and Thorne's wife, Astrid. Pete attempts a reconciliation with Adah, but she eventually decides to leave him and the town. Astrid confronts Thorne on the affair and attacks him with a knife. In the scuffle, Astrid is killed. The film concludes with the aftermath of Thorne’s trial for murder and the townsfolk’s resolution of the issue.

==Cinematic Techniques==
[[Kenneth Macpherson|Macpherson]] was particularly influenced by the [[cinematic techniques]] of [[G.W. Pabst]] and [[Sergei Eisenstein]], whom he first met in 1929. In ''Borderline'', he uses avant-garde experimental film-making techniques, blending [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]’s montage innovation and [[G.W. Pabst|Pabst]]’s psycho-analytical approach, to identify the emotional and psychological states of the film’s characters. These techniques called for unconventional post-production editing, the use of light and shadow, and exaggerated movement on the part of the actors. "[[Kenneth Macpherson|Macpherson]]’s brilliance lies in his ability to photograph small movements as nuanced, meaning-producing gestures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Lost+and+Found%3A+RICHARD+DEMING+ON+KENNETH+MACPHERSON'S+MONKEYS'+MOON.-a0203139479 |title=Richard Deming |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Taking heed from the Soviet montage school of thought, [[Kenneth Macpherson|Macpherson]] incites action and reaction through a bravura demonstration of editing that wilfully distorts the viewer’s grasp of his visual rhetoric. The film bemuses with its expeditious cutting rates and its excisional framing – the latter’s reduction of human figures to dissected body parts powerfully accentuating the characters’ physical detachment from their internal desires. Together, these core tenets invoke an overwhelming tsunami of kineticism that obliterates the audience’s understanding of the film’s {{sic|nolink=y|spacial}} and temporal dimensions until all that’s left for us to cling to is an immediate, raw visceralism; the ultimate purification of the cinematic experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reehanmiah.wordpress.com/2010/12/26/borderline/ |title=Distant Voices – Reehan – Top 100 Films |publisher=Reehanmiah.wordpress.com |date=2010-12-26 |accessdate=2015-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==
"Judged on its own merits, ''Borderline'' is a ground-breaking work, dealing as it does with issues of race and sexuality at a time when such subject matter was still largely taboo and had only been previously tackled cinematically through oblique inference".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/6085279-close-up-look-at-kenneth-macphersons-borderline |title=AllVoices – Close up Look at Kenneth Macpherson's '&amp;#39;Borderline'&amp;#39; |publisher=Allvoices.com |date= |accessdate=2015-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214234900/http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/6085279-close-up-look-at-kenneth-macphersons-borderline |archivedate=14 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It would be decades before the cinematic community would once again tackle the subject matter raised in ''Borderline''. At the time of its release, ''Borderline'' was a film that confused and bewildered critics leading the London Evening Standard’s Clive MacManus to advise [[Kenneth Macpherson|Macpherson]] "to spend a year in a commercial studio" before attempting something as difficult again. Deeply upset by its hostile reception, [[Kenneth Macpherson|Macpherson]] archived his film and withdrew from film directing. [[Kenneth Macpherson|Macpherson]]’s work would go on to influence future film-makers such as [[Nathaniel Dorsky]] and [[Robert Beavers]].

==Film and legacy details==
For many years, ''Borderline'' was largely inaccessible to film scholars, with rare copies in a few archives around the world. It was seldom screened in public. Many film historians of avant garde and experimental film-making, feel that it represents one of the last examples of modernism of the 1920s, when many artists had hoped that artistic experimentation and commercial viability need not be mutually exclusive.

A booklet that [[Kenneth Macpherson|Macpherson]] and [[Hilda Doolittle|HD]] wrote to accompany the film concentrated not on narrative coherence but on psychological metaphors.  The booklet was later published in the [[Pool Group]]'s literary journal, [[Close Up (Film Journal)|Close Up]].&lt;ref&gt;Close up, 1927-1933: Cinema and Modernism – James Donald, Anne Friedberg, Laura Marcus [https://books.google.com/books?id=joAbufAs9ZMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Close+up,+1927-1933:+Cinema+and+Modernism+-+James+Donald,+Anne+Friedberg,+Laura+Marcus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yibQFz571X&amp;sig=SWvO4jiSkM7X2tzL9nSsdLOS728&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5JyXTbjHDoOAhQfd5tTjCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bottle, Glass, Fork''''' (otherwise known as '''''Bouteille, Verre, et Fourchette''''') is a painting by [[Pablo Picasso]] (1881–1973). It was painted in the spring of 1912, at the height of the development of analytic [[Cubism]].&lt;ref name=bald&gt;{{cite book|last=Baldassari|first=Anne|title=Cubist Picasso|year=2007|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-2-08-030048-5|pages=544}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Bottle, Glass, Fork'' is one of the best representations of the point in Picasso's career when his Cubist painting reached almost full abstraction. The analytic phase of Cubism was an original art movement developed by Picasso and his contemporary [[Georges Braque]] (1882–1963) and lasted from 1908-1912.&lt;ref name=henning&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henning|first=Edward|title=Pablo Picasso: Bouteille, Verre, et Fourchette|journal=The Bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art|date=September 1972|volume=59|issue=7|pages=195–203|jstor=25152438}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like ''Bottle, Glass, Fork'', the paintings of this movement are characterized by little use of color, and a complex, elegant composition of small, fragmented, tightly interwoven planes within an all-over composition of broader planes. While the figures in ''Bottle, Glass, Fork'' can be difficult to discern, the objects do emerge after careful study of the painting.

The painting is displayed in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=bottle&gt;{{cite web|title=Bottle, Glass, Fork|url=http://www.clevelandart.org/art/1972.8|work=Collections Online|publisher=Cleveland Museum of Art|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The painting==
''Bottle, Glass, Fork'' was painted with oils on canvas, in monochromatic shades of brown, grey, black, and white.  The painting itself takes an oval shape, although it is now placed in a rectangular frame that measures 93&amp;nbsp;cm tall and 76&amp;nbsp;cm wide (37&amp;nbsp;inches tall and 30&amp;nbsp;inches wide).&lt;ref name=bottle/&gt; ''Bottle, Glass, Fork'' can be seen in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], with other notable paintings by Picasso, including ''Woman in a Cape'' (1901), ''[[La Vie (painting)|La Vie]]'' (1903), and ''Harlequin with Violin'' (1918). Picasso's purpose in painting ''Bottle, Glass, Fork'' was to examine a still-life of everyday objects in terms of flat planes, thoroughly redefining their structural and spatial relationships.&lt;ref name=karmel&gt;{{cite book|last=Karmel|first=Pepe|title=Picasso and the Invention of Cubism|year=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-09436-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Picasso avoided the use of strong color in this analytical painting, instead relying on the contrasts of tonal shading in brown, gray, black and white to create forms and strengthen spatial interaction. There is no clear perspective in the painting, although a shallow sense of space can be discerned through the overlapping shapes and forms, which creates a step-by-step movement back into the picture plane.  The viewer's eye is guided around the painting and into the center by the presence of curving black lines that mimic the oval shape of the canvas, although the composition remains chiefly architectural.&lt;ref name=henning/&gt; ''Bottle, Glass, Fork'' presents a highly ordered structure that is meant to represent a still-life of objects arranged on a café table, although the forms are initially difficult to distinguish.

==Interpretation==
The title of the painting, ''Bottle, Glass, Fork'', is the first indication that Picasso is portraying a still-life, perhaps set on a table at one of the cafés in Paris that Picasso and his contemporaries frequented.&lt;ref name=bald/&gt; The bottle is the largest whole plane on the canvas, placed in the upper-left quadrant of the oval.  Its cylindrical shape is indicated by the highlights and shading, making the bottle appear rounded in comparison with the other planes.  The glass is harder to place, as there are several half-circle shapes that look as though they could represent goblets.  However, an oval atop a shaded triangle, which sits next to another shaded triangle, which are both presented above a cylindrical glass stem, form a collection of shapes that are reminiscent of a martini glass in front of and to the left of the large bottle.  The fork can be placed in the lower-right quadrant because of the short, curved black lines highlighted against a white parallelogram, indicating the prongs of the fork.  Once the prongs are found, the viewer can make out the brown handle slightly below the prongs and separated from them by a small triangle.

With the title objects placed within the painting, other objects also begin to emerge from the geometric contours.  At the very bottom and center of the painting there is a shape that resembles a key, perhaps to Picasso's art studio.  The two small, swirling shapes diagonally to the right of the key might represent croissants to go along with the drinks in the bottle.  Above the swirls there is a somewhat naturalistic depiction of a knife receding into space, indicating to the viewer that these objects actually do sit on a table that is both receding back and tilting up towards the surface of the painting.

Other significant compositional elements within ''Bottle, Glass, Fork'' have nothing to do with the title of the work, but are found in the letters that Picasso included, half-hidden behind the overlapping shapes.  The most obvious are the bold, black letters, EAN above ARIS on a white background, which recalls a poster or a folded newspaper.  “ARIS” most likely indicates the word “PARIS,” but the EAN could indicate multiple meanings.  It could be the word OCEAN, which would correspond with the nautical theme of the dockside café scenes in some of Picasso's previous still life paintings.&lt;ref name=karmel/&gt;  Because of Picasso's tendency to reveal his radical political tendencies even in his most apolitical still lifes, it has been speculated that EAN forms part of the title of an anarchist Parisian newspaper, ''[[L'Intransigeant]]'', or ''The Intransigent''.&lt;ref name=henning/&gt; The other set of letters is found on the upper left of the canvas and read “e 20.”  These letters look as if they have been stenciled onto a streaky brown background resembling wood, indicating that they may be a part of a wooden sign.  It is most likely that the letters refer to “Café 20,” a popular meeting place for artists in ''[[fin de siècle]]'' Paris.&lt;ref name=karmel/&gt;  This gives the viewer a final placement for the still-life, letting us know that we are seeing an everyday table setting in a liberal café that Picasso, his patrons, and their contemporaries frequented, where they could drink and exchange ideas about politics as they read the anarchist newspaper, art, literature, and their rapidly changing culture.&lt;ref name=henning/&gt;

==Background and development==

===Paul Cézanne===
Picasso and Braque's main source of inspiration when developing Cubism came from the still-life paintings of the Impressionist artist [[Paul Cézanne]] (1839–1906).&lt;ref name=henning/&gt;  Unlike many of his contemporary Impressionist painters, Cézanne was not concerned with capturing the ephemeral effects of light reflected off of the surfaces found in nature.  Rather, he focused on creating an image of his “sensation” of the world, which he perceived as filled with solid, enduring forms.  Cézanne integrated these forms into the space he creating within his paintings while still respecting the flatness of the painted canvas; an example is his still life ''[[Basket of Apples]]'' (1895).&lt;ref name=schapiro&gt;{{cite book|last=Schapiro|first=Meyer|title=Cezanne|year=1988|publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc|location=New York|isbn=0-8109-1043-8|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; His blocky brushstrokes lay parallel to the picture plane, creating a tension between flatness and spatial relationships that is found in ''Glass, Bottle, Fork''. Cézanne also relied on the use of multiple perspectives in one painting to capture a sensation within an image, a principle that would become central to Picasso's cubism.&lt;ref name=henning/&gt;

===Gustave Courbet===
A less obvious, but still significant, influence on analytical Cubism is the leader of the 19th-century Realist movement, [[Gustave Courbet]] (1819–1877).&lt;ref name=henning/&gt;  Courbet painted figural compositions, landscapes, and still lifes.  He gained notoriety for commenting on social issues in his works and painting subject matter that was considered to be too vulgar to be painted, like the life of the peasants, the working conditions of the poor, and prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nochlin|first=Linda|title=Courbet|year=2007|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-28676-0|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although their work seems drastically different at first glance, Courbet's influence on Cubism can be found in Picasso's underlying goals.  Just as Courbet attempted to present a realistic vision of his world, in ''Bottle, Glass, Fork'' Picasso attempts to create an accurate representation of the table in the café.  Picasso's method of realism is not an accurate optical imitation of the natural world, but a more inclusive type of realism. He included many perspectives of an object and relied on the associations made in the mind of the viewer because of their own sensory experiences with the objects.&lt;ref name=henning/&gt; An example of this is ''[[The Stone Breakers]]'' (1850).

==Painting as language==
Picasso's works are often analyzed in terms of their relation to language. When attempting to make sense of Picasso's most sophisticated analytical Cubist paintings, many art historians approach the paintings as a branch of the hermetic language that art historian Natasha Staller described in her article, “Babel: Hermetic Languages, Universal Languages, and Anti-Languages in ''Fin de Siècle'' Parisian Culture.”&lt;ref name=staller&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staller|first=Natasha|title=Babel: Hermetic Languages, Universal Languages, and Anti- Languages in Fin de Siecle Parisian Culture.|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=June 1994|volume=76|issue=2|pages=331–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Hermeticism (history of science)|Hermetic]] languages are like codes and actually conceal a meaning that can only be deciphered by those privileged enough to have the key to breaking the code.&lt;ref name=staller/&gt;  Picasso seems to be actively employing this concept in ''Bottle, Glass, Fork''.  Although Picasso is dealing with very concrete subject matter, he has rejected the literal meaning of objects, instead preferring to create art that was “intentionally cryptic and obscure” and required that one be privy to the intellectual code of Cubist aesthetics and to understand the details of the alternative society of artists and intellectuals in which Picasso lived and worked.&lt;ref name=staller/&gt;

==Impact on future art==
The influence of analytical Cubist work like ''Bottle, Glass, Fork'' on future artist movements was enormous.  Picasso and Braque created a highly original method of relating objects to each other within space, developing a technique of painting that created a whole sensory experience rather than just a visual experience. Their ideas and structure have influenced later movements like [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], [[Futurism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Dadaism]], [[Purism (arts)|Purism]], [[Synchromism]], and every genre of later abstract art.&lt;ref name=henning/&gt;

'''''Campbell's Soup Cans''''',&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; which is sometimes referred to as '''''32 Campbell's Soup Cans''''',&lt;ref&gt;Frazier, p. 708.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[work of art]] produced in 1962 by [[Andy Warhol]]. It consists of thirty-two canvases, each measuring {{convert|20|in|cm}} in height × {{convert|16|in|cm}} in width and each consisting of a painting of a [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's Soup]] can—one of each of the [[canned soup]] varieties the company offered at the time.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=79809|accessdate=March 9, 2007|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art|year=2007|title=The Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual paintings were produced by a [[printmaking]] method—the semi-mechanized [[screen printing]] process, using a non-[[painterly]] style. ''Campbell's Soup Cans''' reliance on themes from [[popular culture]] helped to usher in [[pop art]] as a major [[art movement]] in the United States.&lt;!-- Feel free to change popular culture to mass culture if pop and popular in the same sentence seems redundant. I don't think that will be the case here since they both are used in linked terms. --&gt;

Warhol, a commercial [[illustrator]] who became a successful author, publisher, painter, and film director, showed the work on July 9, 1962, in his first one-man [[art gallery|gallery]] exhibition as a [[fine artist]]&lt;ref name="An38"&gt;Angell, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="L32"&gt;Livingstone, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Ferus Gallery]] of Los Angeles, California. The exhibition marked the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] debut of pop art.&lt;ref name="L158"&gt;Lippard, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of the semi-mechanized process, the non-painterly style, and the commercial subject initially caused offense, as the work's blatantly mundane commercialism represented a direct affront to the technique and philosophy of [[abstract expressionism]]. In the United States the abstract expressionism art movement was dominant during the post-[[World War II|war]] period, and it held not only to "fine art" values and [[aesthetics]] but also to a [[Mysticism|mystical]] inclination. This controversy led to a great deal of debate about the merits and ethics of such work. Warhol's motives as an artist were questioned, and they continue to be topical to this day. The large public commotion helped transform Warhol from being an accomplished 1950s commercial illustrator to a notable fine artist, and it helped distinguish him from other rising pop artists. Although commercial demand for his paintings was not immediate, Warhol's association with the subject led to his name becoming synonymous with the ''Campbell's Soup Can'' paintings.

Warhol subsequently produced a wide variety of art works depicting Campbell's Soup cans during three distinct phases of his career, and he produced other works using a variety of images from the world of commerce and mass media. Today, the Campbell's Soup cans [[Theme (visual arts)|theme]] is generally used in reference to the original set of paintings as well as the later Warhol drawings and paintings depicting Campbell's Soup cans. Because of the eventual popularity of the entire series of similarly themed works, Warhol's reputation grew to the point where he was not only the most-renowned American pop art artist,&lt;ref name="ArtHistory"&gt;Stokstad, p. 1130.&lt;/ref&gt; but also the highest-priced living American artist.&lt;ref name="W307"&gt;Bourdon p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New York art scene ===
Warhol arrived in New York City in 1949, directly from the [[Carnegie Mellon College of Fine Arts|School of Fine Arts]] at [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="L31"&gt;Livingstone, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; He quickly achieved success as a commercial illustrator, and his first published drawing appeared in the Summer 1949 issue of ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, he had his first art gallery show at the [[Bodley Gallery]] with a display of [[Truman Capote]]-inspired works.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1955, he was tracing photographs borrowed from the [[New York Public Library]]'s photo collection with the hired assistance of Nathan Gluck, and reproducing them with a process he had developed earlier as a collegian at Carnegie Tech. His process, which foreshadowed his later work, involved pressing wet ink illustrations against adjoining paper.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s, he had regular showings of his drawings, and exhibited at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (''Recent Drawings'', 1956).&lt;ref name="L31" /&gt;

=== Pop art ===
In 1960, Warhol began producing his first canvases, which he based on comic strip subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison and Wood, p. 730.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1961, he learned the process of [[silkscreen]]ing from Floriano Vecchi,&lt;ref name="Wat79"&gt;Watson, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; who had run the Tiber Press since 1953. Though the process generally begins with a [[stencil]] drawing, it often evolves from a blown up photograph which is then transferred with glue onto silk. In either case, one needs to produce a glue-based version of a positive two-dimensional image (positive means that open spaces are left where the paint will appear). Usually, the ink is rolled across the medium so that it passes through the silk and not the glue.&lt;ref name="W&amp;H"&gt;Warhol and Hackett, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell's Soup cans were among Warhol's first silkscreen productions; the first were [[United States one-dollar bill|U.S. dollar bills]]. The pieces were made from stencils; one for each color. Warhol did not begin to convert photographs to silkscreens until after the original series of Campbell's Soup cans had been produced.&lt;ref name="W123"&gt;Bourdon, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Warhol Campbell's Soup Can (Tomato) 1962 Pencil on paper.jpg|thumb|''Campbell's Soup Can (Tomato)'', 1962. Stencils such as this are the basis for silkscreening.]]

Although Warhol had produced silkscreens of [[comic strips]] and of other [[pop art]] subjects, he supposedly relegated himself to soup cans as a subject at the time to avoid competing with the more finished style of comics by [[Roy Lichtenstein]].&lt;ref name="W109"&gt;Bourdon, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; He once said "I've got to do something that really will have a lot of impact that will be different enough from Lichtenstein and [[James Rosenquist]], that will be very personal, that won't look like I'm doing exactly what they're doing."&lt;ref name="Wat79"&gt;Watson, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1962, Lichtenstein displayed at a sold-out exhibition of [[cartoon]] pictures at [[Leo Castelli]]'s eponymous Leo Castelli Gallery, ending the possibility of Warhol exhibiting his own cartoon paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdon, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Castelli had visited Warhol's gallery in 1961 and said that the work he saw there was too similar to Lichtenstein's,&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angell, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; although Warhol's and Lichtenstein's comic artwork differed in subject and techniques (e.g., Warhol's comic-strip figures were humorous pop culture caricatures such as [[Popeye]], while Lichtenstein's were generally of stereotypical hero and heroines, inspired by comic strips devoted to adventure and romance).&lt;ref&gt;Angell, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Castelli chose not to represent both artists at that time. [He would, in November 1964, be exhibiting Warhol, his ''Flower Paintings'', and then again Warhol in 1966.&lt;ref name="Syl"&gt;Sylvester, p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;] Lichtenstein's 1962 show was quickly followed by [[Wayne Thiebaud]]'s April 17, 1962 one-man show at the Allan Stone Gallery featuring all-American foods, which agitated Warhol as he felt it jeopardized his own food-related soup can works.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdon, pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Warhol was considering returning to the Bodley gallery, but the Bodley's director did not like his pop art works.&lt;ref name="Wat79" /&gt; In 1961, Warhol was offered a three-man show by Allan Stone at the latter's 18 East 82nd Street Gallery with Rosenquist and [[Robert Indiana]], but all three were insulted by this proposition.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdon, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irving Blum was the first dealer to show Warhol's soup can paintings.&lt;ref name="An38" /&gt; Blum happened to be visiting Warhol in May 1962, at a time when Warhol was being featured in a May 11, 1962 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine [[Article (publishing)|article]] "The Slice-of-Cake School" &lt;ref name="TimeCake" /&gt; (that included a portion of Warhol's silkscreened ''200 One Dollar Bills''), along with Lichtenstein, Rosenquist, and [[Wayne Thiebaud]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson p. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Warhol was the only artist whose photograph actually appeared in the article, which is indicative of his knack for manipulating the mass media.&lt;ref name="W110"&gt;Bourdon, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Blum saw dozens of Campbell's Soup can variations, including a grid of ''One-Hundred Soup Cans'' that day.&lt;ref name="W109" /&gt; Blum was shocked that Warhol had no [[Art gallery|gallery]] arrangement and offered him a July show at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. This would be Warhol's first one-man show of his pop art.&lt;ref name="An38" /&gt;&lt;ref name="L32" /&gt; Warhol was assured by Blum that the newly founded ''[[Artforum]] magazine'', which had an office above the gallery, would cover the show. Not only was the show Warhol's first solo gallery exhibit, but it was considered to be the West Coast premiere of pop art.&lt;ref name="L158" /&gt;  Andy Warhol's first New York solo Pop exhibit was hosted at Eleanor Ward's Stable Gallery November 6–24, 1962. The exhibit included the works ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'', ''[[Green Coca-Cola Bottles]]'', and ''Campbell's Soup Cans''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/chron/192862.html|title=Andy Warhol Chronology|accessdate=November 8, 2008|publisher=warholstars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The premiere ==

[[File:Cheddar Cheese crop from Campbells Soup Cans MOMA.jpg|thumb|left|Golden banners make the ''Cheddar Cheese'' canvas from ''Campbell's Soup Cans'', 1962 unique.]]

Warhol sent Blum thirty-two {{convert|20|x|16|in|mm|adj=on}} canvases of Campbell's Soup can portraits, each representing a particular variety of the Campbell's Soup flavors available at the time.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; The thirty-two canvases are very similar: each is a realistic depiction of the iconic, mostly red and white Campbell's Soup can silkscreened onto a white background. The canvases have minor variation in the lettering of the variety names. Most of the letterings are painted in red letters. Four varieties have black lettering: ''Clam Chowder'' has parenthetical black lettering below the variety name that said ''([[Clam Chowder#Manhattan clam chowder|Manhattan Style]])'', which means that the soup is tomato- and broth-based instead of the cream-based New England style; ''Beef'' has parenthetical black lettering below the variety name that says ''(With Vegetables and Barley)''; ''Scotch Broth'' has parenthetical black lettering below the variety name that said ''(A Hearty Soup)''; and ''Minestrone'' had black parenthetical lettering saying ''(Italian-Style Vegetable Soup)''. There are two varieties with red lettered parenthetical labels: ''Beef Broth (Bouillon)'' and ''Consommé (Beef).'' The font sizes only vary slightly in the variety names. However, there are a few notable stylistic font differences. ''Old-fashioned Tomato Rice'' is the only variety with lower case script. This lower case script appears to be from a slightly different font than the other variety name letters. There are other stylistic differences. ''Old-fashioned Tomato Rice'' has the word ''Soup'' depicted lower on the can, in place of a portion of ornamental starlike symbols at the bottom that the other 31 varieties have. Also, ''Cheddar Cheese'' has two banner-like addenda. In the middle-left, a small golden banner says "New!", and a middle center golden banner says "Great As A Sauce Too!".

The [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] opened on July 9, 1962, with Warhol absent. The thirty-two single soup can canvases were placed in a single line, much like products on shelves, each displayed on narrow individual ledges.&lt;ref name="AS60"&gt;Archer, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary impact was uneventful, but the historical impact is considered today to have been a watershed. The gallery audience was unsure what to make of the exhibit. A [[John Coplans]] ''Artforum'' article, which was in part spurred on by the responding display of dozens of soup cans by a nearby gallery with a display advertising them at three for 60 cents, encouraged people to take a stand on Warhol.&lt;ref name="Wat80"&gt;Watson p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourdon, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Few actually saw the paintings at the Los Angeles exhibit or at Warhol's [[studio]], but word spread in the form of controversy and scandal due to the work's seeming attempt to replicate the appearance of manufactured [[Object (philosophy)|objects]].&lt;ref&gt;Bourdon, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Extended debate on the merits and ethics of focusing one's efforts on such a mundane commercial inanimate model kept Warhol's work in art world conversations. The pundits could not believe an artist would reduce the art form to the equivalent of a trip to the local grocery store. Talk did not translate into monetary success for Warhol. [[Dennis Hopper]] was the first of only a half dozen to pay $100 for a canvas. Blum decided to try to keep the thirty-two canvases as an intact set and bought back the few sales. This pleased Warhol who had conceived of them as a set, and he agreed to sell the set for ten monthly $100 [[Installment plan|installments]] to Blum.&lt;ref name="W123" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wat80" /&gt; Warhol had passed the milestone of his first serious art show. While this exhibition was on view in Los Angeles, Martha Jackson canceled another planned December 1962 New York exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Watson pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ferus show closed on August 4, 1962, the day before [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s death. Warhol went on to purchase a Monroe publicity still from the film [[Niagara (film)|Niagara]], which he later cropped and used to create one of his most well-known works: his painting of Marilyn. Although Warhol continued painting other pop art, including Martinson's coffee cans, [[Coca-Cola]] bottles, [[S&amp;H Green Stamps]], and Campbell's Soup cans, he soon became known to many as the artist who painted celebrities. He returned to Blum's gallery to exhibit [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] and [[Elizabeth Taylor|Liz]] in October 1963.&lt;ref name="An38" /&gt; His fans Dennis Hopper and [[Brooke Hayward]] (Hopper's wife at the time) held a welcoming party for the event.&lt;ref&gt;Angell, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Warhol gave no indication of a definitive ordering of the collection, the sequence chosen by [[MoMA]] (in the picture at the upper right of this article) in the display from their permanent [[Collection (museum)|collection]] reflects the chronological order in which the varieties were introduced by the Campbell Soup Company, beginning with ''Tomato'' in the upper left, which debuted in 1897.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; By April 2011, the curators at the MoMA had reordered the varieties, moving ''Clam Chowder'' to the upper left and ''Tomato'' to the bottom of the four rows.&lt;ref name=MoMA /&gt;

== Motivation ==
[[File:100 Cans.jpg|thumb|''100 Cans'', 1962. Example of the variations that Blum saw when determining to introduce him by exhibit.]]

Several [[Anecdote|anecdotal]] stories supposedly explain why Warhol chose Campbell's Soup cans as the focal point of his pop art. One reason is that he needed a new subject after he abandoned comic strips, a move taken in part due to his respect for the refined work of [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. According to Ted Carey—one of Warhol's commercial art assistants in the late 1950s—it was [[Muriel Latow]] who suggested the idea for both the soup cans and Warhol's early U.S. dollar paintings.&lt;ref name="Warholstars"&gt;{{cite web |author= Comenas, Gary |url= http://www.warholstars.org/art/warhol/soup.html |title= Warholstars: The Origin of the Soup Cans |publisher = warholstars.org | accessdate = January 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muriel Latow was then an aspiring [[interior decorator]], and owner of the Latow Art Gallery in the [[Upper East Side|East 60s]] in Manhattan. She told Warhol that he should paint "Something you see every day and something that everybody would recognize. Something like a can of Campbell's Soup." Ted Carey, who was there at the time, said that Warhol responded by exclaiming: "Oh that sounds fabulous." According to Carey, Warhol went to a supermarket the following day and bought a case of "all the soups", which Carey said he saw when he stopped by Warhol's apartment the next day. When the art critic G. R. Swenson asked Warhol in 1963 why he painted soup cans, the artist replied, "I used to drink it, I used to have the same lunch every day, for twenty years."&lt;ref name="Warholstars" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison and Wood, p. 732. Republished from Swenson, G. R., "What is Pop Art? Interviews with Eight Painters (Part I)," ''ARTnews'', New York, November 7, 1963, reprinted in John Russell and Suzi Gabik (eds.), ''Pop Art Redefined'', London, 1969, pp. 116–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another account of Latow's influence on Warhol holds that she asked him what he loved most, and because he replied "money" she suggested that he paint U.S. dollar bills.&lt;ref name="AW"&gt;Marcade p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this story, Latow later advised that in addition to painting money he should paint something else very simple, such as Campbell's Soup cans.

In an interview for London's ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' in 1985, David Yarritu asked Warhol about flowers that Warhol's mother made from [[tin can]]s. In his response, Warhol mentioned them as one of the reasons behind his first tin can paintings:
: David Yarritu: I heard that your mother used to make these little tin flowers and sell them to help support you in the early days.
: Andy Warhol: Oh God, yes, it's true, the tin flowers were made out of those fruit cans, that's the reason why I did my first tin-can paintings ... You take a tin-can, the bigger the tin-can the better, like the family size ones that peach halves come in, and I think you cut them with scissors. It's very easy and you just make flowers out of them. My mother always had lots of cans around, including the soup cans.&lt;ref name="Warholstars" /&gt;

Several stories mention that Warhol's choice of soup cans reflected his own avid devotion to Campbell's soup as a consumer. [[Robert Indiana]] once said: "I knew Andy very well. The reason he painted soup cans is that he liked soup."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Comenas, Gary |url= http://www.warholstars.org/art/warhol/soup.html |title= Warholstars |publisher= New York Times|date=December 1, 2002 |accessdate=December 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was thought to have focused on them because they composed a daily dietary staple.&lt;ref&gt;Faerna, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Others observed that Warhol merely painted things he held close at [[Heart (symbol)|heart]]. He enjoyed eating Campbell's soup, had a taste for Coca-Cola, loved money, and admired movie stars. Thus, they all became subjects of his work. Yet another account says that his daily lunches in his studio consisted of Campbell's Soup and Coca-Cola, and thus, his inspiration came from seeing the empty cans and bottles accumulate on his desk.&lt;ref&gt;Baal-Teshuva, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol did not choose the cans because of business relationships with the Campbell Soup Company. Even though the company at the time sold four out of every five cans of prepared soup in the United States, Warhol preferred that the company not be involved "because the whole point would be lost with any kind of commercial [[tie-in]]."&lt;ref name="W90"&gt;Bourdon, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1965, the company knew him well enough that he was able to coax actual can labels from them to use as invitations for an exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;Warhol and Hackett p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; They even commissioned a canvas.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdon, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Message ==
Warhol had a positive view of ordinary culture and felt the [[abstract expressionist]]s had taken great pains to ignore the splendor of [[modernity]].&lt;ref name="ArtHistory" /&gt; The ''Campbell's Soup Can'' series, along with his other series, provided him with a chance to express his positive view of modern culture. However, his [[deadpan]] manner endeavored to be devoid of emotional and social commentary.&lt;ref name="ArtHistory" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Random House Library of Painting and Sculpture Volume 4, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was intended to be without personality or individual expression.&lt;ref name="TDoA"&gt;Warin, Vol 32, p. 862.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, Vol 5., p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Warhol's view is encapsulated&lt;ref name="W110" /&gt; in the ''Time'' magazine description of the 'Slice of Cake School,' that "... a group of painters have come to the common conclusion that the most banal and even vulgar trappings of modern civilization can, when transposed to canvas, become Art."&lt;ref name="TimeCake"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Slice-of-Cake School|journal=Time|date=May 11, 1962|volume=79|issue=19|page=52|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,939397,00.html|accessdate=December 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His pop art work differed from serial works by artists such as [[Monet]], who used series to represent discriminating [[perception]] and show that a painter could recreate shifts in time, light, season, and weather with hand and eye. Warhol is now understood to represent the modern era of commercialization and indiscriminate "sameness." When Warhol eventually showed variation it was not "realistic." His later variations in color were almost a mockery of discriminating perception. His adoption of the pseudo-industrial silkscreen process spoke against the use of a series to demonstrate subtlety. Warhol sought to reject invention and nuance by creating the appearance that his work had been printed,&lt;ref name="TDoA" /&gt; &lt;!--His series represented sameness right or wrong to the extent that even imperfections in his images were reproduced without correction.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} Unable to find quote again--&gt; and he systematically recreated imperfections.&lt;ref name="AW" /&gt; His series work helped him escape Lichtenstein's lengthening shadow.&lt;ref name="W96"&gt;Bourdon, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Although his soup cans were not as shocking and vulgar as some of his other early pop art, they still offended the art world's sensibilities that had developed so as to partake in the intimate emotions of artistic expression.&lt;ref name="TDoA" /&gt;

Contrasting against [[Caravaggio]]'s sensual baskets of fruit, [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin|Chardin]]'s plush peaches, or [[Cézanne]]'s vibrant arrangements of apples, the mundane ''Campbell's Soup Cans'' gave the art world a chill. Furthermore, the idea of isolating eminently recognizable pop culture items was ridiculous enough to the art world that both the merits and ethics of the work were perfectly reasonable debate topics for those who had not even seen the piece.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdon, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Warhol's pop art can be seen as a relation to [[Minimal art]] in the sense that it attempts to portray objects in their most simple, immediately recognizable form. Pop art eliminates overtones and undertones that would otherwise be associated with representations.&lt;ref name="lucie"&gt;Lucie-Smith, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol clearly changed the concept of art appreciation. Instead of harmonious three-dimensional arrangements of objects, he chose mechanical derivatives of commercial illustration with an emphasis on the packaging.&lt;ref name="W90" /&gt; His variations of multiple soup cans, for example, made the process of repetition an appreciated technique: "If you take a Campbell's Soup can and repeat it fifty times, you are not interested in the retinal image. According to [[Marcel Duchamp]], what interests you is the concept that wants to put fifty Campbell's Soup cans on a canvas."&lt;ref&gt;Constable, Rosalind, "New York's Avant Garde and How it Got There," New York Herald Tribune, May 17, 1964, p. 10. cited in Bourdon, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The regimented multiple can depictions almost become an abstraction whose details are less important than the panorama.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdon, pp. 92–96.&lt;/ref&gt; In a sense, the representation was more important than that which was represented.&lt;ref name="lucie"/&gt; Warhol's interest in machinelike creation during his early pop art days was misunderstood by those in the art world, whose value system was threatened by mechanization.&lt;ref&gt;Lippard, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, audiences had a very different take on his work. Many perceived it as a subversive and [[Marxism|Marxist]] satire on American capitalism.&lt;ref name="W90" /&gt; If not subversive, it was at least considered a Marxist critique of pop culture.&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Given Warhol's apolitical outlook in general this is not likely the intended message. It is likely that his pop art was nothing more than an attempt to attract attention to his work.&lt;ref name="W90" /&gt;

In an effort to complement the message of his art, Warhol developed a pop persona after the mass media took note of his pop art. He began to manifest a teenage-like image, immersing himself in pop culture such as [[Rock &amp; Roll]] shows and fan magazines. Whereas previous artists used repetition to demonstrate their skill at depicting variation, Warhol coupled "repetition" with "monotony" as he professed his love of artwork themes.

Warhol followed the success of his original series with several related works incorporating the same theme of Campbell's Soup cans subjects. These subsequent works along with the original are collectively referred to as the Campbell's Soup cans series and often simply as the Campbell's Soup cans. The subsequent Campbell's Soup can works were very diverse. The heights ranged from {{convert|20|in|mm}} to {{convert|6|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdon, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the cans were portrayed as if they were freshly produced cans without flaws. Occasionally, he chose to depict cans with torn [[label]]s, peeling labels, crushed bodies, or opened [[Lid (container)|lids]] (images right). Sometimes he added related items like a bowl of soup or a can opener (in the image on the right below). Sometimes he produced images of related items without any soup cans such as the box sculpture ''Campbell's Tomato Juice Box'' (above left), which are not strictly a part of the series although a part of the theme. Many of these [[Work of art|works]] were now being produced at the already acclaimed studio, "[[The Factory]]."

Irving Blum made the original thirty-two canvases available to the public through an arrangement with the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, DC by placing them on permanent loan two days before Warhol's death.&lt;ref name="AW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AS185"&gt;Archer, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the original ''Campbell's Soup Cans'' is now a part of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] permanent collection.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; A print called ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans II]]'' is part of the permanent collection of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Chicago. ''200 Campbell's Soup Cans'', 1962 (Acrylic on canvas, 72&amp;nbsp;inches x 100&amp;nbsp;inches), in the private collection of John and Kimiko Powers is the largest single canvas of the Campbell's Soup can paintings. It is composed of ten rows and twenty columns of numerous flavors of soups. Experts point to it as one of the most significant works of pop art both as a pop representation and as conjunction with immediate predecessors such as [[Jasper Johns]] and the successors movements of Minimal and Conceptual art.&lt;ref&gt;Lucie-Smith, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The very similar ''100 Cans'' from the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]] collection is shown above. The earliest soup can painting seems to be ''Campbell's Soup Can (Tomato Rice),'' a 1960 ink, tempera, crayon, and oil canvas.&lt;ref name="W99"&gt;Bourdon p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many of the works, including the original series, Warhol drastically simplified the gold medallion that appears on Campbell's Soup cans by replacing the paired allegorical figures with a flat yellow disk.&lt;ref name="W90" /&gt; In most variations, the only hint of three-dimensionality came from the shading on the tin lid. Otherwise the image was flat. The works with torn labels are perceived as metaphors of life in the sense that even packaged food must meet its end. They are often described as expressionistic.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdon, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1970, Warhol established the record auction price for a painting by a living American artist with a $60,000 sale of ''Big Campbell's Soup Can with Torn Label (Vegetable Beef)'' (1962) in a sale at [[Parke-Bernet]], the preeminent American auction house of the day (later acquired by [[Sotheby's]]).&lt;ref name="W307" /&gt; This record was broken a few months later by his rival for the artworld's attention and approval, Lichtenstein, who sold a depiction of a giant brush stroke, ''[[Big Painting No. 6]]'' (1965) for $75,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Record Prices for Art Auction at New York Auction|author=Hahn, Susan|accessdate=May 12, 2012|date=November 19, 1970|page=29|work=[[Lowell Sun]]|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/lowell-sun/1970-11-19/page-29/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The broad variety of work produced using a semi-mechanized process with many collaborators, Warhol's popularity, the value of his works, and the diversity of works across various media and genre have created a need for the [[Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board]] to certify the [[Authenticity in art|authenticity]] of works by Warhol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warholfoundation.org/authen.htm |accessdate=March 9, 2007 |title= The Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board, Inc. |publisher=Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080117130318/http://www.warholfoundation.org/authen.htm |archivedate = January 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 7, 2016, seven ''Campbell's Soup Cans'' prints were stolen from the [http://www.springfieldmo.gov/art/ Springfield Art Museum].

Warhol's production of Campbell's Soup can works underwent three distinct phases. The first took place in 1962, during which he created realistic images, and produced numerous pencil drawings of the subject.&lt;ref name="W96" /&gt; In 1965, {{anchor|altered colors}}Warhol revisited the theme while arbitrarily replacing the original red and white colors with a wider variety of hues. In the late 1970s, he again returned to the soup cans while [[Mirror image|inverting]] and reversing the images.&lt;ref name="W99" /&gt; Some in the art world consider Warhol's work completed after [[Andy Warhol#Attempted assassination|his 1968 shooting]]—which occurred the day before the [[Bobby Kennedy]] assassination&lt;ref name="AS185" /&gt;—to be less significant than that done before it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Hughes, Robert | title= American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America | publisher=Knopf, Alfred A. Incorporated |date=April 1997 | url= http://www.artchive.com/artchive/W/warhol.html | accessdate=December 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best-remembered Warhol Campbell's Soup can works are from the first phase. Warhol is further regarded for his iconic serial celebrity silkscreens of such people as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Marilyn Monroe]]  and [[Liz Taylor]], produced during his 1962–1964 silkscreening phase. His most commonly repeated painting subjects are Taylor, Monroe, Presley, [[Jackie Kennedy]] and similar celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvester, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being a notable fine artist, Warhol was a renowned cinematographer, author, and commercial illustrator. Posthumously, he became the subject of the largest single-artist art museum in the United States in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Regarding Warhol: Sixty Artists, Fifty Years|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|isbn=978-0300184983|page=272|date=2012|author=various authors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FTSLCLiRV84C&amp;pg=PA272&amp;lpg=PA272&amp;dq=largest+single-artist+art+museum+in+the+United+States&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hTD1hbKax1&amp;sig=8IMv1_UZ_n6w4O0neBu9MM7Zpcw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwin4cXMysfKAhXGtYMKHRFVC7UQ6AEIRDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=largest%20single-artist%20art%20museum%20in%20the%20United%20States&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url= https://www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/pghconnections/places/warhol.html |title= The Andy Warhol Museum: 117 Sandusky Street |publisher = Carnegie Mellon University | accessdate = January 24, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613120539/https://www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/pghconnections/places/warhol.html|archivedate=June 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Note there is a 2006 reference to it being the largest single artist museum in the world [http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06121/689575-37.stm], I am not sure about its credibility --&gt; Many Warhol art exhibits include footage of his cinematic directorial efforts (e.g., The Museum of Contemporary Art's ANDY WARHOL/SUPERNOVA: Stars, Deaths, Disasters, 1962–1964 that ran from March 18, 2006 – June 18, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |title=Past Exhibitions: ANDY WARHOL/SUPERNOVA: Stars, Deaths, Disasters, 1962–1964 |publisher=Museum of Contemporary Art |year=2006 |url=http://www.mcachicago.org/exhibitions/exh_detail.php?id=1&amp;syear=2006 |accessdate=January 8, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222705/http://www.mcachicago.org/exhibitions/exh_detail.php?id=1&amp;syear=2006 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some say his contributions as an artist pale in comparison to his contributions as a film-maker.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvester, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; Others make it clear that he was not the most conventionally skilled artist of his day.&lt;ref&gt;Lippard, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, his techniques were emulated by other highly respected artists&lt;ref&gt;Lippard, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and his works continue to command high prices.

'''Caroline Pounds''' (née Elam) (''fl.'' 1840-1880) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] watercolour artist. She produced studies of plants and birds of New Guinea and Australia.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=Paul|title=Caroline Pounds|url=https://www.daao.org.au/bio/caroline-pounds/biography/|website=Design &amp; Art Australia Online|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caroline Pounds|url=http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/hi/gnt/dsi2/index.php?table_name=dsi&amp;function=details&amp;where_field=id&amp;where_value=5691|website=Database of Scientific Illustrators|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
There is little known about Caroline Pounds. She was born Caroline Elam and a descendent of Yorkshire [[Quakers]], the daughter of Lt. Joseph Elam (d. 1829). She married Dr James Baker Pounds, Protestant apothecary and entrepreneur, of [[New Ross]], [[County Wexford]] (d. 1884).&lt;ref name=Bocking2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bocking|first1=Brian|title=Flagging Up Buddhism: Charles Pfoundes (Omoie Tetzunostzuke) Among the International Congresses and Expositions, 1893 – 1905|journal=Contemporary Buddhismn Interdisciplinary Journal|date=2013|volume=14|issue=1|pages=17–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple's eldest son, Joseph Elam Pounds, was born in 1838 at Moathill, [[County Waterford]].&lt;ref name=Fox /&gt; The family had emigrated to [[Sydney]] around 1846, as they appear to have been bankrupted by the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]].&lt;ref name=Bocking /&gt; Dr Pounds' obituary stated that he initially worked in [[Ballarat]], Victoria. Having lost a large amount of money on imported mining machinery he intended to sell, he worked as the medical officer at [[HM Prison Pentridge]] until 1862. He was then appointed the corner for the Sandhurst ([[Bendigo]]) district, retiring in 1877. After this, he and Pounds travelled to places such as [[Japan]] to visit their youngest son, [[Charles J. W. Pfoundes]].&lt;ref name=Fox /&gt; More recent research into their son Charles, indicates that the couple separated when he was 6 years old in 1846, that he was raised solely by his father and that he emigrated to Australia alone.&lt;ref name=Bocking&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bocking|first1=Brian|last2=Cox|first2=Laurence|last3=Yoshinaga|first3=Shin‘ichi|title=The First Buddhist Mission to the West: Charles Pfoundes and the London Buddhist mission of 1889 – 1892|journal=Diskus: The Journal of the British Association for the Study of Religions|date=2014|volume=16|issue=3|pages=1–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Pounds' work is undated, but that which is marked 1846.&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt; Bocking believes that Pounds did not live in Australia continuously, rather she spent a period of time there 1846 before returning to Ireland where she died in 1898.&lt;ref name=Bocking2 /&gt;

Their elder son Joseph, who was a widower with two children, married Lilias Ibbotson of [[Geelong]] in 1874.&lt;ref name=Fox /&gt; Pounds' drawings were discovered in the Ibbotson's family home, ''The Heights'', by the [[National Trust of Australia (Victoria)|Victoria National Trust]] in the 1980s and they remain there on display.&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Patricia|title=Irish Botanical Illustrators &amp; Flower Painters|date=2000|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|location=Suffolk|isbn=9781851493579|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic work==
Pounds produced a small number of plant and bird studies in Australia and [[New Guinea]], which are believed to date from the 1840s to the 1880s. Subjects include ''[[Dianella (plant)|Dianella]]'', Rosehip, and Blackberry, as well as a New Guinea bird of paradise.&lt;ref name=Fox /&gt; They are painted in an oriental style, showing influence from Chinese and Japanese export art. This is possibly due to the fact that their youngest son served the [[Emperor of Japan]] and was a Government interpreter. The paintings are decorative, executed in a ''[[chinoiserie]]'' style on rice paper.&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt;

'''Chromoxylography''' was a colour [[woodblock printing]] process, popular from the mid-19th to the early-20th century, commonly used to produce illustrations in children's books, serial [[pulp magazine]]s, and [[cover art]] for [[yellow-back]] and [[penny dreadful]]s.&lt;ref name="Ray, p. 64"&gt;Ray, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;  The art of [[Wood engraving|relief engraving]] and chromoxylography was perfected by engravers and printers in the 19th century, most notably in [[Victorian Era|Victorian]] London by engraver and printer [[Edmund Evans]] who was particularly good with the process, producing a wide range of [[hue]]s and [[Lightness (color)|tones]] through [[color mixing]]. Chromoxylography was a complicated technique, requiring intricate engraving and [[Relief print|printing]] for the best results. Less expensive products, such as covers for [[pulp magazines]], had to be produced with few colours, often only two or three, whereas more intricate and expensive books and reproductions of paintings used as many as a dozen or more colors. For each colour used, a separate woodblock had to be carved of the image being reproduced.

==Background==
Full-colour printing in the 19th century relied on the [[Relief printing|relief]] process and colour [[Relief carving|wood engraving]]. [[Bamber Gascoigne]] explains that the "vast majority of colour wood engravings are reproductive work of the second half of the nineteenth century, at which time they were often referred to as chromoxylographs—meaning colour from wood, just as [[chromolithograph]] means colour from stone."&lt;ref&gt;Gascoigne, section 23. a&lt;/ref&gt; [[Relief print]]s were made by printing with engraved and coloured wood blocks.&lt;ref name= "PennyNovels"/&gt;  In the 1830s, [[George Baxter (printer)|George Baxter]] repopularized colour relief printing, then called chromoxylography,&lt;!-- check this; unclear --&gt; using a "background detail plate printed in [[aquatint]] [[intaglio printing|intaglio]], followed by colours printed in oil inks from relief plates—usually wood blocks".&lt;ref name="Pankow, p. 22"&gt;Pankow, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromoxylography became a popular technique in the production of inexpensive books, such as children's [[toy book]]s and serialized stories into the early-20th century.&lt;ref name="Fraser and Banks, p. 59"&gt;Fraser and Banks, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The process was used simplistically in the mid-19th century to produce covers and illustrations for dime novels, penny dreadfuls, and children's books that were usually rendered, often ineffectively, only in [[primary colour]]s, using one colour per wood block.&lt;ref&gt;University of Stanford&lt;/ref&gt;  The process became much more elaborate with [[Edmund Evans]] work, London's premier engraver and printer of children's books,  as he perfected the process, often using as many as ten colour blocks, mixing and combining primary colours to create a broad palette of colours and hues.&lt;ref name= "PennyNovels"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pankow, p. 22"/&gt;

==Methods and uses==
[[File:Greenaway 1884 Almanack frontispiece.png|left|thumb|The frontispiece of 1887 Almanack, illustrated by [[Kate Greenaway]], shows distinct cross-hatchings in the umbrella for a lighter tone of black.]]
To make a relief print, the printer began with a wood block, engraved the image on the block by carving out areas that were not to be printed (or inked).&lt;ref name ="Gasgoigne53"&gt;Gasgoigne, section 53.f&lt;/ref&gt; A wood block was carved for each primary colours, with the coloured ink coating the areas left in relief.&lt;ref name="Fraser and Banks, p. 59"/&gt; Gascoigne explains that the process required a "master craftsman [to sit] with an original painting in front of him and work out which areas of the image should be printed in which of the available colours to achieve the desired effect."&lt;ref&gt;Gascoigne, section 23.b.&lt;/ref&gt; The printer engraved the image to the finer end grain of the woodblock.&lt;ref name ="Gascoigne23"&gt;Gascoigne, section 23.b&lt;/ref&gt; For more complicated work the carver worked on the end grain of the wood, and with the use of fine hatchings to the wood that were inked separately achieved the look of blended colours. For the children's book market, which had lower profit margins, the printer would use fewer ink colours, which could be optimised by mixing colours such as blue and yellow to create green.&lt;ref name ="Gascoigne53"&gt;Gascoigne, section 53.f&lt;/ref&gt;

The blocks were skillfully carved with extremely fine lines to create [[stipple|stippling]] and variations in tone.&lt;ref name ="Gasgoigne53"/&gt;  Areas intended to be printed in a solid colour were marked, and then hatching lines of various thickness were carved into the wood so that colours could be [[overprinted]], creating a variety of [[hue]]s and [[Lightness (color)|tones]].  To create a blend of colours, blocks were hatched horizontally and diagonally to allow applications of multiple colours that resulted in browns, greens and greys.&lt;ref&gt;Gascoigne, section 23.c&lt;/ref&gt;  Gascoigne explains that a "blockmaker would know whether to engrave thin white lines (for an almost solid tone), medium white lines (a mid-tone) or crosshatchings (leaving larger or smaller lozenges of colour to achieve sometimes little more than a faint tint when seen at a normal viewing distance)." Overlapping diagonal lines were carved to create dot-like shapes on the surface that took less ink and resulted in paler tones.&lt;ref name ="Gasgoigne53"/&gt;

[[File:Evans owls.png|thumb|Chromoxylograph of owls, printed in a nature book,  illustrated by [[Johann Zwecker]], engraved by the [[Brothers Dalziel|Dalziel brothers]], printed by [[Edmund Evans]]]]
Thicker hatchings were less expensive and easier to produce, but the result was not as attractive. Books that were to be produced as inexpensively as possible showed less engraving work and colour separation.&lt;ref name= "PennyNovels"/&gt; The chief problem was to maintain correct register so that the design on the block matched the design on the paper. To achieve a precise register small holes were drilled along each block, and the paper was pinned to it. When done correctly, the block's colour registers matched printed paper, although sometimes ink squash is visible along the edges of an illustration.&lt;ref name ="Gasgoigne68"&gt;Gascoigne, section 68&lt;/ref&gt; An [[electroplate]] was produced for each engraved wood block,  inked according to the block, thereby tinting the paper in specified areas. The colour was applied as a solid, or in stripes of various of thickness, allowing for changes in hue.&lt;ref name= "PennyNovels"/&gt;

According to Gascoigne, 19th century chromoxylographs are identified by embossing on the back of the paper, distinctly delineated outlines, created by pressing the paper against the engraved blocks, and the presence of crosshatchings. He writes that "an impossibly and perfect and delicate area of crosshatching will suggest at first that the graver could not possibly have scooped out such small and regular interstices, but on closer inspection the lines in the two directions will be found to be of slightly different colours."&lt;ref&gt;Gascoigne, section 55.s&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crane's Absurd ABC.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Walter Crane]]'s ''Absurd ABC'' double-spread with deep black background]]
Because the process was inexpensive, and commonly used to illustrate covers of inexpensive books such as mysteries and romances ("yellow backs" or "[[dime store novels]]") or magazines, and in rare instances, newspaper covers, complicated colour combinations generally were not necessary. Most often the printer only used primary colors and black.&lt;ref name= "PennyNovels"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/dp/pennies/print.html |title=Penny Novels and Penny Dreadfuls |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Stanford University Library |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inexpensive technique of chromoxylography allowed publishers and printers to design covers as an attraction to purchase the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/collections/early/victorian/penny-d/penny7.html "Aspects of the Victoria Book:Penny Dreadfuls".] British Library. Retrieved October 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The process was also used to produce higher quality children's books and [[toy book]]s. Evans considered full colour printing a technique well-suited to the simple illustrations in children's books.&lt;ref name=UDel/&gt; Evans reacted against crudely coloured children's book illustrations, which he believed could be beautiful and inexpensive if the print run was large enough to maintain the costs. In doing so, Evans collaborated with Walter Crane, Kate Greenaway and Randolph Caldecott.&lt;ref name=UMiss&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.usm.edu/~degrum/html/research/findaids/caldecot.htm |title=Randolph Caldecott Papers |work=de Grummond Collection |publisher=University of Southern Mississippi |accessdate=2010-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607003204/http://www.lib.usm.edu/~degrum/html/research/findaids/caldecot.htm |archivedate=2010-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Books illustrated by [[Kate Greenaway]], [[Walter Crane]] and [[Randolph Caldecott]], engraved and printed by Evans, became popular and remain as classic examples of illustrations for children's literature.&lt;ref name=UDel&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/exhibits/color/reliefs.htm |title=Color Printing in the Nineteenth Century |work= |publisher=University of Delaware Library |accessdate=2010-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromoxylography was additionally used to illustrate natural history books and to reproduce paintings. To achieve realistic reproductions an engraver often used 12 or more colour blocks.&lt;ref&gt;Gascoigne, section 23.d&lt;/ref&gt;

The area known as DUMBO used to be known as Gairville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= David W. |last= Dunlap| title= SoHo, TriBeCa And Now Dumbo? |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/25/realestate/soho-tribeca-and-now-dumbo.html |work= New York Times |date=October 25, 1998 | accessdate=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It encompasses two sections: one located between the [[Manhattan Bridge|Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn Bridge]]s, which connect Brooklyn to [[Manhattan]] across the [[East River]], and another that continues east from the Manhattan Bridge to the [[Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn|Vinegar Hill]] area. The neighborhood is bounded by [[Brooklyn Bridge Park]] to the north, the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] to the west, [[Brooklyn Heights]] to the south and Vinegar Hill to the east. Dumbo is part of [[Brooklyn Community Board 2]].

The area was originally a [[ferry]] landing, characterized by 19th- and early 20th-century industrial and warehouse buildings, [[Sett (paving)|Belgian block]] streets, and its location on the East River by the imposing anchorage of the Manhattan Bridge. The entirety of Dumbo was bought by developer [[David Walentas]] and his company Two Trees Management in the late 20th century, and remade into an upscale residential and commercial community—first becoming a haven for art [[Art museum|galleries]], and currently a center for technology [[Startup company|startups]].

The large community of tech startups earned DUMBO the nickname of "the center of the Brooklyn Tech Triangle". In that time, Dumbo had become Brooklyn's most expensive neighborhood, as well as New York City's fourth-richest community overall; this is owing in part to its large concentration of technology [[Startup company|startups]], its close proximity to Manhattan, and its large number of former industrial buildings that have been converted into spacious [[luxury real estate|luxury]] residential [[lofts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Nonko | first=Emily | title=The 8 Most Expensive Neighborhoods in New York City | website=New York.com | date=January 27, 2015 | url=http://www.newyork.com/articles/real-estate/the-most-expensive-neighborhoods-in-new-york-city-75971 | accessdate=November 7, 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029075613/http://www.newyork.com/articles/real-estate/the-most-expensive-neighborhoods-in-new-york-city-75971/ | archivedate=October 29, 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood is the corporate headquarters for e-commerce retailer [[Etsy]] and home furnishing stores company [[West Elm]].

The name is an [[acronym]] of "Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass". Several other New York City neighborhoods are known by [[portmanteau]]s, including [[Tribeca]], [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]], [[NoHo, Manhattan|NoHo]], [[NoMad]], and [[Nolita]] in Manhattan, and [[BoCoCa]] in Brooklyn.&lt;ref name="dolkart"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Dolkart |first1=Andrew S. |url=http://home2.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/DUMBO_Designation_Report.pdf |title=DUMBO Historic District Designation Report |publisher=[[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] |date=December 18, 2007 |accessdate=September 6, 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt2007-12-25"/&gt;

==History==
The area has been known variously as Rapailie, Olympia, and Walentasville.&lt;ref name="DumboNYC"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Dumbo |url=http://dumbonyc.com/about |work=Dumbo NYC, Brooklyn |publisher=DumboNYC.com |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Olympia" name came from [[Comfort Sands|Comfort]] and [[Joshua Sands (politician)|Joshua Sands]], who bought the land in 1787&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Olympia Settlement in Early Brooklyn|last = |first = |publisher = |year = 1929|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were planning to develop the land as a summer place for New Yorkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dictionary of American Biography|last = Johnson|first = Allen|publisher = Charles Scribner’s Sons|year = 1964|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 341–342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 18th and 19th centuries, the area now known as Dumbo was considered part of [[Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn|Vinegar Hill]].&lt;ref name="HISTORICAL DISTRICTS 1966"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1966|title=HISTORICAL DISTRICTS|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20780654|journal=Real Property, Probate and Trust Journal|volume=1|issue=3|pages=204–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1890s, the western portion of the neighborhood was known as [[Fulton Landing]], after the [[ferry]] stop that connected it to Manhattan before the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] opened. At that time, it was primarily a manufacturing district, with warehouses and factories that made machinery, paper boxes and [[Brillo]] soap pads. The area has been known variously as Rapailie, Olympia, and Walentasville.&lt;ref name="DumboNYC"/&gt; The [[cardboard box]] was invented in the Robert Gair building on Washington Street by Robert Gair, a Scottish emigrant; because of Gair's fame, the area was known as Gairsville for a long time.&lt;ref name="DumboNYC"/&gt; The Gair building is now home to [[Etsy]].&lt;ref name="usa"/&gt;&gt;

The [[Jay Street Connecting Railroad]] ran through Dumbo's waterfront from circa 1904–1906 through 1957. It ran from rail yards beneath the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges to buildings near the waterfront in Dumbo and Vinegar Hill. At the height of operations, it had spurs into several buildings, a [[car float bridge]] on Bridge Street, and a yard with capacity of 120 cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jay Street Terminal / Jay Street Connecting Railroad | website=TrainWeb.org | date=November 30, 2017 | url=http://members.trainweb.com/bedt/indloco/jst.html | access-date=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYPress-JSC-2003&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypress.com/the-jay-street-connecting-railroad/|title=The Jay Street Connecting Railroad|first=William|last=Bryk|date=April 22, 2003|work=NY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tracks were abandoned in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=RAIL LINE TO END ITS BROOKLYN RUN; Jay Street Connecting Road Allowed to Discontinue Operations in Harbor | website=The New York Times | date=April 16, 1959 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/04/16/archives/rail-line-to-end-its-brooklyn-run-jay-street-connecting-road.html | access-date=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the railroad's tracks are still visible on streets in Dumbo.&lt;ref name=NYPress-JSC-2003/&gt;

With the [[deindustrialization]] of New York City, Dumbo began to become primarily residential; artists and other young homesteaders seeking relatively large and inexpensive [[loft apartment]] spaces for studios and homes began moving there in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="nyt2007-12-25"/&gt; The acronym "Dumbo" arose in 1978, when new residents coined it in the belief such an unattractive name would help deter developers.&lt;ref name="nyt2007-12-25"/&gt;

Near the end of the 20th century, as property became more and more expensive in Manhattan, Dumbo became increasingly [[gentrification|gentrified]]. Even so, the acronym 'Dumbo' was largely unknown as late as 1997, and the area itself was very inclusive, serving mainly as an enclave for artists located along the [[East River]] and under the [[Manhattan Bridge]]. At this stage there were still many air conditioner repair shops, auto shops, and "seedy back alleys and wharves"; and, because the neighborhood was still gentrifying from its industrial past, it lacked even a bookstore, coffee shop, or [[Self-service laundry|laundromat]].&lt;ref name="nyt 19971010"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3DC153CF933A25753C1A961958260&amp;pagewanted=all "As It Turns Artistic, A Noirish Enclave Steps Into the Light"].

The DUMBO Historic District, a historic industrial complex and national [[Historic district (United States)|historic district]] in Dumbo, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; It consists of 95 contributing buildings; the manufacturing concerns located in this district included [[Benjamin Moore &amp; Co.]] (paint), Arbuckle Brothers (coffee and sugar), J.W.

'''Dysgeusia''', also known as '''parageusia''', is a distortion of the sense of taste. Dysgeusia is also often associated with [[ageusia]], which is the complete lack of taste, and [[hypogeusia]], which is a decrease in taste sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel K. Feske and Martin A. Samuels, ''Office Practice of Neurology'' 2nd ed. (Philadelphia: Elsevier Science, 2003) 114.&lt;/ref&gt; An alteration in taste or smell may be a secondary process in various disease states, or it may be the primary [[symptom]]. The distortion in the sense of taste is the only symptom, and [[diagnosis]] is usually complicated since the sense of taste is tied together with other [[sensory systems]]. Common causes of dysgeusia include chemotherapy, asthma treatment with albuterol, and zinc deficiency. Different drugs could also be responsible for altering taste and resulting in dysgeusia. Due to the variety of causes of dysgeusia, there are many possible treatments that are effective in alleviating or terminating the symptoms of dysgeusia. These include artificial saliva, pilocarpine, zinc supplementation, alterations in drug therapy, and alpha lipoic acid.

==Symptoms==

The alterations in the sense of [[taste]], usually a metallic taste, and sometimes [[Olfaction|smell]] are the only symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=HJ|last2=Ishii|first2=EK|last3=MacTurk|first3=RH|title=Age-related changes in the prevalence of smell/taste problems among the United States adult population. Results of the 1994 disability supplement to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=30 November 1998|volume=855|pages=716–22|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb10650.x|pmid=9929676|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1230764|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duration of the symptoms of dysgeusia depends on the cause. If the alteration in the sense of taste is due to [[gum disease]], [[dental plaque]], a temporary medication, or a short-term condition such as a [[Common cold|cold]], the dysgeusia should disappear once the cause is removed. In some cases, if [[lesions]] are present in the taste pathway and nerves have been damaged, the dysgeusia may be permanent.

==Causes==

===Chemotherapy===

A major cause of dysgeusia is [[chemotherapy]] for cancer. Chemotherapy often induces damage to the oral cavity, resulting in [[oral mucositis]], oral infection, and salivary gland dysfunction. Oral mucositis consists of [[inflammation]] of the mouth, along with sores and [[mouth ulcer|ulcers]] in the tissues.&lt;ref name=Judith&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raber-Durlacher|first1=Judith E.|last2=Barasch|first2=Andrei|last3=Peterson|first3=Douglas E.|last4=Lalla|first4=Rajesh V.|last5=Schubert|first5=Mark M.|last6=Fibbe|first6=Willem E.|title=Oral Complications and Management Considerations in Patients Treated with High-Dose Chemotherapy|journal=Supportive Cancer Therapy|date=July 2004|volume=1|issue=4|pages=219–229|doi=10.3816/SCT.2004.n.014|pmid=18628146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Healthy individuals normally have a diverse range of microbial [[organisms]] residing in their oral cavities; however, chemotherapy can permit these typically non-[[pathogenic]] agents to cause serious infection, which may result in a decrease in [[saliva]]. In addition, patients who undergo [[radiation therapy]] also lose salivary tissues.&lt;ref name="pmid16772071"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiseman|first1=Michael|title=The treatment of oral problems in the palliative patient|journal=Journal (Canadian Dental Association)|date=June 2006|volume=72|issue=5|pages=453–8|pmid=16772071}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saliva is an important component of the taste mechanism. Saliva both interacts with and protects the taste receptors in the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Matsuo R | year = 2000| title = Role of saliva in the maintenance of taste sensitivity | doi = 10.1177/10454411000110020501 | journal = Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. | volume =  11| issue = 2| pages = 216–29| pmid=12002816}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saliva mediates sour and sweet tastes through bicarbonate ions and glutamate, respectively.&lt;ref name=Speilman&gt;{{cite journal | author = Speilman A. L. | year = 1990| title = Interaction of Saliva and Taste | doi = 10.1177/00220345900690030101 | pmid = 2182682| journal = J Dent Res | volume =  69| issue = 3| pages = 838–843}}&lt;/ref&gt; The salt taste is induced when sodium chloride levels surpass the concentration in the saliva.&lt;ref name=Speilman /&gt; It has been reported that 50% of chemotherapy patients have suffered from either dysgeusia or another form of taste impairment.&lt;ref name=Judith /&gt; Examples of chemotherapy treatments that can lead to dysgeusia are [[cyclophosphamide]], [[cisplatin]], and [[etoposide]].&lt;ref name=Judith /&gt; The exact mechanism of chemotherapy-induced dysgeusia is unknown.&lt;ref name=Judith /&gt;

===Taste buds===

Distortions in the [[taste buds]] may give rise to dysgeusia. In a study conducted by Masahide Yasuda and Hitoshi Tomita from Nihon University of Japan, it has been observed that patients suffering from this taste disorder have fewer microvilli than normal. In addition, the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[cytoplasm]] of the taste bud cells have been reduced. Based on their findings, dygeusia results from loss of [[microvilli]] and the reduction of Type III intracellular vesicles, all of which could potentially interfere with the gustatory pathway.  Radiation to head and neck also results in direct destruction of taste buds, apart from effects of altered salivary output.&lt;ref name=Masahide /&gt;

===Zinc deficiency===

Another primary cause of dysgeusia is [[zinc]] deficiency. While the exact role of zinc in dysgeusia is unknown, it has been cited that zinc is partly responsible for the repair and production of taste buds. Zinc somehow directly or indirectly interacts with [[carbonic anhydrase VI]], influencing the concentration of gustin, which is linked to the production of taste buds.&lt;ref name=Heckman/&gt; It has also been reported that patients treated with zinc experience an elevation in [[calcium]] concentration in the saliva.&lt;ref name=Heckman /&gt; In order to work properly, taste buds rely on calcium receptors.&lt;ref name=Joseph&gt;Joseph M. Bicknell, MD and Robert V. Wiggins, MD, “Taste Disorder From Zinc Deficiency After Tonsillectomy,” ''The Western Journal of Medicine'' Oct.1988: 458.&lt;/ref&gt; Zinc “is an important cofactor for [[alkaline phosphatase]], the most abundant [[enzyme]] in taste bud membranes; it is also a component of a parotid salivary protein important to the development and maintenance of normal taste buds.”&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt;

===Drugs===

There are also a wide variety of drugs that can trigger dysgeusia, including [[zopiclone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sanofi-Aventis Australia Pty Limited|title=Product Information IMOVANE (zopiclone) Tablets|url=http://www.sanofi.com.au/products/aus_pi_imovane.pdf|accessdate=9 November 2014|location=ADVERSE EFFECTS|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-[[antihistamines]], such as [[azelastine]] and [[emedastine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simons|first1=F. Estelle R.|title=Advances in H1-Antihistamines|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=18 November 2004|volume=351|issue=21|pages=2203–2217|doi=10.1056/NEJMra033121|pmid=15548781}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 250 drugs affect taste.&lt;ref name=Samuel&gt;Samuel K. Feske and Martin A. Samuels, ''Office Practice of Neurology'' 2nd ed. (Philadelphia: Elsevier Science, 2003) 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sodium]] channels linked to taste receptors can be inhibited by [[amiloride]], and the creation of new taste buds and saliva can be impeded by [[antiproliferative]] drugs.&lt;ref name=Samuel /&gt; Saliva can have traces of the drug, giving rise to a metallic flavor in the mouth; examples include [[lithium carbonate]] and [[tetracyclines]].&lt;ref name=Samuel /&gt; Drugs containing [[sulfhydryl]] groups, including [[penicillamine]] and [[captopril]], may react with zinc and cause deficiency.&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt; [[Metronidazole]] and [[chlorhexidine]] have been found to interact with metal ions that associate with the [[cell membrane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ciancio|first1=Sebastian G.|title=Medications' impact on oral health|journal=Journal of the American Dental Association|date=October 2004|volume=135|issue=10|pages=1440–8; quiz 1468–9|pmid=15551986|doi=10.14219/jada.archive.2004.0055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs that prevent the production of [[angiotensin II]] by inhibiting [[angiotensin converting enzyme]], [[eprosartan]] for example, have been linked to dysgeusia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Castells|first1=X.|title=Drug points: Dysgeusia and burning mouth syndrome by eprosartan|journal=BMJ|date=30 November 2002|volume=325|issue=7375|pages=1277|doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7375.1277|pmid=12458247|pmc=136926}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are few case reports claiming calcium channel blockers like [[Amlodipine]] also cause dysguesia by blocking calcium sensitive taste buds.&lt;ref&gt;Pugazhenthan Thangaraju, Harmanjith Singh, Prince Kumar and Balasubramani Hariharan,"Is Dysguesia going to be a rare or a common side-effect of Amlodipine?,"''Ann Med Health Sci Res,''Mar-Apr 2014: {{PMC|4083725}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miscellaneous causes===
[[Xerostomia]], also known as dry mouth syndrome, can precipitate dysgeusia because normal salivary flow and concentration are necessary for taste. Injury to the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] can result in dysgeusia. In addition, damage done to the [[pons]], [[thalamus]], and [[midbrain]], all of which compose the gustatory pathway, can be potential factors.&lt;ref name=RK&gt;R. K. Mal and M. A. Birchall, “Dysgeusia related to urinary obstruction from benign prostatic disease: a case control and qualitative study,” ''European Archives of Oto-Rhino Laryngology'' 24 Aug. 2005:178.&lt;/ref&gt; In a case study, 22% of patients who were experiencing a bladder obstruction were also suffering from dysgeusia. Dysgeusia was eliminated in 100% of these patients once the obstruction was removed.&lt;ref name=RK /&gt; Although it is uncertain what the relationship between bladder relief and dysgeusia entails, it has been observed that the areas responsible for [[urinary system]] and taste in the pons and [[cerebral cortex]] in the brain are close in proximity.&lt;ref name=RK /&gt;

Many of the causes for dysgeusia occur due to unknown reasons. A wide range of miscellaneous factors may contribute to this taste disorder, such as [[gastric reflux]], [[lead poisoning]], and [[diabetes mellitus]].&lt;ref name=Norman&gt;Norman M. Mann, MD, “Management of Smell and Taste Problems,” ''Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine'' Apr. 2002: 334.&lt;/ref&gt; A minority of [[pine nut]]s can apparently cause taste disturbances, for reasons which are not entirely proven. Certain pesticides can have damaging effects on the taste buds and nerves in the mouth. These [[pesticides]] include [[organochloride]] compounds and [[carbamate]] pesticides. Damage to the [[peripheral nerves]], along with injury to the [[chorda tympani]] branch of the facial nerve, also cause dysgeusia.&lt;ref name=Norman /&gt; A surgical risk for [[laryngoscopy]] and [[tonsillectomy]] include dysgeusia.&lt;ref name=Norman /&gt; Patients who suffer from the [[burning mouth syndrome]], most likely [[menopausal]] women, are often suffering from dysgeusia as well.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Lauria, Alessandra Majorana, Monica borgna, Raffaella Lombardi, Paola Penza, Alessandro padovani, and Pierluigi Sapelli, “Trigeminal small-fiber sensory neuropathy causes burning mouth syndrome,” ''Pain'' 11 Mar. 2005: 332, 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Normal function===

The sense of taste is based on the detection of chemicals by specialized taste cells in the mouth. The mouth, throat, larynx, and esophagus all have [[taste buds]], which are replaced every ten days. Each taste bud contains receptor cells.&lt;ref name=Norman /&gt; Afferent nerves make contact with the receptor cells at the base of the taste bud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brand|first1=Joseph G|title=Within reach of an end to unnecessary bitterness?|journal=The Lancet|date=October 2000|volume=356|issue=9239|pages=1371–1372|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02836-1|pmid=11052575}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single taste bud is innervated by several afferent nerves, while a single efferent fiber innervates several taste buds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beidler|first1=L. M.|title=Renewal of cells within taste buds|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=1 November 1965|volume=27|issue=2|pages=263–272|doi=10.1083/jcb.27.2.263|citeseerx=10.1.1.281.8593}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fungiform papillae]] are present on the anterior portion of the tongue while [[circumvallate papillae]] and [[foliate papillae]] are found on the posterior portion of the tongue. The [[salivary glands]] are responsible for keeping the taste buds moist with saliva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bromley|first1=SM|title=Smell and taste disorders: a primary care approach|journal=American Family Physician|date=15 January 2000|volume=61|issue=2|pages=427–36, 438|pmid=10670508|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0115/p427.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A single taste bud is composed of four different types of cells, and each taste bud has at least 30 to 80 cells. Type I cells are thinly shaped, usually in the periphery of other cells. They also contain high amounts of [[chromatin]]. Type II cells have prominent [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] and nucleoli with much less chromatin than Type I cells. Type III cells have multiple [[mitochondria]] and large [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]]. Type I, II, and III cells also contain [[synapses]]. Type IV cells are normally rooted at the posterior end of the taste bud. Every cell in the taste bud forms [[microvilli]] at the ends.&lt;ref name=Masahide&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yasuda|first1=Masahide|last2=Tomita|first2=Hitoshi|title=Electron Microscopic Observations of Glossal Circumvallate Papillae in Dysgeusic Patients|journal=Acta Oto-Laryngologica|date=8 July 2009|volume=122|issue=4|pages=122–128|doi=10.1080/00016480260046508}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In humans, the sense of taste is conveyed via three of the twelve [[cranial nerves]]. The [[chorda tympani]] is responsible for taste sensations from the anterior two thirds of the tongue, the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] (IX) is responsible for taste sensations from the posterior one third of the tongue while a branch of the [[vagus nerve]] (X) carries some taste sensations from the back of the [[oral cavity]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Diagnosis==
In general, [[gustatory]] disorders are challenging to diagnose and evaluate. Because gustatory functions are tied to the sense of [[Olfaction|smell]], the [[somatosensory system]], and the perception of [[pain]] (such as in tasting spicy foods), it is difficult to examine sensations mediated through an individual system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deems|first1=DA|last2=Doty|first2=RL|last3=Settle|first3=RG|last4=Moore-Gillon|first4=V|last5=Shaman|first5=P|last6=Mester|first6=AF|last7=Kimmelman|first7=CP|last8=Brightman|first8=VJ|last9=Snow JB|first9=Jr|title=Smell and taste disorders, a study of 750 patients from the University of Pennsylvania Smell and Taste Center|journal=Archives of Otolaryngology--head &amp; Neck Surgery|date=1 May 1991|volume=117|issue=5|pages=519–28|doi=10.1001/archotol.1991.01870170065015|pmid=2021470}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, gustatory dysfunction is rare when compared to [[olfactory]] disorders.&lt;ref name=Hummel&gt;Hummel T, Knecht M. Smell and taste disorders. In: Calhoun KH, ed. Expert Guide to Otolaryngology. Philadelphia, Pa: American College of Physicians; 2001:650-664.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagnosis of dysgeusia begins with the patient being questioned about [[salivation]], swallowing, chewing, oral pain, previous [[ear infections]] (possibly indicated by hearing or balance problems), [[oral hygiene]], and stomach problems.&lt;ref name=Schiffman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epstein|first1=Franklin H.|last2=Schiffman|first2=Susan S.|title=Taste and Smell in Disease|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=26 May 1983|volume=308|issue=21|pages=1275–1279|doi=10.1056/NEJM198305263082107|pmid=6341841}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial history assessment also considers the possibility of accompanying diseases such as [[diabetes mellitus]], [[hypothyroidism]], or [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=Schiffman /&gt; A clinical examination is conducted and includes an inspection of the tongue and the oral cavity. Furthermore, the [[ear canal]] is inspected, as lesions of the [[chorda tympani]] have a predilection for this site.&lt;ref name=Schiffman /&gt;

===Gustatory testing===

In order to further classify the extent of dysgeusia and clinically measure the sense of taste, gustatory testing may be performed. Gustatory testing is performed either as a whole-mouth procedure or as a regional test. In both techniques, natural or electrical stimuli can be used. In regional testing, 20 to 50 µL of liquid stimulus is presented to the [[anterior]] and [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] tongue using a pipette, soaked filter-paper disks, or cotton swabs.&lt;ref name=Hummel /&gt; In whole mouth testing, small quantities (2-10 mL) of solution are administered, and the patient is asked to swish the solution around in the mouth.&lt;ref name=Hummel /&gt;

[[Sensory threshold|Threshold]] tests for [[sucrose]] (sweet), [[citric acid]] (sour), [[sodium chloride]] (salty), and [[quinine]] or [[caffeine]] (bitter) are frequently performed with natural stimuli. One of the most frequently used techniques is the "three-drop test."&lt;ref name=Ahne&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahne|first1=Gabi|last2=Erras|first2=Angelo|last3=Hummel|first3=Thomas|last4=Kobal|first4=Gerd|title=Assessment of Gustatory Function by Means of Tasting Tablets|journal=The Laryngoscope|date=August 2000|volume=110|issue=8|pages=1396–1401|doi=10.1097/00005537-200008000-00033|pmid=10942148}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this test, three drops of liquid are presented to the subject. One of the drops is of the taste stimulus, and the other two drops are pure water.&lt;ref name=Ahne /&gt; Threshold is defined as the concentration at which the patient identifies the taste correctly three times in a row.&lt;ref name=Ahne /&gt;

Suprathreshold tests, which provide intensities of taste stimuli above threshold levels, are used to assess the patient's ability to differentiate between different intensities of taste and to estimate the magnitude of suprathreshold loss of taste. From these tests, ratings of pleasantness can be obtained using either the direct scaling or magnitude matching method and may be of value in the diagnosis of dysgeusia. Direct scaling tests show the ability to discriminate among different intensities of stimuli and whether a stimulus of one quality (sweet) is stronger or weaker than a stimulus of another quality (sour).&lt;ref name=Seiden&gt;Seiden, Allen M., “Taste and Smell Disorders (Rhinology &amp; Sinusology),” Thieme Publishing Group Aug. 2000: 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Direct scaling cannot be used to determine if a taste stimulus is being perceived at abnormal levels. In this case, magnitude matching is used, in which a patient is asked to rate the intensities of taste stimuli and stimuli of another [[sensory system]], such as the loudness of a tone, on a similar scale.&lt;ref name=Seiden /&gt; For example, the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center asks patients to rate the intensities of NaCl, sucrose, citric acid and quinine-HCl stimuli, and the loudness of 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz tones.&lt;ref name=Seiden /&gt; Assuming normal hearing, the results of this cross-sensory test show the relative strength of the sense of taste in relation to the loudness of the auditory stimulus. Although many of the tests are based on ratings using the direct scaling method, some tests do use the magnitude-matching procedure.

Other tests include identification or discrimination of common taste substances. [[Topical anesthesia]] of the tongue has been reported to be of use in the diagnosis of dysgeusia as well, since it has been shown to relieve the symptoms of dysgeusia temporarily.&lt;ref name=Hummel /&gt; In addition to techniques based on the administration of chemicals to the tongue, [[electrogustometry]] is frequently used. It is based on the induction of gustatory sensations by means of an anodal electrical [[direct current]]. Patients usually report sour or metallic sensations similar to those associated with touching both poles of a live battery to the tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stillman|first1=JA|last2=Morton|first2=RP|last3=Goldsmith|first3=D|title=Automated electrogustometry: a new paradigm for the estimation of taste detection thresholds|journal=Clinical Otolaryngology and Allied Sciences|date=April 2000|volume=25|issue=2|pages=120–5|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2273.2000.00328.x|pmid=10816215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although electrogustometry is widely used, there seems to be a poor correlation between electrically and chemically induced sensations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=Claire|last2=Quiñonez|first2=Carlo|last3=Nordin|first3=Steven|title=Reliability and Validity of Electrogustometry and its Application to Young and Elderly Persons|journal=Chemical Senses|date=1995|volume=20|issue=5|pages=499–503|doi=10.1093/chemse/20.5.499|pmid=8564424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diagnostic tools===

Certain diagnostic tools can also be used to help determine the extent of dysgeusia. [[Electrophysiology|Electrophysiological]] tests and simple reflex tests may be applied to identify abnormalities in the [[nerve]]-to-[[brainstem]] pathways. For example, the [[blink reflex]] may be used to evaluate the integrity of the [[trigeminal nerve]]–[[Pontine nuclei|pontine brainstem]]–[[facial nerve]] pathway, which may play a role in gustatory function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jääskeläinen|first1=Satu K|last2=Forssell|first2=Heli|last3=Tenovuo|first3=Olli|title=Abnormalities of the blink reflex in burning mouth syndrome|journal=Pain|date=December 1997|volume=73|issue=3|pages=455–460|doi=10.1016/S0304-3959(97)00140-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural imaging is routinely used to investigate [[lesions]] in the taste pathway. [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] allows direct visualization of the [[cranial nerves]].&lt;ref name=Lell&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lell|first1=M|last2=Schmid|first2=A|last3=Stemper|first3=B|last4=Maihöfner|first4=C|last5=Heckmann|first5=JG|last6=Tomandl|first6=BF|title=Simultaneous involvement of third and sixth cranial nerve in a patient with Lyme disease|journal=Neuroradiology|date=18 December 2002|volume=45|issue=2|pages=85–7|doi=10.1007/s00234-002-0904-x|pmid=12592489}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it provides significant information about the type and cause of a lesion.&lt;ref name=Lell /&gt; Analysis of [[mucous membranes|mucosal]] [[blood flow]] in the oral cavity in combination with the assessment of [[autonomous]] [[cardiovascular]] factors appears to be useful in the diagnosis of [[autonomic nervous system]] disorders in [[burning mouth syndrome]] and in patients with inborn disorders, both of which are associated with gustatory dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heckmann|first1=Josef G.|last2=Hilz|first2=Max J.|last3=Hummel|first3=Thomas|last4=Popp|first4=Michael|last5=Marthol|first5=Harald|last6=Neundörfer|first6=Bernhard|last7=Heckmann|first7=Siegfried M.|title=Oral mucosal blood flow following dry ice stimulation in humans|journal=Clinical Autonomic Research|date=October 2000|volume=10|issue=5|pages=317–321|doi=10.1007/BF02281116|pmid=11198489}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cell cultures]] may also be used when fungal or bacterial infections are suspected.

In addition, the analysis of [[saliva]] should be performed, as it constitutes the environment of [[taste|taste receptors]], including transport of tastes to the receptor and protection of the taste receptor.&lt;ref name=Matsuo&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matsuo|first1=R|title=Role of Saliva in the Maintenance of Taste Sensitivity|journal=Critical Reviews in Oral Biology &amp; Medicine|date=April 2000|volume=11|issue=2|pages=216–229|doi=10.1177/10454411000110020501|pmid=12002816}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical clinical investigations involve sialometry and sialochemistry.&lt;ref name=Matsuo /&gt; Studies have shown that [[micrograph|electron micrographs]] of taste receptors obtained from saliva samples indicate [[pathological]] changes in the taste buds of patients with dysgeusia and other gustatory disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henkin|first1=Robert I.|title=Idiopathic Hypogeusia With Dysgeusia, Hyposmia, and Dysosmia|journal=JAMA|date=26 July 1971|volume=217|issue=4|pages=434–40|doi=10.1001/jama.1971.03190040028006|pmid=5109029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatments==

===Artificial saliva and pilocarpine===

Because medications have been linked to approximately 22% to 28% of all cases of dysgeusia, researching a treatment for this particular cause has been important.&lt;ref name=Giudice&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giudice|first1=M.|title=Taste Disturbances Linked to Drug Use: Change in Drug Therapy May Resolve Symptoms|journal=Canadian Pharmacists Journal / Revue des Pharmaciens du Canada|date=1 March 2006|volume=139|issue=2|pages=70–73|doi=10.1177/171516350613900208}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xerostomia]], or a decrease in saliva flow, can be a side effect of many drugs, which, in turn, can lead to the development of taste disturbances such as dysgeusia.&lt;ref name=Giudice /&gt; Patients can lessen the effects of xerostomia with breath mints, sugarless gum, or lozenges, or physicians can increase saliva flow with artificial saliva or oral [[pilocarpine]].&lt;ref name=Giudice /&gt; Artificial saliva mimics the characteristics of natural saliva by lubricating and protecting the mouth but does not provide any digestive or enzymatic benefits.&lt;ref name=Preetha&gt;Preetha, A. and R. Banerjee, "Comparison of Artificial Saliva Substitutes, ''Trends in Biomaterials and Artificial Organs'', Jan. 2005: 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Pilocarpine is a [[cholinergic]] drug meaning it has the same effects as the [[neurotransmitter]] [[acetylcholine]]. Acetylcholine has the function of stimulating the [[salivary glands]] to actively produce saliva.&lt;ref name="Medications and Drugs"&gt;"Medications and Drugs," 6 May 2004, 25 Oct. 2009, &lt;http://www.medicinenet.com/pilocarpine/article.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in saliva flow is effective in improving the movement of tastants to the [[taste buds]].&lt;ref name=Giudice /&gt;

===Zinc deficiency===

====Zinc supplementation====

[[Image:Zinc gluconate.png|thumb|right|alt=Zinc Gluconate.|Zinc Gluconate.]]

Approximately one half of drug-related taste distortions are caused by a [[zinc deficiency]].&lt;ref name=Giudice /&gt; Many medications are known to [[chelate]], or bind, [[zinc]], preventing the element from functioning properly.&lt;ref name=Giudice /&gt; Due to the causal relationship of insufficient zinc levels to taste disorders, research has been conducted to test the efficacy of zinc supplementation as a possible treatment for dysgeusia. In a randomized clinical trial, fifty patients suffering from [[idiopathic]] dysgeusia were given either zinc or a lactose [[placebo]].&lt;ref name=Heckman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heckmann|first1=SM|last2=Hujoel|first2=P|last3=Habiger|first3=S|last4=Friess|first4=W|last5=Wichmann|first5=M|last6=Heckmann|first6=JG|last7=Hummel|first7=T|title=Zinc gluconate in the treatment of dysgeusia--a randomized clinical trial|journal=Journal of Dental Research|date=1 January 2005|volume=84|issue=1|pages=35–8|doi=10.1177/154405910508400105|pmid=15615872|url=https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-fau/files/2919/heckmann_zinc_4148.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patients prescribed the zinc reported experiencing improved taste function and less severe symptoms compared to the control group, suggesting that zinc may be a beneficial treatment.&lt;ref name=Heckman /&gt; The efficacy of zinc, however, has been ambiguous in the past. In a second study, 94% of patients who were provided with zinc supplementation did not experience any improvement in their condition.&lt;ref name=Giudice /&gt; This ambiguity is most likely due to small sample sizes and the wide range of causes of dysgeusia.&lt;ref name=Heckman /&gt; A recommended daily oral dose of 25–100&amp;nbsp;mg appears to be an effective treatment for taste dysfunction provided that there are low levels of zinc in the [[blood serum]].&lt;ref name=Heyneman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyneman|first1=Catherine A|title=Zinc Deficiency and Taste Disorders|journal=Annals of Pharmacotherapy|date=February 1996|volume=30|issue=2|pages=186–187|doi=10.1177/106002809603000215|pmid=8835055}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is not a sufficient amount of evidence to determine whether or not zinc supplementation is able to treat dysgeusia when low zinc concentrations are not detected in the blood.&lt;ref name=Heyneman /&gt;

====Zinc infusion in chemotherapy====

It has been reported that approximately 68% of cancer patients undergoing [[chemotherapy]] experience disturbances in sensory perception such as dysgeusia.&lt;ref name=Hong&gt;Hong, Jae Hee, et al., "Taste and Odor Abnormalities in Cancer Patients," ''The Journal of Supportive Oncology'', Mar./Apr. 2009: 59-64.&lt;/ref&gt; In a pilot study involving twelve lung cancer patients, chemotherapy drugs were infused with zinc in order to test its potential as a treatment.&lt;ref name=Yamagata&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yamagata|first1=T|last2=Nakamura|first2=Y|last3=Yamagata|first3=Y|last4=Nakanishi|first4=M|last5=Matsunaga|first5=K|last6=Nakanishi|first6=H|last7=Nishimoto|first7=T|last8=Minakata|first8=Y|last9=Mune|first9=M|last10=Yukawa|first10=S|title=The pilot trial of the prevention of the increase in electrical taste thresholds by zinc containing fluid infusion during chemotherapy to treat primary lung cancer|journal=Journal of Experimental &amp; Clinical Cancer Research : CR|date=December 2003|volume=22|issue=4|pages=557–63|pmid=15053297}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results indicated that, after two weeks, no taste disturbances were reported by the patients who received the zinc-supplemented treatment while most of the patients in the control group who did not receive the zinc reported taste alterations.&lt;ref name=Yamagata /&gt; A multi-institutional study involving a larger sample size of 169 patients, however, indicated that zinc-infused chemotherapy did not have an effect on the development of taste disorders in cancer patients.&lt;ref name=Hong /&gt; An excess amount of zinc in the body can have negative effects on the [[immune system]], and physicians must use caution when administering zinc to [[immunocompromised]] cancer patients.&lt;ref name=Hong /&gt; Because taste disorders can have detrimental effects on a patient's quality of life, more research needs to be conducted concerning possible treatments such as zinc supplementation.&lt;ref name=Halyard&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halyard|first1=MY|title=Taste and smell alterations in cancer patients--real problems with few solutions|journal=The Journal of Supportive Oncology|date=2008|volume=7|issue=2|pages=68–9|pmid=19408460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Altering drug therapy===

[[Image:Eprosartan.svg|thumb|right|alt=Eprosartan.|[[Eprosartan]].]]

The effects of drug-related dysgeusia can often be reversed by stopping the patient's regimen of the taste altering medication.&lt;ref name=Bromley&gt;Bromley, Steven M., "Smell and Taste Disorders: A Primary Care Approach," American Family Physician 15 Jan. 2000, 23 Oct. 2009 &lt;http://www.aafp.org/afp/20000115/427.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, a forty-eight-year-old woman who was suffering from [[hypertension]] was being treated with [[valsartan]].&lt;ref name=Castells&gt;Castells, Xavier, et al., "Drug Points: Dysgeusia and Burning Mouth Syndrome by Eprosartan," ''British Medical Journal'', 30 Nov. 2002: 1277.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this drug's inability to treat her condition, she began taking a regimen of [[eprosartan]], an [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]].&lt;ref name=Castells /&gt; Within three weeks, she began experiencing a metallic taste and a burning sensation in her mouth that ceased when she stopped taking the medication.&lt;ref name=Castells /&gt; When she began taking eprosartan on a second occasion, her dysgeusia returned.&lt;ref name=Castells /&gt; In a second case, a fifty-nine-year-old man was prescribed [[amlodipine]] in order to treat his hypertension.&lt;ref name=Sadasivam&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadasivam|first1=Balakrishnan|last2=Jhaj|first2=Ratinder|title=Dysgeusia with amlodipine ? a case report|journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|date=February 2007|volume=63|issue=2|pages=253|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2006.02727.x|pmid=17274793|pmc=2000565}}&lt;/ref&gt; After eight years of taking the drug, he developed a loss of taste sensation and numbness in his tongue.&lt;ref name=Sadasivam /&gt; When he ran out of his medication, he decided not to obtain a refill and stopped taking amlodipine.&lt;ref name=Sadasivam /&gt; Following this self-removal, he reported experiencing a return of his taste sensation.&lt;ref name=Sadasivam /&gt; Once he refilled his prescription and began taking amlodipine a second time, his taste disturbance reoccurred.&lt;ref name=Sadasivam /&gt; These two cases suggest that there is an association between these drugs and taste disorders. This link is supported by the "de-challenge" and "re-challenge" that took place in both instances.&lt;ref name=Sadasivam /&gt; It appears that drug-induced dysgeusia can be alleviated by reducing the drug's dose or by substituting a second drug from the same class.&lt;ref name=Giudice /&gt;

===Alpha lipoic acid===

[[Image:AlphaLipoicAcid.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Alpha Lipoic Acid.|[[Alpha Lipoic Acid]].]]

[[Alpha lipoic acid]] (ALA) is an [[antioxidant]] that is made naturally by human cells.&lt;ref name=UMMC&gt;University of Maryland Medical Center, "Alpha-lipoic Acid," 26 Oct. 2009 &lt;http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/alpha-lipoic-000285.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be administered in capsules or can be found in foods such as red meat, organ meats, and yeast.&lt;ref name=UMMC /&gt; Like other antioxidants, it functions by ridding the body of harmful [[free radicals]] that can cause damage to tissues and organs.&lt;ref name=UMMC /&gt; It has an important role in the [[Krebs cycle]] as a [[coenzyme]] leading to the production of antioxidants, intracellular [[glutathione]], and nerve-growth factors.&lt;ref name=Femiano&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Femiano|first1=F|last2=Scully|first2=C|last3=Gombos|first3=F|title=Idiopathic dysgeusia; an open trial of alpha lipoic acid (ALA) therapy|journal=International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery|date=December 2002|volume=31|issue=6|pages=625–8|doi=10.1054/ijom.2002.0276|pmid=12521319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal research has also uncovered the ability of ALA to improve [[nerve conduction velocity]].&lt;ref name=Femiano /&gt; Because flavors are perceived by differences in [[electric potential]] through specific nerves innervating the tongue, idiopathic dysgeusia may be a form of a [[neuropathy]].&lt;ref name=Femiano /&gt; ALA has proven to be an effective treatment for [[burning mouth syndrome]] spurring studies in its potential to treat dysgeusia.&lt;ref name=Femiano /&gt; In a study of forty-four patients diagnosed with the disorder, one half was treated with the drug for two months while the other half, the control group, was given a placebo for two months followed by a two-month treatment of ALA.&lt;ref name=Femiano /&gt; The results reported show that 91% of the group initially treated with ALA reported an improvement in their condition compared to only 36% of the control group.&lt;ref name=Femiano /&gt; After the control group was treated with ALA, 72% reported an improvement.&lt;ref name=Femiano /&gt; This study suggests that ALA may be a potential treatment for patients and supports that full double blind randomized studies should be performed.&lt;ref name=Femiano /&gt;

===Managing dysgeusia===

In addition to the aforementioned treatments, there are also many management approaches that can alleviate the symptoms of dysgeusia. These include using non-metallic silverware, avoiding metallic or bitter tasting foods, increasing the consumption of foods high in protein, flavoring foods with spices and seasonings, serving foods cold in order to reduce any unpleasant taste or odor, frequently brushing one's teeth and utilizing mouthwash, or using [[sialogogue]]s such as chewing sugar-free gum or sour-tasting drops that stimulate the productivity of saliva.&lt;ref name=Hong /&gt; When taste is impeded, the food experience can be improved through means other than taste, such as texture, aroma, temperature, and color.&lt;ref name=Bromley /&gt;

===Psychological impacts===

People who suffer from dysgeusia are also forced to manage the impact that the disorder has on their quality of life. An altered taste has effects on food choice and intake and can lead to [[weight loss]], [[malnutrition]], impaired immunity, and a decline in health.&lt;ref name=Bromley /&gt; Patients diagnosed with dysgeusia must use caution when adding sugar and salt to food and must be sure not to overcompensate for their lack of taste with excess amounts.&lt;ref name=Bromley /&gt; Since the elderly are often on multiple medications, they are at risk for taste disturbances increasing the chances of developing [[Depression (mood)|depression]], loss of appetite, and extreme weight loss.&lt;ref name=Padala&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Padala|first1=Kalpana P.|last2=Hinners|first2=Cheryl K.|last3=Padala|first3=Prasad R.|title=Mirtazapine Therapy for Dysgeusia in an Elderly Patient|journal=The Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|date=14 July 2006|volume=08|issue=3|pages=178–180|doi=10.4088/PCC.v08n0310b|pmid=16912823|pmc=1540398}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is cause for an evaluation and management of their dysgeusia. In patients undergoing chemotherapy, taste distortions can often be severe and make compliance with cancer treatment difficult.&lt;ref name=Yamagata /&gt; Other problems that may arise include [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] and behavioral changes that can be misinterpreted as psychiatric delusions regarding food.&lt;ref name=Bicknell&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bicknell|first1=JM|last2=Wiggins|first2=RV|title=Taste disorder from zinc deficiency after tonsillectomy|journal=The Western Journal of Medicine|date=October 1988|volume=149|issue=4|pages=457–60|pmid=3227690|pmc=1026505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms including [[paranoia]], [[amnesia]], cerebellar malfunction, and [[lethargy]] can also manifest when undergoing [[histidine]] treatment.&lt;ref name=Bicknell /&gt; This makes it critical that these patients' dysgeusia is either treated or managed in order to improve their quality of life.

==Future research==

Every year, more than 200,000 individuals see their physicians concerning [[chemosensory]] problems, and many more taste disturbances are never reported.&lt;ref name=NIDOCD&gt;National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, "Taste Disorders," 25 June 2008, 23 Oct. 2009 &lt;http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/smelltaste/taste.asp&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the large number of persons affected by taste disorders, basic and clinical research are receiving support at different institutions and chemosensory research centers across the country.&lt;ref name=NIDOCD /&gt; These taste and smell clinics are focusing their research on better understanding the mechanisms involved in gustatory function and taste disorders such as dysgeusia. For example, the [[National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders]] is looking into the mechanisms underlying the key receptors on taste cells and applying this knowledge to the future of medications and artificial food products.&lt;ref name=NIDOCD /&gt; Meanwhile, the Taste and Smell Clinic at the [[University of Connecticut Health Center]] is integrating behavioral, neurophysiological, and genetic studies involving stimulus concentrations and intensities in order to better understand taste function.&lt;ref name=UCHC&gt;The University of Connecticut Health Center, "Taste and Smell: Research," 26 Oct. 2009 &lt;http://www.uchc.edu/uconntasteandsmell/research/index.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these studies is to unearth the biological mechanisms underlying taste and to use this data to eliminate taste disorders in order to improve the lives of taste disorder sufferers.

'''''Archduke Leopold Wilhelm and the artist in the archducal picture gallery in Brussels''''' is a 1651 painting of [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm]]'s Italian art collection by the [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] painter [[David Teniers the Younger]], now held in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bilddatenbank.khm.at/viewArtefact?id=1897 GG_739] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115542/http://bilddatenbank.khm.at/viewArtefact?id=1897 |date=2014-08-26 }} in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] collection&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting shows the Archduke as a collector with friends admiring a set of paintings. The artist himself holds his hat in his hand and is listening to his patron as the archduke gestures with his cane towards some recent acquisitions. The paintings are arranged in rows on a rear wall, with several others on the side of the vestibule on the left, and a set that are positioned in the foreground leaning against chairs for inspection.

This painting is a copy by the artist and one of the first that [[David Teniers the Younger]] prepared to document the Archduke's collection before he employed 12 engravers to publish his ''[[Theatrum Pictorium]]'', considered the "first illustrated art catalog". He published this book of engravings after the Archduke had moved to Austria and taken his collection with him. It was published in Antwerp in 1659 and again in 1673.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/gri_33125009347911 Online version] of the [[Theatrum Pictorium]], 1673&lt;/ref&gt; The original version of this painting, with the figures arranged differently, is in the collection of [[Petworth House]], south of London.

==Paintings depicted==
{{main|Gallery of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in Brussels (Petworth)}}
Most of the recognizable paintings in the collection, not all of which were included in the Italian catalog prepared by Teniers, are still in the Viennese collection. The full list of the depicted paintings is the same as the [[Gallery of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in Brussels (Petworth)|Petworth version]]. That version, which includes a portrait of Bishop Antonius Triest (1576-1657), served as the basis for this copy, though they are about the same size and were possibly both made at the same time in tandem.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/images/44376 record 44376] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; The bishop was an art collector and a patron of many of Teniers's contemporary artists in Antwerp, and introduced Teniers to the Archduke. This copy remained in the archducal collection, while several others were documented as gifts. The most impressive of these was the [[The Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in his Painting Gallery in Brussels|large version on copper]] in the [[Museo del Prado]] with a different selection of paintings.

[[File:Hortus Deliciarum, Der Tanz um das goldene Kalb.JPG|thumb|''[[The Adoration of the Golden Calf]]'' – Picture from the [[Hortus deliciarum]] of [[Herrad of Landsberg]] (12th century)]]
According to the [[Bible]], the '''golden calf''' (עֵגֶּל הַזָהָב '' ‘ēggel hazāhāv'') was an [[Idolatry|idol]] (a [[cult image]]) made by the [[Israelites]] during [[Moses]]' absence, when he went up to [[biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the incident is known as ''ḥēṭ’ ha‘ēggel'' (חֵטְא הַעֵגֶּל) or "The Sin of the Calf". It is first mentioned in {{bibleref2|Exodus|32:4}}.

[[Bull worship]] was common in many cultures. In Egypt, whence according to the [[The Exodus|Exodus narrative]] the Hebrews had recently come, the [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis Bull]] was a comparable object of worship, which some believe the Hebrews were reviving in the wilderness;&lt;ref&gt;The early Christian ''[[Apostolic Constitutions]]'', [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume VII/Constitutions of the Holy Apostles/Book VI/Sec. IV|vi. 4]] (c. 380), mentions that "the law is the decalogue, which the Lord promulgated to them with an audible voice, before the people made that calf which represented the Egyptian Apis."&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively, some believe the God of Israel was associated with or pictured as a calf/bull deity through the process of [[religious assimilation]] and [[syncretism]]. Among the Egyptians' and Hebrews' neighbors in the [[ancient Near East]] and in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], the [[aurochs]], the wild bull, was widely worshipped, often as the [[Bull (mythology)|Lunar Bull]] and as the creature of [[El (god)|El]].

==In the Book of Exodus==

[[File:The Worship of the Golden Calf (Filippino Lippi).jpg|thumb|right|''The Worship of the Golden Calf'' by [[Filippino Lippi]] (1457–1504)]]
When [[Moses]] went up into [[Biblical Mount Sinai]] to receive the [[Ten Commandments]] ({{bibleref|Exodus|24:12-18|9}}), he left the Israelites for [[forty days and forty nights]]. The Israelites feared that he would not return and demanded that [[Aaron]] make them "gods" to go before them ({{bibleref|Exodus|32:1|9}}). Aaron gathered up the Israelites' golden earrings and ornaments, constructed a "molten calf" and they declared: "These ''[be]'' thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt." (Exodus 32:4)

Aaron built an [[altar]] before the calf and proclaimed the next day to be a feast to the {{LORD}}. So they rose up early the next day and "offered [[Korban Olah|burnt-offerings]], and brought [[Slaughter offering|peace-offerings]]; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play." (Exodus 32:6) God told Moses what the Israelites were up to back in camp, that they had turned aside quickly out of the way which God commanded them and he was going to destroy them and start a new people from Moses. Moses besought and pleaded that they should be spared ({{bibleverse||Exodus|32:11-14|HE}}), and God "repented of the evil which He said He would do unto His people."

Moses went down from the mountain, but upon seeing the calf, he became angry and threw down the two [[Tablets of Stone]], breaking them. Moses burnt the golden calf in a fire, ground it to powder, scattered it on water, and forced the Israelites to drink it. When Moses asked him, Aaron admitted collecting the gold, and throwing it into the fire, and said it came out as a calf ({{bibleverse||Exodus|32:21-24|HE}}).

===Exclusion of the Levites and mass execution===
{{main|Levite}}
The Bible records that the [[tribe of Levi]] did not worship the golden calf. When Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said: 'Whosoever is on the {{LORD}}'s side, let him come unto me.' And all the [[Levite|sons of Levi]] gathered themselves together unto him. And he said unto them: 'Thus saith the {{LORD}}, the God of Israel: Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.' And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. ({{bibleverse||Exodus|32:26-28|HE}})

==Other mentions in the Bible==
[[File:Tissot Moses Destroys the Tables of the Ten Commandments.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Moses destroying the tables (watercolor circa 1896–1902 by [[James Tissot]])]]
The golden calf is mentioned in {{bibleref2|Nehemiah|9:16–21|NIV}}.
{{quote|
"But they, our ancestors, became arrogant and stiff-necked, and they did not obey your commands. They refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed among them. They became stiff-necked and in their rebellion appointed a leader in order to return to their slavery. But you are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love. Therefore you did not desert them, even when they cast for themselves an image of a calf and said, 'This is your god, who brought you up out of Egypt', or when they committed awful blasphemies. "Because of your great compassion you did not abandon them in the wilderness. By day the pillar of cloud did not fail to guide them on their path, nor the pillar of fire by night to shine on the way they were to take. You gave your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your manna from their mouths, and you gave them water for their thirst. For forty years you sustained them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing, their clothes did not wear out nor did their feet become swollen."}}

The language suggests that there are some inconsistencies in the other accounts of the Israelites and their use of the calf. As the version in Exodus and 1&amp;nbsp;Kings are written by [[Deuteronomist]]ic historians based in the southern kingdom of Judah, there is a proclivity to expose the Israelites as unfaithful. The inconsistency is primarily located in Exodus&amp;nbsp;32:4 where "gods" is plural despite the construction of a single calf. When Ezra retells the story, he uses the single, capitalized God.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, 2009, pg.&amp;nbsp;116–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, a more biblically conservative view offers a tenable explanation accounting for the discrepancy between "gods" in Exodus&amp;nbsp;32 and "God" in Nehemiah&amp;nbsp;9:18. In both instances, the Hebrew ''[[elohim]]'' is used.  Since ancient Hebrew failed to distinguish ''elohim'' God (known as the majestic plural) from ''elohim'' gods, Biblical translations are either determined by (a)&amp;nbsp;context or (b)&amp;nbsp;adjacent verb(s). In the original account in Exodus&amp;nbsp;32, the verb is in the 3rd&amp;nbsp;person plural. In Nehemiah&amp;nbsp;9, the verb connected to ''elohim'' is singular. For the JEDP (i.e. Deuteronomistic) theorist, this inconsistency is confirmatory since the theory maintains a roughly equivalent date for the composition of Exodus and Nehemiah. More conservative scholarship would argue that these two texts were composed about 1000&amp;nbsp;years apart: Exodus (by Moses) ''circa'' 1500&amp;nbsp;BCE, and Nehemiah ''circa'' 500&amp;nbsp;BCE. The biblically conservative framework would therefore account for the verbal inconsistency from Exodus to Nehemiah as an evolution in the use of language over the approximate millennium separating the two books.

==Jeroboam's golden calves at Bethel and Dan==
{{main|Jeroboam}}
[[Image:Worshiping the golden calf.jpg|thumb|right|Worshiping the Golden Calf]]
According to {{bibleref2|1 Kings|12:26–30|NIV}}, after [[Jeroboam]] establishes the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|northern Kingdom of Israel]], he contemplates the sacrificial practices of the Israelites.
{{quote|
Jeroboam thought to himself, "The kingdom will now likely revert to the house of David. If these people go up to offer sacrifices at the temple of the {{LORD}} in Jerusalem, they will again give their allegiance to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah. They will kill me and return to King Rehoboam." After seeking advice, the king made two golden calves. He said to the people, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt." One he set up in Bethel, and the other in [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]]. And this thing became a sin; the people came to worship the one at Bethel and went as far as Dan to worship the other.}}

His concern was that the tendency to offer sacrifices in Jerusalem, which is in the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]], would lead to a return to King [[Rehoboam]]. He makes two golden calves and places them in [[Bethel]] and [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]]. He erects the two calves in what he figures (in some interpretations) as substitutes for the ''[[cherub]]im'' built by [[King Solomon]] in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, pg. 117, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Elliott Friedman]] says "at a minimum we can say that the writer of the golden calf account in Exodus seems to have taken the words that were traditionally ascribed to Jeroboam and placed them in the mouths of the people." Friedman believes that the story was turned into a [[polemic]], exaggerating the throne platform decoration into idolatry, by a family of priests sidelined by Jeroboam.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott "Who Wrote the Bible?" 1987 pp 72–3&lt;/ref&gt;

The declarations of Aaron and Jeroboam are almost identical: 
* 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt' (Exod 32:4, 8);
* 'Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt (1 Kings 12:28)
After making the golden calf or golden calves both Aaron and Jeroboam celebrate festivals. Aaron builds an altar and Jeroboam ascends an altar (Exod 32:5–6; 1 Kings 12:32–33).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harvey|first1=John E.|title=Retelling the Torah: the Deuteronomistic historian's use of Tetrateuchal Narratives|date=2004|publisher=T &amp; T Clark International|location=New York; London|page=2|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/retelling-the-torah-the-deuteronomistic-historians-use-of-tetrateuchal-narratives/oclc/276852204}}: "The subsequent declarations of Aaron's people and Jeroboam are almost identical: 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt' (Exod 32:4, 8); 'Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish views==
[[File:Book of Exodus Chapter 33-8 (Bible Illustrations by Sweet Media).jpg|thumb|The Levites killed about 3,000 Israelites who worshipped the Golden Calf (1984 illustration by Jim Padgett)]]
In ''[[Legends of the Jews]]'', the Conservative rabbi and scholar [[Louis Ginzberg]] wrote that the worship of the golden calf was the disastrous consequence for Israel who took a mixed multitude in [[The Exodus|their exodus]] from Egypt. Had not the mixed multitude joined them, Israel would not have been misled to worship this molten idol. The form of calf itself came from a magical virtue of an ornament leaf with the image of the bull which is made by [[Aaron]].&lt;ref name=Ginzberg&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909). ''The Legends of the Jews Volume III : The Golden Calf'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society&lt;/ref&gt;

The devotion of Israel to this worship of the calf was partly explained by a circumstance at [[Crossing the Red Sea|passing through the Red Sea]], when they beheld the most distinct creature about the Celestial Throne which is the resemblance of ox, then they thought it was an ox who had helped God in their journey from Egypt.&lt;ref name=Ginzberg/&gt; After seeing [[Hur (Bible)|Hur]] son of [[Miriam]] who was carelessly murdered by the people following his rebuke of their ingratitude action to God, [[Aaron]] was willing rather to take a sin upon himself to make an idol than to cast the burden of an evil deed upon the people if they commit so terrible sin of killing a priest and prophet among them.&lt;ref name=Ginzberg/&gt;

Also there would be among the Israelites no [[priestly caste]], and the nation would have been a nation of priests only if Israel had not sinned through worshiping the golden calf that the greater part of the people lost the right to priesthood, except the [[tribe of Levi]] as the only tribe who remained faithful to God and did not partake in this sinful deed.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909) ''The Legends of the Jews Volume III : The Revelations in the Tabernacle'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic narrative==
{{tone|section|date=April 2012}}
{{See also|Moses in Islam|Islamic view of Aaron}}
{{Musa|related}}
The incident of the worship of the golden calf is narrated in the [[Quran]] and other Islamic literature. The Quran narrates that after they refused to enter the promised land, God decreed that as punishment the Israelites would wander for forty years. Moses continued to lead the Israelites to [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] for divine guidance. According to Islamic literature, God ordered Moses to [[fasting|fast]] for thirty days, and upon near completion of the thirty days, Moses ate a scented plant to improve the odour of his mouth. God commanded Moses to fast for ten more days, before receiving the guidance for the Israelites. When Moses completed the fasts, he approached God for guidance. During this time, Moses had instructed the Israelites that Aaron (''[[Harun]]'') was to lead them. The Israelites grew restless, since Moses had not returned to them, and after thirty days, a man the Quran names [[Samiri (Islamic figure)|Samiri]] raised doubts among the Israelites. Samiri claimed that Moses had forsaken the Israelites and ordered his followers among the Israelites to light a fire and bring him all the jewelry and gold ornaments they had.&lt;ref name="M. Th Houtsma 136"&gt;{{cite book|title=First encyclopaedia of Islam: 1913-1936|author=M. Th Houtsma|page=136|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=sP_hVmik-QYC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=golden+calf+islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u5j2T4DfD4S0-QaextDwBg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samiri fashioned the gold into a golden calf along with the dust on which the angel Gabriel had trodden, which he proclaimed to be the God of Moses and the God who had guided them out of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Prophets, Their Lives and Their Stories|author=Abdul-Sahib Al-Hasani Al-'amili|page=354|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YyYS_hjKpEC&amp;pg=PA356&amp;dq=the+prophets+their+lives+and+their+stories+punishment+of+the+golden+calf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4pf2T962PMbO-gaKgPHHBg&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a sharp contrast between the Quranic and the biblical accounts of the prophet Aaron's actions. The Quran mentions that Aaron attempted to guide and warn the people from worshipping the golden calf. However, the Israelites refused to stop until Moses had returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stories of the Prophets - قصص الانبياء|author=IslamKotob, Sayyed Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXlHIskrYXEC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=prophets+stories+islam+musa+the+torah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zpv2T6LpEom8-QbZsrjcBg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The righteous separated themselves from the pagans. God informed Moses that he had tried the Israelites in his absence and that they had failed by worshipping the golden calf.

Returning to the Israelites in great anger, Moses asked Aaron why he had not stopped the Israelites when he had seen them worshipping the golden calf. The Quran reports that Aaron stated that he did not act due to the fear that Moses would blame him for causing divisions among the Israelites. Moses realized his helplessness in the situation, and both prayed to God for forgiveness [http://al-quran.info/#7:150 (Qur'an 7:167-174]). Moses then questioned Samiri for the creation of the golden calf; Samiri justified his actions by stating that he had thrown the dust of the ground upon which Gabriel had tread on into the fire because his [[soul]] had suggested it to him.&lt;ref name="M. Th Houtsma 136"/&gt; Moses informed him that he would be banished and that they would burn the golden calf and spread its dust into the sea. Moses ordered seventy delegates to repent to God and pray for forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stories of the Prophets - قصص الانبياء|author=IslamKotob, Sayyed Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi|page=113|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=mXlHIskrYXEC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=prophets+stories+islam+musa+the+torah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zpv2T6LpEom8-QbZsrjcBg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The delegates traveled alongside Moses to Mount Sinai, where they witnessed the speech between him and God but refused to believe until they had witnessed God with their sight. As punishment, God struck the delegates with lightning and killed them with a violent earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Al-Islam: Inception to Conclusion|author=Iftikhar Ahmed Mehar|page=123|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=O0gypGNaj3kC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=golden+calf+islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9p32T7_iF8j0-gb7wcTaBg&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwBw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses prayed to God for their forgiveness. God forgave and [[Resurrection|resurrected]] them and they continued on their journey.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In the Islamic view, the calf-worshipers' sin had been [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]] ({{lang-ar|شرك}}), the sin of [[idolatry]] or [[polytheism]]. Shirk is the deification or worship of anyone or anything other than [[God in Islam|Allah]], or more literally the establishment of "partners" placed beside God, a most serious and unforgivable sin, with the calf-worshipers' being ultimately forgiven being a mark of special forbearance by Allah.

==Criticism and interpretation==
{{One source|section|date=April 2015}}
Despite a seemingly simplistic façade, the golden calf narrative is complex. According to [[Michael Coogan]], it seems that the golden calf was not an idol for another god, and thus a [[false god]].&lt;ref name=coogan115&gt;{{cite book |author=Coogan, M. |title=A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its context |year=2009 |page=115 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cites {{bibleverse||Exodus|32:4-5|HE}} as evidence:
{{quote|He [Aaron] took the gold from them, formed it in a mold, and cast an image of a calf; and they said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!" When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation and said, "Tomorrow shall be a festival to the {{Lord}} ([[Yahweh]])."}} Importantly, there is a single calf in this narrative. While the people refer to it as representative of the "gods", this is a possessive form of the word Elohim ({{hebrew|אֱלֹהֶיךָ}} ''elo'hecha'', from {{hebrew|אֱלֹהִים}}), which is a name of God as well as general word for "gods". While a reference to singular god does not necessarily imply Yahweh worship, the word usually translated as 'lord' is Yahweh {{Hebrew|יהוה}} in the original, so at least it can't be ruled out.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;  It should also be noted that "in the chronology of the narrative of the Ten Commandments" the commandment against the creation of graven images had not yet been given to the people when they pressed upon Aaron to help them make the calf, and that such behavior was not yet explicitly outlawed.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

Another understanding of the golden calf narrative is that the calf was meant to be the pedestal of Yahweh. In Near Eastern art, gods were often depicted standing on an animal, rather than seated on a throne.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt; This reading suggests that the golden calf was merely an alternative to the [[ark of the covenant]] or the [[cherubim]] upon which Yahweh was enthroned.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

The reason for this complication may be understood as
:(1) a criticism of Aaron, as the founder of one priestly house that rivaled the priestly house of Moses, and/or
:(2) as "an attack on the northern kingdom of Israel."&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;
The second explanation relies on the "sin of [[Jeroboam]]," who was the first king of the northern kingdom, as the cause of the northern kingdom’s fall to Assyria in 722&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt; Jeroboam’s "sin" was creating two calves of gold, and sending one to [[Bethel]] as a worship site in the south of the Kingdom, and the other to [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]] as a worship site in the north, so that the people of the northern kingdom would not have to continue to go to Jerusalem to worship (see 1&amp;nbsp;Kings&amp;nbsp;12:26–30). According to Coogan, this episode is part of the Deuteronomistic history, written in the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]], after the fall of the northern kingdom, which was biased against the northern kingdom.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt; Coogan maintains that Jeroboam was merely presenting an alternative to the [[cherubim]] of the Temple in Jerusalem, and that calves did not indicate non-Yahwehistic worship.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

The [[documentary hypothesis]] can be used to further understand the layers of this narrative: it is plausible that the earliest story of the golden calf was preserved by [[Elohist|E]] (Israel source) and originated in the Northern kingdom. When E and [[Jahwist|J]] (Judah source) were combined after the fall of northern kingdom, "the narrative was reworked to portray the northern kingdom in a negative light," and the worship of the calf was depicted as "polytheism, with the suggestion of a sexual orgy" (see Exodus&amp;nbsp;32:6). When compiling the narratives, [[Priestly source|P]] (a later Priest source from Jerusalem) may have minimized Aaron’s guilt in the matter, but preserved the negativity associated with the calf.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

Alternatively it could be said that there is no golden calf story in the J source, and if it is correct that the Jeroboam story was the original as stated by Friedman, then it is unlikely that the golden calf events as described in Exodus occurred at all. Friedman states that the smashing of the [[Ten Commandments]] by [[Moses]] when he beheld the worship of the golden calf, is really an attempt to cast into doubt the validity of Judah's central shrine, the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. "The author of E, in fashioning the golden calf story, attacked both the Israelite and Judean religious establishments." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Friedman, Richard Elliott |title=Who Wrote the Bible? |year=1987 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As to the likelihood that these events ever took place, on the one hand there are two versions of the ten commandments story, in E (Exodus&amp;nbsp;20) and J (Exodus&amp;nbsp;34), this gives some antiquity and there may be some original events serving as a basis to the stories. The Golden Calf story is only in the E version and a later editor added in an explanation that God made a second pair of tablets to give continuity to the J story.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott. 2003. ''The Bible with Sources Revealed'', p&amp;nbsp;177.&lt;/ref&gt; The actual Ten Commandments as given in Exodus&amp;nbsp;20 were also inserted by the redactor who combined the various sources.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott. 2003. ''The Bible with Sources Revealed'', p&amp;nbsp;153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] say that while archaeology has found traces left by small bands of hunter-gatherers in the Sinai, there is no evidence at all for the large body of people described in the Exodus story: "The conclusion – that Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible – seems irrefutable ... repeated excavations and surveys throughout the entire area have not provided even the slightest evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Finkelstein, Israel |author2=Silberman, Neil Asher |year=2001 |title=The Bible Unearthed |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As adoration of wealth===
A metaphoric interpretation emphasizes the "gold" part of "golden calf" to criticize the pursuit of wealth. This usage can be found in Spanish&lt;ref name="DRAE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltObtenerHtml?LEMA=becerro&amp;SUPIND=0&amp;CAREXT=10000&amp;NEDIC=No#becerro_de_oro. |title=becerro de oro |website=[[Diccionario de la Real Academia Española]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Mammon]], the Gospel personification of idolatry of wealth, is not so current.

'''''Heaven's Gate''''' is a 1980 American [[Epic film|epic]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] film written and directed by [[Michael Cimino]]. Loosely based on the [[Johnson County War]], it portrays a fictional dispute between [[land baron]]s and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] [[immigrant]]s in [[Wyoming]] in the 1890s. The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Christopher Walken]], [[Isabelle Huppert]], [[Jeff Bridges]], [[John Hurt]], [[Sam Waterston]], [[Brad Dourif]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]], [[David Mansfield]], [[Richard Masur]], [[Terry O'Quinn]], [[Mickey Rourke]], [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Nicholas Woodeson]], the last two in their first film roles. It is notable for being one of the biggest [[box office bomb]]s of all-time, losing the studio an estimated $37 million ($114 million in 2012 dollars).&lt;ref name="insider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisinsider.com/movie-flops-over-the-years-2018-2#1978-sextette-1|title=The biggest box office flop from the year you were born|author=Gabbi Shaw|work=Insider |date=February 27, 2017 |accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also initially viewed as one of the [[List of films considered the worst|worst films ever made]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/21/1|title=From hell|first=Joe|last=Queenan|date=March 20, 2008|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticsatlarge.ca/2012/02/michael-ciminos-heavens-gate-and-death.html|title=Critics At Large: Michael Cimino’s Heaven’s Gate and the Death of the Auteur Theory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spartandog76.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/retro-review-heavens-gate-1980/|title=Retro Review – Heaven’s Gate (1980)|date=March 8, 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were major setbacks in the film's production due to cost and time overruns, negative press (including allegations of [[animal abuse]] on-set) and rumors about Cimino's allegedly authoritarian directorial style; the film resultantly opened to scathing reviews, earning only $3.5 million domestically (from an estimated $44 million budget),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-box-office-flops-pictures,0,7165703.photogallery#axzz2tJcnZf9r Eller, Claudia, "The costliest box office flops of all time", ''Los Angeles Times'' (January 15, 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt; eventually causing its parent studio, [[United Artists]], to collapse, and effectively destroying the reputation of Cimino, previously a rising Hollywood ''[[auteur]]'' from the success of his 1978 film ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'', winner of the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] in [[51st Academy Awards|1979]].&lt;ref name=Queenan&gt;Queenan, Joe (March 21, 2008). [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/21/1 "From Hell"]. ''[[The Guardian]]''. Retrieved September 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Cimino had an expensive and ambitious vision, pushing it nearly four times over its planned budget. Its resulting financial problems and United Artists' consequent demise led to a move away from the brief 1970s period of [[New Hollywood|director-driven film production]] in the [[Cinema of the United States|American film industry]], back toward greater [[Studio system|studio control of films]], as had been predominant in Hollywood until the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Biskind|Biskind, Peter]] (1998).

In the decades since the release, however, general assessment of ''Heaven's Gate'' has become more positive.&lt;ref name=Doc/&gt;&lt;ref name="Khan"&gt;Khan, Omar.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
In 1870, two young men, [[Ellen Watson#Life with Averell|Jim Averill]] and Billy Irvine, graduate from [[Harvard College]]. The Reverend Doctor speaks to the graduates on the association of "the cultivated mind with the uncultivated" and the importance of education. Irvine, brilliant but obviously intoxicated, follows this with his opposing, irreverent views. A celebration is then held, after which the male students serenade the women present, including Averill's girlfriend.

Twenty years later, Averill is passing through the booming town of [[Casper, Wyoming]], on his way north to [[Johnson County, Wyoming|Johnson County]], where he is now a [[marshal]]. Poor European immigrants new to the region are in conflict with wealthy, established [[cattle baron]]s organized as the [[Wyoming Stock Growers Association]]; the newcomers sometimes steal their cattle for food. [[Nate Champion]] – a friend of Averill and an enforcer for the stockmen – kills a settler for suspected rustling and dissuades another from stealing a cow. At a board meeting, the head of the Association, [[Frank M. Canton|Frank Canton]], tells members, including a drunk Irvine, of plans to kill 125 named settlers, as thieves and anarchists. Irvine leaves the meeting, encounters Averill, and tells him of the Association's plans. As Averill leaves, he exchanges bitter words with Canton. Canton and Averill quarrel, and Canton is knocked to the floor. That night, Canton recruits men to kill the named settlers.

[[Ella Watson]], a Johnson County bordello madam from [[Quebec]], who accepts stolen cattle as payment for use of her prostitutes, is infatuated with both Averill and Champion. Averill and Watson skate in a crowd, then dance alone, in an enormous [[Roller rink|roller skating rink]] called "Heaven's Gate," which has been built by local entrepreneur, John L. Bridges. Averill receives a copy of the Association's death list from a [[baseball]]-playing [[U.S. Army]] [[Captain (United States)|captain]] and later reads the names aloud to the settlers, who are thrown into terrified turmoil. Cully, a [[station master]] and friend of Averill's, sees the train with Canton's posse heading north and rides off to warn the settlers but is murdered ''en route''. Later, a group of men come to Watson's bordello and rape her. Averill shoots and kills all but one of them. Champion, realizing that his landowner bosses seek to eliminate Watson, goes to Canton's camp, and shoots the remaining rapist, then refuses to participate in the slaughter.

Canton and his men encounter one of Champion's friends leaving a cabin with Champion and his friend Nick inside, and a gunfight ensues. Attempting to save Champion, Watson arrives in her wagon and shoots one of the hired guns before escaping on horseback. Champion and his two friends are killed in a merciless barrage, which ends with his cabin in flames. Watson warns the settlers of Canton's approach at another huge, chaotic gathering at "Heaven's Gate." The agitated settlers decide to counterstrike; Bridges leads the attack on Canton's gang. With the hired invaders now surrounded, both sides suffer casualties (including a drunken, poetic Irvine) as Canton leaves to bring help. Watson and Averill return to Champion's charred and smoking cabin, and discover his corpse, along with a handwritten letter documenting his last minutes alive.

The next day, Averill reluctantly joins the settlers, with their cobbled-together siege machines and explosive charges, in an attack against Canton's men and their makeshift fortifications. Again, there are heavy casualties on both sides, before the U.S. Army, with Canton in the lead, arrives to stop the fighting and save the remaining besieged mercenaries. Later, at Watson's cabin, Bridges, Watson, and Averill prepare to leave for good, but they are ambushed by Canton and two others who shoot and kill Bridges and Watson. After killing Canton and his men, a grief-stricken Averill holds Watson's body in his arms.

In 1903 – about a decade later – a well-dressed, beardless, but older-looking Averill walks the deck of his yacht off [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. He goes below, where an attractive middle-aged woman is sleeping in a luxurious boudoir. The woman, Averill's old Harvard girlfriend (perhaps now his wife), awakens and asks him for a cigarette. Silently he complies, lights it, and returns to the deck.

==Historical background==

The basic plot elements of the film were inspired by Wyoming's 1892 [[Johnson County War]], the archetypal cattlemen-homesteaders conflict, which also served as the background for ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' and ''[[The Virginian (1946 film)|The Virginian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Life-Times-Western-Movie/dp/0831755458|last=Hyams|first=Jay|title=The Life and Times of the Western Movie|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster#Imprints|Gallery Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=1984|isbn=978-0831755454|pages=115–116|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the film's principal characters bear the names of actual key figures in the war, but the events portrayed in ''Heaven's Gate'' bear little resemblance to actual historical events.&lt;ref name="Davis, John W. 2010"&gt;Davis, John W. (2010). Wyoming Range War: The Infamous Invasion of Johnson County. Norman, Oklahoma: [[University of Oklahoma Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-8061-4106-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While homesteaders did begin to settle northern Wyoming in the 1890s, claiming land under the newly enacted [[Homestead Acts]], there were no [[History of Wyoming|hordes of starving European immigrants]],&lt;ref&gt;Larson, T.A. (1990). ''History of Wyoming''. Lincoln, Nebraska: [[University of Nebraska Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-8032-7936-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; killing rich men's cattle to feed their families, as depicted in the film. [[Nate Champion]], who is portrayed as a murderer and "enforcer" for the stockmen, was actually a popular small rancher in [[Johnson County, Wyoming|Johnson County]], nicknamed "king of the rustlers" by the stockmen because he resisted their tactic of claiming all [[Maverick (animal)|unbranded young cattle]] as their own.&lt;ref name="Davis, John W. 2010"/&gt;

[[Ellen Watson#Life with Averell|Jim Averell]] was another homesteader who lived about {{convert|100|mi|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} southwest of Johnson County. Two years before the Johnson County War began, he and his common-law wife [[Ella Watson]] were murdered by stockmen, who falsely accused Watson of exchanging sexual favors for stolen cattle. There is no evidence that Watson was a bordello madam, as portrayed in the film, nor that Watson or Averell ever knew Nate Champion.&lt;ref name="Davis, John W. 2010"/&gt;

==Production==
In 1971, rising Hollywood film director [[Michael Cimino]] submitted an original script for ''Heaven's Gate'' (then called ''The Johnson County War'') but the project was shelved when it failed to attract big-name talent.&lt;ref name=talent&gt;{{cite web|last=Robey|first=Tim|title=Heaven's Gate: the bomb that almost destroyed Hollywood|date=19 July 2013|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/classic-movies/10131915/Heavens-Gate-the-bomb-that-almost-destroyed-Hollywood.html|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His directorial debut, ''[[Thunderbolt and Lightfoot]]'' (1974), was a hit. In 1979, on the eve of winning two Academy Awards ([[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]) for 1978's ''[[The Deer Hunter]],'' Cimino convinced [[United Artists]] to resurrect ''Heaven's Gate'' project with [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Isabelle Huppert]], and [[Christopher Walken]] as the main characters.

According to legend, by the sixth day of filming the project was already five days behind schedule.&lt;ref name=talent/&gt; As an example of Cimino's fanatical attention to detail, a street built to his precise specifications had to be torn down and rebuilt because it reportedly "didn't look right." The street in question needed to be six feet wider; the set construction boss said it would be cheaper to tear down one side and move it back six feet, but Cimino insisted that both sides be dismantled and moved back three feet, then reassembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtpchcpwUioC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q=heavens%20gate%20street%20rebuilt%20it%20didn't%20look%20right|isbn=9781402736742|title=Movie Idols|year=2006|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|last2=Wrathall|first2=John|last1=Molloy|first1=Mick}}&lt;/ref&gt; An entire tree was cut down, moved in pieces, and relocated to the courtyard where the Harvard 1870 graduation scene was shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cochrane|first=John|title=A Hollywood Elegy: Revisiting Heaven's Gate|date=21 May 2013|url=http://www.charlotteviewpoint.org/article/3053/A-Hollywood-Elegy-Revisiting-Heaven%27s-Gate|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cimino had an irrigation system built under the land where the major battlefield scene would unfold, so that it would remain vividly green, to contrast with the red color it would later be awash with after the bloody carnage.&lt;ref name=Dargis /&gt;

Cimino shot more than 1.3 million feet (nearly 220 hours) of footage, costing the studio approximately $200,000 per day in salary, locations, and acting fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_M3nR4wI99AC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q=michael%20cimino%20shot%20more%20than%201.3%20million%20feet|title=A New Pot of Gold: Hollywood Under the Electronic Rainbow, 1980-1989|last=Prince|first=Stephen|year=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520232662}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privately, it was said Cimino wished to surpass [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s mark of shooting one million feet of footage for ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979).&lt;ref name=talent/&gt;

Cimino's obsessive behavior soon earned him the nickname "The Ayatollah". Production fell behind schedule as rumors spread of Cimino's demanding up to 50 takes of individual scenes and delaying filming until a cloud that he liked rolled into the frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/38815985?slide=9 |title=The 15 Biggest Box Office Bombs -&gt; ''Heaven's Gate'' #8|work= [[CNBC]]|accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the delays, several musicians originally brought to Montana to work on the film for only three weeks ended up stranded, waiting to be called for shoots to materialize, and simply sat there for six months. The experience, as the [[Associated Press]] put it, "was both stunningly boring and a raucous good time, full of [[jam session]]s, strange adventures and curiously little actual shooting." The jam sessions served as the beginning of numerous musical collaborations between Bridges and Kristofferson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=D'Ambrosio|first1=Brian|title=Bridges talks about Montana in advance of Missoula show|url=http://lastbestnews.com/site/2016/03/bridges-talks-about-montana-in-advance-of-missoula-show/|website=Last Best News|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As production staggered forward, United Artists seriously considered firing Cimino and replacing him with another director, reportedly Norman Jewison.&lt;ref name=slave/&gt;

Actor [[John Hurt]] reportedly spent so long waiting around on the production for something to do that he went off and made ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' (1980) for [[David Lynch]] in the interim, and then came back to shoot more scenes on ''Heaven's Gate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=10 stories of excess from the production of Heaven's Gate|date=27 March 2014|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/heavens-gate/29865/10-stories-of-excess-from-the-production-of-heavens-gate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Heaven's Gate'' finished shooting in March 1980, having cost nearly $30 million.&lt;ref name=million&gt;{{cite web|last=Dargis|first=Manhola|title=The Second Coming of ‘Heaven’s Gate’|date=15 March 2013|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/movies/michael-ciminos-heavens-gate-returns-to-film-forum.html|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, during post-production Cimino changed the lock to the studio's editing room, prohibiting executives from seeing the film until he completed his cut, although Cimino disputed the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abramovitch|first1=Seth|title='Deer Hunter' Director's First Interview in 13 Years: Michael Cimino Touts Clint Eastwood for President, Blasts Rumors He's Becoming a Woman|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/deer-hunter-directors-first-interview-773132|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with Oscar-winning editor [[William H.

He wanted awe. The idea was that the magic man was in his workshop doing his magic, and we should all just leave him alone and let him finish."

===Workprint cut and eventual plans for release===
On June 26, 1980, Cimino previewed a [[workprint]] for executives at United Artists that reportedly ran five hours and twenty-five minutes (325 minutes), which Cimino said was "about 15 minutes longer than the final cut would be."&lt;ref name="BachFinalCut"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bach|first=Steven|title=Final Cut: Art, Money, and Ego in the Making of Heaven's Gate, the Film That Sank United Artists|origyear=1985|year=1999|publisher=Newmarket Press|location=New York, NY|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The executives flatly refused to release the film at that length and once again contemplated firing Cimino.&lt;ref name = BachFinalCut/&gt; However, Cimino promised them he could re-edit the film and spent the entire summer and fall of 1980 doing so, finally paring it down to its original premiere length of 3 hours and 39 minutes (219 minutes). The original wide-release opening on Christmas of 1979 had come and gone, so UA and Cimino finally set up a release date in November 1980.&lt;ref name=million/&gt;

==Reception==

===Initial reactions===
The final cut finally premiered at New York's Cinema 1 theater on November 19, 1980. The premiere was, by all accounts, a disaster. During the intermission, the audience was so subdued that Cimino was said to have asked why no one was drinking the champagne. He was reportedly told by his publicist, "Because they hate the movie, Michael."&lt;ref name = BachFinalCut /&gt;

''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[Vincent Canby]] panned the film, calling it "something quite rare in movies these days - an unqualified disaster," comparing it to "a forced four-hour walking tour of one's own living room." Canby went even further by stating that "[i]t fails so completely that you might suspect Mr. Cimino sold his soul to the devil to obtain the success of ''The Deer Hunter'' and the Devil has just come around to collect."&lt;ref name="Canby"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940CE4D61638F93AA25752C1A966948260 |title='Heaven's Gate,' A Western by Cimino |author=[[Vincent Canby|Canby, Vincent]] |date=November 19, 1980 |work= [[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a sparsely attended one-week run, Cimino and United Artists quickly pulled the film from any further releases, completely postponing a full worldwide release.&lt;ref name="Doc"&gt;{{cite video | people = [[Michael Epstein (film director)|Epstein, Michael]] | year = 2004 | title = Final Cut: The Making and Unmaking of Heaven's Gate | url = //www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5LJ0DmlDlM | format = | medium = television | publisher = Viewfinder Productions | location = | accessdate = | time = | id = | isbn = | oclc = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1981 in [[Los Angeles]], the film resurfaced in a "director's cut" two-hour-twenty-nine-minute (149 minute) version that Cimino had recut for a third time.&lt;ref name=Doc /&gt; Reviewing the shorter cut in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] criticized the film's formal choices and its narrative inconsistencies and incredulities, concluding that the film was "[t]he most scandalous cinematic waste I have ever seen, and remember, I've seen ''[[Paint Your Wagon (film)|Paint Your Wagon]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]] |date=1981| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19810101/REVIEWS/101010302/1023 |title=''Heaven's Gate'' review|work= [[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate= March 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Thomas of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' issued a dissenting opinion when he reviewed the shortened film, becoming one of its few American champions and calling it "a true screen epic" while stating that in two decades as a critic, he had never felt "so totally alone."&lt;ref name=Doc/&gt;

The film closed after the second week, having grossed only $1.3 million total on its $44 million budget.&lt;ref name=Doc/&gt;

In 1999, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' placed the film on a list of the 100 worst ideas of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991230,00.html |title=The 100 Worst Ideas Of The Century |date=June 14, 1999 |accessdate=April 8, 2018|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |first1=Melissa |last1=August |first2=Harriet |last2=Barovick |first3=Michelle |last3=Derrow |first4=Tam |last4=Gray |first5=Daniel S. |last5=Levy |first6=Lina |last6=Lofaro |first7=David |last7=Spitz |first8=Joel |last8=Stein |first9=Chris |last9=Taylor}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2008, [[Joe Queenan]] declared ''Heaven’s Gate'' the worst film made up to that time. “This is a movie that destroyed the director's career,” he wrote. “This is a movie that lost so much money it literally drove a major American studio out of business. This is a movie about Harvard-educated gunslingers who face off against eastern European sodbusters in an epic struggle for the soul of America. This is a movie that stars Isabelle Huppert as a shotgun-toting cowgirl. This is a movie in which Jeff Bridges pukes while mounted on roller skates. This is a movie that has five minutes of uninterrupted fiddle-playing by a fiddler who is also mounted on roller skates. This is a movie that defies belief.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Queenan|first=Joe|title=From hell|date=20 March 2008|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/21/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reassessments===
In subsequent years, some critics have come to the film's defense, beginning with European critics who praised it after the film played at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=Doc/&gt;&lt;ref name="Khan" /&gt; [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] was an early champion of ''Heaven's Gate'' and its reassessment, calling it "one of the few authentically innovative Hollywood films&amp;nbsp;...

Combustible Celluloid. Retrieved November 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] calls the film "a wounded monster" and argues that it takes part in "a rich American tradition ([[Herman Melville|Melville]], [[Henry James|James]], [[Charles Ives|Ives]], [[Jackson Pollock|Pollock]], [[Charlie Parker|Parker]]) that seeks a mighty dispersal of what has gone before. In America, there are great innovations in art that suddenly create fields of apparent emptiness. They may seem like omissions or mistakes at first. Yet in time we come to see them as meant for our exploration."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Thomson (film critic)|Thomson, David]] (October 14, 2008).

[[Independent Film Channel|IFC]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these critics have attempted to impugn the motives of the earliest reviewers. Robin Wood noted, in his initial review of the film, reviewers tended to pile on the film, attempting to "outdo [one an]other with sarcasm and contempt."&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Robin|title=Hollywood from Vietnam to Reagan|year=1986|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-12966-1|pages=267, 269, 283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several members of the cast and crew have complained that the initial reviews of the film were tainted by its production history and that daily critics were reviewing it as a business story as much as a motion picture.&lt;ref name=Doc/&gt; In April 2011, the staff of ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out London]]'' selected ''Heaven's Gate'' as the 12th greatest Western of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/1019/the-50-greatest-westerns-r-the-full-list |title=The 50 greatest westerns|work =[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] |location=London|date= April 2011|accessdate= April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Peter Biskind]] covered the many excesses and problems with the movie in his book ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'', he also noted that ''Heaven's Gate'' was not dissimilar to other big-budget, troubled projects of the late 1970s and early 1980s (such as [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'' and [[Warren Beatty]]'s ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]''), and that the backlash against ''Heaven's Gate'' could have easily been directed elsewhere. Biskind speculated that Michael Cimino's personal unpopularity was the main reason this film became so widely reviled.

===2012–13 re-release and acclaim===
In the fall of 2012, the film was re-released to "soak up acclaim" as a 216-minute "[[director's cut]]" at the [[69th Venice Film Festival]]&lt;ref name="2012-nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/venice-film-festival-michael-cimino-revisits-heavens-gate/ |title=Venice Film Festival: Michael Cimino Revisits 'Heaven's Gate' |date= August 31, 2012 |accessdate=October 28, 2012 |author=Lim, Dennis |publisher= ''[[The New York Times]]'' (''ArtBeats'') }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2012-lemonde"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sotinel.blog.lemonde.fr/2012/08/31/venise-2012-michael-cimino-retrouve-la-cle-du-paradis/ |title=Venise 2012: Michael Cimino retrouve la clé du paradis |date= August 31, 2012 |accessdate=October 28, 2012 |author=Sotinel, Thomas |work = Le Monde |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2012-lesoir"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lesoir.be/archives?url=/culture/cinema/2012-08-31/mostra-de-venise-cimino-est-enfin-au-paradis-935062.php|title=Mostra de Venise : Cimino est (enfin) au paradis|date= August 31, 2012|accessdate=October 28, 2012|author=Crousse, Nicolas|work=Le Soir|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; on August 30 in the presence of Cimino, followed one month later by screening at the [[New York Film Festival]] in the "Masterwork" lineup, along with [[Laurence Olivier]]'s ''[[Richard III (1955 film)|Richard III]]'' and [[Frank Oz]]'s director's cut of ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]''.&lt;ref name="2012-times" /&gt; It was then shown at the [[Lumière Film Festival|Festival Lumière]] in France, where Venice Festival director Alberto Barbera described the film as an "absolute masterpiece" that had disappeared, and whose 1980 cutting was characterized as a "massacre" by nervous producers and had been "one of the greatest injustices of cinematic history" that had destroyed careers (Cimino and Kristofferson) following "annihilat[ing]" critical reviews.&lt;ref name="2012-times" /&gt;

In March 2013, the new director's cut was again featured back in New York City in a week-long run screening at the [[Film Forum]]. A major article by ''New York Times'' critic [[Manohla Dargis]] opined that the film's "second coming&amp;nbsp;... brightens a murky, legendary work of art" in a restoration that also "reveals the contradictions of a great flop."&lt;ref name="Dargis"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|title=The Second Coming of 'Heaven's Gate'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/movies/michael-ciminos-heavens-gate-returns-to-film-forum.html|accessdate=16 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2017}} An article by Nicholas Barber on the [[BBC]] website in December 2015 traced the history of the critical reception of ''Heaven's Gate'' and concludes: "so much of ''Heaven's Gate'' is patently splendid that it is mind-boggling that anyone could pronounce it an 'unqualified disaster'. And the scenes which were slammed in 1980 as being symptomatic of waste and excess – the Harvard waltz, the massed rollerskating – are the scenes which take your breath away."

==Controversy==

===Impact on the U.S. film industry===
The film's $44 million cost (${{Inflation|US-CAP|44|1980}} million in {{Inflation-year|US-CAP}} dollars) and poor performance at the box office ($3.5 million gross in the United States) generated more negative publicity than actual financial damage, causing [[Transamerica Corporation]], United Artists' corporate owner, to become anxious over its own public image and to abandon film production altogether.

Transamerica then sold United Artists to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], which effectively ended the studio's existence. MGM would later revive UA as a subsidiary division. While the money loss due to ''Heaven's Gate'' was considerable, United Artists was still a thriving studio with a steady income provided by the ''[[James Bond in film|James Bond]]'', ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|The Pink Panther]]'' and ''[[Rocky]]'' franchises. On the other hand, UA was already struggling after the executive walkout in 1978 and several other major box office flops in 1980, including ''[[Cruising (film)|Cruising]]'', ''[[Foxes (film)|Foxes]]'' and ''[[Roadie (1980 film)|Roadie]]''.

The fracas had a wider effect on the American film industry. During the 1970s, relatively young directors such as Coppola, Scorsese, [[Peter Bogdanovich]], [[George Lucas]], [[William Friedkin]], and [[Steven Spielberg]] had been given large budgets with very little studio control (see [[New Hollywood]]). The studios evolved away from the director-driven film and eventually led to the new paradigm of the [[high concept]] feature, epitomized by ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' and ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''. However, the directors' power lessened considerably, as a result of disappointing box-office performers such as both Friedkin's ''[[Sorcerer (film)|Sorcerer]]'' (1977) and ''Cruising'' (1980), and culminating in Coppola's ''[[One from the Heart]]'' and Cimino's ''Heaven's Gate''. As the new high-concept paradigm of filmmaking became more entrenched, studio control of budgets and productions became tighter, ending the free-wheeling excesses that had begotten ''Heaven's Gate''.

The very poor box office performance of the film also contributed to a negative impact on the Western genre, which had enjoyed a revival since the late 1960s. Very few Western films were released from 1980 on by major studios, save for ''[[Pale Rider]]'' and ''[[Silverado (film)|Silverado]]'', both released in 1985, and a brief revival in the early 1990s with the Oscar-winning hits ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'', ''[[Unforgiven]]'' and ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]''.

===Accusations of cruelty to animals===
The film was marred by accusations of cruelty to animals during production. One assertion was that live horses were bled from the neck without giving them pain-killers so that their blood could be collected and smeared upon the actors in a scene. The [[American Humane Association]] (AHA) asserted that four horses were killed and many more injured during a battle scene. It was claimed that one of the horses was blown up by dynamite. This footage appears in the final cut of the film.

The AHA was barred from monitoring the animal action on the set. According to the AHA, the owner of an abused horse filed a lawsuit against the producers, director, Partisan Productions, and the horse [[Wrangler (profession)|wrangler]]. The owner cited wrongful injury and breach of contract for willfully depriving her Arabian [[gelding]] of proper care. The suit cited "the severe physical and behavioral trauma and disfigurement" of the horse. The case was settled out of court.&lt;ref name="AHA-review"&gt;[http://www.humanehollywood.org/index.php/movie-archive/item/heaven-s-gate "Heaven's Gate"]. [[American Humane Association]]. Retrieved March 19, 2013. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626141144/http://www.humanehollywood.org/index.php/movie-archive/item/heaven-s-gate |date=June 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were accusations of actual [[cockfight]]s, decapitated chickens, and a group of cows disemboweled to provide "fake intestines" for the actors.&lt;ref name="AHA-review" /&gt; The outcry prompted the [[Screen Actors Guild|Screen Actors Guild (SAG)]] and the [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers|Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP)]] to contractually authorize the AHA to monitor the use of all animals in all filmed media.&lt;ref name="AHA-review" /&gt;

The film is listed on AHA's list of unacceptable films.&lt;ref name="AHA-review" /&gt; The AHA protested the film by distributing an international press release detailing the assertions of animal cruelty and asking people to boycott it. AHA organized [[picketing (protest)|picket lines]] outside movie theaters in Hollywood while local humane societies did the same across the USA. Though ''Heaven's Gate'' was not the first film to have animals killed during its production, it is believed that the film was largely responsible for sparking the now common use of the "No animals were harmed&amp;nbsp;..." disclaimer and more rigorous supervision of animal acts by the AHA, which had been inspecting film production since the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/cruelcamera/ "Cruel Camera"].

All available versions released in the UK (including the 2012 directors cut) have mandated BBFC cuts to the animal cruelty.

===Workprint cut, premiere cut and an alternative cut===
Notwithstanding the 325-minute "workprint" cut shown to executives in June 1980, Cimino had rushed through post-production and editing in order to meet his contractual requirements to United Artists, and to qualify for the 1980 [[Academy Awards]].&lt;ref name = Doc/&gt; The version screened at the November 1980 premiere ran three hours and 39 minutes. Bridges joked that Cimino had worked on the film so close to the premiere that the print screened was still wet from the lab.&lt;ref name=Doc/&gt;

After the aborted one-week premiere run in New York, Cimino and United Artists pulled the film; Cimino wrote an open letter to the studio that was printed in several trade papers blaming unrealistic deadline pressures for the film's failure.&lt;ref name="Egan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Egan|first=Jack|title=Bombs Away|accessdate= March 13, 2012 | publisher = ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' (via [[Google Books]]) |date=December 8, 1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_eQCAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; United Artists reportedly also hired its own editor to try to edit Cimino's footage into a releasable film with no real success.&lt;ref name=Egan/&gt;

Ultimately, Cimino's second edited version, a 149-minute version, premiered in April 1981 and was the only cut of the film screened in wide release. The original negative for the longer version no longer exists because it was directly edited on for the 149-minute version ([[Separation masters|YCM Separation Masters]] of the longer version was used as the source for the Criterion Collection release).  This cut of the film is not just shorter but differs radically in placement of scenes and selection of takes.&lt;ref name=Wood/&gt; This version, after leaving theaters, was not released on home video of any kind in the United States, but was later released on DVD in France ("la Porte du Paradis"). This version has also aired on the MGM HD cable channel and was available free-with-ads on US streaming provider [[Tubi]] from March to November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.tubi.tv/2017/03/07/tubi-tvs-march-free-movie-arrivals/|title=Watch Free Movies at Tubi TV: What’s New for March 2017|website=blog.tubi.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cordcuttersnews.com/everything-free-tubi-tv-november-2017/|title=Here is Everything FREE on Tubi TV in November 2017|website=cordcuttersnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, [[Z Channel]] aired the 219-minute 1980 premiere version of the film on cable television – the first time that the longer version was widely exhibited – and which Z Channel dubbed the "director's cut." As critic [[F.X. Feeney]] noted in the documentary ''[[Z Channel: A Magnificent Obsession]]'', Z Channel's broadcast of ''Heaven's Gate'' first popularized the concept of a "director's cut." &lt;ref&gt;Cassavetes, Xan (director), Feeney, F.X. (critic). (2004). ''Z: A Magnificent Obsession''. [Film]. [[Independent Film Channel|IFC]].&lt;/ref&gt;

When MGM (which acquired the rights to United Artists's catalog after its demise) released the film on [[VHS]] and [[videodisc]] in the 1980s, it released Cimino's 219-minute cut with the tagline "Heaven's Gate... The Legendary Uncut Version." Subsequent releases on [[LaserDisc]] and [[DVD]] have contained only the 219-minute cut.

Due to the wide availability of the 219-minute 1980 premiere version of ''Heaven's Gate'' and its frequent labeling as either "uncut" or the "director's cut," Cimino insisted that the so-called "original version" did not fully correspond to his intentions, and that he was under pressure to bring it out for the predetermined date and did not consider the film ready, making even the 219-minute version essentially an "unfinished" film.&lt;ref name=Wood/&gt;

The 216-minute version shown in Venice is quite similar to the 219-minute version, but with no intermission. Some shots in the second part are slightly shorter and a shot with a single line has been cut (just after John Hurt is beaten by Sam Waterston).

===149-minute cut===
In the 149-minute version of ''Heaven's Gate'' released in 1981, the following scenes are cut:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiewire.com/2014/04/directors-cut-10-theatrical-versions-vs-the-filmmakers-final-vision-87520/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Irvine's speech at the Harvard graduation
* The co-ed circle dancing immediately following graduation
* Averill beating up the brute enforcer (who beats up the immigrant in front of his wife and kids)
* Averill passing the beaten man's widow in the carriage, asking her how she's doing
* The spitting fight between the two immigrant landowners in the cockfight scene
* The entire roller skating dance scene
* A shot of female immigrants carrying a load up the hill
* Champion almost shooting the stock grower that insults Ella Watson
* The scene where Ella Watson first leaves Champion to return to Averill
* The introductory part of the scene where Averill reads the names on the "death list" (the edited version starts with John Bridges firing the gun in the air, to restore order)
* Averill weeping to Bridges that he "hates getting old," while looking at the old photo of himself and his girlfriend
* The immigrants being informed that Averill quit his post, and Watson warning them the stock growers have arrived
* The last five or so minutes of the second battle scene, including the footage of the character crushed under the wagon and the woman killing him in mercy
* That same woman killing herself, post-battle, and Bridges and Averill surveying the carnage
* Any reference to the woman on the boat, presumably Averill's girlfriend or wife, from the end of the film

===2005 radical cut===
In 2005, MGM released the film in selected cinemas in the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name="Macnab"&gt;{{cite news|last=Macnab|first=Geoffrey|title=Heaven Can Wait|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/feb/23/1|accessdate= March 13, 2012| work = [[The Guardian]] |date= February 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 219-minute cut was reassembled by MGM archivist John Kirk, who reported that large portions of the original negative had been discarded, making this an all-new radical version using whatever alternative available scenes that could be found.&lt;ref name=Macnab/&gt; The restored print was screened in [[Paris]] and presented to a sold-out audience at New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] with a live introduction by Isabelle Huppert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecranlarge.com/article-details_c-interview-167.php "Michael Cimino – Paris ''Heaven's Gate'' Master class"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614094557/http://www.ecranlarge.com/article-details_c-interview-167.php |date=June 14, 2011 }}. ecranlarge.com. Retrieved November 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the project was commissioned by then-MGM executive [[Bingham Ray]], who was ousted shortly thereafter, the budget for the project was cut and a planned wider release and DVD never materialized and probably never will.&lt;ref name=Macnab/&gt;

===2012 digitally restored Director's Cut===
In 2012, MGM released yet another version, digitally restored and 216 minutes long. It premiered at the [[2012 Venice Film Festival]] as part of the Venice Classics series.&lt;ref&gt;Drees, Rich (August 31, 2012).

[[The Criterion Collection]] released the restored 216 minute version on [[Blu-ray Disc]] and DVD on November 20, 2012. This "Director's Cut" was personally supervised by Michael Cimino and Joann Carelli. Cimino explains in the special features portion of the DVD that this is his preferred version of the film, and he feels it is the complete version he intended to make.

The '''Kerameikos steles''' are a collection of sculptures used as grave-markers ([[steles]], sing. stele) in the [[Kerameikos]] necropolis of Attica. [[Kerameikos]] is located outside the [[Themistoclean Wall]]'s [[Dipylon Gate]]. Stelai come in various shapes/designs and depict images varying from pottery to narrative scenes. They were often marble or limestone, and were carved or sculpted to depict the person being memorialized sometimes with relatives or slaves. Reliefs decorating the graves were meant to show the dead in their best light, using imagery to recognize their bravery in battle, or pathos, or wealth. These monuments marked the graves of Athenian men, fallen warriors, as well as non-citizens.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Hook|first=LaRue|date=1932|title=On the Lacedaemonians Buried in the Kerameikos|jstor=498389|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=36|issue=3|pages=290–292|doi=10.2307/498389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were also included in Kerameikos but typically it was the wealthiest or prominent women who were given stele.&lt;ref&gt;[[Evelyn Lord Smithson|Smithson, E.]] (1968).

This was likely a popular way to adorn the graves of Greek loved ones.

== History ==
The first steles were dated from the [[Early Bronze Age]], around 2000 B.C. The use of steles as grave markers gained popularity in Kerameikos around the [[Geometric art|Protogeometric period]] c.a. 950 B.C.E. until they fell out of style around the 8th century C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Blegen, C.

== Styles ==
[[File:Dexileos.JPG|left|300x300px|thumb|Grave Stele of Dexileos]]
Athenians used Kerameikos for centuries to bury their dead. Over time different styles were introduced so there is a great variety of graves that came from Kerameikos. Notable styles found in Kerameikos include the naiskos stele, lekythos graves, and kore.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery, L. (1962). The Inscribed Gravestones of Archaic Attica. ''The Annual of the British School at Athens,'' ''57'', 115-153. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/30104502&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Graves were inscribed with the name of the deceased and where they came from.

Some steles at Kerameikos used a style known as [[naiskos]] ("small temple"), which looks like a temple with columns and a pediment at the top. This particular symbol of wealth gained popularity in the 5th century B.C. examples include the [[Grave Stele of Dexileos]] and the [[Grave Stele of Hegeso]].

== Notable burials and graves ==
After the Battle of Chairon and Thibrachos, [[Lacedaemonian]] soldiers of [[Pausanias of Sparta|King Pausanias]]' army were buried at Kerameikos. The tomb was found marked by a marble plinth with Lacedaemonian inscriptions of the names of the men.&lt;ref&gt;Van Hook, L. (1932). On the Lacedaemonians Buried in the Kerameikos.

The [[Grave Stele of Hegeso]] is one of the best-preserved surviving attic stele and features a woman seated by her servant. This grave is a naiskos, meaning Hegeso was likely a prominent woman as this style signified wealth and importance.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, L.M.W. (1905). ''A History of Ancient Sculpture''.

Today the Kerameikos grave monuments can be found at the [[Kerameikos Archaeological Museum]] where many of them are preserved and kept on display.

'''Light painting, painting with light,''' '''light drawing''', or '''light art performance photography''' are terms that describe [[photography|photographic]] techniques of moving a light source while taking a [[long exposure]] photograph, either to illuminate a subject or space, or to shine light at the [[camera]] to 'draw', or by moving the camera itself during exposure of light sources. Practised since the 1880s, the technique is used for both scientific and artistic purposes, as well as in commercial photography.

== History ==

Light painting (also called light drawing) dates back to 1889 when [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] and [[Georges Demenÿ|Georges Demeny]] traced human motion in the first known light painting ''Pathological Walk From in Front''.&lt;ref name="lightphoto"&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=http://lightpaintingphotography.com/light-painting-history/ |website=Light Painting Photography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique was used in [[Frank Gilbreth]]'s work with his wife [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]] in 1914, when the pair used small lights and the open shutter of a camera to track the motion of manufacturing and clerical workers.

[[Man Ray]], in his 1935 series "Space Writing," was the first known art photographer to use the technique. He made a self-portrait with a time exposure and while the shutter was open, with a penlight he inscribed his name in cursive script in the space between him and the camera, overwriting the letters with more cryptic marks.&lt;ref&gt;Foresta, M. (1991). Tracing the Line: Art and Photography in the Age of Contact.

[[File:Pure Energy and Neurotic Man 1940.jpg|thumb|right|''Pure Energy and Neurotic Man,'' a light painting by [[Barbara Morgan (photographer)|Barbara Morgan]] (1940)]]
Photographer [[Barbara Morgan (photographer)|Barbara Morgan]] began making light paintings in 1935-1941.&lt;ref&gt;Franks, Elizabeth Ellen. “Capturing Motion: A Catalog Raisonné of the Photomontage Works of Barbara Morgan 1935-1980.” MA Thesis, University of California Riverside, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Her 1941 photomontage ''Pure Energy and Neurotic Man'' incorporates light drawing and realises her stated aim; "that if I should ever seriously photograph, it would be...the flux of things. I wanted then, and still do, to express the ‘thing’ as part of total flow."&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Barbara, and Marianne F. Margolis. Barbara Morgan: Photomontage. Dobbs Ferry, N.Y: Morgan &amp; Morgan, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; In making innovative photographs of dancers, including [[Martha Graham]] and [[Erick Hawkins]] she would have them move while holding lights.

In 1949 [[Pablo Picasso]] was visited by [[Gjon Mili]], a photographer and lighting innovator, who introduced Picasso to his photographs of ice skaters with lights attached to their skates.  Immediately Picasso started making images in the air with a small flashlight in a dark room.  This series of photos became known as Picasso's "light drawings."

Peter Keetman (1916–2005), who studied photography in [[Munich]] from 1935 to 1937, was the 1949 co-founder of [[Fotoform|FotoForm]] (together with [[Otto Steinert]], Toni Schneiders et al.), a group with great impact on the new photography in the 50s and 60s in Germany and abroad. He produced a series ''Schwingungsfigur'' (oscillating figures) of complex linear meshes, often with moiré effects, using a point-source light on a pendulum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Jäger, Gottfried | author2=Reese, Beate | author3=Krauss, Rolf H | title=Concrete photography = Konkrete fotografie | publication-date=2005 | publisher=Kerber Verlag | isbn=978-3-936646-74-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 80's [[Eric Staller]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ericstaller.com/studio%20work/light%20drawings/ Eric Staller - Light Drawings]&lt;/ref&gt; used this technology for numerous photo projects that were called "Light Drawings". Light paintings up to 1976 are classified as light drawings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In 1977 [[Dean Chamberlain]] extended the technique using handheld lights to selectively illuminate and/or colour parts of the subject or scene with his image ''Polyethylene Bags On Chaise Longue'' at The [[Rochester Institute of Technology]]. Dean Chamberlain was the first artist to dedicate his entire body of work to the light painting art form.&lt;ref name="lightphoto" /&gt; The artist photographer [[Jacques Pugin]] made several series of images with the light drawing technique in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lpwalliance.com/index2.php?type=publicationview&amp;id=41 |title=Light Painting Historical Catalogue (part two) |website=[[Light Painting World Alliance]] (LPWA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, with modern light painting, one uses more frequently choreography and performance to photograph and organize.

Since the 1980s, [[Vicki DaSilva]] has been working exclusively in light painting and light graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McRee |first=Claire |date=2016 |title=Allentown X7 Photographic Explorations |publisher=Allentown Art Museum of the Lehigh Valley |chapter=The Multivalent Subject: Photographic Approaches to Allentown |isbn=978-1-882011-65-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, DaSilva&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vickidasilva.com/ Vicki DaSilva]&lt;/ref&gt; started making deliberate text light graffiti works, the first being "Cash".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vickidasilva.com/light-gra/ Vicki DaSilva - Light Graffiti]&lt;/ref&gt; She continued these light graffiti photographs throughout the 1980s and eventually started using 4 foot fluorescent bulbs hooked up to pulley systems to create sheets of light. In the early 2000s she began making work with 8 foot fluorescent lamps, holding the lamp vertically and walking through spaces with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vickidasilva.com/interiors/ Vicki DaSilva - Light Painting - Interiors]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vickidasilva.com/exteriors/ Vicki DaSilva - Light Painting - Exteriors]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1980s [[Tokihiro Satō]]'s photographs combine light, time and space in recording his movements in a series beginning with his “photo respirations” where his use of an 8 x 10-inch [[view camera]] fitted with a strong [[neutral-density filter]] to achieve lengthy exposures lasting one to three hours provide the opportunity for him to move through the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author1=Satō, Tokihiro | author2=Siegel, Elizabeth | title=Photo respiration : Tokihiro Sato photographs | publication-date=2005 | publisher=Art Institute of Chicago | location=Chicago | edition= 1st | oclc=718345388 | isbn=978-0-86559-217-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When shooting in daylight, with a mirror he flashed light from the sun into the camera lens, resulting in points of light and flares that punctuate the image and track his movements, though his presence is not seen directly. For nocturnal or interior views he “draws” with a small torch.

Light painting as an artform enjoyed a surge in popularity in the 21st century, partly due to the increasing availability of [[dSLR]] cameras and [[Camera phone|mobile phone cameras]] enabling immediate feedback for adjustments of lights and exposure; advances in portable light sources such as LEDs; and the advent of media sharing websites by which practitioners can exchange images and ideas.

In March 2007, [[JanLeonardo]] coined the term ''light art performance photography (LAPP)''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;JanLeonardo Woellert &amp; Joerg Miedza - Faszination Lichtmalerei: Die Kunst der Light Art Performance Photography, 09/2010, dpunkt Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3-89864-669-7}} (German)&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasises the performative aspect that is evident earlier in [[Tokihiro Satō|Satō]]'s work,&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. (2016). IN TERMS OF ART. Art and AsiaPacific (100), 98-109.&lt;/ref&gt; and used it to describe the creation of new figures and structures only with light. Following the original [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] meaning of [[Photography]] (Greek φῶς, phos, genetive: φωτός, photos, "light" (of the luminary), "brightness" and γράφειν, graphein, "drawing", "carve", "create", "write") it is a [[symbiosis]] of [[light art]] and photography. The main difference from other ''light painting'' or ''light writing'', it has been claimed,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; is the role of the background in the photo.{{Clarify|clarification needed=|date=July 2018}} Locations in the natural landscape or amongst buildings, such as industrial ruins, are carefully researched for distinctive backgrounds for each composition and [[LED]]-lamps are often used for contrasting cold and warm light to emphasise the existing structures. Collaboration is usually required in the performance of the work, with one person creating light figures and structures while the other operates the camera. In collaboration with Jörg Miedza, JanLeonardo founded the project LAPP-PRO.de that further developed the technique until in 2011, the pair disassociated. LAPP has grown internationally since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview |url=http://cpn.canon-europe.com/content/interviews/light_art_performance_photography.do |date=February 2009 |website=Canon Professionell Network |publisher=Canon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Techniques ==
[[File:Light painting screw.jpg|thumb|right|''Light Painting Screw'', by Karsten Knöfler]]
Light painting using handheld lights to selectively illuminate or colour parts of the subject or scene or to evenly light large architectural interiors has been used in professional photography since the 1930s as described by Leslie Walker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Walker, Leslie C | title=The technique of painting with light | publication-date=1940 | publisher=The Nash-Jones publishing company | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/32824743 | accessdate=17 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ansel Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Adams, Ansel | author2=Baker, Robert | publisher=New York Graphic Society | title=The negative | publication-date=1981 | edition= 1st | page= 174| isbn=978-0-8212-1131-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Light painting requires a slow [[shutter speed]], usually at least a second in duration. Light painting can imitate characteristics of traditional painting; superimposition and transparency can easily be achieved by moving, adding or removing lights or subjects during or between exposures.

Projector light painting, by waving a white translucent flash diffuser in the light path of a portable projector, the continuous motion creates a invisible screen in air for the projected image in the photo.

Light paintings can be created using a [[webcam]].{{Clarify|clarification needed=|date=March 2016}} The painted image can already be seen while drawing by using a monitor or projector. Another technique is the projection of images on to irregular surfaces (such as faces or buildings), in effect "painting" them with light.  A photograph or other fixed portrayal of the resulting image is then made.

Kinetic light painting is achieved by moving the camera, and is the antithesis of traditional photography. At night, or in a dark room, the camera can be removed from the tripod and used like a [[paintbrush]]. An example is using the night sky as the canvas, the camera as the brush and artificially-lit cityscapes as the palette. Putting energy into moving the camera by stroking lights,{{clarify|date=October 2014}} making patterns and laying down backgrounds can create abstract artistic images.

== Equipment ==
[[File:Wikimedia-2306.jpg|thumb|Light art performance photography: laser, LED and long time shot]]
A variety of light sources can be used, ranging from simple [[flashlight]]s to dedicated devices like the Hosemaster, which uses a [[fiber optic]] light pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://photo.net/learn/studio/primer | title=Studio Photography | first=Philip | last=Greenspun | date=January 2007 | publisher=Photo.net | accessdate=2007-09-26 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929104533/http://photo.net/learn/studio/primer | archivedate=2007-09-29 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources of light including candles, matches, fireworks, lighter flints, [[glowsticks]], and [[Poi (juggling)|poi]] are also popular.

A [[tripod (photography)|tripod]] is usually necessary due to the long exposure times involved. Alternatively, the camera may be placed on or braced against a table or other solid support. A [[Bulb (photography)|shutter release cable]] or [[self timer]] is generally employed in order to minimize camera shake. [[Color gel]]s can also be used to color the light sources.

Some light painters make their own dedicated devices to create light trails over the photo background; this can include computer-controlled devices like the Pixelstick. These devices are often Arduino-controlled LED arrays that can render images that could not be made by drawing in the air with a single light source alone. LED lights, [[Luminescence|luminescent]] materials, [[pyrotechnics]], [[fireworks]] and [[flashlight]]s are also used.

Note: The I is used in two distinct versions in Turkic languages, [[Dotted and dotless I|dotless (I ı) and dotted (İ i)]]. They are considered different letters, and case conversion must take care to preserve the distinction. Note that [[Irish alphabet|Irish]] traditionally does not write the dot, or [[tittle]], over the small letter ''i'', but the language makes no distinction here if a dot is displayed, so no specific encoding and special case conversion rule is needed like for Turkic alphabets.

====Statistics====
The chart above lists a variety of alphabets that do not officially contain all 26 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet. In this list, two letters are used by all of them: A and I. For each of the 26 basic ISO Latin alphabet letters, the number of alphabets in the list above using it is as follows:

==Letters not contained in the ISO basic Latin alphabet==
{{See also|List of Latin-script letters#Extensions|label 1=List of Latin-script letters: Extensions}}
Some languages have extended the Latin alphabet with [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], [[diacritic|modified letters]], or [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]. These symbols are listed below. The characters in the following tables may not all render, depending on which [[operating system]] and [[user agent|browser]] version are used, and the presence or absence of [[Unicode]] [[typeface|fonts]].

===Notes===
# &lt;span id="n-la"&gt;[[#r-la|↑]][[#r-la:1|↑]][[#r-la:2|↑]][[#r-la:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; In classical '''Latin''', the digraphs ''[[ch (digraph)|CH]]'', ''[[ph (digraph)|PH]]'', ''[[rh (digraph)|RH]]'', ''[[th (digraph)|TH]]'' were used in loanwords from [[Greek language|Greek]], but they were not included in the alphabet. The ligatures ''[[Æ]]'', ''[[Œ]]'' and ''[[W]]'', as well as lowercase letters, were added to the alphabet only in [[Middle Ages]]. The letters ''J'' and ''U'' were used as [[typography|typographical variants]] of ''I'' and ''V'', respectively, roughly until the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].
# &lt;span id="n-af"&gt;[[#r-af|↑]][[#r-af:1|↑]][[#r-af:2|↑]][[#r-af:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; In '''Afrikaans''', ''C'' and ''Q'' are only (and ''X'' and ''Z'' almost only) used in loanwords.
# &lt;span id="n-sq"&gt;[[#r-sq|↑]][[#r-sq:1|↑]][[#r-sq:2|↑]][[#r-sq:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Albanian''' officially has the digraphs ''dh, gj, ll, nj, rr, sh, th, xh, zh'', which is sufficient to represent the [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]] dialect.  The [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]] dialect supplements the official alphabet with 6 nasal vowels, namely â, ê, î, ô, û, ŷ.
# &lt;span id="n-aat"&gt;[[#r-aat|↑]][[#r-aat:1|↑]][[#r-aat:2|↑]][[#r-aat:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Arbëresh''' apparently requires the digraphs ''dh, gj, hj, ll, nj, rr, sh, th, xh, zh''.  Arbëresh has the distinctive hj, which is considered as a letter in its own right.
# &lt;span id="n-az"&gt;[[#r-az|↑]][[#r-az:1|↑]][[#r-az:2|↑]][[#r-az:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; A with diaeresis is used only as a replacement character for schwa if the latter cannot be used (it was replaced by the schwa one year later because it is the most common letter). These cases should be avoided!
# &lt;span id="n-eu"&gt;[[#r-eu|↑]][[#r-eu|↑]][[#r-eu:2|↑]][[#r-eu:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Basque''' has several digraphs: ''dd, ll, rr, ts, tt, tx, tz''.  The ü, which is pronounced as /ø/, is required for various words in its Zuberoan dialect. ''C, Ç, Q, V, W, Y'' are used in foreign words, but are officially considered part of the alphabet (except Ç, which is considered a variant of C).
# &lt;span id="n-bm"&gt;[[#r-bm|↑]] '''Bambara''' also has the digraphs: ''kh''(only present in loanwords), ''sh'' (also written as ''ʃ''; only present in some dialects). Historically, ''è'' was used instead of ''ɛ'', ''ny'' was used instead of ''ɲ'', and ''ò'' was used instead of ''ɔ'' in Mali
# &lt;span id="n-be"&gt;[[#r-be|↑]][[#r-be:1|↑]][[#r-be:2|↑]][[#r-be:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Belarusian''' also has several digraphs: ''ch, dz, dź, dž''.
# &lt;span id="n-bi"&gt;[[#r-bi|↑]][[#r-bi:1|↑]][[#r-bi:2|↑]][[#r-bi:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Bislama''' also has the digraph ''ng''.
# &lt;span id="n-br"&gt;[[#r-br|↑]][[#r-br:1|↑]][[#r-br:2|↑]][[#r-br:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Breton''' also has the digraphs ''ch, c'h, zh''. ''C, Q, X'' are used in foreign words or digraphs only.
# &lt;span id="n-ca"&gt;[[#r-ca:1|↑]][[#r-ca:2|↑]][[#r-ca:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Catalan''' also has a large number of digraphs: ''dj, gu, gü, ig, ix, ll, l·l, ny, qu, qü, rr, ss, tg, tj, ts, tx, tz''. The letters ''K'', ''Ñ'', ''Q'' ''W'', and ''Y'' are only used in loanwords or the digraphs mentioned.
# &lt;span id="n-ch"&gt;[[#r-ch|↑]][[#r-ch:1|↑]][[#r-ch:2|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Chamorro''' also has the digraphs ''ch, ng''. ''C'' used only in digraphs.
# &lt;span id="n-co"&gt;[[#r-co|↑]][[#r-co:1|↑]][[#r-co:2|↑]][[#r-co:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Corsican''' has the trigraphs: ''chj, ghj''.
# &lt;span id="n-hr"&gt;[[#r-hr|↑]][[#r-hr:1|↑]][[#r-hr|↑]][[#r-hr:3|↑]][[#r-sr|↑]][[#r-sr:1|↑]][[#r-sr|↑]][[#r-sr:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Croatian''' also has the digraphs: ''dž'', ''lj'', ''nj''. It can also be written with four tone markers above on top of the vowels. Note that Croatian Latin is the same as Serbian Latin and they both map 1:1 to [[Serbian Cyrillic]], where the three digraphs map to Cyrillic letters ''џ'', ''љ'' and ''њ'', respectively. Rarely and non-standardly, digraph ''dj'' is used instead of ''đ'' (Cyrillic ''ђ'').
# &lt;span id="n-acy"&gt;[[#r-acy|↑]][[#r-acy:1|↑]] &lt;/span&gt; '''Cypriot Arabic''' also has the letters ''Θ'' and ''Δ''.
# &lt;span id="n-cs"&gt;[[#r-cs|↑]][[#r-cs:1|↑]][[#r-cs:2|↑]][[#r-cs:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Czech''' also has the digraph ''ch'', which is considered a separate letter and is sorted between ''h'' and ''i''. While'' á, ď, é, ě, í, ň, ó, ť, ú, ů, ''and ''ý'' are considered separate letters, in collation they are treated merely as letters with diacritics. However, ''č, ř, š, ''and ž'' ''are actually sorted as separate letters. ''Q, W, X, Ö'' occur only in loanwords.
# &lt;span id="n-da"&gt;[[#r-da:1|↑]][[#r-da:2|↑]][[#r-da|↑]][[#r-no:1|↑]][[#r-no:2|↑]][[#r-no:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; The '''Norwegian''' alphabet is currently identical with the '''Danish''' alphabet. ''C'' is part of both alphabets and is not used in native Danish or Norwegian words (except some proper names), but occures quite frequently in well-established loanwords in Danish. Norwegian and Danish use é in some words such as ''én'', although é is considered a diacritic mark, while å, æ and ø are letters. ''Q, W, X, Z'' are not used except for names and some foreign words.
# &lt;span id="n-din"&gt;[[#r-din|↑]] '''Dinka''' also has the digraphs: ''dh'', ''nh'', ''ny'', ''th''. ''H'' is only present in these digraphs. Dinka also used the letters Ää, Ëë, Ïï, Öö, Ɛ̈ɛ̈, Ɔ̈ɔ̈ (the last two which do not exist as precomposed characters in Unicode)
# &lt;span id="n-nl"&gt;[[#r-nl:1|↑]][[#r-nl:2|↑]][[#r-nl:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; The status of ''[[IJ (letter)|ij]]'' as a letter, ligature or digraph in '''Dutch''' is disputed. ''C'' (outside the digraph ''ch'') ''Q'', ''X'', and ''Y'' occur mostly in foreign words. Letters with grave and letters with circumflex occur only in loanwords.
# &lt;span id="n-en"&gt;[[#r-en:1|↑]][[#r-en:2|↑]][[#r-en:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''English''' generally now uses extended Latin letters only in loan words, such as fiancé, fiancée, and résumé.  Rare publication guides may still use the dieresis on words, such as "coöperate", rather than the now-more-common "co-operate" (UK) or "cooperate" (US).  For a fuller discussion, see articles branching from [[Lists of English words of international origin]], which was used to determine the diacritics needed for more unambiguous English.  However, an ''é'' or ''è'' is sometimes used in poetry to show that a normally silent vowel is to be pronounced, as in "blessèd".
# &lt;span id="n-tl"&gt;[[#r-tl|↑]][[#r-tl:1|↑]][[#r-tl:2|↑]][[#r-tl:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Filipino''' also known as '''Tagalog''' also uses the digraph ''ng'', even originally with a large tilde that spanned both n and g (as in n͠g) when a vowel follows the digraph. (The use of the tilde over the two letters is now rare). Only ñ is required for everyday use (only in loanwords). The accented vowels are used in dictionaries to indicate pronunciation, g with tilde is only present in older works.
# &lt;span id="n-fr"&gt;[[#r-fr:1|↑]][[#r-fr:2|↑]][[#r-fr:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; Uppercase diacritics in '''French''' are often (incorrectly) thought of as being optional, but the official rules of French orthography designate accents on uppercase letters as obligatory in most cases. Many pairs or triplets are read as digraphs or trigraphs depending on context, but are not treated as such lexicographically: consonants ''ph, (ng), th, gu/gü, qu, ce, ch/(sh/sch), rh''; vocal vowels ''(ee), ai/ay, ei/ey, eu, au/eau, ou''; nasal vowels ''ain/aim, in/im/ein, un/um/eun, an/am, en/em, om/on''; the half-consonant ''-(i)ll-''; half-consonant and vowel pairs ''oi, oin/ouin, ien, ion''. When rules that govern the French orthography are not observed, they are read as separate letters, or using an approximating phonology of a foreign language for loan words, and there are many exceptions. In addition, most final consonants are mute (including those consonants that are part of feminine, plural, and conjugation endings). Y with diaeresis and U with diaeresis are only used in certain geographical names and proper names plus their derivatives, or, in the case of U with diaeresis, newly proposed reforms. Eg. capharnaüm `shambles' is derived from the proper name Capharnaüm. ''Æ'' occurs only in Latin or Greek loanwords.
# &lt;span id="n-ff"&gt;[[#r-ff|↑]] '''Fula''' has ''X'' as part of the alphabet in all countries except Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (used only in loanwords in these countries). ''Ɠ'', which is used only in loanwords (but still part of the alphabet), is used in Guinea only. Fula also uses the digraphs ''mb'' (In Guinea spelled ''nb''), ''nd'', ''ng'', and ''nj''. ''aa'', ''ee'', ''ii'', ''oo'', and ''uu'' are part of the alphabet in all countries except Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. ''Ƴ'' is used in all countries except for Nigeria, where it is written ''('y)''. ''Ŋ'' is used in all countries except for Nigeria. ''Ɲ'' is used in Guinea, Mali, and Burkina Faso, ''Ñ'' is used in Senegal, Gambia, Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, and the digraph ''ny'' is used in Niger, Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic, and Nigeria. The apostrophe is a letter (representing the glottal stop) in Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.
# &lt;span id="n-gl"&gt;[[#r-gl|↑]][[#r-gl|↑]][[#r-gl|↑]][[#r-gl|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Galician'''. The standard of 1982 set also the digraphs ''gu'', ''qu'' (both always before ''e'' and ''i''), ''ch, ll, nh'' and ''rr''. In addition, the standard of 2003 added the grapheme ''ao'' as an alternative writing of ''ó''. Although not marked (or forgotten) in the list of digraphs, they are used to represent the same sound, so the sequence ''ao'' should be considered as a digraph. Note also that ''nh'' represents a [[velar]] nasal (not a [[palatal]] as in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) and is restricted only to three feminine words, being either [[demonstrative]] or [[pronoun]]: ''unha'' ('a' and 'one'), ''algunha'' ('some') and ''ningunha'' ('not one'). The Galician ''[[reintegracionismo]]'' movement uses it as in Portuguese.
# &lt;span id="n-de"&gt;[[#r-de|↑]][[#r-de:1|↑]][[#r-de:2|↑]][[#r-de:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''German''' also retains most original letters in French loan words. Swiss German does not use ''ß'' any more. The [[long s]] ''(ſ)'' was in use until the mid-20th century. ''Sch'' is usually not treated like a true trigraph, neither are ''ch'', ''ck'', ''st'', ''sp'', ''th'', (''ph'', ''rh'')'' and ''qu'' digraphs. ''Q'' only appears in the sequence ''qu'' and in loanwords, while ''x'' and ''y'' are found almost only in loan words. The capital ''ß'' (''ẞ'') is almost never used, ''ß'' is replaced with ''SS'' when writing all-caps. The accented letters (other than the letters ''ä'', ''ö'', ''ü'', and ''ß'') are used only in loanwords.
# &lt;span id="n-gn"&gt;[[#r-gn|↑]][[#r-gn:1|↑]][[#r-gn:2|↑]][[#r-gn:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Guaraní''' also uses digraphs ''ch, mb, nd, ng, nt, rr'' and the glottal stop '' ' ''. ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' are only used in these digraphs.
# &lt;span id="n-ha"&gt;[[#r-ha|↑]][[#r-ha:1|↑]][[#r-ha:2|↑]][[#r-ha:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Hausa''' has the digraphs: ''sh, ts''. Vowel length and tone are usually not marked. Textbooks usually use macron or doubled vowel to mark the length, grave to mark the low tone and circumflex to mark the falling tone. Therefore, in some systems, it is possible that macron is used in combination with grave or circumflex over a, e, i, o or u.
# &lt;span id="n-hu"&gt;[[#r-hu|↑]][[#r-hu:1|↑]][[#r-hu:2|↑]][[#r-hu:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Hungarian''' also has the digraphs: ''cs, dz, gy, ly, ny, sz, ty, zs''; and the trigraph: ''dzs''. Letters ''á, é, í, ó, ő, ú, ''and ''ű'' are considered separate letters, but are collated as variants of a, e, i, o, ö, u, and ü.
# &lt;span id="n-ga"&gt;[[#r-ga|↑]][[#r-ga:1|↑]][[#r-ga:2|↑]][[#r-ga:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Irish''' formerly used the dot diacritic in ''ḃ, ċ, ḋ, ḟ, ġ, ṁ, ṗ, ṡ, ṫ''. These have been replaced by the digraphs: ''bh, ch, dh, fh, gh, mh, ph, sh, th'' except for in formal instances. ''V'' only occurs in onomotopoeia, such as ''vácarnach'', ''vác'', or ''vrác'', or in rare alternative spellings ''víog'' and ''vís'' (usually spelled ''bíog'' and ''bís''), or in loanwords. ''Z'' only occurs in the West Muskerry dialect in the digraph ''zs'' (a rare eclipsis of s, spelled s in other dialects and the language proper) or in loanwords.
# &lt;span id="n-ig"&gt;[[#r-ig|↑]] '''Igbo''' writes Ṅṅ alternatively as N̄n̄. Igbo has the digraphs: ''ch, gb, gh, gw, kp, kw, nw, ny, sh''. ''C'' is only used in the digraph before. Also, vowels take a grave accent, an acute accent, or no accent, depending on tone.
# &lt;span id="n-it"&gt;[[#r-it|↑]][[#r-it:1|↑]][[#r-it:2|↑]][[#r-it:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Italian''' also has the digraphs: ''ch, gh, gn, gl, sc''. J, K, W, X, Y are used in foreign words. X is also used for native words derived from Latin and Greek; J is also used for just a few native words, mainly names of persons (as in Jacopo) or of places (as in [[Jesolo]] and [[Jesi]]), in which is always pronounced as letter I. While it does not occur in ordinary running texts, geographical names on maps are often written only with acute accents. The circumflex is used on an -i ending that was anciently written -ii (or -ji, -ij, -j, etc.) to distinguish homograph plurals and verb forms: e.g. e.g. principî form principi, genî from geni.
# &lt;span id="n-kaa"&gt;[[#r-kaa|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Karakalpak''' also has the digraphs: ''ch, sh''. ''A', G', I', N', O', U''' are considered as letters. ''C, F, V'' are used in foreign words.
# &lt;span id="n-kk"&gt;[[#r-kk|↑]] '''Kazakh''' also has the digraphs: ''ıa, ıo, ıý''. ''C, F, H, V'' and the digraphs ''ch'' and ''ıo'' are used in foreign words.
# &lt;span id="n-lv"&gt;[[#r-lv|↑]][[#r-lv:1|↑]][[#r-lv:2|↑]][[#r-lv:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Latvian''' also has the digraphs: ''dz, dž, ie.'' ''Dz'' and ''dž'' are occasionally considered separate letters of the alphabet in more archaic examples, which have been published as recently as the 1950s; however, modern alphabets and teachings discourage this due to an ongoing effort to set decisive rules for Latvian and eliminate barbaric words accumulated during the Soviet occupation. The digraph "ie" is never considered a separate letter. ''Ō'', ''Ŗ'', and the digraphs ''CH'' (only used in loanwords) and ''UO'' are no longer part of the alphabet, but are still used in certain dialects and newspapers that use the old orthography. ''Y'' is used only in certain dialects and not in the standard language. ''F'' and ''H'' are only used in loanwords.
# &lt;span id="n-ls"&gt;[[#r-ls|↑]][[#r-ls:1|↑]][[#r-ls:2|↑]][[#r-ls:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; A nearby language, '''Pite Sami''', uses '''Lule Sami''' orthography but also includes the letter '''Đđ''', which is not in Lule Sami.
# &lt;span id="n-lt"&gt;[[#r-lt|↑]][[#r-lt:1|↑]][[#r-lt:2|↑]][[#r-lt:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Lithuanian''' also has the digraphs: ''ch, dz, dž, ie, uo''. However, these are not considered separate letters of the alphabet. ''F'', ''H'', and the digraph ''CH'' are only used in loanwords. Demanding publications such as dictionaries, maps, schoolbooks etc need additional diacritical marks to differentiate homographs.Using grave accent on A, E, I, O, U, acute accent on all vowels, and tilde accent on all vowels and on L, M, N and R. Small E and I (also with ogonek) must retain the dot when additional accent mark is added to the character; the use of ì and í (note the missing dot) is considered unacceptable.
# &lt;span id="n-liv"&gt;[[#r-liv|↑]][[#r-liv:1|↑]][[#r-liv:2|↑]][[#r-liv:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; In '''Livonian''', the letters ''Ö, Ȫ, Y, Ȳ'' were used by the older generation, but the younger generation merged these sounds; Around the late 1990's, these letters were removed from the alphabet.
# &lt;span id="n-mt"&gt;[[#r-mh|↑]][[#r-mh:1|↑]][[#r-mh:2|↑]][[#r-mh:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Marshallese''' often uses the old orthography (because people did not approve of the new orthography), which writes ''ļ'' as l, ''m̧'' as m, ''ņ'' as n, ''p'' as b, ''o̧'' as o at the ends of words or in the word ''yokwe'' (also spelled iakwe under the old orthography; under the new orthography, spelled io̧kwe), but a at other places, and ''d'' as dr before vowels, or r after vowels. The old orthography writes ''ā'' as e in some words, but ā in others; it also writes ''ū'' as i between consonants. The old orthography writes geminates and long vowels as two letters instead. Allophones of {{IPA|/ɘ/}}, written as only e o ō in the new orthography, are also written as i u and very rarely, ū. The letter ''Y'' only occurs in the words ''yokwe'' or the phrase ''yokwe yuk'' (also spelled iakwe iuk in the old orthography or io̧kwe eok in the new orthography).
# &lt;span id="n-mt"&gt;[[#r-mt|↑]][[#r-mt:1|↑]][[#r-mt:2|↑]][[#r-mt:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Maltese''' also has the digraphs: ''ie, għ''.
# &lt;span id="n-mi"&gt;[[#r-mi|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Māori''' uses ''g'' only in ''ng'' digraph. ''Wh'' is also a digraph.
# &lt;span id="n-moh"&gt;[[#r-moh|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; Some '''Mohawk''' speakers use orthographic ''i'' in place of the consonant ''y''. The glottal stop is indicated with an apostrophe ''’'' and long vowels are written with a colon '':''.
# &lt;span id="n-mis"&gt;[[#r-mis|↑]] '''[Na'vi]''' uses the letters ''~'' and ''ʼ'' and the digraphs ''aw'', ''ay'', ''ew'', ''ey'', ''kx'', ''ll'', ''ng'' (sometimes written as ''G''), ''px'', ''rr'', ''ts'' (sometimes written as ''C''), ''tx''. ''G'' (in standard orthography) and ''X'' used only in digraphs.
# &lt;span id="n-pms"&gt;[[#r-pms:1|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Piedmontese''' also uses the letter ''n-'' to indicate a velar nasal N-sound (pronounced as the gerundive termination in going), which usually precedes a vowel, as in lun-a [moon].
# &lt;span id="n-pinyin"&gt;[[#r-pinyin|↑]][[#r-pinyin:1|↑]][[#r-pinyin:2|↑]][[#r-pinyin:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Pinyin''' has four tone markers that can go on top of any of the six vowels ''(a, e, i, o, u, ü)''; e.g.: macron ''(ā, ē, ī, ō, ū, ǖ)'', acute accent ''(á, é, í, ó, ú, ǘ)'', caron ''(ǎ, ě, ǐ, ǒ, ǔ, ǚ)'', grave accent ''(à, è, ì, ò, ù, ǜ)''. It also uses the digraphs: ''ch, sh, zh''.
# &lt;span id="n-pl"&gt;[[#r-pl|↑]][[#r-pl:1|↑]][[#r-pl:2|↑]][[#r-pl:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Polish''' also has the digraphs: ''ch, cz, dz, dż, dź, sz, rz''.
# &lt;span id="n-pt"&gt;[[#r-pt|↑]][[#r-pt:1|↑]][[#r-pt:2|↑]][[#r-pt:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Portuguese''' also uses the digraphs ''ch, lh, nh, rr, ss''. The [[Umlaut (diacritic)|trema]] on ''ü'' was used in [[Brazilian Portuguese]] before 2009. The grave accent was used on e, i, o, and u, until 1973. The letters ''è''and ''ò'' are used in geographical names outside Europe and not part of the language proper. The now abandoned practice was to indicate underlying stress in words ending in -mente -- sòmente, ùltimamente etc. Neither the digraphs nor accented letters are considered part of the alphabet.
# &lt;span id="n-ro"&gt;[[#r-ro|↑]] '''Romanian''' normally uses a [[comma (diacritic)|comma]] diacritic below the letters ''s'' and ''t'' (''ș, ț''), but it is frequently replaced with an attached [[cedilla]] below these letters (''ş, ţ'') due to past lack of standardization. ''K'', ''Q'', ''W'', ''X'', and ''Y'' occur only in loanwords.
# &lt;span id="n-rom"&gt;[[#r-rom|↑]][[#r-rom:1|↑]][[#r-rom|↑]][[#r-rom:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Romani''' has the digraphs: ''čh, dž, kh, ph, th''.
# &lt;span id="n-sk"&gt;[[#r-sk:1|↑]][[#r-sk:2|↑]][[#r-sk:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Slovak''' also has the digraphs ''dz, dž,'' and'' ch,'' which are considered separate letters. While'' á, ä, ď, é, í, ĺ, ň, ó, ô, ŕ, ť, ú, ''and ''ý'' are considered separate letters, in collation they are treated merely as letters with diacritics. However, ''č, ľ, š, ''and ''ž'', as well as the digraphs,'' ''are actually sorted as separate letters. ''Q, W, X, Ě, Ö, Ř, Ü'' occur only in loanwords.
# &lt;span id="n-es"&gt;[[#r-es:1|↑]][[#r-es:2|↑]][[#r-es:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Spanish''' uses several digraphs to represent single sounds: ''ch'', ''gu'' (preceding ''e'' or ''i''), ''ll'', ''qu'', ''rr''; of these, the digraphs ''[[ch (digraph)|ch]]'' and ''[[ll]]'' were traditionally considered individual letters with their own name (''che'', ''elle'') and place in the alphabet (after ''c'' and ''l'', respectively), but in order to facilitate international compatibility the [[Real Academia Española|Royal Spanish Academy]] decided to cease this practice in 1994 and all digraphs are now collated as combinations of two separate characters. While cedilla is etymologically Spanish diminutive of ceda (z) and Sancho Pança is the original form in Cervantes books, C with cedilla ''ç'' is now completely displaced by z in contemporary language. In poetry, the diaeresis may be used to break a diphthong into separate vowels. Regarding that usage, Ortografía de la lengua española states that "diaeresis is usually placed over the closed vowel [i.e. 'i' or 'u'] and, when both are closed, generally over the first". In this context, the use of ï is rare, but part of the normative orthography.
# &lt;span id="n-sv"&gt;[[#r-sv|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Swedish''' uses é in well integrated loan words like ''[[idea|idé]]'' and ''[[army|armé]]'', although é is considered a modified e, while å, ä, ö are letters. á and à are rarely used words. W and z are used in some integrated words like [[World Wide Web|webb]] and [[wikt:zone|zon]]. Q, ü, è, and ë are used for names only, but exist in Swedish names. For foreign names ó, ç, ñ and more are sometimes used, but usually not. Swedish has many digraphs and some trigraphs. ''ch'', ''dj'', ''lj'', ''rl'', ''rn'', ''rs'', ''sj'', ''sk'', ''si'', ''ti'', ''sch'', ''skj'', ''stj'' and others are usually pronounced as one sound.
# &lt;span id="n-aeb"&gt;[[#r-aeb:1|↑]][[#r-aeb:2|↑]][[#r-aeb:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Tunisian Arabic''' also uses the digraph: ''għ''. Usually Tunisian Arabic is written in the Arabic script; this Latin alphabet, which is based on Maltese, was not created until 2015.
# &lt;span id="n-tn"&gt;[[#r-tn|↑]][[#r-tn:1|↑]][[#r-tn:2|↑]][[#r-tn:3|↑]] '''Tswana''' also has the digraphs: ''kg, kh, ng, ph, th, tl, tlh, ts, tsh, tš, tšh''. The letters ''C'', ''Q'', and ''X'' only appear in onomotopeia and loanwords. The letters ''V'' and ''Z'' only appear in loanwords.
# &lt;span id="n-tk"&gt;[[#r-tk|↑]][[#r-tk:1|↑]][[#r-tk:2|↑]][[#r-tk:3|↑]] '''Turkmen''' had a slightly different alphabet before 1993 (which used some unusual letters) ''Ýý'' was written as ''¥ÿ'', ''Ňň'' was written as ''Ññ'', and ''Şş'' was written as ''$¢'', and ''Žž'' was written ''£⌠'' (so that all  characters were available in [[Code page 437]]). In the new alphabet, all characters are available in [[ISO/IEC 8859-2]].
# &lt;span id="n-ult"&gt;[[#r-uli|↑]][[#r-uli:1|↑]][[#r-uli:2|↑]] '''Ulithian''' also has the digraphs: ''ch'', ''[l']'', ''mw'', ''ng''. ''C'' used only in digraphs.
# &lt;span id="n-uz"&gt;[[#r-uz|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Uzbek''' also has the digraphs: ''ch, ng, sh'' considered as letters. ''C'' used only in digraphs. ''G&amp;#39;, O&amp;#39;'' and apostrophe (') are considered as letters. These letters have preferred typographical variants: Gʻ, Oʻ and ʼ respectively.
# &lt;span id="n-ve"&gt;[[#r-ve|↑]][[#r-ve:1|↑]][[#r-ve:2|↑]][[#r-ve:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Venda''' also has the digraphs and trigraphs: ''bv, bw, dz, dzh, dzw, fh, hw, kh, khw, ng, ny, nz, ṅw, ph, pf, pfh, sh, sw, th, ts, tsh, tsw, ty, ṱh, vh, zh, zw. ''C, J, Q'' are used in foreign words.
# &lt;span id="n-vi"&gt;[[#r-vi|↑]][[#r-vi:1|↑]][[#r-vi:2|↑]][[#r-vi:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Vietnamese''' has seven additional base letters: ''ă â đ ê ô ơ ư''. It uses five tone markers that can go on top (or below) any of the 12 vowels ''(a, ă, â, e, ê, i, o, ô, ơ, u, ư, y)''; e.g.: grave accent ''(à, ằ, ầ, è, ề, ì, ò, ồ, ờ, ù, ừ, ỳ)'', hook above ''(ả, ẳ, ẩ, ẻ, ể, ỉ, ỏ, ổ, ở, ủ, ử, ỷ)'', tilde ''(ã, ẵ, ẫ, ẽ, ễ, ĩ, õ, ỗ, ỡ, ũ, ữ, ỹ)'', acute accent ''(á, ắ, ấ, é, ế, í, ó, ố, ớ, ú, ứ, ý)'', and dot below ''(ạ, ặ, ậ, ẹ, ệ, ị, ọ, ộ, ợ, ụ, ự, ỵ)''. It also uses several digraphs and trigraphs{{spaced ndash}} ''ch, gh, gi, kh, ng, ngh, nh, ph, th, tr''{{spaced ndash}} but they are no longer considered letters.
# &lt;span id="n-wa"&gt;[[#r-wa|↑]][[#r-wa:1|↑]][[#r-wa:2|↑]][[#r-wa:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Walloon''' has the digraphs and trigraphs: ''ae, ch, dj, ea, jh, oe, oen, oi, sch, sh, tch, xh''. The letter ''X'' outside the digraph ''xh'' is in some orthographies, but not the default two. The letter ''Q'' is in some orthographies (including one default orthography), but not in the other default orthography. Also in some orthographies are ''À'', ''Ì'', ''Ù'', ''Ë, ''Ö'', and even ''E̊'' (which is not available as a precomposed character in Unicode)
# &lt;span id="n-cy"&gt;[[#r-cy|↑]][[#r-cy:1|↑]][[#r-cy:2|↑]][[#r-cy:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Welsh''' has the digraphs ''ch'', ''dd'', ''ff'', ''ng'', ''ll'', ''ph'', ''rh'', ''th''. Each of these digraphs is collated as a separate letter, and ''ng'' comes immediately after ''g'' in the alphabet. It also frequently uses [[circumflex]]es, and occasionally uses [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaereses]], [[acute accent]]s and [[grave accent]]s, on its seven vowels (''a'', ''e'', ''i'', ''o'', ''u'', ''w'', ''y''), but accented characters are not regarded as separate letters of the alphabet.
# &lt;span id="n-xh"&gt;[[#r-xh|↑]][[#r-xh:1|↑]][[#r-xh:2|↑]][[#r-xh:3|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Xhosa''' has a large number of digraphs, trigraphs, and even one tetragraph are used to represent various phonemes: ''bh, ch, dl, dy, dz, gc, gq, gr, gx, hh, hl, kh, kr, lh, mb, mf, mh, nc, ndl, ndz, ng, ng', ngc, ngh, ngq, ngx, nh, nkc, nkq, nkx, nq, nx, ntl, ny, nyh, ph, qh, rh, sh, th, ths, thsh, ts, tsh, ty, tyh, wh, xh, yh, zh''. It also occasionally uses [[acute accent]]s, [[grave accent]]s, [[circumflex]]es, and [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaereses]] on its five vowels ''(a, e, i, o, u)'', but accented characters are not regarded as separate letters of the alphabet.
# &lt;span id="n-ya"&gt;[[#r-ya|↑]][[#r-ya:1|↑]][[#r-ya:2|↑]]&lt;/span&gt; '''Yapese''' has the digraphs and trigraphs: ''aa, ae, ch, ea, ee, ii, [k'], [l'], [m'], [n'], ng, [ng'], oe, oo, [p'], [t'], th, [th'], uu, [w'], [y']''. ''Q'', representing the glottal stop, is not used. Often an apostrophe is used to represent the glottal stop instead. ''C'' used only in digraphs. ''H'' used only in digraphs and loanwords. ''J'' used only in loanwords.
# &lt;span id="n-yo"&gt;'''Yoruba''' uses the digraph ''gb''. Also, vowels take a grave accent, an acute accent, or no accent, depending on tone. Although the "dot below" diacritic is widely used, purists prefer a short vertical underbar (Unicode COMBINING VERTICAL LINE BELOW U+0329) - this resembles the IPA notation for a syllabic consonant, attached to the base of the letter (E, O or S). The seven Yoruba vowels (A, E, E underbar, I, O, O underbar, U) can be uttered in three different tones: high (acute accent); middle (no accent) and low (grave accent). The letters M and N, when written without diacritics, indicate nasalisation of the preceding vowel. M and N also occur as syllabics - in these circumstances, they take acute or grave tonal diacritics, like the vowels. Middle tone is marked with a macron to differentiate it from the unmarked nasalising consonants. A tilde was used in older orthography (still occasionally used) to indicate a double vowel. This is tonally ambiguous, and has now been replaced by showing the paired vowels, each marked with the appropriate tones.
However, where a double vowel has the tonal sequence high-low or low-high, it may optionally be replaced by a single vowel with a circumflex (high-low) or caron (low-high), eg. á + à = â; à + á = ǎ.

He recorded his political [[chanson]]s in both French and in Creole. He lived abroad in exile twice, both during the 1980s and again during the years 1991–1994, when the country was ruled by a military ''[[military junta|junta]]'' led by [[Raoul Cédras]]. 

==Early life==
Charlemagne grew up in [[Carrefour, Haiti|Carrefour]], to the south of the capital of [[Port-au-Prince]], where he was influenced as much by the songs of the peasants who moved into the area in search of a livelihood, as by his Catholic school choir. Raised by his aunt, he did not know who is father was until he was 37 years old.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Political career==
In 1986, after the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship, Charlemagne  organized a youth group and choir in his old neighborhood, Carrefour. For a brief time following [[Bertrand Aristide]]'s landslide victory on 16 December 1990, Charlemagne found himself in the role of a government booster. He served as an unofficial minister in the Aristide cabinet, an assignment that ended abruptly nine months later, when a military junta overthrew Haiti's first freely elected president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.haitianbeatz.com/board/threads/singer-manno-charlemagne-undergoes-difficult-brain-cancer-operation-in-miami.15161 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213010719/http://www.haitianbeatz.com/board/threads/singer-manno-charlemagne-undergoes-difficult-brain-cancer-operation-in-miami.15161/ |archive-date=2017-12-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 11 October, a truckload of troops pulled up to his home, roughed him up in front of his family, and hauled him off to jail. His wife, Chantel, went into hiding with the couple's baby son, Ti-Manno, and later fled to the island of [[Guadeloupe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/content/printVersion/233748|title=Manno Charlemagne|date=January 29, 1992|author=Steven Almond|work=[[Miami New Times]]|accessdate=November 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Charlemagne took up guitar and singing at the age of 16. By 1968, he had formed a band named ''Les Remarquables.''

'''Mary Anderson Grierson''' (27 September 1912 – 30 January 2012) was a Welsh-born Scottish botanical artist and illustrator. The youngest of three children to parents hailing from [[Dumfries]], she was encouraged by her mother to paint from an early age but preferred watercolour over oil. Grierson served in the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] as a flight officer in a photographic reconnaissance unit and used the skills she learnt into use later in her life. She joined [[De Havilland]]'s public relations department after demobilisation and moved to [[Hunting Aerosurveys Ltd|Hunting Aerosurveys]] in 1947. Grierson was sent on a week course in pen and ink drawing in Suffolk ten years later and returned there for another ten years after finding the experience fulfilling.

In 1960 she became employed by the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Royal Botanic Gardens]] in [[Kew]] as the [[Kew Gardens|Herbarium]]'s resident artist. Grierson later illustrated several books and had her work exhibited at various locations across the globe. She officially retired from Kew Gardens in 1972 to enable her to take up more private commissions. Grierson was the recipient of several medals, including the [[Victoria Medal of Honour]] by the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] in 1997.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Grierson was born on 27 September 1912 at Bodfaen, Craig Y Don Road, [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] in [[Caernarfonshire|Caernarvonshire]]. She was the youngest of three children of the laundry proprietor George Rae Grierson and his wife Anna, ''née'' Shortridge.&lt;ref name=OBNDentry&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=T. Prance|first=Ghillean|title=Grierson, Mary Anderson (1912–2012), botanical artist|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10481|encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|date=January 2016|accessdate=5 November 2017|subscription=yes|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/104812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of Grierson's parents came from [[Dumfries]].&lt;ref name="independentobituary"&gt;{{cite news|last=Desmond|first=Ray|title=Mary Grierson: Floral artist celebrated as one of the most distinguished in her field|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/mary-grierson-floral-artist-celebrated-as-one-of-the-most-distinguished-in-her-field-7466777.html|work=[[The Independent]]|date=1 March 2012|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna was an oil painter and encouraged Grierson to take up the same career from an early age. Grierson preferred [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]] over [[Oil painting|oil]] as she disliked the smell that comes from oils.&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries: Mary Grierson|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/art-obituaries/9134740/Mary-Grierson.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=9 March 2012|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was educated at the Bangor County School for Girls and later claimed at the school she did not enjoy all subjects apart from art and botany of which she excelled.&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt; Grierson chose not to attend university,&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary" /&gt; but was awarded the diploma of the [[Royal Drawing Society]] in London in 1930,&lt;ref name="walesonlineobituary"&gt;{{cite news|last=Devine|first=Darren|title=Artist Mary Grierson inspired by Kew Gardens dies at 99|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/artist-mary-grierson-inspired-kew-2033511|work=WalesOnline|date=2 March 2012|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which confirmed her talent for the first time.&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt;

She spent 1931 teaching English to a German family but returned home to study at [[University of Surrey|Battersea Polytechnic]] and found employment as a confectioner in [[Llandudno]]. Her parents became ill and this induced Grierson to return home and care for them. Following the death of her father, she and her mother relocated to Dumfries where she managed a local restaurant.&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt; When World War II broke out,&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary" /&gt; Grierson served in the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] as a flight officer in a photographic reconnaissance unit,&lt;ref name="walesonlineobituary" /&gt; and was based at [[Medmenham]] in [[Buckinghamshire]].&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary" /&gt; Her work saw her examine aerial photographs taken after British air raids in Germany to assess what damage had been done. Grierson's job required good vision and heavy concentration which she put to use later in life.&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt;

===Career===
After demobilisation, Grierson joined [[De Havilland]]'s public relations department and was put in charge of photographs.&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt; In 1947, she moved to [[Hunting Aerosurveys Ltd|Hunting Aerosurveys]],&lt;ref name="OBNDentry" /&gt; a company that produced maps from aerial photographs.&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary" /&gt; Hunting Aerosurveys sent Grierson on a week's course in pen and ink drawing at the Flatford Mill Field Centre in [[Suffolk]] ten years later.&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary" /&gt; She found the experience so fulfilling and returned to come under the mentorship of the painter John Nash for the next ten years.&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="walesonlineobituary" /&gt; Grierson applied for the vacancy of exhibitions officer at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Royal Botanic Gardens]] in [[Kew]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt; She showed a portfolio of her work to her interviewer, Edgar Milne-Redhead, the deputy keeper of the [[Kew Gardens|Kew Herbarium]]. Milne-Redhead took one of her paintings and suggested to Grierson that she would be better off working as the Herbarium's resident artist.&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary" /&gt;

In 1966, she won her first gold medal for flower painting from the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] (RHS),&lt;ref name="womeninscience"&gt;{{cite book|last=M. C. Haines|first=Catharine|title=International Women in Science: A Biographical Dictionary to 1950|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HftdjMNDvwIC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=Mary+Grierson&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=chXBMlSYi-&amp;sig=KkjzEMZcBP4n1dnexShRTuThXyQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrqKPznqfXAhWF0xoKHYRcAs04FBDoAQgvMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Mary%20Grierson&amp;f=false|year=2001|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|location=[[Santa Barbara, California]]|page=119|isbn=978-1-57607-090-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was invited to contribute designs for two postage stamps for the [[Post Office Ltd|Post Office]] the next year: a primrose for the 9d and a violet for the 1s.9d.&lt;ref name="OBNDentry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt; The first book Grierson illustrated came in 1967 which was [[Anthony Julian Huxley]]'s ''Mountain Flowers''.&lt;ref name="OBNDentry" /&gt; A further gold medal was awarded to her in 1969.&lt;ref name="womeninscience" /&gt; The Israeli Nature Authority commissioned her to paint the flora of the Negev and Sinai deserts in 1970. Grierson retired from Kew in 1972 and this enabled her to accept more private commissions. These works included a series of paintings of endangered plants for the archives of the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and a major series of tulip drawings for the Van Tubergen Nurseries at [[Haarlem]] that were later purchased by Kew Gardens.&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt; In 1973,&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary" /&gt; she was invited to go to Hawaii to create a record of plants at the [[National Tropical Botanical Garden]].&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt;

Grierson's paintings began to be exhibited in the same year at the International Exhibition of Botanical Art in [[Johannesburg]] and [[Cape Town]]. In 1975, her paintings were put on display at the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation in [[Pittsburgh]], and she illustrated her second book that same year, ''Trees and Shrubs of the British Isles'' by William Bean. Grierson had her first of seven solo exhibitions at [[Spink &amp; Son]] in 1978.&lt;ref name="OBNDentry" /&gt; Starting from 1966, she had been teaching a course at Kew but ended this in 1983.&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt; Grierson received the RHS's Gold Veitch Memorial Medal the following year.&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary" /&gt; Her work was further exhibited at the Pacific Tropical Botanical Garden in 1984 and received an honorary [[Master of Philosophy]] degree from the [[University of Reading]] two years later. Grierson illustrated Brian Mathew's ''Hellebores'' in 1989 and earned a silver medal at the 1990 International Book Art Exhibition in [[Leipzig]].&lt;ref name="OBNDentry" /&gt;

Her sole exhibition at Kew Gardens came in 1993 and her last exhibition at Spink &amp; Son followed in the next year.&lt;ref name="OBNDentry" /&gt; Grierson's work in Hawaii appeared in Peter Shaw Green's  ''A Hawaiian florilegium: botanical portraits from paradise'' in 1996 and was awarded the [[Victoria Medal of Honour]] by the RHS in 1997.&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary" /&gt;

===Later years and death===

She lived in Lynde House Care Home in [[Twickenham]] in her later years and suffered from impaired vision that was caused by macular degeneration.&lt;ref name="OBNDentry" /&gt; Grierson suffered a stroke on 26 December 2011,&lt;ref name="walesonlineobituary" /&gt; and died at Kingston Hospital from this on 30 January 2012. Her ashes were scattered on the mound of the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew. Grierson never married.&lt;ref name="OBNDentry" /&gt;

Louisville '''Memorial Auditorium''', located at 970 South Fourth Street, is a concert venue of [[Greek Revival]] design. It was dedicated on Memorial Day, May 30, 1929, as a memorial to the people of [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] who served in [[World War I]]. In 1954, the ceiling was lowered and the side balconies were closed off reducing the seating capacity from 2,349 to 1,742 to improve the acoustics.

Memorial Auditorium is home of the world's largest Pilcher organ and the largest operating theater organ in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louisville Organs - Louisville Memorial Auditorium|url=http://agolouisville.org/organ_detail.php?id=34&amp;pos=C|website=The American Guild of Organists - Louisville Chapter|publisher=Louisville AGO|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This historic four-manual instrument with 5,288 pipes has been in operation since opening. The acoustic renovation all but completely closed off the pipe chambers from the renovated hall. It has been designated a landmark by the [[Louisville Metro Landmarks Commission]] and is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

Although it is now used mainly by organizations for recitals, graduations, etc., it hosted many rock concerts in the 1960s and 1970s, including [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Chicago]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2015/04/01/fans-return-stone-age-concerts/70789248/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''monograph''' is a specialist work of writing (in contrast to [[reference work]]s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Campbell |first1=Robert |last2=Pentz |first2=Ed |last3=Borthwick |first3=Ian |date=2012 |title=Academic and Professional Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IpRlAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-1-78063-309-1 |quote='[M]onograph' has become a catch-all term for a book that is not of a reference type, that is of primary material}}.&lt;/ref&gt; on a single subject or an aspect of a subject, often by a single author, and usually on a scholarly subject. 

In library cataloging, ''monograph'' has a broader meaning, that of a nonserial publication complete in one [[Volume (bibliography)|volume]] (book) or a definite number of volumes. Thus it differs from a [[periodical publication|serial]] publication such as a [[magazine]], [[academic journal|journal]], or [[newspaper]].&lt;ref&gt;Prytherch, Raymond John, ''Harrod's librarians' glossary and reference book: a directory of over 10,200 terms, organizations, projects and acronyms in the areas of information management, library science, publishing and archive management'', 10th edn (Aldershot, Hants, England ; Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2005), p. 462.; "For the purpose of library cataloging, any nonserial publication, complete in one volume or intended to be completed in a finite number of parts issued at regular or irregular intervals, containing a single work or collection of works. Monographs are sometimes published in monographic series and subseries. Compare with book."[http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#monograph]&lt;/ref&gt; In this context only, books such as [[novel]]s are monographs.__FORCETOC__

== In academia ==
{{See also|Monographic series}}
The term "monographia" is derived from the Greek "mono" (single) and ''grapho'' (to write), meaning "writing on a single subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.phytojournal.com/archives/?year=2018&amp;vol=7&amp;issue=4&amp;ArticleId=5296&amp;si=false |title=Development of monograph and study of variation in chemical constituent of plant Balanites roxburghii |journal=Journal of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry |volume=7 |issue=4 |year=2018 |access-date=8 October 2018 |pages=2369-2371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a textbook, which surveys the state of knowledge in a field, the main purpose of a monograph is to present primary research and original scholarship ascertaining reliable credibility to the required recipient. This research is presented at length, distinguishing a monograph from an article. For these reasons, publication of a monograph is commonly regarded as vital for career progression in many academic disciplines. Intended for other researchers and bought primarily by libraries, monographs are generally published as individual volumes in a short print run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/00012530910932294 |title=The role and future of the monograph in arts and humanities research|journal=Aslib Proceedings |volume=61 |pages=67 |year=2009 |last1=Williams |first1=Peter |last2=Stevenson|first2=Iain|last3=Nicholas|first3=David|last4=Watkinson|first4=Anthony|last5=Rowlands|first5=Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain and the U.S., what differentiates a scholarly monograph from an academic trade title varies by publisher, though generally it is the assumption that the readership has not only specialized or sophisticated knowledge but also professional interest in the subject of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=John B. |title=Books in the Digital Age: The Transformation of Academic and Higher Education Publishing in Britain and the United States |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |year=2005 |isbn=978-0745634784 |pages=84-85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In art ==
Book publishers use the term "artist monograph" to indicate books dealing with a single artist, as opposed to broader surveys of art subjects.

== In biology ==

In biological taxonomy a monograph is a comprehensive treatment of a [[taxon]]. Monographs typically review all known species within a group, add any newly discovered species, and collect and synthesize available information on the ecological associations, geographic distributions, and morphological variations within the group. See this reference as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=|title=Revision of the Triatominae (Hemiptera, Reduviidae), and their significance as vectors of Chagas' disease |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/89400#/summary |journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History|volume=163|issue=3|pages=125-520|hdl=2246/1282 |author1=Lent, Herman |author2=Wygodzinsky, Pedro W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first-ever monograph of a plant taxon was [[Robert Morison]]'s 1672 ''Plantarum Umbelliferarum Distributio Nova'', a treatment of the [[Apiaceae]].&lt;ref name="Vines 1913"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Sydney Howard Vines|Vines, Sydney Howard]] | year = 1913 | chapter = Robert Morison 1620–1683 and John Ray 1627–1705 | editor = [[Francis Wall Oliver|Oliver, Francis Wall]] (ed.) | title = Makers of British Botany | publisher = Cambridge University Press | page = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In United States Food and Drug Administration regulation ==
{{See also|Pharmacopoeia}}
In the context of [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulation, monographs represent published standards by which the use of one or more substances is automatically authorized. For example, the following is an excerpt from the ''[[Federal Register]]'': "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a final rule in the form of a final monograph establishing conditions under which over-the-counter (OTC) sunscreen drug products are [[generally recognized as safe and effective]] and not misbranded as part of FDA's ongoing review of OTC drug products."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/052199b.txt |work=Federal Register|date= May 21, 1999 |volume= 64|number= 98 |series=Rules and Regulations |pages=27666–27693|title=DOCID:fr21my99-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such usage has given rise to the use of the word monograph as a verb, as in "this substance has been monographed by the FDA".

'''''My Sister's Keeper''''' is a 2009 American [[drama film]] directed by [[Nick Cassavetes]] and starring [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Abigail Breslin]], [[Sofia Vassilieva]], [[Jason Patric]], and [[Alec Baldwin]].

==Plot==
Kate Fitzgerald ([[Sofia Vassilieva]]) has [[acute promyelocytic leukemia]]. Conceived by [[in vitro fertilization]], her younger sister Anna ([[Abigail Breslin]]) was brought into the world as a [[Savior sibling|savior sister]]. She is a genetic match to her older sister and can donate compatible organs, blood, and tissue to help her. When Kate turns 15, she goes into [[renal failure]] and 11-year old Anna knows that she will be forced by her parents to donate one of her kidneys. She also realizes that she may not be able to live the life she wants to lead – she will not be able to play sports, drink alcohol, or be a mother in the future. Anna tells her parents that she does not want to be a donor and sues them for [[medical emancipation]] and the rights to her own body. Her father Brian ([[Jason Patric]]) understands her, though her domineering mother, Sara ([[Cameron Diaz]]), who leads an obsessive campaign to keep Kate alive, is indignant at her decision. Attorney Campbell Alexander ([[Alec Baldwin]]) agrees to work for Anna as her guardian [[ad litem]], suing for partial termination of [[Parents' rights movement|parental rights]]. He has agreed to take the case because he has [[epilepsy]], and is sympathetic to her predicament.

The film is interlaced with flashbacks that detail Kate and Anna's close relationship, as well as how Kate's illness has affected her siblings, including their brother, Jesse (Evan Ellingson). In a flashback, Kate meets a fellow cancer patient, Taylor Ambrose ([[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]]), whom she begins dating. He asks her to the hospital's prom for teen patients; there, they slow-dance, then have sex. A few days later, Kate begins to worry as she has not seen Taylor since the dance. She learns that Taylor has died and attempts suicide by overdosing on painkillers, but Anna stops her. Kate expresses hope that after she dies, she will see Taylor.

Kate makes a request to go to the beach one last time. Brian obtains permission and discharges her from the hospital for the day. Sara overreacts and demands that Kate be returned to the hospital immediately. Brian angrily refuses and threatens Sara with a divorce if she does not join them. Sara shows up at the beach, where they enjoy one final family outing.

During the hearing, Jesse reveals that Anna is actually acting under Kate's instruction; Kate, not wanting to live any longer, had persuaded Anna to refuse to donate her kidney. Anna had wanted to give Kate her kidney and had been upset at Kate's decision. Sara is finally forced to acknowledge what Kate has been trying to tell her all this time: she is ready to die. Later that day, Kate dies sleeping, with her mother by her side. After her death, Campbell states that Anna has won the case. The family moves on with their lives. Sara, who gave up practicing law to look after Kate, returns to work, Brian retires from firefighting and counsels troubled youths, and Jesse receives an arts scholarship in New York. Anna reveals that every year on Kate's birthday they go to [[Montana]], which was her "most favorite place in the world". She concludes that she was not born merely to save her sister, she was born because she had a sister, and that their relationship continues even in death.

==Production and cast changes==
Upon the original creation of the film adaptation, sisters [[Dakota Fanning]] and [[Elle Fanning]] were cast to play Kate and Anna respectively. However, when Dakota heard that she would be required to shave her head for the role, she dropped out of the film as then did Elle. The two sisters were replaced, with [[Abigail Breslin]] taking on the lead role as Anna Fitzgerald and [[Sofia Vassilieva]] on the role of Kate Fitzgerald.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dakota Fanning Steps Down From 'My Sister's Keeper' Role|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2008/02/13/dakota_fanning_steps_down_from_my_sister|publisher=Starpulse.com|accessdate=January 12, 2012|date=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''People’s Liberation Music''' (PLM) was a political music group, playing folk and agit-pop, founded in 1972 by [[Laurie Scott Baker]], [[John Marcangelo]] and [[John Tilbury]]. After Tilbury left in 1973 [[Cornelius Cardew]] and [[Keith Rowe]] joined with Vicky Silva as the main vocalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Keith Rowe|last=Olewnick|first=Brian|publisher=Powerhouse Books|year=2018|isbn=978-1576878644|location=|pages=223-227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other members included [[Hugh Shrapnel]], and [[Dave Smith (composer)|Dave Smith]]; among its many drummers were [[Pip Pyle]], John Mitchell, [[Back Door (jazz trio)|Tony Hicks]] and John Hewitt. After the group was dissolved in 1978 it was followed by the Progressive Cultural Association (PCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/eblj/2013articles/pdf/ebljarticle42013.pdf|title=Cornelius Cardew’s Music for Moving Images: Some Preliminary Observations|last=Gresser|first=Clemens|date=|website=The British Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pet cemetery''' is a [[cemetery]] for animals.

==History==
[[File:Hiran Minar- monument to Mansraj.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Hiran Minar]]'' near [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]] was built in the early 17th century by the [[Mughal empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Jahangir]] in honor of his beloved pet deer.]]
Many human cultures [[burial|buried]] animal remains. For example, the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians [[Mummy|mummified]] and buried [[cat]]s, which they considered [[deity|deities]], and [[Ashkelon dog cemetery|the largest known dog cemetery in the ancient world]] was discovered at the [[Ashkelon National Park]] in [[Ashkelon]], [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bib-arch.org/e-features/dogs-buried-at-ashkelon.asp |title=Why are hundreds of dogs buried at Ashkelon|website=bib-arch.org}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] was the site of an informal pet cemetery between 1881 and 1903, in the gatekeeper's garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funlondontours.com/news/victorian-pet-cemetery-hyde-park |title=The Victorian Pet Cemetery of Hyde Park|website=Fun London Tours}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the first burial of "Cherry" until its official closure in 1903, it received 300 burials with miniature headstones,&lt;ref&gt;[http://londoninsight.wordpress.com/2010/10/06/pet-cemetery-hyde-park/ The Pet Cemetery of Hyde Park] London insight Blog, 6 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; with a final special burial of the [[Royal Marines]] mascot dog "Prince" in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://london365.co.uk/hyde-park-pet-cemetery Hyde Park Pet Cemetery] London 365, 11 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Cimetière des Chiens]] in [[Asnières-sur-Seine]] in [[Paris, France|Paris]], dating from 1899, is an elaborate, sculpted pet cemetery believed to be one of the first public [[zoology|zoological]] [[necropolis]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostandfond.co.uk/news-features/2010-08/tour-parisian-pet-cemetery-cimetiere-du-chiens A tour of Parisian pet cemetery Cimetière des Chiens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222084040/http://www.lostandfond.co.uk/news-features/2010-08/tour-parisian-pet-cemetery-cimetiere-du-chiens |date=22 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

America's largest and oldest pet cemetery is in [[Hartsdale, New York]]. It dates from 1896, when a veterinarian working out of [[Manhattan]] offered to let a grieving pet owner bury her dog in his hillside apple orchard. Today, it is the final resting place for more than 70,000 animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostandfond.co.uk/news-features/2010-12/apple-orchard-became-new-yorks-famous-hartsdale-pet-cemtery Apple orchard that became New York's famous Hartsdale Pet Cemetery]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hartsdale Pet Cemetery]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/listings/20120824.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places Listings|date=2012-08-24|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 8/13/12 through 8/17/12 |publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other famous American pet cemeteries are Aspin Hill Memorial Park in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], where celebrity animals such as seven of [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s dogs, such as his Cairn terrier Spee De Bozo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/1827|work=Find a Grave|title=Spee De Bozo|accessdate=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and internees at the "Medical Rats Memorial" are buried. (General Grant of R.K.O. was rumored to be Petey of the Our Gang and Little Rascals movies, but this is not true);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Roadside America|url= http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/3626|title=Grave of a Petey, Little Rascals Dog|accessdate=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Pet Memorial Cemetery in [[Calabasas, CA]], where [[Hopalong Cassidy]]'s horse, Topper, [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Jack Russell Terrier]], and [[Rudolph Valentino]]'s dog, Kabar, are buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Roadside America|url= http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/3626|title=Grave of a Petey, Little Rascals Dog|accessdate=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burial options==
At some cemeteries, such as Aspin Hill Memorial Park in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Roadside America|url= http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/3626|title=Grave of a Petey, Little Rascals Dog|accessdate=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; human and animal remains may be interred alongside each other. In January 2010, West Lindsey District Council gave permission for a site in the village of [[Stainton by Langworth]] to inter animal remains alongside human remains as part of a "[[Natural burial|green burial]]" site, making it the first place in England where pets could be buried alongside their owners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/153754/Pet-lovers-can-be-buried-with-their-animals "Pet lovers can be buried with their animals"], [[Daily Express|Sunday Express]], accessed 25 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

''Reverse Television'' is a series of forty-four video portraits made by [[United States|American]] [[video artist]] [[Bill Viola]] in 1983, originally produced for [[broadcast television]] and later documented as a 15-minute video. These portraits depict people throughout [[Boston]] sitting in their living rooms, silently staring at the video camera as though it were a TV set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eai.org/title.htm?id=701|title=Reverse Television -- Portraits of Viewers (Compilation Tape)|website=Electronic Arts Intermix}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portraits were meant to take fit into the space normally occupied by television commercials and as such to "interrupt the continuity of the undifferentiated flow of the television picture, giving viewers the possibility of pondering their own position facing the screen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moisdon|first1=Stéphanie|title=Reverse Television - Portraits of Viewers|url=http://www.newmedia-art.org/cgi-bin/show-oeu.asp?ID=150000000034594&amp;lg=GBR|website=New Media Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

"Reverse Television" was first broadcast by [[WGBH-TV]] 
In an interview with [[Raymond Bellour]], Bill Viola describes the compromises he had to negotiate through in the making and initial distribution of "Reverse Television."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bellour|first1=Raymond|title=An Interview with Bill Viola|journal=T|date=Autumn 1985|volume=34|pages=91–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, Viola wanted the video portraits to be presented once every hour for a two-week period in one-minute segments with "no label, no title, or anything" attached to them. Viola claims that such a long duration as well as an absence of identifying information was crucial to the piece, since the work was meant to be a disruption of the normal viewing experience of television.

WGBH-TV, wishing to keep broadcasting costs low, wanted to show the portraits in fifteen-second segments. The station also refused to broadcast the videos without a title, requesting that Viola include a full description of the piece at the beginning of each clip. In a confrontation with the station director, Viola ultimately agreed to show the clips in thirty second segments with text at the end of each clip stating his name and the date.

== Video Summary ==

The 1984 documentation of the project begins with text describing the project:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GrIN9m83zw|title=reverse television.mov|website=Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;REVERSE TELEVISION is a project for broadcast television. A series of portrait recordings were made of people sitting in their homes, staring in silence at the camera.

Forty four portraits were made in the Boston area with subjects ranging in age from 16 to 93 years old. Ten continuous minutes were recorded with each person. An unbroken 1 minute segment of this material was to be broadcast.

The portraits would be shown each hour of the broadcast day as image inserts between programs. They would appear unannounced, with no titles before or after, and the series would run for several weeks.

WGBH TV Boston presented REVERSE TELEVISION from NOV. 14-28, 1983. They chose to air the portraits for 30 seconds each, showing them 5 times a day.

The following is a series of 15 second excerpts from all of the portraits. They are presented in the order they were recorded and represent a documentation of this project.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Tríptico de Santa Columba, Roger van der Weyden.jpg|thumb|600px|[[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''St Columba Altarpiece''. Oil on oak panel,  138 x 70 cm, 138 x 153 cm, 138 x 70. [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich]]

The '''''Saint Columba Altarpiece'''''  (sometimes '''''Adoration of the Kings''''') is a large c. 1455 oil-on-oak wood [[panel painting|panel]]  [[altarpiece]] by [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Rogier van der Weyden]], now in the [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich.&lt;ref name = "Campbell"&gt;Campbell (1980), 74&lt;/ref&gt; 

The three panels depict a narrative in which [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] is visited by the [[Annunciation|archangel Gabriel]]; she [[Nativity of Jesus|gives birth in a stable]], and she [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|presents the infant at the temple]]. The left wing shows the [[Annunciation]], the center depicts the [[Adoration of the Magi]] after [[Jesus|Christ]]'s birth, and the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Presentation in the Temple]] appears on the right wing.&lt;ref name = "Campbell"/&gt;

==Panels==

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden 008.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Annunication panel]]
The elegant Annunciation is filled with iconography, such as the faux carving of the [[fall of man]] on the side of the [[prie-dieu]] at which Mary kneels in her devotions. An old-fashioned cross hangs over her head in the center panel's Nativity scene; the donor is placed on the far left, and a sweeping landscape can be seen in the background.&lt;ref name = "Campbell"/&gt; The center panel's far right contains the exterior of the same building shown in the next scene from the inside, juxtaposing the stable with the temple and thereby causing an innovative yet jarring spatial and temporal juxtaposition. The stable is in [[Bethlehem]], the Temple in [[Jerusalem]], yet here they co-exist and function to bridge a gap from the [[Old Testament|Old]] to the [[New Testament]]. It the first Early Netherlandish painting where the building's exterior exists on one panel and its interior on the adjacent panel. Van der Weyden achieved an extremely innovative means of moving a narrative in a continuous fashion in this altarpiece. The Presentation occurs in the octagonal building's [[narthex]], surrounded by monumental arches,  another bold and innovative use of space and perspective.&lt;ref name = "Borchert87" /&gt;

The exterior panels on the reverse are covered with plain paint without evidence that they ever contained a [[donor portrait]]. The donor is positioned on the far left of the center panel.&lt;ref name = "Campbell"/&gt;

''Saint Columba altarpiece'' was the object of frequent copying in the 15th and 16th centuries,&lt;ref name = "Campbell"/&gt; and inspired some of [[Hans Memling]]'s works, among them the ''[[Triptych of Jan Floreins]]''.&lt;ref name = "Borchert87"&gt;Borchert, 87&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==Commission==

The altarpiece was included as part of the 1801 inventory of [[Cologne]]'s Saint Columba cathedral, where it resided in the von dem Wasservass family chapel, which was probably established in the 1460s by Goddert von dem Wasservass, burgomaster of Cologne. It is reasonable to assume such a prominent resident of the city commissioned the piece. According to [[Lorne Campbell (Art historian)|Lorne Campbell]], based on the number of known copies, the piece probably never left the private chapel until 1801.  [[Sulpiz Boisserée|Sulpiz]] and [[Melchior Boisserée|Melchior]] Boisseree bought it in 1808; their collection was acquired in 1827 for the [[Alte Pinakothek]] in Munich.&lt;ref name = "Campbell"/&gt;

'''Sexual selection''' is a mode of [[natural selection]] where members of one [[biological sex]] [[mate choice|choose mates]] of the other [[sex]] to [[mating|mate]] with (intersexual selection), and compete with members of the same sex for access to members of the opposite sex (intrasexual selection). These two forms of selection mean that some individuals have better [[reproductive success]] than others within a [[population]], either from being more attractive or preferring more attractive partners to produce [[offspring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biology: The Unity &amp; Diversity of Life |year=2013 |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=281 |author=Cecie Starr |edition=Ralph Taggart, Christine Evers, Lisa Starr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PHYS-20140129"&gt;{{cite news |last=Vogt |first=Yngve |title=Large testicles are linked to infidelity |url=http://phys.org/news/2014-01-large-testicles-linked-infidelity.html |date=January 29, 2014 |work=[[Phys.org]] |accessdate=January 31, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131114327/http://phys.org/news/2014-01-large-testicles-linked-infidelity.html |archivedate=January 31, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the breeding season, [[sexual selection in frogs]] occurs with the males first gathering at the water's edge and making their [[mating call]]s: croaking. The females then arrive and choose the males with the deepest croaks and best territories. Generalizing, males benefit from frequent mating and monopolizing access to a group of fertile females. Females have a limited number of offspring they can have and they maximize the return on the energy they invest in reproduction.

The concept was first articulated by [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] who described it as driving species adaptations and that many organisms had evolved features whose function was deleterious to their individual survival,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Darwin |first1=Charles |author2=A. R. Wallace |title=On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection |journal=Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London. Zoology |year=1858 |volume=3 |pages=46–50 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/pdf/1858_species_F350.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1858.tb02500.x |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022104103/http://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/pdf/1858_species_F350.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then developed by [[Ronald Fisher]] in the early 20th century. Sexual selection can, typically, lead males to extreme efforts to demonstrate their [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] to be chosen by females, producing [[sexual dimorphism]] in [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s, such as the ornate [[plumage]] of [[birds]] such as [[birds of paradise]] and  [[peafowl]], or the antlers of [[deer]], or the manes of [[lion]]s, caused by a [[positive feedback]] mechanism known as a [[Fisherian runaway]], where the passing-on of the desire for a trait in one sex is as important as having the trait in the other sex in producing the runaway effect. Although the [[sexy son hypothesis]] indicates that females would prefer male offspring, [[Fisher's principle]] explains why the [[sex ratio]] is 1:1 almost without exception. Sexual selection is also found in [[plant]]s and [[fungi]].

The maintenance of sexual reproduction in a highly competitive world is one of the major puzzles in biology given that [[asexual reproduction]] can reproduce much more quickly as 50% of offspring are not males, unable to produce offspring themselves.

== History ==

=== Darwin ===
Sexual selection was first proposed by Charles Darwin in ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' (1859) and developed in ''[[The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' (1871), as he felt that natural selection alone was unable to account for certain types of non-survival adaptations. He once wrote to a colleague that "The sight of a feather in a [[peahen|peacock]]'s tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!" His work divided sexual selection into male-male competition and female choice.

{{quote|... depends, not on a struggle for existence, but on a struggle between the males for possession of the females; the result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but few or no offspring.&lt;ref name=origin&gt;Darwin, Charles (1859). On the Origin of Species (1st edition). Chapter 4, page 88. "And this leads me to say a few words on what I call Sexual Selection. This depends ..." {{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=12 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105031643/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=12 |archivedate=2011-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|... when the males and females of any animal have the same general habits ... but differ in structure, colour, or ornament, such differences have been mainly caused by sexual selection.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1859). On the Origin of Species (1st edition). Chapter 4, page 89. {{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=12 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105031643/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=12 |archivedate=2011-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These views were to some extent opposed by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], mostly after Darwin's death. He accepted that sexual selection could occur, but argued that it was a relatively weak form of selection. He argued that male-male competitions were forms of natural selection, but that the "drab" peahen's coloration is itself adaptive as [[camouflage]]. In his opinion, ascribing mate choice to females was attributing the ability to judge standards of beauty to animals (such as [[beetle]]s) far too cognitively undeveloped to be capable of [[aesthetic]] feeling.&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wallace|first1=Alfred Russel|title=Note on Sexual Selection (S459: 1892)|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S459.htm|publisher=Smith, Charles|accessdate=13 January 2017|date=1892|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217215250/http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S459.htm|archivedate=17 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ronald Fisher ===

[[Ronald Fisher]], the [[England|English]] [[statistician]] and [[evolutionary biologist]] developed a number of ideas about sexual selection in his 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'' including the [[sexy son hypothesis]] and [[Fisher's principle]]. The [[Fisherian runaway]] describes how sexual selection accelerates the preference for a specific ornament, causing the preferred trait and female preference for it to increase together in a [[positive feedback]] runaway cycle. In a remark that was not widely understood&lt;ref name=Blind /&gt; for another 50 years he said:

{{quote|... plumage development in the male, and sexual preference for such developments in the female, must thus advance together, and so long as the process is unchecked by severe counterselection, will advance with ever-increasing speed. In the total absence of such checks, it is easy to see that the speed of development will be proportional to the development already attained, which will therefore increase with time [[exponential growth|exponentially]], or in [[geometric progression]]. —''Ronald Fisher, 1930''}}

[[File:South Africa-Tshwane-Rietvlei-Long-tailed Widowbird-01 cropped.jpg|thumb|Male [[long-tailed widowbird]]]]

This causes a dramatic increase in both the male's conspicuous feature and in female preference for it, resulting in marked [[sexual dimorphism]], until practical physical constraints halt further exaggeration. A [[positive feedback]] loop is created, producing extravagant physical structures in the non-limiting sex. A classic example of female choice and potential runaway selection is the [[long-tailed widowbird]]. While males have long tails that are selected for by female choice, female tastes in tail length are still more extreme with females being attracted to tails longer than those that naturally occur.&lt;ref&gt;Andersson, M, Sexual Selection, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher understood that female preference for long tails may be passed on genetically, in conjunction with genes for the long tail itself. Long-tailed widowbird offspring of both sexes inherit both sets of genes, with females [[Gene expression|expressing]] their genetic preference for long tails, and males showing off the coveted long tail itself.&lt;ref name=Blind /&gt;

[[Richard Dawkins]] presents a non-mathematical explanation of the runaway sexual selection process in his book ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]''.&lt;ref name=Blind&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1986). [https://books.google.com/books?id=sPpaZnZMDG0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sexual%20selection%22&amp;f=false The Blind Watchmaker]. Longman, London. Published in Penguin Books 1988, 1991, and 2006. Chapter 8, Explosions and Spirals.&lt;/ref&gt; Females that prefer long tailed males tend to have mothers that chose long-tailed fathers. As a result, they carry both sets of genes in their bodies. That is, genes for long tails and for preferring long tails become [[Linkage disequilibrium|linked]]. The taste for long tails and tail length itself may therefore become correlated, tending to increase together. The more tails lengthen, the more long tails are desired. Any slight initial imbalance between taste and tails may set off an explosion in tail lengths. Fisher wrote that:

{{quote|The exponential element, which is the kernel of the thing, arises from the rate of change in hen taste being proportional to the absolute average degree of taste. —''Ronald Fisher, 1932''&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Fisher]] in a letter to [[Charles Galton Darwin]], 22 November 1932, cited in Fisher, R. A., Bennett, J. H. 1999. ''The genetical theory of natural selection: A complete variorum edition'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Peacock Flying.jpg|thumb|The peacock tail in flight, the classic example of a [[Fisherian runaway]]]]

The female widow bird chooses to mate with the most attractive long-tailed male so that her progeny, if male, will themselves be attractive to females of the next generation - thereby fathering many offspring that carry the female's genes. Since the rate of change in preference is proportional to the average taste amongst females, and as females desire to secure the services of the most sexually attractive males, an additive effect is created that, if unchecked, can yield exponential increases in a given taste and in the corresponding desired sexual attribute.

{{quote|It is important to notice that the conditions of relative stability brought about by these or other means, will be far longer duration than the process in which the ornaments are evolved. In most existing species the runaway process must have been already checked, and we should expect that the more extraordinary developments of sexual plumage are not due like most characters to a long and even course of evolutionary progress, but to sudden spurts of change. —''Ronald Fisher, 1930''}}

Since Fisher's initial conceptual model of the 'runaway' process, Russell Lande&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Lande | first1=R. | year=1981 | title=Models of speciation by sexual selection on polygenic traits | url=| journal=PNAS | volume=78 | issue=6| pages=3721–3725 | doi=10.1073/pnas.78.6.3721 | pmid=16593036 | pmc=319643 }} {{cite web |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/78/6/3721 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612012041/http://www.pnas.org/content/78/6/3721 |archivedate=2013-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Peter O'Donald&lt;ref&gt;O'Donald, Peter (1980). Genetic Models of Sexual Selection. Cambridge University Press, New York, NY. 250 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; have provided detailed mathematical proofs that define the circumstances under which runaway sexual selection can take place.

==Theory==
===Reproductive success===
[[File:Irish Elk front.jpg|thumb|right|Extinct [[Irish elk]] (''Megaloceros giganteus''). These antlers span {{convert|2.7|m|ft}} and have a mass of {{convert|40|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.]]

The [[reproductive success]] of an organism is measured by the number of [[offspring]] left behind, and their quality or probable [[fitness (biology)|fitness]].

Sexual preference creates a tendency towards [[assortative mating]] or [[homogamy (biology)|homogamy]]. The general conditions of sexual discrimination appear to be (1) the acceptance of one mate precludes the effective acceptance of alternative mates, and (2) the rejection of an offer is followed by other offers, either certainly, or at such high chance that the risk of non-occurrence is smaller than the chance advantage to be gained by selecting a mate.

The conditions determining which sex becomes the more limited resource in intersexual have been hypothesized with the [[Bateman's principle]], which states that the sex which invests the most in producing offspring becomes a limiting resource over which the other sex competes, illustrated by the greater [[parental investment|nutritional investment]] of an egg in a [[zygote]], and the limited capacity of females to reproduce; for example, in humans, a woman can only give birth every ten months, whereas a male can become a father numerous times.

===Modern interpretation===
[[File:Susa group, mountain gorilla.jpg|thumb|left|Male [[mountain gorilla]], a tournament species]]
The sciences of [[evolutionary psychology]], [[human behavioural ecology]], and [[sociobiology]] study the influence of sexual selection in humans.

Darwin's ideas on sexual selection were met with scepticism by his contemporaries and not considered of great importance in the early 20th century, until in the 1930s biologists decided to include sexual selection as a mode of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Miller, Geoffey]], The Mating Mind, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Only in the 21st century have they become more important in [[biology]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://edge.org/conversation/sexual-selection-and-the-mind Sexual Selection and the Mind] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610185636/https://edge.org/conversation/sexual-selection-and-the-mind |date=2015-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory however is generally applicable and analogous to natural selection.&lt;ref name="Hosken2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hosken|first1=David J.|last2=House|first2=Clarissa M.|title=Sexual Selection|journal=Current Biology|date=January 2011|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.11.053|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982210015198|volume=21|pages=R62–R65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tribolium castaneum87-300.jpg|thumb|Flour beetle]]
[[File:Tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus).jpg|thumb|Tungara frog]]

Research in 2015 indicates that sexual selection, including [[mate choice]], "improves population health and protects against extinction, even in the face of genetic stress from high levels of inbreeding" and "ultimately dictates who gets to reproduce their genes into the next generation - so it's a widespread and very powerful evolutionary force." The study involved the [[flour beetle]] over a ten-year period where the only changes were in the intensity of sexual selection.&lt;ref name="popben"/&gt;

Another theory, the [[handicap principle]] of [[Amotz Zahavi]], [[Russell Lande]] and [[W. D. Hamilton]], holds that the fact that the male is able to survive until and through the age of reproduction with such a seemingly maladaptive trait is taken by the female to be a testament to his overall fitness. Such handicaps might prove he is either free of or resistant to [[disease]], or that he possesses more speed or a greater physical strength that is used to combat the troubles brought on by the exaggerated trait. Zahavi's work spurred a re-examination of the field, which has produced an ever-accelerating number of theories. In 1984, Hamilton and [[Marlene Zuk]] introduced the "Bright Male" hypothesis, suggesting that male elaborations might serve as a marker of health, by exaggerating the effects of disease and deficiency. In 1990, Michael Ryan and A.S. Rand, working with the [[tungara frog]], proposed the hypothesis of "Sensory Exploitation", where exaggerated male traits may provide a sensory stimulation that females find hard to resist. Subsequently, the theories of the "Gravity Hypothesis" by Jordi Moya-Larano et al. (2002), invoking a simple biomechanical model to account for the adaptive value for smaller male spiders of speed in clmbing vertical surfaces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2007.01335.x | volume=21 | title=Gravity still matters | year=2007 | journal=Functional Ecology | pages=1178–1181 | last1 = Moya-Laraño | first1 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Chase Away" by Brett Holland and William R. Rice have been added. In the late 1970s, Janzen and Mary Willson, noting that male flowers are often larger than female flowers, expanded the field of sexual selection into [[plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Mary F|date=June 1979|title=Sexual Selection In Plants|url=|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=113, No. 6|pages=777-790|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past few years, the field has exploded to include other areas of study, not all of which fit Darwin's definition of sexual selection. These include [[cuckold]]ry, nuptial gifts, [[sperm competition]], [[infanticide]] (especially [[infanticide in primates|in primates]]), physical [[beauty]], mating by subterfuge, species isolation mechanisms, male parental care, ambiparental care, mate location, polygamy, and homosexual rape in certain male animals.

Focusing on the effect of [[sexual conflict]], as hypothesized by William Rice, Locke Rowe et Göran Arnvist, [[Thierry Lodé]] argues that divergence of interest constitutes a key for evolutionary process. Sexual conflict leads to an [[antagonistic co-evolution]] in which one sex tends to control the other, resulting in a tug of war. Besides, ''the sexual propaganda theory'' only argued that mates were opportunistically lead, on the basis of various factors determining the choice such as phenotypic characteristics, apparent vigour of individuals, strength of mate signals, trophic resources, territoriality etc. and could explain the maintenance of genetic diversity within populations.&lt;ref&gt;Thierry Lodé (2006). "La guerre des sexes chez les animaux " Eds Odile Jacob, Paris. {{ISBN|2-7381-1901-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several workers have brought attention to the fact that elaborated characters that ought to be costly in one way or another for their bearers (e.g., the [[tail]]s of some species of [[Xiphophorus]] fish) do not always appear to have a cost in terms of energetics, performance or even survival. One possible explanation for the apparent lack of costs is that "compensatory traits" have evolved in concert with the sexually selected traits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://idea.ucr.edu/documents/flash/sexual_selection_costs/story.htm Sexual Selection Costs &amp; Compensations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606234023/http://idea.ucr.edu/documents/flash/sexual_selection_costs/story.htm |date=2014-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toolkit of natural selection===
[[File:Protarchaeopteryx 4713.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Protarchaeopteryx]]'' - skull based on ''[[Incisivosaurus]]'' and wings on ''[[Caudipteryx]]'']]

Sexual selection may explain how certain characteristics (such as feathers) had distinct survival value at an early stage in their evolution. [[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]] proposes that sexual selection might have contributed by creating evolutionary modules such as ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' feathers as sexual ornaments, at first. The earliest proto-birds such as China's ''[[Protarchaeopteryx]]'', discovered in the early 1990s, had well-developed feathers but no sign of the top/bottom asymmetry that gives wings lift. Some have suggested that the feathers served as insulation, helping females incubate their eggs. But perhaps the feathers served as the kinds of sexual ornaments still common in most bird species, and especially in birds such as peacocks and [[birds-of-paradise]] today. If proto-bird courtship displays combined displays of forelimb feathers with energetic jumps, then the transition from display to aerodynamic functions could have been relatively smooth.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;

Sexual selection sometimes generates features that may help cause a species' extinction, as has been suggested&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;Miller, Geoffrey (2000). The Mating Mind.

===Sexual dimorphism===
{{uncited section|date=November 2017}}
{{main article|Sexual dimorphism}}

Sex differences directly related to reproduction and serving no direct purpose in [[courtship]] are called [[primary sexual characteristics]]. Traits amenable to sexual selection, which give an organism an advantage over its rivals (such as in courtship) without being directly involved in [[reproduction]], are called [[secondary sex characteristic]]s.

[[Image:Descent of Man - Figure 16.jpg|thumb|The [[rhinoceros beetle]] is a classic case of [[sexual dimorphism]]. Plate from Darwin's ''[[Descent of Man]]'', male at top, female at bottom]]

In most sexual species the [[males]] and [[females]] have different [[Nash equilibrium|equilibrium]] strategies, due to a difference in relative investment in producing offspring. As formulated in Bateman's principle, females have a greater initial investment in producing offspring ([[pregnancy]] in mammals or the production of the egg in [[birds]] and [[reptiles]]), and this difference in initial investment creates differences in variance in expected reproductive success and bootstraps the sexual selection processes. Classic examples of reversed sex-role species include the [[pipefish]], and [[Wilson's phalarope]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sagebakken|first=Gry|last2=Kvarnemo|first2=Charlotta|last3=Ahnesjö|first3=Ingrid|date=2017-03-22|title=Nutritional state – a survival kit for brooding pipefish fathers|url=https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/121/2/312/3077155|journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|language=en|volume=121|issue=2|pages=312–318|doi=10.1093/biolinnean/blx002|issn=0024-4066}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, unlike a female, a male (except in [[monogamous]] species) has some uncertainty about whether or not he is the true parent of a child, and so is less interested in spending his energy helping to raise offspring that may or may not be related to him. As a result of these factors, males are typically more willing to mate than females, and so females are typically the ones doing the choosing (except in cases of [[forced copulation]]s, which can occur in certain species of [[primate]]s, [[duck]]s, and others). The effects of sexual selection are thus held to typically be more pronounced in males than in females.

Differences in secondary sexual characteristics between males and females of a species are referred to as [[sexual dimorphism]]s. These can be as subtle as a size difference (sexual size dimorphism, often abbreviated as SSD) or as extreme as horns and colour patterns. Sexual dimorphisms abound in nature. Examples include the possession of antlers by only male [[deer]], the brighter coloration of many male birds in comparison with females of the same species, or even more distinct differences in basic morphology, such as the drastically increased eye-span of the male [[stalk-eyed fly]]. The [[peacock]], with its elaborate and colourful tail feathers, which the [[peahen]] lacks, is often referred to as perhaps the most extraordinary example of a dimorphism. Male and female [[black-throated blue warbler]]s and [[Guianan cock-of-the-rock]]s also differ radically in their plumage. Early naturalists even believed the females to be a separate species. The largest sexual size dimorphism in [[vertebrates]] is the [[shell dwellers|shell dwelling]] [[cichlid]] [[fish]] ''[[Neolamprologus callipterus]]'' in which males are up to 30 times the size of females&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ota|first=Kazutaka|last2=Kohda|first2=Masanori|last3=Sato|first3=Tetsu|date=2010-05-01|title=Unusual allometry for sexual size dimorphism in a cichlid where males are extremely larger than females|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12038-010-0030-6|journal=Journal of Biosciences|language=en|volume=35|issue=2|pages=257–265|doi=10.1007/s12038-010-0030-6|issn=0250-5991}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many other fish such as [[guppy|guppies]] also exhibit sexual dimorphism. Extreme sexual size dimorphism, with females larger than males, is quite common in [[spiders]] and [[birds of prey]].

== The Role of Male-Male Competition in Sexual Selection ==
Male-male competition is when two males of the same species compete for the opportunity to mate with a female. [[Sexual dimorphism|Sexually dimorphic]] traits, size, sex ratio &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weir|first=Laura K.|date=2012-11-22|title=Male–male competition and alternative male mating tactics influence female behavior and fertility in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes)|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00265-012-1438-9|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=67|issue=2|pages=193–203|doi=10.1007/s00265-012-1438-9|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the social situation &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=PROCTER|first=D.

=== Conditions that Influence Competition ===

==== Sex Ratio ====
[[File:Oryzias_latipes(Hamamatsu,Shizuoka,Japan,2007)-1.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Oryzias_latipes(Hamamatsu,Shizuoka,Japan,2007)-1.jpg|thumb|Janapese medaka, ''Orzyas latipes''.]]
There are multiple types of male-male competition that may occur in a population at different times depending on the conditions. Competition variation occurs based on the frequency of various mating behaviours present in the population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One factor that can influence the type of competition observed is the population density of males.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When there is a high density of males present in the population, competition tends to be less aggressive and therefore sneak tactics and disruptions techniques are more often employed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These techniques often indicate a type of competition referred to as scramble competition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Japanese medaka, ''[[Japanese rice fish|Oryzias latipes]]'', sneaking behaviours refer to when a male interrupts a mating pair during copulation by grasping on to either the male or the female and releasing their own sperm in the hopes of being the one to fertilize the female.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Disruption is a technique which involves one male bumping the male that is copulating with the female away just before his sperm is released and the eggs are fertilized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, all techniques are not equally successful when in competition for reproductive success. Disruption results in a shorter copulation period and can therefore disrupt the fertilization of the eggs by the sperm, which frequently results in lower rates of fertilization and smaller clutch size.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Resource Value and Social Ranking ====
Another factor that can influence male-male competition is the value of the resource to competitors. Male-male competition can pose many risks to a male's fitness, such as high energy expenditure, physical injury, lower sperm quality and lost paternity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson-Flower|first=Martha J.|last2=Ridley|first2=Amanda R.|date=2015-09-24|title=Male-male competition is not costly to dominant males in a cooperatively breeding bird|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00265-015-2011-0|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=69|issue=12|pages=1997–2004|doi=10.1007/s00265-015-2011-0|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of competition must therefore be worth the value of the resource. A male is more likely to engage in competition for a resource that improves their reproductive success if the resource value is higher. While male-male competition can occur in the presence or absence of a female, competition occurs more frequently in the presence of a female.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The presence of a female directly increases the resource value of a territory or shelter and so the males are more likely to accept the risk of competition when a female is present.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The smaller males of a species are also more likely to engage in competition with larger males in the presence of a female.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to the higher level of risk for subordinate males, they tend to engage in competition less frequently than larger, more dominant males and therefore breed less frequently than dominant males.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is seen in many species, such as the Omei treefrog, ''[[Rhacophorus omeimontis]],'' where larger males obtained more mating opportunities and successfully mated with larger mates. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luo|first=Zhenhua|last2=Li|first2=Chenliang|last3=Wang|first3=Hui|last4=Shen|first4=Hang|last5=Zhao|first5=Mian|last6=Gu|first6=Qi|last7=Liao|first7=Chunlin|last8=Gu|first8=Zhirong|last9=Wu|first9=Hua|date=2016-02-23|title=Male-male competition drives sexual selection and group spawning in the Omei treefrog, Rhacophorus omeimontis|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00265-016-2078-2|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=70|issue=4|pages=593–605|doi=10.1007/s00265-016-2078-2|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Winner-Loser Effects ====
A third factor that can impact the success of a male in competition is [[Winner and loser effects|winner-loser effects]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeng|first=Yang|last2=Zhou|first2=Feng-Hao|last3=Zhu|first3=Dao-Hong|date=2018-06-26|title=Fight outcome briefly affects the reproductive fitness of male crickets|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27866-4|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27866-4|issn=2045-2322|pmc=6018733|pmid=29946077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burrowing crickets, ''velarifictorous aspersus,'' compete for burrows to attract females using their large mandibles for fighting. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Female burrowing crickets, are more likely to choose winner of a competition in the 2 hours after the fight.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The presence winning male suppresses mating behaviours of the losing males because the winning male tends to produce more frequent and enhanced mating calls in this period of time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Effect of Male-Male Competition on Female Fitness ===
Male-male competition can both positively and negatively affect female fitness. When there is a high density of males in a population and a large number of males attempting to mate with the female, she is more likely to resist mating attempts, resulting in lower fertilization rates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; High levels of male-male competition can also result in a reduction in female investment in mating.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many forms of competition can also cause significant distress for the female negatively impacting her ability to reproduce.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An increase in male-male competition can affect a females ability to select the best mates, and therefore decrease the likelihood of successful reproduction.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cayuela|first=Hugo|last2=Lengagne|first2=Thierry|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Bernard|last4=Joly|first4=Pierre|last5=Léna|first5=Jean-Paul|date=2016-06-24|title=Larval competition risk shapes male–male competition and mating behavior in an anuran|url=https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/27/6/1726/2453477|journal=Behavioral Ecology|language=en|volume=27|issue=6|pages=arw100|doi=10.1093/beheco/arw100|issn=1045-2249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some techniques can improve the fitness of the female. Group mating can positively affect the fitness of a female in Japanese medaka due to an increase in genetic variation, a higher likelihood of paternal care and a higher likelihood of successful fertilization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Examples ===
[[File:Narnia_femorata_P1080912a.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Narnia_femorata_P1080912a.jpg|thumb|A leaf-footed cactus bug, ''Narnia femorata.'']]
In Japanese medaka, females mate daily during mating season.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Males compete for the opportunity to mate with the female by displaying themselves aggressively and chasing each other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To obtain the selection of the females, they court the females prior to copulation by performing a courting behaviour referred to as "quick circles".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[Coreidae|leaf-footed cactus bugs]], ''Narnia femorata'', males compete for territories where females can lay their eggs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Males compete more intensely for cacti territories with fruit to attract females. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this species, the males possess sexually dimorphic traits, such as their larger size and hind legs, which are used to gain the most advantage over competitors when females are present, but are not used in the absence of females.

Anuran (such as [[Frog|frogs]]) select habitats (pools) free of conspecifics in order to minimize male-male competition for both themselves and their offspring.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Displays are used in attempt to keep competitors out of their territory and deter sneaking behaviours, while fighting is only used when necessary due to the high costs and risks associated with fighting.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Today, biologists say that certain evolutionary traits can be explained by [[intraspecific competition]] - competition between members of the same species - distinguishing between competition before or after [[sexual intercourse]].

[[File:Descent of Man fig48.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration from ''The Descent of Man'' showing the [[tufted coquette]] ''Lophornis ornatus'': female on left, ornamented male on right]]

Before [[sexual intercourse|copulation]], ''intrasexual selection'' - usually between males - may take the form of ''male-to-male combat''. Also, ''intersexual selection'', or ''[[mate choice]]'', occurs when females choose between male mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Campbell | first1=N. A. | author2=J. B. Reece | title=Biology | publisher=Benjamin Cummings | year=2005 | pages=1230 | isbn=0-8053-7146-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traits selected by male combat are called secondary sexual characteristics (including horns, antlers, etc.), which Darwin described as "weapons", while traits selected by mate (usually female) choice are called "ornaments". Due to their sometimes greatly exaggerated nature, secondary sexual characteristics can prove to be a hindrance to an animal, thereby lowering its chances of survival. For example, the large antlers of a moose are bulky and heavy and slow the creature's flight from predators; they also can become entangled in low-hanging tree branches and shrubs, and undoubtedly have led to the demise of many individuals. Bright colourations and showy ornamenations, such as those seen in many male birds, in addition to capturing the eyes of females, also attract the attention of predators. Some of these traits also represent energetically costly investments for the animals that bear them.  Because traits held to be due to sexual selection often conflict with the survival fitness of the individual, the question then arises as to why, in nature, in which [[survival of the fittest]] is considered the rule of thumb, such apparent liabilities are allowed to persist. However, one must also consider that intersexual selection can occur with an emphasis on resources that one sex possesses rather than morphological and physiological differences. For example, males of ''[[Euglossa imperialis]]'', a non-social bee species, form aggregations of territories considered to be leks, to defend fragrant-rich primary territories. The purpose of these aggregations is only facultative, since the more suitable fragrant-rich sites there are, the more habitable territories there are to inhabit, giving females of this species a large selection of males with whom to potentially mate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kimsey | first1 = Lynn Siri | year = 1980 | title = The behaviour of male orchid bees (Apidae, Hymenoptera, Insecta) and the question of leks | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 996–1004 | doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(80)80088-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After copulation, male–male competition distinct from conventional [[aggression]] may take the form of [[sperm competition]], as described by [[Geoff Parker|Parker]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Parker | first1=Geoffrey A. | authorlink=Geoff Parker | year=1970 | title=Sperm competition and its evolutionary consequences in the insects | url=| journal=[[Biological Reviews]] | volume=45 | pages=525–567 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.1970.tb01176.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1970. More recently, interest has arisen in [[Female sperm storage|''cryptic'' female choice]],&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard, WG. (1996) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=A0kcDzAlYy4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Female control: Sexual selection by cryptic female choice].'' Princeton, Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; a phenomenon of internally fertilised animals such as mammals and birds, where a female can get rid of a male's [[sperm]] without his knowledge.

[[File:Darwin sexual caricature.gif|thumb|upright|Victorian cartoonists quickly picked up on Darwin's ideas about display in sexual selection. Here he is fascinated by the apparent [[steatopygia]] in the latest fashion.]]

Finally, [[sexual conflict]] is said to occur between breeding partners,&lt;ref&gt;Locke Rowe, Göran Arnvist. (2013) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3g0fAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Sexual conflict]'', Princeton Univ Press. {{page needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes leading to an [[evolutionary arms race]] between males and females. Sexual selection can also occur as a product of [[pheromone]] release, such as with the stingless bee, ''[[Trigona corvina]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Trail Pheromone of a Stingless Bee, Trigona corvina (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Meliponini), Varies between Populations |url=http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/7/593 |journal=Chemical Senses |date=2010 |issn=0379-864X |pmid=20534775 |pages=593–601 |volume=35 |issue=7 |doi=10.1093/chemse/bjq057 |first=Stefan |last=Jarau |first2=Jochen |last2=Dambacher |first3=Robert |last3=Twele |first4=Ingrid |last4=Aguilar |first5=Wittko |last5=Francke |first6=Manfred |last6=Ayasse |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101123601/http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/7/593 |archivedate=2016-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female mating preferences are widely recognized as being responsible for the rapid and divergent evolution of male secondary sexual traits.&lt;ref&gt;Andersson M (1994). Sexual Selection. Princeton Univ Press, Princeton, NJ. {{page needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females of many animal species prefer to mate with males with external ornaments - exaggerated features of morphology such as elaborate sex organs. These preferences may arise when an arbitrary female preference for some aspect of male morphology — initially, perhaps, a result of [[genetic drift]] — creates, in due course, selection for males with the appropriate ornament. One interpretation of this is known as the [[sexy son hypothesis]]. Alternatively, genes that enable males to develop impressive ornaments or fighting ability may simply show off greater [[immune system|disease resistance]] or a more efficient [[metabolism]], features that also benefit females. This idea is known as the [[sexy son hypothesis#Good genes theory|good genes hypothesis]].

Bright colors that develop in animals during mating season function to attract partners. It has been suggested that there is a causal link between strength of display of ornaments involved in sexual selection and free radical biology.&lt;ref name="pmid10081154"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=von Schantz T, Bensch S, Grahn M, Hasselquist D, Wittzell H |title=Good genes, oxidative stress and condition-dependent sexual signals |journal=Proc.

Sci. |volume=266 |issue=1414 |pages=1–12 |date=January 1999 |pmid=10081154 |pmc=1689644 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0597 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To test this idea, experiments were performed on male [[Ctenophorus pictus|painted dragon lizards]].&lt;ref name="pmid22834746"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olsson M, Tobler M, Healey M, Perrin C, Wilson M |title=A significant component of ageing (DNA damage) is reflected in fading breeding colors: an experimental test using innate antioxidant mimetics in painted dragon lizards |journal=Evolution |volume=66 |issue=8 |pages=2475–83 |date=August 2012 |pmid=22834746 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01617.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Male lizards are brightly conspicuous in their breeding coloration, but their color declines with aging.  Experiments involving administration of [[antioxidant]]s to these males led to the conclusion that breeding coloration is a reflection of innate [[antioxidant|anti-oxidation]] capacity that protects against [[oxidative stress|oxidative damage]], including [[DNA oxidation|oxidative DNA damage]].&lt;ref name="pmid22834746" /&gt;   Thus color could act as a “health certificate” that allows females to visualize the underlying [[oxidative stress]] induced damage in potential mates.

Darwin conjectured that [[Heritability|heritable]] traits such as beards and hairlessness in different human populations are results of [[sexual selection in humans]]. [[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]] has hypothesized that many human behaviours not clearly tied to survival benefits, such as humour, music, visual art, verbal creativity, and some forms of [[altruism]], are courtship adaptations that have been favoured through sexual selection. In that view, many human artefacts could be considered subject to sexual selection as part of the [[extended phenotype]], for instance clothing that enhances sexually selected traits. Some argue that the [[evolution of human intelligence]] is a sexually selected trait, as it would not confer enough fitness in itself relative to its high maintenance costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchArticle.action?articleURI=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000062 PLoS ONE: Sexual Selection and the Evolution of Brain Size in Primates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013143/http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchArticle.action?articleURI=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000062 |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith married into an East Coast [[Nobility|blue-blood]] family in 1969.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt; In 1970, he was arrested for armed robbery. [http://agentofchaos.com/prisonbreak.html] Smith lived in Baltimore and other cities before coming to Cleveland in 1977&lt;ref name="Cullinan" /&gt; in pursuit of another man's wife.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt; She then divorced her husband and decided to marry someone other than Smith.&lt;ref&gt;Putre, Laura. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1996.html "Blurb,"] ''The Scene'' (Apr. 26, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==

Smith's [[Assemblage art|art assemblages]] started when one day, instead of painting a key on a canvas, he picked it up and pasted it onto the canvas.&lt;ref&gt;Heaton, Michael. [http://agentofchaos.com/heaton_030418.html "Nothing can save your life like a really good art attack,"] ''The Plain Dealer'' (Apr. 18, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's art uses iconic baubles with the effect of cheapening and attacking cultural themes.&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt; The work has been characterized as "difficult and uncompromising,"&lt;ref name="Sparks2"&gt;Sparks, Amy Bracken. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1988.html "A Place to Call Home,"] ''Cleveland Edition'' (Sept. 8, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; and "repellent and grotesque," with roots from the [[dadaist]] collages of [[Kurt Schwitters|Schwitters]] and [[Rauschenberg]].&lt;ref name="Litt" /&gt;

Materials used include rusted wire, shattered glass, obscene imagery, dead mice, the artificial leg of a dead drug dealer and sometimes other people's art.&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt; His work is washed in blue "corrosion," a mix of [[Liquitex|matte medium]], copper powder, and salt.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Frank. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1994.html "Alchemy In Reverse,"] ''The Cleveland Free Times'' (Apr. 20, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Another reviewer says Smith's use of oxidized copper makes his works appear to be fetched from the bottom of the sea.&lt;ref name="Utter2" /&gt;

Smith uses cultural themes as found objects.&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt; "I deal in symbolic juxtapositions of the odd and unwanted," Smith says. "My materials consist of cultural castoffs, sociological implications and the refuse known as suburban thought. My goals are simple; erase your labels; learn to look about ... Learn to see dead frog and rust and thus re-see yourself."&lt;ref name="Cullinan" /&gt; He says, "My art is a collaboration with the pieces."&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

After the death of his brother Cat (Vincent Smith), Smith started exhibiting his brother's remains at his shows, leaving some of the ashes behind after each exhibit.&lt;ref name="Bly" /&gt;

==Notoriety==

Smith first gained notoriety with a piece — ''American Ego'' — in the People's Art Show at CSU. His piece was a four-by-three grid of [[Instant film|Polaroid]] snapshots, nude photos of himself in compromising positions with the American flag.&lt;ref&gt;Neff, James. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1984.html "Must Be Profound,"] ''The Plain Dealer'' (Dec. 3, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; This piece won the "most outrageous" award at the show.&lt;ref name="Cullinan" /&gt;

Next, three pieces of his art were censored from a show at [[Tri-C]] West. Smith agreed to the removal as long as a "censored" notice was put on the wall in place of the missing art. The opening night poetry reading was reassigned to a remote conference room. During the reading Smith discovered that Tri-C neglected to post the notes. He wrote "CENSORED" on the wall with a ball point pen. Poet [[Daniel Thompson (poet)|Daniel Thompson]] decided to read in the original gallery, and mouthed the words to his poem silently as a Tri-C co-director sanded the words off the wall.&lt;ref&gt;Cullinan, Helen. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1986.html "Censorship Charges Mar Tri-C West Show"] ''Cleveland Plain Dealer'' (May 1, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

Smith worked longest as a computer programmer, which helped support ''[[ArtCrimes]]'' and his art. He frequently contracted with [[BP]]. Previous occupations include sailor, milk man, life insurance salesman, avant garde theater manager, newspaper film and music critic, woman's shoe salesmen, prison cook, carnival laborer, and church janitor. He's also worked at [[Bethlehem Steel]].&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tranberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cullinan" /&gt;

Smith's "resume" was published in an article from 2000:

==Cleveland Warehouse District==

Smith and his friend and frequent collaborator S. Judson Wilcox were two early "urban pioneers": artists who settled the [[The Warehouse District|Warehouse District]] in Cleveland in 1981.&lt;ref name="Morton"&gt;Morton, Elizabeth. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1987_b.html "Art Behind Bars,"] ''Dialogue Magazine'' (July 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Artists, musicians and renegades moved there to revel in Cleveland's industrial beauty.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt; The warehouse district was a haven.&lt;ref name="Cullinan" /&gt;

Smith and Wilcox had an "Art Behind Bars" installation in the district with mannequins, Mickey Mouse, and neon tube calliope.&lt;ref name="Morton" /&gt;

Smith's brother "Cat" moved into the warehouse with him.&lt;ref name="Litt" /&gt; Cat Smith's collages were dead ringers for Schwitters'.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

Smith and Cat's spot in the warehouse became a gathering spot for other artists in the building, and scene, including S. Judson Wilcox, Melissa Jay Craig (AKA "Field Marshal May Midwest"), Jeff Chiplis, Laszlo Gyorki, Ken Nevadomi, Randy Rigutto, Jay Clements, and Beth Wolfe.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt; Guests were offered keepsakes of miniature toy soldiers, babies in plastic bubbles, or poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Amy Bracken.  [http://agentofchaos.com/review1998.html "Howling at the Edge of a Renaissance: SPACES and Alternative Art in Cleveland, 1978-1998,"] Performance Art Festival catalogue (Sept. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

SPACES Gallery was located on the first floor, making the warehouse the [[de facto]] epicenter of creative activity.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

Cat was a troubled man who eventually committed suicide.&lt;ref name="Litt" /&gt; After he died, Smith heard a beeping in his studio. He couldn't figure out where the beeping came from, and thought it was the soul of his dead brother. He then found a worn-out smoke detector at the bottom of a huge pile in his studio.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

In another installation with Wilcox, Smith used a bag of his dead brother's ashes. He claimed to have a pact with Cat. The first to die would be included in an exhibition of the other's work.&lt;ref&gt;Cullinan, Helen. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1988_a.html "Ashes to Ashes, Poet to Artist,"] ''The Cleveland Plain Dealer''
(July 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the exhibitions at SPACES gallery, Smith put Cat's ashes on a pedestal. The bag was punctured by a friend and ashes spilled onto the pedestal and the floor.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

==''ArtCrimes''==
{{main|ArtCrimes}}
Before making visual art, Smith crafted unique journals into which he'd juxtapose images and poetry and journal entries.&lt;ref name="Sparks"&gt;Sparks, Amy Bracken. [http://agentofchaos.com/surreal_thing.html "Surreal Thing: Eccentric Artist and Collector Steve Smith Bares All,"] ''Free Times'' (Mar. 15-21, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Smith wrote clever, punning poetry and read it all over town. (His poetry is described as "a stream-of-consciousness assault on reason and order" and "a cross between Dada and [[Jack Kerouac]].")&lt;ref name="Tranberg" /&gt; Smith used his art and poetry to make political statements, and he also participated in a couple legendary "regional art terrorist" raids in the [[Flats District (Cleveland)|Flats]].&lt;ref name="Sparks"/&gt;

Starting in 1986, Smith published the Cleveland [[Underground art|cult underground publication]] ''[[ArtCrimes]]'', a zine full of images and poems which also shared his disrespect for authority. ''ArtCrimes'' took on the spirit of Smith's journals, like a sketchbook that's been passed around to dozens of different artists.&lt;ref name="Tranberg"&gt;Tranberg, Dan. [http://agentofchaos.com/plaindealer_acarticle_0802.html "Art Matters: Underground publication carries on as a quiet force,"] ''The Plain Dealer'' (August 2, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bly"&gt;Bly, Lyz. [http://agentofchaos.com/dwarf/review050511.html "Capturing the Smiths: Mother Dwarf's collages evoke an often painful family history,"] ''Cleveland Free Times'' (May 11, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The zine was influenced by the [[beat (music)|beats]],&lt;ref name="Utter"&gt;Utter, Douglas Max. [http://agentofchaos.com/utter0608.html "Criminals At Large: Steven B. Smith's Farewell ''ArtCrimes'' Is His Best Ever,"] ''Cleveland Free Times'' (August 9, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and was consistent with the style of publications from the days of [[Kerouac]], [[Gregory Corso|Corso]], and [[Allen Ginsberg|Ginsberg]].

Contributors included everyone from [[Charles Bukowski|Bukowski]] and [[Jack Micheline|Micheline]] to people's pets. Ohio poets and artists included the likes of [[Daniel Thompson (poet)|Daniel Thompson]], Maj Ragain, Amy Bracken Sparks, Ben Gulyas, Chris Franke, [[Harvey Pekar]], [[Gary Dumm]], [[Masumi Hayashi (photographer)|Masumi Hayashi]] and Ken Nevadomi.&lt;ref name="Budimir"&gt;Budimir, Milenko. [http://agentofchaos.com/budimir_0606.html "Crimes-free Cleveland:  The city’s agent of chaos takes on a new mission,"] ''Northern Ohio Live'' (June 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer postulated that ''ArtCrimes'' was the most significant publication of the Cleveland underground art scene in recent history.&lt;ref name="Utter" /&gt;

==Tremont==

The affordability of Cleveland neighborhoods periodically caused mass migrations of artists. In the 1980s, Smith was one of the urban pioneers to move into the Warehouse District.&lt;ref name="Morton" /&gt; In '85, he was one of many artists who moved from the warehouses to [[Tremont, Cleveland|Tremont]], in the typical pattern where artists move into undesirable but inexpensive neighborhoods, fixing up old buildings in which to live and work.&lt;ref name="Sparks2" /&gt;

Shortly after Smith's move to Tremont, Cat committed suicide. Pappy Smith died shortly after, and Mother Dwarf (Florence E. Smith) left Las Vegas to come to live with Smith.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sparks3"&gt;Sparks, Amy Bracken. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1993_b.html "A Most Common Name, A Most Unusual Family,"] ''The Cleveland Free Times'' (Aug. 11, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Mother Dwarf began her art career producing collages for ''[[ArtCrimes]]''.&lt;ref name="Bly" /&gt; Smith and his mother's life together became a mother-son artistic collaboration.&lt;ref name="Utter2" /&gt;

Smith nearly died in 1991 from alcohol, and has been sober since then.&lt;ref name="Sparks3" /&gt; One notable drunken episode was after an art auction. He'd bid loudly on every piece offered. He took a walk home with Mother Dwarf. He passed a fence of barking dogs, and started to howl "in communion." He leaned up over the dogs and they bit his scalp. The next day, Smith asked Mother Dwarf why he was covered in blood. "You mean..." she said, "You don't remember the dogs?"&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

==Recent==

In an interview in 2000, Smith claimed his voice was raspy "because I don't talk to anyone anymore." He'd become a recluse whose doormat said "Go Away."&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt; He said, "I had to learn silence. People only remember the old days when I shocked people with what I said or made or did. But there's a lot of beauty in the things I've done."&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

In 2005 Smith's life hit a series of highs and lows. His mother died, he fell in love, he retired, and then discovered he had throat cancer. He published the final issue of ''[[ArtCrimes]]'' in 2006.&lt;ref name="Tranberg2"&gt;Tranberg, Dan. [http://agentofchaos.com/tranberg060505.html "Art Matters With Dan Tranberg: Emigrating artist Steven Smith holds 'liquidation sale' exhibit,"] ''The Plain Dealer'' (May 5, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith is a [[documentarian]]. His journals are not the only documentation of his life. He continues with his 2500-page website agentofchaos.com.&lt;ref name="Utter2" /&gt;

Smith married poet Lady K in 2006. They began their relationship shortly after the death of Mother Dwarf in 2005.&lt;ref name="Utter2" /&gt; In 2006 Smith and his wife sold their home, gave away all of their possessions, and moved to Europe.&lt;ref name="Tranberg2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4949">'''Sue Williams''' (born 1956 in [[Cornwall]]) is a British [[visual artist]], trained, living and working in [[Wales]].&lt;ref name="BBCWales" /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Sue Williams was born in 1956 in [[Redruth]], [[Cornwall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://artesmundi.org/artists/sue-williams "Sue Williams"], Artes Mundi, Retrieved 23 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams studied art in [[Cardiff]] in the 1970s, later getting her [[Master of Arts]] from [[Cardiff College of Art]] (UWIC).&lt;ref name="BBCWales" /&gt;

==Work==
Williams made the news in 2009 when she was awarded £20,000 from [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] funds (via the [[Arts Council of Wales]]) to finance a study of cultural attitudes towards women’s bottoms.&lt;ref name="Mirror bottoms" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox bottoms" /&gt; She explained to the ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'' that the money would cover living costs while she built up a new collection of three dimensional work, which would partly consist of plaster casts of all parts of women's bodies. "My present work stems from a desire to visually explore and understand issues related to the feminine ideal - the desire to change body shape, the pressure to create perfection and to compromise a personal identity" she said.&lt;ref name="WM buttock moulding" /&gt; Williams had been inspired by a visit to [[Zimbabwe]], where her work had been taken down from two galleries because it portrayed women's backsides.&lt;ref name="WM buttock moulding" /&gt;

In 2009 Williams visited China to study their gender politics and the dynamics of communication between men and women. She was invited back again in 2013 to take part in a touring exhibition called ''Open Books''. The exhibition subsequently toured to Australia.&lt;ref name="CCQ Open Mind" /&gt;

Her work is represented in the collection of the [[University of South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oriel y Bont: Museum Collection |work=|publisher=University of South Wales |url=http://gallery.southwales.ac.uk/oriel-y-bont-collection/ |format= |accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is currently a lecturer in fine art at [[University of Wales Trinity Saint David]] in [[Swansea]].&lt;ref name="CCQ Open Mind" /&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2000 Williams was the recipient of the [[Welsh National Eisteddfod]] Gold Medal for Fine Art&lt;ref name="Gold Medal" /&gt; and the Rootstein Hopkins Foundation Award for painting.&lt;ref name="BBCWales" /&gt; In 2005 she was one of eight shortlisted artists (the only British representative) for the second biannual [[Artes Mundi|Artes Mundi Prize]].&lt;ref name="AM shortlist" /&gt;

[[File:Petroglyphmanandwoman.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Petroglyph]] of male and female dancers, in [[Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park]].]]
'''Sydney rock engravings''', or '''Sydney rock art''', are a form of [[Australian Aboriginal]] [[rock art]] in the [[Sydney sandstone|sandstone]] around [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], that consist of carefully drawn images of people, animals, or symbols.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, J. 1999. Bedrock notions and isochrestic choice: evidence for localised stylistic patterning in the engravings of the Sydney region. Archaeology in Oceania 34(3): 145-160.&lt;/ref&gt; Many thousands of such engravings are known to exist in the Sydney region, although the locations of most are not publicised to prevent damage by vandalism, and to retain their sanctity, as they are still regarded as sacred sites by [[Indigenous Australians]]. There are two art environments in Sydney Basin, rock shelters and engraving sites.&lt;ref&gt;Basedow, H. 1914. Aboriginal rock carvings of great antiquity in S.A. J. R. Anthropol. Inst., 44, 195–211. &lt;/ref&gt; 

There are 1,500 pieces of Aboriginal art in Sydney, more than half of which contain rock art, and around 1,500 caves or shelters which contain cultural deposit. They are comparable with the [[petroglyphs]] of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and the [[rock art]] found elsewhere in Australia, but have their own distinctive style which is quite unlike rock art found anywhere else in Australia.

==Origins==
[[File:(1)rock carvings Bondi-4.JPG|thumb|220px|Whale carvings in [[Bondi, New South Wales|Bondi]].]]
The engravings were made by the [[Aboriginal Australians]] who have lived in the [[Sydney]] region from about 30,000 years ago until the present day. [[Radiocarbon dating]] suggests human activity first started to occur in the Sydney area from around 30,735 years ago. However, numerous Aboriginal stone tools were found in Western Sydney's gravel sediments that were dated from 45,000 to 50,000 years BP, which would indicate that there was human settlement in Sydney earlier than thought.&lt;ref name=Attenbrow-2010&gt;{{Cite book | last1= Attenbrow | first1= Val | year= 2010 | title= Sydney's Aboriginal Past: Investigating the Archaeological and Historical Records | location= Sydney | publisher= UNSW Press | isbn= 978-1-74223-116-7 | pages= 152–153 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TDxldj_SLcYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22Val%20Attenbrow%22&amp;pg=PA152#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | accessdate= 11 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The engravings cannot be dated straightforwardly with contemporary archaeological methods, necessitating the use of indirect dating. The Sydney engravings are of a style known as "simple [[Figurative art|figurative]]", which formulaic archaeology dates to around [[3,000 BC]] and [[4th millennium BC|4,000 BC]], which is contemporaneous to the [[neolithic]] period in [[Eurasia]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Flood, 'Rock Art of the Dreamtime',  {{ISBN|0-207-18908-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other engravings show [[Europe]]an [[sailing ships]], and so those cannot be more than about 200 years old. It is likely that some of the freshest engravings represent the later part of that time range, whilst the most worn represent the earliest part. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that the engravings were sometimes "re-grooved" during ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;David, B., J-M. Geneste, F. Petchey, J-J. Delannoy, B. Barker and M. Eccleston. 2013b. ‘How old are Australia’s pictographs? A Review of Rock Art Dating’. Journal of Archaeological Science 40 (1): 3–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some engravings appear to show [[thylacine]]s and other mammals which have been extinct in the Sydney region for many thousands of years, and thus can be presumably that old. In support of this, it is true that rock art elsewhere (e.g. [[Kakadu National Park]]) does show extinct animals, and so must be tens of thousands of years old. However, at the moment there is no hard evidence to support these claims for Sydney rock art.&lt;ref&gt;Bednarik, R. G. 1992. ‘A New Method to Date Petroglyphs’. Archaeometry 34 (2): 279–91. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Method of creation==
Examination of the grooves shows that they were made in several stages as follows:

* Presumably, a sketched outline was scratched on to the surface of the rock.
* Then a series of holes was drilled along the line, using a pointed stone or shell, which is possible because the [[Sydney Basin]] [[sandstone]] is relatively soft.
* Finally, the holes were joined by rubbing a sharp stone along the line.

This results in a U-shaped groove which is typically about 2 centimetres deep and 2 centimetres wide. It is easily distinguished from natural grooves in the sandstone, which are usually V-shaped, modern grooves made with steel tools, which are usually narrower and deeper, or those made by bulldozers, which usually have a square section.&lt;ref&gt; McDonald, J. 2008a. Dreamtime Superhighway: Sydney Basin Rock Art and Prehistoric Information Exchange. Terra Australis 27. ANU EPress, Canberra&lt;/ref&gt;

The grooves were often maintained by "re-grooving" during ceremonies, which complicates attempts at dating them.&lt;ref&gt;Lilley, I. 2006. ‘Archaeology in Oceania: Themes and Issues.’ Archaeology of Oceania: Australia and the Pacific Islands, 1– 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
While their purpose is not known definitively, some educated guesses may be made by analogy with the culture of other indigenous groups who survived into modern times, as follows. Some sites may have been "increase sites", where a ceremony would be held to increase the availability of a food source such as kangaroos or fish. It is thought that most of the sites depicting animals are of this type.

Another group of sites may have been where initiation ceremonies were held, to celebrate and facilitate the transition of a young boy into manhood. In other parts of [[Australia]], we know that an initiation ceremony often involves a ceremonial path from childhood into manhood, and so the lines of steps, or mundoes, may indicate initiation sites. Other sites show "Culture Heroes" or "Ancestral Beings" such as [[Baiame]], who has a striped head-dress and often a striped body, and [[Daramulan]] who has a large club foot and may have been part-emu.

Some sites also show evidence of [[Australian Aboriginal Astronomy|Aboriginal Astronomy]], as the rock's patterns resemble the [[Milky Way]] and this may have been purposed as an astrological guide. It should also be recognised that increase sites, initiation sites, culture-hero sites, and astronomical sites are not necessarily distinct, and one site may fall into any or all of these categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.EmuDreaming.com|title=Aboriginal Astronomy|website=www.emudreaming.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
[[File:Terrey Hills public.jpg|thumb|220px|Engravings at Terrey Hills in northern Sydney. The two kangaroos suggest this was used for an increase ceremony, whilst the well-endowed man may be [[Baiame]].]]
The aboriginal rock engraving sites usually contain images of sacred [[spiritual being]]s, mythical ancestral hero figures, various endemic animals, fish and many footprints. Surrounding the rock engravings, there are art sites, [[burial]] sites, [[cave]]s, marriage areas, men’s areas, women’s areas, birthing areas, [[midden]] sites, stone arrangement sites and tool manufacturing locations.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, J.1994. ‘Dreamtime Superhighway: Sydney Basin Rock Art and Prehistoric Information Exchange.’ PhD, Canberra: Australian National University.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Les McLeod, a local indigenous guide in [[Hawkesbury, New South Wales|Hawkesbury]] stated, “A lot of Aboriginal people believe they were created from animals – there are engravings here of wallabies, fish and emus”. “Sydney sandstone is easy to engrave but easy to fade. The [[Guringai]] people would have visited a couple of times a year to re-engrave it.” In some small cave on the water’s edge, there are ochre [[hand stencil]]s from a group of Guringai men (and from a smaller handprint, a minor). The stencils would have been a way of letting other members of the clan know that this cave or ledge is a safe place to dwell in. Rock paintings of a fish just above the water line signaled to others that fish could be found at this area. The majority (97%) of the etched motifs are
outline only. The only systematically infilled engravings are [[culture hero]]es which are usually decorated with a number of pecked lines of dots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboriginalheritage.org/sites/identification/ Identifying Aboriginal Sites]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
Shelters with art are characterised by stencil art or [[charcoal]]. Stencil is created by mixing [[ochre]] in the mouth and then into a wet paste, where it is sprayed over the object to be stencilled onto the wall of the shelter. Other forms of artwork include ochre paintings, charcoal drawings and etchings. Rock painting illustration usually feature humans, kangaroos, emus, echidnas, grid patterns, animal tracks, boomerangs, axes, hand stencils, among others. Black is the frequent colour used in Sydney, accounting for 46.2% of the pigment art. Followed by white (34.6%), red (16.6%) and yellow (2.8%). There are also a number of grinding grooves located throughout the general Sydney area.  Burial sites are present throughout the Sydney region, and many have been found over the past years in middens and within shelters. &lt;ref&gt;McDonald, J. 1998. Shelter art in the Sydney Basin - a space-time continuum: exploring different influences on stylistic change. In C. Chippindale &amp; P. Taçon (eds) Rock Art: New Directions in Archaeology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock engravings in Sydney would usually feature fish, animals, humans, wooden artefacts, and mythological beings. Stone quarries are sites where Aboriginals accumulate types of [[stone]] for the manufacturing of tools, ceremonial and sacred items. The majority of the fine stone flakes and tools recovered in the local area would have been traded from other areas such as the north coast, [[Hunter Valley]], and the [[Nepean River]]. [[Water well|Dug wells]] in the Sydney region were used by the local tribe to sharpen tools and also as a source of fresh [[drinking water]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, F. D., 1956. Rock engravings of the Sydney-Hawkesbury District. Part 1: Flat Rocks Ridge: a Daruk ceremonial ground. Records of the Australian Museum 24(5): 37–58, plates 3–6. [23 November 1956].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motif frequency===

A total of 7,804 motifs were studied from the 717 engravings sites, with a salient focus on tracks, followed by a predilection for [[marine animal]]s and land animals, [[anthropomorphic]]
models and cultural items.&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, L. 1977. ‘Classification and Terminology in Australian Rock Art’. In (ed) P. J. Ucko Form in Indigenous Rock Art, Prehistory and Material Culture. Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Canberra, 13:387–402.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are approximately 2,000 rock engraving sites, which are usually located on highly elevated, smooth and flat surfaces. More than half of the engraving sites (55.9%) are located on ridgelines. Hillside locations are the next most frequent (41.2%), while [[valley]] bottoms are comparatively rare (2.8%). The average distance to drinking water from any engraving site in the region is 650m and the maximum distance is approximately 3km. The minimum distance is 2m (rock wells or creeks).&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, F.

'''Theatre Cedar Rapids''' ('''TCR''') is a [[community theatre]] in [[Cedar Rapids]], [[Iowa]]. The theatre performs several stage shows every year, and offers acting classes. Each year TCR is seen by more than 50,000 patrons, who view the work of over 35,000 volunteer hours.

==History==

===Early years===
In 1925 as part of the [[Little Theatre Movement]], [[Grant Wood]] and other local community members staged small performances in Wood's apartment at [[Grant Wood Cultural District|5 Turner Alley]]. Wood created sets for the theatre, as well as writing, directing, and acting in plays.&lt;ref name="GrantWoodALife"&gt;{{cite book | title=Grant Wood: A Life | author=Evans, Tripp | location=books.google.co.uk/books?id=IohRHlkHJHwC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq= | pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uiowa"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/grantwood/id/563/show/505/rec/7 | title=Grant Wood Scrapbook | accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood also used the space as his artist studio, and painted the famous [[American Gothic]] at this location.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.crma.org/Content/Grant-Wood/Grant-Wood-Studio.aspx Grant Wood Studio]", Cedar Rapids Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt; Additional scenery was also built and painted by [[Marvin Cone]]. The onset of [[World War II]] put the theatre group on hiatus.

===Post-war years===
In 1948, after the war ended,  the group reorganized calling themselves "The Footlighters".&lt;ref name="HowItWorks"&gt;{{cite book | title=The community theatre and how it works | publisher=Harper | author=Young, John Wray}}&lt;/ref&gt; They generally performed at the local [[YMCA]] and at [[Coe College]]. In 1955 the group moved to the Old Strand Theatre, a building that had been a movie palace since 1912, and had also been known as The Olympic. The group renamed themselves to 'The Cedar Rapids Community Theatre (CRCT)'&lt;ref name="HistoryOfCommunityTheatreInCedarRapids"&gt;{{cite book | title=The History of Community Theatre in Cedar Rapids, Iowa | author=Beard, Bill Lawrence | year=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===
In June 1928, the '[[RKO]] Iowa Theatre' opened and served as a cinema, as well as offering [[vaudeville]] stage shows. In 1940, [[Katharine Hepburn]] played at the theatre in the stage version of ''[[The Philadelphia Story (play)|The Philadelphia Story]]''. In April, 1983 the theater was shut down. Four months after the closing of the theater, the space was donated to the CRCT by Audrey Linge. When they occupied the Iowa Theatre building, the group renamed itself Theatre Cedar Rapids.&lt;ref name="Cedar Rapids  : Downtown and Beyond"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hentry, George |author2=Hunter, Mark | title= Cedar Rapids : Downtown and Beyond | year=2005 | pages=82 | isbn=9780738539652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2008 flood====
During the [[Iowa flood of 2008]], the theatre was significantly damaged, and was shut down until February 2010. While the building was being repaired the group performed at local malls and churches. Stars [[Michael Emerson]]&lt;ref name="Emerson"&gt;{{cite video | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmDthANZ9YY | title=Michael Emerson speaks in support of Theatre Cedar Rapids}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ron Livingston]]&lt;ref name="Livingston"&gt;{{cite video | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMbvQObxB2o | title=Ron Livingston speaks about Theatre Cedar Rapids}}&lt;/ref&gt; both natives of the Cedar Rapids area, recorded videos to help fundraising efforts for repairs.

After the theatre restoration, one of the early shows was [[Rent (musical)|''Rent'']]. [[Anthony Rapp]], who originated the role of Mark Cohen in the Broadway production of the show, was invited to and attended one of the performances. After the show he participated in an extensive question and answer session about the history of the show. Of the TCR performance and theatre he said "Thank you guys, for a performance with so much heart, grace, humor and spirit", and "To be able to restore this theater shows the community’s commitment to the arts — and this theater is amazing"&lt;ref&gt;"[http://thegazette.com/2010/07/25/broadway-star-graces-theatre-cedar-rapids-for-rent/ Broadway star graces Theatre Cedar Rapids for ‘Rent’]", ''The Gazette'', 25 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66lOc5ohc7A Anthony Rapp RENT post-show discussion part 1/4]", YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;

====Laramie Project protest====
In 2010, TCRs production of ''[[The Laramie Project]]'', a play about the murder of gay student [[Matthew Shepard]], was the target of a protest by [[Westboro Baptist Church]]. The church website said "We will picket your filthy, goofy 'theatrical production' of the Laramie Project". Theatre supporters and others opposed to the church's position arranged a counter-protest, but in the end the church protest did not materialize. The counter-protesters converted their protest into a solidarity rally when it was apparent that the church was not going to appear.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://accesslineiowa.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=190:westboro-baptist-church-to-picket-laramie-project-at-theatre-cedar-rapids-1115-counter-protest-planned&amp;catid=3:lgbt-newsflash&amp;Itemid=53 Westboro Baptist Church to Picket Laramie Project at Theatre Cedar Rapids 11/15.

====80th season====
Theatre Cedar Rapids will be one of the first community theatres in the world to perform ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]''. Movie star [[Hugh Jackman]], who performed the role of [[Jean Valjean]] in the movie version, recorded a greeting to the theatre wishing "[[Chookas]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://hooplanow.com/2013/09/06/big-news-tcr/&lt;/ref&gt; TCR is also one of the first theatres in the world to perform the stage version of [[Disney]]'s [[Mary Poppins (musical)|Mary Poppins]]

[[File:Moscow Changing of the Guard.webm|thumb|right|400px|Changing of the Guard at the '''Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Moscow)''' in Moscow]]
The '''Tomb of the Unknown Soldier''' (Могила Неизвестного Солдата in [[Russian language|Russian]], {{IPA-ru|mɐˈɡʲilə nʲɪɪˈzvʲɛsnəvə sɐlˈdatə|}}) is a [[war memorial]], dedicated to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] soldiers killed during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]]. It is located at the [[Kremlin Wall]] in the [[Alexander Garden]] in [[Moscow]].

The remains of the unknown soldiers killed in the [[Battle of Moscow]] in 1941 were initially buried in a [[mass grave]] of the [[Shtyki Memorial]] at the 40th km of the Leningrad highway at the city of [[Zelenograd]]. This was the location of the closest approach of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] armies to Moscow during the war. To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the battle, in December 1966 these remains were relocated to the Kremlin Wall. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was designed by architects D. I. Burdin, V. A. Klimov, Yu. R. Rabayev and sculptor [[Nikolai Tomsky]], and was unveiled to the public on May 8, 1967. The dark red [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] monument is decorated with a [[bronze]] sculpture of a [[Bay laurel|laurel]] branch and a soldier's helmet laid upon a banner.

In front of the monument, there is a five-pointed star in a square field of [[labradorite]], which emanates the [[Eternal flame|Eternal Flame]] from its center. The flame illuminates a bronze inscription "''Имя твоё неизвестно, подвиг твой бессмертен''" (translit.: Imya tvoyo neizvestno, podvig tvoy bessmerten, "Your name is unknown, your deed is immortal").  The torch for the memorial's Eternal Flame was transported from [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], where it had been lit from the Eternal Flame at the [[Field of Mars (Saint Petersburg)|Field of Mars]].

To the left of the tomb is a granite wall with an inlay stating: "1941 - To Those Who Have Fallen For The Motherland - 1945". 
To the right of the tomb, lining the walkway are dark red [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] blocks with incapsulated soils from [[Hero City|hero cities]], [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], [[Kiev]], [[Stalingrad]], [[Odessa]], [[Sevastopol]], [[Minsk]], [[Kerch]], [[Novorossiysk]], [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] and [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]], [[Murmansk]] and [[Smolensk]]. The plate for “Stalingrad” read “Volgograd” until September 2004.  
Further to the right of these monuments is an [[obelisk]] in red [[granite]], listing the names of 40 “[[City of Military Glory|Cities of Military Glory]]” divided into groups of four. This monument was dedicated on May 8, 2010.

In 1997, a [[Honour guard|Guard of Honour]] of the [[Kremlin Regiment]] (which had guarded the [[Lenin Mausoleum]]) was restored at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier by the federal law of December 8, 1997, "On Immortalizing the Soviet People’s Victory in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945". A Changing of the Guard Ceremony takes place every hour.

[[File:Windows in the West.jpg|thumb|''Windows in the West'' by Avril Paton. Watercolour on paper, 1993. Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow.]]
'''''Windows in the West''''' is a 1993 watercolour painting by the Scottish artist Avril Paton. The painting was bought by the city of Glasgow for the [[Glasgow Gallery of Modern Art]], and is currently on display at the [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]].
 
==Description==
[[File:Windows in the West building, 35 Saltoun Street, Glasgow G12.jpg|thumb|right|35 Saltoun Street in September 2016.]]
The painting depicts the external profile of a 4-storey yellow [[sandstone]] [[tenement]] building during winter; the residents of the building can be seen doing various activities, with a mother and child, a man at a computer, and someone pulling aside curtains to look out at the snow outside.&lt;ref name=ETMay07&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/12783249.The_people_who_live_inside_city_apos_s_most_famous_painting/|title=The people who live inside city's most famous painting|author=Shelia Hamilton|date=9 May 2007|work=Glasgow Evening Times|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paton depicted herself standing outside the door of the building in the painting, and later found out that a cat she thought she had seen was actually made from china.&lt;ref name=ETMay07/&gt; The painting is painted in gouache, egg tempera and watercolour, measures 5 x 4ft and took six months to complete.&lt;ref name=ScotMay05&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/time-to-move-out-of-the-tenement-1-738556|title=Time to move out of the tenement|date=5 March 2005|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardJul04&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/jul/17/art|title= Snow business: Ian Jack on the enduring appeal of a painting deemed out of style|author=[[Ian Jack]]|date=17 July 2004|work=The Guardian|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper wrote of ''Windows in the West'' in 2005 that "There was something cosily familiar about the painting's cheery, glowing character, the snow-covered roof and the warm yellow stone, the embracing perspective. ...It carries a nostalgic, storybook charm; Katie Morag in Glasgow's West End".&lt;ref name=ScotMay05/&gt;

The building depicted in the painting is located at 35 Saltoun Street on the corner of Roxburgh Street in the [[Dowanhill]] district in Glasgow's [[Glasgow#West End|West End]], and is a [[Listed building#Scotland|Category B listed]] building. It was built in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/LB32583|title=20-26 (Even Nos) Roxburgh Street and 33-35 (Odd Nos) Saltoun Street LB32583|publisher=Historic Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Paton was living as a caretaker of a top floor flat opposite the building on Saltoun Street on 11 January 1993, when at 5.30&amp;nbsp;pm, during a heavy [[blizzard]], she saw 35 Saltoun Street "transformed" with a "lilac pink sky, lighted windows, clarity of whiteness, lots of people at home" according to Melanie Reid who interviewed Paton in 2005 for ''The Scottish Herald''.&lt;ref name=HeraldFeb05&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12398702.Window_on_another_world_Avril_Paton_is_about_to_close_the_door_on_her_life_as_The_Tenement_Painter__as_Melanie_Reid_explains/|title=Window on another world Avril Paton is about to close the door on her life as The Tenement Painter, as Melanie Reid explains|author=Melanie Reid|date=26 February 2005|work=The Scottish Herald|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preliminary drawings for the paintings were completed in February and ''Windows in the West'' was finally finished in June. Paton had not set out to create such a large work, originally intending to paint the architectural detail of the building's drum windows. Paton said in 2005 that she had "realised I had made a mistake with the size of the paper. At that time I was terribly poor...Buying art materials was difficult. I was upset that the paper was the wrong size", but was galvanised to finish the work by her son who said "Oh it would be great if you could pull it off!"&lt;ref name=HeraldFeb05/&gt;

It was originally planned to show the painting at Anne Mendelow's Gatehouse Gallery at Glasgow's Rouken Glen Park but Mendelow proposed that it was loaned to [[Glasgow Royal Concert Hall]] in the intervening period as it was taking up so much space in Paton's flat.&lt;ref name=HeraldOct94&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12666952.Window_on_life_in_the_city/|title=Window on life in the city|author=Deedee Cuddihy|date=18 October 1994|work=The Scottish Herald|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of ''Windows in the West'' at the Royal Concert Hall bought it to the attention of the director of Glasgow's museums, Julian Spalding, who purchased it for the city in 1996. Spalding subsequently said that "What it caught was that moment when it was nearly dark, but people haven't drawn the curtains yet, and you can walk along the street and look into windows, and there's the light inside, and the light outside. People are going about their business in a private way; at the same time they have not yet hidden their private world. There is the balance between the inner life and the outer life that is just beautifully caught".&lt;ref name=ScotMay05/&gt; Paton's 1988 painting ''The Barras'' had previously been bought by Glasgow Art Galleries and Museums and as her major sale it had established her as an artist.

Paton subsequently described the residents as having been "thrilled to be in the painting...That building was a community in itself. They were colourful characters, who were always having parties".&lt;ref name=ETMay07/&gt; Paton has described her surprise at the popularity of the work, saying in a 2005 interview that "I find that quite amazing, because I don't understand it at all. I wasn't aware that it was going to be anything other than just another painting for an exhibition. I lived there for four to six years before I started the painting. I used to look at that building continually and enjoy it. I enjoyed seeing what people were doing. I would stand in the window, drink a cup of tea. Once it was painted, I never looked at it again".&lt;ref name=ScotMay05/&gt;

In a May 2007 article for the ''[[Glasgow Evening Times]]'', Shelia Hamilton interviewed residents of the building depicted in ''Windows in the West'' who recalled their memories of Paton and the effect of the painting on their lives. Hamilton wrote that "Maybe the day will come when there's a plaque on the wall...and we get guided tours. But for now, all most of us can do is wander along the street just round the corner from the Byres Road and have a quick peek as we pass by and wonder what it's like to live inside a painting" and described the building as "probably the most famous tenement in the world". Hamilton attributed the paintings appeal to the fact that "...they are real people living real lives and the reason why this picture has such a hold on the public's imagination. Outside, it may be icy in the painting but inside the rooms they are cocooned forever in safety and warmth".&lt;ref name=ETMay07/&gt; Paton said in a 2005 interview that "I haven't distanced myself from it; the picture has distanced itself from me. It's like a child. It goes off and leads its own life".&lt;ref name=HeraldFeb05/&gt;

Paton has sold almost 30,000 prints and 100,000 cards of reproductions of the painting; in 2005 it was the top selling print in Glasgow's Gallery of Modern Art shop.&lt;ref name=ScotMay05/&gt;

''Windows in the West'' featured in a 2005 poll by the ''[[Glasgow Herald]]'' newspaper to find Scotland's favourite painting, and as a result of which subsequently inspired a poem by the [[Poet Laureate of Scotland]], [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]].&lt;ref name="Morgan2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edwin Morgan|title=Beyond the Sun: Scotland's Favourite Paintings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MBItAgAACAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Luath Press|isbn=978-1-905222-72-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zellige''' ({{IPA-ar|zˈliʑ|lang}}; {{lang-ar|الزليج}}; also '''zelige''' or '''zellij''') is mosaic [[tile]]work made from individually chiseled geometric tiles set into a [[plaster]] base.&lt;ref&gt;[[L'Opinion]] (May 6, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; This form of [[Islamic art]] is one of the main characteristics of [[Moroccan architecture]]. It consists of [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometrically patterned]] [[mosaic]]s, used to [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]] walls, ceilings, fountains, floors, pools and tables.

==History==
{{further|Islamic geometric patterns}}

The [[Moors|Moorish]] art of zellige flourished during the [[Hispano-Moresque]] period ([[Azulejo]]) of the [[Maghreb]] and the area known as [[Al-Andalus]] (modern day [[Spain]]) between 711-1492. The technique was highly developed during the [[Nasrid dynasty]] and [[Merinid dynasty]] who gave it more importance around the 14th century and introduced blue, green and yellow colours. Red was added in the 17th century. The old enamels with the natural colours were used until the beginning of the 20th century and the colours had probably not evolved much since the period of Merinids. The cities of [[Fes]] and [[Meknes]] in [[Morocco]], remain the centers of this art.

Patrons of the art used zellige historically to decorate their homes as a statement of luxury and the sophistication of the inhabitants. Zellige is typically a series of patterns utilizing colourful [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]]. This framework of expression arose from the need of [[Islamic art]]ists to create spatial decorations that [[Aniconism in Islam|avoided depictions of living things]], consistent with the teachings of [[Sharia|Islamic law]].

== Clays for Zellige ==
[[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] and Meknes in Morocco are still the production centers for zellige tiles due to the [[Miocene]] grey clay of [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]]. The clay from this region is primarily composed of [[Kaolinite]]. For [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] and Meknes, the clay composition is 2-56% clay minerals, calcite 3-29%. Meriam El Ouahabi states that:

{{quote|From the other sites (Meknes, Fes, Salé and Safi), the clay mineral composition shows besides kaolinite the presence of [[illite]], [[chlorite]], [[smectite]] and traces of mixed layer illite/chlorite (Fig. 3). Meknes clays belong to illitic clays, characterized by illite (54 – 61%), kaolinite (11 – 43%), smectite (8 – 12%) and chlorite (6 – 19%) (Fig. 3). Fes clays have a homogeneous composition (Fig. 3) with illite (40 – 48%). and kaolinite (18 – 28%) as the most abundant clay minerals. Chlorite (12 – 15%) and smectite (9 – 12%) are generally present as small quantities. Mixed layer illite/chlorite is present in trace amounts in all the examined Fes clay materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=El Ouahabi |first=Meriam |year=2014 |title=Mineralogical and geotechnical characterization of clays from northern Morocco for their potential use in the ceramic industry |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261479494_Preliminary_mineralogical_and_geotechnical_characterization_of_clays_from_Morocco_application_to_ceramic_industry |journal=Clay Minerals |volume=49 |pages=35–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Forms and trends==

As the colour palette of the zellige tiles increased over the centuries, it became possible to multiply the compositions ''ad infinitum''. The most current form of the zellige is a square. Other forms are  possible: the [[octagon]] combined with a [[cabochon]], a [[star]], a [[cross]], etc. It is then [[Molding (process)|moulded]] with a thickness of approximately 2 centimetres. There are simple squares of 10 by 10 centimeters or with the corners cut to be combined with a coloured cabochon. To pave an area, [[bejmat]], a [[Pavement (architecture)|paving stone]] of 15 by 5 centimetres approximately and 2 centimetres thick, can also be used.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"An encyclopedia could not contain the full array of complex, often individually varied patterns and the individually shaped, hand-cut [[tesserae]], or [[furmah]], found in zillij work. Star-based patterns are identified by their number of points—'itnashari for 12, 'ishrini for 20, arba' wa 'ishrini for 24 and so on, but they are not necessarily named with exactitude. The so-called [[khamsini]], for 50 points, and mi'ini, for 100, actually consist of 48 and 96 points respectively, because geometry requires that the number of points of any star in this sequence be divisible by six. (There are also sequences based on five and on eight.) Within a single star pattern, variations abound—by the mix of colors, the size of the furmah, and the complexity and size of interspacing elements such as strapping, braids, or "lanterns." And then there are all the non-star patterns— [[honeycomb]]s, webs, steps and shoulders, and [[checkerboard]]s. The [[Alhambra]]'s interlocking zillij patterns were reportedly a source of inspiration for the tessellations of modern Dutch artist [[M.C. Escher]]."&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Louis. 2001. [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200103/zillij.in.fez.htm "Zillij in Fez."] Saudi Aramco World. May–June 2001. Volume 52 (3). Pages 18–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Themes often employ [[Kufic]] script, as it fits well with the geometry of the mosaic tiles, and patterns often culminate centrally in the [[Rub El Hizb]]. The [[tessellation]]s in the mosaics are currently of interest in academic research in the [[mathematics and art|mathematics of art]].

==Zellige craftsmanship==

Zellige making is considered an [[art]] in itself. The art is transmitted from generation to generation by ''maâlems'' (master craftsmen). A long training starts at childhood to implant the required skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beton-decoratif.com/infos.htm beton-decoratif.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Assiduous attention to detail is needed when creating zellige. The small shapes (cut according to a precise [[radius gauge]]), painted and enamel covered pieces are then assembled in a geometrical structure as in a [[puzzle]] to form the completed mosaic. The process has not varied for a millennium, though conception and design has started using new technologies such as [[data processing]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;gallery&gt;
