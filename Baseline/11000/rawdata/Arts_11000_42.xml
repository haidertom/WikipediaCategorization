'''Alexey Petrovich Bogolyubov''' ({{lang-ru|Алексей Петрович Боголюбов}}; 16 March 1824 – 3 February 1896) was a [[Russians|Russian]] [[landscape art|landscape]] painter.

==Biography==
Bogolyubov was born in the Pomeranie village of [[Novgorod]] [[Gubernia]]. His father was retired colonel Pyotr Gavriilovich Bogolyubov. Bogolyubov's maternal grandfather was the well-known philosopher and social critic [[Alexander Radishchev]].&lt;ref name=peoples&gt;[http://www.peoples.ru/art/painter/bogolybov/ ''Alexey Bogolyubov''] {{ru icon}} article&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1841, Alexey graduated from military school, serving in the [[Russian Navy]] and travelling with the fleet to many countries. In 1849, he started to attend classes of the [[Saint Petersburg]] Academy of Arts, where he studied under [[Maxim Vorobiev]]. The young painter was greatly influenced by [[Ivan Ayvazovsky]]. In 1853, he finished the Academy with a major Gold medal. He retired as a navy officer and was appointed an artist to the Navy headquarters.

From 1854 to 1860, he travelled around Europe and worked prolifically. In [[Rome]], he was acquainted with [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov|Alexander Ivanov]], who convinced Bogolyubov to focus more on drawing. In [[Düsseldorf]], Bogolyubov took classes from the painter [[Andreas Achenbach]]. In [[Paris]], he admired the artists of the [[Barbizon School]]. French painters [[Camille Corot]] and [[Charles-François Daubigny]] were good friends and collaborators with Bogolyubov. He also painted the [[fresco]]es in the [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Paris|Alexander Nevsky Cathedral]].

Bogolyubov returned to Russia in 1860. He exhibited his works in the Academy and received the title of professor. For some time, he taught in the Academy. In the 1860s, he traveled along the [[Volga River|Volga]]. His paintings lost all traces of [[Romanticism]], replacing that element with staunch realism of the natural. In 1871 he was elected to the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]].

[[Image:Bogolyubov sailingships.jpg|thumb|right|Sailing ships, 1860]]
From 1870, he became close to the [[Peredvizhniki|Wanderers]] art movement, participated in all their exhibitions. He became a member of their board. Much older than most of the other members of the movement, he had reservations on their social ideas. In 1873, Bogolyubov left the Academy in solidarity with his fellow Itinerants. He even tried to create an alternative Russian Academy of Arts in Rome.&lt;ref name=peoples/&gt;

After 1873, Bogolyubov lived primarily in Paris, because of his heart condition. His house was like a Russian colony: frequent visitors included [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Ilya Yefimovich Repin]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Mark Antokolski]], [[Vasili Vasilyevich Vereshchagin]].&lt;ref name=peoples/&gt;
[[Image:OpeningOfRadischevMuseum.jpg|frame|left|Opening of [[Radischev Art Museum]] in Saratov]]

In 1885, Bogolyubov opened an art museum in [[Saratov]], the [[Radischev Art Museum]], named after his grandfather. It was opened to the general public seven years earlier than the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] in [[Moscow]] and fifteen years earlier than the [[Russian Museum]] in Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref name=RadischevMus&gt;[http://www.radmuseumart.ru/pages/index.asp?id_pages=23&amp;id_header=6 Bogolyubov page on the site of Saratov Radischev Museum] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The naming of the museum after the "first Russian revolutionary", [[Alexander Radishchev]], was a direct challenge to the authorities: Bogolyubov had to endure a legal battle to get permission.

Bogolyubov died on 3 February 1896 in [[Paris]]. After his death, Bogolyubov left all his money and capital (around 200 thousand [[Russian ruble]]s (approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]6 million) to the museum and its painting school.&lt;ref name=peoples/&gt; The school was opened after Bogolyubov's death and named Bogolyubov's Painting School (Боголюбовское Рисовальное Училище).&lt;ref name=peoples/&gt; Among painters who attended Bogolyubov's School were such important modernist painters as [[Victor Borisov-Musatov]] and [[Pavel Kuznetsov]].

[[File:Antimachiavell.jpg|thumb|228px|1740]]

'''''Anti-Machiavel''''' is an 18th-century essay by [[Frederick the Great]], King of [[Prussia]] and patron of [[Voltaire]], consisting of a chapter-by-chapter rebuttal of ''[[The Prince]]'', the 16th-century book by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], and [[Machiavellianism]] in general. It was first published in September 1740, a few months after Frederick became king.

==Composition and publication==

The work, written in French, was produced at a turning point in Frederick's life, after his turbulent and rebellious youth, and immediately before his assumption of the throne of Prussia.  Frederick had, of course, read Machiavelli long before; it is not exactly clear what drew his attention to this subject in the late 1730s, although his affiliation with Voltaire and his impending change in rank most certainly contributed to the project. It is known from letters to Voltaire that Frederick began to ruminate on the project early in 1738; his draft of the brief work was completed by the end of 1739.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick II to Voltaire, 6 November (1739), ''Correspondence'', VII&lt;/ref&gt;

Voltaire took over in Summer 1740. Living in [[Huis Honselaarsdijk]], the Prussian residence near The Hague, and working with a dubious printer named Jan van Duren, Voltaire revised the text extensively on purpose and in order to get the manuscript back.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Voltaire-Holland-1736-1745-Republique-Lettres/dp/9042923539 Strien, K. van (2011) ''Voltaire in Holland, 1736-1745'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Machiavel by
Frederick II, p. x [https://books.google.com/books?id=UHAGAAAAQAAJ&amp;hl=nl&amp;pg=PR10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a combined edition, with Voltaire's emendations as footnotes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Frederick sent [[Francesco Algarotti]] to London to take care of the publication of Anti-Machiavel in English. In the meantime, Frederick had become king, and his authorship — which was a very open secret — made the book an instant success and bestseller. Not surprisingly, Frederick had other matters to occupy his attention, and he did not return to the work in an appreciable way.

==Argument==
Frederick's argument is essentially moral in nature: he asserts that Machiavelli offered a partial and biased view of statecraft. His own views appear to reflect a largely [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideal of rational and benevolent statesmanship: the king, Frederick contends, is charged with maintaining the health and prosperity of his subjects. On the one hand, then, Machiavelli erred by assigning too great a value on princely machinations that, Frederick claims, ended in disaster, as the king's evil actions are taken up by his subjects. On the other hand, and in support of the first idea, Frederick points out the numerous cases in which Machiavelli had ignored or slighted the bad ends of the numerous malefactors he describes and praises.

'''''Anticipation''''' is an award-winning Irish advertisement launched by [[Guinness plc]] in 1994 to promote [[Guinness]]-brand [[draught beer|draught]] [[stout]]. The advert, which appeared in [[Newspaper advertising|print]], [[billboard (advertising)|posters]], and [[television advertisement|cinema and television]] spots, was conceived by Liam O'Flaherty at Irish [[advertising agency]] Arks, directed by Richie Smyth, edited by Hugh Chaloner&lt;ref name=Hugh&gt;[http://hughchaloner.com/guinness/ Guinness “Anticipation”], hughchaloner.com, 18 May 1994. Retrieved 2 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and starred the relatively unknown Irish actor [[Joe McKinney]], as 'Dancing Man', the barman was played by Londoner Gordon Winter. It was the final part of the "Guinness Time" [[advertising campaign]], which had been running in Ireland since the late 1980s.

The piece was hugely successful, increasing Guinness' sales, market share and brand awareness figures. However, controversy arose following claims of plagiarism raised by British director [[Mehdi Norowzian]], who launched an unsuccessful lawsuit in 1998 seeking remuneration for the use of techniques and style from his 1992 short film ''Joy''.

==Sequence==
The low-budget ad featured only two characters: a patron of an unidentified [[public house|pub]] and the barman serving him. The patron (McKinney) orders a pint of Guinness stout and, while waiting for the pint to be poured, carries out a series of quirky dancing movements with the settling pint in the foreground, to the amusement of the barman. The piece ends with the patron taking his first sip of the freshly poured pint overlaid by the Guinness [[advertising slogan]] "No time like Guinness Time". The advert is set to ''Guaglione'' by [[Pérez Prado]], and makes heavy use of [[jump cutting]] from a static camera to allow the dancer to make a series of movements that could not be achieved in reality.&lt;ref name="HMCS"&gt;[http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j144/norowzian.htm HM Courts Service – High Court Judgment of ''Norowzian v. Arks Ltd. et al.'']{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 17 July 1998. Retrieved 27 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The distinctive jump cut editing techniques of ''Anticipation'' won the commercial a degree of critical acclaim and several awards from within the advertising industry, including the 1995 Institute of Creative Advertising &amp; Design craft award for [[Film editing|editing]] as well as a Gold Medal for editing and a Golden Shark award at the [[Kinsale]] International Advertising Festival.&lt;ref name=Hugh/&gt;

The success of the campaign led Guinness to re-broadcast it in the United Kingdom in 1995, as a transition between the campaign "The Man With the Guinness"/"Pure Genius", which had just concluded with ''[[Chain (Guinness)|Chain]]'', and its new "Black and White" campaign, still in development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=21223 Guinness comes to those who've waited] PR Newswire for Europe, 1997. Retrieved 27 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Though ''Chain'' was to be the last in the ''Pure Genius'' campaign, ''Anticipation'' was tagged with the ''Pure Genius'' slogan in the UK instead of ''There's No Time Like Guinness Time''.

As a result of its featuring in the spot, Pérez Prado's ''Guaglione'' reached the Number 1 spot in the Irish [[music chart]]s,&lt;ref name="Mirror"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19971116/ai_n14470613 Guinness TV ad dancer Joe is pulling pints for a living (Findarticles.com)], ''[[The Sunday Mirror]]'', 16 November 1997. Retrieved 27 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and Number 2 in the British [[Top 40]].&lt;ref name="UKCharts"&gt;[http://ukcharts.20m.com/inst1.html Instrumentals at Number One], ''UK Chart Facts &amp; Feats'', 24 April 2003. Retrieved 1 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
In 1992, British director [[Mehdi Norowzian]] submitted a [[show reel]] containing a number of short examples of his work to several prospective employers, including the Irish advertising agency Arks Ltd., in the hopes of being taken on to direct one or more of their commercials. Included on the reel was a short piece entitled ''Joy'', which was shot using a static camera on a London rooftop and comprised a jump cut sequence of a man performing an extended dance of exuberation against a plain canvas background.

Arks Ltd. were contracted by Guinness to produce an advertisement to run in Ireland. Among the ideas proposed was one based on a scene from the [[The Snapper (film)|cinematic version]] of [[Roddy Doyle]]'s novel, ''[[The Snapper (novel)|The Snapper]]'', where a man rushes into a pub to celebrate the birth of his grandson with a pint of Guinness. The artistic director at Arks, thinking on possible ways to build on the concept, recalled Norowzian's submitted reel and came up with a script and storyboard based on ''Joy'' to present to Guinness. The idea was accepted, and Arks approached Norowzian to direct the commercial. Norowzian refused, as he was unwilling to simply "commercialise" an old idea, and wanted to create something new. Rebuffed, the agency then took on Richie Smyth as director, urging him to create something "with an atmosphere broadly similar to that portrayed in ''Joy''". Feeling that the original storyboard was too close to ''Joy'', a new one was prepared. The result was ''Anticipation''.&lt;ref name=HMCS/&gt;

Following the broadcast of the television spot in 1994, Norowzian lodged a complaint and ultimately a [[lawsuit]] against Arks Ltd. and Guinness, claiming that ''Anticipation'' breached his copyrights and accusing the agency of [[passing off]]. The plaintiff's claim for [[copyright infringement]] were based on a passage in the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] defining a [[dramatic work]] as including "recordings of a work of dance or mime", and that ''Anticipation'' was, or included, a copy of a substantial part of ''Joy''. The case reached the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in 1997, where the claim of passing off was dropped. On 17 July 1998, Justice Rattee rendered his judgment that the jump cutting techniques used in ''Joy'' produced something qualitatively different from a recording of a dance or mime routine and that, as such, ''Joy'' was not in itself a dramatic work. It was therefore defined as an [[entrepreneurial work]], a status which confers protection over only the physical recording of a work rather than the work itself. He also ruled that ''Anticipation'' did not reproduce either the whole or part of ''Joy''.&lt;ref name=HMCS/&gt;

The decision was appealed, but while the [[Court of Appeal]] unanimously held that the content of a film (including the use of film and editing techniques) could enjoy copyright protection as a dramatic work, the presiding Justices ruled that ''Anticipation'' did not significantly copy any portion of ''Joy'' and dismissed the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.briffa.com/library/copyright/cinematographers.htm Some Joy at last for Cinematographers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805011948/http://www.briffa.com/library/copyright/cinematographers.htm |date=5 August 2007 }}, Briffa.com. Retrieved 27 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Norowzian was ordered to pay £200,000 in legal costs.&lt;ref name="Ind"&gt;Beard, Matthew; "[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/artists-claim-honda-copied-their-film-in-tv-cog-advert-539158.html Artists claim Honda copied their film in TV cog advert]", ''[[The Independent]]'', 28 May 2003. Retrieved 3 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the case, the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] called for reform of copyright law in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The lifestyle became too hectic and he gave up alcohol in 1997.&lt;ref name="trib2009"/&gt; He found it difficult to secure other roles due to [[Typecasting (acting)|typecasting]] as "the Guinness man", spending time in the US where the ad had not been broadcast.&lt;ref name="Mirror"/&gt;&lt;ref name="trib2009"/&gt;

[[Image:Eskipation.jpg|right|thumb|A comparison of two frames from ''Anticipation'' with their respective versions in ''Eskimo''.]]
As one of the most recognisable Guinness advertisements of the 1990s, ''Anticipation'' has been mimicked or parodied in a number of more recent Guinness campaigns, including the Irish ''Waiting'' spot in 2004 promoting [[beverage can|cans]] of Guinness draught beer,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dublinpubs.ie/story.asp?id=19  Guinness wards off draught with strong home sales pitch (Dublinpubs.ie)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011211833/http://www.dublinpubs.ie/story.asp?id=19 |date=11 October 2007 }}, ''[[Irish Independent]]'', 25 November 2004.

The film was produced as part of a production deal with [[Universal Studios]] after the financial success of ''[[Darkman]]''. Filming took place in California in 1991. The makeup and creature effects for the film were handled by two different companies: [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner]] and his company [[Alterian, Inc.]] were responsible for the Ash &amp; Sheila makeup effects, while Kurtzman, Nicotero &amp; Berger EFX Group was credited for the remaining special makeup effects characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofthedead.ws/website/army_of_darkness_credits.html |title=Book Of The Dead - The Definitive Evil Dead Website |publisher=Bookofthedead.ws |date= |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Army of Darkness'' premiered at the [[Sitges Film Festival]] on October 9, 1992, and was released in the United States on February 19, 1993. It grossed $21.5 million total over a $11 million budget, and received positive reviews, though notably less than the first two films. Since its video release it has acquired a [[Cult film|cult following]], along with the other two films in the trilogy. The film was dedicated to [[Irvin Shapiro]], who died during the film's production in 1989 on New Year's Day.

== Plot ==
After being transported to the Middle Ages, [[Ash Williams]] is captured by [[King Arthur|Lord Arthur]]'s men, who suspect him an agent for Duke Henry, with whom Arthur is at war. He is enslaved along with the captured Henry, his gun and chainsaw confiscated, and is taken to a castle. Ash is thrown in a pit where he kills a Deadite and regains his weapons from Arthur's Wise Man. After demanding Henry and his men be set free, as he knew it was a [[Witch-hunt|witch hunt]], and killing a Deadite publicly, Ash is celebrated as a hero. He grows attracted to Sheila, the sister of one of Arthur's fallen knights.

According to the Wise Man, the only way Ash can return to his time is through the magical ''[[Necronomicon#In popular culture|Necronomicon Ex-Mortis]].'' Ash then starts his search for the ''Necronomicon''. As he enters a haunted forest, an unseen force pursues Ash into a windmill, crashing into a mirror. Small reflections of Ash in the mirror shards come to life, with one becoming a life-sized clone, after which Ash kills and buries it. 

When he arrives at the ''Necronomicon''{{'}}s location, he finds three books instead of one and determines which is the actual book. Attempting to say the phrase that will allow him to remove the book safely{{snd}} "[[Klaatu barada nikto]]"{{snd}} he forgets and tries to unsuccessfully mumble and cough "nikto". He then grabs it and rushes back, while the dead and his evil copy resurrect, uniting into the Army of Darkness.

Upon return, Ash demands to be returned to his own time. However, Sheila is abducted by a Flying Deadite, and later transformed into one. Ash becomes determined to lead the humans against the Army and the people reluctantly agree. Using knowledge from textbooks in his 1973 [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile Delta 88]], and enlisting the help of Duke Henry, Ash successfully leads the medieval soldiers to victory over the Deadites and Evil Ash, saving Sheila and bringing peace between Arthur and Henry. The Wise Men tells him how to return to the present by giving him a potion after reciting the phrase.

Back in his present time, Ash recounts his story to a fellow employee at an S-Mart department store. As he talks to a woman who is interested in his story, a surviving Deadite, allowed to come to the present due to Ash again forgetting the last word, attacks the customers. Ash kills it using a [[Winchester rifle]] from the Sporting Goods department, and exclaims "hail to the king, baby" before passionately kissing the woman. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movieweb.com/army-of-darkness-bubba-ho-top-comic-ash-elvis-evil-dead/|title=Ash Vs.

===Original ending===
In the film's original ending, Ash miscounts the amount of potion needed to be able to correctly return to his own time. As a result, he wakes up in a post-apocalyptic future where human civilization is destroyed, and he screams in dismay at having overslept. Universal Pictures objected to this climax, feeling that it was too negative in tone, and a more optimistic ending was filmed and ultimately incorporated into the theatrical cut.&lt;ref name="Muir6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/canceled-movie-twists-saved/|title=10 Canceled Twists That Would’ve Saved Movies (And 10 That Would’ve Hurt Them)|author=Leon Miller|date=July 30, 2018|work=ScreenRant|access-date=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/lukethompson/2018/08/21/bruce-campbell-ash-vs-evil-dead-3-sam-raimi-rob-tapert-lucy-lawless-starz/|title=Bruce Campbell Talks 'Ash Vs.

==Production==

===Development===
Plans to make a third ''[[Evil Dead]]'' film had been circulating for a number of years, even prior to the production of ''[[Darkman]]''.&lt;ref name="Muir"&gt;{{cite news | last = Muir | first = John Kenneth | authorlink = John Kenneth Muir | title = The Unseen Force: The Films of Sam Raimi | work = | page = 152 | language = | publisher = Applause | year = 2004 | url =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' made enough money internationally that [[Dino De Laurentiis]] was willing to finance a sequel.&lt;ref name="Muir"/&gt;  Director and script writer [[Sam Raimi]] drew from a variety of sources, including literature with ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'' and [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and films like ''[[The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad]]'', ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'',  [[The Three Stooges]], and  ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan The Barbarian]]''. ''Evil Dead II'', according to [[Bruce Campbell]], "was originally designed to go back into the past to 1300, but we couldn't muster it at the time, so we decided to make an interim version, not knowing if the 1300 story would ever get made".&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;{{cite news | last = Warren | first = Bill | authorlink = Bill Warren (film historian and critic) | title = The Evil Dead Companion | work = | page = 143 | language = | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | year = 2000 | url =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Promotional drawings were created and published in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' during the casting process before the budget was deemed too little for the plot.  The working title for the project was ''Medieval Dead'',before it was later known as''Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness''.&lt;ref name="Warren2"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  The title "Army of Darkness" came from an idea by [[Irvin Shapiro]], during the production of ''Evil Dead II''.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Raimi. DVD audio commentary, 3:12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Screenplay and pre-production===
Initially, Raimi invited [[Scott Spiegel]] to co-write ''Army of Darkness'' because he had done a good job on ''Evil Dead II'', but he was busy on rewrites for the [[Clint Eastwood]] film ''[[The Rookie (1990 film)|The Rookie]]''.&lt;ref name="Warren3"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; After the good experience of writing the screenplay for a film called ''Easy Wheels'', Sam and his brother [[Ivan Raimi|Ivan]] decided to co-write the film together.&lt;ref name="Warren4"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; They worked on the script throughout the pre-production and production of ''Darkman''.&lt;ref name="Muir"/&gt; After filming ''Darkman'', they took the script out and worked on it in more detail. Raimi says that Ivan "has a good sense of character" and that he brought more comedy into the script.&lt;ref name="Warren4"/&gt; Campbell remembers, "We all decided, 'Get him out of the cabin.' There were earlier drafts where part three still took place there, but we thought, 'Well, we all know that cabin, it's time to move on.' The three of us decided to keep it in 1300, because it's more interesting".&lt;ref name="Warren"/&gt; Campbell and Tapert would read the script drafts, give Raimi their notes and he would decide which suggestions to keep and which ones to discard.&lt;ref name="Warren6"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial budget was $8 million but during pre-production, it became obvious that this was not going to be enough.&lt;ref name="Muir"/&gt; ''Darkman'' was also a financial success and De Laurentiis had a multi-picture deal with Universal and so ''Army of Darkness'' became one of the films. The studio decided to contribute half of the film's $12 million budget.&lt;ref name="Warren5"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film's ambitious scope and its extensive effects work forced Campbell, Raimi and producer [[Robert Tapert]] to put up $1 million of their collective salaries to shoot a new ending and not film a scene where a possessed woman pushes down some giant pillars.&lt;ref name="Muir"/&gt; Visual effects supervisor William Mesa showed Raimi storyboards he had from [[Victor Fleming]]'s film ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' that depicted huge battle scenes and he picked out 25 shots to use in ''Army of Darkness''.&lt;ref name="Muir2"/&gt; A storyboard artist worked closely with the director in order to blend the shots from the ''Joan of Arc'' storyboards with the battle scenes in his film.&lt;ref name="Muir2"/&gt;

[[Traci Lords]] was among the actresses auditioning for the film, saying in 2001, "I didn't get the part but I clicked with Bruce [Campbell]," with whom she would later work as a guest star in the TV series ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://scifi.com/transcripts/2001/tracilords.html | title=Traci Lords |publisher= (chat transcript), [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] | date = January 25, 2001 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030729085136/http://scifi.com/transcripts/2001/tracilords.html | archivedate=July 29, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principal photography===
[[Principal photography]] took place between soundstage and on-location work. ''Army of Darkness'' was filmed in [[Bronson Canyon]] and [[Vasquez Rocks|Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park]]. The interior shots were filmed on an [[Front projection|Introvision]] stage in [[Hollywood]]. Raimi's use of the Introvision process was a tribute to the [[stop-motion animation]] work of [[Ray Harryhausen]].&lt;ref name="Muir2"&gt;Muir 2004, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Introvision uses front-projected images with live actors instead of the traditional [[rear projection]] that Harryhausen and others used. Introvision blended components with more realistic-looking results. To achieve this effect, Raimi used 60-foot-tall Scotchlite front-projection screens, miniatures and background plates.&lt;ref name="Muir2"/&gt; According to the director, the advantage of using this technique was "the incredible amount of interaction between the background, which doesn't exist, and the foreground, which is usually your character".&lt;ref name="Robley"&gt;{{cite news | last = Robley | first = Les Paul | authorlink =  | title = Mobilizing ''Army of Darkness'' via "Go-Animation" |work=[[American Cinematographer]] |page = 74 | language = | publisher = | date = March 1993 | url =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shooting began in mid-1991, and it lasted for about 100 days.&lt;ref name="Warren9"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a mid-summer shoot and while on location on a huge castle set that was built near [[Acton, California|Acton]], California on the edge of the [[Mojave Desert]], the cast and crew endured very hot conditions during the day and very cold temperatures at night.&lt;ref name="Muir3"&gt;Muir 2004, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the film took place at night and the filmmakers shot most of the film during the summer when the days were longest and the nights were the shortest. It would take an hour and a half to light an area leaving the filmmakers only six hours left to shoot a scene.&lt;ref name="Warren7"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Money problems forced cinematographer [[Bill Pope]] to shoot only for certain hours Monday through Friday because he could not be paid his standard fee. Mesa shot many of the action sequences on the weekend.&lt;ref name="Muir4"&gt;Muir 2004, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a difficult shoot for Campbell who had to learn elaborate choreography for the battle scenes, which involved him remembering a number system because the actor was often fighting opponents that were not really there.&lt;ref name="Muir5"&gt;Muir 2004, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Mesa remembers, "Bruce was cussing and swearing some of the time because you had to work on the number system. Sam would tell us to make it as complicated and hard for Bruce as possible. 'Make him go through torture!' So we'd come up with these shots that were really, really difficult, and sometimes they would take thirty-seven takes".&lt;ref name="Muir5"/&gt; Some scenes, like Evil Ash walking along the graveyard while his skeleton minions come to life, blended stop-motion animation with live skeletons{{clarify|date=January 2012}} that were mechanically rigged, with prosthetics and visual effects.&lt;ref name="Muir5"/&gt;

===Post-production===
While [[Dino De Laurentiis]] gave Raimi and his crew freedom to shoot the film the way they wanted, Universal took over during post-production.&lt;ref name="Muir6"&gt;Muir 2004, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Universal was not happy with Raimi's cut because it did not like his original ending, feeling it was negative.&lt;ref name="Muir6"/&gt; In this ending, the potion Ash is given causes him to oversleep, and when he wakes up he is a futuristic, post-apocalyptic wasteland. A more upbeat ending was shot a month later in a lumber store in Malibu, California. Then, two months after principal filming was finished, a round of re-shoots began in Santa Monica and involved Ash in the windmill and the scenes with [[Bridget Fonda]].&lt;ref name="Muir6"/&gt; Raimi recalls, "Actually, I kind of like the fact that there are two endings, that in one alternate universe Bruce is screwed, and in another universe he's some cheesy hero".&lt;ref name="Warren11"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Raimi needed $3 million to finish his film, but Universal was not willing to give him the money and delayed its release due to a dispute with De Laurentiis over the rights to the [[Hannibal Lecter]] character which Universal needed so that they could film a [[Hannibal (film)|sequel]] to ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''.&lt;ref name="Muir8"&gt;Muir 2004, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was finally resolved, but the release date for ''Army of Darkness''' was pushed back from summer of 1992 to February 1993.

For the film's poster, Universal brought Campbell in to take several reference head shots and asked him to strike a sly look on his face. They showed him a rough of the [[Frank Frazetta]]-like painting. The actor had a day to approve it or, as he was told, there would be no ad campaign for the film.&lt;ref name="Warren12"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Raimi ran into further troubles when the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] gave it an NC-17 rating for a shot of a female Deadite being decapitated early on in the film. Universal wanted a PG-13 rating, so Raimi made a few cuts and was still stuck with an R rating.&lt;ref name="Warren8"/&gt; In response, Universal turned the film over to outside film editors who cut the film to 81 minutes and another version running 87 minutes that was eventually released in theaters, still with an R rating.&lt;ref name="Warren8"/&gt;

===Music===
[[Danny Elfman]], who composed the score for ''Darkman'', wrote the "March of the Dead" theme for ''Army of Darkness''.&lt;ref name="Warren8"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; After the re-shoots were completed, [[Joseph LoDuca]], who composed the music for ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' and ''[[Evil Dead II]]'', returned to score the film.&lt;ref name="Muir7"&gt;Muir 2004, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  The composer used his knowledge of synthesizers and was able to present many cues in a mock-up form before he recorded them with the [[Seattle Symphony]].&lt;ref name="Warren8"/&gt; The score was released during the [[MondoCon]] in [[Austin, Texas]] on October 3 and 4, 2015, on [[Gramophone record|Vinyl]], over [[Mondo Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barkan|first=Jonathan|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3356356/mondo-announces-army-darkness-vinyl-soundtrack/ |title=Mondo Announces ‘Army Of Darkness’ Vinyl Soundtrack |publisher=Bloody-disgusting.com |date=August 6, 2015 |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time ''Army of Darkness'' turns into a retread of ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'', featuring an army of fighting skeletons, the film has fallen into a ditch between parody and spectacle."&lt;ref name="Gleiberman"&gt;{{cite news | last = Gleiberman | first = Owen | coauthors = | title = ''Army of Darkness'' | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = March 5, 1994 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305759,00.html | accessdate = July 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential sequel==
In March 2013, shortly before the release of ''[[Evil Dead (2013 film)|Evil Dead]]'', a reboot and loose continuation of the franchise, Raimi confirmed that the next ''Evil Dead'' film will be ''Army of Darkness 2''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2909">A '''''badchen''''' or '''''badkhn''''' (a Hebrew word meaning [[jester]] that has been Yiddishized as ''badchen'') is a [[Jewish]] comedian with scholarly overtones who entertained guests at weddings among the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]] of [[Eastern Europe]]. Today they are found in all countries with [[Hasidic Judaism|Chassidic]] populations, including the [[United States]], performing their [[shtick]] at weddings.

The ''badchen'' was considered a standard part of the wedding party, as ''de rigueur'' as the officiating [[rabbi]]. An elaborate traditional wedding might also involve a ''letz'' (lit. a clown, here a ''jongleur'' or musician) and a ''marshalik'' (a master of ceremonies).&lt;ref name=Liptzin&gt;[[Sol Liptzin|Liptzin, Sol]], ''A History of Yiddish Literature'', Jonathan David Publishers, Middle Village, NY, 1972, {{ISBN|0-8246-0124-6}}, 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''badchen'' has to be able both to provide the energy for a party before and after the ceremony itself and also to make the transition to a more serious tone immediately before the ceremony.&lt;ref name=Liptzin/&gt;  To this end his comedy was not of a [[slapstick]] variety but rather verbal with many intricate [[Talmud]]ic references and [[in-joke]]s.

Following the Council of Vilna on July 3, 1661, a decree was issued banning merry-making, including the setting of limitations on wedding celebrations, public drinking, fire dances, masquerades, and Jewish comic entertainers. The ''badchen'' was exempted from the decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gordon | first = Mel | title = Catastrophe in Ukraine, Comedy Today | newspaper = Reform Judaism | pages = 50–51 | date = Spring 2011 | accessdate = 2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some famous ''badchonim'' include [[Chaim Menachem Mermelstien|Chaim Menachem (Mendel) Mermelstein]] (born March 2, 1920 in [[Mukachevo|Munkacz]], died November 7, 1985 in [[New York City|New York]]), considered the father of modern-day ''badchonus'',{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and the present-day performers [[Yankel Miller]] and [[Yoel Lebowits]].

The 19th-century [[Broder singer]]s began as ''badchonim'', but soon started to perform outside of the context of weddings. They, in turn, are usually seen as the forerunners of [[Yiddish theater]].

On the Jewish holiday of [[Purim]] many young men undertake to be ''badchonim'' during [[Purim spiel]]s.

'''The Bloor Street Culture Corridor'''  is a cluster of arts and cultural organizations in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. It is located on [[Bloor Street|Bloor St. W]], between [[Bathurst Street (Toronto)|Bathurst]] and [[Bay Street|Bay]] Streets.

The Bloor Street Culture Corridor has a wide variety of art genres, from museum experiences to films, art exhibitions to music concerts. The area also is culturally diverse, including Aboriginal, French, Jewish, Italian, Japanese, Estonian, African and Caribbean arts and culture.

Officially launched in April 2014,&lt;ref name="star-ann"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2014/03/27/twelve_bloor_st_arts_institutions_form_new_culture_corridor.html|title=Twelve Bloor St. arts institutions form new 'Culture Corridor'|author=Eastwood, Joel|date=27 March 2014|publisher=Toronto Star|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the collective shares a website, [[social media]] and a [[mobile app]] to promote exhibitions at its member institutions. In 2016, the Corridor was successful in working with the [[City of Toronto]] to have the section of Bloor St. West designated an official City of Toronto cultural corridor. Each year more than three million persons visit the Corridor's arts and culture destinations, and attend exhibitions, performances, and events. Together, the Bloor St. Culture Corridor organizations employ more than 5,500 culture workers and generate more than $629,500,000 in economic impact each year.

'''Books For Africa''' is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit organization]] dedicated to collecting, sorting, shipping, and distributing books to children and adults in Africa. With headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota, USA, and warehouses in St. Paul and Atlanta, Georgia, BFA's mission is to end the book famine in Africa. Books For Africa is the largest shipper of donated text and library books to the African continent, shipping over 28 million books to 49 different countries since 1988.  In 2012 BFA shipped 2.2 million books valued at $28.3 million to 22 African countries, with an additional 616 computers and 15 brand new law libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.booksforafrica.org/index.html|title=Books For Africa|website=Books for Africa|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Books For Africa has received the top rating of 4 stars from [[Charity Navigator]].org&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=3373#.UnFaoF8o7cs|title=Charity Navigator - Rating for Books For Africa|website=Charity Navigator|language=en|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and meets all standards set by the Charities Review Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smartgivers.org/|title=Charities Review Council: Where Donors and Nonprofits Meet|website=Charities Review Council|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order to cover shipping costs ($10,300 to ship a 40-foot container with approximately 22,000 books to an African seaport), Books For Africa relies on donations and partners with [[Better World Books]], a social venture company that runs book drives to raise funding for literacy-based nonprofits. Better World Books is their largest single source of funding and their largest source of post-secondary books.

'''Cyber PowWow''' is an Aboriginally determined online gallery with digital artworks and a library of texts. It was conceived in 1996 and was live online from 1997 to 2004 in four main iterations. Cyber PowWow was part webspace and part chatroom, and all artwork displayed on the website was created specifically for Cyber PowWow. The website was hosted in Time Warner's "[[The Palace (computer program)|The Palace]]," a popular and influential chat room of the late 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref name="Gaertner 55–78"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaertner|first=David|date=2016-04-15|title=Indigenous in Cyberspace: CyberPowWow,God's Lake Narrows, and the Contours of Online Indigenous Territory|url=http://uclajournals.org/doi/10.17953/aicrj.39.4.gaertner|journal=American Indian Culture and Research Journal|language=EN|volume=39|issue=4|pages=55–78|doi=10.17953/aicrj.39.4.gaertner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First Cyper PowWow exhibition ==
For the first Cyber PowWow event Six aboriginal artists and writers were invited to create work for the first Cyber PowWow event. The exhibition was launched with a simultaneous, distributed chat event. Participating artists, writers, and the wider public were invited to log on to the Palace to engage artists and visitors in discussions about the artwork. Skawennati Tricia Fragnito, one of the developers of Cyber PowWow, and Jason Lewis state that, "the event was successful in terms of the Aboriginal art and issues it brought into a public venue," but that, "critical dialogue was often interrupted by 'non-participants' drifting in from other chat rooms."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fragnito|first=Skawennati Tricia|date=|year=|title=Aboriginal Territories in Cyberspace|url=https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/canada/aboriginal-territories-cyberspace|journal=|language=EN|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cyber PowWow 2 ==
Cyber PowWow 2 signaled the launch of a separate Palace unique to Cyber PowWow. Eight Aboriginal artists and writers customized the chat space with imagery, scripts, and a variety of Indian avatars. Artists presented their work and answered questions about it from an enthusiastic audience composed largely of people from the Canadian contemporary art community. The participants included Ahasiw Maskegon-Iskwew, Sheryl Kootenhayoo, who contributed a Quicktime virtual reality piece, and [[Lori Blondeau]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gallery: CyberPowWow2|url=http://www.cyberpowwow.net/gallery.html|website=CyberPowWow|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who created and led a virtual round dance.&lt;ref name="Gaertner 55–78"/&gt;

== CPW 2K: Cyber PowWow Goes Global ==
The third incarnation of Cyber PowWow included not only Canadian and American artists, but, for the first time, Australian artists as well as non-Native artists. The Aboriginal participants were joined by Mare Burgess, a white feminist researcher who studies Indian warrior women, and Sheila Urbanoski, a white artists who grew up in a town bordering a reserve. Skawennati Tricia Fragnito remarked in her curatorial essay: "Now that we have marked our territory, built a Palace and furnished it, it is time to invite in our neighbours: digital artists in the non-Native world. These friends, collaborators, and kindred spirits can talk about the very topic that we are engendering: Aboriginal meets non-Aboriginal."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Emaux de Briare'''  is a French company specializing today in mosaics. Whilst the manufactory in [[Briare]] originally started with earthenware pottery, the factory founded in Paris by Jean-Félix Bapterosses (1813–1885) initially began manufacturing porcelain buttons in 1845. They merged in 1851, at which date its international development started:  1851 in [[The Great Exhibition]], UK and as early as  1853 in the United States. It's current American subsidiary is located in [[Copiague]] NY.

==History==

===Early years===

The company began as  '''Bapterosses &amp; Cie''' of [[Paris, France]], which was established to manufacture and sell porcelain buttons made according to a method quite similar to the one patented by Richard Prosser in 1840, but following the invention of a device that could mold 500 buttons at a time vs. only one at the competing English factory,&lt;ref&gt;Ornament 1995 p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mintons]] (which had acquired the rights to the original patent) thanks to a new formulation of the paste in which milk was added to the slip to improve plasticity.&lt;ref&gt;Nourisson p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;
Jean-Félix Bapterosses was hence named Officer of the French [[Legion of Honor]] in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Nourisson p.33&lt;/ref&gt; His bust, sculpted by [[Henri Chapu]] and founded by [[Ferdinand Barbedienne]] is now exhibited in the ''museum of enamel &amp; mosaics'' in Briare.

===Today===
[[File:Cruz-Diez Marlin Ballpark Miami.jpg|thumb|226x226px|left | ''Chromatic Induction in a Double Frequency''  Marlins Ballpark,  Miami, with Briare mosaics.]]
Today émaux de Briare sells its mosaics across the world for small and large projects alike, one of the latest ones being the walkways for the new [[Miami Marlins]] stadium, designed by Venezuelan artist [[Carlos Cruz-Diez]]. It currently operates from its US headquarters in [[Bay Shore, New York|Bayshore]] NY for the North American market.

==Products==

===Buttons===

Bapterosses &amp; Cie was bent on efficiency and multiplied inventions to boost productivity.&lt;ref&gt;China buttons p.9-14&lt;/ref&gt; For instance in 1858 (US letters of patent N°19,120), they invented buttons with shanks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buttoncountry.com/%60PatentsbyPage/Patent%20Pages/1858_Enamel%20and%20Porcelain.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scientific American, 30th January 1858&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Bapterosses was also a precocious marketing man in the sense that he immediately advertised his products under the ''FB'' brand &lt;ref&gt;Buttons p.74-76&lt;/ref&gt; and associated it with the numerous medals &amp; awards he had received the world over.

===Beads===

With the growing colonial thrust a new market appeared notably in Africa for fancy beads.&lt;ref&gt;Nourisson&lt;/ref&gt; The models made included faceted beads, mother-of-pearl beads and [[chevron bead]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Chevron beads p.11&lt;/ref&gt; They were also used for trading with Native Americans in the second half of the 19th century, as well as for the fashion conscious ladies of the time.

[[File:Perles vrac anciennes.jpg|thumb|"mother of pearl" type beads in Émaux de Briare]]

===Mosaics===

With the [[Art nouveau]] movement, there was a revival of interest in mosaics. Émaux de Briare introduced a new concept of pre-cut mosaics &lt;ref&gt;Nourisson p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; that would make it much cheaper to adorn buildings, than with the traditional method. When the [[Art deco]] movement came, Emaux de Briare adapted and worked with then trendy architects such as [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]], (bathroom in [[Villa Cavrois]] for instance. Later emaux de Briare mosaics were also much used in the [[Op art]] movement, notably by [[Victor Vasarely]] or [[Yaacov Agam]]. Today, Briare mosaics are used by street artists, such as the French [[Invader (artist)|Invader]].

==Markets==

===The American market===

In 1853, the buttons were exhibited in the [[Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations]] in [[New York City]]. In 1876, beads appeared in the [[Centennial Exposition]] in [[Philadelphia]] at which time the company was awarded a prize medal. Then in Chicago, in 1893, the mosaics appeared in the [[World's Columbian Exposition]].

The main customers in the latter part of the 19th century were:
* Howard, Sanger Co's dry goods store at 105-107 Chambers Street, New York.
* Louis B. Binsse &amp; Co's fancy goods store at 83 William Street in New York.
* Dieckerhoff, Raffloer at 560 Broadway, New York.
* Ostheimer Bros. in Philadelphia, PA.&lt;ref&gt;Nourisson p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Certificat Philadelphie 1876.jpg|thumb|Award, Philadelphia, PA - 1876 for Bapterosses &amp; Cie]]

===Other markets===

Emaux de Briare exhibited in numerous world exhibitions:
Paris in 1855, honor medal ; London in 1862 « prize medal »  ; [[Porto]] in 1865,  "gloria victoribus" medal ; Paris in 1867, gold medal and in 1878 Grand Prize ; [[Vienna]] in 1873, medal; [[Sydney]] in 1879 ; [[Melbourne]] in 1880; [[Amsterdam]] in 1883, medal; [[Antwerp]] in 1885, gold medal ;  Paris in 1889 « Grand Prize ».

Emaux de Briare beads were especially successful in Africa in the latter part of the 19th century, because of their regular appearance imitating ancient beads.&lt;ref&gt;''a handbook on beads'' p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''essay mill''' (also '''term paper mill''') is a business that allows customers to commission an original piece of writing on a particular topic so that they may commit [[academic fraud]]. Customers provide the company with specific information about the essay, including: a page length, a general topic, and a time frame with which to work. The customer is then charged a certain amount per page.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt; The similar '''essay bank''' concept is a company from which students can purchase pre-written but less expensive essays on various topics, at higher risk of being caught. Both forms of business are under varying legal restraints in some jurisdictions.

==History==
The idea behind term paper mills can be dated back to the mid-nineteenth century in which "paper reservoirs" were located in the basements of fraternity houses. Otherwise known as "fraternity files," these essay banks were practices in which students shared term papers and submitted work that had been done by other students.&lt;ref name="Stavisky"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stavisky |first=Leonard Price |title=Term Paper 'Mills', Academic Plagiarism, and State Regulation |journal=Political Science Quarterly |date=1973 |pages=445–461}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=August 2015|reason=volume, issue, and month missing, so source cannot be verified.}} These essay banks inspired the commercialization of [[ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] essay-writing practices. As early as the 1950s, advertisements were circulating college campus that described services that included ghostwritten work for [[Doctoral dissertation|dissertations]], [[Master's thesis|theses]], and [[term paper]]s.&lt;ref name="Stavisky" /&gt;

In conjunction with this practice, the changing attitudes of students in the 1960s and 1970s started to stray away from diligent and engaged course work because they saw an emphasis on the benefits of community involvement. A new focus on activities outside of the classroom took away from time to focus on class work, thus promoting these writing services throughout college campuses.&lt;ref name="Stavisky" /&gt;

Soon, actual businesses were providing custom-written essays for students in exchange for compensation. They were located near college campuses.&lt;ref name="Pemberton"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pemberton|first=Michael |title=Threshold of Desperation: Winning the Fight Against Term Paper Mills |journal=Writing Instructor |date=March 1992 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=143–152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One could walk into a building and peruse pricing pamphlets,  speak to someone directly to place an order, or possibly make a selection from a vault of recycled research papers stored in the basement of these businesses.&lt;ref name="Stavisky" /&gt;

==Products and services==
"Essay mill" companies hire university students, graduates, and professional writers to ghostwrite essays and term papers, and solicit business from university and college students by posting advertisements. Until the early 1990s, most essay mill companies were 'bricks and mortar' businesses offering their services by mail-order or from offices located in university or college towns.&lt;ref name="Pemberton" /&gt; By the 2000s, most essay mill businesses have switched to an [[e-commerce]] business model, soliciting business and selling essays using an Internet website.  Companies often provide free sample essays on popular topics to attract Internet searches.

To obtain an essay, a customer usually submits a form that describes the assignment that he or she wants completed, how many pages it needs to be, and when it needs to be completed by. On the opposite end of the transaction, the employee searches through requests until he or she finds something that sparks their interest. A writer will take anything that they know they can write something that will be quick and hit the page requirement. It does not matter if the writer has previous knowledge about the subject; if it is easy to research, he or she will get the job done.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt;

Depending on how much a student pays an essay mill, a student can receive a number of different products. The most expensive of these products would be a full-written essay (or even a dissertation) that a student can turn in. Requested papers can follow specific guidelines laid out by the student including the use of a certain amount of sources, a preselected topic, and the receiving of specific grade by the student. Some students may request to receive a high mark on a purchased essay in order to boost their Grade Point Average (GPA), while some may deliberately order an essay that will give them a "C" in order to reduce suspicion of academic fraud. One of the cheaper options an essay mill might offer is just a detailed outline of information a student should include in an essay that a student will write themselves. Due to the nature of this type of transaction, purchasing an outline is very hard for schools to catch as a form of an academic dishonesty.

Similar to essay mills, an '''essay bank''' is a company where students can go to purchase pre-written essays.  Due to the nature of essay bank essays, students may find themselves more likely to be caught for committing academic dishonesty. As a result of this, essay bank essays in general may cost less than those from essay mills.

==Legal status==

Although essay mills and the students who use them are considered unethical by many educational professionals, they do not violate copyright law; the mill is the legal copyright holder of the papers, and the papers are licensed to paying students for limited use.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  The mill may, however, hold the student legally responsible in the case where they redistribute the paper to other students without the permission of the mill.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In informal settings where students exchange papers without any formal licensing or transfer of copyright, copyright violation may occur, but it is unlikely that the students will press charges, since they would incriminate themselves by doing so.{{Citation needed|reason=Parts of this paragraph seem to express a legal opinion. Whose opinion is it?|date=May 2014}}

In some countries, essay mills are legally allowed to operate because of the way in which they describe their services.  Essay mills state that the papers that they produce are not intended to be submitted for credit, but rather to be used by the customer to generate ideas to his or her own paper.  When asked if their services are considered cheating, one online company states that, "No, it’s not.  Dealing with us is pretty much like going to the library, where we would be acting as a helpful librarian helping you get enough material for a good grade. We are only offering you to make use of our take on your assignment and the results of our research on your paper's topic."  The company is not responsible if the customer submits the essay verbatim for credit because that goes against the company’s terms of use.

While there is no federal law against the operation of essay mills, there are over a dozen individual states in the US that have their own laws against them.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  The first major legal battle against an essay mill came in 1972 in the case of ''State of New York v. {{sic|hide=y|reason=Yes, it's "Saksniit", not "Saksnitt", etc.|Saksniit}}''.&lt;ref name="NY vs. Saksniit"&gt;Decision, [http://www.leagle.com/decision/197262369Misc2d554_1483.xml/STATE%20OF%20NEW%20YORK%20v.%20SAKSNIIT State of New York v. Saksniit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063159/http://www.leagle.com/decision/197262369Misc2d554_1483.xml/STATE%20OF%20NEW%20YORK%20v.%20SAKSNIIT |date=March 4, 2016 }}, 69 Misc.2d 554 (1972). New York State Supreme Court, Special Term, New York County. April 18, 1972. Via Leagle.com. Accessed: August 12, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  This case involved the state challenging an essay mill's business with reference to the New York Education Law.  The law "condemns the obtaining of a degree by fraudulent means or 'aiding and abetting' another to do the same."&lt;ref name="Jeffes &amp; Janosik"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jeffes|first1=Errin J. |last2=Janosik|first2=Steven M. |title=The Courts' Response to Student Cheating with the Help of Term Paper Mills: Implications for Student Affairs Administrators |journal=College Student Affairs Journal |volume=21 |issue=2 |date=2002 |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state claimed that the students were using the term papers they purchased for credit and even though the company stated that the essays they wrote were for research purposes only, their advertising scheme encouraged otherwise by boasting about grades.&lt;ref name="NY vs. Saksniit" /&gt; The court determined that the disclaimers did not sufficiently protect the company because their encouragement of cheating and plagiarism hurt the educational system.  The ruling called for the company to cease business in the State of New York.&lt;ref name="Jeffes &amp; Janosik" /&gt; Several other legal battles have been fought since and have largely resulted in the punishment of the term paper writers rather than the students purchasing them.

California Education Code Section 66400 "penalizes the preparation or sale of term papers, thesis, or dissertations for compensation ...." The law is applicable when the preparer/seller knew or should have known that the recipient would submit the paper for academic credit.  State residents or academic institutions "acting for the interest of itself, its students, or the general public" can file suit against offenders for "any relief as is necessary."&lt;ref name="Mocello"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mocello |first=Marie |title=Essay Mills 101: Selling College Term Papers Online May Be a Crime |work=Yahoo Contributor Network: Yahoo Voices |date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|certain=y|date=August 2015|reason=User-generated content.}}{{dead link|date=August 2015|reason=YCN/YV doesn't even exist any more; see http://searchengineland.com/panda-strikes-yahoo-voices-yahoo-contributor-network-closing-195698}} This law differs from that of New York in various ways, including holding the vendor responsible even if it claims that the paper was not intended to be turned in for credit, if the court concludes that it should have known that it would, or if the claim is not credible. For example, while some essay mills state that their products are not intended to be submitted for credit, they may also boast of the high grades that their papers have received.

The 2011 Florida Statutes Section 877.17 states that it is a second degree [[misdemeanor]] to "sell, offer to sell, or advertise for sale" a "written, recorded, pictorial, artistic, or other assignment" to another for submission "unaltered to a substantial degree."&lt;ref name="Mocello" /&gt; In the state of Florida, second degree misdemeanors are punishable by up to sixty days in prison.

==Criticism and controversy==
The [[academic community]] has criticized essay mill companies for helping students to commit academic fraud.

Some essay mills have defended themselves against criticism by claiming that they are selling pre-written examples which students can use as guidelines and models for the student's own work. In 2002, a UK-based essay mill called Elizabeth Hall Associates required students purchasing essays to sign a disclaimer stating that "any material provided by Elizabeth Hall Associates [is] on the understanding that it is a guidance model only."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Major|first=Lee Elliot |title=Web of Deceit |url= https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/jan/08/highereducation.students |accessdate=May 15, 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=8 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other essay mills claim that they are "scholarly publishing houses" that provide students with essays that the student can then cite in the student's own work.

Students from different academic backgrounds have used essay mills.  Many prestigious universities and colleges have caught their students turning in papers they bought from essay mills.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt;  The University of California, San Diego caught 600 students cheating in one year.  One of the forms of cheating was turning in papers bought from essay mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Ruff|first1=Bob|last2=Costello|first2=Carol |title=Educating America: Cheating on Papers is a Booming Web Business |work=American Morning Blogs |publisher=CNN |url= http://am.blogs.cnn.com/2009/12/30/cheating-on-papers-is-a-booming-web-business |ps=&lt;!--This is an official CNN blog, subject to editorial control, not a primary source.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using term paper mills brings up some ethical controversies.  Some people view essay mills as unethical while others view it as completely moral.  People view essay mills as [[ethical]] for different reasons.  Some customers indicate that they use essay mills as a form of proof reading.  Essay mill writers will read their writing only to make comments and feedback about content and grammar mistakes.  They also turn to essay mills to insure that all citations are correct.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt;  Some customers claim that they turn to essay mills because society has put too much pressure on students to achieve academic success. GPAs and grades are greatly stressed in schools which causes students to worry and make them feel like they cannot meet their deadlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Ethics in Computing |website=ethics.csc.ncsu.edu |publisher=North Carolina State University |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url= http://ethics.csc.ncsu.edu/commerce/termpapers/study.php |accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to get the paper handed in on time, students seek out term paper mills.  Essay mills have been compared to business situations.  Certain students and customers view term paper mills as equivalent to companies outsourcing labor.  [[Outsourcing]] labor is a norm for businesses which insinuates that the use of term paper mills should be socially acceptable.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt;

Conversely, there are people who view purchasing essays from essay mills as unethical: it is a form of cheating and plagiarism because one person is taking credit of another individual’s work.  Academic institutions are concerned about how essay mills affect learning.  Students who use essay mills do not go through the process of gathering research, which is a learning experience in itself.  Some professors, such as Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University and the author of ''The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty'', worry about the message term paper mills send to students.  He believes the existence of essay mills validates slacking off.  Ariely has come across essay mills use plagiarism-encouraging language on their websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Ariely |first=Dan |title=Essay Mills – A Coarse Lesson on Cheating |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 2012 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/17/opinion/la-oe-ariely-cheating-20120617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students generally know that using essay mill services is not right; according to a study conducted Patrick Scanlon and David Neumann, 90% of students surveyed admitted that the practice is unethical. However, the same study showed that students believe around 20% of their peers frequently use these online services.&lt;ref name="Scanlon &amp; Neumann"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scanlon|first1=Patrick |last2=Neumann|first2=David |title=Internet Plagiarism among College Students |journal=Journal of College Student Development |date=2002 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=374–386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many customers believe that when they are ordering an essay [[online]], that they are going to be receiving one from their own country; however, this is not always the case, as many essay mill companies are hosted around the world.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bartlett |first=Thomas |title=Cheating Goes Global as Essay Mills Multiply |journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=March 2009 |url= http://chronicle.com/article/Cheating-Goes-Global-as-Essay/32817/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only are many of the essay mill companies hosted overseas, but many of the writers for these companies do not have graduate degrees, and have learned English as their second language.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt;

Having essay mills set up overseas allows for the owners of these companies to make high profits by paying wages in low-wage countries while selling the work of their employees in high-wage countries. A 2009 article in [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] stated that overseas writers only get paid between $1 and $3 per page out of the $20 to $30 US-customers pay per page.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt; Compared to American writers that work for essay mills, this is a very low rate. Another article in ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'' from 2010 interviewed an American essay mill writer, who stated that he makes half of what the paper sells for.&lt;ref name="Dante"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dante |first=Ed |title=The Shadow Scholar |journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=November 2010 |url= http://chronicle.com/article/The-Shadow-Scholar/125329/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in the US, the amount that writers get paid can vary. Some American writers are only able to bring in around $1,000 per month in their highest paying months which can make some writers have to take up a second job.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt; Other American writers are more successful when working for essay mills. Some of the better writers are able to make up to $5,000 per month.&lt;ref name="Dante" /&gt;

==Strategies for combating academic fraud==
Universities and colleges have developed several strategies to combat this type of [[academic misconduct]]. Some professors require students to submit electronic versions of their term papers, so that the text of the essay can be compared by anti-plagiarism software (such as [[Turnitin]]) against databases of known "essay mill" term papers.

Other universities have enacted rules allowing professors to give students [[oral examination]]s on papers which a professor believes to be ghostwritten; if the student is unfamiliar with the content of an essay that  he has submitted, or its sources, then the student can be charged with academic fraud, a violation of the rules by which a student agrees to be bound when he enters a university or college program.

When a student is charged with academic fraud, his case is typically heard by a quasi-judicial administrative committee, which reviews the evidence. For students who are found guilty, the punishments range from a grade of zero on the specific assignment, to failure in the course in which the plagiarism occurred, to (in extreme or repeated cases) suspension or expulsion from the institution. In some cases, students who have committed academic fraud may also have academic honors, degrees, or awards revoked.

The '''''Fano Altarpiece''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Pietro Perugino]], executed in 1497, and housed in the church of  Santa Maria Nuova, [[Fano]], central Italy. It also includes a [[lunette]] with a ''Pietà'' and several [[predella]] panels.

Perugino had already painted an ''[[Annunciation (Perugino, Fano)|Annunciation]]'' in 1488-1490. Several scholars have supposed that a young [[Raphael]] collaborated on the predella.
[[File:Pietro Perugino cat45a.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Lunette.]]

==Description==
The Madonna is portrayed on a luminous landscape of hills, on a high throne; in front of her is a pedestal with, on it, a mystic vase, and featuring the signature and date, which were always added by Perugino when the painting was produced in his workshop and then shipped to the destination. Mary holds the Child in the same fashion of the [[Decemviri Altarpiece]] of 1495-1496.

At the sides are the saints John the Baptist (with a camel skin and a stick with the cross), [[St. Louis of Toulouse|Louis of Toulouse]], who wears a bishop dress, Francis of Assisi (reading), Peter with the Keys of Heaven, Paul (with a long beard and a red vest) and Mary Magdalene with offerings to the Madonna. The portico is a typical element of Perugino's paintings of the period, such as the [[Albani Torlonia Polyptych]]; also typical of his late works is the Madonna's figure as a more mature woman, different than the elegantly youthful portrayal painted before. Less usual are the differentiated proportions of the saints and of the Madonna herself.

The lunette depicts Jesus raised from his sepulchre  by [[Joseph of Arimathea]] and Nicodemus, with Mary and John the Apostle at the sides. The predella includes the scenes of the ''Nativity of Mary'', the ''Presentation of Jesus at the Temple'', the ''Marriage of the Virgin'', the ''Annunciation'' and the ''Assumption''. In these secondary paintings Perugino used some of his typical themes, including the portico and the oval in a valley.

[[File:The Fine Art Society 9906158113.jpg|thumb|The Fine Art Society, London]]
The '''Fine Art Society''' is a gallery in Dundas Street in [[Edinburgh]]'s [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] (originally Bourne Fine Art, established 1978). The [[New Bond Street]], [[London]] gallery closed its doors in August 2018 after being occupied by The Fine Art Society since February 1876, the entrance facade of which was built in 1881 by [[Edward William Godwin]] (1833–1886).

==History==
Founded in 1876 by a group of like-minded men led by William Longman of the publishing family, [[Marcus Bourne Huish]] (1843–1904), lawyer, editor, writer and collector, who became the first Managing Director while at the same time editing ''[[The Art Journal]]''; and [[Archibald Stuart-Wortley (politician)|Archibald Stuart-Wortley MP]].  The gallery, first managed by Ernest Brown (later founder of [[Leicester Galleries]]) has for many years largely concentrated on British art and design from 1600 to the present day; with the Edinburgh premises specialising in Scottish art of the same period. The Edinburgh branch of the company is directed by Emily Walsh.  The Chairmen were all drawn from the Longman family until the death of Mark Longman in 1972. Since then only Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden KT (until 1998), Sir Angus Grossart (until 2016) and Robin Holland-Martin (current) have held the position. Only seven people have held the position of Managing Director in the past 139 years, the last being Pippa Stockdale.

The Fine Art Society has taken part in key international art fairs over the years, most notably at [[TEFAF]] Maastricht, Masterpiece, London, [[Frieze Masters]], London and at the [[London Original Print Fair]], whose founder and chairman, Gordon Cooke, is also the society's 19th and 20th century prints specialist. The society has also exhibited in art fairs in New York, Miami, Hong Kong, Paris and Dubai.

==Exhibitions==
The gallery is also known as the pioneer of the one-man exhibition, most famously that of [[James McNeill Whistler]]'s First Venice Set of etchings in December 1880; the gallery having sent Whistler to [[Venice]] in 1879 in part to enable him to escape from the issues following his libel action against [[John Ruskin]]. The commission was for Whistler to travel to Venice for three months to create a series of twelve etchings. Beguiled by the city, he stayed for fourteen months and completed approximately fifty etchings. Venice also inspired Whistler to make some hundred works in pastel, of which 53 were shown in the Venice Pastels exhibition in 1881. During Whistler's absence in Venice, the gallery showed his antagonist John Ruskin's private Collection of Watercolours by [[J. M. W. Turner]], and ran a subscription to pay for Ruskin's legal costs: a supreme exhibition of political sleight of hand. Other living exhibitors at the London premises included [[Sir John Everett Millais]], [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Burne-Jones]], [[Frank Brangwyn]], [[Walter Richard Sickert]], [[Walter Crane]], [[George Washington Lambert]], [[Henry Charles Brewer]] and [[Joseph Southall]], and more recently [[Leonard Rosoman]], Emma Sargent, [[Emily Young]], [[John Byrne (playwright)|John Byrne]], [[Alexander Stoddart]] and Geoffrey Clarke.  Of many memorial exhibitions held,  one was for [[Lady Alma Tadema]] in 1910.

A Contemporary gallery was created in 2005, originally managed by Toby Clarke, subsequently by [[Kate Bryan]], and most recently by Lee Cavaliere. Sara Terzi is now the Contemporary art specialist at the gallery. The Contemporary team have embraced the nineteenth and twentieth century heritage of the gallery and increased cross-cultural links, particularly in Asia, Australia and the US. Among the artists shown are [[Chris Levine]], Angela Palmer, [[Annie Kevans]], [http://thefineartsociety.com/artists/35-jacky-tsai/overview/ Jacky Tsai] and [http://thefineartsociety.com/artists/27-bartholomew-beal/overview/ Bartholomew Beal].

In October 2014 The Fine Art Society Contemporary staged the first exhibition to be held at the gallery across all 5 floors, 'What Marcel Duchamp Taught Me.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://howtospendit.ft.com/art/65691-what-marcel-duchamp-taught-me|title = What Marcel Duchamp Taught Me|website = How To Spend It|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/09/marcel-duchamp-exhibition-celebrate-father-conceptual-art|title = Marcel Duchamp: exhibition to celebrate father of conceptual art|last = Brown|first = Mark|date = 2014-10-09|last2 = correspondent|first2 = arts|newspaper = The Guardian|language = en-GB|issn = 0261-3077|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition featured artwork by 50 contemporary global artists including [[Peter Blake (artist)|Sir Peter Blake]], [[Cornelia Parker]], [[Gavin Turk]], [[Chris Levine]], [[Conrad Shawcross]], [[Keith Tyson]], [[Michael Craig-Martin]], [[Jonathan Yeo]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Idris Khan]], [[Annie Kevans]] and [[Charming Baker.]] The exhibition curated by [[Kate Bryan]] was one of the most successful in the history of the gallery&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/artists-to-pay-respects-to-marcel-duchamp-in-new-exhibition-9773803.html|title = Artists to pay respects to the revolutionary Marcel Duchamp in new|website = The Independent|language = en-GB|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and marked 100 years since [[Marcel Duchamp]] created the [[Found object|readymade]].

The '''Flag of the Hispanicity''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Bandera de la Hispanidad''){{efn-lr|Formerly known as "Flag of the Hispanic race" (Spanish: ''Bandera de la raza hispánica'')}} is a [[flag]] sometimes used to represent the [[Hispanic]] people or [[Hispanidad|Hispanic community]].&lt;ref&gt;Raeside, Rob (ed.) (2008). [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/int-raza.html "Flag of the Race"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
{{Unsourced section|date=September 2017}}
The Flag of the Hispanicity displays a white background with three purple crosses and a rising sun. 

*The white [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|field]] or background symbolizes peace and purity.
*The [[Gold (color)|golden]] [[Inti]] [[Solar symbol|sun]] symbolizes the awakening of the new lands.
*The three [[cross pattée|crosses pattée]] symbolize [[Christopher Columbus]]'s three ships, the ''[[Niña]]'', the ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'', and the ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]''.
*The [[Purpure]] color of the [[cross]]es represents the [[Spanish language]] and comes from the ancient use of this color in the lion of the [[Kingdom of León]]'s flag, which was later incorporated with the [[Crown of Castile]].

==History==
The flag was designed by Ángel Camblor, a [[Captain (land and air)|captain]] of the [[Uruguayan Army]]. He was the winner of a contest organized by [[Juana de Ibarbourou]] in 1932. The flag was first raised in [[Montevideo]], at the Independence Square, on October 12, 1932.

==Alternative use as the Flag of the Americas==
The flag is also sometimes occasionally alternately used to represent the entire geographical area of [[The Americas]] and not just as an [[ethnic flag]] of the [[Hispanic America]]n people.&lt;ref&gt;''Compton's Encyclopedia'', 1958 edition. See Volume F, section "Flags of the World"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raeside, Rob (ed.) (2008). [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/int-raza.html "Flag of the Americas"] (See final paragraph at the end of the web page.)&lt;/ref&gt; The flag was officially adopted as the ''Flag of the Americas''—in this usage representing besides Hispanic Americans also [[Anglo-America|Anglo-Americans]], [[French colonization of the Americas|Franco-Americans]] (the [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]], [[Haiti]]ans, [[Guadeloupe|Guadeloupians]], [[Martinique|Martininqians]], and [[French Guiana|French Guianians]]), [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Luso-Americans]], [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch Americans]] (the inhabitants of the [[Dutch Antilles]] and [[Suriname]]), and  [[Greenlanders]]—by all member countries of the [[Pan-American Conference]] at their Seventh Assembly in 1933.

'''Fred G. Sanford''' is a [[fictional character]] portrayed by actor/comedian [[Redd Foxx]] on the 1972–1977 [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Sanford and Son]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Fred Sanford: Stubborn, Sharp-Witted, Smart|work= NPR|date=|url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90188763|accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1980–1981 NBC sitcom ''[[Sanford (TV series)|Sanford]]''.&lt;ref name="broadcasting19800218"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1980-02-18|title=Networks cutting up the year into four seasons|journal=Broadcasting|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foxx, whose real name was John Elroy Sanford, modeled the character after his real-life older brother, Fred Glenn Sanford (Fred died in 1965, seven years before the show premiered). The character Fred is an elderly, widowed, sarcastic, and cantankerous junk dealer. He is the proprietor of "Sanford and Son", a junk and antique dealership which he runs out of his home, along with his son Lamont. Foxx appeared in all episodes of the series except nine (due to a contract dispute Foxx had with [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]]) in 1974.

In 1999 ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked him #36 on its list of the 50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TV Guide Guide to TV|year=2004|publisher=Barnes and Noble|isbn=0-7607-5634-1|page=651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Fred G. Sanford was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] on January 20, 1907 (the episode "Happy Birthday, Pop" celebrated his 65th birthday that aired in 1972). In 1946, he, his wife Elizabeth Winfield{{ref|3}} and their son [[Sanford and Son#Lamont Sanford|Lamont]] ([[Demond Wilson]]) moved to the [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Fred was left with the responsibility of rearing Lamont alone after his wife suddenly died the following year. Lamont dropped out of high school, subsequently joining his father in the junk business. Lamont, as he was known, was actually his middle name; Fred and Elizabeth could never decide on a first name. (In another episode, Lamont was known as "Lamont Grady Sanford".)

Fred is portrayed as being irritable and wanting everything done his way. He is known for grouchy disposition, his bad cooking, and his innumerable [[delusions of grandeur]]. He is [[Genu varum|bow-legged]] and walks with an affected stagger, presumably brought on by his (self-diagnosed) arthritis. 

Fred never gives much credit to his son Lamont, believing him to be gullible and unintelligent (often referring to Lamont as a "big dummy"). Unhappy about his calling as a junk man, Lamont accepts his plight more for the love of his father than the junk business itself. Fred often involves himself in various [[get-rich-quick scheme]]s, and as such, Lamont has to keep constant watch over his father. When Lamont would express an interest in having a life for himself, Fred would try to convince him of the importance of running the family business (which he referred to as "the empire") after he is gone. Fred often feigned illness in attempt to guilt his son into staying home and taking care of him whenever Lamont had plans to go out. Similarly, Fred often ruined Lamont's efforts to have a quiet romantic night at home with a lady companion (at one point, Fred repeatedly interrupted Lamont's amorous efforts so often that the young lady ended up sneaking away while Fred and Lamont argued loudly in the kitchen).

==Personality==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}

===Reactions===
When asked over the phone for his name, he frequently responds, "Fred Sanford. That's S-A-N-F-O-R-D period" or "Fred G. Sanford. The 'G' is for...", with "G" standing for a word applicable to the situation. Some instances have included "gonna cry", "genius", "gee", "grandpa","gompergoo" and as Lamont himself once said in the episode, "The Reverend Sanford", "Glory glory, Hallelujah".  It is never revealed what the "G" actually stands for in his name. In one episode, Lamont's full name was said to be "Lamont Grady Sanford," a clue that Fred G. Sanford could be "Fred Grady Sanford." Another trademark involves Fred becoming riled by somebody, assuming a fight stance, and wildly swinging his fists in multiple directions; often he would pose the question, "How would you like one across yo' lip?" or, with fist raised, "How would you like one of these where you sneeze?". He also frequently attempts to avoid any kind of labor, especially when asked by Lamont, by referring to his arthritis (which he pronounced "arthur-itis") while holding up a deliberately gnarled fist. Fred spends much of his free time watching television (having an affinity for [[daikaiju]] films such as the ''[[Godzilla]]'' series) and drinking an alcoholic concoction of his own invention called "Champipple" (a [[portmanteau]] of [[champagne]] and [[Low-end fortified wine|Ripple]]). Another recurring joke is his poor vision; whenever he gets ready to make a phone call, he opens a drawer under the phone and pulls out several pairs of glasses (to help him see the phone dial) and tries each one on. (The pair he picks usually doesn't improve his vision, anyway.) He also often kept valuables or stashes of cash in a secret drawer in that same [[chest of drawers]], which would open after a series of knocks on the dresser and/or foot stamps on the floor.

In what would become the character's best known trademark, when something would alarm him, or when things didn't go the way he wanted them to, Fred would inevitably have a simulated [[heart attack]], accentuated by clutching his chest and crying out to his late wife: "''Oh, this is the big one! You hear that, Elizabeth?! I'm coming to join you, honey!''" (When [[Lena Horne]] guested on the program, and Lamont saw her, he reacted the same way: "I think I'm havin' one, pop! My first one and it's a big one...you hear that, mom? Your little boy's comin' to join ya...with a mustache!")

Fred often clashed with Elizabeth's older sister, Lamont's aunt [[Esther Anderson (fictional character)|Esther Anderson]] ([[LaWanda Page]]). Aunt Esther and her family had opposed Fred's marrying Elizabeth from the very beginning, and Fred and Esther continue their mutual animosity unabated, despite the best efforts of Lamont. Fred makes a habit of teasing Esther because he thinks she is unattractive (Fred once told Esther, "I could stick your face in some dough and make gorilla cookies!"). For her own part, Esther took no sass from Fred, often referring to him as a "heathen", "sucka" and "fish-eyed fool", and she often tried to use her Bible to change Fred's ways (both figuratively and literally; Esther both quoted from the Bible and also often tried to whack Fred with the heavy purse that she carried it in). Much of the show's comedy came from the interplay between opinionated Fred and his strong-willed sister-in-law.

===Prejudices===
Throughout the series' run, Fred (despite being [[African-American]]) was often portrayed as being [[prejudice]]d himself. He often insults his [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] neighbor Julio in various ways, including deprecating his culture and making fun of his accent. He also insults Lamont's Asian friend, Ah Chew, calling him "Choo Choo" and threatening to "really close peanut butter jar" when Ah Chew attempted to hug him. He states at one point that "ain't nothin' on earth uglier than a 90-year-old white woman." His ignorance towards other cultures causes him a severe embarrassment when a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] family, interested in buying Fred's land, invites him and Lamont to dinner. The grown daughter sees him eating what he mistakenly thinks are grapes, and smiles "Oh, Mr. Sanford! I am so happy! You like the [[fish]] [[eye]]s!" Perhaps the biggest affront to Fred's sensibilities came when he discovered his beloved younger sister -- whom he had raised himself after their parents died -- had married a white man (who was also extremely fond of hugging, further earning him Fred's ire). Despite this, one of Fred's closest friends during the series was a [[Jewish]] man named Goldstein; at one point, Fred dons a [[yarmulke]] in order to go over to Goldstein's house and eat chicken soup. During a later episode, Fred attempts to trace his family tree and is mistakenly led to believe he has Jewish ancestry.

===Relationships with women===
Fred was depicted as having an eye for the ladies. In addition to his longtime girlfriend Donna, Fred attempted to hook up with topless waitress "Fast" Fanny, a traveling saleswoman named Carol, and even celebrities such as [[Lena Horne]] and [[Della Reese]]. Fred wasted no opportunities to flirt with attractive women regardless of location or situation, such as nurses (at the clinic where he got screened for [[tuberculosis]], Fred remarked that a nurse had "TB...Terrific Body!"; similarly, when an attractive nurse came into his hospital room offering a back rub to calm him down, Fred immediately began primping once she left the room), stewardesses (a running gag in the episode where Fred takes his first plane trip involved his constant leering at the attractive stewardess whenever she walked away), and receptionists (when the receptionist at the dental clinic said "I just need to have you answer a few questions," Fred came back with "And may I ask ''you'' one or two questions as well.") Lamont once remarked to Fred "You're just a dirty old man!"; Fred immediately replied, "And I'm gonna be one until I'm a ''dead'' old man."

Fred is also very untrusting of Lamont's friend Rollo ([[Nathaniel Taylor (actor)|Nathaniel Taylor]]) often referring to him as a [[convict]] because of his style. Fred has two best friends, [[Grady Wilson (Sanford and Son)|Grady Wilson]] ([[Whitman Mayo]]) and Bubba Bexley ([[Don Bexley]]). Even though Fred thinks the two are dim-witted, he knows that they are more than reliable and can always lend him a helping hand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3591">'''Harry Greenbank''' (11 September 1865 – 26 February 1899) was an English author and dramatist best known for contributing lyrics to the successful series musicals produced at [[Daly's Theatre]] by [[George Edwardes]] in the 1890s.

==Life and career==
Harry Greenbank was born Henry Harveston Greenbank in London, England and had an extraordinarily productive, but short, life.

Greenbank first placed one of his works, ''[[Captain Billy]]'', at the [[Savoy Theatre]], set to music by the company's musical director [[François Cellier]].  The piece was staged as a curtain-raiser to ''[[The Nautch Girl]]'' beginning in 1891.  He continued to write such small-scale pieces over the following couple of years, both for the Savoy (''[[Mr. Jericho]]'' in 1893 and ''[[Old Sarah]]'' in 1897) and for the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]], where Horace Sedger asked him to supply the English lyrics to [[F. C. Burnand]]'s adaptation of the French operetta ''Le Coeur et la main'' (Incognita).[[Image:Cover of the Vocal Score of Sidney Jones' The Geisha.jpg|thumb|Cover of the Vocal Score]]

After that, [[George Edwardes]] put Greenbank together as lyricist with music director [[Sidney Jones (composer)|Sidney Jones]] and dramatist [[Owen Hall]] to create the hit musical comedy ''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'' in 1893. After the worldwide success of that piece, the three stayed together and subsequently formed the backbone of the team which produced the famous series of very successful series of [[Daly's Theatre]] musicals, including ''[[An Artist's Model]]'' (1895), ''[[The Geisha]]'' (1896), ''[[A Greek Slave]]'' (1898), and ''[[San Toy]]'' (1899).

At the same time, Greenbank also provided lyrics for two of the most successful of the lighter shows produced by Edwardes at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] ''[[The Circus Girl]]'' (1896) and ''[[A Runaway Girl]]'' (1898).  He also ventured twice as librettist-lyricist, once with an original musical, ''Monte Carlo'', and once with an adaptation of Lecocq's ''La Petite Mademoiselle'' as ''The Scarlet Feather''.  He also contributed additional lyrics for ''The Bric à Brac Will'' (1895) and, posthumously, a song for the London production of ''[[A Chinese Honeymoon]]'' (1901), "Roses Red and White".

Greenbank was often in ill health, and during the production of ''A Greek Slave'', he moved with his wife and son to England's southern coast in an attempt to regain some strength.  He died there while writing lyrics for ''San Toy'', and the piece was completed by [[Adrian Ross]], who, with Greenbank, was largely responsible for establishing the post of lyricist (as opposed to librettist, or co-writer) in the modern musical theatre.

He died in [[Boscombe]], [[Bournemouth]], [[Hampshire]] at the age of 33.

'''Historical documents''' are original [[document]]s that contain important historical information about a person, place, or event and can thus serve as [[primary sources]] as important ingredients of the [[historical method]]ology.

Significant historical documents can be [[deed]]s, laws, accounts of battles (often given by the victors or persons sharing their viewpoint), or the exploits of the powerful. Though these documents are of historical interest, they do not detail the daily lives of ordinary people, or the way society functioned. [[Anthropologist]]s, [[historians]] and [[archeologists]] generally are more interested in documents that describe the [[everyday life|day-to-day lives]] of ordinary people, indicating what they ate, their interaction with other members of their households and social groups, and their states of mind. It is this [[information]] that allows them to try to understand and describe the way society was functioning at any particular time in [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prattlibrary.org/research/tools/index.aspx?cat=19963&amp;id=83744|title=Exploring Daily Life throughout History: How Did They Live?|publisher=[[Enoch Pratt Free Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek [[ostraka]] provide good examples of historical documents from "among the [[common people]]".

Many documents that are produced today, such as personal letters, pictures, contracts, newspapers, and medical records, would be considered valuable historical documents in the [[future]]. However most of these will be lost in the future since they are either printed on ordinary paper which has a limited lifespan, or even stored in [[Digital data|digital]] formats, then lost track over time.

Some companies and government entities are attempting to increase the number of documents that will survive the passage of time, by taking into account the preservation issues, and either printing documents in a manner that would increase the likelihood of them surviving indefinitely, or placing selected documents in [[time capsule]]s or other special [[information storage|storage]] environments.

[[File:Egypte louvre 021.jpg|right|thumbnail|250px|Egyptian scene depicting the preparation of Lily perfume]]

The word ''[[perfume]]''  is used today to describe scented mixtures and is derived from the Latin word, "''per fumus''," meaning ''through smoke''. The word [[Perfumery]] refers to the art of making perfumes. Perfume was further refined by the [[ancient Rome|Romans]], the [[Persian people|Persian]]s and the [[Arab]]s. Although perfume and perfumery also existed in East Asia, much of its fragrances were [[incense]] based. The basic ingredients and methods of making perfumes are described by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his [[Naturalis Historia]].

== Mesopotamia ==

The world's first recorded chemist is a woman named [[Tapputi]], a perfume maker whose existence was recorded on a 1200 BCE [[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablet]] in Babylonian [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Strathern, Paul |title=Mendeleyev's Dream&amp;nbsp;— The Quest For the Elements|location=New York | publisher=Berkley Books|year=2000|isbn=0-425-18467-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; She held a powerful role in the Mesopotamian government and religion, as the overseer of the Mesopotamian Royal Palace. She developed methods for scent extraction techniques that would lay the basis for perfume making. She recorded her techniques and methods and those were passed on, with her most groundbreaking technique in using solvents.&lt;ref&gt; Gabriele Kass-Simon, Patricia Farnes, Deborah Nash, eds. (1999). Women of science : righting the record (First Midland Book ed.). Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana Univ. Press. p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

== India ==

Perfume and perfumery also existed in [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus civilization]], which existed from 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE. One of the earliest distillation of [[Ittar]] was mentioned in the Hindu Ayurvedic text ''[[Charaka Samhita]]'' and ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Agriculture Diversification: Problems and Perspectives|author1=A.K. Sharma|author2= Seema Wahad|author3= Raśmī Śrīvāstava|page=140|publisher=I. K. International Pvt Ltd|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perfume references are part of a larger text called Brihat-Samhita written by [[Varāhamihira]], an Indian astronomer, mathematician, and astrologer living in the city of Ujjain. He was one of the ‘nine jewels’ in the court of the Maharaja of Malwa. The perfume portion mainly deals with the manufacture of perfumes to benefit ‘royal personages and inmates of harems’. The text is written as Sanskrit slokas with commentary by a 10th century Indian commentator Utpala.&lt;ref&gt;https://purplepaperplanes.wordpress.com/2013/08/30/perfume-from-ancient-indian-texts-brihat-samhita/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1975 report, archeologist Dr Paolo Rovesti found a terracotta distillation apparatus in the Indus valley together with oil containers made of the same material, carbon dated to 3000 BCE. The report also states that terracotta vessels with plugged orifices of woven materials were used so that when fragrant plant materials were covered with boiling water the vapours impregnated the material, which was subsequently wrung out to isolate the oil.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Cyprus ==

To date, the oldest perfumery was discovered on the island of [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael | last=Theodoulou | title=Archaeological dig sniffs out world's oldest perfumery | date=25 February 2005 | work =The Scotsman | url =http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=212432005&amp;format=print | accessdate = 19 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations in 2004-2005 under the initiative of an Italian archaeological team unearthed evidence of an enormous factory that existed 4,000 years ago during the [[Prehistory of Cyprus#Bronze Age|Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Tabitha | last=Morgan | title=Bronze Age perfume 'discovered' | date=19 March 2005 | publisher =[[BBC]]| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4364469.stm  | accessdate = 19 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This covered an estimated surface area of over 4,000m² indicating that perfume manufacturing was on an industrial scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Malcolm | last=Moore | title= Eau de BC: the oldest perfume in the world | date=21 March 2007 | work =[[The Daily Telegraph]]| url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/03/21/wperfume21.xml  | accessdate = 23 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The news of this discovery was reported extensively through the world press and many artifacts are already on display in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=John | last=Roach | title=Oldest Perfumes Found on "Aphrodite's Island" | date=29 March 2007 | work =National Geographic News | url =http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/03/070329-oldest-perfumes.html?source=rss | accessdate = 30 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Bible describes a sacred perfume (Exodus 30:22-33) consisting of liquid myrrh, fragrant cinnamon, fragrant cane, and cassia.  Its use was forbidden, except by the priests.
The women wore perfume to present their beauty.

== Islamic ==
{{see also|Alchemy and chemistry in Islam}}

[[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic cultures]] contributed significantly to the development of Western perfumery in two significant areas: perfecting the extraction of fragrances through steam distillation and introducing new raw materials. Both have greatly influenced Western perfumery and [[Science|scientific]] developments, particularly [[chemistry]].

With a rise of Islam, Muslims improved perfume production and continued to use perfumes in daily life and in practicing religion. They used musk, roses and amber, among other materials. As traders, Islamic cultures such as the Arabs and Persians had wider access to a wide array of spices, resins, herbs, precious woods, herbs and animal fragrance materials such as ambergris and musk. In addition to trading, many of the flowers and herbs used in perfumery were cultivated by the Muslims&amp;nbsp;— rose and jasmine were native to the region, and many other plants (i.e.: bitter orange and other citrus trees, all of which imported from China and southeast Asia) could be successfully cultivated in the Middle East, and are to this day key ingredients in perfumery.

In [[Islamic]] culture, perfume usage has been documented as far back as the 6th century and its usage is considered a religious duty. Muhammad said:

{{cquote|''The taking of a bath on Friday is compulsory for every male [[Muslim]] who has attained the age of puberty and (also) the cleaning of his teeth with [[Miswaak]] (type of twig used as a toothbrush), and the using of perfume if it is available.'' (Recorded in [[Sahih Bukhari]]).}}

They often used to blend extracts with the cement of which mosques were built.&lt;ref name="The History of Perfume"&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Perfume|url=http://www.everythinkaboutperfume.com/history.html|website=everythinkaboutperfume.com|accessdate=3 February 2015|language=en|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208043220/http://www.everythinkaboutperfume.com/history.html|archivedate=8 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such rituals gave incentives to scholars to search and develop a cheaper way to produce incenses and in mass production.

Many great discoveries originates from the region in 10th century, the time when the still was invented, and as a consequence of which the distill techniques considerably improved. Thanks to the hard work of two talented [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Arabian chemists]]: [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (Geber, born 722, Iraq), and [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus, born 801, Iraq) who established the perfume industry. Jabir developed many techniques, including distillation, evaporation and filtration, which enabled the collection of the odour of plants into a vapour that could be collected in the form of water or oil.&lt;ref name=Levey&gt;Levey, Martin (1973), "Early Arabic Pharmacology," ''E.J. Brill: Leiden'', {{ISBN|90-04-03796-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Kindi, however, was the real founder of perfume industry as he carried out extensive research and experiments in combining various plants and other sources to produce a variety of scent products. He elaborated a vast number of ‘recipes’ for a wide range of perfumes, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. His work in the laboratory is reported by a witness who said:

{{cquote|''I received the following description, or recipe, from Abu Yusuf Ya'qub b. Ishaq al-Kindi, and I saw him making it and giving it an addition in my presence''.}}

The writer goes on in the same section to speak of the preparation of a perfume called ''ghaliya'', which contained musk, amber and other ingredients; too long to quote here, but which reveals a long list of technical names of drugs and apparatus. Al-Kindi also wrote in the 9th century a book on perfumes which he named ‘''Book of the Chemistry of Perfume and Distillations''’. It contained more than a hundred recipes for fragrant oils, salves, aromatic waters and substitutes or imitations of costly drugs. The book also described one hundred and seven methods and recipes for perfume-making, and even the perfume making equipment, like the alembic, still bears its Arabic name.&lt;ref&gt;al-Hassani, Woodcok and Saoud (2006) 1001 Inventions; Muslim Heritage in Our World, FSTC, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Persian [[Islamic medicine|Muslim doctor]] and chemist [[Avicenna]] (also known as Ibn Sina) introduced the process of extracting oils from [[flowers]] by means of [[distillation]], the procedure most commonly used today. He first experimented with the rose. Until his discovery, liquid perfumes were mixtures of oil and crushed herbs, or petals which made a strong blend. Rose water was more delicate, and immediately became popular. Both of the raw ingredients and distillation technology significantly influenced western perfumery and [[Science|scientific]] developments, particularly [[chemistry]].

Eventually perfume arrived to European courts through [[Al-Andalus]] in the west, and on the other side, with the crusaders in the east. For instance, eggs and floral perfumes were brought to Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries from Arabia, by returning [[crusaders]], through trade with the Islamic world. Those who traded for these were most often also involved in trade for spices and dyestuffs. There are records of the Pepperers Guild of London, going back to 1179; which show them trading with Muslims in spices, perfume ingredients and dyes.&lt;ref name=Dunlop&gt;Dunlop, D.M. (1975), "Arab Civilization," ''Librairie du Liban''&lt;/ref&gt; Catharina de [[Medici]] initiated the perfume industry in Europe when she left Italy in the 16th century to marry the French crown prince.&lt;ref name="The History of Perfume"/&gt;

== Western ==

Knowledge of something perfumery came to [[Europe]] as early as the 14th century due partially to [[Arabic]] influences and knowledge. But it was the [[Hungarians]] who ultimately introduced the first modern perfume. The first modern perfume, made of scented oils blended in an alcohol solution, was made in 1370 at the command of [[Elisabeth of Poland|Queen Elizabeth of Hungary]] and was known throughout [[Europe]] as [[Hungary Water]]. The art of perfumery prospered in [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]], and in the 16th century, Italian refinements were taken to France by [[Catherine de' Medici]]'s personal perfumer, [[Rene le Florentin]]. His laboratory was connected with her apartments by a secret passageway, so that no formulas could be stolen en route.

===France===
[[France]] quickly became the European center of perfume and cosmetic manufacture.  Cultivation of flowers for their perfume essence, which had begun in the 14th century, grew into a major industry in the south of France mainly in [[Grasse]] now considered the world capital of perfume. During the [[Renaissance]] period, perfumes were used primarily by royalty and the wealthy to mask body odors resulting from the sanitary practices of the day. Partly due to this patronage, the western perfumery industry was created.
Perfume enjoyed huge success during the 17th century. [[Perfumed glove]]s became popular in France and in 1656, the guild of glove and perfume-makers was established. Perfumers were also known to create poisons; for instance, a French duchess was murdered when a perfume/poison was rubbed into her gloves and was slowly absorbed into her skin.

Perfume came into its own when [[Louis XV]] came to the throne in the 18th century. His court was called "la cour parfumée" (the perfumed court). [[Madame de Pompadour]] ordered generous supplies of perfume, and King Louis demanded a different fragrance for his apartment every day. The court of Louis XIV was even named due to the scents which were applied daily not only to the skin but also to clothing, fans and furniture. Perfume substituted for soap and water. The use of perfume in France grew steadily. By the 18th century, aromatic plants were being grown in the [[Grasse]] region of France to provide the growing perfume industry with raw materials. Even today, France remains the centre of the European perfume design and [[trade]].

After [[Napoleon]] came to power, exorbitant expenditures for perfume continued. Two quarts of violet cologne were delivered to him each week, and he is said to have used sixty bottles of double extract of [[jasmine]] every month. Josephine had stronger perfume preferences. She was partial to musk, and she used so much that sixty years after her death the scent still lingered in her boudoir.

=== England ===

Perfume use peaked in England during the reigns of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] (reigned 1509-1547) and Queen Elizabeth I (reigned 1558-1603). All public places were scented{{by whom|date=July 2015}} during Queen Elizabeth's rule, since she could not tolerate bad smells.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} It was said that the sharpness of her nose was equaled only by the slyness of her tongue. Ladies of the day took great pride in creating delightful fragrances and they displayed their skill in mixing scents.

As with industry and the arts, perfume underwent profound change in the 19th century. Changing tastes and the development of modern chemistry laid the foundations of modern perfumery as alchemy gave way to chemistry.

=== Russia ===

Perfume manufacture in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] grew after 1861 and became globally significant by the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;

In early America, the first scents were colognes and scented water by French explorers in New France. Florida water, an uncomplicated mixture of eau de cologne with a dash of oil of cloves, cassia and lemongrass, was popular.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

A '''hookah lounge''' (also called a '''shisha bar''' or '''den''', especially in Britain and parts of Canada, or a '''hookah bar''') is an establishment where patrons share [[Mu‘assel|shisha]]  from a communal [[hookah]] or from one which is placed at each table or a bar. [[File:HarvardSquareHookah.jpg|222px|thumb|Center|A [[hookah]] and a variety of [[tobacco]] products are on display in a [[Harvard Square]] [[window shopping|store window]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], [[United States]].]]
Often, hookah lounges are owned and operated by people from the [[Arab world]],  origin and or other regions where use of the hookah is a centuries-old tradition. Many hookah lounges incorporate such elements as [[Islamic architecture|Islamic decor]] and [[Arabic music]] or [[Music of India|Indian music]]. In Europe this is no longer a fact and hookah lounges are simply a bar without the eastern cultural elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/05/20/EBGAJCNHUM1.DTL&amp;type=t|title=East Bay: Aromas, relaxation are the hook in hookah|date=20 May 2005|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Hookah lounges are mostly found in [[college town]]s and [[urban area]]s and are regarded by some as a novel and chic way to socialize and embrace [[multiculturalism]]. Certain lounges offer modern hookahs with fruit bowls or other kinds of improvements over smoking hookah at home.&lt;ref name="redorbit.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192828/http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/344847/hookah_bars_finding_a_place_in_america/index.html?source=r_health|title=Hookah Bars Finding a Place in America - Health - RedOrbit|date=27 September 2007|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some people of [[Middle East]]ern or [[South Asia]]n extraction consider them a continuation of their own cultural traditions. Hookah lounges nowadays often distance themselves from the eastern cultures offering hookah and alcohol without the cultural elements. These bars differ from other bars only in the fact that they offer hookah. {{CN|date=June 2015}}

Typically a disposable mouthpiece is provided for each user for [[hygiene]] reasons.  Hookah lounges do not typically have [[liquor license]]s but instead derive the bulk of their revenue from sales of [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[soft drink]]s and [[snack food]]s.{{cn|date=August 2014}}  Almost all offer [[Turkish coffee]]. 

Some hookah lounges have well-equipped kitchens and are more akin to [[bistro]]s.  In the broadest sense, any [[restaurant]] or [[nightclub]] can be considered a hookah lounge if it offers patrons hookahs, shisha and a comfortable place to smoke. Some offer [[Middle Eastern cuisine]] menu items.

Due to several state anti-tobacco laws, many hookah bars have made the transition from smoking traditional shisha to smoking herbal shisha because it contains no tobacco, or nicotine and is legal indoors in areas specific to the prohibition of tobacco smoking. Herbs do produce tar when they burn.

[[Image:AleppoCafeWaterpipe.jpg|thumb|222px|Waterpipes outside a café in [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]].]]

==History==

The hookah in its first and simplest form originated in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://article-niche.com/launch/25-08-2008History-Of-Hookah.htm|title=article-niche.com|website=article-niche.com|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It soon traveled west to [[Iran]], [[Turkey]], and [[Egypt]], where it gained mass popularity{{CN|date=June 2015}} The hookah lounge has clear antecedents in the tradition of [[coffee house]]s in the Middle East and Turkey, where people smoke tobacco from hookahs or other styles of [[Bong|water pipe]] provided by the establishment.  In this traditional setting the hookah is typically of the single-hose variety.  This is in contrast with the multi-hose variety favored in the hookah lounge and intended to emphasize the communal nature of the activity.

==In Europe==
*'''[[Germany]]''' - Hookahs are available in many establishments in Germany, particularly in [[Berlin]], [[Cologne]] and the [[Ruhr Area]] and areas, and it is not only popular amongst [[Turkish people]].
*'''[[Netherlands]]''' - Hookahs are now gaining popularity in the Netherlands, particularly in [[Rotterdam]] and [[Amsterdam]].
*'''[[United Kingdom]]''' - In the United Kingdom, hookahs are most commonly found in "shisha bars" run by [[Lebanon|Lebanese]], [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] or [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] people. Since a 2007 British ban on smoking in public places, Shisha bars have risen from 179 in 2007 to 556 in 2012. Birmingham also has a large number of Shisha lounges also such as Shabbi Shics in the Digbeth area of town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hubble, bubble |url=https://www.economist.com/britain/2013/08/24/hubble-bubble |accessdate=4 October 2018 |work=The Economist |date=24 August 2013 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Spain]]''' - Hookah use has grown in popularity in Spain, especially among the young.  As a result, many ''teterías'' ([[tea house]]s) have made hookahs available to patrons.
* '''[[Russia]]''' - Due to heavy influence from Caucasus and Central Asia, hookahs have become a widespread recreational practice in large Russian cities, and are now offered in many cafes and restaurants.
* '''[[Denmark]]''' - Hookah lounges have gained heavy popularity in the recent years. You can most likely find a hookah lounge in every moderately big city. [[Aarhus]], [[Odense]] and [[Copenhagen]] being the biggest citites in Denmark, you can without a doubt find several hookah lounges in each of these cities.

==In the United States==
[[Image:Hookah Lounge.jpg|thumb|Mist Hookah Lounge in North Brunswick, New Jersey]]
In the [[United States]], establishments akin to hookah lounges first opened decades ago in the [[immigrant]] quarters of [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles, California]] as coffee and tea houses. The Hookah was not the central focus of the businesses until the Hookah Lounge in Las Vegas featured it as the primary offering. Patrons were typically men of Middle Eastern descent{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} The first establishment to call itself the Hookah Lounge, is in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Hookah Lounge created the entire experience of the Hookah, specialty cocktails and Middle Eastern food. The decor is Moroccan. They registered the name in 2000 and began using the URL Hookahlounge.com. They have two locations in Las Vegas. It was the first full service bar that focused its business around serving hookahs. The Hookah Lounge in Las Vegas was opened in 2000 by owner Paymon Raouf and operator Jeff Ecker. The Hookah Lounge in Las Vegas originally defended the use of the name Hookah Lounge but it became too commonly used and too costly to defend. They now use the term America's Original Hookah Lounge in advertisements to better identify them as the first to operate in a major lounge setting. 

Many hookah lounges in the United States have [[modernism|modernistic]] elements such as glass tables, [[plasma television]]s, and [[oxygen bar]]s. Most bars in the U.S. require patrons to be at least 18 years of age to smoke shisha and 18 years of age to purchase (exceptions are Utah, Arizona, Alabama, and New Jersey: 19 years of age to smoke; New York is 21 years of age). &lt;ref name="redorbit.com"/&gt;

One purveyor of hookahs and shisha claims:

{{quote|It's at its largest demand ever in this country...I don't think it's going away anytime soon. There's so much more room for the product to expand. Only a small percentage of Americans know about it.&lt;ref name="redorbit.com"/&gt;}}

Over the recent years hookah in general has become increasingly popular for the young-adults; those who are just at the legal age to smoke in their state. It is not uncommon now to find hookah bars within short distance of college campuses and in the surrounding towns. This younger generation has revitalized the hookah market, hookah bars are successful and remaining open despite indoor smoking bans{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} For private hookah smokers, many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean markets now offer hookah products for sale.

==Smoking bans and exemptions==
Hookah use has increased dramatically among American and European youth in recent years because of the social atmosphere it creates, and because many young adults know it as an alternative to cigarette smoking.

Many municipalities, especially in North America and Europe have enacted [[smoking ban]]s in public places. Sometimes, however, businesses can obtain special permits allowing smoking within; these permits are typically available only for hookah lounges, [[cigar bar]]s, [[tobacconist]]s, and similar establishments where smoking is the focus of activity. They are less frequently available for places in which alcohol or food is served.

In some cases, the ban is against tobacco smoking specifically. When this is the case, a hookah lounge may remain in business by replacing traditional, tobacco-based shisha with a tobacco-free Mu‘assel.

In order to remain open, many hookah lounges cannot sell food or beverages. Approximately 90% of the cities that have put a ban on smoking in public places have exemptions for hookah lounges. The cities with these kinds of exemptions, typically, have more dense populations.&lt;ref name="PublicBan"&gt;A, Primack B. "US Health Policy Related to Hookah Tobacco Smoking." National Center for Biotechnology Information. U.S. National Library of Medicine, 24 July 2012. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public health concerns===
Because hookah lounges are exempt from the smoking bans, and because the hookah trend is increasing at a high rate among youth, many believe it is becoming a public health concern. Many hookah users do not understand the health risks that come along with it. Common beliefs include shisha is not addictive, and the smoke contains less [[carcinogens]].
Hookah smoke contains the same chemicals found in cigarettes, it is not safer because it is smoked as often, it is addictive, and even if the tobacco is filtered with water, the carcinogens are not filtered out.&lt;ref name="HealthEffects"&gt;Morris, Daniel S., Steven C. Fiala, and Rebecca Pawlak. "Opportunities for Policy Interventions to Reduce Youth Hookah Smoking in the United States." Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. N.p., 15 Nov. 2012. Web. 01 Apr. 2013..&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Popularity"&gt;Channick, Robert. "Hookah Lounges Thriving, Three Years after Smoking Ban." Chicago Tribune. N.p. Web.13 Apr. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, many cities want to create tougher restrictions for hookah lounges, and some want them shut down altogether.

''Also see [[Conch (instrument)]]''
{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
[[File:Antique Japanese horagi (conch shell trumpet).JPG|300px|thumb|right|Japanese horagai. A conch shell used for religious purposes or as a [[signal instrument|signal]] for [[samurai]]]]
'''''{{nihongo|Horagai|[[wiktionary:法|法]][[wiktionary:螺|螺]][[wiktionary:貝|貝]]|}}''''' (or '''''{{nihongo|jinkai|[[wiktionary:陣|陣]][[wiktionary:貝|貝]]|}}''''' ) are large [[conch shell]]s, usually from ''[[Charonia tritonis]]'', that have been used as [[trumpet]]s in Japan for many centuries. The instrument, which has served a number of purposes throughout [[Japanese history]], has been given a number of Japanese names depending on its function. Special schools still teach students to play the traditional music associated with the conch.

==Instrument==
Unlike most shell trumpets from other parts of the world which produce only one pitch, the Japanese ''hora'' or ''horagai'' can produce three or five different notes. The different pitches are achieved using a bronze or wooden mouthpiece attached to the apex of the shell's spire. At freezing temperatures (often encountered in the mountainous regions of Japan) the lips may freeze to the metal surface, so wooden or bamboo mouthpieces are used.

==Historical usage==

===Religion===
The conch is used by [[Japanese Buddhism|Buddhist]] monks for religious purposes. Its use goes back at least{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} 1,000 years, and it is still used today for some rituals, such as the ''[[omizutori]]'' (water drawing) portion of the [[Shuni-e]] rites at the [[Tōdai-ji]] in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. Each Shugendō school has his own conch shell melodies.

The ''hora'' is especially associated with the ''[[Yamabushi]]'', [[ascetic]] warrior monks of the [[Shugendō]] tradition. The ''[[yamabushi]]'' used the trumpet to signal their presence (or movements) to one another across mountains and to accompany the chanting of [[sutra]]s.

===Military===
In war, the shell, called ''jinkai'', or "war shell", was one of several [[Commons:Category:Samurai signal devices|signal devices]] used by Japanese feudal warriors known as [[samurai]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8n9A-jWUhHMC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=samurai+horagai&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IwoQTqToJYKftweDz7DXDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=samurai%20horagai&amp;f=true ''Warriors of Medieval Japan'', Stephen Turnbull, Osprey Publishing, 2007 P.106]&lt;/ref&gt; A large conch would be used and fitted with a bronze (or wooden) mouthpiece. It would be held in an [[openwork]] basket and blown with a different combination of "notes" to signal troops to attack, withdraw, or change strategies, in the same way a bugle or [[flugelhorn]] was used in the west. The trumpeter was called a ''kai yaku'' ([[wiktionary:貝|貝]][[wiktionary:役|役]]).

The ''jinkai'' served a similar function to [[taiko|drums]] and bells in signaling troop formations, setting a rhythm for marching, providing something of a heroic accompaniment to encourage the troops and confusing the enemy by inferring that the troop numbers were large enough to require such trumpeters. Many ''[[daimyō]]s'' (feudal lords) enlisted ''yamabushi'' to serve as ''kai yaku'', due to their experience with the instrument.

The sound of ''jinkai'' is often used in motion pictures and television dramas as a symbolic sound effect indicating an impending battle, e.g., ''[[The Last Samurai]]'' or the 2007 [[Taiga drama]] ''[[Fūrinkazan]]'', but both of these screen renditions use deep, resonating monotones, not the melodic tones that ''yamabushi'' used for relaying messages.

The '''Kentucky Theater''' was a [[theater]] and [[performing arts]] center at 651 S. 4th St., located in the theater district of [[downtown Louisville|downtown]] [[Louisville, Kentucky]] in the [[United States of America]].

Built in 1921, the building served for sixty years as a [[Film|movie]] house.  The movie house closed in 1986, and was almost scheduled for demolition until a local entrepreneur bought it at auction and  turned it over to two arts advocates who created a non-profit arts organization, called the Kentucky Theater Project, Inc.  The newly renovated Kentucky Theater opened its doors in 2000 and is now a vibrant community arts center and art film house. In 2008, the Kentucky Theater was renovated into the Kentucky Theater Shops. It now includes a gourmet food shop, a wine and spirits shop, a bagel shop and a florist shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatersquaremarketplace.com/ |title=Theater Square Marketplace |publisher=Theater Square Marketplace |date= |accessdate=2011-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of nontraditional bagpipe usage'''. The [[Bagpipes|bagpipe]] is a musical instrument using enclosed [[reed (music)|reeds]] fed from a constant reservoir of air in the form of a bag. Though the Scottish [[Great Highland Bagpipe]] and Irish [[uilleann pipes]] have the greatest international visibility, bagpipes have been for centuries played throughout large parts of [[Europe]], the [[Caucasus]], around the [[Persian Gulf]] and in [[Northern Africa]]. In recent years, often driven by revivals of native folk music and dance, many types of bagpipes have enjoyed a resurgence in popularity and, in many cases, instruments that were on the brink of obscurity have become extremely popular. This list details the use of bagpipes in a variety of works, from classical to jazz and rock.

==In contemporary classical music==
*''Sinfonia Concertante for Six Solo Instruments and Orchestra'', S. 98.6, by [[P. D. Q. Bach]] features bagpipes as one of the six instruments.
*''The Brendan Voyage'' (1983), ''The Pilgrim'' (1983) and ''Granuaile'' (1985), all by [[Shaun Davey]], are orchestral works featuring the [[uilleann pipes]].
*''The Relief of Derry Symphony'' (1990), also by [[Shaun Davey]], includes a highland pipe band.
*''[[An Orkney Wedding, with Sunrise]]'' (1984) by Sir [[Peter Maxwell Davies]]
*''Cross Lane Fair'' for [[Northumbrian smallpipes|Northumbrian pipes]] and Orchestra by Sir [[Peter Maxwell Davies]]
*''Arthur's Return'', for bagpipes and string orchestra (1983) by [[John Davison (composer)|John Davison]] (Commissioned by the Concerto Soloists of Philadelphia and premiered in Dover, Delaware on September 23, 1983, by the Concerto Soloists of Philadelphia, dir. Marc Mostovoy; Roderick MacDonald, bagpipe)
*''Joan of Arc: An Opera in daquan Acts'' (1993) by Steven Jobe includes bagpipes in the orchestra.
*''Sinfonia mit Dudelsack und Drehleier "Die Bauernhochzeit" (Sinfonia with Bagpipe and Hurdy-Gurdy "Peasant Wedding")'' by [[Leopold Mozart]], first performed in 1756
*''Ur Og and Aji'',&lt;!--Need year composed--&gt; for 4 bagpipes, bass clarinet, and tabla by Canadian composer Michael O'Neill.

Some writers have had prolific careers with hundreds of their works being published.  While some [[list of best-selling fiction authors|best-selling author]]s have written a small number of books that have sold millions of copies, others have had lengthy careers and maintained a high level of output year after year. [[Dame Agatha Christie]], the most-published novelist in history, is estimated to have sold 4 billion books, having written 69 novels and 19 plays.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Michael. [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117776459?refCatId=3 Agatha Christie gets a clue for filmmakers]. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. 14 February 2000. Accessed 23 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Her works were published between 1920 and 1976, equating to around three publications every two years. [[Dame Barbara Cartland]] has also sold millions of copies of her books but wrote many more than Christie.  She spent 80 years as a novelist with 722 books published, averaging one book released every 40 days of her career.&lt;ref name="Womack"&gt;Womack, Philip. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/8080503/Being-a-prolific-author-isnt-a-bad-thing.html Being a prolific author isn't a bad thing]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''. 25 October 2010. Accessed 22 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; While Cartland wrote a significant number of full-length novels, other authors have been published many more times but have specialised in short stories. Spanish author Corín Tellado wrote over 4,000 novellas, selling 400 million copies of her books.&lt;ref name="Tellado"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6114908.ece |title=Corín Tellado: Spanish romantic writer |work=The Sunday Times |date=18 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524074821/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6114908.ece |archive-date=24 May 2010 |access-date=20 January 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all authors work alone. Groups of writers, sometimes led by one central figure, have published under shared pseudonyms.  The [[Stratemeyer Syndicate]], started by [[Edward Stratemeyer]] in 1905, created [[List of Stratemeyer Syndicate series|numerous book series]] including 190 volumes of ''[[The Hardy Boys]]'' and 175 volumes of ''[[Nancy Drew]]''.  More than 1,300 books were published by the group, and although Edward L. Stratemeyer wrote several hundred, he also employed [[ghostwriter]]s to keep up with the demand.  These writers were given storylines and strict guidelines to follow to ensure a level of consistency within each series.  Amongst the writing team was [[Howard R. Garis]], who contributed several hundred books to the collection, one of the most active authors.  Sales were estimated at over two hundred million copies before the syndicate was sold to [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Woodmansee, Martha. Osteen, Mark. ''The new economic criticism: studies at the intersection of literature and economics''. Routledge. 1999. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most authors carefully craft their work, writing and rewriting several times before publication.  Some authors simply use pen and paper, while others such as [[Isaac Asimov]] spent hours at a stretch working at a [[typewriter]].&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Lewis.

The '''''Magic:  The Gathering'' Pro Tour Hall of Fame''' was started in 2005 to honor the most successful ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' [[Pro Tour (Magic: The Gathering)|Pro Tour]] players. The first inductions came on the tenth anniversary of the first Pro Tour event, and new Hall of Famers will be determined annually. Players who are eligible for the ballot (as below) can be voted in the Hall of Fame if they get more than 60% of the election committee's votes. As of 2018, there are 48 players from 12 different countries in the Hall of Fame.

{{TOC right}}

==Eligibility==
In order to appear on the [[Hall of Fame]] selection ballot, a player must meet the following five requirements (Or the first four requirement if they never appeared in any previous ballots):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pro Tour Hall of Fame Updates Plus RPTQ Decks | publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]] | date = 8 June 2017 | accessdate = 24 June 2017 | url = http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/organized-play/pro-tour-hall-fame-updates-plus-rptq-decks-2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hall of Fame Rules | publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]] | date = 16 June 2013 | accessdate = 4 August 2013 | url = http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/HallOfFame.aspx?x=mtgevent/hof/rules}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The player must have participated in his or her first ''Magic: the Gathering'' Pro Tour at least 10 seasons prior to the current voting year.
# The player must have at least 150 lifetime Pro Tour Points. (Prior to 2013, the threshold was 100 lifetime Pro Tour Points.)
# The player must have at least 2 single-elimination round finishes in Pro Tours. (From 2017 onwards)
# The player must not currently be suspended from playing ''Magic'' or be under investigation by the [[The DCI|DCI]] (Previous suspension does not disqualify a player from entering the Hall of Fame.)
# The player must not currently be removed from ballot by the voting committee. If they are currently removed by the ballot, they must finish with at least 4 Pro Points in period between the previous and current voting.

(* Pro Tour includes all [[Magic: The Gathering World Championship|''Magic: The Gathering'' World Championship]] before year 2011)

==Voting process==
The Selection Committee votes on who to induct into the Hall of Fame. The committee includes [[Wizards of the Coast]] employees, [[The DCI|DCI]] members, judges, long-time reporters, developers, all Hall of Famers, and every ''Magic'' player with at least 150 Pro Points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Selection Committee | year = 2016 | accessdate = 17 July 2016 | publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]] | url = http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/top-players/pthof/2016/selection-committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every member of the Selection Committee gets to vote for up to five of the eligible players. Afterwards every player with at least 60% of the votes gets inducted into the Hall of Fame. If nobody gets 60% of the vote, the player with the most votes will be inducted into the Hall of Fame.

If a player received 10% or less of the votes in 3 consecutive votings, they will be removed from the Hall of Fame ballot. They will be eligible again if they score 4 Pro Tour Points during a specific period (roughly the same period between two consecutive votings).

===Historical selection process===
The selection procedure was changed several times. In 2005 the Selection Committee voted for five players, and the four players receiving the most votes were inducted. Then a Players' Committee voted for one player that was not already selected, and the player receiving the most votes was also inducted.

From 2006 members of the Selection Committee and the Players' Committee received the list of players eligible for induction. Each member selected five players for induction. The votes were tabulated by a weighted percentage:  Selection Committee votes counted 2/3, and Players' Committee votes counted 1/3. In 2006 and 2007 the five players with the highest percentages were inducted into the Hall of Fame. Between 2008 and 2016 only the players with over 40% of the weighted votes were inducted or if no one mets this criterion the player with the highest percentage was inducted.

==Benefits==
The Hall of Fame inductees will receive a number of benefits for the rest of his or her life (unless suspended by the DCI). As of 2016–17 season, it includes the benefits below:
#A guaranteed entry to any Pro Tour event and [[Magic: The Gathering World Championship#World Magic Cup|World Magic Cup]] Qualifiers
#Appearance fee at the Pro Tour featuring the yearly Hall of Fame induction.
#Bye(s) in Grand Prix and World Magic Cup Qualifiers.
#Additional [[Magic: The Gathering Online|''Magic Online'']] Championship Series seasonal QPs.
If a Hall of Fame player is a current Platinum level member of the Pro Players Club, the higher reward will apply to them (i.e. they receive two instead of one bye in World Magic Cup Qualifiers, 20QP instead of 15QP in the ''Magic Online'' Championship Series).

Players who enter the Hall of Fame since will also receive a special commemorative ring at the induction ceremony.

==Controversies==

===Tomoharu Saito banning===
In the ballot of 2010, [[Tomoharu Saito]] was voted into the Hall of Fame with a weighted percentage of 47.74%.&lt;ref name="Ballots2010"/&gt; However, two weeks prior to the induction Saito was disqualified during Grand Prix Florence leading to an 18-month suspension from the game. The rules do not allow currently-suspended players to be voted into the Hall of Fame. Wizards announced without further explanation that Saito would not be part of the Hall of Fame based on the 2010 ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Saito removed from Hall of Fame selection | publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]] | date = 8 December 2010 | accessdate = 8 December 2010 | url = http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/news/120810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bram Snepvangers miscalculation===
In the original ballot results for 2010, Bram Snepvangers received a weighted percentage of 39.95%, barely missing the required 40%. However, in the days following the publication of results it was discovered that there had been an error in the calculations. Weights of 0.667 and 0.333 had been used for the votes from the Selection Committee and Players Committee respectively while the rules clearly stated that 0.67 and 0.33 were the correct numbers. After recalculating the scores Snepvangers landed at 40.03% and was inducted into the Hall of Fame along with Nassif and Kibler.&lt;ref name="Snepvangers"/&gt;

The '''Minnesota Fringe Festival''' is a performing arts festival held in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], [[United States]], every summer, usually during the first two weeks in August.  The eleven-day event, which features performing artists of many genres and disciplines, is one of many [[Fringe Festival]]s in [[North America]].  Minnesota Fringe is the largest nonjuried festival in the United States&lt;ref name=2014stribstats&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Fringe Festival hits new ticket record|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/blogs/270773461.html|accessdate=November 24, 2014|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the third-largest Fringe festival in North America.  In 2013, Minnesota Fringe ran August 1–11 and featured 176 shows with a total of 895 performances in multiple venues around the city and distributed 50,007 tickets over the eleven-day event. In 2007, attendance and box office revenue were adversely affected by the [[I-35W Mississippi River bridge|collapse of the I-35W bridge]] the day before the festival opened.

Fringe shows are 60 minutes or less and appear in an official venue supplied by the festival for five performances stretched out over the festival's eleven days.  Venues vary widely, with capacities ranging from 55 to over 400, and available configurations include black-box, proscenium, thrust or arena stages.  Past venues include Minneapolis Theatre Garage, [[HUGE Improv Theater]], [[Mixed Blood Theatre]] mainstage, [[Theatre de la Jeune Lune]]'s side stage and the four stages at the [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[Rarig Center]].&lt;ref name=2014venues&gt;{{cite news|title=Minnesota Fringe will have 20 Minneapolis venues|url=http://www.twincities.com/stage/ci_25426766/minnesota-fringe-will-have-20-minneapolis-venues|accessdate=November 24, 2014|work=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]|date=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, eleven shows will share a venue.

Performing companies that participate in the Fringe split a share of the ticket revenues with the festival and pay an application fee.  Currently, the artists' share is 65 percent of the box office revenue.

The 2017 festival, which runs August 3-13, marks the 24th annual festival, the first under the leadership of executive director Dawn Bentley, who assumed this position on April 3, 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Rohan|title=A new director takes the helm at the Minnesota Fringe Festival|url=http://www.startribune.com/a-new-director-takes-the-helm-at-the-minnesota-fringe-festival/415000824/|accessdate=March 1, 2017|publisher=[[Star Tribune|Minneapolis Star Tribune]]|date=February 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; after former executive director Jeff D.

==History==
{{further|List of Minnesota Fringe Festivals}}
The Minnesota Fringe Festival was created as part of a trend of [[fringe festival]] establishments in the United States. The country's first fringe was the [[Seattle Fringe Festival]], founded in 1991, followed by the [[Orlando International Fringe Theater Festival]] and the [[San Francisco Fringe Festival]] in 1992 and 1993, respectively.&lt;ref name="NA fests"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hersh|first1=Amy|title=North American fringe fests: A new tradition that's growing|url=https://apps.hclib.org/auth/EDS?url=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ebscohost.com%2flogin.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26db%3dedb%26AN%3d9512033983%26site%3deds-live%26scope%3dsite|accessdate=June 14, 2016|work=[[Backstage (magazine)|Back Stage]]|date=November 17, 1995|subscription=yes|via=[[EBSCOHost]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by Bob McFadden and operating with a budget of around $35,000, the Minnesota Fringe Festival first ran from June 23–July 2, 1994, in several theaters around the [[Cedar-Riverside, Minneapolis|West Bank]] neighborhood of [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref name="fringe at 20"&gt;{{cite news|title=Minnesota Fringe Festival at 20|first1=Rohan|last1=Preston|url=http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-fringe-festival-at-20/217176491/|date=August 1, 2013|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|archivedate=July 9, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709230904/http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-fringe-festival-at-20/217176491/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pizzato"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pizzato|first1=Mark|title=Minnesota Fringe Festival|journal=[[Theatre Journal]]|date=March 1995|volume=47|issue=1|pages=142–145|jstor=3208817|doi=10.2307/3208817}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the festival's name, the Minnesota Fringe did not serve as the fringe festival to any larger, more mainstream theater event. The first annual Fringe was described by Mark Pizzato as "quickly organized and underpublicized", with low attendance reported at its 53 shows, each of which cost six dollars or less and ran under 90 minutes.&lt;ref name="pizzato" /&gt; It drew 4,600 theatergoers and featured shows from companies hailing from three continents (North America, Asia, and Europe).&lt;ref name="returns1995"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abdallah|first1=Cheryl|title=Minnesota Fringe Festival Returns|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-2351423.html|accessdate=June 14, 2016|work=Asian Pages|date=June 30, 1995|subscription=yes|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival's growth was modest in its first several years. In 1997, following the previous year's festival which had seen the lowest attendance of any Fringe to date, the event moved to the [[Loring Park]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name="loring"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vaughan|first1=Peter|title=Grass is greener in Loring Park for Fringe|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62606945.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=March 16, 1997|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year marked an attendance of 4,300, after which point Dean Seal replaced McFadden as the festival's executive director.&lt;ref name="seal steps down"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Fringe producer Seal steps down; festival reorganizes staff|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-78377664.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=September 18, 2001|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="passes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Rohan|title=Fringe getting bigger|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62564942.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=August 23, 1998|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the festival began offering patrons multi-show passes and attendance increased to 6,573.&lt;ref name="passes" /&gt; The following year, the festival's attendance more than doubled, owing, according to Fringe officials, to better marketing and the 68 shows at that years festival, an increase from previous years.&lt;ref name="double"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Rohan|title=Fans flocked to this year's Fringe Festival|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62458919.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=August 12, 1999|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Fringe won a $10,000 grant from the [[McKnight Foundation]] and once more expanded, to 80 shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Rohan|title=Boosting the Fringe|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62456545.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=April 23, 2000|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Festival operations, with a working budget of $260,000, were run out of an office space above the Acadia Cabaret Cafe in Minneapolis, and the festival had begun attracting a variety of sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peck|first1=Claude|title=Growth at the Fringe|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-63677082.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=July 23, 2000|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in its earlier years, acts had been selected by invitation, by the new millennium the festival was operating on an [[unjuried]] [[first-come, first-served]] model.&lt;ref name="loring" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2001 success"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Success presses Fringe|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-76875872.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=July 29, 2001|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 festival marked the first year that Fringe organizers had to turn away applicants, with the number of shows capped at 120.&lt;ref name="2001 success" /&gt; The festival had also expanded into screening films and showcasing visual art as part of the Visual Fringe.&lt;ref name="on the move"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Fringe is on the move|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-88131007.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=June 30, 2002|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seal, the only full-time Fringe employee, resigned as the festival's executive director in 2001 and was replaced by Leah Cooper, who had for the previous three years served as president of the organization's board.&lt;ref name="on the move" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new fringe boss"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=New Fringe boss|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-81123285.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=December 16, 2001|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in her tenure, Cooper hired a full-time volunteer coordinator, a director for Visual Fringe, and a part-time office manager. The 2002 festival was the first in a number of years to employ venues outside of Loring Park, expanding the festival's footprint to the [[Uptown, Minneapolis|Uptown]] district. By this point, the Minnesota Fringe was the United States's largest fringe festival.&lt;ref name="on the move" /&gt; In the following years, the festival's most popular shows saw increased attendance, including record numbers of sold-out houses, as well as reprises and remounts at other venues, while mean attendance decreased, indicating decreased attendance at smaller shows.&lt;ref name="fifteen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Fringe Festival attendance rose 15.3%|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-120860970.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=August 18, 2004|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flowering"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Flowering Fringe|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-120279765.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=August 6, 2004|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper in 2004 announced plans to exit the Fringe after the 2005 festival, but stayed on an additional year to help solve fundraising issues that arose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Leah Cooper to quit Fringe Festival|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-122114236.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=September 16, 2004|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Fringe fest director says she is leaving|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-146700256.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=June 6, 2006|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the festival began using venues in the West Bank neighborhood again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Fringe fest adds U's Rarig Center to its stages|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-143738607.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=March 26, 2006|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features of the Minnesota Fringe==
[[File:The Donner Party Kidz!.jpg|thumb|right|''The Donner Party Kidz!'', a show from the 2012 Festival]]
===Nonjuried entry===
Minnesota Fringe Festival is nonjuried; that is, the performers and shows are not vetted by a panel of judges ahead of time.  Companies that wish to perform submit applications and are drawn by lottery, a practice that replaced the festival's former method of "first come, first served" in 2004.

===Performance categories===
The festival is open to all performing artists.  Show genres typically include comedy (scripted and improv), drama, dance (classical, modern and ethnic), puppetry, musical theater, opera and shows for/by children and teens. Minnesota Fringe, like many fringe festivals, has proven to be an excellent launching point for new work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2amtheatre.com/2010/08/19/the-minnesota-fringe-festival-and-the-popularity-of-new-plays/ "The Minnesota Fringe Festival and the Popularity of New Plays"]; 2AMt blog, Max "Bunny" Sparber; 19 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accessibility===
Each venue is wheelchair-accessible and the festival offers ASL-interpreted shows for the deaf and hard-of-hearing, as well as audio-described shows for the blind.&lt;ref name=access&gt;{{cite news|title=Accessible Fringe Festival Returns for 13th Season|url=http://www.accesspress.org/archive/2006/07/story_accessible_fringe_festival.htm|accessdate=November 24, 2014|work=Access Press|date=July 10, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014133421/http://www.accesspress.org/archive/2006/07/story_accessible_fringe_festival.htm|archivedate=October 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Bring Your Own Venue"===
In the past, Minnesota Fringe has provided an option for companies to produce site-specific work outside the official venues. The Bring Your Own Venue (BYOV) option was only available for shows that could not normally fit into a traditional theater space.  Past BYOV shows have been staged in places such as a clothing store dressing area, a swimming pool, an art gallery and a coffee shop.  In 2006, 23 shows, a record number, performed in BYOV slots.&lt;ref&gt;Papatola, Dominic; [http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/entertainment/performing_arts/15181139.htm "Wrinkle in the rules requires some fringers to get a place lift"]; St. Paul Pioneer Press; 3 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Website===
The [http://www.fringefestival.org Minnesota Fringe Festival Website] operates year-round.  All of the shows in the yearly festival are up for review by any audience member who registers on the site.  Shows are rated on a scale of 0 to 5 stars along with a written review.  Each show is assigned an overall star rating based on the average of all the reviews received.  Minnesota Fringe also retains a staff of photographers who attend shows and return photographs for the festival's daily slide show.  During the six-week 2013 festival period, the site received over a million pageviews.

'''''Mise-en-scène''''' ({{IPA-fr|miz.ɑ̃.sɛn}} "placing on stage") is an expression used to describe the [[design]] aspect of a [[theatre]] or [[film]] production, which essentially means "visual theme" or "[[storytelling|telling a story]]"—both in [[visual arts|visually artful ways]] through [[storyboarding]], [[cinematography]] and [[stage design]], and in [[narrative|poetically artful ways]] through [[film direction|direction]]. It is also commonly used to refer to single scenes within the film to represent the film. ''Mise-en-scène'' has been called [[film criticism]]'s "grand undefined term".&lt;ref&gt;Brian Henderson, "The Long Take," in ''Movies and Methods: An Anthology'', ed. Bill Nichols (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976), 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition in film studies==
[[File:CABINET DES DR CALIGARI 01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The distinctive ''mise-en-scène'' of ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (Germany, 1920) features stark lighting and jagged architecture]]
When applied to the cinema, ''mise-en-scène'' refers to everything that appears before the [[camera]] and its arrangement—[[composition (visual arts)|composition]], [[Set construction|sets]], [[Theatrical properties|props]], [[actor]]s, costumes, and lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bordwell, David |author2=Thompson, Kristin | title=Film Art: An Introduction, 7th ed. | location=New York | publisher=McGraw–Hill  | year=2003 | isbn=0-07-248455-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "mise-en-scène", along with the cinematography and editing of a film, influence the [[verisimilitude]] or believability of a film in the eyes of its viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Connell, Joanne. "Film tourism – Evolution, progress and prospects." Tourism [[Management]] (October 2012), 33 (5), pp. 1007–1029&lt;/ref&gt; The various elements of design help express a film's vision by generating a sense of time and space, as well as setting a mood, and sometimes suggesting a character's state of mind.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Barsam, Richard Meran., and Dave Monahan. Looking at Movies: An Introduction to Film. New York: W.W. Norton &amp;, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; "Mise-en-scène" also includes the composition, which consists of the positioning and movement of actors, as well as objects, in the shot.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These are all the areas overseen by the [[Theatre director|director]]. One of the most important people that collaborates with the director is the [[production designer]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These two work closely to perfect all of the aspects of the "mise-en-scène" a considerable amount of time before the actual photography even begins.&lt;ref name="Pramaggiore, Maria 2005"&gt;Pramaggiore, Maria, and Tom Wallis. Film: A Critical Introduction. Boston: Laurence King, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The production designer is generally responsible for the general look of the movie, leading various departments that are in charge of individual sets, locations, props, and costumes, among other things.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  [[Andre Bazin]], a well-known [[French people|French]] [[film critic]] and [[film theorist]], describes the mise-en-scene [[aesthetic]] as emphasizing choreographed movement within the scene rather than through editing.&lt;ref name="Pramaggiore, Maria 2005"/&gt;

Because of its relationship to shot blocking, ''mise-en-scène'' is also a term sometimes used among professional [[screenwriters]] to indicate descriptive (action) paragraphs between the dialog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edgar-Hunt|first=Robert, John Marland and James Richards|title=Basics Film-Making: Screenwriting|year=2009|publisher=AVA Publishing|location=Lausanne|isbn=2-940373-89-2|pages=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jv-GsqMLs2UC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: An important element of "putting in the scene" is set design—the setting of a scene and the objects (props) visible in a scene. Set design can be used to amplify character emotion or the dominant mood, which has physical, social, psychological, emotional, economic and cultural significance in film.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; One of the most important decisions made by the [[production designer]] and director is deciding whether to shoot on location or on set. The main distinction between the two is that décor and props must be taken into consideration when shooting on set. However, shooting on set is more commonly done than shooting on location as a result of it proving to be more cost effective.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  
*;[[Cinematography#Lighting|Lighting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lighting|url=https://film110.pbworks.com/w/page/12610256/Lighting|work=film101|publisher=PBworks|accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: The intensity, direction, and quality of lighting can influence an audience's understanding of characters, actions, themes and mood.&lt;ref name="Pramaggiore, Maria 2005"/&gt; Light (and shade) can emphasize texture, shape, distance, mood, time of day or night, season, glamour; it affects the way colors are rendered, both in terms of hue and depth, and can focus attention on particular elements of the composition. Highlights, for example, call attention to shapes and textures, while shadows often conceal things, creating a sense of mystery or fear.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; For this reason, lighting must be thoroughly planned in advance to ensure its desired effect on an audience. [[Cinematographer]]s are a large part of this process, as they coordinate the camera and the lighting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*;[[Space]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 2: Mise-en-scene|url=http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/mise-en-scene.htm|work=Film Studies Program|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: The representation of space affects the reading of a film. Depth, proximity, size and proportions of the places and objects in a film can be manipulated through camera placement and lenses, lighting, set design, effectively determining mood or relationships between elements in the story world.
*;[[Composition (visual arts)|Composition]]&lt;ref name="Pramaggiore, Maria 2005"/&gt;
: The organization of objects, actors and space within the frame. One of the most important concepts with the regard to the [[Digital compositing|composition]] of a film is maintaining a balance of symmetry. This refers to having an equal distribution of light, colour, and objects and/or figures in a shot. Unbalanced composition can be used to emphasize certain elements of a film that the director wishes to be given particular attention to. This tool works because audiences are more inclined to pay attention to something off balance, as it may seem abnormal. Where the director places a character can also vary depending on the importance of the role.

: There is enormous historical and cultural variation in performance styles in the cinema. In the early years of cinema, stage acting and film acting were difficult to differentiate, as most film actors had previously been stage actors and therefore knew no other method of acting.&lt;ref name="Pramaggiore, Maria 2005"/&gt;  Eventually, early melodramatic styles, clearly indebted to the 19th century theater, gave way in Western cinema to a relatively naturalistic style. This more naturalistic style of acting is largely influenced by [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]'s theory of [[method acting]], which involves the actor fully immersing themselves in their character.&lt;ref name="Pramaggiore, Maria 2005"/&gt;

In [[Japanese art]], ''mitate-e'' ({{lang|ja|見立絵}}) is a subgenre of [[ukiyo-e]] that employs allusions, puns, and incongruities, often to parody classical art or events.

The term derives from two roots: ''mitateru'' ({{lang|ja|見立る}}, "to liken one thing to another"){{efn|''Mitateru'' has a number of other meanings not relevant to ''mitate-e''.{{sfn|Clark|1997|p=7}} }} and ''e'' ({{lang|ja|絵}}, "picture").  The ''mitate'' technique arose first in poetry and became prominent during the [[Heian period]] (794–1185).  [[Haiku]] poets revived the technique during the [[Edo period]] (1603–1868), from which it spread to the other arts of the era.{{sfn|Clark|1997|p=7}}  Such works typically employ allusions, puns, and incongruities, and frequently recall classical artworks.{{sfn|Clark|1997|pp=9–10}}

In the context of ukiyo-e, ''mitate-e'' is often translated into English as "parody picture".{{sfn|Clark|1997|p=7}}  This usage of the term arose much later; the term itself was used in different ways during the Edo period.  Those works today called ''mitate-e'' used different labels at the time, such as ''fūryū'' ({{lang|ja|風流}}, "elegant" or "fashionable"){{sfn|Clark|1997|p=11}} which appeared frequently in the 18th century on works by [[Okumura Masanobu]] (1686–1764) and [[Suzuki Harunobu]] (1725–1770).{{sfn|Clark|1997|p=12}}

'''''Monarch''''' is a British [[costume drama]] involving [[Henry VIII]]. It was written and directed by [[John Walsh (filmmaker)|John Walsh]] and released in 2000 at the [[Mill Valley Film Festival]]. It was re-released in 2014 after the film negative, thought lost, was rediscovered.

==Plot==
''Monarch'' is part fact, part fiction and unfolds around one night in the life of a hated king susceptible to assassination, and paranoid with the thought of his own mortality. The film is set in just one night when the injured Henry VIII arrives at a manor house closed for the season. Henry is without the power of his throne. He is vulnerable to those around him and to his own mental issues. He had left England financially and morally bankrupt; his collection of enemies became his only constant.

In an ''Irish Post'' interview, Walsh said “Often you can find out more about someone in a small time frame rather than you can if the two-hour film spans their whole life. Most bio-pics become little more than a montage of facts. If you confine a character to that time frame you can find out more about them.”&lt;ref name="Balasundaram"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Balasundaram |first1=Nemesha |title=Rare TP McKenna film to be screened after original tapes recovered |url=https://www.irishpost.com/entertainment/london-irish-director-reveals-archive-henry-viii-film-tapes-almost-lost-32166#comment-364005 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=Irish Post |date=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cast ==
[[T. P. McKenna]] plays Henry VIII, while [[Jean Marsh]] plays an amalgamation of his ex-wives. [[Peter Miles (English actor)|Peter Miles]] played a courtier to King Henry. [[James Coombes (actor)|James Coombes]] (known for his [[James Bond]] style role in the [[Cadbury]] chocolate [[Milk Tray]] advertisements popular on UK television)&lt;ref name="MilkTray"&gt;{{cite news |title=Milk Tray Man is back, and all because the lady loves it |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/shopping-and-consumer-news/11920070/Milk-Tray-Man-is-back-and-all-because-the-lady-loves....html |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=Telegraph |date=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; played the King's personal protection guard.

==Production==
It was shot on [[35 mm film|35mm]] [[Kodak]] 5287 stock using [[Arriflex]] cameras. Principal photography commenced in October 1996 at [[Charlton House]] in south London, making it the only film about Henry VIII entirely shot in the borough where he was born: [[Greenwich]].&lt;ref name="Bishop"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bishop |first1=Rachel |title="Tudor Whodunnit" filmed in Greenwich brought back to life |url=https://archive.fo/20141117163213/http://www.wharf.co.uk/2014/06/tudor-whodunnit-filmed-in-gree.html#selection-127.0-127.58 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=The Wharf (archived copy) |date=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weekender-2017"&gt;{{cite news |title=Monarch back at Charlton House – film re-mastered for DVD and iTunes |url=https://www.weekender.co.uk/articles/uncategorised/monarch-back-charlton-house-film-re-mastered-dvd-itunes/ |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=Weekender |date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] building served as the main location, with filming taking place inside and outside the house. The gardens were the backdrop for the opening title sequence. The Grand Salon and the Long Gallery featured heavily for the film’s dramatic scenes with Henry VIII. The house's clock tower was also utilised as the hiding place for Will, the ground-keeper's son, who hid from men who break into the house. Although set at night much of the filming took place during the day; black drapes were hung outside of the building to create a night effect.

In an interview with newspaper ''The Greenwich Visitor'' (page 5), Walsh discussed how he wanted his depiction of Henry VIII to be more grounded and less like those portrayals from Hollywood. He also discussed the difficulty of filming on a location and how the film benefited from using 35mm Kodak film stock.&lt;ref&gt;https://issuu.com/greenwichvisitor/docs/gv42.whole&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 a remastered version of ''Monarch'' was released following discovery of the original film negative, previously thought lost.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mackenzie |first1=Steven |title=Lost joys: Directors reveal searches for missing movies |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26420152 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bishop"/&gt; The remastered version premiered on 14 September 2014 at London's [[Tricycle Theatre]].&lt;ref name="Palmer-29Aug2014"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Palmer |first1=Jim |title=Critically acclaimed movie Monarch shot in Charlton by Greenwich-based John Walsh set for high definition re-release |url=http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/11441818.display/ |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=News Shopper |date=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Balasundaram"/&gt; Walsh discussed the issues around finding the lost negatives for ''Monarch'' and other lost projects with [[BBC Radio 2]]'s [[Janice Long]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Walsh - Spoken word session (18 April 2014) |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01xn3p1 |website=BBC Radio 2 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration===
Restoration was completed at Premier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.premiercomms.com/work/2014/Monarch.php# |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422225752/http://www.premiercomms.com/work/2014/Monarch.php# |archive-date=22 April 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film scanning and restoration team worked closely with director John Walsh, re-mastering from the original 35mm colour camera negative after it was discovered in a vault almost 20 years after it was originally filmed. In an interview about the project for the [[BBC]], John Walsh explained:

:"When we located the project we found more than we bargained for with over 52 cans of various footage from film trims, cutting copies and work prints. We didn't know if the original camera negative would be amongst all of this haul. After a close examination we were delighted to find all of the original camera negative was there and in good shape for its age."&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"/&gt;

Every frame of film was scanned in high definition at Premier and had more than 10,000 particles removed by hand by the restoration team. A new sound mix was also created from the original elements in Premier’s in-house audio department. In an article with ''The Weekender'' in November 2017 John discussed the importance restoration and preservation of older films to future-protect film such as ''Monarch'':

: "It will give today’s audiences the chance to see the wonderful performance of [[Jean Marsh]] and the towering presence of [[T. P. McKenna]], regarded as one of the great of his generation and rightly so in one of his most outstanding performances. ...
:Some films are lost for all time. From [[Alfred Hitchcock]] films to TV episodes of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and [[Tony Hancock]]. The Holy Grail of lost films for collectors is [[London After Midnight (film)|''London After Midnight'']]. The 1927 silent horror- mystery film starring [[Lon Chaney]] and produced by [[MGM]] has not been seen for almost 50 years.”&lt;ref name="Weekender-2017"/&gt;

== Reception ==
The film received strong reviews on its re-release in 2014 which were in contrast with the poor reviews in 2000. In 2000 Dennis Harvey wrote in [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] that "''Monarch'' plays out an OK premise to results at once turgid and ridiculous." and describes McKenna's performance as "hammy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/reviews/monarch-1200464656/|title=Monarch|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|date=2000-10-23|work=Variety|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014 the ''[[Radio Times]]'' film critic Jeremy Aspinall called it "a fascinating, haunting little gem, with a richly nuanced performance from McKenna".&lt;ref name="Aspinall"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Aspinall |first1=Jeremy |title=Monarch |url=https://www.radiotimes.com/film/cvvst7/monarch/ |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=Radio Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The film's realistic approach was noted by the [[BBFC]] who certified it a 15 on the basis that it "contains strong bloody violence".&lt;ref name="BBFC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Monarch |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/monarch-video |website=BBFC |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
''Monarch'' was released for the first time on [[DVD]] on 7 April 2014 by [[FremantleMedia]]. It included extras on the making of the film and the restoration process. A high definition version is also available to view on [[iTunes]].&lt;ref&gt;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/monarch-2000/id849697291&lt;/ref&gt;

''DVD Compare'' said "The film features an extraordinary British cast, is well written, and is perfectly paced."&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scott |first1=Samuel |title=Monarch |url=http://www.dvdcompare.net/review.php?rid=3294 |website=DVD Compare |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Movie Waffler'' gave the film four stars for the main feature and four stars for the DVD extras, saying “McKenna is the beating heart of ''Monarch'', part wounded bear, part Augustus Gloop petulance.” It adds “This menacingly pessimistic view of British history and government is an immensely entertaining gothic melodrama, the creepy details that Walsh weaves into the film.”&lt;ref name="Poole"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Poole |first1=Benjamin |title=Monarch |url=http://www.themoviewaffler.com/2017/11/dvd-review-monarch-2000.html |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=The Movie Waffler |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Monument to the Unknown Soldier''' ({{lang-bg|Паметник на Незнайния воин}}, ''Pametnik na Neznayniya voin'') is a monument in the centre of [[Sofia]], the capital of [[Bulgaria]], located just next to the 6th-century [[Church of St Sophia, Sofia|Church of St Sophia]], on 2 Paris Street. The monument commemorates the hundreds of thousands of Bulgarian soldiers who died in wars defending their homeland. Ceremonies involving the [[President of Bulgaria]] and foreign state leaders are often performed here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=101653 Sofia News Agency, "Bulgaria Celebrates National Liberation Day", March 3, 2009] Retrieved December 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.act.nato.int/multimedia/archive/42-news-stories/676-sact-visits-bulgaria NATO/OTAN "NATO Supreme Allied Commander, French Air Force General Stephane Abrial visits Bulgaria", July 1, 2011] Retrieved December 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The monument was designed by architect Nikola Nikolov and opened on September 22, 1981, the [[1300th Anniversary of the Bulgarian State|1300th anniversary]] of establishment of the [[First Bulgarian State|Bulgarian state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=115891 Sofia News Agency, "Sofia City Hall Guards Unknown Soldier Monument", May 4, 2010] Retrieved December 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The Monument to the Unknown Soldier features an [[eternal flame]], turf from [[Stara Zagora]] and [[Shipka Pass]], sites of two of the most important battles of the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78|Russo-Turkish War of Liberation]] (the [[Battle of Stara Zagora]] and the [[Battle of Shipka Pass]]), a sculpture of a [[lion]] (a national symbol of Bulgaria) by the noted sculptor [[Andrey Nikolov]], as well as a stone inscription of a stanza (part of ''The New Graveyard Above Slivnitsa'' 1885 poem) by the national writer [[Ivan Vazov]]:
{{cquote|
&lt;small&gt;БЪЛГАРИЙО, ЗА ТЕБЕ ТЕ УМРЯХА,&lt;br&gt;
ЕДНА БЕ ТИ ДОСТОЙНА ЗАРАД ТЯХ&lt;br&gt;
И ТЕ ЗА ТЕБ ДОСТОЙНИ, МАЙКО, БЯХА!&lt;/small&gt;}}
{{cquote|
&lt;small&gt;O BULGARIA, FOR YOU THEY DIED,&lt;br&gt;
ONLY ONE WERE YOU WORTHY OF THEM&lt;br&gt;
AND THEY OF YOU WORTHY, O MOTHER, WERE!&lt;/small&gt;}}
[[File:Unknown-soldier-sofia-3-lion.jpg|thumb|The lion sculpture]]

After the end of the First World War, a group of Bulgarians proposed building the monument. However, strong opposition to the building of this monument arose. Some Bulgarian intellectuals argued that a monument of an [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|unknown soldier]] is unacceptable since it would imply that the names of the soldiers have been forgotten. "Not a single soldier shall be forgotten who gave his life in this war and in all other wars for the freedom of Bulgaria!".{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The monument was designed but was not displayed because of the above-mentioned arguments. The lion itself was considered an abuse for a long time because it was sitting. The pose was considered a metaphor of surrender to the national ideas.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

'''''My Uncle Oswald''''' is an adult novel written by [[Roald Dahl]].

The novel stars [[Uncle Oswald]], a character who previously appeared in "[[The Visitor (Roald Dahl)|The Visitor]]" and "[[Bitch (short story)|Bitch]]", two short stories also written by Roald Dahl (and which can be both found in the book ''[[Switch Bitch]]''). Dahl's novel was published in 1979.

== Plot summary==
{{expand section|date=March 2012}}
Oswald Hendryks Cornelius, an extremely attractive and wealthy bounder, was the greatest fornicator of his time. In this instalment of his scorchingly frank memoirs, Uncle Oswald recounts his discovery of the sexually invigorating properties of the Sudanese Blister Beetle, and his cunning plan to steal what men are most willing to give away. Oswald and his partner in crime, the seductive and beautiful Yasmin Howcomely, travel all over Europe to retrieve the sperm of powerful, rich and artistic men.

They freeze the sperm with the plan of selling it to rich women who wish to create children using the genes of the rich and intelligent.

Oswald's accomplice tried to use the aphrodisiac on [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon]] of Norway, but her plan misfires when she accidentally eats the aphrodisiac carrying chocolate she intended to serve the king. She gets thrown out of the king's castle after she falls into a temporary state of [[nymphomania]] and tries to rape him.

==Characters==
===Uncle Oswald===
{{main|Uncle Oswald}}
''Oswald Hendryks Cornelius'': The nameless narrator has revealed snippets of the lovable, lascivious Uncle Oswald's life in other collections, but this is the only novel—brief though it is—dedicated solely to the diaries of "the greatest fornicator of all time." Inspired by stories of the aphrodisiac powers of the Sudanese blister beetle, the palpable seductiveness of the lovely Yasmin Howcomely, and the scientific know-how of Professor A. R. Woresley, Uncle Oswald anticipates the concept of the Nobel sperm bank by some 40 years, flim-flamming crowned heads, great artists, and eccentric geniuses into making "donations." The life of a commercial sperm broker has a few surprises even for a sophisticated bon vivant, and Dahl manages his signature sting-in-the-tail ending even in one of his lightest comic works.

==Reception==
In his 1980 review, [[Vance Bourjaily]] said:&lt;ref&gt;Bourjaily, Vance (1980), "Civilized Ribaldry," ''The New York Times,'' 20 April 1980, p. BR4&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|What can be said is that "My Uncle Oswald" provides four or five hours of effortless reading and some amusing scenes, mostly of the kind film makers have taught us to call soft porn—so soft, indeed, that at times they turn out almost fluffy.

The tone is that of a gentleman telling ribald anecdotes to his male guests after dinner. The leer is civilized... the dialog gets mean and raunchy, but the physical detail is kept decorous.... Mr. Dahl's guests are not invited to vicarious orgy, then, nor will they hear a disguised lecture by a wicked satirist of morals and manners.... Summer reading.}}

[[Christopher Lehmann-Haupt]] called it "a festival of bad taste that is at heart so innocent that we soon forgive it and enjoy ourselves," "thoroughly juvenile fun," and said "I haven't had so much fun of this sort since my last all-night joke-telling session at summer camp."&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann-Haupt, Christopher (1980), "Books of the Times," ''The New York Times,'' 29 April 1980, p. C9&lt;/ref&gt;

An {{nihongo|'''obi'''|帯}} is a  strip of paper looped around a book or other product. This extends the term ''[[Obi (sash)|obi]]'' used for Japanese clothing; it is written with the same ''[[kanji]].'' It is also referred to as a {{Nihongo||襷|tasuki}} (another kimono accessory), or more narrowly as {{Nihongo||帯紙|obigami|belt paper}}.

==For books==
Many books in Japan are supplied with an ''obi'', which is normally added outside any [[dust jacket]]. However, a book in a slipcase may have an ''obi'' around the slipcase.

In English, the term ''belly-band'' is sometimes used instead.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Jeff Ladd, "[http://5b4.blogspot.com/2010/02/errata-editions-limited-edition-sets.html Errata Editions Limited Edition Sets]", 5B4 Photography and Books, 26 February 2010. Accessed 7 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other applications==
The term is also used for a strip that is looped over one side (usually on the left) or folded over the top of [[LP record|LP albums]] released in Japan, and folded over the left side of music [[Compact Disc|CDs]], [[video game]]s, [[LaserDisc]]s, or [[DVD]]s. This is also called ''tasuki.'' ''Obi'' are unique to Japan and are used to provide the title of the product, track listings (if applicable), price, catalog number and information on related releases in Japanese.

The '''''Pietà''''' or '''''Sexta Angustia''''' (1616 - 1619) is a work of [[Baroque sculpture]] by [[Gregorio Fernández]], housed in the [[National Sculpture Museum (Valladolid)|National Museum of Sculpture]] in [[Valladolid]], Spain. The statue was commissioned by the [[Illustrious Penitential Brotherhood of Our Lady of Anguish]]. It is one of the best known of the five sculptures of the same theme by the artist.

The sculpture shows the Virgin Mary holding up one hand with Christ's body slumped lifeless to the floor, by her feet. It was part of a "[[paso]]" which paraded in religious [[procession]]s during Holly Week, together with the sculptures of the [[penitent thief|good thief]] and the [[impenitent thief]], and Saint John and the Virgin Mary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1577">'''Quantum Aesthetics''' is a movement that was inaugurated by [[Gregorio Morales]] at the end of the 1990s with his work “El cadaver de Balzac” or ''[[Balzac]]'s Corpse'' (1998). Here he defined the objectives of the movement in the phrase “mystery and difference”.

Later the '''Quantum Aesthetics Group''' arose, formed by novelists, poets, painters, photographers, film producers, models… Gregorio Morales has applied these [[aesthetics]] not only to his novels, such as “Nómadas del Tiempo” or ''Nomads of Time'' (2005), but also to his poetry books such as “Canto Cuántico” or ''Quantum Song'' (2003). Here he enters emotively in the world of subatomic physics and the human mind. Other known artists in this movement are the painter [[Xaverio]], the poets [[Francisco Plata]] and [[Miguel Ángel Contreras]], the film director [[Julio Medem]] and the North American musician [[Lawrence Axerold]].

'''''Rideau, Cruchon et Compotier''''' is a [[painting]] created circa 1893 to 1894 by [[France|French]] [[artist]] [[Paul Cézanne]] (19 January 1839 – 22 October 1906). It is considered [[List of most expensive paintings|the most expensive]] [[still life]] ever sold at an auction.

Cézanne was famous for painting still lifes which expressed complex emotions while still being based upon carefully observed reality. Paintings of this type would eventually lead to the creation of new art styles during the 20th century such as [[Cubism]].

==Ownership history==

The painting went through the possession of [[Paris]] dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]], [[Cornelis Hoogendijk]], [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], [[Albert C. Barnes]], and the [[Carroll Carstairs]] Gallery.  This painting was sold at [[Sotheby's]], [[New York City]] on 10 May 1999 for $60,502,500 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US-GDP|60.5025|1999|r=1}} million in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{Inflation-fn|US-GDP}}), a record price, during the sale of the [[Whitney family]] collection. The painting was later resold at a loss.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2079">A '''''répétiteur''''' (from [[French language|French]] [[verb]] ''répéter'' meaning "to repeat, to go over, to learn, to [[rehearsal|rehearse]]"&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;) is an accompanist, tutor or coach of ballet dancers or opera dancers.

== Opera ==
In [[opera]], a ''répétiteur'' is the person responsible for coaching singers and playing the [[piano]] for music and production rehearsals.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50203075?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=repetiteur&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 Oxford English Dictionary], Oxford University Press, accessed 27 July 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; When coaching solo singers or choir members, the ''répétiteur'' will take on a number of the roles of a [[vocal coach]]: advising singers on how to improve their pitch and pronunciation, and correcting note or phrasing errors.

''Répétiteurs'' are skilled musicians who have strong [[sight-reading]] and score reading skills. In addition to being able to sight read piano parts, a ''répétiteur'' can play on the piano an orchestral score reducing it in real-time ([[orchestral reduction]]), by reading from a large open score of all of the instruments and voice parts. ''Répétiteurs'' are also skilled in following the directions of a conductor, in terms of changing the tempo, pausing, or adding other nuances.

== Ballet ==
In [[ballet]], a ''répétiteur'' teaches the steps and interpretation of the roles to some or all of the company performing a dance.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; Several late 20th-century choreographers, such as [[George Balanchine#External links|George Balanchine]], [[Jerome Robbins#External links|Jerome Robbins]] and [[Twyla Tharp]], have established trusts and appointed conservators—hand-picked dancers who have intimate knowledge of particular ballets—as ''répétiteurs'' of their works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4409">[[Australian]] [[composer]] [[Malcolm Williamson]] wrote his '''Symphony No. 7''' in 1984 to a joint commission from the Chamber Youth Strings of Melbourne and the [[Victoria (Australia)|State of Victoria]], [[Australia]]. It was written mostly at the composer's home in [[Sandon, Hertfordshire]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;''Malcolm Williamson: A 70th Birthday Tribute'' (Paul Conway)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Work==

[[Malcolm Williamson|Williamson]] was commissioned to write his Seventh Symphony by Dr Alexandra E. Cameron in 1984 on behalf of the Chamber Youth Strings of [[Melbourne]]. The piece originally had a dual purpose: to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the [[Victoria (Australia)|State of Victoria]], and to give the youth orchestra a showpiece to take on a European tour in 1985. Williamson enjoyed long and fruitful relationships with youth orchestras and other organisations throughout his long career, and also wrote his '''Symphony No. 5 ''Aquerò''''', the '''Little Mass of St. Bernadette''' and the ballet '''Heritage''' for young players, singers and dancers respectively. The score is dedicated to the memory of a long-time friend of Williamson's who died a year after the work's composition, Dr. Derek Goldfoot, husband of soprano Sybil Michelow (a staunch advocate of Williamson's vocal music).&lt;ref&gt;''Malcolm Williamson: A 70th Birthday Tribute'' (Paul Conway)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first performance of the symphony was planned for 10 January 1985 at [[Australia House]] in [[London]], but in the event only three of the four movements were played (the scherzo was omitted). This was due to the challenging nature of the music, which meant it was not possible for the youth orchestra to rehearse all the movements sufficiently in time. The first complete performance of the symphony was given by the Chamber Youth Strings of Melbourne in the Irving Hall of the Lauriston Girls' School, [[Melbourne]], on 12 August 1985.&lt;ref&gt;''Malcolm Williamson: A Mischievous Muse'' (Paul Harris &amp; Anthony Meredith)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes on the Symphony==

Since part of the commission for the '''Symphony No. 7''' was to celebrate the 150th anniversary of [[Victoria (Australia)|The State of Victoria]], [[Malcolm Williamson|Williamson]] decided to take Australian landscape and culture as the basis of his [[symphony]], not unlike the '''Symphony No. 6''' of 1982.&lt;ref&gt;''Malcolm Williamson: A 70th Birthday Tribute'' (Paul Conway)&lt;/ref&gt; Although each movement has a separate impetus behind it, the whole work is unified by the idea of (in the composer's words) "the unforeseen cross-pollination of ethnic groups that has enriched Australian life".&lt;ref&gt;SIGCD053&lt;/ref&gt; This "cross-pollination" is represented by a portrait of the [[Kelly Gang]] in the first movement (illuminating the strong [[Irish people|Irish]] connection), [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] dances in the [[scherzo]] (highlighting the thriving Macedonian community of [[Melbourne]]), and further [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian]] references in the finale. A celebration of the vivid landscape of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] is most overt in the introverted third movement, an eight-minute lament of great poise capturing the majesty of the [[Dandenongs]] and [[Wilsons Promontory]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Meredith, p.404&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

The [[symphony]] is broken up into four clearly defined [[Movement (music)|movements]], as follows:

*'''''I.''''' ''Andante - Allegro vivo - Andante''
*'''''II.''''' ''Allegro molto''
*'''''III.''''' ''Andante''
*'''''IV.''''' ''Allegro maestoso ma non troppo''&lt;ref&gt;SIGCD053&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orchestration==

Williamson's Seventh [[Symphony]] requires the least resources of all his symphonies. Unlike the massive [[orchestral]] Sixth Symphony ''Liturgy of Homage'' (1982) or the [[choral]]-[[orchestral]] Third Symphony ''The Icy Mirror'' of 1973, the Seventh Symphony is scored for [[string orchestra]] only (consisting of [[violins]], [[violas]], [[celli]] and [[double basses]]). This gives the work its unique sense of [[chamber music|chamber]]-like intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;SIGCD053&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''French Union of Modern Artists''' ({{lang-fr|Union des artistes modernes}}; '''UAM''') was a movement made up of decorative artists and [[architect]]s founded in France on 15 May 1929&lt;ref&gt;Arlette Barré-Despond &amp; Suzanne Tise, Jourdain, Rizzoli NY 1991, Copyright 1988 Editions du Regard, p.330&lt;/ref&gt; and active until 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Initially made up of around 20 dissidents of the [[Société des Artistes-Décorateurs]] (SAD) and led by [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]], the UAM offered a strong and militant alternative to the SAD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Young makers of [[jewellery]] joined the union with aims to create works of art in their field through the use of less expensive materials, making it more accessible than the current trend of expensive ''bijoux blancs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

UAM members participated annually in the [[Salon d'Automne]] with an exhibit created by 'The Group', and emphasized design over decoration. Interiors were designed to function with [[concrete]], [[steel]] and [[glass]] [[architecture]] and [[furniture]] made of metallic structures was arranged within, without additional decoration. Their message was amplified through various shows and manifesto's (its first in 1934 'For [[Modern Art]] as a Frame for [[Contemporary]] Life') and activity peaked at the 1937 [[World's Fair]] in [[Paris]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''''The Great Escape''''' is an insider's account by [[Australian]] [[writer]] [[Paul Brickhill]] of the 1944 [[Stalag Luft III#The great escape|mass escape]] from the German [[prisoner of war]] camp [[Stalag Luft III]] for British and Commonwealth airmen.  As a prisoner in the camp, he participated in the escape plan but was debarred from the actual escape 'along with three or four others on grounds of claustrophobia'.&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill, Paul: ''The Great Escape'', foreword&lt;/ref&gt;  The introduction to the book is written by George Harsh, an American POW at Stalag Luft III. This book was made into the 1963 film [[The Great Escape (film)|''The Great Escape'']].

== Summary ==
[[File:Great escape harry exit.jpg|thumb|View looking through fence to where tunnel Harry exited, just shy of the tree line.]]
The book covers the planning, execution and aftermath of what became known as ''The Great Escape''. Other escape attempts (such as the [[The Wooden Horse|Wooden Horse]]) are mentioned as well as the postwar hunt for the [[Gestapo]] agents who murdered fifty of the escapees on Hitler's direct order. The book was published in 1950. Brickhill, a journalist before and after the war, had previously written the story four different ways, initially as a BBC talk, then as newspaper and ''Reader's Digest'' articles, and in the 1946 book ''Escape to Danger'' which he co-wrote with Conrad Norton. By the time of the 1950 book, Brickhill had eliminated some of the less heroic aspects of the story, including the fact that a large proportion of the compound's population had no interest in the escape.&lt;ref&gt;Dando-Collins, ''The Hero Maker''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the book is focused on [[Royal Air Force]] [[Squadron Leader]] [[Roger Bushell]], also known as "''Big X''", including his capture, early escape attempts, and [[Stalag Luft III#The "Great Escape"|planning of the escape]]. All the major participants and their exploits are described by Brickhill. Among these are Tim Walenn, the principal forger, who 'gave his factory the code name of "[[Dean and Dawson]]", after a British travel agency';&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill, Paul: ''The Great Escape'', p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Al Hake, the compass maker;&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill, Paul: ''The Great Escape'', p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Des Plunkett, the ingenious chief map tracer, who made a [[mimeograph]] for reproducing maps;&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill, Paul: ''The Great Escape'', p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; and Tommy Guest, who ran a team of tailors.&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill, Paul: ''The Great Escape'', p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Major [[Johnnie Dodge|John Dodge]], who was related by marriage to [[Winston Churchill]], was one of the escapees. The German officers and guards (called 'goons' by the prisoners) included teams of 'ferrets' who crawled about under the raised huts looking for signs of tunnels. They were carefully watched by teams of POW 'stooges', one of whom was Paul Brickhill, 'boss of a gang of "stooges" guarding the forgers'.&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill, Paul: ''The Great Escape'', foreword&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, seventy-six men escaped. Seventy-three were recaptured and fifty of those were shot by the Gestapo against the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|Geneva Convention]] which stated that POW's could not be killed for trying to escape.  Four of the remaining twenty-three later tunnelled out of [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] (a [[concentration camp]]), but were recaptured and chained to the floor of their cells.&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill, Paul: ''The Great Escape'', p. 285–289&lt;/ref&gt;  One of them, Major [[Johnnie Dodge|John Dodge]], was released to secure a cease-fire.&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill, Paul: ''The Great Escape'', p. 290–294&lt;/ref&gt; Three made it home safely.

The book is dedicated "to The Fifty".

In the aftermath of the escape, according to Brickhill, 5,000,000 Germans spent time looking for the prisoners, many of them full-time for weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill, Paul: ''The Great Escape'', p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brickhill's biographer Stephen Dando-Collins, while this may have been an aspiration of the escapees, there is no foundation for such an exaggerated claim, which added to the story's heroic narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Dando-Collins, ''The Hero Maker'' p. 376&lt;/ref&gt;

== The tunnels ==
Three tunnels were dug for the escape.  They were named ''Tom'', ''Dick'', and ''Harry''.  The operation was so secretive that everyone was to refer to each tunnel by its name.  Bushell took this so seriously that he threatened to court-martial anyone who even uttered the word "tunnel" aloud.&lt;ref&gt;Brickhill, Paul: ''The Great Escape'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Tom'' was dug in hut 123 and extended west into the forest.  It was found by the Germans and dynamited.  ''Dick'' was dug in the shower room of hut 122 and had the most secure trap door.  It was to go in the same direction as ''Tom'' and the prisoners decided that the hut would not be a suspected tunnel site as it was more inward than the others.  ''Dick'' was abandoned for escape purposes because the area where it would have surfaced was cleared for camp expansion.  ''Dick'' was then used to store dirt, supplies, and as a workshop.  ''Harry'', which was in hut 104, was the tunnel ultimately used for the escape.  It was discovered as the escape was in progress with only seventy-six of the planned two hundred and twenty prisoners free.  To avoid the disaster of ''Tom'', ''Harry'' was filled with sewage, sand, and sealed with cement.  After the escape, the prisoners started digging another tunnel called ''George'', but this was abandoned when the camp was evacuated.

== After 'The Great Escape' ==
On October 2, 2012, [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] released ''Human Game: The True Story of the 'Great Escape' Murders and the Hunt for the Gestapo Gunmen'' by author and journalist Simon Read. The book details the 50 murders that took place following the escape and the three-year manhunt by the Royal Air Force to bring the killers to justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://simon-read.com/war-of-words/|title=My Books &lt;&lt; Simon Read}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Human-Game-Escape-Murders-Gestapo/dp/0425252736/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332220047&amp;sr=1-1|title=Human Game: The True Story of the 'Great Escape' Murders and the Hunt for the Gestapo Gunmen|last=Read|first=Simon|date=October 2, 2012|publisher=[[Berkley Hardcover]]|isbn=0425252736|edition=1|accessdate=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Visual literacy''' is the ability to [[Interpreting|interpret]], negotiate, and make meaning from information presented in the form of an [[image]], extending the meaning of [[literacy]], which commonly signifies interpretation of a written or printed [[Written language|text]].  Visual literacy is based on the idea that [[pictures]] can be "read" and that meaning can be through a process of reading.

==Historical Background==
The notion of visual literacy has been around for quite some time.  Classical and Medieval theories of memory and learning, for instance, placed a strong emphases on how the visual format of words and lines affected the ordering of information in the mind.  During the Enlightenment new emphasis was placed on training the senses through print and manuscript technologies in a way that benefitted the rising middle class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Shape of Knowledge: Children and the Visual Culture of Literacy and Numeracy|journal=Science in Context|year=2013|volume=26|pages=215–245|url=https://www.academia.edu/1817033/The_Shape_of_Knowledge_Children_and_the_Visual_Culture_of_Literacy_and_Numeracy_Science_in_Context_26_2013_215-245|doi=10.1017/s0269889713000045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Mathew Daniel|title=The Child Writer: Graphic Literacy and the Scottish Educational System, 1700–1820|journal=History of Education|date=2016|volume=45|pages=695–718|url=https://www.academia.edu/23569976/The_Child_Writer_Graphic_Literacy_and_the_Scottish_Educational_System_1700_1820_History_of_Education_45_2016_695-718}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to learning to read visual material like tables and figures, many schoolchildren learned how to write and draw in graphic patterns that made their notes more accessible and easier to access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Nature of Notebooks: How Enlightenment Schoolchildren Transformed the Tabula Rasa|journal=Journal of British Studies|date=2018|volume=57|page=275-307|url=https://www.academia.edu/34448924/The_Nature_of_Notebooks_How_Enlightenment_Schoolchildren_Transformed_the_Tabula_Rasa_Journal_of_British_Studies_57_2018_275-307}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the nineteenth century visual literacy was a core component of the national educations systems that were emerging in Europe and North America, with educational reformers like Sir John Lubbock arguing for visual tools like diagrams and models to be used in the classroom.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Modern Visual Literacy==
The term "visual literacy" is credited to John Debes, co-founder of the [[International Visual Literacy Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031204235851/http://ivla.org/org_what_vis_lit.htm What is visual literacy?], [http://www.ivla.org/ International Visual Literacy Association]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969 Debes offered a tentative definition of the concept: "Visual literacy refers to a group of vision-competencies a human being can develop by seeing and at the same time having and integrating other sensory experiences."&lt;ref&gt;Avgerinou, M. &amp; Ericson, J. (1997). "[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119145211/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 A review of the concept of visual literacy]", ''British Journal of Educational Technology'', 28(4), 280-291.&lt;/ref&gt;  A white paper drawn up in January 2004, defines visual literacy as "understanding how people perceive objects, interpret what they see, and what they learn from them".&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James 2010. The concept of visual literacy, and its limitations, In: Visual Literacy, ed. James Elkins.  Routledge, New York. pgs 217.&lt;/ref&gt; However, because multiple disciplines such as [[visual literacy in education]], [[art history]] and [[criticism]], [[rhetoric]], [[semiotics]], [[philosophy]], [[information design]], and [[graphic design]] make use of the term visual literacy, arriving at a common definition of visual literacy has been contested since its first appearance in professional publications.

Since technological advances continue to develop at an unprecedented rate, educators are increasingly promoting the learning of visual literacies as indispensable to life in the [[Information Age|information age]].  Similar to [[Literacy|linguistic literacy]] ([[meaning-making]] derived from written or oral human language) commonly taught in schools, most educators would agree that literacy in the 21st Century has a wider scope.&lt;ref&gt;Riddle, J. (2009). ''Engaging the Eye Generation: Visual Literacy Strategies for the K-5 Classroom''. Stenhouse Publishers page 3.  {{ISBN|978-1-57110-749-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educators are recognizing the importance of helping students develop visual literacies in order to survive and communicate in a highly complex world.

[[File:Lascaux painting.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.7|Lascaux Cave painting]]

Many [[Academia|scholars]] from the New London Group&lt;ref name=NewLondon&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090708022433/http://www.informationhabitat.org/mw/index.php/The_New_London_School The New London School], Information Habitat wiki, [[Michigan State University]]&lt;/ref&gt; such as Courtney Cazden, [[James Paul Gee|James Gee]], [[Gunther Kress]], and [[Allan Luke]] advocate against the dichotomy of visual literacy versus linguistic literacy.  Instead, they stress the necessity of accepting the co-presence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kress|first =Gunther R.|authorlink=Gunther Kress|title=Literacy in the New Media Age |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-415-25356-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2vaNeafOoiYC&amp;dq=inauthor:Gunther+inauthor:Kress&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=0&amp;output=html&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  of linguistic literacies and visual literacies as interacting and interlacing modalities which complement one another in the meaning making process.

Visual literacy is not limited to modern [[mass media]] and new [[Technology|technologies]].  The graphic novel ''[[Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art|Understanding Comics]]'' by [[Scott McCloud]] discusses the history of narrative in visual media.  Also, animal drawings in ancient caves, such as the one in [[Lascaux]], [[France]], are early forms of visual literacy.  Hence, even though the name visual literacy itself as a label dates to the 1960s, the concept of reading signs and symbols is [[Prehistory|prehistoric]].

Visual literacy is the ability to evaluate, apply, or create conceptual visual representations. Skills include the evaluation of advantages and disadvantages of visual representations, to improve shortcomings, to use them to create and communicate knowledge, or to devise new ways of representing insights.  The didactic approach consists of rooting visualization in its application contexts, i.e. giving the necessary critical attitude, principles, tools and feedback to develop their own high-quality visualization formats for specific problems (problem-based learning). The commonalities of good visualization in diverse areas, and exploration of the specificities of visualization in the field of specialization (through real-life case studies).

Visual Literacy Standards for teaching in higher education were adopted by the [[Association of College &amp; Research Libraries]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/visualliteracy ACRL Visual Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education]&lt;/ref&gt; They were "developed over a period of 19 months, informed by current literature, shaped by input from multiple communities and organizations, reviewed by individuals from over 50 institutions, and approved by 3 ACRL committees and the ACRL Board of Directors".&lt;ref&gt;[http://acrlvislitstandards.wordpress.com/ ACRL Visual Literacy Standards&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

== Education ==
There are many different formats of visual literacy and also many different ways of teaching students how to interpret visual literacy. Questions to be asked when looking at visuals can be "What is going on in this photograph?" and "What comes to mind when you first look at this photograph?". This allows students to begin the analyzing process. When looking at visuals, students should be able to see, understand, think, create and communicate graphically. In order to do all, the student must always carefully observe.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Film director [[Martin Scorsese]] emphasizes how children should begin developing visual literacy skills at an early age. This involves exploring how ideas and emotions are expressed and the use of lighting to create an emotional or physiological point. He explains how there is a need for children to understand these concepts. Visual literacy is taught in many schools and is becoming a more popular subject throughout the years. With technology, images and visual presentations are flourishing more than ever.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

"'''What the Tortoise Said to Achilles'''", written by [[Lewis Carroll]] in 1895 for the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', is a brief allegorical dialogue on the foundations of [[logic]]. The title [[allusion|alludes]] to one of [[Zeno's paradoxes|Zeno's paradoxes of motion]], in which Achilles could never overtake the tortoise in a race. In Carroll's dialogue, the tortoise challenges Achilles to use the force of logic to make him accept the conclusion of a simple deductive argument. Ultimately, Achilles fails, because the clever tortoise leads him into an [[infinite regression]].

==Summary of the dialogue==
The discussion begins by considering the following logical argument:
* ''A'': "Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other" ([[Euclidean relation]], a weakened form of the [[transitive property]])
* ''B'': "The two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same"
* Therefore, ''Z'': "The two sides of this triangle are equal to each other"

The Tortoise asks Achilles whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and Achilles grants that it obviously does. The Tortoise then asks Achilles whether there might be a reader of [[Euclid]] who grants that the argument is ''logically valid'', as a ''sequence'', while denying that ''A'' and ''B'' are true. Achilles accepts that such a reader might exist, and that he would hold that ''if'' ''A'' and ''B'' are true, ''then'' ''Z'' must be true, while not yet accepting that ''A'' and ''B'' are true (that is, a reader who denies the premises).

The Tortoise then asks Achilles whether a second kind of reader might exist, who accepts that ''A'' and ''B'' are true, but who does ''not'' yet accept the principle that ''if'' ''A'' and ''B'' are both true, ''then'' ''Z'' must be true. Achilles grants the Tortoise that this second kind of reader might also exist. The Tortoise, then, asks Achilles to treat the Tortoise as a reader of this second kind. Achilles must now logically compel the Tortoise to accept that ''Z'' must be true. (The tortoise is a reader who denies the argument form itself; the [[syllogism]]'s conclusion, structure, or validity.)

After writing down ''A'', ''B'', and ''Z'' in his notebook, Achilles asks the Tortoise to accept the hypothetical:
* ''C'': "If ''A'' and ''B'' are true, ''Z'' must be true"

The Tortoise agrees to accept ''C'', if Achilles will write down what it has to accept in his notebook, making the new argument:
* ''A'': "Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other"
* ''B'': "The two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same"
* ''C'': "If ''A'' and ''B'' are true, ''Z'' must be true"
* Therefore, ''Z'': "The two sides of this triangle are equal to each other"

But now that the Tortoise accepts premise ''C'', it still refuses to accept the expanded argument. When Achilles demands that "If you accept ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'', you must accept ''Z''," the Tortoise remarks that that's ''another'' hypothetical proposition, and suggests even if it accepts ''C'', it could still fail to conclude ''Z'' if it did not see the truth of:
* ''D'': "If ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' are true, ''Z'' must be true"

The Tortoise continues to accept each hypothetical premise once Achilles writes it down, but denies that the conclusion necessarily follows, since each time it denies the hypothetical that if all the premises written down so far are true, ''Z'' must be true:
{{quote|"And at last we've got to the end of this ideal racecourse! Now that you accept ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' and ''D'', ''of course'' you accept ''Z''."

"Do I?" said the Tortoise innocently. "Let's make that quite clear. I accept ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' and ''D''. Suppose I ''still'' refused to accept ''Z''?"

"Then Logic would take you by the throat, and ''force'' you to do it!" Achilles triumphantly replied. "Logic would tell you, 'You can't help yourself. Now that you've accepted ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' and ''D'', you must accept ''Z''!' So you've no choice, you see."

"Whatever Logic is good enough to tell me is worth ''writing down''," said the Tortoise. "So enter it in your notebook, please. We will call it
{{block indent|(''E'') If ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' and ''D'' are true, ''Z'' must be true.}}

Until I've granted that, of course I needn't grant ''Z''. So it's quite a necessary step, you see?"

"I see," said Achilles; and there was a touch of sadness in his tone.}}

Thus, the list of premises continues to grow without end, leaving the argument always in the form:
* (1): "Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other"
* (2): "The two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same"
* (3): (1) and (2) ⇒ (Z)
* (4): (1) and (2) and (3) ⇒ (Z)
* ...
* (''n''): (1) and (2) and (3) and (4) and ... and (''n'' − 1) ⇒ (''Z'')
* Therefore, (''Z''): "The two sides of this triangle are equal to each other"

At each step, the Tortoise argues that even though he accepts all the premises that have been written down, there is some further premise (that if all of (1)&amp;ndash;(''n'') are true, then (''Z'') must be true) that it still needs to accept before it is compelled to accept that (''Z'') is true.

==Explanation==
Lewis Carroll was showing that there is a regressive problem that arises from ''[[modus ponens]]'' deductions. 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P \to Q,\; P}{\therefore Q}&lt;/math&gt;
Or, in words: proposition ''P'' (is true) implies ''Q'' (is true), and given ''P'', therefore ''Q''.

The regress problem arises because a prior principle is required to explain logical principles, here modus ponens, and once ''that'' principle is explained, ''another'' principle is required to explain ''that'' principle. Thus, if the causal chain is to continue, the argument falls into infinite regress. However, if a formal system is introduced where modus ponens is simply a [[rule of inference]] defined by the system, then it can be abided by simply because it is so. For example, chess has particular rules that simply go without question and players must abide by them because they form the very framework of the game. Likewise, a formal system of logic is defined by rules that are to be followed, by definition, without question. Having a defined formal system of logic stops the infinite regression{{mdash}}that is, the regression stops at the axioms or rules, per se, of the given game, system, etc.

In propositional logic the logical implication is defined as follows:

P implies Q  if and only if the proposition ''not P or Q'' is a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]].

Hence de modus ponens, [P ∧ (P → Q)] ⇒ Q, is a valid logical conclusion according to the definition of logical implication just stated. Demonstrating the logical implication simply translates into verifying that the compound truth table produces a tautology. But the tortoise does not accept on faith the rules of propositional logic that this explanation is founded upon. He asks that these rules, too, be subject to logical proof. The Tortoise and Achilles do not agree on any definition of logical implication.

In addition, the story hints at problems with the propositional solution. Within the system of propositional logic, no proposition or variable carries any semantic content. The moment any proposition or variable takes on semantic content, the problem arises again because semantic content runs outside the system. Thus, if the solution is to be said to work, then it is to be said to work solely within the given formal system, and not otherwise.

Some logicians (Kenneth Ross, Charles Wright) draw a firm distinction between the [[material conditional|conditional connective]] and the [[Logical consequence|implication relation]]. These logicians use the phrase ''not p or q'' for the conditional connective and the term ''implies'' for an asserted implication relation.

==Discussion==
Several philosophers have tried to resolve Carroll's paradox. [[Bertrand Russell]] discussed the paradox briefly in [http://fair-use.org/bertrand-russell/the-principles-of-mathematics/s.38 § 38 of ''The Principles of Mathematics''] (1903), distinguishing between ''implication'' (associated with the form "if ''p'', then ''q''"), which he held to be a relation between ''unasserted'' propositions, and ''inference'' (associated with the form "''p'', therefore ''q''"), which he held to be a relation between ''asserted'' propositions; having made this distinction, Russell could deny that the Tortoise's attempt to treat ''inferring'' ''Z'' from ''A'' and ''B'' as equivalent to, or dependent on, agreeing to the ''hypothetical'' "If ''A'' and ''B'' are true, then ''Z'' is true."

The [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinian]] philosopher [[Peter Winch]] discussed the paradox in ''The Idea of a Social Science and its Relation to Philosophy'' (1958), where he argued that the paradox showed that "the actual process of drawing an inference, which is after all at the heart of logic, is something which cannot be represented as a logical formula ... Learning to infer is not just a matter of being taught about explicit logical relations between propositions; it is learning ''to do'' something" (p.&amp;nbsp;57). Winch goes on to suggest that the moral of the dialogue is a particular case of a general lesson, to the effect that the proper ''application'' of rules governing a form of human activity cannot itself be summed up with a set of ''further'' rules, and so that "a form of human activity can never be summed up in a set of explicit precepts" (p.&amp;nbsp;53).

Carroll's dialogue is apparently the first description of an obstacle to [[conventionalism]] about logical truth,&lt;ref name="Maddy"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Philosophy of Logic | author=[[Penelope Maddy|Maddy, P.]] | journal=Bulletin of Symbolic Logic |date=December 2012  | volume=18 | issue=4 | pages=481–504 | doi=10.2178/bsl.1804010 | jstor=23316289}}&lt;/ref&gt; later reworked in more sober philosophical terms by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O.

Hofstadter's Tortoise is of the male sex, though the Tortoise's [[Gender-neutral language|sex is never specified]] by Carroll. The French translation of the book rendered the Tortoise's name as "Madame Tortue" because the word ''tortue'' is [[grammatical gender|grammatically]] feminine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1639">The '''Yuan Center of Art''' ({{zh|北京元艺术中心}}) is a multifunctional arts center and gallery located in the [[Haidian District|Haidian]] district of [[Beijing]], [[China]]. The center houses four large exhibition halls for visual art, an experimental theatre, conference and symposia spaces, and a restaurant. The design concept of the building integrates the elements of architectural [[minimalism]] with a traditional Chinese construction pattern called “jiugongge”.  A recent show, entitled ''After Culture: An Exhibition of Contemporary Chinese Painting'', featured the work of several major Chinese artists, including [[Ma Kelu]], [[Shang Yang]], [[Ma Lu]], [[Ding Fang]], and [[Peng Si]]. It was curated by [[Peng Feng]], the prominent art critic and Professor of [[Aesthetics]] at [[Peking University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://researchhouseforasianart.org/scholars.html Western and Chinese Scholars], Research House for Asian Art, Peking University&lt;/ref&gt; who also serves on the Yuan Center's directorial board.

A leading exhibitor of contemporary [[Chinese art]], the Yuan Center is located near the center of Beijing, unlike the [[798 Art Zone]] in outlying [[Dashanzi]].
