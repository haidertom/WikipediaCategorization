'''Alejandro de Tomaso''' (July 10, 1928 in [[Buenos Aires]] – May 21, 2003 in [[Modena]], [[Italy]]) was a [[racing driver]] and businessman from [[Argentina]]. His name is sometimes seen in an Italianised form as ''Alessandro de Tomaso''. He participated in two [[Formula One]] World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on January 13, 1957. He scored no championship points. He later founded the Italian sports car company [[De Tomaso|De Tomaso Automobili]] in 1959.

==De Tomaso the carmaker==

Born in [[Argentina]] in a politically prominent family, de Tomaso fled to Italy in 1955 – from where his paternal grandfather had emigrated – in his late twenties, after being implicated in a plot to overthrow the [[Argentina|Argentinian]] president, [[Juan Perón]].&lt;ref name=Motor197107&gt;{{cite magazine| authorlink =Pete Coltrin (Charles Bulmer - ed)| title =The Italian Dream|magazine= [[The Motor|Motor]]| volume = | pages =18–20|date = 10 July 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; He settled in [[Modena]], where he married Elizabeth Haskell, an [[United States|American]] heiress (upon their marriage, she "Italianised" her first name to Isabella, just as Alejandro became Alessandro), and started a career in the car industry as a racing driver for [[Maserati in motorsport|Maserati]], [[Scuderia Centro Sud]] and [[O.S.C.A.]]. He participated to four Formula One Grand Prix and scored no championship points.

In 1959 he founded the [[De Tomaso]] car company in [[Modena]], originally to build prototypes and racing cars, including a [[Formula One]] car for [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]]' team in 1970. De Tomaso then turned to high-performance sports cars, most of which used [[aluminium]] backbone [[chassis]], which were to become the company's technical trademark. [[De Tomaso]] cars include the two-door, mid-engined [[De Tomaso Vallelunga|Vallelunga]], [[De Tomaso Mangusta|Mangusta]] and [[De Tomaso Pantera|Pantera]]; the [[De Tomaso Deauville|Deauville]], a four-door saloon resembling the [[Jaguar XJ6]]; and the [[De Tomaso Longchamp|Longchamp]], a two-door coupé version of the [[De Tomaso Deauville|Deauville]] which later formed the basis of the [[Maserati in motorsport|Maserati]] [[Maserati Kyalami|Kyalami]]. [[De Tomaso]]'s most recent product has been the [[De Tomaso Guarà|Guarà]], a two-door sports car with a [[carbon fibre]] bodyshell.

During the 1960s and 1970s, de Tomaso acquired a number of Italian industrial holdings. As well as the [[Ghia]] and [[Vignale]] coachbuilding studios, he earned control of the [[Benelli (motorcycles)|Benelli]] and [[Moto Guzzi]] motorcycle firms, the [[Innocenti]] car company (founded as an offshoot of the [[British Motor Corporation]] to build [[Mini]]s in [[Italy]]), and, in 1975, the celebrated sports car maker [[Maserati]], which he rescued from bankruptcy with the assistance of the Italian government. Over time, however, he sold many of his holdings; [[Ghia]] was sold to [[Ford]] (who would make much use of the name) in 1973; [[Innocenti]] and [[Maserati in motorsport|Maserati]] were sold to [[Fiat]] (which closed the former) in 1993.

In 1993 De Tomaso suffered a stroke and the day-to-day running of the [[De Tomaso]] company passed to his son Santiago.

He helped in the engineering of the sports version of the fourth generation [[Daihatsu Charade]], introduced in 1994, which was known as the Daihatsu Charade De Tomaso.

Alejandro de Tomaso died in Italy in 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2198">A '''balanced job complex''' is a way of organizing a workplace or group that is both directly democratic and also creates relative equal [[empowerment]] among all people involved.

Specifically a balanced job complex is a collection of tasks within a given workplace that is balanced for its equity and empowerment implications against all other job complexes in that workplace. It was developed as an alternative to the corporate division of labor.

Each worker must do a share of rote tasks (unskilled work) for some time each work day or each week. All workers also share the most rewarding and empowering tasks in the workplace so it is coordinated with everyone's involvement. In this way workers share the burdens and benefits of work that impact each person's ability to participate in democratic decision-making within the workplace.

Balanced job complexes imply a lack of owners or formal managers involved in the workplace, as all tasks are balanced for empowerment.

Balanced job complexes are central to the theory of [[participatory economics]] which emerged from the work of radical theorist [[Michael Albert]] and that of radical economist [[Robin Hahnel]].

The concept of the balanced job complex was developed and put into practice at [[South End Press]] in the late 1970s.

In the 1990s, a series of worker-run collectives in [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Manitoba]], Canada, were founded using parecon-inspired principles, including balanced job complexes, as part of their internal structures.  Most notable{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} in this regard have been [[Mondragon Bookstore]] and Coffee House, [[G7 Welcoming Committee Records]], and [[Arbeiter Ring Publishing]].

[[File:The Sample of the Certificate.jpg|thumb|right|Sample certificate]]

{{See also|Type approval}}
In Russia, a '''Certificate of Conformity''', also called a Quality Certificate, Safety Certificate or Customs Certificate, affirms that a product or service conforms to legal safety and quality requirements. There are two types of certificate: one demonstrates conformity to the national standards known as [[GOST]], and the other to a particular technical regulation. Certification may take place on either a mandatory or a voluntary basis. The certificate may be obtained: under contract; per consignment; or for serial production of commercial products.

== Types ==
There are two types of Conformity Certificate in Russia: the [[GOST]] Certificate of Conformity to National Standards, and the Certificate of Conformity to a Technical Regulation. The explanation of this is that the Technical Regulations began to be developed and enforced only recently, and do not yet fully regulate the certification process in Russia. Until the Technical Regulations replace the GOST Standards, the latter continue to play a part in the certification process on the Russian territory. It should also mentioned proving correspondence to Technical Conditions (TC),{{clarify|date=October 2016}} but generally this method is used in voluntary certification.

== Mandatory and voluntary certification ==
Manufacturers may obtain the Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation in mandatory or voluntary form.  In voluntary certification it is the manufacturer who chooses the parameters on which to certificate. That is the reason why voluntary certification is used by large manufacturers and trade representatives for proving the correspondence of their product to the technical requirements, as well as to additional GOST standards which are not used in obligatory certification.

== Period of validity ==
The Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation may be given only by an authorized organ in the sphere of certification. The document may be given for the period of 1, 2 or 3 years in the case of series production. If the certificate is given for the party of the products, its term is unlimited. Such type of certification is typical for the parties of foreign products that are delivered into the [[Russian Federation|Russian]] territory according invoice or a contract.

== The schemes of certification ==
The certificate may be obtained: under contract; per consignment; or for serial production of commercial products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intergost.com/sertifikat-sootvetstviya-gost-r/ Certificate of Conformity], InterGost&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scheme 1 ===
Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation may be drawn up according to the contract. In this case the certificate must contain the date and details of product tests (the date and the number of the testing protocol). The certificate of this type generally includes the correct name of the Certificate Receiver and the Product Manufacturer, the date and the number of the contract and the scheme of certification. Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation is generally drawn up in the case when the import is not limited to a one-time delivery of the products. After drawing up such a document the applicant may import their product for a period of one year.

=== Scheme 2 ===
{{clarify section|date=October 2016}}
The Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation may be drawn up for the party of products. In such case there is no need in drawing up the testing protocol, but the certificate must include the date and the number of invoice. Such kind of certificates is drawn up when importing the test party of some type of product because it is valid only for a limited party of goods. The Correspondence Certificate is provided with the open date. Generally, this kind of certificate is given, for example, for equipment.

=== Scheme 3 ===
Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation for the serial output of production may be drawn up only after certification tests. It is valid from one to three years. This kind of document may be drawn up by both Russian and foreign manufacturers.

== Process for obtaining the Certificate ==
It is possible to receive the Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation after providing the documents package to the certification center. One of the necessary documents required for certification is the test protocol. The document may be given by any laboratory authorized for certification tests after testing the products for correspondence to legislative requirements. Generally certification laboratories check the products for environmental and consumer safety as well as they correspond to the claimed characteristics mentioned in technical documentation to the real characteristics.{{clarify|date=October 2016}}

=== Documents needed for the certification process ===

* The documents proving the property or lending of the manufacturing premises;

The '''Chartered Institute of Management Accountants''' ('''CIMA''') is a UK based professional body offering training and qualification in [[Management accounting|management accountancy]] and related subjects. It is focused on accountants working in industry, and provides ongoing support and training for members.

CIMA is one of the [[British qualified accountants|professional associations for accountants]] in the UK and Ireland. Its particular emphasis is on developing the management accounting profession. CIMA is the largest management accounting body in the world with 281,467 students and CGMAs 106,095 of which are members in 2017.&lt;sup&gt;[http://2016.cimaglobal.com/ &lt;nowiki&gt;[1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; CIMA is also a member of the [[International Federation of Accountants]].

== History ==

CIMA, was formed in March 1919, as the Institute of Cost and Works Accountant, by a group of legal professionals and businessmen who wanted to develop an approach to accounting that would meet the demands of a rapidly changing business world. Industrialisation had led to large scale, complex businesses providing unprecedented challenges in management. Employers needed a new form of in-house accountant to provide, in addition to accounts, better analysis of cost and of operations to inform performance management. The new institute soon gained the backing of leading industrialists including, Lord Leverhulme who became its president.

Advances in technology and globalisation made business ever more complex over the 20th century and the role of the accountant in business became more significant. It expanded to include provision of a wider range of information and the emphasis shifted from accounting to management. 

The status of management accounting as a distinct branch of the accounting profession was recognised by the granting of a Royal Charter in 1975. 

== Activities ==
CIMA operates a standard scheme of qualifying examinations for prospective members. It promotes local education, training and management development operations, and new techniques through its research foundation and the dissemination of management accounting practices through publications and other media related activities. CIMA has been active in recent educational and vocational initiatives in former [[Eastern bloc]] countries. It publishes a monthly journal, supplied free to members and registered students, called 'Financial Management'.

CIMA is recognised as a professional accounting body for various statutory purposes by UK and various overseas governments. The institute regulates the activities of its members by a code of practice, a discipline committee and a continuing professional development education scheme. Its governing body is its council, comprising members elected from regional branches. Each of the branches has a committee and is responsible for much of the '[[grass roots]]' activity. Activity such as qualification development is undertaken from the London head office.

In 2011 CIMA left CCAB. &lt;http://www.cimaglobal.com/Pages-that-we-will-need-to-bring-back/Old-site-pages1/Old-site-pages/About-us/Press-office/Press-releases/2011/March-2011/CIMA-withdraws-from-the-CCAB/&gt;

In 2012, CIMA and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants created the CGMA® designation (Chartered Global Management Accountant). The designation recognises the most talented and committed management accountants with the discipline and skill to drive strong business performance. The CGMA is the most widely held management accounting designation in the world with more than 150,000 designees it is educationally equivalent to a master’s degree. The designation is built on extensive global research to maintain the highest relevance with employers and develop the competencies most in demand. CGMA® professionals are business strategists who can link the board’s objectives and the rest of your organisation, guiding critical business decisions and creating sustainable business success.  

In 2014 CIMA, with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, launched the Global Management Accounting Principles (Principles). The Principles were endorsed by UK business leaders including: Mr Ian king Chief Executive, BAE Systems and Howard Orme, Director General, Finance &amp; Commercial, Department for Business Innovation &amp; Skills. [https://www.ft.com/content/0b595a98-59fa-11e4-8771-00144feab7de#axzz3uNsFcN5U www.ft.com]. The [https://www.cgma.org/resources/tools/cgma-competency-framework.html CGMA Competency Framework] was also launched in 2014. The framework shows the range of technical, accounting and finance skills that management accountants need to do their jobs and consists of four knowledge areas: Technical Skills, Business Skills, People Skills and Leadership Skills all underpinned by Ethics, Integrity and Professionalism.

In 2016 CIMA, sponsored the creation of the world’s first management accounting standard: [https://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail?pid=000000000030325357 PAS 1919:2016 Guide to management accounting principles]. The standard, published by the British Standards Institute codifies a universal framework for best practice in decision making. Organisations including, Sky, The EnvironmentAgency, Fujitsu, the NHS and Siemens had input into its development. It is designed as a best-practice guide to management accounting, allowing organisations to benchmark their finance function and to unlock the full contribution that management accountancy can make. The specification is based on the [https://www.cgma.org/content/dam/cgma/resources/reports/downloadabledocuments/global-management-accounting-principles.pdf Global Management Accounting Principles], created in 2014 by CIMA and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 

In 2017, members of CIMA and AICPA formed the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants to unite and strengthen the accounting profession globally. Representing an influential network of more than 667,000 members and students in management and public accounting, the Association prepares accountants for today’s challenges and tomorrow’s opportunities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10984">'''Chayben Abou-Nehra''' (1974 – 21 December 2008), also referred to as '''Ben Bou-Nahra''', was a [[Belize]]an businessman. He had a variety of business activities, including as a 10% shareholder in [[Miles Tropical Energy]], which had various petroleum concessions off the coast near [[Dangriga]].&lt;ref name="Amandala20110218"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=10907|first=Adele|last=Ramos|title=Front men, or partners in petroleum?|work=[[Amandala]]|date=2011-02-18|accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a controversial figure both in life and in death. Charged with manslaughter after killing a man in September 2005, he absented himself from Belize at a time when the charges were upgraded to murder, returned when the charges were downgraded to manslaughter, and then walked free in 2007 when witnesses against him refused to testify. Late the following year he was found dead in his hotel room of a gunshot wound, in what may have been a suicide.&lt;ref name="Amandala20081223"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=7925|first=Rowland A.|last=Parks|title=Abou-Nehra shot dead – post-mortem controversy|work=[[Amandala]]|date=2008-12-23|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of Shawn Copious==

===Shooting and charges===
On 17 September 2005 at roughly 3:30 AM, Abou-Nehra returned to his home in King's Park, [[Belize City]] to find 23-year-old Shawn Copious in his yard.&lt;ref name="News520050915"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/10734|title=Suspected burglar shot dead by King’s Park resident|work=News 5 Belize|date=2005-09-19|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abou-Nehra claims Copious advanced on him in a threatening manner. Abou-Nehra had a licensed [[9mm caliber|9mm]] pistol on his person, which he drew and fired at Copious six times, killing him. Police found a large meat [[cleaver (knife)|cleaver]] on Copious' person. Copious had previously had numerous run-ins with the law, with a conviction for theft and at the time of his death also standing trial for charges of [[handling stolen goods]]. Abou-Nehra had earlier that year been accused of shooting a man at [[BTL Park]], but no charges were filed in that incident.&lt;ref name="News720050919"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=2221&amp;frmsrch=1|title=Intruder Killed by Businessman; Was it Justified?|work=7 News Belize|date=2005-09-19|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copious' stepfather Lawrence Mejia spoke with Abou-Nehra after Copious' death, and described him as "a really good man" who showed remorse for the killing and offered what help he could to the family, but expressed confusion that his stepson's injuries were not just limited to a gunshot wound but also consisted of broken teeth, hands, and nose.&lt;ref name="News520050915"/&gt;  Abou-Nehra offered [[Belizean dollar|BZ$]]3,000 to Copious' mother Caroline Copious to pay the burial expenses.&lt;ref name="News720050919"/&gt;

Police held Abou-Nehra for 48 hours, but at the time regarded the killing as a [[justifiable homicide|justifiable]] [[use of force]] and did not file charges. However, in July 2006 police charged him with manslaughter; he was represented by attorneys Kareem Musa and Ellis Arnold in his first court appearance, at which his bail was set at BZ$10,000 and he was given a September court date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=4287&amp;frmsrch=1|title=Ben Abou-Nahra Charged for Killing Shawn Copious|work=7 News Belize|date=2006-07-24|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more detail about the circumstances of Copious' death came to light, specifically the fact that he had been shot in the back from five feet away, then-Senior Crown Counsel [[Cheryl-Lynn Vidal|Cheryl-Lynn Branker-Taitt]] wrote to Criminal Investigations Bureau chief [[Chester Williams (police officer)|Chester Williams]] to recommend that Abou-Nehra be charged with murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=8993|title=DPP Kirk Anderson Wanted To Charge Ben Bou-Nehra For Murder|work=7 News Belize|date=2007-10-26|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2006, [[Director of Public Prosecutions (Belize)|Director of Public Prosecutions]] [[Kirk Anderson (lawyer)|Kirk Anderson]] instructed Commissioner of Polize [[Gerald Westby]] to charge Abou-Nehra with murder.&lt;ref name="Amandala20070515"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=5654|first=Anita|last=Nembhard|title=Chayben Abou-Nehra indicted for manslaughter in death of Shawn Copius|work=[[Amandala]]|date=2007-05-15|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at that time Abou-Nehra had already departed Belize, according to his attorney [[Dickie Bradley]] for purposes of receiving medical care.&lt;ref name="Amandala20070508"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=1403&amp;frmsrch=1|title=Abou-Nehra Murder Charge Dropped to Manslaughter|date=2007-05-08|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then failed to show up for his [[arraignment]] hearing in January 2007, at which the complaint of murder was supposed to have been read. A note purporting to be from a doctor in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] stated that Abou-Nehra was medically incapable of travelling. In May 2007, he was finally indicted on charges of manslaughter rather than murder. He came before Judge [[Troadio Gonzalez]], who ordered that the case be traversed to the following month's court session due to the large backlog of defendants with charges even older than Abou-Nehra's. His bail was set at BZ$10,000.&lt;ref name="Amandala20070515"/&gt;

===Walks free due to police refusal to testify===
After Anderson stepped down, the new DPP [[Lutchman Sooknandan]] reduced Abou-Nehra's charges back to manslaughter.&lt;ref name="Amandala20070515"/&gt; In July, Sooknandan had to issue a declaration of ''[[nolle prosequi]]'' because the [[crown counsel]] assigned to the case, Cecil Ramirez, had been suspended from practicing law in 2002 and 2003, leading to a question of whether he could legally work for the Office of the DPP. However, Sooknandan said that Abou-Nehra could be re-arrested on the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=7422&amp;frmsrch=1|title=DPP Withdraws Manslaughter Charge Against Abou-Nehra|work=7 News Belize|date=2007-07-24|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abou-Nehra came to trial on manslaughter charges again in October. However, three police officers called as witnesses claimed they could not identify him, and the signed record of the caution statement given to Abou-Nehra went missing. Justice [[Adolph Lucas]] had no choice but to [[jury instructions|direct the jury]] to find Abou-Nehra not guilty of manslaughter. He berated the witnesses as "worthless and wicked", while Sooknandan described the police's conduct as creating "the most shameful miscarriage of justice" he had ever seen. Belizean law prohibits [[double jeopardy]], meaning that there was no possibility of a further trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=7903&amp;frmsrch=1|title=DPP Defends Handling of Abou-Nehra Case|work=7 News Belize|date=2007-07-31|accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=6195|first=Anita|last=Nembhard|title='Worthless and wicked!'|work=[[Amandala]]|date=2007-10-26|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, two of the witnesses Darius Ramos and Anthony Poloni, both constables, were charged with perjury and contradicting previous evidence; they pleaded not guilty. The DPP declined to charge the third witness, former Inspector Clement Cacho, who by then had been demoted to sergeant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=6216|first=Anita|last=Nembhard|title=Constables Darius Ramos, 46, and Anthony Polonio, 45, charged in Chay Abou-Nehra acquittal|work=[[Amandala]]|date=2007-10-30|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; An internal police tribunal later found that Ramos, Polonio, and Cacho had committed an "Act to the Prejudice of Good Order and Discipline against the Department".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sanpedrodaily.com/1-24-08.html|title=Police panel finds three forgetful cops guilty|work=San Pedro Daily|date=2008-01-24|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cacho was reduced in rank and given half-pay, but later filed suit in the [[Supreme Court of Belize|Supreme Court]] against the police department and in 2010 was awarded reinstatement and back pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=17656|title=Clement Cacho Is Back|work=7 News Belize|date=2010-08-25|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In 2008, Abou-Nehra was on holiday up country in [[Cayo District]] with his fiancée, 22-year-old Evita Bedran, the granddaughter of late hotel magnate [[Escander Bedran]].&lt;ref name="Amandala20081223"/&gt; They went to a disco in [[Benque Viejo del Carmen]] a few miles away, where he got into an altercation.&lt;ref name="Amandala20081223"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/2991|title=Ben Bou-Nahra dead: Murder or Suicide?|work=News 5 Belize|date=2008-12-22|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; His shirt stained with blood, he then returned with Bedran to [[San Ignacio (town)|San Ignacio town]] and went to their hotel, the [[San Ignacio Resort Hotel]] owned by Bedran's family, in order to get a new set of clothes.&lt;ref name="Amandala20081223"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=12935|title=Ben Bou-Nahra Killed with a Bullet to the Head. Suicide or Homicide?|work=7 News Belize|date=2008-12-23|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After changing, he got into another altercation, this time with a security guard at the hotel. Another security guard attempted to calm the two, and got himself [[Pistol-whipping|pistol-whipped]] by Abou-Nehra for his trouble, receiving a laceration to the head requiring four stitches. The two security guards filed a police report against Abou-Nehra, while Abou-Nehra himself returned to his room. By the time police arrived at the hotel, Abou-Nehra was laid out on the floor of his hotel room with a gunshot wound.&lt;ref name="Amandala20081223"/&gt;

Abou-Nehra was taken first to San Ignacio's [[Loma Luz Hospital]], and then [[Belize City]]'s [[Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital]], where he was declared dead at 7 AM the following morning. His family expressed suspicion that he would have committed suicide, and requested to have their own [[forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] observe the autopsy at KNMH. Pathologist [[Mario Estradaban]] declined comment.&lt;ref name="Amandala20081223"/&gt; He was survived by a daughter Madison, as well as his mother Maria and sister Rachelle.&lt;ref name="Amandala20110218"/&gt;

It is a new measurement of crony capitalism designed by ''[[The Economist]]'' newspaper based on the "work by Ruchir Sharma of [[Morgan Stanley]] Investment Management, Aditi Gandhi and Michael Walton oew Delhi's [[Centre for Policy Research]], and others" in 2014.&lt;ref name=index&gt;{{cite web|title=Our crony-capitalism index: Planet Plutocrat |url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21599041-countries-where-politically-connected-businessmen-are-most-likely-prosper-planet |publisher=The Economist|accessdate=20 March 2014|author=The Economist|authorlink=The Economist|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
The index aims to be a measuring trend in the number of economic [[rent-seeking|rent-seekers]]. The assumption behind is because of the favorable political policies set by the government officials, the [[:en:tycoon|tycoons]] are increasing their wealth and interest. As a result, they get a larger part of people’s fruits of labor, instead of generating more wealth for the whole society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More pragmatism needed over Hong Kong's land policy |url=http://www.scmp.com/business/article/1451158/more-pragmatism-needed-over-hong-kongs-land-policy |publisher=South China Morning Post|accessdate=24 March 2014|author=Howard Inn|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some extreme cases, some favored suppliers are influential on the establishment and application of the business-impacting laws and citizens pay the tax for purchasing the overpriced products supplied by the favored corporations.

==Methodology==
Ten of the industries that are susceptible to [[monopoly]] or require licensing or highly depend on the government have been selected: casinos; coal, palm oil and timber; defense; deposit-taking banking and investment banking; infrastructure and pipelines; ports; airports; real estate and construction; steel and other metals; mining and commodities; utilities and telecoms services. Then, the total wealth of world’s billionaires who actively involve in rent-heavy industries from the data of [[Forbes]] will be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Billionaires |url=https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/list/#tab:overall |work=Forbes|authorlink=Forbes|accessdate=28 March 2014|author=Forbes|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results can be achieved from the ratio of billionaire wealth to [[GDP]] in their own countries; higher ratio of billionaire wealth to [[GDP]] indicates higher possibility of suffering from [[crony capitalism]].

==Result==
===2016===
The 2016 index was published on May 7, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/international/21698239-across-world-politically-connected-tycoons-are-feeling-squeeze-party-winds The party winds down].India is ranked at ninth position in crony-capitalism with crony sector wealth accounting for 3.4 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP), according to a new study by The Economist. 

In India, the non-crony sector wealth amounts to 8.3 per cent of the GDP, as per the latest crony-capitalism index. 

In 2014 ranking also, India stood at the ninth place.

==Limitations==

===Concealing fortunes===
The phenomenon of concealing fortunes is common for cronies, especially in [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China's Elite Wealth in Offshore Tax Havens, Leaked Files Show |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-22/chinas-elite-wealth-in-offshore-tax-havens-show-leaked-files |work=BloombergBusinessweek|accessdate=30 March 2014|author= Dexter Roberts|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been revealed that some of the powerful politicians have disguised their properties by transferring it under the names of their friends and family members. Unreliable property records are also believed to be the obstacles of determining an individual’s actual wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Putin the Perónist |url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/nina-l--khrushcheva-examines-the-affinities-between-russia-s-leader-and-argentina-s-post-war-strongman |work=Project Syndicate |accessdate=30 March 2014|author=Nina L. Khrushcheva |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the cronies are not willing to announce their wealth publicly has affected the accuracy of the index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Economist’s Crony Capitalism Index Does Not Measure Crony Capitalism |url=http://globalanticorruptionblog.com/2014/03/31/the-economists-crony-capitalism-index-does-not-measure-crony-capitalism/ |work=The Global Anticorruption Blog |accessdate=30 March 2014|author=Eden Schiffmann|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rough categorization===
''[[The Economist]]'' roughly categorizes the industrial sectors with neglected critical instances of cronyism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Politicians’ Extortion Racket |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/opinion/politicians-extortion-racket.html?_r=0 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=1 April 2014|author= Peter Schweizer|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Limited data of crony===
The index has only counted the wealth of billionaires which contributed to the omission of extensive data. Due to the lack of data, particular industries in a certain country cannot be exactly identified as "crony heavy". A group of cronies can also possibly be enriched by plenty of rent-seeking while not wealthy enough to achieve the cut-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fighting corruption in India: A bad boom |url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21598967-graft-india-damaging-economy-country-needs-get-serious-about-dealing-it |work=The Economist|accessdate=29 March 2014|author=The Economist|authorlink=The Economist|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this group will not be examined in the index. The index is only a crude guide to the concentration of wealth in opaque industries compared with more competitive ones.

==="Good governance" factor===
Public opinion has been weighted heavily when determining which governments are better.&lt;ref name=limit/&gt; Political consultant Nick Sorrentino wrote that ''The Economist'' "was afraid to go completely down the (anti) cronyism path because if one really examines cronyism it is tied in deeply with modern government".&lt;ref name=limit/&gt; Certain kinds of cronyism that involved fewer of the top social classes, such as the [[military-industrial complex]] in the United States, fail to be reflected in the index, which diminishes its accuracy.&lt;ref name=limit/&gt;

'''Hyperconsumerism''', '''hyper-consumerism''', '''hyperconsumption''' or '''hyper-consumption''' refer to the consumption of goods for non-functional purposes&lt;ref name="Sirgy2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Joseph Sirgy|title=Handbook of Quality-of-Life Research: An Ethical Marketing Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxEHYNDzGO0C&amp;pg=PA140|accessdate=6 February 2013|date=30 November 2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-0172-7|pages=140–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the associated significant pressure to consume those goods exerted by the modern, [[capitalist]] society, as those goods shape one's [[Identity (social science)|identity]].&lt;ref name="Städtler2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tierney2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Tierney|title=Key Perspectives in Criminology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-u1NoSEEJR4C&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=6 February 2013|date=1 May 2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill International|isbn=978-0-335-22914-7|pages=124–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frenchy Lunning]] defines it curtly as "a [[consumerism]] for the sake of consuming."&lt;ref name="Lunning2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frenchy Lunning|title=Fanthropologies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5d0Q9fdinQUC&amp;pg=PA140|accessdate=6 February 2013|date=9 November 2010|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-7387-2|pages=140–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
In a hyper-consumption society, "each social experience is mediated by market mechanisms", as market exchanges have spread to institutions in which they played lesser (if any) role previously, such as universities.&lt;ref name="GabrielLang2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yiannis Gabriel|author2=Tim Lang|title=The Unmanageable Consumer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NPA8OhyoHnAC&amp;pg=PA71|accessdate=6 February 2013|date=9 May 2006|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-1893-0|pages=71–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BondebjergGolding2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ib Bondebjerg|author2=Peter Golding|title=European Culture And The Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FJ9p6ms74AsC&amp;pg=PT74|accessdate=6 February 2013|year=2004|publisher=Intellect Books|isbn=978-1-84150-111-6|pages=74–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal identity===

Hyperconsumerism is fueled by [[brands]], as people often form deep attachment to product brands, which affects people's identity, and which pressure people to buy and consume their goods.&lt;ref name="Städtler2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Raphael Städtler|title=Celebrity Scandals and their Impact on Brand Image: A Study among Young Consumers: A Theoretical and Empirical Investigation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geYcb_YZk4UC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=6 February 2013|date=19 April 2011|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-640-89715-5|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sayers2008"/&gt;

===Product lifecycle===

Another of the characteristics of hyperconsumerism is the constant pursuit of novelty, encouraging consumers to buy new and discard the old, seen particularly in [[fashion]], where the [[product lifecycle]] can be very short, measured sometimes in weeks only.&lt;ref name="BondebjergGolding2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Arnold|title=Ethical Marketing and The New Consumer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XgohhaXFMqcC&amp;pg=PT30|accessdate=6 February 2013|date=27 October 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-68546-4|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conspicuous consumption===

In hyperconsumerism, goods are often [[status symbols]], as individuals buy them not so much to use them, as to [[Conspicuous consumption|display them to others]], sending associated meanings (such as displaying wealth).&lt;ref name="Sirgy2001"/&gt; However, according to other theorists, the need to consume in hyper-consumption society is driven less by competition with others than by their own [[hedonistic]] pleasure.&lt;ref name="Paris2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Paris|title=Affluence, Mobility and Second Home Ownership|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rcnD5vXj-_AC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=6 February 2013|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-54891-5|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious characteristics===

Hyperconsumerism has been also said to have religious characteristics,&lt;ref name="Bhaskar2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roy Bhaskar|title=Interdisciplinarity and Climate Change: Transforming Knowledge and Practice for Our Global Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xE2Oa2wKQ0YC&amp;pg=PA240|accessdate=6 February 2013|date=25 January 2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-57387-0|pages=240–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been compared to a new religion which enshrines consumerism above all, with elements of religious life being replaced by consumerist life: (going to) churches replaced by (going to) shopping malls, saints replaced by celebrities, penance replaced by shopping sprees, desire for better life after death replaced by desire for better life in the present, and so on.&lt;ref name="Sayers2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Sayers|title=The Trouble With Paris: Following Jesus in a World of Plastic Promises|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2osXF-V9XhkC&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=6 February 2013|date=3 June 2008|publisher=Thomas Nelson Inc|isbn=978-1-4185-7460-4|pages=30–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Sayers notes that hyperconsumerism has [[commercialized]] many religious symbols, giving an example of religious symbols worn as jewelry by non-believers.&lt;ref name="Sayers2008"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Hyperconsumerism has been associated with [[cultural homogenization]], [[globalization]], [[Eurocentrism]], Eurocentric [[modernizations]], and consequently, the spread of [[Western culture]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA140|accessdate=6 February 2013|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been blamed for environmental problems owing to excessive use of limited resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Interview by Sophie Morris |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/green-living/think-you-love-shopping-its-the-marketing-scam-of-the-century-849922.html |title=Think you love shopping?

'''Ian Martin Dalziel''' (pronounced "Dee-ell") (born 21 June 1947) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] businessman and politician who served one term as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of the European Parliament]] from 1979 to 1984.&lt;ref name=mep&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/archive/alphaOrder/view.do?language=EN&amp;id=895 | title = Ian M. Dalziel | accessdate = 18 August 2010 | publisher = ''[[European Parliament]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalziel was educated at [[Stewart's Melville College|Daniel Stewart's College]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[St John's College, Cambridge]], studying as a postgraduate at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] and [[London Business School]]. He worked for Mullens &amp; Co from 1970, before moving to a management position at Manufacturers Hanover Ltd. In 1978 he was elected as a Conservative to [[London Borough of Richmond|Richmond-upon-Thames Council]] for [[Barnes, London|Barnes]] Ward.

His involvement in international business led him to seek election to the [[European Parliament]] at the first election in 1979, and he was unexpectedly elected for the [[Lothians (European Parliament constituency)|Lothians constituency]] which included his birthplace of [[Edinburgh]]. He stood down after one five-year term. due to pressure of business: in 1983 he had become the co-founder of Adam &amp; Company, a start-up private bank subsequently acquired by Royal Bank of Scotland, and following a merger, became chairman of Continental Assets Trust plc.

In 1989 Dalziel became a director of Lepercq-Amcur Fund NV, and he has chaired the board of C.S.I., Inc., since 1992. He was appointed to the board of Precision Systems Inc. in 1996. In 1998 he was a defendant in a dismissed class action suit by shareholders of Precision Systems.

'''Innovation Park''' at [[Pennsylvania State University]] is a [[business park|business]] and [[research park]] covering {{convert|118|acre|km2}} in [[State College, Pennsylvania]], adjacent to the Penn State campus near the junction of [[Interstate 99]] and [[U.S. Route 322 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 322]].

'''James Stuart Douglas Jr.''' (1867–1949), popularly known as '''Rawhide Jimmy''', was a Canadian-American businessman and mining executive.

==Early life==
Douglas was the son of [[James Douglas (businessman)|James Douglas]], a Canadian mining engineer and executive. Born in [[Quebec]], Jimmy Douglas grew up in [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania]], where his father managed the Chemical Copper Company. Douglas left home at 17 and moved west to [[Manitoba]], where he [[Dominion Lands Act|homesteaded]]. Suffering from [[asthma]], he moved to the [[Arizona Territory]], in the United States, in the hope that the drier climate might provide relief.

==Career==
After a year in Sulpher Springs Valley, where he cultivated [[garden strawberry|strawberries]], he moved to [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]] at his father's request to work as an [[Metallurgical assay|assayer]] for the [[Copper Queen Mine]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Paul Browder and Thomas G. Smith; ''Independent: A Biography of Lewis W. Douglas''; Alfred A. Knopf Co.; New York; 1986; p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892 Douglas moved to [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]] to work for the Commercial Mining Company, an affiliate of the [[Phelps Dodge]] mining company. Eight years later he was transferred to [[Sonora]], [[Mexico]], to manage the copper mine and smelter at [[Pilares, Sonora|Pilares]] and [[Nacozari, Sonora|Nacozari]]; and directed construction of a railroad from [[Douglas, Arizona]] to Nacozari. While at Pilares, he acquired his nickname, "Rawhide Jimmy", because of his technique of  using rawhide to protect the rollers on mining equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert V. Young (1964), quoting Lewis W. Douglas&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, he moved to [[Cananea]], [[Sonora]], to manage the copper operations there. His tenure was marked by riots and labor problems, which were endemic to the Cananea mines.

==Speculator==
[[File:Douglas Mansion.jpg|thumb|left|The Douglas Mansion in Jerome]]
In 1912, Douglas returned to central Arizona, where he took an option on the [[United Verde Extension]] (UVX) property, a speculative venture to find the down-faulted extension of the great "United Verde" ore body near [[Jerome, Arizona]]. In 1914, with funds near exhaustion, an exploration drift cut [[Bonanza (mining)|bonanza]] copper ore. The UVX became a profitable mine. During 1916 alone, the mine produced $10 million worth of copper, silver and gold, of which $7.4 million was profit.&lt;ref&gt;Arizona Bureau of Mines Bulletin #180; 1969; Mineral and Water Resources of Arizona; p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; The UVX paid $55 million in dividends during its life (1915–1938), making Douglas a wealthy man.

==Retirement and death==
In 1939, Douglas retired to Canada, where he died of heart failure in 1949.

==Legacy==
Douglas' Jerome mansion is open to the public as the [[Jerome State Historic Park]].

Douglas' son, [[Lewis W. Douglas]], who also entered the mining business, went on to a successful political career as a [[Member of Congress|Congressman]] from 1927–33; and the [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] (1947–51). The copper-roofed cottage on the hillside adjacent to the Douglas Mansion was built as a wedding present for Lewis.

'''Kamila Sidiqi''' is an Afghan entrepreneur, government official, and the subject of New York Times Bestseller ''[[The Dressmaker of Khair Khana]]''.

==Background==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2015}}
Sidiqi received her teaching certificate the same day the [[Taliban]] arrived in [[Kabul]], rendering her unable to work. Without any means of supporting her family, the then 19-year-old turned to dressmaking. With the help of her sisters, she opened a tailoring school in their home to teach women to sew and provide employment after their training was completed. The venture went on to employ nearly 100 of Sidiqi's neighbours without attracting the Taliban's attention.

==Career==
In 2004, following the fall of the Taliban, Sidiqi set up Kaweyan Business Development Services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kaweyan Business Development Services|url=http://kaweyanbds.com/|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to bring business and leadership skills to women and men in remote rural communities and cities. In her role as CEO, Sidiqi travelled across a country where few women could venture without a male relative to escort them, and where aid workers often travel with armed guards or local police. Her aim was to train rural communities in the basics of entrepreneurship. Kaweyan BDS was Afghanistan’s first business development company run by a woman. It trained 5,000 people (70 percent of them women) in business and leadership.

Since 2014, Sidiqi has been on the board of NGO Hand in Hand Afghanistan (a part of the [[Hand in Hand International]] network),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hand in Hand International|url=http://www.handinhandinternational.org|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; an NGO that helps the rural poor in Afghanistan to turn their skills and potential into jobs. She provides strategic direction to the organization, which has trained 22,000 micro-entrepreneurs (mostly women) who have gone on to create over 8,000 businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hand in Hand Afghanistan Results|url=http://handinhand.org.af/updated-results/|website=Hand in Hand Afghanistan website|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sidiqi is a founding member of Leading Entrepreneurs of Afghanistan Development(LEAD). She is also a member of a number of influential international women’s associations
including the  Steering Committee for the South Asia Women Entrepreneurs Symposium.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In October 2014, she became the Deputy Chief of Staff for the President's office at Government of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

'''Kompas Gramedia''' is the largest media [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] in [[Indonesia]].

== History ==
After the success of the magazine ''Intisari'' (released 17 August 1963), [[P. K. Ojong]] and [[Jakob Oetama]] launched a national newspaper called ''[[Kompas]]''. The newspaper's first issue was released on 28 June 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nadeak |first=Carry |title=P. K. Ojong dan Jakob Oetama: Membuka Isolasi Mencerdaskan Bangsa |url=http://www.gatra.com/2008-08-16/artikel.php?id=117471 |work=[[Gatra (magazine)|Gatra]] |date=14 August 2008 |language=Indonesian |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5quBqLFGK?url=http://www.gatra.com/2008-08-14/versi_cetak.php?id=117471 |archivedate= 1 July 2010 |issn=0853-1706 |accessdate=1 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their aim was to breach the huge gap in daily news and information that that was lacking at that time. ''Kompas'' has since become a large circulation newspaper with an audited circulation in 2005 of 600,000 copies a day. The KGG also operates the largest printing plants in Indonesia.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Kompas newspaper==
{{main|Kompas}}
Kompas began its first issue on 28 June 1965 and was based in Central Jakarta with a circulation of 4,800 copies. Since 1969, Kompas newspaper has dominated sales nationwide. In 2004, daily circulation reached 530,000 copies, its special Sunday edition even reaching 610,000 copies. Readership is expected to reach 2.25 million people in Indonesia.
Kompas Daily Print had an average circulation of 500,000 copies per day, reaching an average of 1,850,000 people per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kompas Gramedia|url=http://www.kompasgramedia.com/business/newspapers/kompas|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspaper is distributed to all parts of Indonesia. Kompas is not just the largest circulating printed media in Indonesia, but is also the largest circulating newspaper in southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nama Kompas Pemberian Bung Karno|url=http://lipsus.kompas.com/hut45/sejarahkompas|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since the introduction of the iPad, Kompas Newspaper was the first printed media in southeast Asia to make a digital newspaper version for the iPad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kompas is the first Daily Newspaper in Asia on the iPad|url=http://www.serioustec.com/index.php?q=node/78|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; But until early 2014, Kompas News Portal is still the second after Detik.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribunnews.com/metropolitan/2014/03/21/syukuran-ultah-ke-4-tribunnewscom-bismillah-tahun-ini-tiga-besar-newsportal-nasional |title=Bismillah, Tahun Ini Tiga Besar Newsportal Nasional |date=March 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MFA Incorporated''' is a Midwest-based regional agricultural [[Cooperative]] serving more than 45,000 farmer/owners in [[Missouri]] and adjacent states.

Founded on March 10, 1914, MFA (which once stood for Missouri Farmers Association) traces its beginnings to a one-room schoolhouse near Brunswick, Mo. In Newcomer School on March 10, 1914, seven farmers met to discuss an article by William Hirth. Hirth owned a magazine called the Missouri Farmer and Breeder. In his magazine, Hirth called for formation of farm clubs. Seven Brunswick-area farmers (Aaron Bachtel, Tom Penick, Will Heisel, George Heisel, Earl Smutz, John Kohl and Will Armstrong) met to discuss Hirth's article and soon placed the first cooperative order for 1,150 pounds of baler twine.

By banding together for economic strength, members of the Newcomers Schoolhouse Farm Club saved $400 in several group transactions. Hirth handled the orders free of charge.

From that meeting emerged a cooperative that grew to become the largest business enterprise in the state. By the 1920s, MFA represented 400 local cooperatives. William Hirth was MFA's first president, serving until his death in 1940. Fred V. Heinkel served as president from 1940 through 1979 and oversaw a period of tremendous growth in MFA memberships, income, and associated businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://shs.umsystem.edu/historicmissourians/name/h/heinkel/index.html|title = Frederick Victor Heinkel|date = |accessdate = 2014-05-30|website = Historic Missourians|publisher = The State Historical Society of Missouri|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heinkel was succeeded by Eric Thompson.

Today, it is based in [[Columbia, Missouri]].  The cooperative created independent companies to serve its members: [[MFA Oil]] in 1929 and [[Shelter Insurance]] in 1946.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2010">The '''[[NYSE]] Arca Tech 100 Index''' is a price-weighted [[stock market index|index]] composed of [[common stock]]s and [[American Depositary Receipt|ADRs]] of technology-related companies listed on US [[stock exchange]]s. The index is maintained by the [[New York Stock Exchange]], but includes stocks that trade on exchanges other than the NYSE. Companies from different industries that produce or deploy innovative technologies to conduct their business are considered for inclusion. Leading companies are selected from several industries, including computer hardware, software, semiconductors, telecommunications, electronics, aerospace and defense, health care equipment, and biotechnology. 

Modeled as a multi-industry technology index, the objective of the NYSE Arca Tech 100 Index is to provide a benchmark for measuring the performance of companies using technology innovation across a broad spectrum of industries. 

Unlike other indexes, whose historic returns date back only a few months or years, the NYSE Arca Tech 100 Index has been tracked since 1982, when it was initiated by the [[Pacific Exchange]]. It is one of the oldest technology indexes calculated.

'''Original sin''' is a term in [[economics]] literature, proposed by [[Barry Eichengreen]], [[Ricardo Hausmann]], and [[Ugo Panizza]] in a series of papers to refer to a situation in which "most countries are not able to borrow abroad in their domestic currency."&lt;ref&gt;Eichengreen, B., and Hausmann, R., (1999).

Mimeographed .&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is a reference to the concept of [[original sin]] in Christianity.

== Original sin hypothesis ==
The original sin hypothesis has undergone a series of changes since its introduction.

The original sin hypothesis was first defined as a situation "in which the domestic currency cannot be used to borrow abroad or to borrow long term even domestically" by Barry Eichengreen and Ricardo Hausmann in 1999. Based on their measure of original sin (shares of home currency-denominated bank [[loans]] and international [[Bond (finance)|bond]] debt), they showed that original sin was present in most of the [[developing economies]] and independent from histories of high [[inflation]] and [[currency depreciation]]. However, this early study left the causes of original sin as an open question.

In the second version of the original sin hypothesis, [[Barry Eichengreen]], [[Ricardo Hausmann]] and [[Ugo Panizza]] in 2002 discarded the domestic element of original sin and redefined (international) original sin as a situation in which most countries cannot borrow abroad in their own currency. They showed that almost all of the countries (except [[United States|US]], [[Euro area]], [[Japan]], [[UK]], and [[Switzerland]]) suffered from (international) original sin over time. Eichengreen, ''et al.'' concluded that weaknesses of national [[macroeconomic policies]] and institutions are not statistically related with original sin and found that the only statistically robust determinant of original sin was country size. Moreover, they claimed that international [[transaction costs]], [[network externalities]], and global [[capital market]] imperfections were the main reasons (which are beyond the control of an individual country) of the original sin. Hence, as a solution for the original sin problem, they proposed an international initiative and recommended development of a [[Currency basket|basket index of]] [[emerging-market]] currencies so that [[international financial institutions]] could issue debt denominated in this index until a liquid-market in this index had developed. Burger and Warnock (2003) suggested inclusion of information on domestic bond markets to account for the possibility that foreign investors were holding local-currency emerging market bonds to analyze the determinants of original sin. Using this expanded measure, they showed that emerging markets economies could develop local bond markets (in which they can borrow in domestic currency) and attract global investors with stronger institutions and credible domestic policies.&lt;ref&gt;Burger, J., and Warnock, F., (2003). [http://ideas.repec.org/p/fip/fedgif/755.html "Diversification, Original Sin, and International Bond Portfolios"], International Finance Discussion Papers. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.&lt;/ref&gt; Reinhart, Rogoff and Savastano (2003) criticized the suggested international solution for the original sin problem by claiming that the main problem of emerging market economies is to learn how to borrow ''less'' ([[Debt Intolerance|debt intolerance]]) rather than learn how to borrow ''more'' in their domestic currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reinhart |first=Carmen M. |first2=Kenneth S. |last2=Rogoff |first3=Miguel A. |last3=Savastano |title=Debt Intolerance |journal=Brookings Papers on Economic Activity |volume=34 |issue=2003-1 |year=2003 |pages=1–74 |doi= |url=https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/debt-intolerance/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In these two earlier versions of original sin hypothesis, Eichengreen, Hausmann and Panizza argued that in the presence of high levels of original sin, domestic investments will have a currency mismatch (projects that generate domestic currency will be financed with a foreign currency) so that macroeconomic and financial instability will be unavoidable. Hence, original sin and [[currency mismatch]] are used interchangeable in these early studies. Goldstein and Turner (2003) criticized this by showing that large output losses due to the currency mismatches during [[financial crises]] could not be attributed to original sin. Hence, they claimed that the original sin is not a sufficient condition for a [[currency mismatch]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, M., and Turner, P., (2003). "Currency Mismatching in Emerging Economies", paper presented at an Institute for International Economics seminar, August 14, Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their last version of their original sin hypothesis, Eichengreen, Hausmann and Panizza defined domestic component of original sin as the "inability to borrow domestically long-term at fixed rates in local currency" while keeping the definition of (international) original sin same.&lt;ref&gt;Eichengreen, B., and Hausmann, R., (2003). [http://www.econ.berkeley.edu/~eichengr/research/osroadaug21-03.pdf "Original Sin: The Road to Redemption"], unpublished paper&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eichengreen, B., Hausmann, R., and Panizza, U., (2003). [http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/rhausma/paper/mistery_march3.pdf "The Mystery of Original Sin"], unpublished paper&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EichengreenHausmannPanizza2007" /&gt; They reported that no country (having an original sin ratio higher than 0.75) with high domestic original sin had low international original sin suggesting that if a country could not persuade its own citizens to lend in local currency at long maturities, it could not convince foreigners to do the same. On the other hand, they reported that seven countries, among the 21 emerging countries included in their sample, had low domestic original sin but relatively high international original sin, suggesting that dominant use of local currency in domestic markets is not a sufficient condition for dominant use internationally.

== Measures of original sin ==
There are three different measures of original sin in economics literature. These measures are defined mathematically as one minus the fraction of own currency-denominated [[securities]] in the relevant total. Original sin measures range between 0 and 1. A high measure of original sin indicates that a country suffers from high level of original sin. Thus, a country that issues all of its securities in foreign currency would have an original sin measure of one, while a country that issues all of its securities in its domestic currency would have an original sin measure of zero.

=== OSIN1 ===
The first measure of original sin (OSIN1) is defined as one minus the ratio of the stock of international securities issued by a country in its own currency and the total stock of international securities issued by the country. As this measure tends to 1, the greater the original sin. This index suffers from two shortcomings. First, it is based solely on securities but no other debts. Second, it ignores the effect of other [[financial instruments]], e.g., [[Swaps (finance)|swaps]], which are widely used for hedging [[currency risk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jimonfin.2003.09.006| title = On the determinants of Original Sin: An empirical investigation| journal = Journal of International Money and Finance| volume = 22| issue = 7| pages = 957| year = 2003| last1 = Hausmann | first1 = R. | last2 = Panizza | first2 = U. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, M., and Turner, P., (2004). "[https://books.google.com/books?id=J7axGThpaQcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Controlling+Currency+Mismatches+in+Emerging+Markets&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ijUP3ws4rt&amp;sig=TwUA1ALBPpLVpGgjB15Q3n02S-c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YQeQS_ugIs7e8QaF2Z2oBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CA0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Controlling Currency Mismatches in Emerging Markets"], Institute for International Economics.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt; OSIN1_{i}=1-\frac{\text{Securities issued by country i in currency i}}{\text{Securities issued by country i}} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== OSIN2 ===
The second version of the original sin index (OSIN2) is based on two intermediate measures: INDEXA and OSIN3. Unlike OSIN1, INDEXA accounts for [[bank loan]]s in addition to bond debt and OSIN3 accounts for [[Swaps (finance)|swaps]]. Thus, OSIN2 has the advantage of wider coverage; however, it is a less precise measure of original sin because of data limitations of bank loans.

&lt;center&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; OSIN2_i=max(INDEXA_{i},OSIN3_i) &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where;

&lt;center&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;INDEXA_{i}={\text{Securities} + \text{loans issued by country i in major currencies} \over \text{Securities} + \text{loans issued by country i}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== OSIN3 ===
The last measure of the original sin is based on an intermediate index (INDEXB) which aims to capture the effects of the [[Swaps (finance)|swaps]] on original sin and is defined as

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;OSIN3_i=max(INDEXB_i,0)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where INDEXB is defined as one minus the ratio between international securities issued in a given currency and the amount of the international securities issued by the corresponding country.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;INDEXB_i=1-\frac{\text{Securities in currency i (regardless of the nationality of the issuer)}}{\text{Securities issued by country i}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

These measures of original sin suggest that the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Switzerland (financial centers), and Euroland countries are more successful in issuing their securities in their own domestic currencies relative to [[developing countries]]. Moreover, these measures indicate that the original sin is persistent over 1993-2001 period in all country groups.

== Determinants of original sin ==
Empirical studies mainly focus on a few parameters as being the determinants of the original sin: (i) the level of development, (ii) monetary [[credibility]], (iii) level of [[debt]] burden, (iv) the [[exchange rate]] regime, (v) slope of the [[yield curve]], and (vi) size of the investor base.

The first determinant is level of development; measured generally with [[GDP per capita]]. Empirical studies indicate that [[GDP per capita]] is significantly correlated with original sin. However, this result is not robust to inclusion of other [[regressor]]s (Hausmann and Panizza, 2003).

The second determinant of the original sin is monetary credibility. This is important for both domestic and international original sin. The monetary credibility is proxied usually by inflation. Generally, the ratio of [[domestic debt]] to total [[public debt]] is higher in countries with lower and less volatile inflation indicating that inflation can change the composition of public debt and make it riskier. Hausmann and Panizza (2003) find that monetary [[credibility]], as measured by lower [[inflation]] and the imposition of capital controls, are associated with lower domestic original sin in emerging economies. On the international side, their study shows that if the monetary and fiscal authorities are inflation prone, foreign investors will lend only in foreign currency, which is protected against [[inflation]] risk, or at short maturities, so that the interest rates can be adjusted quickly to any acceleration of [[inflation]].

The third determinant is the level of debt burden. High public indebtedness gives rise to an inability to service debt. Consequently, governments attempt to reduce debt service costs through [[inflation]], unexpected changes in [[interest rates]], explicit taxation, or outright [[Default (finance)|default]]. Such situations reduce their credibility. Therefore, governments will tend to have a shorter maturity debt composition to enhance credibility when the debt burden is high. Most commonly, the ability to service debt is proxied with an array of macroeconomic indicators including the ratios of the fiscal balance to [[GDP]], [[primary balance]] to [[GDP]], government debt to exports and [[government debt]] to GDP (Hausman et al.,2003 and Mehl et al.,2005).

The fourth determinant is the exchange rate regime. As indicated by Hausmann and Panizza (2003), countries with [[fixed exchange rate]] regime experience large volatility in their domestic-currency interest rate, while countries that have a [[floating exchange rate]] regime experience larger exchange rate volatility. This creates differences in the structures of borrowing. Empirical studies show that [[fixed exchange rate]] regime is the main reason of liability [[dollarization]]. Despite these common weaknesses, emerging and [[developing economies]] have been able to attract capital because they have often operated under fixed or [[pegged exchange rate]] regimes until the early 2000s.

The fifth attempt is the slope of the [[yield curve]]. In theory, and given the existence of term premiums, issuing [[short-term debt]] is cheaper than issuing long-term debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |last=Mehl |first=A. |last2=Reynaud |first2=J. |year=2005 |url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/ecb/ecbwps/20050560.html |title=The Determinants of Domestic Original Sin in Emerging Market Economies |work=European Central Bank Working Paper |volume=560 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[refinancing risk]] is higher for short-term debt and frequent refinancing implies a larger risk of financing with higher [[interest rates]]. Therefore, governments face a trade-off between cheaper funding costs, which tilts the duration towards short-term maturities and refinancing risk, which tilts the duration towards longer-term maturities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Fernando A. |last=Broner |first2=Guido |last2=Lorenzoni |first3=Sergio L. |last3=Schmukler |year=2013 |title=Why Do Emerging Economies Borrow Short Term? |journal=Journal of the European Economic Association |volume=11 |issue=Suppl. 1 |pages=67–100 |doi=10.1111/j.1542-4774.2012.01094.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, an upward-sloping yield curve is associated with higher long-term borrowing to meet investor demand and, hence, lower original sin.

Moreover, size of the [[investor]] base is another determinant of the domestic original sin. This concept actually indicates the level of financial development which is measured most of the time by a ratio of total domestic credits to [[GDP]]. Finally, a special care to the level of openness which is generally measured by total foreign [[trade]], should be taken into account.

The [[Republic of Panama]] is one of the oldest and best-known tax havens in [[the Caribbean]], as well as one of the most established in the region.&lt;ref name=Maverick&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maverick|first1=J. B.|title=Why Is Panama Considered a Tax Haven?|url=http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/093015/why-panama-considered-tax-haven.asp|accessdate=May 5, 2016|work=Investopedia|date=September 30, 2015|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panama has had a reputation for [[tax avoidance]] since the early [[20th century]], and Panama has been cited repeatedly in recent years as a jurisdiction which does not cooperate with international tax transparency initiatives.

Panama's offshore sector is intimately tied to the [[Panama canal]], which has made it a gateway and ''entrepôt'' for international trade.&lt;ref name="PanamaTJN" /&gt; There are strong similarities between Panama and other leading tax havens like Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai. On paper at least, Panama has the largest shipping fleet in the world, greater than those of the US and China combined, according to the [[Tax Justice Network]].

==Background (1910s–1970s)==
[[File:Panama Canal under construction, 1907.jpg|thumb|Construction work on the [[Gaillard Cut]] of the [[Panama Canal]], 1907]]
A 2014 investigation by journalist [[Ken Silverstein]] published in ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice Magazine]]'' explains how Panama came into being, with US help:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1903, the administration of Theodore Roosevelt created the country after bullying Colombia to hand over what was then the province of Panama. Roosevelt acted at the behest of various banking groups, among them [[J. P. Morgan &amp; Co.]], which was appointed as the country's official "fiscal agent".&lt;ref name=Silverstein /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An operation{{which|date=July 2016}} approved by the [[Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt|Roosevelt administration]] sought to foment armed rebellion, forcing Panama away from Colombia, then politically fragile. Roosevelt achieved this goal with the help of [[William Nelson Cromwell]], a well-connected US Republican lawyer and also legal counsel for JP Morgan's railroad interests. The administration's key objective was allegedly to install a pro-US Panamanian government that would secure US rights over the [[Panama Canal]].&lt;ref name="Diaz-Espino2014"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty]] resulted, establishing permanent U.S. rights to a [[Panama Canal Zone]] several miles wide, across the neck of the isthmus. Panama became independent from Colombia the same month, and the Panama Canal opened in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2013 academic study published by the Norwegian Center for Taxation, Panama's reputation as a [[tax haven]] began in the year 1919, when it began registering foreign ships in order to help [[Standard Oil]] avoid US taxes and regulations; other US ship owners followed, some seeking to avoid the higher wages and better working conditions imposed by US legislation such as the Seaman's Act and safety standards for sea vessels.&lt;ref&gt;

Within a few years, Panama extended its minimalist approach to taxation, regulation and financial disclosure requirements to the world of [[offshore finance]]. According to the study, "Wall Street interests helped Panama introduce lax company incorporation laws, which let anyone start tax-free, anonymous corporations, with few questions asked".&lt;ref name="Armando Jose Garcia Pires" /&gt;

==Background (1970s–present)==
For decades, offshore finance had a relatively modest profile in Panama, but it took off in the 1970s as world oil prices surged. During this time, the Republic of Panama passed legislation "entrenching corporate and individual financial secrecy".&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1982, partly attracted by business opportunities deriving from the Panama Canal and its free trade zone, more than 100 international banks had offices in Panama City.&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt;

According to ''[[Investopedia]]'': "Panama's offshore jurisdiction offers a wide array of excellent financial services, including offshore banking, the incorporation of offshore companies, registration of ships and the formation of Panama trusts and foundations."&lt;ref name=Maverick /&gt; In Panama, no taxes are imposed on offshore companies which engage in business solely outside of the jurisdiction; therefore, the companies which are incorporated in the Republic of Panama and the owners of these companies are exempt from [[corporate taxes]], [[withholding tax]]es, [[capital gains tax]], [[local taxes]], [[estate taxes]] and [[inheritance tax]]. However, businesses within Panama itself are permitted to conduct business there so long as the company pays its local taxes.&lt;ref name=Maverick /&gt;

Panama has been cited repeatedly in recent years by the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] of the [[United States]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) as a jurisdiction which does not cooperate with international tax transparency initiatives due to the legislation which regulates the country's offshore jurisdiction and financial services.&lt;ref&gt;Panama as a jurisdiction which does not cooperate with international tax transparency initiatives:

Alongside incorporation of IBCs, Panama is active in forming tax-evading foundations and trusts, insurance, and boat and shipping registration, according to the [[Tax Justice Network]].&lt;ref name="PanamaTJN" /&gt;

===Financial privacy===
[[File:Countries implicated in the Panama Papers.svg|thumb |325px |right |Countries with politicians, public officials or close associates implicated in the [[Panama Papers]] leak on April 15, 2016]]

An extensive amount of legislation currently exists in the Republic of Panama to protect corporate and financial privacy. However, organisations such as the [[Tax Justice Network]] and other [[advocacy groups]] and [[non-governmental organisations]] state that the main intention of these laws is financial secrecy, as opposed to privacy.&lt;ref&gt;

The names of [[shareholders]] of Panamanian corporations, trusts and foundations are still not required by law to be publicly registered. Panama has no [[exchange controls]]: this means that for individual clients of Panama's offshore banking, as well as for offshore business entities incorporated in Panama, there are no limits or reporting requirements on money transfers into or out of the country.&lt;ref name=Maverick /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt;

Panama also has very strict banking secrecy laws: for example, it is forbidden for Panamanian banks to share any information about offshore bank accounts or account holders, except under special circumstances instigated by the Panamanian authorities. Such regulation has made it difficult to investigate the true extent of the [[Panama Papers]] leak, as severe criminal penalties are enacted to individuals who breach confidentiality.&lt;ref name=Maverick /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt;

Despite this, Panama does not appear on the [[Tax Justice Network]]'s top ten list for financial secrecy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=View 2015 Results|url=http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/introduction/fsi-2015-results|website=Financial Secrecy Index|publisher=Tax Justice Network|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208055612/http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/introduction/fsi-2015-results|archivedate=2015-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Alex Cobham of Tax Justice Network saying "There is a double standard: many developed countries host or support jurisdictions where there is an absence of financial transparency".&lt;ref name="BBC top 10"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Seitz|first1=Max|title=Why the top 10 tax havens don't include Panama|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35998801|work=BBC Mundo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Manuel Noriega]], commander of the [[Panamanian Public Forces#The Panamanian Defense Forces|Panama Defence Forces]], took power in Panama in 1983, Silverstein said, Noriega essentially nationalised the money-laundering business; he partnered with the [[Medellín Cartel|Medellin drug cartel]] and gave it free rein to operate in the country."&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Silverstein&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], ''[[Private Eye]]'' used data collected from the [[Land Registry]] to create "an easily searchable online map ... of properties in England and Wales owned by offshore companies. It reveals for the first time the extent of the British property interests held by companies based in tax havens." Most of these properties are tax avoidance vehicles and in some cases also to conceal wealth of dubious origin."&lt;ref&gt;

A 2003 examination of tax havens by [[Jeffrey Robinson]] quotes a US Customs official as saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Panama] is filled with dishonest lawyers, dishonest bankers, dishonest company formation agents and dishonest companies registered there by those dishonest lawyers so that they can deposit dirty money into their dishonest banks. The [[Colon Free Trade Zone|Free Trade Zone]] is the black hole through which Panama has become one of the filthiest money laundering sinks in the world.&lt;ref name="ConversationPanama"&gt;

'''Peter Andre''' (born '''Peter James Andrea''',&lt;ref name="Now"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowmagazine.co.uk/tag/peter-andre|title=Peter Andre|work=[[NOW (UK magazine)|Now Magazine]]|accessdate=31 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 27 February 1973) is an English-Australian singer, songwriter, businessman, presenter, television personality and actor.

He gained popularity as a singer, best known for his singles "[[Mysterious Girl]]" and "[[Flava (song)|Flava]]". He is also known for appearing on the third series of ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)|I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]'', and the [[Strictly Come Dancing (series 13)|thirteenth series]] of ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', in which he was partnered with [[List of So You Think You Can Dance finalists (U.S. season 5)#Janette Manrara|Janette Manrara]].

During his time on ''I'm A Celebrity'', Andre developed an on-screen romantic relationship with fellow contestant [[Katie Price]]. Andre and Price got married two years after the show's finale; they had two children, and released the 2006 album ''[[A Whole New World (album)|A Whole New World]]'' together, before divorcing in 2009.

In 2009, Andre released the album ''[[Revelation (Peter Andre album)|Revelation]]'' with the single "[[Behind Closed Doors (Peter Andre song)|Behind Closed Doors]]", which reached No. 4 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. He followed it up with his sixth studio album ''[[Accelerate (Peter Andre album)|Accelerate]]'' in 2010.

==Early life and music career==
Peter Andre was born on 27 February 1973 in Harrow, London, and is of [[Greek Cypriot]] descent. In 1979, as a six-year-old, Andre and his family relocated to [[Sydney]] before settling on [[Australia]]'s [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] at nine years old.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/peter-andre-learning-love-again-4404618 Peter Andre on learning to love again after the death of his brother]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, 16-year-old Andre became a contestant on Australian [[talent show]] [[New Faces (Australian talent show)|New Faces]] and as a result was offered a recording contract for $146,000. During this time, Andre lived in a beachside apartment in [[Surfers Paradise, Queensland|Surfers Paradise]] and attended [[Benowa State High School]] on the Gold Coast.

In the early 90s, Andre established himself on the Australian music scene. In 1992, Andre released his debut single, "[[Drive Me Crazy (song)|Drive Me Crazy]]", which peaked at #72 on the Australian singles chart. However, his musical breakthrough occurred with his second single, "[[Gimme Little Sign]]", which peaked at #3 and lasted a total of 31 weeks on the Australian charts. In 1993, he received an [[ARIA Award]] for highest-selling Australian single of the year. Andre's second studio album was released on 30 September 1996, peaking to number 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. The album included the hit single "[[Mysterious Girl]]", which peaked at number 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. As a result, he returned to the UK in the mid-90s.

He was raised as a [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness]], but is now lapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/feb/07/peter-andre-my-family-values|title=Peter Andre: My family values|author=Nick McGrath|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/peter-andre-believes-he-has-a-guardian-angel-6361404.html |title=Peter Andre believes he has a guardian angel |date=26 October 2011 |work=Evening Standard |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093135/http://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/peter-andre-believes-he-has-a-guardian-angel-6361404.html |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
During their marriage, Andre and [[Katie Price]] launched the ''[[Katie &amp; Peter]]'' franchise on [[ITV2]] which documented their life together. The franchise included several [[fly-on-the-wall]] reality series which comprised ''When Jordan Met Peter'', ''Jordan &amp; Peter: Laid Bare'' and ''Jordan &amp; Peter: Marriage and Mayhem'' (2004–05); ''Katie &amp; Peter: The Next Chapter'', ''Katie &amp; Peter: The Baby Diaries'' and ''Katie &amp; Peter: Unleashed'' (2007); ''Katie &amp; Peter: Down Under''; and ''Katie &amp; Peter: African Adventures'' (2008); and ''Katie &amp; Peter: Stateside'' in 2009. Their 2009 separation resulted in their individual shows being recorded: ''Peter Andre: The Next Chapter'' continued on ITV2 until 2011, followed by ''Peter Andre: Here 2 Help'' (2011) and ''Peter Andre: My Life'' (2011–13).

In July 2010, Andre and [[Jason Manford]] were team captains on the [[ITV Network|ITV]] series ''[[Odd One In]]''.

In 2013, Andre was a guest judge on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] entertainment series ''[[Your Face Sounds Familiar (UK TV series)|Your Face Sounds Familiar]]''.

In 2013, he guest-presented five episodes of ''[[Sunday Scoop]]'' on ITV. Since 11 November 2013, Andre has presented ''[[60 Minute Makeover]]'', which has been re-branded as ''Peter Andre's 60 Minute Makeover''.

In 2014, Andre released the song "Kid" for the film ''[[Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman]]'' which is the lead single from his album ''[[Big Night (Peter Andre album)|Big Night]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tina Campbell |url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/04/14/peter-andre-announces-change-in-musical-direction-hes-going-swing-4698908/ |title=Peter Andre launches Pledge Music campaign and new swing music album &amp;#124; Metro News |publisher=Metro.co.uk |date=2014-04-14 |accessdate=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 October 2014, Andre co-hosted the [[ITVBe]] opener with [[Jamelia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/ep1week41/welcome-itvbe|title=Welcome to ITVBe|work="ITV Press Centre"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Andre became the new face to feature in supermarket [[Iceland (supermarket)|Iceland]]'s television commercials.

Andre starred in the ITV weekly show ''[[Give a Pet a Home]]'' which works alongside the [[RSPCA]] in Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a636701/julian-clary-peter-andre-kimberly-wyatt-for-itvs-give-a-pet-a-home.html#~p7ynUNBUbsPJwL|title=Julian Clary, Peter Andre, Kimberly Wyatt for ITV's Give a Pet a Home|work=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 2015, he was announced as a contestant for the [[Strictly Come Dancing (series 13)|thirteenth series]] of ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' which began in September 2015 in which he was partnered with [[List of So You Think You Can Dance finalists (U.S. season 5)#Janette Manrara|Janette Manrara]]. They went out just before the quarter final; on week 10, and therefore finished seventh place.

Andre began dating glamour model [[Katie Price]] after they met on reality show ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)|I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]'' in early 2004. The couple got engaged secretly in May of the same year but it wasn't announced publicly until months later. Andre married Price on 10 September 2005 in [[Highclere Castle]], [[Hampshire]].

'''Polishing''' is the process of creating a smooth and shiny surface by rubbing it or using a chemical action, leaving a surface with a significant [[specular reflection]] (still limited by the [[index of refraction]] of the material according to the [[Fresnel equations]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Polish|url=http://www.answers.com/polishing|accessdate=2008-01-04}}. {{Dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some materials (such as metals, glasses, black or transparent stones), polishing  is also able to reduce [[diffuse reflection]] to minimal values. When an unpolished surface is  magnified thousands of times, it usually looks like mountains and valleys. By repeated abrasion, those "mountains" are worn down until they are flat or just small "hills." The process of polishing with [[abrasive]]s starts with coarse ones and graduates to fine ones.

==Mechanical properties==
The strength of polished products is normally higher than their rougher counterpart owing to the removal of [[stress concentration]]s present in the rough surface. They take the form of corners and other defects which magnify the local stress beyond the inherent strength of the material. 

Polishing with very fine abrasive differs physically from coarser abrasion, in that material is removed on a molecular level, so that the rate is correlated to the boiling point rather than to the melting point of the material being polished.{{Citation needed|reason=Correlation to melting and boiling points are disputed in the literature.|date=November 2013}}

* [[Mass finishing]]
**[[Tumble finishing]]
**[[Vibratory finishing]]
* [[Sodablasting]]

'''Process specification''' is a generic term for the specification of a process. Its context is not unique to "business activity" but can be applied to any organizational activity.  

Within some structured methods, the capitalized term '''Process Specification''' refers to a description of the [[Procedure (term)|procedure]] to be followed by an actor within an elementary level business activity, as represented on a process model such as a [[dataflow diagram]] or [[IDEF0]] model. A common alias is minispec short for miniature specification. 

==Use in systems development==

The process specification defines what must be done in order to transform inputs into outputs. It is a detailed set of instructions outlining a business procedure that each elementary level business activity is expected to carry out. Process specifications are commonly included as an integral component of a requirements document in systems development. 

==Techniques==

There are a variety of approaches that can be used to produce a process specification including
*[[decision tables]]
*structured English (favored technique of most systems analysts)
*pre/post conditions
*[[use cases]], basic course or events/alternate paths in [[use cases]]
*[[flowcharts]].
*[[Nassi–Shneiderman diagram]]
*[[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[Activity diagram]] 

No matter what approach is used, it must communicate to system development designers, implementers and support professionals, as well as be verifiable by the stakeholders/end users.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3183">'''Product forecasting''' is the science of predicting the degree of success a new product will enjoy in the [[marketplace]].  To do this, the forecasting model must take into account such things as [[product awareness]], [[Distribution (business)|distribution]], [[price]], fulfilling unmet needs and competitive alternatives.

==Bass model==
Bass model is one type of forecasting method primarily used in new product forecasting. In general, there will be no historical demand for new product. Then, Bass model tries to capture shape of demand of existing product and apply new product.
{{main|Bass diffusion model}}

&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)} = p + \frac{q}{m} N(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where,
* F(t) is the probability of adoption at time t
* f(t) is the rate at which adoption is changing with respect to t
* N(t) is the number of adopters at time t
* m is the total number of consumers who will eventually adopt
* p is the coefficient of innovation
* q is the coefficient of imitation

Multivariate techniques such as regression can be used to determine the values of p, q and N if historical sales data is available.

==Fourt-Woodlock model==
The [[Fourt-Woodlock_equation|Fourt-Woodlock]] model is another method used to estimate product sales.

&lt;math&gt;V = (HH \cdot TR \cdot TU) + (HH\cdot TR\cdot MR \cdot RR \cdot RU)&lt;/math&gt;

The left-hand-side of the equation is the volume of purchases per unit time (usually taken to be one year).  On the right-hand-side, the first parentheses describes trial volume, and the second describes repeat volume.  

HH is the total number of households in the geographic area of projection, and TR ("trial rate") is the percentage of those households which will purchase the product for the first time in a given time period.  TU ("trial units") is the number of units purchased on this first purchase occasion.  MR is "measured repeat," or the percentage of those who tried the product who will purchase it at least one more time within the first year of the product's launch.  RR is the repeats per repeater: the number of repeat purchases within that same year.  RU is the number of repeat units purchased on each repeat event.

==Assessor Model (Promotional Content)==

===Preference===
By examining the brand preference for each brand in a competitive context, preference shares for each brand can be determined.
Assessor is owned by M/A/R/C Research ( http://www.marcresearch.com/ ) and can be used for concept screening, testing and volumetric forecasting.  In combination with Choice Modeling it can be used to optimize offers and products.

===Awareness Model===
Based on the brands planned [[marketing mix]] of advertising in multiple vehicles, the ultimate brand awareness can be projected through time.

A '''registered office''' is the official address of an [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] [[company (law)|company]], association or any other [[Juristic person|legal entity]]. Generally it will form part of the public record and is required in most countries where the registered [[organization]] or legal entity is incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Arthur. ''The European Film Production Guide: Finance, Tax, Legislation''. [[Routledge]], 1996. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_14gq_KsRwMC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22Registered+office%22+definition&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1tAuTPSHDcWqlAfJwIyTCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Registered%20office%22%20definition&amp;f=false 21]. Retrieved from [[Google Books]] on 3 July 2010. {{ISBN|0-415-13665-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-13665-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A registered physical office address is required for incorporated organizations to receive official correspondence and formal notices from government departments, investors, banks, shareholders and the general public.&lt;ref name="A&amp;T"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adirondack|first1=Sandy|last2=Taylor|first2=James Sinclair|title=Voluntary sector legal handbook|date=2008|publisher=Directory of Social Change|location=London|isbn=9781903991879|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|209}}

==In the United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]] and many other [[List of country legal systems#Common law|common law countries]], the registered office address does not have to be where the organization conducts its actual business or trade, and it is not unusual for [[law firms]], [[accountant]]s or incorporation agents to provide the official registered office address service. In the United Kingdom all statutory correspondence for an incorporated organization (e.g. formal notices, [[service of process]], tax and government communications) is posted or hand delivered to the registered office address as recorded on the [[Companies House]] register. A registered physical office address is required for incorporated organizations to receive official correspondence and formal notices from government departments, investors, banks, shareholders and the general public.&lt;ref name="A&amp;T"/&gt;{{rp|209}}

Under regulations implemented in the UK on 1 October 2009, company directors may now also use a registered office address instead of their private home address for contact on the Companies House register.

The company's full registered name must be visible to the public on the premises. The Company's records previously had to be kept at the registered office and available for public inspection. Since 1 October 2009 it has been possible for companies to designate a single alternative inspection location (SAIL) as a place to keep their records which must be available for public inspection.&lt;ref name="A&amp;T"/&gt;{{rp|210}}

==Other countries==
In many other countries the address with which a company is registered must be where its headquarters or [[Seat (legal entity)|seat]] is located, and this will often determine the subnational registry at which the company must be registered.

'''Sergio Zyman''' (born July 30, 1945) is a [[marketing]] executive from Mexico best known as the marketer behind the failed launch of [[New Coke]], now regarded as one of the greatest marketing blunders of all time.

==New Coke==
A cover story in [[Fortune Magazine]] from May 1, 1995 referred to [[New Coke]] as the biggest marketing blunder since the launch of [[Ford]]'s [[Edsel]].  [[New Coke]] was a reformulation of the original [[Coca-Cola]] flavor. After significant consumer opposition, the original flavor was reintroduced after  77 days. 

''Fortune Magazine'' reported:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Zyman, then head of U.S. marketing, was coming off his enormously successful introduction of diet Coke when he was assigned day-to-day responsibility for top-secret Project Kansas in 1984. The zealous Mexican insisted that Coca-Cola (or Co-Coola, as he pronounces it) must act boldly to reverse its 20-year market-share decline vs. Pepsi. Zyman, a former Pepsi marketer, argued that the correct strategy was to replace 98-year-old Coke with a better-tasting cola, label it [[New Coke]]," and blare the news--which is exactly what the company did one decade ago this April. Zyman's greatest error, which some attribute to ego, was that he and his team failed to present the option of keeping old Coke on the market.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Career==
Zyman's work experience includes tenures with [[Coca-Cola]], [[PepsiCo]], and [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], and his own firm Zyman Group. He is also known for helping introduce [[Diet Coke]] in 1982 and conceiving [[Fruitopia]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1995/05/01/202473/index.htm |title=SO YOU FAIL.

After leaving the Coca-Cola Company, Zyman launched a [[consulting]] firm called the Zyman Group, which he sold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB111239734276795869?mod=googlewsj |title=MDC Takes Majority Stake In Sergio Zyman's Firm - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2005-04-01 |accessdate=2010-06-02 | first=Suzanne | last=Vranica}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[MDC Partners]] Inc., a Canadian advertising firm [[holding company]], for around $60 million in April 2005. He was replaced there as Chairman by Scott Miller, formerly with [[McCann Erickson]]. The Zyman Group is no longer in business. 

Sergio Zyman was most recently a director of Upstream Worldwide, the [[parent company]] of [[uSell.com]], but he has been replaced there and is no longer on the Executive Team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usell.com/about.htm#Team Team]&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with [[JC Penney]] as a Marketing Consultant, but was fired by Chief Operating Officer Mike Ullman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bloomberg News]].  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-09/ackman-calls-for-ouster-of-j-c-penney-chairman.html Ackman calls for ouster of JC Penney chairman]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Sergio Zyman is of Mexican [[Jewish]] heritage and is originally a native of [[Mexico City]]. He attended executive programs at [[Harvard University]] and graduate schools in London, Paris and Jerusalem though his professional resume does not list a graduate degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigspeak.com/sergio-zyman.html |title=Sergio Zyman: Coca Cola CMO |publisher=Bigspeak.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published works==
Zyman has written four books  on   marketing and advertising, including:
*''The End of Advertising as We Know It'' with Armin Brott. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2002
*''The End of Marketing as We Know It''

A '''shōtengai''' (商店街) is a style of Japanese [[commercial district]] running along a certain street.  Shōtengai often connect to the nearest train station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Imai |first=Heide |year=2017 |title=Tokyo Roji: The Diversity and Versatility of Alleys in a City in Transition |publisher=Routledge |page=62 |isbn=9781317363644}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most suburbs and towns of Japan have shōtengai of varying size, and larger shōtengai may take the form of covered [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]] that are blocked off to traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Collin |year=2012 |title=Evolution of a Retail Streetscape: DP Architects on Orchard Road |publisher=Images Publishing |page=42 |isbn=9781864704624}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical shōtengai includes most of these:

* supermarkets and grocery shops
* restaurants, cafés and [[kissaten]]
* [[izakaya]] and [[snack bar]]s (Japanese-style pubs with mostly male clientele; usually run and/or staffed by women)
* [[pachinko]] parlors

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2235">'''Sigma''' (Science in General Management) was a [[limited company]] established by [[Henry Novy]], [[Stafford Beer]] and [[Roger Eddison]] in 1961. It sold [[operational research]] OR in the [[United Kingdom]] and overseas. Beer was responsible for the cybernetic models of organisation and corporate planning which were the firm's specially. Eddison was the Operations Director.

The consultancy arose following discussions between the Société d’Économie et de Mathématiques Appliquées (SEMA) and Martech Consultants Limited. Novy, who ran Maretch, was given the job of selecting the people to run the company, inviting several OR practitioners to come to Paris for an interview. After he selected Beer, Beer only agreed if Eddison would also join him. This was arranged and the company was launched with a reception at the [[Connaught Hotel]] in October 1961.&lt;ref name="Beer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beer |first1=Stafford |title=Roger Tatham Eddison: an appreciation |journal=Journal of the Operational Research Society |date=August 2000 |volume=51 |issue=8 |pages=1004–1007 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.jors.2600989 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1057/palgrave.jors.2600989 |accessdate=29 September 2018 |language=en |issn=0160-5682}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Over the next five years Sigma developed into a substantial organisation providing services to several leading companies across the UK as well as for six government departments. It also took on contracts in the United States and several developing countries. Amongst the diverse areas it worked in were energy, for the [[Gas Council]], transportation, for [[British Rail]] and the [[Port of London Authority]], shipbuilding, for the [[Geddes Committee]], education for [[Yugoslavia]], tourism, for [[Israel]], nationalised industry in South America, and distribution for a variety of industrial firms.&lt;ref name="GCF"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cabezas Fuentealba|first1=Guido|title=Beer|url=http://www.oocities.org/gicabezas/Beer.html|website=www.oocities.org|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sigma, Martech, and Proplan were amalgamated to form what afterwards became the Metra Consulting Group in the United Kingdom.

'''Social BI''', or '''Social Business Intelligence''', refers to the creation, publishing and sharing of custom [[business analytics]] reports and [[Dashboards (management information systems)|dashboard]]s by end users of ''[[Cloud computing|Cloud]]'' technologies.

Social or collaborative BI is the use of Enterprise 2.0 tools and practices with business intelligence outputs for the purpose of making collective decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forteconsultancy.wordpress.com/2014/11/12/social-bi-for-intelligent-enterprise-2-0/ |title=Social BI for Intelligent Enterprise 2.0 |accessdate= 12 November 2014 |publisher= Forte Consultancy Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; First enabled by the rapid growth of [[social media]] networks in 2009, Social BI allows for the collaborative development of post user-generated analytics among [[business analyst]]s and data mining professionals.  This has removed previous barriers to [[business intelligence|self-service BI]] while still employing traditional analytics applications.

Social BI can also be interpreted as providing business intelligence based on social networks data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.groupcharger.com/social-business-intelligence/ |title=1 Social Business Intelligence |accessdate= 28 November 2011 |publisher= GroupCharger}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a company selling consumer electronics goods needs to know how people are responding to their latest advertisements or promotions. The reports and visualizations made using social media represent what people are talking about in real time. Pulling data from different social media and preparing understandable reports will help company to decide upon further steps. These dashboards, [[Computer graphics|visualizations]], reports based on social media will be of help for companies to get efficient feedback and act accordingly.

==History==
On September 13, 2011, [[Dachis Group]] introduced the Social Business Index to provide some insights into how ‘social’ companies are, and how they stack up against similar corporations in their respective industries and their competitors, and provide some ‘social business’ benchmarks by company, subsidiary, geography, department and brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/13/dachis-group-debuts-social-business-index-think-of-it-as-klout-for-companies/ |title=2 Dachis Group Debuts ‘Social Business Index’ – Think Of It As Klout For Companies |accessdate= 28 November 2011 |author= Robin Wauters |date= 2011-09-13 |work= |publisher= Techcrunch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Springpad''' was a free [[online application]] and [[web service]] that allowed its registered [[User (computing)|users]] to save, organize and share collected ideas and information. As users added content to their Springpad accounts, the application automatically identified and categorized it, then generated additional snippets based on the types of objects added—for example, listing price comparisons for products and showtimes for movies.

Springpad was also available as apps on the [[iPad]], [[iPhone]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] that synchronized with the Web interface. Springpad was bundled on new [[Toshiba]] notebook computers through a Web application subscription service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.toshiba.com/offers/24716 apps.toshiba.com The Essentials] Retrieved January 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 2014, Springpad announced that it would cease operations on June 25, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://springpad.com/blog/2014/05/announcement-springpad-shutting-down] Retrieved May 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The company then allowed users to export their data (as [[json]] and read-only [[html]] formats), or to automatically migrate it to [[Evernote]] accounts before the expiration date.

== Features ==
Springpad users could use the main site interface which uses [[HTML5]] from most browsers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/214975/five_great_free_business_apps_for_google_chrome.html |title=Five Great Free Business Apps for Google Chrome |accessdate=December 29, 2010 |last=Thomas |first=Keir |date=December 27, 2010 |work=PCWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; or use the smartphone app to capture notes, tasks, or lists which were then added to the user's "My Stuff", the user's personal database or collection. Additionally Springpad let users look up items of interest which were then automatically categorized based on type or manually categorized by the user. Category types included recipes, movies, products, restaurants and wine. Events could also be added to Springpad, and if the user used [[Google Calendar]], they could opt to sync the event to it.

In addition to the smartphone app and site, Springpad could be used via browser [[Google Chrome Extensions|extension]] for [[Google Chrome]], or the Springpad Clipper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.springpadit.com/2010/02/springpad-clipper/ |title=Get the Springpad Clipper |accessdate=December 29, 2010 |work=blog.springpadit.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[bookmarklet]] to analyze webpages and clip relevant information from them—for example, the ingredients needed for a recipe—or to add the site as a normal bookmark. Another way users could add content to their Springpad "My Stuff" was by emailing entries to an email address specified on Springpad registration.

Springpad's smartphone apps could be used to scan barcodes to identify products, save them to the user's "My Stuff", and automatically generate additional product information and links. The mobile app could also save images taken with the phone's camera, and locate nearby businesses.

With most of the content added to a user's "My Stuff", relevant news, useful links and other helpful information could be viewed. Users could also attach additional notes and images to content they had already saved, and could add reminders and alerts which could be emailed to the user or texted to their phone. Springpad also added alerts to its own Alerts section for relevant news, deals or coupons for specific products users added.

For additional organization, anything added to Springpad could also be [[Tag (metadata)|tagged]]. Users could also add entries to "Notebooks" to separate content by projects, or any other way they wished. Each Notebook included a section called a "Board", which acted as a [[pin board]] where users could "pin" content they'd added to the Notebook, allowing them to visually lay out items. If the user added a map to the Board and had entries that included an address, Springpad could automatically point out entries on the map.

By default, everything added to Springpad was private. However users could change the privacy settings for each of the types of items added, decide to make specific items public and shareable on [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], add them to their public page, or keep them private but links to them with specific people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="681">A '''sum certain''' is a specified and set amount of money owed by one person to another. It is a legal [[term of art]], having specialized meaning in the law. Some kinds of legal claims can not be brought at all unless the sum certain can be plead. A document claimed to be a [[negotiable instrument]] can not be negotiated unless it is for a sum certain.

{{redirect|Trusteeship}} 
'''Trustee''' (or the holding of a '''trusteeship''') is a [[legal term]] which, in its broadest sense, is a synonym for anyone in a [[position of trust]] and so can refer to any person who holds property, authority, or a position of trust or responsibility for the benefit of another. A trustee can also refer to a person who is allowed to do certain tasks but not able to gain income.&lt;ref name="Black's Law 5th"&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition'' (1979), p. 1357, {{ISBN|0-8299-2041-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although in the strictest sense of the term a trustee is the holder of property on behalf of a [[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiary]],&lt;ref name="Black's Law 5th"/&gt; the more expansive sense encompasses persons who serve, for example, on the [[Board of directors|board of trustees]] of an institution that operates for a charity, for the benefit of the general public, or a person in the local government.

A [[Trust law|trust]] can be set up either to benefit particular persons, or for any [[Charitable trust|charitable purposes]] (but not generally for non-charitable purposes): typical examples are a [[testamentary trust|will trust]] for the [[testator]]'s children and family, a [[pension]] trust (to confer benefits on employees and their families) and a charitable trust. In all cases, the trustee may be a person or [[company]], whether or not they are a prospective beneficiary.

Trustees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/trusting/unit5all.html|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics and the Law, Definition of "fiduciary duties" by Tamar Frankel Vol.2, p.127-128 |publisher=Harvard Edu|accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; have certain duties (some of which are [[fiduciary]]).  These include the duty to:

* Carry out the expressed terms of the trust instrument &lt;ref name="Youyang"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|15|2003|litigants=[[Youyang Pty Ltd v Minter Ellison Morris Fletcher]]  |parallelcite=(2003) 212 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 484 |date=3 April 2003 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; - A trustee is bound to act in accordance with the terms of the trusts upon which he or she holds trust property, and commits a breach of trust if he or she departs from the terms of the trust.&lt;ref name="Breen v Williams"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|57|1996|litigants=[[Breen v Williams]] ("Medical Records Access case") |parallelcite=(1996) 186 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 71|date=6 September 1996 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a trustee may act otherwise than in accordance with the terms of the trust if all beneficiaries, being ''sui juris'' and together absolutely entitled, direct the trustee to do so (or so consent). If any question arises as to the constriction of the provisions of the trust, the trustee must approach the court for determination of the question.
* Defend the trust
* Prudently invest trust assets (in [[New South Wales]], this is mandated by ''Trustee Act 1925'' (NSW) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ta1925122|Trustee Act 1925}} ss14, 14A &amp; 14C.&lt;/ref&gt;)
* Be impartial among beneficiaries - the trustee must act impartially between individual beneficiaries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicLawRp|70|1948|litigants=Tanti v Carlson |parralelcite=[1948] [[Victorian Law Reports|VLR]] 401 |date=2 April 1948 |courtname=[[Supreme Court of Victoria|Supreme Court]] (Vic)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as between different classes of beneficiaries.
* Account for actions and keep beneficiaries informed, these include a duty to inform beneficiaries as to their entitlements under the trust&lt;ref&gt;Hawkesley v May [1956]&lt;/ref&gt; and other matters concerning the trust. Trustees do not have priority right to trust documents; it is a personal right and cannot be assigned&lt;ref&gt;Global Custodians v Mesh [2002]&lt;/ref&gt; The right to seek disclosure of trust documents is an aspect of the court's inherent jurisdiction to supervise the administration of trusts.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt v Rosewood Trust [2003]&lt;/ref&gt; As trustees as not under a duty to disclose their reasoning in applying a trust power (unless the trust instrument requires otherwise), there is no duty to disclose any documents dealing with the decision making promise.&lt;ref&gt;Tierney v King [1983]&lt;/ref&gt; Protection of confidentiality has been described as 'one of the most important limitations on the right to disclose of trust documents'. 'Memoranda or letter of wishes' do not necessarily need to be disclosed to a beneficiary if they are of a number of potential beneficiaries.
* Be loyal
* Not delegate
* Not profit; however, may charge fees for services to the Trust &lt;ref&gt;Case law authority ''Keech v Sanford'' [1726] EWHC Ch J76 [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/1726/J76.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Not be in a conflict of interest position
* Administer in the best interest of the beneficiaries
The modern interpretation of fiduciary duty requires the consideration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors as these are long-term investment value drivers.&lt;ref&gt;PRI, UNEP FI, &amp; The Generation Foundation. [https://www.fiduciaryduty21.org/ Fiduciary Duty in the 21st Century]. 2018&lt;/ref&gt; When evaluating whether or not an institutional investor has delivered on its fiduciary duties, both the outcomes achieved and the process followed are of critical importance. 

The terms of instrument that creates the trust may narrow or expand these duties&amp;mdash;but in most instances they cannot be eliminated completely. Corporate trustees, typically trust departments at large banks, often have very narrow duties, limited to those the trust indenture explicitly defines.

A trustee carries the fiduciary responsibility and liability to use the trust assets according to the provisions of the trust instrument (and often regardless of their own or the beneficiaries' wishes). The trustee may find himself liable to [[claimant]]s, prospective beneficiaries, or third parties. In the event that a trustee incurs a liability (for example, in [[litigation]], or for taxes, or under the terms of a lease) in excess of the trust property they hold, they may find themselves personally liable for the excess.

Trustees are generally held to a "prudent person" standard in regard to meeting their fiduciary responsibilities, though investment, legal, and other professionals can, in some jurisdictions, be held to a higher standard commensurate with their higher expertise.&lt;ref&gt;see: “ Speight v Gaunt [1883] EWCA Civ 1 [http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1883/1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;-Trustees can be paid for their time and trouble in performing their duties only if the trust specifically provides for payment. It is common for lawyers to draft will trusts so as to permit such payment, and to take office accordingly: this may be an unnecessary expense for small estates.

In an exception to the duties outlined above, [[sabbatical officer]]s of [[students' union]]s who are also trustees of these organisations they work for do have the right to a salary (and hence profit from their being a trustee). This is an exception explicitly granted in the 1993 act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Publications/cc3.aspx#f2 |title=CC3 - The Essential Trustee: What you need to know |publisher=Charity-commission.gov.uk |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The broadest sense of the term ''trustee'' applies to someone held to a fiduciary duty similar in some respects to that of a trustee proper. For example, the directors of a bank may be trustees for the [[depositor]]s, directors of a [[corporation]] are trustees for the [[stockholder]]s and a guardian is trustee of his ward's property. Many corporations call their governing board a board of trustees, though in those cases they act as a [[board of directors]].

===Charities in the United Kingdom===
In the case of UK [[charitable trust|charities]], a ''trustee'' is a volunteer who undertakes fiduciary responsibilities on behalf of the charity, subject to the provisions of Charity Law, a branch of trust law, and the [[Charities Act 1993]].&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|title=Charities Act 1993|path=ukpga/1992/38}}&lt;/ref&gt; For charity trustees, the [[Charity Commission]]  of England and Wales, [[Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator]] of Scotland and [[Voluntary Activity Unit]] of Northern Ireland often has concurrent jurisdiction with the courts. Many UK charities are also [[Limited company|limited liability companies]] registered with [[Companies House]], in this case the trustees are also directors of the company and their liability is limited. This is the preferred model if the charity owns property or employs people.

The law on this in England changed considerably with the Charities Act of 2006.  An account of the main changes can be found in "Charities Act 2006 A guide to the new law" by Michael King and Ann Phillips{{Who|date=August 2015}}.  One of the key changes made was that it introduced the [[Charitable Incorporated Organisation]] which is basically a limited liability charity.  There are thus now two main aspects of corporate management of charities.

One is the traditional way in which a corporation is a corporate trustee of a given charity.  The second is the new way, in which the charity itself is incorporated as a CIO.  The advantages and disadvantages of the different methods is a complicated matter.  According to King and Philips, many of the advantages of incorporating as a CIO are obtained if the trustees are not individuals but a corporate entity. {{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}

===Local government in the United States===
Depending on the state, a trustee is a member of the ''village board of trustees'', which is a village's elected [[legislative body]] as outlined by local or state law. It can be composed of the [[mayor]] and a set number of trustees and usually manages village property, finances, safety, health, comfort, and general welfare and leadership of the town (acting as a board of police or fire commissioners or a moderate income housing board for example).  ''Village board of trustees'' is comparable to but distinguished from  [[city council]] or [[town council]].  Small villages have a trustee instead of a mayor, who is elected to manage village business in a similar function.

In some states, a [[civil township]] may be administered by a trustee or a group of trustees; see [[Indiana Township Trustee]] for an example.

==={{anchor|Correctional institution usage}}Correctional institution usage===
{{see also|Trusty system (prison)}}
In this context, a "trusty" is a prisoner who is trusted not to attempt an escape, and therefore requires little or no guarding.  For example, a trusty may be allowed to leave the prison to attend work or other important events.  Many times, "trusty" is misspelled{{cn|reason=citation needed for 'misspelled' claim - as a Google search today gave 'about 15000' hits for 'prison trustee' (including the item that resulted in this 'citation needed'), and only 'about 8970' for 'prison trusty', though also 'about 2710' for 'trusty prisoner' against only 'about 605' for 'trustee prisoner'. (Note: Googling without 'prison' or 'prisoner' gives too many examples unrelated to prison to be of use here). |date=October 2018}} as "trustee".

==Bankruptcy trustee==
In the United States, when a consumer or business files for bankruptcy all property belonging to the filer becomes property of a newly created entity, the "[[Estate (law)#Bankruptcy|bankruptcy estate]]".  (See 11 U.S.C. § 541.) For all bankruptcies (consumer or business) filed under [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]], [[Chapter 12, Title 11, United States Code|12]] or [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|13]] of [[Title 11 of the United States Code]] (the Bankruptcy Code), a trustee (the "[[trustee in bankruptcy]]" or TIB) is appointed by the [[United States Trustee]], an officer of the Department of Justice that is charged with ensuring the integrity of the bankruptcy system and with representatives in each court, to manage the property of the bankruptcy estate, including bringing actions to avoid pre-bankruptcy transfers of property.  In bankruptcies filed under [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]], the [[debtor]] continues to manage the property of the bankruptcy estate, as "[[debtor in possession]]," subject to replacement for cause with a trustee.

Chapter 7 trustees in bankruptcy are chosen by the United States Trustee from a panel, and are known as panel trustees.  Every judicial district has a permanent Chapter 13 trustee, known as a "standing trustee." As cases under Chapter 12 (for family farmers or fishermen) are filed fairly infrequently, the United States Trustee usually makes trustee appointments in such cases on an ad hoc basis.

==UK legislation==

The '''School of Accounting and Finance (SAF)''' at [[University of Waterloo]] is a ''professional school'' within the Faculty of Arts. The School was established in 1985 under the name 'School of Accountancy'. Its name was changed in 2008 to better reflect its program offering.&lt;ref name="Vision and Challenge"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.accounting.uwaterloo.ca/history.pdf | title = Vision and Challenge: Accounting Education at the University of Waterloo 1981–2001| accessdate = 2009-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, nearly 1000 students are enrolled in the School's programs. In September, 2009 a new {{convert|52,000|sqft|m2|sigfig=1}} building was officially opened to house the School.

The School of Accounting and Finance offers the largest accounting and finance undergraduate [[cooperative education]] (co-op) program in Canada.&lt;ref name="The Directory of Canadian Universities"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aucc.ca/can_uni/our_universities/waterloo_e.html | title = The Directory of Canadian Universities: The University of Waterloo | accessdate = 2007-05-31 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070607120628/http://www.aucc.ca/can_uni/our_universities/waterloo_e.html | archivedate = 2007-06-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School's [[Master of Accounting]] (MAcc) Program allows students to complete all required CPA modules within 8 months, and is only open to students who complete the School's undergrad programs. MAcc graduates only need to challenge (and pass) the [[Common Final Examination]] and accumulate the required professional experiences in order to become a [[Chartered Professional Accountant]] (CPA). MAcc and industry experiences gained from co-op is well-known among Canadian accounting and finance industries.

==Programs of Study==

The School of Accounting and Finance offers four undergraduate programs, two graduate programs and one doctoral program. Additionally, the School jointly administers one undergraduate program and one graduate program with the [[University of Waterloo Faculty of Mathematics|Faculty of Mathematics]] and one undergraduate program with the [[University of Waterloo Faculty of Science|Faculty of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=One School - Four Programs, Three Faculties |url=https://uwaterloo.ca/school-of-accounting-and-finance/undergraduate |website=University of Waterloo |publisher=University of Waterloo |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Undergraduate Education==
'''Bachelor of Accounting and Financial Management Co-op (BAFM):'''
* Students in the BAFM Program build on expertise in accounting and finance starting year 1, with co-op work terms beginning in year 2. AFM students take a variety of courses such as financial accounting, managerial accounting, information technology/data science, business law, and corporate finance to satisfy the required CPA education requirements. Starting in year 3, AFM students may continue taking the CPA courses, or seek a career in finance utilizing electives to take advanced finance courses. Ample enough of elective space is allocated for BAFM students to customize their degree to focus on both CPA and finance, or to pursue a minor. 
* Graduates of the BAFM program typically aspire to a host of professional accounting and/or finance credentials such as the [[Chartered Professional Accountant]] (CPA), [[Chartered Financial Analyst]] (CFA) and [[Chartered Business Valuator]] (CBV) designations. All BAFM graduates are eligible to apply to the School's MAcc program. Students in BAFM must complete 4 co-op work terms, in total of 16 months of experiences, which could be eligible for CPA accreditation purposes (30 months required).

'''Mathematics/Chartered Professional Accountancy Co-op (Math/CPA):'''
* Math/CPA students have less flexibility in their degree as students take math courses along with the accounting and finance courses BAFM students take, leaving very few elective spaces. The work-term sequence is structured similar to the BAFM schedule, with 4 co-op terms. The Math/CA program was renamed to Math/CPA in 2013.

'''Biotechnology/Chartered Professional Accountancy Co-op (Biotech/CPA):'''
* This program is offered jointly with the Faculty of Science. Students in the Biotech/CPA program take science courses along with the accounting and finance courses. Biotech/CPA students have little flexibility in their degree, and in some terms, are required to take extra courses. Biotech/CPA students composed of the smallest population in the School, with only around 10-15 students admitted per academic year. Students in the program may obtain co-op employment deemed by professional bodies to be ''qualifying practical experience'' for accreditation purposes, similar to BAFM and Math/CPA, with 4 required co-op terms. Biotech/CPA students are eligible to apply to the School's MAcc program. The Biotech/CA program was renamed to Biotech/CPA in 2013.

'''Bachelor of Computing and Financial Management (BCFM):'''
* This program is offered jointly with the [[David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science]] in the Faculty of Mathematics. Students take computer science courses along with accounting and finance courses. Stronger emphasis is placed upon computer science and finance, less on accounting. The students receive a unique degree in Canada, "Bachelor of Computing and Financial Management" after graduation. Students in this program typically complete six co-op work terms, with the first commencing between semester two and three. CFM students/graduates are not eligible to apply to the School's MAcc program and are unable to take advantage of the CPA accreditation.

==Postgraduate Education==
'''Master of Accounting (MAcc):'''
* This 8-month program is accredited by [[CPA Canada]], so students who successfully complete the program, including all CPA requirements, are exempt from all 6 modules of the CPA Professional Education Program and may proceed directly to the Common Final Examination (CFE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Master of Accounting |url=https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-academic-calendar/arts/school-accounting-and-finance/master-accounting-macc |website=Graduate Studies Academic Calendar |publisher=University of Waterloo |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from gaining depth in the CPA elective subjects including Taxation, Assurance, Performance Management and Finance, MAcc students can explore other career options such as business valuations, forensic accounting, data analytics, internal audit and international tax. Approximately 65% of undergrads pursue the MAcc degree in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=School of Accounting and Finance annual reports |url=https://uwaterloo.ca/school-of-accounting-and-finance/sites/ca.school-of-accounting-and-finance/files/uploads/files/c015268_saf_coop_career_launch_report_print_lr_accessible-s.pdf |website=School of Accounting &amp; Finance |publisher=University of Waterloo |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Furthermore, students who have taken and passed ''ACC606 Business Valuations'' receive advanced standings in the [[Canadian Institute of Chartered Business Valuators]] (CICBV) Programme of Studies. Students will receive exemptions for ''Level I – Introductory Business Valuation'' and ''Level II – Intermediate Business Valuation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Course Exemptions |url=https://cicbv.ca/course-exemptions/ |website=CICBV |publisher=Canadian Institute of Chartered Business Valuators |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Master of Taxation (MTax):'''
* This program is open to all students from different backgrounds to apply. MTax is offered under a full-time basis (1 year + 1 co-op term) or a part-time basis (2 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Course Schedule |url=https://uwaterloo.ca/master-of-taxation/prospective-students/academic-information/course-schedule |website=Master of Taxation |publisher=University of Waterloo |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduates attain broad-based competencies in tax subject areas that include policy, research, statutory interpretation, estate planning, business structuring, and risk management, with all the classes held in [[downtown Toronto]]'s [[Eaton Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Master of Taxation |url=https://uwaterloo.ca/master-of-taxation/ |website=University of Waterloo |publisher=University of Waterloo |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Master of Quantitative Finance (MQF):'''
* Focuses on the fundamental disciplines of mathematics, statistics, econometrics, computer science and finance. This program is offered jointly with [[University of Waterloo Faculty of Mathematics|Faculty of Mathematics]].

'''PhD in Accounting:'''
* The University of Waterloo’s School of Accounting and Finance can provide doctoral training in research that is based on economic theory, empirical economics, behavioural science, and other methodologies.

==School Reputation and Achievement==
The School of Accounting &amp; Finance has had success in its students and faculty research. Notably, many students who have challenged the [[Common Final Examination]] achieves honour roll as well as gold medal (Ontario and National).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Awards &amp; Achievements |url=https://uwaterloo.ca/school-of-accounting-and-finance/welcome-alumni-friends/awards-achievements |website=School of Accounting &amp; Finance |publisher=University of Waterloo |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[co-operative education]], many students secured full-time employment before graduation. In 2017, 100% of MTax graduates were employed before graduation, while 98% of AFM, Biotech/CPA, Math/CPA and MAcc students found employment within 6 months after graduation. The co-op employment rate has been consistently at around 97% to 100% with the students placed in [[Big Four accounting firms]], chartered banks, government, non-profit organizations, and non-financial institutions with roles such as staff accountant, financial analyst, tax analyst, investment banker, private equity analyst, data science intern and trader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=School of Accounting and Finance annual reports |url=https://uwaterloo.ca/school-of-accounting-and-finance/sites/ca.school-of-accounting-and-finance/files/uploads/files/c015268_saf_coop_career_launch_report_print_lr_accessible-s.pdf |website=School of Accounting &amp; Finance |publisher=University of Waterloo |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[QS World University Rankings]], School of Accounting and Finance ranks 101-150 globally in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Accounting &amp; Finance |url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2018/accounting-finance |website=Top Universities |publisher=QS Quacquarelli Symonds Limited |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, School of Accounting &amp; Finance students won the global annual [[CFA Institute|CFA Institute Research Challenge]]. The CFA Institute Research Challenge leverages the efforts of over 140 CFA member societies, 3,500 member volunteers, and more than 5,000 students from over 1,000 universities. The CFA Institute Research Challenge requires student teams (1 team per university) to research and analyze a publicly-traded company and then write a research report on their assigned company with a buy, sell, or hold recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Past Research Challenge Champions. |url=https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/societies/challenge/past-champions |website=CFA Institute |publisher=CFA Institute |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SAF Students Capture World Championship at the CFA Investment Research Challenge |url=https://uwaterloo.ca/school-of-accounting-and-finance/news/saf-students-capture-world-championship-cfa-investment |website=School of Accounting and Finance |publisher=University of Waterloo |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yosef Fischer''' ({{Lang-he|יוסף פישר}}, born 11 February 1920, died 14 December 1992) was an [[Israel]]i politician who served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for [[Mapai]] and its successors between 1959 and 1969.

==Biography==
Born in [[Budapest]] in [[Hungary]], Fischer made [[aliyah]] to [[Mandatory Palestine]] in 1935. Between 1938 and 1940 he served in the [[British Army]] as a [[Haganah]] emissary, before working as a cadet in the [[Jewish Settlement Police]] in [[Hanita]] and the [[Haifa Bay]] area from 1940 until 1943.

A Haganah instructor, he was commander of the [[Kfar Azar]] training camp in 1947. Between 1947 and 1949 he worked as a manager, before establishing a machine shop in 1949 and becoming active in the Small Industries Association.

In 1952 he joined [[Mapai]], and was elected to the Knesset on the party's list in [[Israeli legislative election, 1959|1959]]. He was re-elected in [[Israeli legislative election, 1961|1961]] and [[Israeli legislative election, 1965|1965]], before losing his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1969|1969 elections]].

He died in 1992 at the age of 72.

'''''Your Trading Edge Magazine''''' is a bi-monthly magazine for traders and active investors covering [[CFDs]], [[stock]]s, [[Options (finance)|options]], [[Futures contract|futures]], [[forex]] and [[Commodity market|commodities]].

==History==
''YourTradingEdge'' (''YTE'') began as a customer newsletter for the [[Sydney Futures Exchange]] (SFE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asxgroup.com.au/history.htm |title=History |work=Asx Group|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1997. SFE then began professionally publishing it as a magazine.

In early 2001, ''YTE'' was acquired by MarketSource International. Many of the former contributors re-joined the new ''YTE'' during the first year, including highly respected industry identities Michael Pascoe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conference.acpet.edu.au/keynote_speakers.html#9|title=ACPET 2011 National Conference • Brisbane • 24-26 August 2011 |work=ACPET|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dawn Bolton-Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketmasters.com.au/72.0.html|title=Dawn Bolton Smith - Market Master |work=Market Masters|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine is distributed in Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Brunei and Indonesia, as well as the United Kingdom.

In 2006 the title was picked up by Australia's largest newsagency chain, ''[[Newslink]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsaspac.com/ls_brands_detail.asp?id=3 |title=Lagardère Services Asia Pacific - Our Brands|publisher=Lagardère|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also picked up by [[Qantas]], [[Virgin Blue]], [[Air New Zealand]] and [[Singapore Airlines]] for distribution in their frequent flyer lounges. 

In 2010 ''YTE'' launched its first digital edition on the BeBook&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bebook.net.au/pages/Press.html|title=Bebook Australia - ebook and ereader specialist |work=Bebook|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; e-reader, then later via [[Exact Editions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exacteditions.com/exact/browse/635/1200 |title=YourTradingEdge|work=Exacteditions|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Apple iStore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/yourtradingedge-magazine/id443427763?mt=8 |title=iTunes Store|work=itunes.apple|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, YTE Magazine was relaunched and acquired by EOS Publications.

'''Zoopy''' was an online and mobile social media community, hosting user generated videos, photos and audio. It launched into closed beta in late 2006 and moved into live beta with public access on 5 March 2007.

In December 2007, [[Nokia]] selected Zoopy as their regional imaging partner for South and West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bizcommunity.com/Article/196/16/20479.html|publisher=Bizcommunity|title=Nokia, Zoopy partner for online imaging|date=December 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 26, 2008, [[Vodacom]] purchased a 40% share stake in Zoopy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mybroadband.co.za/news/internet/4280-vodacom-invests-in-zoopy.html |title=Vodacom invests in Zoopy |first=Rudolph |last=Muller |work=mybroadband.co.za |date=26 June 2008 |accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increased their stake to 75% as announced on February 13, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.zoopy.com/?p=187 |title=Zoopy Blog |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216174057/http://blog.zoopy.com/?p=187 |archivedate=February 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before purchasing the full 100% of the company in September 2010.

On 1 February 2011, Zoopy repositioned itself as a mobile video entertainment platform, delivering videos of the latest news, sport and entertainment in 90 seconds or less.

At the end of February 2012, director Gerry Da Silva resigned from the company. At the end of September 2012, directors Pat Elk and Jason Elk left the company.

The Zoopy website has since shut down.
