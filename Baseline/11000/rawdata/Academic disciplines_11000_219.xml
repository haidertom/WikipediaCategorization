'''9-slice scaling''' (also known as '''Scale 9 grid''' or '''9-slicing''') is a 2D image resizing technique to proportionally scale an image by splitting it in a grid of nine parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lynda.com/Illustrator-tutorials/9-slice-scaling-explained/135243/149344-4.html|title=9-slice scaling explained|website=Lynda.com - from LinkedIn|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key idea is to prevent [[image scaling]] distortion by protecting the pixels defined in 4 parts (corners) of the image and scaling or repeating the pixels in the other 5 parts. 

A variation of the concept, the 3-slice scaling, consists in a grid of 3 parts in which only the pixels in 2 parts (the edges) are protected and the pixels on the middle part are repeated.

== History and use ==
The concept was first introduced in a consumer application by [[Macromedia]] in [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] 8 (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/8/releasenotes.html|title=Macromedia - Flash : Flash 8 Release Notes|website=www.adobe.com|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was available as feature to scale symbols. Later on, in 2007 Adobe introduced it as a feature in [[Adobe Fireworks]] CS3&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/archive/fireworks/articles/9-slice_scaling.html|title=Improved 9-slice scaling in Fireworks|website=www.adobe.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Adobe Illustrator]], and [[Adobe Flash]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1057744/flashcs3.html|title=Flash CS3 Professional|first1=David |last1=Karlins|date=May 7, 2007

Today is also present as a feature of game development software like [[Unreal Engine|Unreal engine]], Urho3D, and [[Unity (game engine)|Unity 3D]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/9SliceSprites.html|title=Unity - Manual: 9-slicing Sprites|last=Technologies|first=Unity|website=docs.unity3d.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The technique can be used to manipulate both [[Raster graphics|bitmap/raster graphics]] and [[vector graphics]]. A current implementation of the 9-slice technique is present on the [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] 3 Backgrounds and Borders spec&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/|title=CSS Backgrounds and Borders Module Level 3|last=Bos|first=Bert|last2=Etemad|first2=Elika J.|date=2014-09-09|website=www.w3.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-08|last3=Kemper|first3=Brad}}&lt;/ref&gt; by using the ''border-image'' property.

[[File:No. 5, 1948.jpg|thumb|[[Jackson Pollock]], ''[[No. 5, 1948]]'', oil on [[fiberboard]], 244 × 122 cm (96 × 48 in), private collection]]

'''Abstract expressionism''' is a post–[[World War II]] [[art movement]] in American painting, developed in New York in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Editors of Phaidon Press|title=The 20th-Century art book.|year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=London|isbn=0714835420|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first specifically American movement to achieve international influence and put [[New York City]] at the center of the western [[art world]], a role formerly filled by Paris. Although the term ''abstract expressionism'' was first applied to American art in 1946 by the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]], it had been first used in Germany in 1919 in the magazine ''[[Der Sturm]]'', regarding [[German Expressionism]]. In the United States, [[Alfred Barr]] was the first to use this term in 1929 in relation to works by [[Wassily Kandinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Barbara; "Abstract Expressionism", 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==
[[File:SMITH CUBI VI.JPG|thumb|upright|[[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]],'' [[Cubi]] VI'' (1963), [[Israel Museum]], [[Jerusalem]]. David Smith was one of the most influential American sculptors of the 20th century.]]

Technically, an important predecessor is [[surrealism]], with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]], or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[André Masson]], [[Max Ernst]], and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]]. The newer research tends to put the exile-surrealist [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in the position of the artist and theoretician who fostered the theory of the viewer-dependent possibility space through his paintings and his magazine ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]''. Paalen considered ideas of [[quantum mechanics]], as well as idiosyncratic interpretations of the totemic vision and the spatial structure of native-Indian painting from British Columbia and prepared the ground for the new spatial vision of the young American abstracts. His long essay ''Totem Art'' (1943) had considerable influence on such artists as [[Martha Graham]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Mark Rothko]] and [[Barnett Newman]].&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Neufert, ''Auf Liebe und Tod, Das Leben des Surrealisten Wolfgang Paalen'', Berlin (Parthas) 2015, S. 494ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1944 Barnett Newman tried to explain America's newest art movement and included a list of "the men in the new movement." Paalen is mentioned twice; other artists mentioned are Gottlieb, Rothko, Pollock, Hofmann, Baziotes, [[Arshile Gorky|Gorky]] and others. Motherwell is mentioned with a question mark.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett Newman Foundation, archive 18/103&lt;/ref&gt; Another important early manifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his "white writing" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the [[all-over painting|"all-over"]] look of Pollock's drip paintings.

The movement's name is derived from the combination of the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German [[expressionism|Expressionists]] with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], the [[Bauhaus]], and Synthetic [[Cubism]]. Additionally, it has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, nihilistic.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2000 p. 189-190"&gt;Shapiro, David/Cecile (2000), "Abstract Expressionism: The politics of apolitical painting." p. 189–190 In: Frascina, Francis (2000–1): ''Pollock and After: The Critical Debate''. 2nd ed. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even to work that is neither especially abstract nor expressionist. California abstract expressionist [[Jay Meuser]], who typically painted in the non-objective style, wrote about his painting ''Mare Nostrum'', "It is far better to capture the glorious spirit of the sea than to paint all of its tiny ripples." Pollock's energetic "[[action painting]]s", with their "busy" feel, are different, both technically and aesthetically, from the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]'s [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]] and the rectangles of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s [[Color Field]] paintings (which are not what would usually be called expressionist, and which Rothko denied were abstract). Yet all four artists are classified as abstract expressionists.

Abstract expressionism has many stylistic similarities to the Russian artists of the early 20th century such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Although it is true that spontaneity or the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists' works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. With artists such as [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Emma Kunz]], and later on Rothko, [[Barnett Newman]], and [[Agnes Martin]], abstract art clearly implied expression of ideas concerning the spiritual, the unconscious, and the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine de Zegher and Hendel Teicher (eds.). ''3 X Abstraction''. NY: The Drawing Center and /New Haven: Yale University Press. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Why this style gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s is a matter of debate. American [[social realism]] had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the [[Great Depression]], but also by the [[Mexican muralism|muralists]] of [[Mexico]] such as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of these painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the early forties at galleries in New York such as [[The Art of This Century Gallery]]. The [[McCarthy era]] after World War II was a time of artistic [[censorship]] in the United States, but if the subject matter were totally [[abstract art|abstract]] then it would be seen as apolitical, and therefore safe. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Guilbaut. ''How New York Stole the Idea of Modern Art'', University of Chicago Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the movement is closely associated with painting, and painters such as [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Willem de Kooning]], Jackson Pollock, and others, [[Collage|collagist]] [[Anne Ryan]] and [[sculpture|certain sculptors]] in particular were also integral to abstract expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;Marika Herskovic, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/50253062&amp;tab=holdings ''Americancan Abstract Expressionism of the 1950s An Illustrated Survey,''] (New York School Press, 2003.) {{ISBN|0-9677994-1-4}} pp12–13&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], and his wife [[Dorothy Dehner]], [[Herbert Ferber]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Ibram Lassaw]], [[Theodore Roszak (artist)|Theodore Roszak]], [[Phillip Pavia]], [[Mary Callery]], Richard Stankiewicz, [[Louise Bourgeois]], and [[Louise Nevelson]] in particular were some of the sculptors considered as being important members of the movement. In addition, the artists [[David Hare (artist)|David Hare]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[James Rosati]], [[Mark di Suvero]], and sculptors [[Richard Lippold]], Raoul Hague, [[George Rickey]], [[Reuben Nakian]], and even [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Seymour Lipton]], [[Joseph Cornell]], and several others&lt;ref name="Marika Herskovic 2000. p.11-12"&gt;Marika Herskovic, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/50666793&amp;tab=holdings ''New York School Abstract Expressionists Artists Choice by Artists''] (New York School Press, 2000.) {{ISBN|0-9677994-0-6}} p.11–12&lt;/ref&gt; were integral parts of the abstract expressionist movement. Many of the sculptors listed participated in the [[Ninth Street Show]],&lt;ref name="Marika Herskovic 2000. p.11-12" /&gt; a famous exhibition curated by [[Leo Castelli]] on East Ninth Street in New York City in 1951. Besides the painters and sculptors of the period the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of abstract expressionism also generated a number of supportive poets, including [[Frank O'Hara]] and photographers such as [[Aaron Siskind]] and [[Fred McDarrah]], (whose book ''The Artist's World in Pictures'' documented the New York School during the 1950s), and filmmakers—notably [[Robert Frank]]—as well.

Although the abstract expressionist school spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and the San Francisco Bay area of California.

== Art critics of the post–World War II era ==


{{quote|At a certain moment the canvas began to appear to one American painter after another as an arena in which to act. What was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event.|[[Harold Rosenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;Abstract Expressionism, by Barbara Hess, Taschen, 2005, back cover&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1940s there were not only few galleries ([[The Art of This Century]], [[Pierre Matisse]] Gallery, [[Julien Levy Gallery]] and a few others) but also few critics who were willing to follow the work of the New York Vanguard.
There were also a few artists with a literary background, among them [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Barnett Newman]], who functioned as critics as well.

While New York and the world were yet unfamiliar with the New York [[avant-garde]] by the late 1940s, most of the artists who have become household names today had their well-established patron critics: [[Clement Greenberg]] advocated [[Jackson Pollock]] and the [[Color Field|color field]] painters like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Hans Hofmann]]; [[Harold Rosenberg]] seemed to prefer the action painters such as [[Willem de Kooning]] and [[Franz Kline]], as well as the seminal paintings of [[Arshile Gorky]]; Thomas B. Hess, the managing editor of ''[[ARTnews]]'', championed [[Willem de Kooning]].

The new critics elevated their protégés by casting other artists as "followers"&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Hess, "Willem de Kooning", George Braziller, Inc. New York, 1959 p.13&lt;/ref&gt; or ignoring those who did not serve their promotional goal.

In 1958, [[Mark Tobey]] became the first American painter since [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] (1895) to win top prize at the [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref&gt;Tomkins, Calvin. ''Off the Wall: A Portrait of Robert Rauschenberg'' [Deckle Edge] [Paperback], p. 5. Publisher: Picador; Revised and Updated edition (November 29, 2005) {{ISBN|0-312-42585-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Newman-Onement 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Barnett Newman]], ''Onement 1,'' 1948. During the 1940s Barnett Newman wrote several articles about the new American painting.]]

[[Barnett Newman]], a late member of the [[The Art of This Century Gallery|Uptown Group]], wrote catalogue forewords and reviews, and by the late 1940s became an exhibiting artist at Betty Parsons Gallery. His first solo show was in 1948. Soon after his first exhibition, Barnett Newman remarked in one of the Artists' Sessions at Studio 35: "We are in the process of making the world, to a certain extent, in our own image."&lt;ref&gt;''Barnett Newman Selected Writings and Interviews'', (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, pp. 240–241, [[University of California Press]], 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing his writing skills, Newman fought every step of the way to reinforce his newly established image as an artist and to promote his work. An example is his letter on April 9, 1955, "Letter to Sidney Janis: — it is true that Rothko talks the fighter. He fights, however, to submit to the philistine world. My struggle against bourgeois society has involved the total rejection of it."&lt;ref&gt;''Barnett Newman Selected Writings Interviews'', p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strangely the person thought to have had most to do with the promotion of this style was a New York Trotskyist; [[Clement Greenberg]]. As long-time art critic for the ''[[Partisan Review]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]'', he became an early and literate proponent of abstract expressionism. The well-heeled artist [[Robert Motherwell]] joined Greenberg in promoting a style that fit the political climate and the intellectual rebelliousness of the era.

Clement Greenberg proclaimed abstract expressionism and Jackson Pollock in particular as the epitome of aesthetic value. He supported Pollock's work on formalistic grounds as simply the best painting of its day and the culmination of an art tradition going back via [[Cubism]] and [[Cézanne]] to [[Monet]], in which painting became ever-'purer' and more concentrated in what was 'essential' to it, the making of marks on a flat surface.&lt;ref&gt;Clement Greenberg, "Art and Culture Critical essays", ("The Crisis of the Easel Picture"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.: 154–57&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson Pollock's work has always polarised critics. [[Harold Rosenberg]] spoke of the transformation of painting into an existential drama in Pollock's work, in which "what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event". "The big moment came when it was decided to paint 'just to paint'. The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value—political, aesthetic, moral."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Rosenberg, ''The Tradition of the New'', Chapter 2, "The American Action Painter", pp.23–39&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most vocal critics of abstract expressionism at the time was ''[[The New York Times]]'' art critic [[John Canaday]]. [[Meyer Schapiro]] and [[Leo Steinberg]] along with Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg were important art historians of the post-war era who voiced support for abstract expressionism. During the early-to-mid-sixties younger art critics [[Michael Fried]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], and [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] added considerable insights into the critical dialectic that continues to grow around abstract expressionism.

== History ==

=== World War II and the Post-War period ===

[[File:'Symphony No. 1, The Transcendental', oil on canvas painting by Richard Pousette-Dart, 1941-42, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Pousette-Dart]], ''Symphony No. 1, The Transcendental,'' 1941–42]]

During the period leading up to and during [[World War II]], modernist artists, writers, and poets, as well as important collectors and dealers, fled Europe and the onslaught of the Nazis for safe haven in the United States. Many of those who didn't flee perished. Among the artists and collectors who arrived in New York during the war (some with help from [[Varian Fry]]) were [[Hans Namuth]], [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Peggy Guggenheim]], [[Leo Castelli]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[André Masson]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[André Breton]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Fernand Léger]], and [[Piet Mondrian]]. A few artists, notably [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], and [[Pierre Bonnard]] remained in France and survived.

The post-war period left the capitals of Europe in upheaval, with an urgency to economically and physically rebuild and to politically regroup. In Paris, formerly the center of European culture and capital of the art world, the climate for art was a disaster, and New York replaced Paris as the new center of the art world. In Europe after the war there was the continuation of [[Surrealism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada]], and the works of [[Matisse]]. Also in Europe, [[Outsider art|Art brut]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L’Art brut préféré aux arts culturels'' [1949](=engl in: ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art &amp; Text'', No. 27, 1987, p. 31-33)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] or [[Tachisme]] (the European equivalent to abstract expressionism) took hold of the newest generation. [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Yves Klein]], [[Pierre Soulages]] and [[Jean Messagier]], among others are considered important figures in post-war European painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/books/OL22161138M/Younger_European_painters_a_selection. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, ''Younger European painters: a selection'', exhibition catalogue, 2 December 1953 – 21 February 1954]&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, a new generation of American artists began to emerge and to dominate the world stage, and they were called ''Abstract Expressionists''.

==== Gorky, Hofmann, and Graham ====

[[File:Gorky-The-Liver.jpg|thumb|left|[[Arshile Gorky]], ''The Liver is the Cock's Comb'' (1944), oil on canvas, 73{{fraction|1|4}} × 98" (186 × 249 cm) [[Albright–Knox Art Gallery]], [[Buffalo, New York]]. Gorky was an [[Armenians|Armenian]]-born [[United States|American]] painter who had a seminal influence on abstract expressionism. De Kooning said: "I met a lot of artists — but then I met Gorky... He had an extraordinary gift for hitting the nail on the head; remarkable. So I immediately attached myself to him and we became very good friends."&lt;ref&gt;''Willem de Kooning'' (1969) by Thomas B. Hess&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American abstract expressionism, a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Surrealism]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Cubism]], [[Fauvism]], and early Modernism via great teachers in America such as [[Hans Hofmann]] from Germany and [[John D. Graham]] from Ukraine. Graham's influence on American art during the early 1940s was particularly visible in the work of [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Richard Pousette-Dart]] among others. Gorky's contributions to American and world art are difficult to overestimate. His work as [[lyrical abstraction]]&lt;ref name =dorment&gt;Dorment, Richard.

Hans Hofmann in particular as teacher, mentor, and artist was both important and influential to the development and success of abstract expressionism in the United States. Among Hofmann's protégés was [[Clement Greenberg]], who became an enormously influential voice for American painting, and among his students was [[Lee Krasner]], who introduced her teacher, Hofmann, to her husband, Jackson Pollock.



==== Pollock and Abstract influences ====

During the late 1940s, Jackson Pollock's radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all [[Contemporary art]] that followed him. To some extent, Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like [[Pablo Picasso]]'s innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near the turn of the century via [[Cubism]] and constructed sculpture, with influences as disparate as [[Navajo people|Navaho]] [[sand painting]]s, surrealism, Jungian analysis, and Mexican mural art,&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi, Richard, et al., ''Introducing Postmodernism,'' Ikon Books, Cambridge, United Kingdom, 2003, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock redefined what it was to produce art. His move away from easel painting and conventionality was a liberating signal to the artists of his era and to all that came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process—the placing of unstretched raw [[canvas]] on the floor where it could be attacked from all four sides using artist materials and industrial materials; linear skeins of paint dripped and thrown; drawing, staining, brushing; imagery and non-imagery—essentially took art-making beyond any prior boundary. Abstract expressionism in general expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities that artists had available for the creation of new works of art.

The other abstract expressionists followed Pollock's breakthrough with new breakthroughs of their own. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Peter Voulkos]], and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them. The new [[art movements]] of the 1960s essentially followed the lead of abstract expressionism and in particular the innovations of Pollock, De Kooning, Rothko, Hofmann, Reinhardt, and Newman. The radical Anti-Formalist movements of the 1960s and 1970s including [[Fluxus]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[Conceptual art]], and the [[feminist art movement]] can be traced to the innovations of abstract expressionism. Rereadings into abstract art, done by art historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]],&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, Linda, Ch.1 in: ''Women Artists at the Millennium'' (edited by C. Armstrong and C. de Zegher) MIT Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Griselda Pollock]]&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, Griselda, ''Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive''. Routledge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Catherine de Zegher]]&lt;ref&gt;De Zegher, Catherine, and Teicher, Hendel (eds.), ''3 X Abstraction''. New Haven: Yale University Press. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; critically shows, however, that pioneer women artists who have produced major innovations in modern art had been ignored by the official accounts of its history, but finally began to achieve long overdue recognition in the wake of the abstract expressionist movement of the 1940s and 1950s. Abstract expressionism emerged as a major art movement in New York City during the 1950s and thereafter several leading art galleries began to include the abstract expressionists in exhibitions and as regulars in their rosters. Some of those prominent 'uptown' galleries included: the [[Charles Egan Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xPBPAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22charles+egan+gallery%22+abstract&amp;dq=%22charles+egan+gallery%22+abstract&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-CluVdSYL4b5yASbmYCgBg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw|title=George McNeil|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sidney Janis|Sidney Janis Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0uYCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=%22janis+gallery%22+abstract&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QypuVfDEBtKTyAS66IOQBA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22janis%20gallery%22%20abstract&amp;f=false|title=Janis Gallery abstract|work=New York Magazine|accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Betty Parsons Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNCJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=%22betty+parsons+gallery%22+abstract&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aCpuVYq4EsuxyASNjoGACA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22betty%20parsons%20gallery%22%20abstract&amp;f=false|title=The Queer Encyclopedia of the Visual Arts|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Kootz Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YgALtJ2GKIUC&amp;pg=PA302&amp;dq=%22kootz+gallery%22+abstract&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mypuVY-QAdX_yQTHyIOoDw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kootz%20gallery%22%20abstract&amp;f=false|title=New York Modern|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tibor de Nagy Gallery]], the [[Stable Gallery]], the [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] as well as others; and several downtown galleries known at the time as the [[Tenth Street galleries]] exhibited many emerging younger artists working in the abstract expressionist vein.

==== Action painting ====

Action painting was a style widespread from the 1940s until the early 1960s, and is closely associated with abstract expressionism (some critics have used the terms [[action painting]] and abstract expressionism interchangeably). A comparison is often drawn between the American action painting and the French [[tachisme]].

The term was coined by the American critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in 1952&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=9798
| title = ''The American Action Painters''

| publisher = poetrymagazines.org.uk
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and signaled a major shift in the aesthetic perspective of [[New York School (art)|New York School]] painters and critics. According to Rosenberg the canvas was "an arena in which to act". While abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Franz Kline]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] had long been outspoken in their view of a painting as an arena within which to come to terms with the act of creation, earlier critics sympathetic to their cause, like [[Clement Greenberg]], focused on their works' "objectness." To Greenberg, it was the physicality of the paintings' clotted and oil-caked surfaces that was the key to understanding them as documents of the artists' [[Existentialism|existential]] struggle.

[[File:'Boon' oil on canvas painting by James Brooks, 1957, Tate Gallery.jpg|thumb|''Boon'' by [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], 1957, [[Tate Gallery]]]]
Rosenberg's critique shifted the emphasis from the object to the struggle itself, with the finished painting being only the physical manifestation, a kind of residue, of the actual work of art, which was in the act or process of the painting's creation. This spontaneous activity was the "action" of the painter, through arm and wrist movement, [[painterly]] gestures, brushstrokes, thrown paint, splashed, stained, scumbled and dripped. The painter would sometimes let the paint drip onto the canvas, while rhythmically dancing, or even standing in the canvas, sometimes letting the paint fall according to the subconscious mind, thus letting the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] part of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] assert and express itself. All this, however, is difficult to explain or interpret because it is a supposed [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] manifestation of the act of pure creation.&lt;ref&gt;based (very) loosely on a lecture by Fred Orton at the Uni of Leeds and H. Geldzahler, ''New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940–1970, NY 1969''&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the term abstract expressionism is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic [[action painting]]s, with their "busy" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. ''Woman V'' is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, ''Woman I,'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio soon afterwards and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; ''Woman II'', collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, ''[[Woman III]],'' [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]], ''Woman IV,'' [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He may have finished work on ''Woman I'' by the end of June, or possibly as late as November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&amp;BioArtistIRN=25281&amp;MnuID=2&amp;GalID=1|title=International Paintings and Sculpture - Woman V|work=nga.gov.au|accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]].

Another important artist is [[Franz Kline]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/1/81 Painting Number 2 at MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://hyperallergic.com/66831/painting-at-the-speed-of-sight-franz-klines-rapid-transit/ Painting at the Speed of Light]&lt;/ref&gt;As with Jackson Pollock and other abstract expressionists, Kline was labelled an "[[Action Painting|action painter]] because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas; as demonstrated by his painting ''Number 2'' (1954). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/art-history-definition-action-painting-183188|title=Art History Definition: Action Painting|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/1/81 Franz Kline, ''Number 2'' (1954), Museum of Modern Art, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0520050150 Rudolf Arnheim, ''The Power of the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual Arts''], University of California Press, 1983, pp. 71-72, {{ISBN|0520050150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automatic writing was an important vehicle for action painters [[Franz Kline]] (in his black and white paintings), Jackson Pollock, Mark Tobey and [[Cy Twombly]], who used gesture, surface, and line to create calligraphic, linear symbols and skeins that resemble language, and resonate as powerful manifestations from the [[Collective unconscious]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://arthistoryunstuffed.com/abstract-expressionism-redefining-art-part-one/ Jeanne Willette, abstract expressionism, redefining art, part one]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/abex/hd_abex.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, Abstract Expressionism]&lt;/ref&gt;[[Robert Motherwell]] in his ''Elegy to the Spanish Republic'' series also painted powerful black and white paintings using gesture, surface and symbol evoking powerful emotional charges.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/489403 Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79007 MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, other action painters, notably [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Joan Mitchell]], and [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], used imagery via either abstract landscape or as expressionistic visions of the figure to articulate their highly personal and powerful evocations. James Brooks' paintings were particularly poetic and highly prescient in relationship to [[Lyrical Abstraction]] that became prominent in the late 1960s and the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction'', exhibition: April 5 through June 7, 1970, ''Statement of the exhibition''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both Hans Hofmann and [[Robert Motherwell]] can be comfortably described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and [[Color field|Color field painting]]. In the 1940s [[Richard Pousette-Dart]]'s tightly constructed imagery often depended upon themes of mythology and mysticism; as did the paintings of [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and Jackson Pollock in that decade as well.

[[Color Field painting]] initially referred to a particular type of abstract expressionism, especially the work of [[Mark Rothko]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Ad Reinhardt]] and several series of paintings by [[Joan Miró]]. [[Art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]] perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from [[Action painting]]. The Color Field painters sought to rid their art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Mark Tobey]], and especially [[Ad Reinhardt]] and [[Barnett Newman]], whose masterpiece ''[[Vir heroicus sublimis]]'' is in the collection of [[MoMA]], used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery, in the case of Rothko and Gottlieb sometimes using symbol and sign as replacement of imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MoMA Learning|title=What is Abstract Expressionism: Mark Rothko|url=https://education.moma.org/moma/learningresources/cms_page/view/366521|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image.

In distinction to the emotional energy and gestural surface marks of abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], the Color Field painters initially appeared to be cool and austere, effacing the individual mark in favor of large, flat areas of color, which these artists considered to be the essential nature of visual abstraction, along with the actual shape of the canvas, which later in the 1960s [[Frank Stella]] in particular achieved in unusual ways with combinations of curved and straight edges. However Color Field painting has proven to be both sensual and deeply expressive albeit in a different way from gestural abstract expressionism.

Although abstract expressionism spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and California, especially in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], and the [[San Francisco Bay area]]. Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics, including the use of large canvases, an "all-over" approach, in which the whole canvas is treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). The canvas as the ''arena'' became a credo of [[Action painting]], while the [[Picture plane#Integrity of the picture plane|''integrity of the picture plane'']] became a credo of the [[Color field]] painters. Younger artists began exhibiting their abstract expressionist related paintings during the 1950s as well including [[Alfred Leslie]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Michael Goldberg]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Robert Goodnough]] among others.

Although Pollock is closely associated with [[Action Painting]] because of his style, technique, and his painterly ''touch'' and his physical application of paint, art critics have likened Pollock to both Action painting and color field painting. Another critical view advanced by Clement Greenberg connects Pollock's allover canvasses to the large-scale [[Water Lilies]] of [[Claude Monet]] done during the 1920s. Greenberg, art critic [[Michael Fried]], and others have observed that the overall feeling in Pollock's most famous works – his ''drip'' paintings – read as vast fields of built-up linear elements often reading as vast complexes of similar valued paint skeins that read as all over fields of color and drawing, and are related to the mural-sized late Monets that are constructed of many passages of close valued brushed and scumbled marks that also read as close valued fields of color and drawing that Monet used in building his picture surfaces. Pollock's use of all-over composition lend a philosophical and a physical connection to the way the color field painters like Newman, Rothko and Still construct their unbroken and in Still's case broken surfaces. In several paintings that Pollock painted after his classic ''drip'' painting period of 1947–1950, he used the technique of staining fluid oil paint and house paint into raw canvas. During 1951 he produced a series of semi-figurative black stain paintings, and in 1952 he produced stain paintings using color. In his November 1952 exhibition at the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery in New York City Pollock showed ''Number 12, 1952'', a large, masterful stain painting that resembles a brightly colored stained landscape (with an overlay of broadly dripped dark paint); the painting was acquired from the exhibition by [[Nelson Rockefeller]] for his personal collection. In 1960 the painting was severely damaged by fire in the Governors Mansion in Albany that also severely damaged an Arshile Gorky painting and several other works in the Rockefeller collection. However, by 1999 it had been restored and was installed in Albany Mall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B-QCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=1961+Fire+damages+art+collection+of++Governor+Rockefellers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Puraoeksco&amp;sig=kXNGISm1LkNM53NlzW4ZePgUlAY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=efvDTfSeMYHt0gGvjtn2Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false August 16, 1976 NY Magazine, p.66] Retrieved May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ogs.ny.gov/esp/CT/History.asp Pollock #12 1952 at NY State Mall project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313223525/http://ogs.ny.gov/esp/CT/History.asp |date=March 13, 2014 }} Retrieved May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Arshile Gorky]] is considered to be one of the founding fathers of abstract expressionism and a [[surrealist]], he was also one of the first painters of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] who used the technique of ''staining.'' Gorky created broad fields of vivid, open, unbroken color that he used in many of his paintings as ''grounds.'' In Gorky's most effective and accomplished paintings between the years 1941–1948, he consistently used intense stained fields of color, often letting the paint run and drip, under and around his familiar lexicon of organic and biomorphic shapes and delicate lines. Another abstract expressionist whose works in the 1940s call to mind the stain paintings of the 1960s and the 1970s is [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]]. Brooks regularly used stain as a technique in his paintings from the late 1940s. Brooks began diluting his [[oil paint]] in order to have fluid colors with which to pour and drip and stain into the mostly raw canvas that he used. These works often combined [[calligraphy]] and abstract shapes. During the final three decades of his career, [[Sam Francis]]' style of large-scale bright abstract expressionism was closely associated with Color field painting. His paintings straddled both camps within the abstract expressionist rubric, [[Action painting]] and Color Field painting.

Having seen [[Jackson Pollock]]'s 1951 paintings of thinned black oil paint stained into raw canvas, [[Helen Frankenthaler]] began to produce ''stain paintings'' in varied oil colors on raw canvas in 1952. Her most famous painting from that period is ''Mountains and Sea''. She is one of the originators of the Color Field movement that emerged in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87871332 'Color Field' Artists Found a Different Way] Retrieved August 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Frankenthaler also studied with [[Hans Hofmann]].

Hofmann's paintings are a symphony of color as seen in ''The Gate,'' 1959–1960. Hofmann was renowned not only as an artist but also as a teacher of art, both in his native Germany and later in the U.S. Hans Hofmann, who came to the United States from Germany in the early 1930s, brought with him the legacy of [[Modernism]]. Hofmann was a young artist working in [[Paris]] who painted there before [[World War I]]. Hofmann worked in Paris with [[Robert Delaunay]], and he knew firsthand the innovative work of both [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. Matisse's work had an enormous influence on him, and on his understanding of the expressive language of color and the potentiality of abstraction. Hofmann was one of the first theorists of color field painting, and his theories were influential to artists and to critics, particularly to Clement Greenberg, as well as to others during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1953 [[Morris Louis]] and [[Kenneth Noland]] were both profoundly influenced by [[Helen Frankenthaler]]'s stain paintings after visiting her studio in [[New York City]]. Returning to [[Washington, DC.]], they began to produce the major works that created the ''color field movement'' in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="Fenton1"&gt;Fenton, Terry.

It also was one of the first stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which the stain technique was used, perhaps the first one.

In [[Abstract art|abstract painting]] during the 1950s and 1960s, several new directions, like the [[Hard-edge painting]] exemplified by [[John McLaughlin (artist)|John McLaughlin]], emerged. Meanwhile, as a reaction against the subjectivism of abstract expressionism, other forms of [[Geometric abstraction]] began to appear in artist studios and in radical [[avant-garde]] circles. [[Clement Greenberg]] became the voice of ''Post-painterly abstraction;'' by curating an influential exhibition of new painting that toured important art museums throughout the United States in 1964.

== Abstract expressionism and the Cold War ==

Since the mid-1970s it has been argued by [[historical revisionism|revisionist historians]] that the style attracted the attention, in the early 1950s, of the [[CIA]], who saw it as representative of the USA as a haven of free thought and free markets, as well as a challenge to both the [[socialist realist]] styles prevalent in [[communism|communist]] nations and the dominance of the European art markets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html CIA and AbEx] Retrieved November 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The book by [[Frances Stonor Saunders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/CIAcultCW.html |title=Ratical.org |publisher=Ratical.org |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Cultural Cold War—The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/oclc/43114251?loc=#tabs |title=Worldcatlibraries.org |publisher=Worldcatlibraries.org |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (published in the UK as ''Who Paid the Piper?: CIA and the Cultural Cold War'') details how the CIA financed and organized the promotion of American abstract expressionists as part of [[cultural imperialism]] via the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]] from 1950 to 1967. Notably Robert Motherwell's series ''Elegy to the Spanish Republic'' addressed some of those political issues. [[Tom Braden]], founding chief of the CIA's [[International Organizations Division]] (IOD) and ex-executive secretary of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] said in an interview, "I think it was the most important division that the agency had, and I think that it played an enormous role in the Cold War."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html Modern Art was a CIA 'Weapon'] Retrieved September 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Against this revisionist tradition, an essay by [[Michael Kimmelman]], chief art critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'', called ''Revisiting the Revisionists: The Modern, Its Critics and the Cold War'', argues that much of this information (as well as the revisionists' interpretation of it) concerning what was happening on the American art scene during the 1940s and 50s is flatly false, or at best (contrary to the revisionists' avowed historiographic principles) decontextualized.&lt;ref name=kimmelman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kimmelman|first1=Michael|last2=Frascina|first2=Francis, ed.|title=Pollock and After: The Critical Debate|chapter=Revisiting the Revisionists: The Modern, Its Critics and the Cold War|date=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415228664|pages=294–306|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNzRUNbKKA4C&amp;pg=PA294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other books on the subject include ''Art in the Cold War'' by Christine Lindey, which also describes the art of the Soviet Union at the same time; and ''Pollock and After'' edited by Francis Frascina, which reprinted the Kimmelman article.

[[Canadians|Canadian]] painter [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]] (1923–2002), a member of the Montreal-based surrealist-inspired group [[Les Automatistes]], helped introduce a related style of [[abstract impressionism]] to the Parisian art world from 1949. [[Michel Tapié]]'s groundbreaking book, ''Un Art Autre'' (1952), was also enormously influential in this regard. Tapié was also a curator and exhibition organizer who promoted the works of Pollock and Hans Hofmann in Europe. By the 1960s, the movement's initial affect had been assimilated, yet its methods and proponents remained highly influential in art, affecting profoundly the work of many artists who followed. Abstract expressionism preceded [[Tachisme]], [[Color Field painting]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Fluxus]], [[Pop Art]], [[Minimalism]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Neo-expressionism]], and the other movements of the sixties and seventies and it influenced all those later movements that evolved. Movements which were direct responses to, and rebellions against abstract expressionism began with [[Hard-edge painting]] ([[Frank Stella]], [[Robert Indiana]] and others) and [[Pop Art|Pop artists]], notably [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] who achieved prominence in the US, accompanied by [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] in Britain. [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] in the US formed a bridge between abstract expressionism and Pop art. [[Minimalism]] was exemplified by artists such as [[Donald Judd]], [[Robert Mangold]] and [[Agnes Martin]].

However, many painters, such as [[Jules Olitski]], [[Joan Mitchell]] and [[Antoni Tàpies]] continued to work in the abstract expressionist style for many years, extending and expanding its visual and philosophical implications, as many abstract artists continue to do today, in styles described as [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Neo-expressionism|Neo-expressionist]] and others.

In the years after World War II, a group of New York artists started one of the first true schools of artists in America, bringing about a new era in American artwork: abstract expressionism. This led to the American art boom that brought about styles such as [[Pop Art]]. This also helped to make [[New York City|New York]] into a cultural and artistic hub.&lt;ref name="New York and Abstract Expressionism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Abstract Expressionist New York|url=http://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1085?locale=en|publisher=MoMA|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ethics]] and [[governance]], '''accountability''' is answerability, [[blameworthiness]], [[legal liability|liability]], and the expectation of account-giving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dykstra|first=Clarence A.|date=February 1938|title=The Quest for Responsibility|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–25|doi=10.2307/1949761|publisher=The American Political Science Review, Vol. 33, No. 1|jstor=1949761}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an aspect of [[governance]], it has been central to discussions related to problems in the [[public sector]], [[nonprofit]] and private ([[corporate]]) and individual contexts. In leadership roles,&lt;ref&gt;Williams,  Reyes(2006) Leadership accountability in a globalizing world. London: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; accountability is the acknowledgment and assumption of responsibility for actions, [[Product (business)|products]], decisions, and policies including the [[Administration (business)|administration]], governance, and implementation within the scope of the role or employment position and encompassing the obligation to report, explain and be answerable for resulting consequences.

In governance, accountability has expanded beyond the basic definition of "being called to account for one's actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mulgan|first=Richard |year=2000|title='Accountability': An Ever-Expanding Concept?|url=|journal=[[Public Administration (journal)|Public Administration]]|volume=78|issue=3|pages=555–573|doi=10.1111/1467-9299.00218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinclair|first=Amanda |year=1995|title=The Chameleon of Accountability: Forms and Discourses|url=|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society |volume=20|issue=2/3|pages=219–237|doi=10.1016/0361-3682(93)E0003-Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is frequently described as an account-giving relationship between individuals, e.g. "A is accountable to B when A is obliged to inform B about A's (past or future) actions and decisions, to justify them, and to suffer punishment in the case of eventual misconduct".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schedler|first=Andreas|editor=Andreas Schedler |editor2=Larry Diamond |editor3=Marc F. Plattner|authorlink=|title=The Self-Restraining State: Power and Accountability in New Democracies|chapter=Conceptualizing Accountability|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|location=London|year=1999|isbn=1-55587-773-7|pages=13–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accountability cannot exist without proper accounting practices; in other words, an absence of accounting means an absence of accountability.

Accountability is an element of a [[Responsibility assignment matrix|RACI]] to indicate who is ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, and the one who delegates the work to those responsible.

There are various reasons (legitimate or excuses) why accountability fails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Accountable Partner – Why You Fail - Katy Christian Magazine|url = http://katychristianmagazine.com/2015/12/accountable-partner-why-you-fail/|website = Katy Christian Magazine|access-date = 2016-02-13|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and etymology==
"Accountability" stems from late Latin ''accomptare'' (to account), a prefixed form of ''computare'' (to calculate), which in turn derived from ''putare'' (to reckon).&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary 2nd Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;
While the word itself does not appear in English until its use in 13th century Norman England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dubnick|first=Melvin|editor=Charles Sampford |editor2=Noel Preston |editor3=C.

==Types==
Bruce Stone, O.P. Dwivedi, and Joseph G. Jabbra list 8 types of accountability, namely: moral, administrative, political, managerial, market, legal/judicial, constituency relation, and professional.&lt;ref&gt;Jabbra, J. G. and Dwivedi, 0. P. (eds.), ''Public Service Accountability: A Comparative Perspective'', Kumarian Press, Hartford, CT, 1989, {{ISBN|0-7837-7581-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leadership accountability]] cross cuts many of these distinctions.

===Political===
{{Anchor|Political accountability}}
Political accountability is the accountability of the [[government]], [[civil servants]] and [[politicians]] to the public and to legislative bodies such as a [[congress]] or a [[parliament]].

Hirschman makes substantial contributions to accountability theory, positing exit or voice as pivotal accountability mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exit, Voice, and Loyalty: Responses to Decline in Firms, Organizations, and States.|last=Hirschman|first=Albert O.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1970|isbn=9780674276505|location=Cambridge, Mass|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the governor and governed (i.e., [autonomous (auto) - dependent (dep)], [auto-auto], [dep-dep], [dep-auto] ) functions such that the prospect of citizen exit can, not only disciplines ex ante, but also ex post if the state is dependent on the citizens. The literature connects this disposition of autonomy or dependence to its [[fiscal capacity]]. States that are most responsive adjust to exit or voice. Clark &amp; Golder model the dynamics of Hirschman's theory and elaborate important aspects like those that operationalize loyalty as an active choice.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, William Roberts, Matt Golder, and Sona N. Golder. 2013. “Power and politics: insights from an exit, voice, and loyalty game.” Unpublished manuscript, University of Michigan and Pennsylvania State University.&lt;/ref&gt; Exit, voice, and loyalty will be expressed in different ways under differing regimes and given the relevant assumptions. All three of these sufficiently broad categories present ways and means of holding the state accountable.

[[Recall election]]s can be used to revoke the office of an elected official. Generally, however, voters do not have any direct way of holding elected representatives to account during the [[term of office|term]] for which they have been elected. Additionally, some officials and legislators may be appointed rather than elected. [[Constitution]], or [[statute]], can empower a [[legislative body]] to hold their own members, the government, and government bodies to account. This can be through holding an internal or independent [[inquiry]]. Inquiries are usually held in response to an allegation of misconduct or corruption. The powers, procedures and sanctions vary from country to country. The legislature may have the power to [[impeach]] the individual, remove them, or suspend them from office for a period of time. The accused person might also decide to [[resign]] before trial. [[Impeachment in the United States]] has been used both for elected representatives and other civil offices, such as [[United States district court|district court]] [[judge]]s.

In parliamentary systems, the government relies on the support or parliament, which gives parliament power to hold the government to account. For example, some parliaments can pass a [[vote of no confidence]] in the government.

Belsky et al. point out, whereas, under more democratic governance accountability is built into the institution of the state by a habit of regular elections, accountability in autocratic regimes &lt;ref&gt;Besley, Timothy and Masayuki Kudamatsu. 2007. “[http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/3764/1/Making_Autocracy_Work.pdf Making Autocracy Work].” Working paper.&lt;/ref&gt; relies on a selectorate; a group that legitimizes or delegitimizes the autocrats powers according to [[selectorate theory]]. The primary mechanism at a selectorate's disposal is deposition, which is a form of exit. Beyond that institutions can act as credible restraints on autocracy as well.

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] found that empowering citizens in developing countries to be able to hold their domestic governments to account was incredibly complex in practice. However, by developing explicit processes that generate change from individuals, groups or communities ([[Theories of Change]]), and by fusing political economy analysis and [[outcome mapping]] tools, the complex state-citizen dynamics can be better understood. As such, more effective ways to achieve outcomes can hence be generated.&lt;ref&gt;Tembo, F., March 2012, [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=6318&amp;title=state-accountability-citizen-voice-mwananchi Citizen voice and state accountability: towards theories of change that embrace contextual dynamics] ''Overseas Development Institute'', retrieved 23 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at the International Budget Partnership (IBP) found that civil society organizations play an important role in achieving accountability outcomes. The IBP case studies showed that CSOs can have an impact in a broad array of political and economic contexts. The researchers concluded that CSOs are most effective when they draw in a broad web of actors from across the accountability system, including the media, auditors, donors, the legislature, executive insiders, and political parties.&lt;ref&gt;van Zyl, Albert, October 2013, [http://internationalbudget.org/wp-content/uploads/CSO-transparency-and-accountability-Governance-HEC-conference.pdf Greasing the Wheels of the Accountability System: How Civil Society Organizations Close the Gap between Transparency and Accountability], ''International Budget Partnership'', retrieved 1 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical===
{{See also|Social accounting|Environmental accounting}}

Within an organization, the principles and practices of ethical accountability aim to improve both the internal standard of individual and group conduct as well as external factors, such as sustainable economic and ecologic strategies. Also, ethical accountability plays a progressively important role in academic fields, such as laboratory experiments and field research. Debates around the practice of ethical accountability on the part of researchers in the social field – whether professional or others – have been thoroughly explored by Norma R.A. Romm in her work on Accountability in Social Research,&lt;ref name=romm&gt;{{cite book|last=Romm|first=Norma R.A.|title=Accountability in Social Research|year=2001|publisher=Klower Academic|location=New York|isbn=978-0-306-46564-2|url=https://www.springer.com/social+sciences/book/978-0-306-46564-2?detailsPage=reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; including her book on New Racism: Revisiting Researcher Accountabilities, reviewed by Carole Truman in the journal Sociological Research Online.&lt;ref name=truman&gt;{{cite web|last=Truman|first=Carole|title=Review of New Racism: Revisiting Researcher Accountabilities|url=http://www.socresonline.org.uk/16/2/reviews/3.html|publisher=Sociological Research Online|accessdate=27 August 2012|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here it is suggested that researcher accountability implies that researchers are cognizant of, and take some responsibility for, the potential impact of their ways of doing research – and of writing it up – on the social fields of which the research is part. That is, accountability is linked to considering carefully, and being open to challenge in relation to, one's choices concerning how research agendas are framed and the styles in which write-ups of research "results" are created.

===Administrative===
Internal rules and norms as well as some independent commission are mechanisms to hold civil servants within the administration of government accountable. Within department or ministry, firstly, behavior is bound by rules and regulations; secondly, civil servants are subordinates in a hierarchy and accountable to superiors. Nonetheless, there are independent "watchdog" units to scrutinize and hold departments accountable; legitimacy of these commissions is built upon their independence, as it avoids any conflicts of interests.
The accountability is defined as "an element which is part of a unique responsibility and which represents an obligation of an actor to achieve the goal, or to perform the procedure of a task, and the justification that it is done to someone else, under threat of sanction".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite conference|author=Feltus C. |title=Aligning Access Rights to Governance Needs with the Responsibility MetaModel (ReMMo) in the Frame of Enterprise Architecture |date=2011 |url=http://dial.academielouvain.be/handle/boreal:144013 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724221935/http://dial.academielouvain.be/handle/boreal%3A144013 |archivedate=24 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security ===
{{Anchor|Security accountability}}
The traceability of actions performed on a system to a specific system entity (user, process, device). For example, the use of unique user identification and authentication supports accountability; the use of shared [[user ID]]s and [[password]]s destroys accountability.

===Individuals within organizations===
Because many different individuals in large organizations contribute in many ways to the decisions and policies, it is difficult even in principle to identify who should be accountable for the results. This is what is known, following Thompson, as the problem of many hands.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dennis (2005). “The Problem of Many Hands” in ''Restoring Responsibility: Ethics in Government, Business and Healthcare''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 33-49. {{ISBN|978-0521547222}}&lt;/ref&gt; It creates a dilemma for accountability. If individuals are held accountable or responsible, individuals who could not have prevented the results are either unfairly punished, or they "take responsibility" in a symbolic ritual without suffering any consequences.  If only organizations are held accountable, then all individuals in the organization are equally blameworthy or all are excused. Various solutions have been proposed.  One is to broaden the criteria for individual responsibility so that individuals are held accountable for not anticipating failures in the organization. Another solution, recently proposed by Thompson, is to hold individuals accountable for the design of the organization, both retrospectively and prospectively.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dennis F. (2014). "Responsibility for Failures of Government: The Problem of Many Hands," ''American Review of Public Administration'' '''44''' (3): 259–273.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constituency relations ===
Within this perspective, a particular agency of the government is accountable if voices are heard from agencies, groups or institutions outside the public sector representing citizens' interests from a particular constituency or field. Moreover, the government is obliged to empower members of agencies with political rights to run for elections and be elected; or, appoint them into the public sector as a way to make the government representative and to ensure that voices from all constituencies are included in policy-making.

===Public/private overlap===
With the increase over the last several decades in public service provided by private entities, especially in Britain and the United States, some have called for increased political accountability mechanisms for otherwise non-political entities.    Legal scholar Anne Davies, for instance, argues that the line between public institutions and private entities like corporations is becoming blurred in certain areas of public service in the United Kingdom, and that this can compromise political accountability in those areas.  She and others argue that some administrative law reform is necessary to address this accountability gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.competition-law.ox.ac.uk/members/profile.phtml?lecturer_code=daviesa |title=oxford law - the faculty and its members : anne davies |publisher=Competition-law.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to the public/private overlap in the United States, public concern over the contracting of government services (including military) and the resulting accountability gap has been highlighted recently following the shooting incident involving the Blackwater security firm in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/ed_harriman/2007/09/blackwater_poisons_the_well.html |title=Blackwater poisons the well |publisher=Commentisfree.guardian.co.uk |date=2007-09-28 |accessdate=2009-08-26 | location=London | first=Ed | last=Harriman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary studies==
Accountability involves either the expectation or assumption of account-giving behavior. The study of account giving as a sociological act was articulated in a 1968 article on "Accounts" by Marvin Scott and Stanford Lyman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Marvin B.|author2=Lyman, Stanford M.|date=February 1968|title=Accounts|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=33|issue=1|pages=46–62|doi=10.2307/2092239|pmid=5644339|publisher=American Sociological Review, Vol. 33, No. 1|jstor=2092239}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it can be traced as well to [[J. L. Austin]]'s 1956 essay "A Plea for Excuses",&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J.L. 1956-7. A plea for excuses. Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society.
Reprinted in [[J. O. Urmson]] &amp; [[G. J. Warnock]], eds., 1979, J. L. Austin: Philosophical Papers, 3rd edition. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 175-204.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he used excuse-making as an example of [[speech act]]s.

Communications scholars have extended this work through the examination of strategic uses of excuses, justifications, rationalizations, apologies and other forms of account giving behavior by individuals and corporations, and [[Philip Tetlock]] and his colleagues have applied experimental design techniques to explore how individuals behave under various scenarios and situations that demand accountability.

Recently, accountability has become an important topic in the discussion about the legitimacy of international institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=Ruth W.|author2=Keohane, Robert O.|year=2005|title=Accountability and Abuses of Power in World Politics|url=|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=99|issue=1|pages=29–43|doi=10.1017/S0003055405051476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because there is no global democratically elected body to which organizations must account, global organizations from all sectors  bodies are often criticized as having large accountability gaps. The Charter 99 for Global Democracy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oneworldtrust.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=14&amp;Itemid=55 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516034551/http://www.oneworldtrust.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=14&amp;Itemid=55 |archivedate=16 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; spearheaded by the [[One World Trust]], first proposed that cross-sector principles of accountability be researched and observed by institutions that affect people, independent of their legal status. One paradigmatic problem arising in the global context is that of institutions such as the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] who are founded and supported by wealthy nations or individuals and provide grants and loans, to developing nations. Should those institutions be accountable to their founders and investors or to the persons and nations they lend money to? In the debate over [[global justice]] and its distributional consequences, Cosmopolitans tend to advocate greater accountability to the disregarded interests of traditionally marginalized populations and developing nations. On the other hand, those in the [[Nationalism]] and Society of States traditions deny the tenets of [[moral universalism]] and argue that beneficiaries of global development initiatives have no substantive entitlement to call international institutions to account. The [[One World Trust]] Global Accountability Report, published in a first full cycle 2006 to 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oneworldtrust.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=73&amp;Itemid=60|title=Global Accountability Report (GAR)|author=Administrator|work=oneworldtrust.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124021950/http://www.oneworldtrust.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=73&amp;Itemid=60|archivedate=24 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one attempt to measure the capability of global organizations to be accountable to their stakeholders.

===Accountability in education===
Student accountability is traditionally based on hang school and classroom rules, combined with sanctions for infringement. As defined by National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME), accountability is "A program, often legislated, that attributes the responsibility for student learning to teachers, school administrators, and/or students. Test results typically are used to judge accountability, and often consequences are imposed for shortcomings."&lt;ref&gt;National Council on Measurement in Education http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorA {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722194028/http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorA |date=22 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, some educational establishments such as [[Sudbury Valley School|Sudbury schools]] believe that students are personally responsible for their acts, and that traditional schools do not permit students to choose their course of action fully; they do not permit students to embark on the course, once chosen; and they do not permit students to suffer the consequences of the course, once taken. Freedom of choice, freedom of action, freedom to bear the results of action are considered the three great freedoms that constitute personal responsibility. Sudbury schools claim that {{"'}}[[Value (ethics)|Ethics]]' is a course taught by life experience". They adduce that the essential ingredient for acquiring values—and for moral action is personal responsibility, that schools will become involved in the teaching of morals when they become communities of people who fully respect each other's right to make choices, and that the only way the schools can become meaningful purveyors of ethical values is if they provide students and adults with real-life experiences that are bearers of moral import. Students are given complete responsibility for their own education and the school is run by a [[direct democracy]] in which students and staff are equals.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D.

Pdf.] __This study examined moral discourse, reflection, and development in a school community with a process similar to that described by [[Lawrence Kohlberg]]. Data were drawn from an extensive set of field notes made in an ethnographic study at Sudbury Valley School (an ungraded, democratically structured school in Framingham, MA), where students, ranging in age from 4 to 19, are free to choose their own activities and companions. Vignettes were analyzed using grounded theory approach to qualitative analysis, and themes were developed from an analysis of observations of meetings. Each theme describes a participation level that students assume in the process and that provide opportunities for them to develop and deepen understanding of the balance of personal rights and responsibilities within a community. The study adds to the understanding of education and child development by describing a school that differs significantly in its practice from the wider educational community and by validating Kohlberg's thesis about developing moral reasoning.

==Standards==
Accountability standards have been set up, and organizations can voluntarily commit to them. Standards apply in particular to the non-profit world and to [[Corporate Social Responsibility]] (CSR) initiatives. Accountability standards include:
* [[INGO Accountability Charter]], signed by a large number of [[NGOs]] to "demonstrate their commitment to accountability and transparency"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/about-the-charter/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517195312/http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/about-the-charter/ |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[AccountAbility's AA1000 series]]. "principles-based standards to help organisations become more accountable, responsible and sustainable. They address issues affecting governance, business models and organizational strategy, as well as providing operational guidance on sustainability assurance and stakeholder engagement"&lt;ref&gt;Website: {{cite web |url=http://www.accountability.org/standards/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908225546/http://www.accountability.org/standards/index.html |archivedate=8 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some non-profit organizations set up their own commitments to accountability:
* Accountability, Learning and Planning System (ALPS) by [[ActionAid]],  a framework that sets out the key accountability requirements, guidelines, and processes.&lt;ref&gt;ActionAid (2005). [[ALPS - Accountability, Learning, and Planning System]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed symbolism==
[[Viktor Frankl]], neurologist, psychiatrist, author, and founder of [[logotherapy]] and one of the key figures in [[existential therapy]], in his book ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'' recommended "that the [[Statue of Liberty]] on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] (that has become a symbol of [[Liberty]] and [[Political freedom|Freedom]]) should be supplemented by a [[Statue of Responsibility]] on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast."]] Frankl stated: "Freedom, however, is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness. In fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness."&lt;ref&gt;[[Viktor Frankl|Frankl, Viktor Emil]] (1956) ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'', p. 209-210.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warnock, C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3489">'''Anthrobotics''' is the science of developing and studying [[robot]]s that are either entirely or in some way human-like.

The term ''anthrobotics'' was originally coined by Mark Rosheim in a paper entitled "Design of An Omnidirectional Arm" presented at the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] International Conference on Robotics and Automation, May 13–18, 1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;2162–2167. Rosheim says he derived the term from "...[[Anthropomorphic]] and [[Robotics]] to distinguish the new generation of dexterous robots from its simple industrial robot forebears." The word gained wider recognition as a result of its use in the title of Rosheim's subsequent book ''Robot Evolution: The Development of Anthrobotics'', which focussed on facsimiles of human physical and psychological skills and attributes.

However, a wider definition of the term ''anthrobotics'' has been proposed, in which the meaning is derived from ''[[anthropology]]'' rather than ''anthropomorphic''. This usage includes robots that respond to input in a human-like fashion, rather than simply mimicking human actions, thus theoretically being able to respond more flexibly or to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. This expanded definition also encompasses robots that are situated in social environments with the ability to respond to those environments appropriately, such as [[insect]] robots, robotic [[pet]]s, and the like.

Anthrobotics is now taught at some [[university|universities]], encouraging students not only to design and build robots for environments beyond current industrial applications, but also to speculate on the future of robotics that are embedded in the world at large, as [[mobile phone]]s and [[computer]]s are today. In 2016 philosopher [[Luis de Miranda]] created the Anthrobotics Cluster at the [[University of Edinburgh]] "a platform of cross-disciplinary research that seeks to investigate some of the biggest questions that will need to be answered"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futurism.com/anthrobotics-where-the-human-ends-and-the-robot-begins/ |title=Anthrobotics: Where The Human Ends and the Robot Begins |publisher=Futurism |date= |accessdate=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the relationship between humans, robots and intelligent systems and "a think tank on the social spread of robotics, and also how automation is part of the definition of what humans have always been".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robohub.org/unity-between-human-and-social-machines-what-if-we-humans-were-anthrobots/ |title=Unity Between Human &amp; Social Machines: What If We Humans Were Anthrobots? |publisher=Robohub |date= |accessdate=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explore the symbiotic relationship between humans and automated protocols.

'''''Antique Woodworking Tools: Their Craftsmanship from Earliest Times to the Twentieth Century''''' is [[David R. Russell|David Russell]]'s account of the history of woodworking tools illustrated profusely with items from his extensive collection of British, continental European and North American hand tools. 
Planes are given special attention and British makers, among them [[Holtzapffel]], [[T. Norris &amp; Son|Norris]], [[Alexander Mathieson &amp; Sons|Mathieson]] and [[Stewart Spiers|Spiers]], are discussed in depth.

==Summary==
A wide array of edge and boring tools provides a broad survey of hand tool-making from prehistory to today. Writing in ''[[The Times]]'', Huon Mallalieu encapsulated the function of the book: "Over the past 35 years [David Russell] has amassed probably the world’s largest collection of antique woodworking tools from the Stone Age to the 20th century ... The catalogue not only lists and lavishly illustrates 1556 items, but also makers’ stamps and associated material ..."&lt;ref&gt;Huon Mallalieu, "The heft of a hammer, the balance of an axe or the certainty of a saw are the links between man and material", ''The Times'', November 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
After looking at a range of tools from prehistory to the Romans, the book examines in detail more recent hand tools by function: from saws to drills and braces; from rules and gauges to bevels, squares and levels. Much of the book, however, is devoted to an extensive selection of wooden and metal planes and highlights their manifold functions. These planes are arranged within chapters on continental European, British and American models, with some of the great British makers from the eighteenth to the early twentieth century discussed in depth. A short chapter focuses on spurious and altered items, drawing the reader's attention to some of the pitfalls of collecting vintage tools.

==Critical reception==
The book has been widely acclaimed in both the general and specialized press. According to the ''[[Sheffield Telegraph]]'', "the book not only celebrates the collection but is considered the most serious work of reference of its kind to date and destined to become a 'bible' in its field".&lt;ref&gt;''Sheffield Telegraph'', December 9, 2010. [http://www.sheffieldtelegraph.co.uk/whats-on/arts/days-when-sheffielders-produced-tools-for-every-job-1-2842972 See full article].&lt;/ref&gt;
Looking at the book from another angle, Eve Kahn in the ''[[New York Times]]'' stated that the book was "intended to glamorize unsung innovations".&lt;ref&gt;Eve M. Kahn, "A Craftsman's Wares", ''New York Times'', September 13, 2013, p. C26. [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/arts/design/works-from-earliest-photographers-are-on-display-and-on-sale.html?_r=0 See full article].&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Duguay, writing in ''Canadian Woodworking &amp; Home Improvement'', declared that the book was "Lavish, stunning, outstanding, magnificent ... superlatives just don't do justice to [it]."&lt;ref&gt;Carl Duguay, "A 'must-have' for anyone who loves woodworking tools", ''Canadian Woodworking &amp; Home Improvement''  [https://www.canadianwoodworking.com/antique-woodworking-tools See full article].&lt;/ref&gt;

Journals of some of the leading tool societies have been generous in their praise. "David Russell’s book is a vehicle for sharing his fabulous collection with the world," enthused John Wells in the ''Chronicle'', the journal of the [[Early American Industries Association]]. "His unerring eye has sought out the most interesting tools available over the past 40 years, resulting in one of the world’s greatest collections of antique woodworking tools."&lt;ref&gt;John Wells, "A Bounty of Tools in an Outstanding Collector's Book", ''Chronicle'', vol. 64, no. 3, September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;   The late Frank Ham, writing in the Australian journal ''Tool Chest'', declared the book to be "the most impressive record of tools" he had ever seen.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Ham, ''Tool Chest'' (Journal of the Hand Tool Preservation Association of Australia), no. 108, May, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Focusing on the illustrations, Mark Bridge commented in ''[[Antiques Trade Gazette]]'' on how [[James Austin (photographer)|James Austin]], the book's photographer, had "managed to capture the elusive qualities of balance, texture and patina which make the finest tools a pleasure to handle, frequently lifting them into the realm of folk art".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bridge, "The young apprentice cabinetmaker who became a connoisseur", ''Antiques Trade Gazette'', October 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Behavior tree (artificial intelligence, robotics and control) }}

A '''Behavior Tree''' ('''BT''') is a [[mathematical model]] of [[Automated planning and scheduling|plan]] execution used in [[computer science]], [[robotics]], [[control systems]] and [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|video games]]. They describe switchings between a finite set of tasks in a modular fashion. Their strength comes from their ability to create very complex tasks composed of simple tasks, without worrying how the simple tasks are implemented. BTs present some similarities to [[State machine|hierarchical state machines]] with the key difference that the main building block of a behavior is a task rather than a state. Its ease of human understanding make BTs less error prone and very popular in the game developer community. BTs have been shown to generalize several other control architectures.&lt;ref name = "Colledanchise TRO16"&gt;Colledanchise Michele, and Ögren Petter 2016.

== Background ==

BTs originate from the computer game industry as a powerful tool to [[Behavior model|model the behavior]] of [[non-player character]]s (NPCs).&lt;ref name = "Damian Isla"&gt;Isla D. 2005.

They have been extensively used in high-profile video games such as [[Halo (series)|Halo]], [[BioShock (series)|Bioshock]], and [[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]. Recent works propose BTs as a multi-mission control framework for [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]], complex robots, robotic manipulation, and multi-robot systems.&lt;ref name = "ogren2"&gt;Ögren, Petter.

&lt;ref name = "Rabin"&gt;S. Rabin ["Game AI Pro" CRC Press 2014 ]&lt;/ref&gt;
as well as generic game environments such as PyGame and Unreal Engine (see links below).

== Relation to other Control Architectures ==
It has been shown that BTs generalize a number of earlier control architectures, such as
* The [[subsumption architecture|Subsumption Architecture]] by Brooks &lt;ref name = "colledanchise2"/&gt; 
* The Teleo-Reactive Programs by  [[Nils John Nilsson]] &lt;ref name = "colledanchise3"&gt;Colledanchise, Michele and Ögren Petter. "How Behavior Trees Generalize

* Sequential Behavior Decompositions &lt;ref name = "colledanchise2"/&gt;
* [[Decision Tree]]

== Key concepts ==

BT is graphically represented as a directed  [[Tree (set theory)|tree]] in which the nodes are classified as root, control flow nodes, or execution nodes (tasks). For each pair of connected nodes the outgoing node is called parent and the incoming node is called child. The root has no parents and exactly one child, the control flow nodes have one parent and at least one child, and the execution nodes have one parent and no children. Graphically, the children of a control flow node are placed below it, ordered from left to right.&lt;ref name = "craft ai"&gt;craft ai 2015. [http://www.craft.ai/blog/bt-101-behavior-trees-grammar-basics/  BT 101 – Behavior Trees grammar basics]&lt;/ref&gt;

The execution of a BT starts from the root which sends ticks with a certain frequency to its child. A tick is an enabling signal that allows the execution of a child. When the execution of a node in the BT is allowed, it returns to the parent a status '''running''' if its execution has not finished yet, '''success''' if it has achieved its goal, or '''failure''' otherwise.

=== Control flow node ===

A control flow node is used to control the subtasks of which it is composed. A control flow node may be either a selector (fallback) node or a sequence node. They run each of their subtasks in turn. When a subtask is completed and returns its status (success or failure), the control flow node decides whether to execute the next subtask or not.

==== Selector (fallback) node ====

[[File:Fallback in Behavior tree.png|thumb|right|Figure I. Graphical representation of a fallback composition of N tasks.]]

Fallback nodes are used to find and execute the first child that does not fail. A fallback node will return immediately with a status code of success or running when one of its children returns success or running (see Figure I and the pseudocode below). The children are ticked in order of importance, from left to right.

In pseudocode, the algorithm for a fallback composition is:

 1 '''for''' i from 1 to n '''do'''
 2     childstatus ← Tick(child(i))
 3     '''if''' childstatus = running
 4        '''return''' running
 5     '''else if''' childstatus = success
 6        '''return''' success
 7 '''end'''
 8 '''return''' failure

==== Sequence node ====

[[File:Sequence composition in behaviour trees.png|thumb|right|Figure II. Graphical representation of a sequence composition of N tasks.]]
Sequence nodes are used to find and execute the first child that has not yet succeeded. A sequence node will return immediately with a status code of failure or running when one of its children returns failure or running (see Figure II and the pseudocode below). The children are ticked in order, from left to right.

In pseudocode, the algorithm for a sequence composition is:

 1 '''for''' i from 1 to n '''do'''
 2     childstatus ← Tick(child(i))
 3     '''if''' childstatus = running
 4        '''return''' running
 5     '''else if''' childstatus = failure
 6        '''return''' failure
 7 '''end'''
 8 '''return''' success

== Mathematical state space definition ==

In order to apply control theory tools to the analysis of Behavior Trees,
BT can be  defined as three-tuple.&lt;ref name="colledanchise2"&gt;Colledanchise Michele, and Ögren Petter.[http://www.csc.kth.se/~miccol/Michele_Colledanchise/Publications_files/IROS14_CO.pdf "How Behavior Trees Modularize Robustness and Safety in Hybrid Systems." In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2014 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on, IEEE, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
 T_i=\{f_i,r_i, \Delta t\}, 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; i\in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the index of the tree, &lt;math&gt;f_i: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow  \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is a vector field representing the right hand side of an ordinary difference equation, &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is a time step and 
&lt;math&gt;r_i: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow  \{R_i,S_i,F_i\}&lt;/math&gt; is the return status, that can be equal to either 
Running &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;,
Success &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt;, or
Failure &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Note''': A task is degenerate BT with no parent and no child.

=== Behavior tree execution ===

The execution of a BT is described by the following standard ordinary difference equations:

&lt;math&gt;x_{k+t}(t_{k+1})=f_i( x_{k}(t_{k}))  &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t_{k+1}=t_{k}+\Delta t &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; k\in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; represent the discrete time, and  &lt;math&gt; x \in \mathbb{R}^n  &lt;/math&gt; is the state space of the system modelled by the behavior tree.

=== Fallback composition ===

Two BTs &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_j&lt;/math&gt; can be composed into a more complex BT &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; using a Fallback operator.

&lt;math&gt;T_0=\mbox{fallback}(T_i,T_j).&lt;/math&gt;

Then return status &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; and the vector field &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt; associated with &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; are defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
r_0(x_k) = 
\begin{cases}
r_j(x_k) &amp; \text{ if } x_k \in \mathcal{F}_1\\
r_i(x_k) &amp; \text{ otherwise }.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
f_0(x_k) = 
\begin{cases}
f_j(x_k) &amp; \text{ if } x_k \in \mathcal{F}_1\\
f_i(x_k) &amp; \text{ otherwise }.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Sequence composition ===

Two BTs &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_j&lt;/math&gt; can be composed into a more complex BT &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; using a Sequence operator.

&lt;math&gt;T_0=\mbox{sequence}(T_i,T_j).&lt;/math&gt;

Then return status &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; and the vector field &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt; associated with &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; are defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
r_0(x_k) = 
\begin{cases}
r_j(x_k) &amp; \text{ if } x_k \in \mathcal{S}_1\\
r_i(x_k) &amp; \text{ otherwise }.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
f_0(x_k) = 
\begin{cases}
f_j(x_k) &amp; \text{ if } x_k \in \mathcal{S}_1\\
f_i(x_k) &amp; \text{ otherwise }.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The '''bioconversion of biomass to mixed alcohol fuels''' can be accomplished using the MixAlco process. Through bioconversion of [[biomass]] to a mixed [[alcohol fuel]], more energy from the biomass will end up as liquid fuels than in converting biomass to [[ethanol]] by [[yeast]] fermentation.

The process involves a biological/chemical method for converting any [[biodegradation|biodegradable]] material (e.g., urban wastes, such as [[municipal solid waste]], [[biodegradable waste]], and [[sewage treatment|sewage sludge]], agricultural residues such as [[corn stover]], sugarcane [[bagasse]], [[cotton gin]] trash, [[manure]]) into useful chemicals, such as [[carboxylic acids]] (e.g., [[Acetic acid|acetic]], [[Propionic acid|propionic]], [[butyric acid]]), [[ketones]] (e.g., acetone, [[methyl ethyl ketone]], [[diethyl ketone]]) and [[biofuels]], such as a mixture of primary alcohols (e.g., ethanol, [[Propan-1-ol|propanol]], [[n-Butanol|''n''-butanol]]) and/or a mixture of secondary alcohols (e.g., [[isopropanol]], [[2-butanol]], 3-pentanol). Because of the many products that can be economically produced, this process is a true [[biorefinery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://soilcrop.tamu.edu/podcasts/seminars/MarkHoltzapple/9-5-07-640.wmv Advanced Biomass Refinery – Third-Generation 2007 (video)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701101942/http://soilcrop.tamu.edu//podcasts/seminars/MarkHoltzapple/9-5-07-640.wmv |date=1 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/Region6/6pd/pd-u-sw/wte_ftworth/cafo/holtzapple.pdf EPA Presentation on the process]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aiche.confex.com/aiche/2005/techprogram/P14000.HTM Application]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:MixAlco Pilot Plant.JPG|right|thumbnail|500px|Pilot Plant ([[College Station, Texas|College Station]], [[Texas]])]]
The process uses a mixed culture of naturally occurring microorganisms found in natural habitats such as the [[rumen]] of cattle, [[termite]] guts, and marine and terrestrial swamps to [[anaerobic digestion|anaerobically digest]] biomass into a mixture of carboxylic acids produced during the [[acidogenesis|acidogenic]] and [[acetogenesis|acetogenic]] stages of [[anaerobic digestion]], however with the inhibition of the [[methanogenesis|methanogenic]] final stage. The more popular methods for production of ethanol and [[cellulosic ethanol]] use enzymes that must be isolated first to be added to the biomass and thus convert the starch or cellulose into simple sugars, followed then by yeast fermentation into ethanol. This process does not need the addition of such enzymes as these microorganisms make their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As the microoganisms anaerobically digest the biomass and convert it into a mixture of carboxylic acids, the [[pH]] must be controlled. This is done by the addition of a [[buffering agent]] (e.g., [[ammonium bicarbonate]], [[calcium carbonate]]), thus yielding a mixture of [[carboxylate]] salts. [[Methanogenesis]], being the natural final stage of anaerobic digestion, is inhibited by the presence of the [[ammonium]] ions or by the addition of an inhibitor (e.g., [[iodoform]]).  The resulting fermentation broth contains the produced carboxylate salts that must be dewatered. This is achieved efficiently by [[vapor-compression evaporation]]. Further chemical refining of the dewatered fermentation broth may then take place depending on the final chemical or biofuel product desired.

The condensed distilled water from the vapor-compression evaporation system is recycled back to the fermentation. On the other hand, if raw sewage or other waste water with high [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]] in need of treatment is used as the water for the fermentation, the condensed distilled water from the evaporation can be recycled back to the city or to the original source of the high-BOD waste water. Thus, this process can also serve as a [[water treatment]] facility, while producing valuable chemicals or biofuels.

Because the system uses a mixed culture of microorganisms, besides not needing any enzyme addition, the fermentation requires no sterility or aseptic conditions, making this front step in the process more economical than in more popular methods for the production of cellulosic ethanol. These savings in the front end of the process, where volumes are large, allows flexibility for further chemical transformations after dewatering, where volumes are small.

==Carboxylic acids==
{{Details|Carboxylic acid}}
[[Carboxylic acids]] can be regenerated from the carboxylate salts using a process known as "acid springing". This process makes use of a high-molecular-weight [[tertiary amine]] (e.g., trioctylamine), which is switched with the [[cation]] (e.g., ammonium or calcium). The resulting amine carboxylate can then be thermally decomposed into the amine itself, which is recycled, and the corresponding [[carboxylic acid]]. In this way, theoretically, no chemicals are consumed or wastes produced during this step.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, S.A. 2000. Conversion of carboxylate salts to carboxylic acids via reactive distillation. M.S. Thesis&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ketones==
{{Details|Ketone}}
There are two methods for making ketones. The first one consists on thermally converting calcium carboxylate salts into the corresponding ketones. This was a common method for making acetone from [[calcium acetate]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Yeh, H. 2002. Pyrolytic decomposition of carboxylate salts. M.S. thesis&lt;/ref&gt; The other method for making ketones consists on converting the vaporized carboxylic acids on a [[catalyst|catalytic bed]] of [[zirconium oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, D. 2002. Ketonization of acetic acid. B.S. student report.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alcohols==
{{Details|Alcohol}}

===Primary alcohols===

The undigested residue from the fermentation may be used in [[gasification]] to make [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). This H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can then be used to [[hydrogenolysis|hydrogenolyze]] the [[esters]] over a catalyst (e.g., copper chromite),&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, M.W., Harris, N., Turner, K. 1982. Process for Hydrogenolysis of Carboxylic Acid Esters WO 82/03854, Nov. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; which are produced by esterifying either the ammonium carboxylate salts (e.g., [[ammonium acetate]], propionate, butyrate) or the carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, propionic, butyric acid) with a high-molecular-weight alcohol (e.g., [[hexanol]], [[heptanol (disambiguation)|heptanol]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/jacsat/1951/73/i11/f-pdf/f_ja01155a075.pdf?sessid=6006l3 Preparation of esters by reaction of ammonium salts with alcohols.]&lt;/ref&gt; From the hydrogenolysis, the final products are the high-molecular-weight alcohol, which is recycled back to the [[esterification]], and the corresponding primary alcohols (e.g., ethanol, propanol, butanol).

===Secondary alcohols===

The secondary alcohols (e.g., isopropanol, 2-butanol, 3-pentanol) are obtained by [[hydrogenation|hydrogenating]] over a catalyst (e.g., Raney nickel) the corresponding ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone).&lt;ref&gt;Aldrett-Lee, S. 2000. Catalytic hydrogenation of liquid ketones with emphasis on gas–liquid mass transfer. PhD dissertation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drop-in biofuels==
The primary or secondary alcohols obtained as described above may undergo conversion to drop-in [[biofuels]], fuels which are compatible with current fossil fuel infrastructure such as [[biogasoline]], [[green diesel]] and bio-jet fuel.  Such is done by subjecting the alcohols to dehydration followed by oligomerization using zeolite catalysts in a manner similar to the [[methanex]] process, which used to produce gasoline from [[methanol]] in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nzic.org.nz/ChemProcesses/energy/7D.pdf |title=Production of gasoline from methanol. |access-date=27 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201041305/http://nzic.org.nz/ChemProcesses/energy/7D.pdf |archive-date=1 December 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acetic acid versus ethanol==

Cellulosic-ethanol manufacturing plants are bound to be net exporters of electricity because a large portion of the [[lignocellulosic biomass]], namely [[lignin]], remains undigested and it must be burned, thus producing electricity for the plant and excess electricity for the grid.  As the market grows and this technology becomes more widespread, coupling the liquid fuel and the [[electricity market]]s will become more and more difficult.{{fact|date=October 2014}}

Acetic acid, unlike ethanol, is biologically produced from simple sugars without the production of [[carbon dioxide]]:

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin: 1em 10%; border: 1px solid"&gt;
C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; → &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;center&gt;(Biological production of ethanol)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin: 1em 10%; border: 1px solid"&gt;
C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; → &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH &lt;center&gt;(Biological production of [[acetic acid]])&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Because of this, on a mass basis, the yields will be higher than in ethanol fermentation. If then, the undigested residue (mostly lignin) is used to produce hydrogen by gasification, it is ensured that more energy from the biomass will end up as liquid fuels rather than excess heat/electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/841137-u4bFGI/841137.PDF Eggeman, T., Verser, D., and Weber, E. (2005), An Indirect Route for Ethanol Production US Department of Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin: 1em 10%; border: 1px solid"&gt;
  3 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; → &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;center&gt;(Hydrogenation of acetic acid)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin: 1em 10%; border: 1px solid"&gt;
C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (from [[cellulose]]) &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (from lignin)  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; → &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;center&gt;(Overall reaction)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

A more comprehensive description of the economics of each of the fuels is given on the pages [[alcohol fuel]] and [[ethanol fuel]], more information about the economics of various systems can be found on the central page [[biofuel]].

==Stage of development==
The system has been in development since 1991, moving from the laboratory scale (10 g/day) to the pilot scale (200&amp;nbsp;lb/day) in 2001. A small demonstration-scale plant (5 ton/day) has been constructed and is under operation and a 220 ton/day demonstration plant is expected in 2012.

==Book rentals==
Historically before the [[industrial revolution]], books were too expensive for commoners to buy, and there were businesses which made profit by renting out books for a fee. ''[[Kashi-hon]]'' in [[Japan]] was one of such businesses. In modern era in developing and developed nations, for-profit book rental services have started to lend physical [[books]], [[audiobook]] CDs, e-books, and audiobook MP3s through stores and/or by an online (website) interface after popularization of the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)|url = http://www.w3.org/|website = www.w3.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most book rental companies provide books with doorstep delivery using logistic services. Following the popular [[Netflix]] model for video rental, many book companies have applied features such as unlimited rentals, free shipping, and no late fees to their book distribution services.

== Book rental models ==

=== Based on rental method ===
Based on the rental method the book rental companies can be categorized into two subgroups:
# Book rental companies having a subscription-based models where a monthly or periodic subscription fee is charged and members can rent a number of books based on the subscription. 
# Book rental companies taking a fraction of book cost as rent. This is the most prevalent model in textbook and college book renting.

=== Based on type of book rented ===
Based on the type of books that the book rental service rents following classification can be done:
# Physical or Printed Books. The category can further be subdivided into 
## Companies primarily renting novels, fiction and story books. 
# E-book renters. Many companies renting physical books also rent e-books. Since e-book rental distribution rights are totally different from physical books most of the smaller companies are not able to rent e-books for standard publishers like [[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw-Hill]], [[Pearson Education|Pearson]], [[Prentice Hall]], [[Cengage Learning|Cengage]] etc due to high license fees that needs to be paid for rental rights.

[[File:Logo for CARTA (Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny).png|thumb|right|CARTA logo]]

The '''Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny''' (CARTA) is an Organized Research Unit (ORU) at the [[University of California, San Diego]].  Formally established in 2008, CARTA is a collaboration between faculty members of UCSD main campus, the [[UCSD School of Medicine]], the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies]], and interested scientists at other institutions from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306121005/http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20080410/news_1c10origins.html|title=Original kin|author=Scott LaFee|publisher=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=April 10, 2008|accessdate=2 December 2018 |via =Wayback Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916080641/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/18518|title=New center for study of human origins opens|author=Debra Kain|publisher=UC Newsroom|date=September 8, 2008|accessdate=2 December 2018 |via =Wayback Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306131327/http://www.lajollalight.com/news/2008/sep/17/human-origins-focus-of-center/|title=Human origins focus of center|author=Staff|publisher=La Jolla Light|date=September 17, 2008|accessdate=2 December 2018 |via= Wayback Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CARTA was formed in order to promote [[transdisciplinary]] research into [[anthropogeny]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080702/full/454021a.html|title=Human evolution: Details of being human|author=Bruce Lieberman|publisher=Nature|date=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the study of human origins - drawing on methods from a number of traditional disciplines spanning the humanities, social, biomedical, biological, computational &amp; engineering and physical &amp; chemical sciences.

==History of CARTA==

Before CARTA became an established and formal UCSD recognized Organized Research Unit, a [[multidisciplinary]] effort to study human origins had already been underway in the [[La Jolla]] area for over a decade, coordinated by the UCSD Project for Explaining the Origin of Humans (POH). The group involved local experts in San Diego as well as many others throughout the world. The primary activity of the group was to organize multi-disciplinary interactions amongst members (via meetings in [[La Jolla]]), and via secure internet-based mechanisms. These efforts have now been converted into a larger and more publicly active research program, which facilitate graduate and postgraduate education in relevant departments and programs.

==Mission statement==

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Use all rational and ethical approaches to seek all verifiable facts from all relevant disciplines to explore and explain the origins of the human phenomenon, while minimizing complex organizational structures and hierarchies, and avoiding unnecessary paperwork and bureaucracy.  In the process, raise awareness and understanding of the study of human origins within the academic community and the public at large."&lt;ref&gt;[http://carta.anthropogeny.org/about/policies/full-mission-statement/ CARTA website].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Organization and leadership==

The co-directors of the Institute are  [[Ajit Varki]], Professor of Medicine and Cellular &amp; Molecular  Medicine, UCSD,  [[Margaret Schoeninger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anthropology.ucsd.edu/Faculty_Profiles/schoeninger.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616084421/http://anthropology.ucsd.edu/Faculty_Profiles/schoeninger.html |archivedate=2010-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor and former Chair of the Department of  Anthropology, UCSD, and [[Fred Gage]], Professor, [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies]], and Adjunct Professor of Neurosciences,  UCSD

==Activities==

'''Chromosome 2q deletion''' is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing copy of the genetic material located on the long arm (q) of chromosome 2. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with chromosome 2q deletion include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and distinctive facial features. Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the deletion on to their children. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/3744/chromosome-2q-deletion|title=Chromosome 2q deletion - Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) – an NCATS Program|website=rarediseases.info.nih.gov|accessdate=12 August 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Unk.cilliate.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 2. Cilliate undergoing the last processes of binary fission, the cleavage furrow being clearly visible]]

In cell biology, the '''cleavage furrow''' is the indentation of the cell's surface that begins the progression of cleavage, by which animal and some algal cells undergo [[cytokinesis]], the final splitting of the membrane, in the process of [[cell division]]. The same proteins responsible for muscle contraction, [[actin]] and [[myosin]], begin the process of forming the cleavage furrow, creating an [[actomyosin ring]].  Other [[cytoskeletal]] proteins and actin binding proteins are involved in the procedure.

== Mechanism ==
Plant cells do not perform cytokinesis through this exact method but the two procedures are not totally different. Animal cells form an actin-myosin [[contractile ring]] within the equatorial region of the [[cell membrane]] that constricts to form the cleavage furrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cao LG, Wang YL |title=Mechanism of the formation of contractile ring in dividing cultured animal cells.

== Cell cycle ==
The [[cell cycle]] begins with [[interphase]] when the DNA replicates, the cell grows and prepares to enter mitosis. [[Mitosis]] includes four phases, [[prophase]], [[metaphase]], [[anaphase]], and [[telophase]]. Prophase is the initial phase when [[spindle fibers]] appear that function to move the [[chromosomes]] toward opposite poles. This spindle apparatus consists of microtubules, microfilaments and a complex network of various proteins. During metaphase, the chromosomes line up using the spindle apparatus in the middle of the cell along the equatorial plate.  The chromosomes move to opposite poles during anaphase and remain attached to the spindle fibers by their centromeres. Animal cell cleavage furrow formation is caused by a ring of actin microfilaments called the contractile ring, which forms during early anaphase. Myosin is present in the region of the contractile ring as concentrated microfilaments and actin filaments are predominant in this region.  The actin filaments here are both pre-existing and new. Cleavage is driven by these [[motor proteins]], actin and myosin, which are the same proteins involved with muscle contraction. During cellular cleavage, the contractile ring tightens around the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell until the cytoplasm is pinched into two daughter cells. During the final phase of mitosis, telophase, the furrow forms an intercellular bridge using [[mitotic spindle]] fibers. [[Phosphatidylethanolamine]] (PE) has been shown to be present during this time which indicates that is may play a role in movement between the plasma membrane and contractile ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Emoto K, Kobayashi T, Yamaji A |title=Redistribution of phosphatidylethanolamine at the cleavage furrow of dividing cells during cytokinesis |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=93 |issue=23 |pages=12867–72 |date=November 1996 |pmid=8917511 |pmc=24012 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8917511 |doi=10.1073/pnas.93.23.12867|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge is then broken and resealed to form two identical daughter cells during cytokinesis. The breakage is formed by microtubules and the resealing is negated by [[exocytosis|Calcium dependent exocytosis]] using Golgi vesicles.&lt;ref name=Skop01/&gt; In comparison, the plant cell septum and the animal cell mid-zone are analogous. Both require vesicular secretions by the Golgi apparatus for resealing and formation of the cytoskeletal network in addition to microtubules and microfilaments for division and movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Togo T, Alderton JM, Bi GQ, Steinhardt RA |title=The mechanism of facilitated cell membrane resealing |journal=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26147">The '''Clore Leadership Programme''' is the first initiative of its kind in the UK aimed at developing and strengthening leadership across the cultural and creative sectors. The Programme was initiated in 2003 by the [http://www.cloreduffield.org.uk/ Clore Duffield Foundation] and is sustained by a partnership between private philanthropy and public funding. The organisation invests in individuals, drawing on their creative potential to raising the game in the arts and creative sectors.

The Programme awards its flagship Clore Fellowships annually to exceptional individuals drawn from across the UK and beyond, and runs a choice of programmes tailored to the leadership needs of arts professionals at different stages of their career.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cloreleadership.org/page.aspx?p=31&lt;/ref&gt; The participants are drawn from a range of specialisms including the visual and performing arts, film and digital media, libraries, museums, archives and heritage, and cultural policy. In the last 10 years, over 250 fellowships have been awarded and nearly 1000 leaders have attended the Short Courses, enabling the participants to form a well-networked and connected arts leadership sector. Graduates of the scheme dot the salient points of the cultural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Arts Industry, 16 May 2008, By Simon Tait&lt;/ref&gt;

The Programme has inspired other initiatives in the UK and beyond, in particular the [http://www.cloresocialleadership.org.uk/ Clore Social Leadership Programme].

==Background==
Initiated by the [http://www.cloreduffield.org.uk/ Clore Duffield Foundation], and sustained by the Foundation's generous support, the Programme is the UK's first cross-disciplinary leadership programme for the cultural and creative sector. It was established as an independent organisation in 2004, after Dame [[Vivien Duffield]] had instigated research into the need for leadership training in the cultural programme.&lt;ref&gt;Arts Industry, 16 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; That research discovered that leadership development was often a question of accident rather than design, and that – without getting in the way of serendipity – it was time to put some of the design in place.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2011/dec/14/culture-leaders-clore-leadership&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the vision of its Founding Director [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]], the Programme focused initially on the Fellowship Programme, aimed at shaping creative leaders through in-depth learning, and tailored as far as possible to the needs, aspirations and circumstances of between 20 and 30 individuals a year. The structure of the Fellowship programme is based on recommendations which were made to the Clore Duffield Foundation by John Holden and [[Robert Hewison]], (see [http://www.cloreduffield.org.uk/cms/user_files/files/CLP%20Task%20Force%20Final%20Report%20Full.pdf their report]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, and the [http://www.cloreduffield.org.uk/cms/user_files/files/CLP%20Task%20Force%20Final%20Report%20Summary.pdf Executive Summary]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}). The course is unique outside the US, and includes workshops and residential courses, an extended placement, individually-selected training, mentoring and coaching, as well as opportunities for research and the development of skills.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6230572/Clore-Leadership-Programme-enhances-the-arts.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it was first established, the Clore Leadership Programme has been a pioneer in leadership development, a source of expert advice and an inspirational example for other initiatives in the UK and beyond, including the [http://www.cloresocialleadership.org.uk/ Clore Social Leadership Programme].

Developments in the Programme since 2004 have included:

•	Intensive fortnight-long residential Short Courses

•	A Board Development programme, to strengthen governance in the cultural sector

•	The extension of the Fellowships to a small number of international participants

•	One- and two-day follow-up courses (Clore Plus)

•	An association with the University of Hong Kong to create Asia’s first Advanced Cultural Leadership Programme 
 
•	One-week courses for Emerging Leaders

•	The creation of consortia of large-scale national cultural organisations, to support the Fellowship programme

•	The introduction of leadership development days, run in partnership with other organisations

==Founders==
The founding Director of the Clore Leadership Programme was [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]], who from 1997–2001 had been Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.  In July 2008 he stepped down and was succeeded as Director by Sue Hoyle. The current Chair is [[Sandy Nairne]], former Director of the National Portrait Gallery.

==Courses==
From freelancers, entrepreneurs to heads of established institutions, the Clore Leadership Programme nurtures dynamic and diverse leaders. Each year, the Programme awards fellowships and designs programmes tailored to the varied leadership needs of arts professionals at different stages of their career. These include awarding the Clore Fellowship (annually), and running four residential Short Courses (each runs for a fortnight), an Emerging Leaders’ Course (a week’s residential programme) and a number of Clore Plus days (follow-up courses for those who have been through the various programmes at Clore). The Programme also works in partnership with others to deliver leadership development days.

===The Clore Fellowship Programme===

The flagship [http://www.cloreleadership.org/fellowships.aspx Clore Fellowship] is offered to arts and creative industries’ practitioners drawn primarily from the UK. The Fellowship spans a year of intense activity, and includes residential courses, group workshops, projects, and a customised programme of personal and professional development. Each Fellow embarks on a programme of tuition, research, training and secondment, tailored to their specific cultural sector, interests and aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times, 19 Jan 2008, By Peter Aspden&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main features that distinguishes Clore from other leadership programmes is the cross-cultural element. People doing the programme are drawn from the arts and culture sector in its widest sense, and Fellows are seconded to other cultural organisations rather than other libraries or organizations similar to their own.&lt;ref&gt;Impact, Journal of Career Development Group | Summer 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clore Leadership Programme offers a number of [http://www.cloreleadership.org/page.aspx?p=53 International Fellowships] to exceptional individuals from prioritised countries outside the UK. These include Chevening Scholarships on the Clore Leadership Programme funded by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office in countries such as India, China, Jordan and Egypt, and the Hong Kong Scholarships on the Clore Leadership Programme funded by the [http://www.hab.gov.hk/ Home Affairs Bureau] of the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

The Clore Duffield Foundation supports the core costs of the Fellowship programme. Individual fellowships are supported by a range of public funders, philanthropic foundations, Consortia partners  and international partners, and are awarded to 25 and individual participants every year. The Programme also  occasionally accepts self-funded Fellowships.

===Short Course on Cultural Leadership===
[http://www.cloreleadership.org/short-courses.aspx Short Courses] offer numerous opportunities every year for ambitious and creative individuals to undergo a two-week intensive residential training course structured to deliver essential knowledge and skills required by cultural leaders today. The Short Course Programme is supported by [http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/ Arts Council England], through a three-year commissioned grant to develop resilient leadership.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cloreleadership.org/short-courses.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emerging Leaders’ Course===
The [http://www.cloreleadership.org/page.aspx?p=36 Emerging Leaders Programme] is a 5-day residential course aimed at people in the early stages of their career. This Programme is funded by [http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/ Arts Council England] through a commissioned grant to develop resilient leadership.

==Partners==
The work of the Clore Leadership Programme would not have been possible without the extensive support it receives from its funding partners drawn from the public, private and cultural sectors.

==Impact and Alumni==

The Clore Fellows and course participants have gone from strength to strength, steering new projects, establishing innovative arts organisations, enabling higher growth and assuming key leadership positions in the arts sectors all over the world. The results have been extraordinarily successful — Clore graduates are now in top jobs at the likes of the Royal Academy and the Arts Council.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6230572/Clore-Leadership-Programme-enhances-the-arts.html&lt;/ref&gt; Innumerable cultural leaders from the UK and abroad have walked through its doors and on to better jobs, including Gavin Reid, previously a trumpet player, who since undertaking the programme is now Director of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/observations-clore-leadership-programme-provides-a-step-up-for-future-royal-ballet-supremos-1764846.html&lt;/ref&gt; The programme is rooted in the belief that organisations which deliberately foster leadership and support their future leaders, do better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalartsmanager.com/2014/05/22/wheres-next-generation-music-leaders/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529214430/http://www.internationalartsmanager.com/2014/05/22/wheres-next-generation-music-leaders/ |archivedate=2014-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other luminaries include Axel Rüger, formerly Curator of Dutch Paintings for the National Gallery, who has made the leap to Director of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam while Moira Sinclair, previously Director of Vital Arts, an arts and health initiative, is now Executive Director, Arts Council London.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/observations-clore-leadership-programme-provides-a-step-up-for-future-royal-ballet-supremos-1764846.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is predicted that their expertise will  play a major role in helping the arts weather the stormy years ahead.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6230572/Clore-Leadership-Programme-enhances-the-arts.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clore Leadership Programme draws on the creative potential of leaders to raise the game in the arts and creative sectors. The idea behind initiating the Programme was to transform the cultural sector as a whole through the actions of emerging leaders and the work they do, both individually and collaboratively. As [[Nick Merriman]],  Director, Manchester Museum, University of Manchester, said:  “It (Clore Leadership Programme) has helped everyone take investment in leadership much more seriously and to think realistically about succession planning.” &lt;ref&gt;Museums Journal, June 2013, by John Holt&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside leadership development, the Programme has also had a positive impact on the sustainability of the entire sector  and is seen to have been a key player in “a silent revolution in the arts in Britain, where they are now incomparably better managed than they’ve ever been before.” &lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6230572/Clore-Leadership-Programme-enhances-the-arts.html&lt;/ref&gt;  “Thirty years ago, when faced with severe cuts, the sector almost collapsed. This is not the case now and that reflects the quality of the leadership we have. Clore has been a key part of that," said Mark Taylor, Director of the Museums Association.&lt;ref&gt;Museums Journal, June 2013, by John Holt&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clore Leadership Programme has not only succeeded in creating a cadre of creative and cultural leaders,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artsprofessional.co.uk/magazine/270/article/generous-leadership&lt;/ref&gt; but has stimulated investment in leadership on the part of governments, agencies, foundations and charities. The Programme has inspired other initiatives in the UK and beyond, including the Clore Social Leadership Programme for leaders from the social sector, Asia’s first [http://www.culture.hku.hk/ Advanced Cultural Leadership Programme] in Hong Kong, and a capacity-building course for arts managers in South Asia ([http://www.arthinksouthasia.org/ ARThink South Asia Fellowship]) created by a graduate of the Clore Programme.

[[File:Calliostoma tigris.JPG|thumb|''[[Calliostoma tigris]]'']]
[[File:Sea shell (Trinidad &amp; Tobago 2009).jpg|thumb|Shell of ''[[Lobatus gigas]]'', the queen conch]]
'''Conchology''' (from {{lang-grc|[[wikt:κόγχος|κόγχος]]}} ''konkhos'', "cockle") is the study of [[mollusc shell]]s. Conchology is one aspect of [[malacology]], the study of molluscs; however, malacology is the study of molluscs as whole organisms, whereas conchology is confined to the study of their shells. It includes the study of land and freshwater mollusc shells as well as [[seashell]]s and extends to the study of a [[gastropod]]'s [[operculum (gastropod)|operculum]].

Conchology is now sometimes seen as an archaic study, because relying on only one aspect of an organism's [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] can be misleading. However, a shell often gives at least some insight into molluscan [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and historically the shell was often the only part of exotic species that was available for study. Even in current museum collections it is common for the dry material (shells) to greatly exceed the amount of material that is preserved whole in alcohol.

Conchologists mainly deal with four molluscan orders: the [[gastropod]]s (snails), [[bivalve]]s (clams), [[Polyplacophora]] (chitons) and [[Scaphopoda]] (tusk shells). [[Cephalopod]]s only have small internal shells, with the exception of the [[Nautiloidea]]. Some groups, such as the sea slug [[nudibranch]]s, have lost their shells altogether, while in others it has been replaced by a [[protein]] support structure.

== Shell collecting versus conchology ==
[[File:Seashell vendor.jpeg|thumb|A vendor in [[Tanzania]] with a variety of large [[seashell]]s for sale]]

The terms ''shell collector'' and ''conchologist'' can be regarded as two distinct categories. Not all shell collectors are conchologists; some are primarily concerned with the [[aesthetic]] value of shells instead of their scientific study. It is also true that not all conchologists are shell collectors; this type of research only requires access to private or institutional shell collections. There is some debate in the conchological community, with some people regarding all shell collectors (regardless of motivation) as conchologists.

== History ==
Molluscs have probably been used by [[primate]]s as a food source long before [[human]]s evolved. Shell collecting, the precursor of conchology, probably goes back as far as there have been humans living near beaches.

[[Stone Age]] seashell necklaces have been found, sometimes in areas far from the ocean, indicating that they were traded. Shell [[jewellery]] is found at almost all archaeological sites, including at ancient [[Aztec]] ruins, digs in ancient [[China]], and the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]].

During the [[Renaissance]] people began taking interest in natural objects of beauty to put in [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]]. Because of their attractiveness, variety, durability and ubiquity, shells became a large part of these collections. Towards the end of the 17th century, people began looking at shells with scientific interest. [[Martin Lister]] in 1685–1692 published ''[[Historia Conchyliorum]]'', which was the first comprehensive conchological text, having over 1000 [[Intaglio (printmaking)|engraved plates]].

[[File:Lister Martin conchs 1770.png|thumb|200px|right|A plate from Lister’s book, showing what he calls ''[[buccinis]] shells'']]

[[George Rumpf]], or Rumphius, (1627–1702) published the first mollusc taxonomy. He suggested "single shelled ones" ([[Polyplacophora]], [[limpet]]s, and [[abalone]]), "snails or whelks" ([[Gastropoda]]), and "two-shelled ones" ([[Bivalvia]]). Many of Rumpf's terms were adopted by [[Carl Linnaeus]]. Rumpf continued to do important scientific work after he went blind, working by touch.

The study of [[zoology]], including conchology, was revolutionized by [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[naturalist]] Carl Linnaeus and his system of [[binomial nomenclature]]. 683 of the 4000 or so animal species he described are now considered to be molluscs, although Linnaeus placed them in several phyla at the time.&lt;ref name="Ref_"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxshells.org/|title=Jacksonville Shells – WWW.JAXSHELLS.ORG|work=jaxshells.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English word "conchology" was coined in the 1770s by the British Sephardi naturalist [[Emanuel Mendez da Costa]], who published [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/46649#page/7/mode/1up/ ''The Elements of Conchology: or, an Introduction to the Knowledge of Shells''] in London in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/38225/|title=''Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v. conchology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many prominent conchologists in the past two centuries. The [[Sowerby family]] were famous collectors, dealers, and illustrators. [[John Mawe]] (1764–1829) produced arguably the first conchology guidebook, ''[[The Voyager's Companion or Shell-Collector's Pilot]]'' as well as ''[[The Linnæan System of Conchology]]''. [[Hugh Cuming]] (1791–1865) is famous for his huge collection and numerous discoveries of new species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=British Pioneers in Recent Conchological Science. 1662–1858.|journal=Journal of Conchology|author=J. Cosmo Melville, M.A., F.L.S.|volume=6|date=Jan 1890|pages=190–223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-4KAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA190}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Say]] wrote the fundamental work ''[[American Conchology, or Descriptions of the Shells of North America, Illustrated From Coloured Figures From Original Drawings, Executed from Nature]]'' in six volumes (1830–1834).

[[R. Tucker Abbott]] was the most prominent conchologist of the 20th century. He authored dozens of books and was [[museum director]] of the [[Bailey-Matthews Shell Museum]], bringing the world of seashells to the public. His most prominent works are ''[[American Seashells]]'', ''[[Seashells of the World]]'', and ''[[The Kingdom of the Seashell]]''.

Many of the finest collections of seashells are private. [[John DuPont]] and [[Jack Lightbourne]] are known for their extensive collections. John DuPont donated his shell collection to the [[Delaware Museum of Natural History]] in 1984. Emperor [[Hirohito]] of Japan also amassed a huge collection, and was a competent and respected amateur conchologist.

== Museums ==
Many museums worldwide contain very large and scientifically important mollusc collections. However, in most cases these are research collections, behind the scenes of the museum, and thus not readily accessible to the general public in the same way that exhibits are.

The largest assemblage of mollusc shells is housed at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] which has millions of lots representing perhaps 50,000 species, versus about 35,000 species for the largest private collections.

=== USA ===
* [[Academy of Natural Sciences]], [[Philadelphia]]
* [[American Museum of Natural History]], [[New York City]]
* [[Bailey-Matthews Shell Museum]] in [[Sanibel Island]], [[Florida]]: the only museum in the world dedicated entirely to shells.
* Charleston Marine Life Center, [[Oregon Institute of Marine Biology]] in Charleston [[Oregon]]
* [[Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science]], [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]: approximately 17,500 shell lots.
* [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]] at Harvard, [[Massachusetts]]
* [[National Museum of Natural History]], [[Washington D.C.]] – The Smithsonian Museum of Natural History has one of, if not the, finest shell collection in the world

=== Europe ===
* [[Austria]], [[Vienna]] – [[Naturhistorisches Museum]]
* [[Belgium]], [[Brussels]] – [[Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences]], one of the three largest collections
* [[France]], [[Paris]] – [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Muséum national d'histoire naturelle]]

== Fake shells ==
Shell collectors who purchase shells from dealers may sometimes encounter shells which have been altered to represent new species or rare color varieties.&lt;ref name="Ref_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conchology.be/en/shelltopics/fakeshells/ |title=Shells For Sale « The Largest Official Seashells Website, Conchology, Inc |publisher=Conchology.be |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that in previous centuries, fake examples of ''[[Epitonium scalare]]'' were created out of [[wheatpaste|rice paste]].&lt;ref name="Ref_b"&gt;Abbott, R. Tucker. Seashells of the world a guide to the better-known species. New York: Golden P, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Depictions of shells on stamps and coins ==
Shells have been featured on over 5,000 [[postage stamp]]s worldwide.

Shells have also been featured on many coins, including the [[Bahamian dollar]] (1974), the [[Cuban peso]] (1981), the [[Haitian gourde]] (1973), the [[Nepalese rupee]] (1989) and [[Philippine peso]] (1993).

[http://ineducation.couros.ca/index.php/ineducation/article/view/44/509]&lt;/ref&gt;  The growth of digital media means that the main areas of scholarship can each benefit from expansions in their own way thanks to the infinite sharability of digital content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1  = Feeney| first1 = Mary| last2  = Ross| first2 = Seamus| lastauthoramp = yes| title   = Information Technology in Humanities Scholarship, British Achievements, Prospects, and Barriers | journal = Historical Social Research| volume  = 19| issue   = 1 (69)| year    = 1994| pages = 3–59| jstor = 20755828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In education, the main areas of relevance are science, technology, engineering and math.  It is said that students learn best in a classroom when they are actively engaged.  The emergence of digital scholarship and digital media allows for another means for students to become engaged.  Key areas of academia that digital media is used on are to illustrate concepts, model displays and reinforce 21st century skills.&lt;ref&gt;Teachers' domain: digital media (including video!) resources for the STEM classroom and collection. 2010. Knowledgeable Quest, 39 (2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics cite concerns about the legitimacy, accessibility and verifiability of digital scholarship and the erosion of authors' rights as reasons to be concerned about digital scholarship. As scholarly communication evolves, controversy over the definition and value of the term "digital scholarship" is likely to continue.

Digital scholarship must take all of cultural, economic, personal, and institutional responsibilities to take its position as academic scholarship and to realize the core purpose of higher education with the possibilities of our time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ayers|first=Edward L.|title=Does Digital Scholarship Have a Future?|url=https://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ERM1343.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual property==
Concerns with how to regulate digital scholarship have arisen across universities across the world. The explosion in availability and creation of scholarly works has led many universities to adjust their policies on how they will manage scholarship in the future. These universities feel pressured to take action because digital technologies have led to the easy reproduction and commodification of these creations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=Sheri|title=Intellectual Property Policies in Academe: Issues and Concerns with Digital Scholarship|journal=Proceedings of the Charleston Library Conference|year=2012|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1389&amp;context=charleston|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities are unclear how to address the copyrighting of online classes and media presentations. Current law does not cover these specific areas of media produced in the academic world.&lt;ref name=IP&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=Sheri V.T.|title=Intellectual Property Policies in Academe: Issues and Concerns with Digital Scholarship|journal=Proceedings of the Charleston Library Conference|year=2012|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1389&amp;context=charleston|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past any printed work done by professors was considered their intellectual property, but now the question stands as to who owns these different forms of multimedia. One of the main concerns of faculty is that universities will soon take ownership of this digital media.

Universities have taken a growing interest in creations that have revenue-generating potential, like online classes or lecture slides, while also showing concern for products that may be used by comparable institutions, potentially reducing their competitive advantage.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; In order to stay on top of others academically, universities have sought to keep the intellectual property created within the university away from others schools. Not only are universities using digital scholarship to make money and stay ahead, but they also have interests in protecting their brand.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt;

While universities attempt to protect digital scholarship, it is in many professors best interests for their creations to be seen by the world as to grow their brand and acclaim as a professor. Laws that may apply to digital scholarship are largely outdated but professors would like to use the argument of faculty ownership of traditional works as historical practice and practice compatible with mission of higher education as a public good.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; Professors argue that it took time and serious effort to make the presentations, slides, media.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; To date professors have been rarely questioned whether they have the right to bring their course outlines, lecture outlines, and lecture notes with them if they decide to leave the university where they created them.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; Change over the ability of professors to bring digital scholarship with them is expected as universities have begun to take notice and assert copyrights.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; Professors will argue that since they are the creators and authors of the product they are the owners according to law.

As of now most copyright laws in America indicate that the author or creator holds the copyright, but the same cannot be said for digital scholarship. The law explicitly states that if the work is within the scope of his or her employment then the work is the property of the employer.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; Since the employer here would be the university, professors are technically creating [[work for hire]]. While faculty of universities appear to not be credited for their work, the primary reason for a university to take ownership of a faculty's work is that the member created the work using university funds mostly.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; Solutions to the lack of clear laws regarding ownership of digital scholarship are not currently being created but many universities have created written contracts with professors over who owns future work or what they can do with previous work.

For example, in the U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[Stanford v. Roche]]'', the court decided that Roche, a former Stanford researcher, was a co-owner with Stanford of patents for testing kits to detect  HIV.&lt;ref name=Stand&gt;{{cite web|last=Lapin|first=Lisa|title=Stanford 'disappointed' in Supreme Court ruling in Roche case|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2011/june/court-roche-ruling-060711.html|publisher=Stanford News|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this case does not deal with digital scholarship directly, it deals with the ownership of intellectual property of university employees when they leave. This case will set a precedent for future decisions with online classes, lecture notes, and outlines.

==NEA Policy==
The [[National Education Association]] (NEA), the largest professional educational association in the United States, updated its policy on digital learning in 2013. The policy stresses that students need to develop "advanced critical thinking and information literacy skills and master new digital tools," as well as "the initiative to become self-directed learners while adapting to the ever-changing digital information landscape." The NEA also believes that digital learning creates an environment in which learning can be more individualized to meet the needs of each student. The NEA mandates that all public schools must do their best to acquire necessary modern technologies and constantly revise teaching plans to incorporate technology where viable to best prepare students for the 21st century. The NEA's digital learning policy also states that technology must be used in an adaptive manner as to not become a distraction and to remain a tool, as well as that technology should not become a replacement for instructors, merely a supplement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NEA Policy Statement on Digital Learning|url=http://www.nea.org/home/55434.htm|publisher=National Education Association|accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7772">'''Disproportionation''', sometimes called dismutation, is a [[redox reaction]] in which a compound of intermediate oxidation state converts to two different compounds, one of higher and one of lower oxidation states.&lt;ref&gt;Shriver, D. F.; Atkins, P. W.; Overton, T. L.; Rourke, J. P.; Weller, M. T.; Armstrong, F. A. “Inorganic Chemistry” W. H. Freeman, New York, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7167-4878-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although not widely accepted, disproportionation is sometimes used to describe any desymmetrizing reaction of the following type: 2 A → A'  +  A", regardless of any redox process.&lt;ref&gt;https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/D/D01799.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[Mercury(I) chloride]] disproportionates upon UV-irradiation:
:Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Hg + HgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Phosphorous acid]] disproportionates upon heating to give [[phosphoric acid]] and [[phosphine]]:
:4 {{chem|H|3|PO|3}} →  3 H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

As mentioned above, desymmetrizing reactions are sometimes referred to as disproportionation, as illustrated by the thermal degradation of bicarbonate:
:2 {{chem|HCO|3|-}} → {{chem|CO|3|2-}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
The oxidation numbers remain constant in this acid-base reaction.  This process is also called autoionization.

Another variant on disproportionation is [[radical disproportionation]], in which two radicals form an alkane and alkene.

===Reverse reaction===
The reverse of disproportionation, when a compound in an intermediate oxidation state is formed from precursors of lower and higher oxidation states, is called [[comproportionation]], also known as synproportionation.

==History==
The first disproportionation reaction to be studied in detail was:

:2 Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; → Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; + Sn

This was examined using [[tartrate]]s by [[Johan Gadolin]] in 1788. In the Swedish  version of his paper he called it 'söndring'.&lt;ref&gt;Gadolin Johan (1788) ''K. Sv. Vet. Acad. Handl.'' 1788, 186-197.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gadolin Johan (1790) ''Crells Chem. Annalen'' 1790, I, 260-273.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further examples ==
*[[Chlorine]] gas reacts with dilute [[sodium hydroxide]] to form [[sodium chloride]], [[sodium chlorate]] and [[water]]. The ionic equation for this reaction is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Charlie Harding, David Arthur Johnson, Rob Janes, (2002), ''Elements of the P Block'', Published by Royal Society of Chemistry, {{ISBN|0-85404-690-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:3 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 5 Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + ClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:*The chlorine gas reactant is in [[oxidation state]] 0. In the products, the chlorine in the Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion has an oxidation number of −1, having been reduced, whereas the oxidation number of the chlorine in the ClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; ion is +5, indicating that it has been oxidized.

*Bromine fluoride undergoes disproportionation reaction for form bromine trifluoride:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Non Aqueous Media|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: 3 BrF   → BrF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

*The dismutation of [[superoxide]] [[free radical]] to [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[oxygen]], catalysed in living systems by the [[enzyme]] [[superoxide dismutase]]:
: 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:The oxidation state of oxygen is −1/2 in the superoxide free radical anion, −1 in hydrogen peroxide and 0 in dioxygen.

*In the [[Cannizzaro reaction]], an [[aldehyde]] is converted into an [[alcohol]] and a [[carboxylic acid]]. In the related [[Tishchenko reaction]], the [[organic redox reaction]] product is the corresponding [[ester]]. In the [[Kornblum–DeLaMare rearrangement]], a peroxide is converted to a [[ketone]] and an alcohol.

*The disproportionation  of [[hydrogen peroxide]] into water and oxygen catalysed by either [[potassium iodide]] or the enzyme [[catalase]]:
: 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

*The [[Boudouard reaction]] is for example used in the [[HiPco]] method for producing [[Carbon Nanotube|carbon nanotubes]], high-pressure [[carbon monoxide]] disproportionates when catalysed on the surface of an iron particle:
: 2 CO → C + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

*[[Nitrogen]] has oxidation state +4 in [[nitrogen dioxide]], but when this compound reacts with water, it forms both [[nitric acid]] and [[nitrous acid]], where nitrogen has oxidation states +5 and +3 respectively:
: 2 NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

*[[Dithionite]] undergoes acid hydrolysis to [[thiosulfate]] and [[bisulfite]]:{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}
:2 {{chem|S|2|O|4|2−}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} → {{chem|S|2|O|3|2−}} + 2 {{chem|H|S|O|3|−}}
:*Dithionite also undergoes alkaline hydrolysis to [[sulfite]] and [[sulfide]]:{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}
:3 {{chem|Na|2|S|2|O|4}} + 6 {{chem|Na|O|H}} → 5 {{chem|Na|2|S|O|3}} + {{chem|Na|2|S}} + 3 {{chem|H|2|O}}

== Biochemistry ==
In 1937, [[Hans Adolf Krebs]], who discovered the [[citric acid cycle]] bearing his name, confirmed the anaerobic dismutation of [[pyruvic acid]] in [[lactic acid]], [[acetic acid]] and [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] by certain bacteria according to the global reaction:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Krebs | first = H.A. | year = 1937 |title = LXXXVIII - Dismutation of pyruvic acid in gonoccus and staphylococcus | journal = Biochem. J. | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 661–671 | pmc = 1266985 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1266985/pdf/biochemj01050-0180.pdf | pmid=16746383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 pyruvic acid + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → lactic acid + acetic acid + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The dismutation of pyruvic acid in other small organic molecules (ethanol + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or lactate and acetate, depending on the environmental conditions) is also an important step in [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] reactions. Fermentation reactions can also be considered as disproportionation or dismutation [[biochemical reaction]]s. Indeed, the [[electron donor|donor]] and [[electron acceptor|acceptor]] of electrons in the [[redox reaction]]s supplying the [[chemical energy]] in these complex biochemical systems are the same organic molecules simultaneously acting as [[reductant]] or [[oxidant]].

Another example of biochemical dismutation reaction is the disproportionation of [[acetaldehyde]] into [[ethanol]] and [[acetic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jb.asm.org/cgi/reprint/173/21/7012.pdf   Biochemical basis of mitochondrial acetaldehyde dismutation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae]&lt;/ref&gt;

While in [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] electrons are transferred from [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] ([[electron donor]]) to an [[electron acceptor]], in fermentation part of the substrate molecule itself accepts the electrons. Fermentation is therefore a type of disproportionation, and does not involve an overall change in [[oxidation state]] of the substrate. Most of the fermentative substrates are organic molecules. However, a rare type of fermentation may also involve the disproportionation of inorganic [[sulfur]] compounds in certain [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v326/n6116/abs/326891a0.html A novel type of energy metabolism involving fermentation of inorganic sulfur compounds.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Environmental and Energy Study Institute''' '''(EESI)''' is an independent, [[Bipartisanship|bi-partisan]] [[501(c)(3) non-profit organization|501(c)(3) non-profit]] organization that aims to promote environmentally sustainable societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://greatnonprofits.org/org/environmental-and-energy-study-institute-eesi|title=Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) nonprofit in Washington, DC {{!}} Volunteer, Read Reviews, Donate {{!}} GreatNonprofits|website=greatnonprofits.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based out of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]], EESI seeks to be a catalyst moving society away from environmentally damaging [[fossil fuel]]s and toward a [[Sustainable energy|clean energy]] future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Hidden Cost of Fossil Fuels|url = http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/our-energy-choices/coal-and-other-fossil-fuels/the-hidden-cost-of-fossil.html#.VkUK7rerSM8|website = Union of Concerned Scientists|accessdate = 2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was established in 1984 by a bipartisan and bicameral group of members of the [[United States Congress]] who were concerned with global [[Environmental policy|environmental]] and [[energy]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Environmental And Energy Study Institute (Eesi) nonprofit in Washington, DC {{!}} Volunteer, Read Reviews, Donate {{!}} GreatNonprofits|url = http://greatnonprofits.org/org/environmental-and-energy-study-institute-eesi|website = greatnonprofits.org|accessdate = 2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EESI works to advance policy solutions that reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and ground-level [[air pollution]]; improve  [[public health]], [[energy security]], and economic development opportunities; and increase use of [[renewable energy]] and [[energy conservation|energy efficiency]].

The group seeks to advance its mission through policymaker education, coalition building, and policy development.

==Formation==
EESI grew out of the Environmental Study Conference, a bipartisan and bicameral Congressional caucas originally launched in 1975 by former Congressman [[Richard Ottinger|Richard (Dick) Ottinger]], [[H. John Heinz III|John Heinz]], and [[Gilbert Gude]]. Because the Conference was unable to support its work entirely on Congressional funds and rules prohibited the receipt of outside financial support, in 1984 the leadership of the Study Conference launched an independent non-profit, the Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) to continue the Conference's mission to provide information and policy resources to Congress on energy and environmental issues. EESI was established as a separate and distinct 501(c)(3) non-profit, overseen by an independent board of directors, which included several Members of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Us {{!}} EESI|url = http://www.eesi.org/about|website = www.eesi.org|accessdate = 2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founders of the Institute were: [[Anthony C. Beilenson]] (D-CA), [[George Brown, Jr.]] (D-CA), [[Bob Edgar]] (D-PA), [[Joseph L. Fisher]] (D-VA), [[S. William Green]] (R-NY), [[Gilbert Gude]] (R-MD), [[John Heinz]] (R-PA), [[James M. Jeffords]] (R-VT), [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-VT), [[Paul N. McCloskey, Jr.]] (R-CA), [[Richard L. Ottinger]] (D-NY), [[Claudine Schneider]] (R-RI), [[John F. Seiberling]] (D-OH), [[Vin Weber]] (R-MN), [[Howard Wolpe]] (D-MI), [[Louis Stokes]] (D-OH), [[Augustus Hawkins]] (D-CA), [[John Chafee]] (R-RI), [[Slade Gorton]] (R-WA), [[Gary Hart]] (D-CO)

==Areas of Work==
'''Federal Policy'''

EESI supports policy changes and strategies that will allow the United States and other countries to mitigate climate change, while also reaping the environmental, economic, national security, and public health benefits of [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and renewable energy technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Remarks on Climate Change and National Security|url = https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/11/249393.htm|website = U.S. Department of State|accessdate = 2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Assessing the Multiple Benefits of Clean Energy {{!}} Resources {{!}} State and Local {{!}} US EPA|url = http://www3.epa.gov/statelocalclimate/resources/benefits.html|website = www3.epa.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-12|first = US EPA, Office, Real org responsible for content spelled|last = out}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, this means encouraging federal policymakers to enact legislation  and policies promoting renewable energy, energy efficiency and the phasing out of harmful climate pollutants. EESI promotes policies that have bipartisan appeal in a wide range of areas, including buildings, climate change, communities, energy efficiency, industry, public health, renewable energy, rural issues, and transportation.

'''On-Bill Financing'''

In addition to its federal policy work, EESI launched a community-focused energy efficiency program in 2014, following several years of work on a pilot program in [[South Carolina]] (starting in 2010). The On-Bill Financing Project is an ongoing initiative aimed at helping families reduce energy use, cut energy bills, and improve home comfort through an innovative financing approach known as on-bill financing. Participating organizations provide their customers with loans for home energy upgrades, such as better [[Home insulation|insulation]] or more energy-efficient heating and cooling systems. These loans are then repaid through a monthly charge on the customer's [[Public utility|utility]] bill. When the program is properly designed, the savings resulting from the energy efficiency upgrades outweigh the cost of the loan, and the customer saves money every month.

EESI's on-bill financing initiative has expanded into a national effort to significantly improve the energy efficiency of homes served by rural electric [http://www.nreca.coop/about-electric-cooperatives/ cooperatives] and public power utilities. Because the approach involves no money down (and can be designed to be cash-flow positive), it can work for low-income families that are unable to take advantage of [[Tax refund|rebates]] or other efficiency incentives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EESI's On-Bill Financing Project {{!}} EESI|url = http://www.eesi.org/obf/main|website = www.eesi.org|accessdate = 2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Briefings and Publications==
'''Briefings'''

EESI holds between 25 and 30 Congressional briefings every year to inform [[Congressional staff]]ers, the federal policymaking community, and the public at large about energy and environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Briefings {{!}} EESI|url = http://www.eesi.org/briefings|website = www.eesi.org|accessdate = 2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These briefings bring experts from government, industry, and civil society to Capitol Hill for bipartisan discussions on cutting-edge research, success stories, lessons learned, and stakeholder feedback.

Briefing topics have included [[Energy development#Resilience|resilience]], national security issues, water issues, energy efficiency, [[solar power]], [[wind power]], [[Geothermal energy|geothermal power]], [[hydropower]], [[fuel cell]]s and [[hydrogen energy]], [[biofuel]]s and [[biomass]], clean energy financing, deploying [[electric vehicle]]s, mass transit, walkable cities, climate change impacts, [http://www.unep.org/ccac/Short-LivedClimatePollutants/Definitions/tabid/130285/Default.aspx short-lived climate pollutants], transmission and the power grid, district energy, and [[Distributed generation|microgrids]].

EESI briefings are free, held on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., and most are open to the public. In 2013, EESI began livestreaming most of its briefings.

'''Publications'''

EESI periodically publishes web articles, issue briefs, and fact sheets on environmental and energy issues and related legislation. Additionally, EESI distributes two weekly newsletters: "[http://www.eesi.org/newsletters/climate-change-news-ccn Climate Change News]" (CCN), featuring the main climate-related science, business, and policy stories of the week; and "[http://www.eesi.org/newsletters/sustainable-bioenergy-farms-and-forests-sbff Sustainable Bioenergy, Farms, and Forests]" (SBFF), focusing on policy developments in [[bioenergy]] and sustainable land use.

All EESI publications and newsletters are distributed free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Publications {{!}} EESI|url = http://www.eesi.org/publications|website = www.eesi.org|accessdate = 2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology}}
'''Ethnohistory''' is the study of cultures and [[indigenous peoples]]' customs by examining historical records as well as other sources of information on their lives and history. It is also the study of the history of various [[ethnic group]]s that may or may not still exist. The term is most commonly used in writing about the [[history of the Americas]].

Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation. Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts. Practitioners recognize the use of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, folklore, oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and placenames.&lt;ref name="Axtell1979"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Axtell | first1 = J. | year = 1979 | title = Ethnohistory: An Historian's Viewpoint | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 3–4 | doi=10.2307/481465| jstor = 481465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical development ==
Scholars studying the history of [[Mexico]]'s indigenous have a long tradition, dating back to the colonial era; they used alphabetic texts and other sources to write the history of Mexico's indigenous peoples. The ''[[Handbook of Middle American Indians]]'', edited by archeologist [[Robert Wauchope (archaeologist)|Robert Wauchope]] was involved with creating a multiple volumes on [[Mesoamerican]] ethnohistory, published as ''Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', appearing in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Middle American Indians, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', volumes 12-16, Howard F. Cline, general editor. Austin: University of Texas Press 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time that the volumes were published, "both the term 'ethnohistory' and its concepts in the sense used here have entered the literature rather recently and are not fully agreed upon."&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "Introduction: Reflections on Ethnohistory" in ''Handbook of Middle American Indians, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', vol. 12, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The volumes were intended to be an inventory of sources "which in later hands could utilize to produce professionally acceptable ethnohistory."&lt;ref&gt;Cline, "Introduction: Reflections on Ethnohistory", p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid to late 20th century, a number of ethnohistorians of Mexico began to systematically publish many colonial alphabetic texts in indigenous Mexican languages, in a branch of ethnohistory currently known as the [[New Philology]]. That built on an earlier tradition of practitioners writing the [[history of Mexico]] that fully integrated the history of its indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, "[[Charles Gibson]] and the Ethnohistory of Postconquesst Central Mexico" in ''Nahuas and Spaniards: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology.'' Stanford University Press and UCLA Latin American Studies, vol. 76. 1991, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restall, Matthew, "A History of the New Philology and the New Philology in History", ''Latin American Research Review'' - Volume 38, Number 1, 2003, pp.113–134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html | title=Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory, Provisional Version, James Lockhart, Lisa Sousa, and Stephanie Wood, editors (2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the field arose out of the study of American Indian communities required by the [[Indian Claims Commission]]. It gained a pragmatic rather than a theoretical orientation, with practitioners testifying both for and against Indian claims. The emerging methodology used documentary historical sources and ethnographic methods. Among the scholars working on the cases was Latin Americanist [[Howard F. Cline]], who was commissioned to work on Florda Indians and [[Jicarilla Apache]].  

The field has also reached into [[Melanesia]], where recent European contact allowed researchers to observe the early postcontact period directly and to address important theoretical questions. [[Michael Harkin]] argues that ethnohistory was part of the general rapprochement between history and anthropology in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Harkin, "Ethnohistory's Ethnohistory," ''Social Science History,'' Summer 2010, Vol. 34#2 pp 113-128&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnohistory grew organically thanks to external nonscholarly pressures, without an overarching figure or conscious plan; even so, it came to engage central issues in cultural and historical analysis. Ethnohistorians take pride in using their special knowledge of specific groups, their linguistic insights, and their interpretation of cultural phenomena. They claim to achieve a more in-depth analysis than the average historian is capable of doing based solely on written documents produced by and for one group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lurie | first1 = N. | year = 1961 | title = Ethnohistory: An Ethnological Point of View | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 8 | issue = 1| page = 83 | doi=10.2307/480349| jstor = 480349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They try to understand culture on its own terms and according to its own cultural code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/482586 | last1 = DeMallie | first1 = Raymond J. | year = 1993 | title = These Have No Ears": Narrative and the Ethnohistorical Method | jstor = 482586| journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 515–538}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnohistory differs from other historically-related [[methodology|methodologies]] in that it embraces [[emic]] perspectives as tools of analysis. The field and its techniques are well suited for writing histories of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] peoples because of its holistic and inclusive framework. It is especially important because of its ability to bridge differing frameworks and access a more informed context for interpretations of the past.

The definition of the field has become more refined over the years. Early on, ethnohistory differed from history proper in that it added a new dimension, specifically "the critical use of ethnological concepts and materials in the examination and use of historical source material," as described by [[William N. Fenton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fenton | first1 = W. N. | year = 1966 | title = Field Work, Museum Studies, and Ethnohistorical Research | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 13 | issue = 1/2| page = 75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[James Axtell]] described ethnohistory as "the use of historical and ethnological methods to gain knowledge of the nature and causes of change in a culture defined by ethnological concepts and categories."&lt;ref name="Axtell1979" /&gt; Others have focused this basic concept on previously ignored historical actors. [[Ed Schieffelin]] asserted, for example, that ethnohistory must fundamentally take into account the people's own sense of how events are constituted, and their ways of culturally constructing the past.&lt;ref&gt;Schieffelin, E. and D. Gewertz (1985), ''History and Ethnohistory in Papua New Guinea'', 3&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Simmons formulated his understanding of ethnohistory as "a form of cultural biography that draws upon as many kinds of testimony as possible over as long a time period as the sources allow." He described ethnohistory as an endeavor based on a [[holistic]], [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] approach that is most rewarding when it can be "joined to the memories and voices of living people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simmons | first1 = W. S. | year = 1988 | title = Culture Theory in Contemporary Ethnohistory | url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/2k09f06d| journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 35 | issue = 1| page = 10 | doi=10.2307/482430| jstor = 482430 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting upon the history of ethnohistory as research field in the US, Harkin has situated it within the broader context of convergences and divergences of the fields of history and anthropology and the special circumstances of American Indian land claims and legal history in North American in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1215/01455532-2009-022 | last1 = Harkin | first1 = Michael | year = 2010 | title = Ethnohistory's Ethnohistory: Creating a Discipline from the Ground Up | url = | journal = Social Science History | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 113–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''funerary cult''' is a body of [[anthropology of religion|religious]] teaching and practice centered on the [[veneration of the dead]], in which the living are thought to be able to confer benefits on the dead in the [[afterlife]] or to appease their otherwise wrathful [[ghost]]s. Rituals were carried on for the benefit of the dead, either by their relatives or by a class of [[priest]]s appointed and paid to perform the rites. These rituals took place at the [[tomb]]s of the dead themselves or at [[mortuary temple]]s appointed to this purpose. Funerary cults are found in a wide variety of cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Yayoi Shirai, "Ideal and reality in Old Kingdom private funerary cults", in ''The Old Kingdom Art and Archaeology'', Miroslav Bárta, ed.;  (Czech Institute of Egyptology, 2004), pp. [http://www.gizapyramids.org/pdf%20library/shirai_okaa_2006.pdf 325 et. seq.], accessed June 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable cults==

===Egypt===
Funerary cults are especially associated with [[ancient Egypt]], where it was common for royalty, those associated with royalty, cats, and the wealthy to be mummified. This practice was done so as to preserve their bodies for the journey to the afterlife. The [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] [[Osiris]], who was the [[dying and reviving god]] and Lord of the Egyptian afterlife, was usually depicted as a [[mummy]] in [[Egyptian art]]. Also at [[Bubastis]], where Bast was worshiped, there was a massive cat cemetery. Cats were also thought to journey to the afterlife, usually to join their owners. These needed their own material goods for this journey, such as food.&lt;ref&gt;(p50 1910 encyclopedia  Britannica)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Empire===
The [[Roman Empire]] also had a funerary cult, revolving around Dionysus.  Dionysus, (along with being lord of wine and parties) had been reborn many times and had rescued his mother Semele from the Underworld (the Roman afterlife, ruled by Hades). Each [[Roman God]] had his or her own clique of devotees, and it was thought that Dionysus could protect his initiates from death. He was also one of the Gods associated with plants (grapes in particular) and harvest.  He was occasionally depicted in conjunction with other Gods (representatives of rebirth or plants of some kind) to indicate the dead also participated in the rejuvenation of the seasons.&lt;ref&gt;(The cults of the Roman Empire By Robert Turcan, p 312-313)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesopotamia===
In [[Sumer]], [[Assyria]], and [[Babylonia]], funerary cults were called ''kispu.'' This funerary cult mostly revolved around caring for deceased kin, with a specific family member assigned to providing for a specific ghost. The ghosts were provided with food and other goods, however the provision of clean water was of particular importance. Both deceased men and women were supposed to receive this care.  Without this care, the dead had the potential to become a malicious supernatural force.  With this care, the dead family continue to participate in the lives of the living family. Also, the practice of recycling the names of the deceased allowed for familial continuity. In Assyria, this was done by any consanguineal kin. A Babylonian variation of this cult treats the veneration of the dead as an extension of the veneration for parents. Offspring were responsible for this care. Scholar Miranda Bayliss had stated the function of this cult was to alleviate guilt and other tensions from the death of the deceased and form solidarity and continuity within the family. Typically only close kin received this care. When ancestors beyond the individual's grandparents were venerated, it was done at large gatherings of extended kin groups. This also functioned to promote solidarity within the larger kin group.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Bayliss, "The Cult of Dead Kin in Assyria and Babylonia", ''Iraq'', v. 35, no. 2. seq.[https://www.jstor.org/pss/4199959]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bram Jagersma, "The Calendar of the Funerary Cult in Ancient Lagash", ''Bibliotheca Orientalis'', v.: 64 nos: 3-4, pp 289-307 [http://poj.peeters-leuven.be/content.php?id=2023945&amp;url=article]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
The ancient [[Greek hero cult]] was also a funerary cult; in the original sense, a ''[[hero]]'' was a deified or [[demigod|semi-divine]] ancestor, worshiped at a shrine for his power to assist the living. The ancient Greek religion had three main aspect: the Gods, the heroes, and the dead. The dead are powerless and the Gods all-powerful, while the heroes are dead (live only in legend and memory) and are powerful. Heroes occupy a liminal space between the Gods and mortals. Mortals sacrificed livestock and plants at Heroes' tombs to intervene and commune with the Gods on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;A companion to Greek Religion, by Daniel Ogden, p113-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian Peninsula===
The [[Samnium|Samnite]]s and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] of the Italian peninsula, who painted the underworld deities [[Aita]], [[Vanth]], [[Phersipnei]], and Letham on the walls of tombs.&lt;ref&gt;G. Schneider-Herrmann, Gisela Schneider-Herrmann, Edward Herring, Accordia Research Centre, ''The Samnites of the Fourth Century BC'' (Institute of Classical Studies, School of Advanced Study, University of London [and] Accordia Research Centre, 1996; {{ISBN|0-900587-64-4}}), pp. 109-125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14942">'''Iconology''' is a method of interpretation in cultural history and the history of art used by [[Aby Warburg]], [[Erwin Panofsky]] and their followers that uncovers the cultural, social, and historical background of themes and subjects in the visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;Roelof van Straten, ''An Introduction to Iconography: Symbols, Allusions and Meaning in the Visual Arts''. Abingdon and New York 1994, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is derived from synthesis rather than scattered analysis and examines symbolic meaning on more than its face value by reconciling it with its historical context and with the artist's body of work&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biddingtons.com/content/pedigreeicon.html Iconography and Iconology]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; in contrast to the widely descriptive [[iconography]], which, as described by Panofsky, is an approach to studying the content and meaning of works of art that is primarily focused on classifying, establishing dates, provenance and other necessary fundamental knowledge concerning the subject matter of an artwork that is needed for further interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Ljunggren Szepessy, "Panofsky - Iconology and Iconography". In ''The Marriage Maker: The Pergamon Hermaphrodite as the God Hermaphroditos, Divine Ideal and Erotic Object''. MA thesis, University of Oslo 2014, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Panofsky strongly differentiated between iconology and iconography, the distinction is not very widely followed, "and they have never been given definitions accepted by all iconographers and iconologists".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0161.xml Oxford Bibliographies: Paul Taylor, "Iconology and Iconography"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Few 21st-century authors continue to use the term consistently.

It should also be noted that Panofsky's "use of iconology as the principle tool of art analysis brought him critics." For instance, in 1946, [[Jan Gerrit Van Gelder]] "criticized Panofsky's iconology as putting too much emphasis on the symbolic content of the work of art, neglecting its formal aspects and the work as a unity of form and content."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthistorians.info/panofskye Dictionary of Art Historians: Panofsky, Erwin]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, iconology is mostly avoided by social historians who do not accept the theoretical dogmaticism in the work of Panofsky.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus von Beyme, "Why is there no Political Science of the Arts?" In Udo J. Hebel and Christoph Wagner, eds., ''Pictorial Cultures and Political Iconographies: Approaches, Perspectives, Case Studies from Europe and America''. Berlin and New York 2011, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In contrast to iconography==
Erwin Panofsky defines iconography as "a known principle in the known world", while iconology is "an iconography turned interpretive".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Tudor, ''Image and Influence: Studies in the Sociology of Film''. New York 1974, p.115.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his view, iconology tries to reveal the underlying principles that form the basic attitude of a nation, a period, a class, a religious or philosophical perspective, which is modulated by one personality and condensed into one work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roelof van Straten, iconology "can explain why an artist or patron chose a particular subject at a specific location and time and represented it in a certain way. An iconological investigation should concentrate on the social-historical, not art-historical, influences and values that the artist might not have consciously brought into play but are nevertheless present. The artwork is primarily seen as a document of its time."&lt;ref&gt;Roelof van Straten, ''An Introduction to Iconography: Symbols, Allusions and Meaning in the Visual Arts''. Abingdon and New York 1994, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warburg used the term "iconography" in his early research, replacing it in 1908 with "iconology" in his particular method of visual interpretation called "critical iconology", which focused on the tracing of motifs through different cultures and visual forms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Hatt]] and Charlotte Klonk, "Iconography - iconology: Erwin Panofsky". In ''Art History: A Critical Introduction to Its Methods''. Manchester University Press, 2006, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Panofsky published a seminal article, introducing a three-step method of visual interpretation dealing with (1) primary or natural subject matter; (2) secondary or conventional subject matter, i.e. iconography; (3) tertiary or intrinsic meaning or content, i.e. iconology.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Panofsky, "Zum Problem der Beschreibung und Inhaltsdeutung von Werken der bildenden Kunst." ''Logos'', Vol. 21 (1932), pp. 103-119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas iconography analyses the world of images, stories and allegories and requires knowledge of literary sources, an understanding of the history of types and how themes and concepts were expressed by objects and events under different historical conditions, iconology interprets intrinsic meaning or content and the world of symbolical values by using "synthetic intuition". The interpreter is aware of the essential tendencies of the human mind as conditioned by psychology and world view; he analyses the history of cultural symptoms or symbols, or how tendencies of the human mind were expressed by specific themes due to different historical conditions. Moreover, when understanding the work of art as a document of a specific civilization, or of a certain religious attitude therein, the work of art becomes a symptom of something else, which expresses itself in a variety of other symptoms. Interpreting these symbolical values, which can be unknown to, or different from, the artist's intention, is the object of iconology.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Ljunggren Szepessy, "Panofsky - Iconology and Iconography". In ''The Marriage Maker: The Pergamon Hermaphrodite as the God Hermaphroditos, Divine Ideal and Erotic Object''. MA thesis, University of Oslo 2014, pp.13, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Panofsky emphasized that "iconology can be done when there are no originals to look at and nothing but artificial light to work in."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ann Holly, ''Panofsky and the Foundations of Art History''. Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1984, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ernst Gombrich]], "the emerging discipline of iconology ... must ultimately do for the image what linguistics has done for the word."&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Gombrich, ''Reflections on the History of Art: Views and Reviews'', ed. Richard Woodfield. Oxford 1987, p.246.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Michael Camille]] is of the opinion that "though Panofsky's concept of iconology has been very influential in the humanities and is quite effective when applied to Renaissance art, it is still problematic when applied to art from periods before and after."&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.arizona.edu/downloads/Garcia,_Dominique_Writing_Sample.pdf Dominique E. Garcia, "Nationalistic Iconography and 'Anti-Iconology' of the Aztec Coatlicue Sculpture"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuances==
In 1952, [[Creighton Gilbert]] added another opinion about the meaning of the word "iconology". According to his view, iconology was not the actual investigation of the work of art but rather the result of this investigation. The Austrian art historian [[Hans Sedlmayr]] differentiated between "sachliche" and "methodische" iconology. "Sachliche" iconology refers to the "general meaning of an individual painting or of an artistic complex (church, palace, monument) as seen and explained with reference to the ideas which take shape in them." In contrast, "methodische" iconology is the "integral iconography which accounts for the changes and development in the representations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3407705539/iconology-and-iconography.html Encyclopedia.com: Iconology and Iconography]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Iconology: Images, Text, Ideology'' (1986), [[W.J.T. Mitchell]] writes that iconology is a study of "what to say about images", concerned with the description and interpretation of visual art, and also a study of "what images say" – the ways in which they seem to speak for themselves by persuading, telling stories, or describing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iconictheory.blogspot.de/2010/05/iconology.html Karen Hope, The Iconic Image: Iconology]&lt;/ref&gt; He pleads for a postlinguistic, postsemiotic "iconic turn", emphasizing the role of "non-linguistic symbol systems".&lt;ref&gt;W.J.T. Mitchell, ''Iconology: Images, Text, Ideology''. University of Chicago Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://d-sites.net/english/mitchell.htm w.j.t. mitchell and the image (review)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.J.T. Mitchell, "Iconology and Ideology: Panofsky, Althusser, and the Scene of Recognition". In David B. Downing and Susan Bazargan, eds., ''Image and Ideology in Modern/Postmodern Discourse''. New York 1991, pp.321-329.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of just pointing out the difference between the material (pictorial or artistic) images, "he pays attention to the dialectic relationship between material images and mental images".&lt;ref&gt;[https://ksangmin.wordpress.com/2009/11/19/w-j-t-mitchell-iconology-and-picture-theory/ W. J. T. Mitchell's Iconology and Picture Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dennise Bartelo and Robert Morton, the term "iconology" can also be used for characterizing "a movement toward seeing connections across all the language processes" and the idea about "multiple levels and forms used to communicate meaning" in order to get "the total picture” of learning. "Being both literate in the traditional sense and visually literate are the true mark of a well-educated human."&lt;ref&gt;[http://wac.colostate.edu/journal/vol8/bartelo_morton.pdf Dennise Bartelo and Robert Morton, "Iconology: An Alternate Form of Writing"]&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years, new approaches to iconology have developed in the theory of images. This is the case of what [[Jean-Michel Durafour]], French philosopher and theorist of cinema, proposed to call "econology", a biological approach to images as forms of life, crossing iconology, ecology and sciences of nature. In an econological regime, the image (''eikon'') self-speciates, that is to say, it self-iconicizes with others and eco-iconicizes with them its iconic habitat (''oikos''). The iconology, mainly Warburghian iconology, is thus merged with a conception of the relations between the beings of the nature inherited, among others ([[Arne Næss]], etc.) from the writings of [[Kinji Imanishi]]. For Imanishi, living beings are subjects. Or, more precisely, the environment and the living being are juste one. One of the main consequences is that the "specity", the living individual, "self-eco-speciates its place of life" (''Freedom in Evolution''). As far as the images are concerned: "If the living species self-specify, the images self-iconicize. This is not a tautology. The images update some of their iconic virtualities. They live in the midst of other images, past or present, but also future (those are only human classifications), which they have relations with. They self-iconicize in an iconic environment which they interact with, and which in particular makes them the images they are. Or more precisely, insofar as images have an active part: ''the images self-eco-iconicize their iconic environment''.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Durafour, ''"L'Étrange Créature du lac noir" de Jack Arnold. Aubades pour une zoologie des images'', Aix-en-Provence, Rouge profond, 2017, 200 p. ({{ISBN|978-2915083910}}), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;"

==Studies in iconology==
''Studies in Iconology'' is the title of a book by Erwin Panofsky on humanistic themes in the art of the Renaissance, which was first published in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of a peer-reviewed series of books started in 2014 under the editorship of [[Barbara Baert]] and published by Peeters international academic publishers, [[Leuven]], Belgium, addressing the deeper meaning of the visual medium throughout human history in the fields of philosophy, art history, theology and cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peeters-leuven.be/search_serie_book.asp?nr=284 Peeters Publishers: Studies in Iconology]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixing and matching is the unavoidable process in the making of inner connections and the presentations of interculturalities. The majority of the works in intercultural theatre deal basically with thinking and doing around the themes, stories, pre-performative or performative concepts of Asian classical theatre or traditional performing arts forms and practices, mixing and matching the concepts or the ideas of the foreign.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0415092167 "Theatre world performance politics culture"]&lt;/ref&gt; After the well-known success of Peter Brook's production of the Mahabharata,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smith.edu/metamorphoses/issues/links/hellwegpeter.html "Metamorphoses"]&lt;/ref&gt; the trend has been evolving tremendously around the globe and many the cultural institutions of many governments have become directly interested in pushing the boundaries of intercultural senses and sensitivities by financially investing on new theatrical productions, university research, conferences and fellowships&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuigalway.ie/about-us/news-and-events/news-archive "SUSI Grants"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The three major groups of intercultural theatre ==

===Imitational theatre===
The intended audience is from the same culture, or a foreign audience from a different culture and the theater group, or the actors or performers, come from the same cultural background or from very diverse foreign cultural backgrounds. The production may imitate foreign styles, the production procedures may introduce new techniques, a new style of acting or a new style of presentation for a group of actors from various cultures or the same culture, the production may include foreign languages, costumes, scenic themes and other aspects. There are many examples of intercultural theatre groups, people, and institutions who are experimenting with various levels of mixing and matching of traditional or contemporary aspects of theatre training and presentations in this type of Imitational Theatre. 

After the global acceptance of renowned theatre director Peter Brook, many theatre directors went after Asian traditional theatre art forms and other Asian representational systems, in order to develop and portray their own theatre presentations using, or somehow capitalizing on the actor training systems and scenic representations belonging to those particular Asian theatres, such as the Noh theatre, Kathakali, Chinese opera etcetera. While Peter Brook was successful in his approach to a universally accepted vision of theatre-making through the Asian theatre systems --beyond the parameters of imitating different theatrical topics-- many other younger institutions or directorial approaches are kept within the parameters of imitations or comparisons, or only exchanges of physical exercises.

===Adaptive theatre===
There are two types of intercultural theatre within adapted theatre. One can consider "the norm" to represent what the audience of a certain culture expects/has typically been exposed to:

* '''Adapts to the norm''' - traditional style productions that have been consciously adapted to fit with the cultural expectations of the intended audience of another culture.
* '''Adapts away from the norm''' - the original culture dominates but it borrows foreign elements to enlarge the range of expression (e.g. [[TheatreWorks (Singapore)]] and [[Ong Keng Sen]]; [[International Centre for Theatre Research]] and [[Peter Brook]]; and [[The Bridge - Stage of the Arts#Betty Comden's article about the festival|The Bridge - Stage of the Arts]])

===Universal theatre===
The aim of universal theatre is to be recognized and accepted by audience members from a wide range of cultural backgrounds (e.g. [[Peter Brook#The Mahabharata|The Mahabharata, Peter Brook]], [http://www.performingarts.jp/e/data_art/other/p-10481.html Hiroshi Koike] [http://kikh.com/ Bridge Project- The Mahabharata],&lt;ref&gt;[http://pappa-tara.com "Performing Arts Institute"]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://barihochwald.com/ Bari Hochwald] [http://theglobaltheatreproject.org/ The Global Theatre Project],&lt;ref&gt;[http://theglobaltheatreproject.org "The Global Theatre Project"]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.tfana.org/education/programs/world-theatre The World Theatre Project], [http://www.peoplestheatreproject.org/ People's Theatre Project] etc.)

==The sub-divisions of intercultural theatre==
Globalization supported in the developments of intercultural theatre in various directions and evolutions of point of views by the theatre practitioners, scholars, funders and producers(British Council, Fulbright, Ford foundation, [http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/Rockefeller-Foundation-Awards-1128 The Rockefeller foundation]) particularly using English language as the main medium of communication for knowing, acknowledging, debating, reasoning, considering, teaching, learning, writing, speaking, adapting, translating or transforming the one culture to the other culture in large contexts and in detailed micro contexts. Primarily the discourses of intercultural theatre practice developed out of the re-source influences of western theatre arts, western theoreticians and western theatre practitioners. (e.g. [http://www.odinteatret.dk/about-us/eugenio-barba.aspx%20 Eugenio Barba], [[Jerzy Grotowski]], [http://www.theworkcenter.org/ Thomas Richards], [[Peter Brook]], [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]],[http://www.phillipzarrilli.com/ Phillip Zarilli])

===American intercultural theatre===
*For many theatre cultures, American intercultural theatre has given the possibilities of new exchanges, experiments, researches and pioneer introductions of model attempts in theatre making. There are many directors, teachers or theatre artists began working with the sources of American point of views in the intercultural attempts and some of them are [http://rasaboxes.org/about/eca-biographies/ Richard Schechner], [http://www.phillipzarrilli.com/ Phillip Zarilli], Robert Wilson,Christian DuComb Phd, Prof.Esther Kim Lee, Ellen Stewart-La MaMa, Lee Breuer-Mabou Mines, Hugh Gittens, Anne Bogart, Phillip Glass etc.

===Australian intercultural theatre===

===British intercultural theatre===

===Canadian intercultural theatre===

==Non-Native English language speaking countries intercultural theatre==
*English is the primary medium of communication in the intercultural theatre scene worldwide and American English or British English used as the mother source language to make all transactions related with theatre training, teaching and performing. Many non English countries have welcomed the English language as the official medium for the citizens and thus opened possibilities of any business. The culture is also part of business in the sense of in-coming and out-going, travelling or transforming stories, experiences, music, histories and philosophies. The dramatic theories and the acting coaching is mainly developed by the American or European masters of contemporary theatre. The non native English language speaking cultures supported the new experiences, exchanges, experiments to present the new shows.

In 2015, JIVE became a [[European Research Infrastructure Consortium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = ERIC decision for JIVE | publisher = JIVE | date = 2014-12-11 | url = http://www.jive.eu/eric-decision-jive | accessdate = 2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very Long Baseline Interferometry ([[VLBI]]) is a type of [[astronomical interferometry]] used in [[radio astronomy]]. It allows observations of an object that are made simultaneously by many telescopes to be combined, emulating a telescope with a size equal to the maximum separation between the telescopes.

Normally the participating radio telescopes function individually, working on their own specific projects. In the case of VLBI, they all observe the same source at the same time, allowing much higher spatial resolution. There are many complex and challenging hurdles that need to be overcome to enable this effort. One challenge is the data processing requirement. JIVE operates the "EVN Data Processor" - a special-purpose [[supercomputer]] for [[astronomical]] [[VLBI]] data correlation. In a recent demonstration of JIVE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = European VLBI Network to participate in "100 Hours of Astronomy" with live webcast and e-VLBI observations | publisher = JIVE | date = 2009-03-16 | url = http://www.jive.nl/press_release_EVN_100Hrs.html | accessdate = 2009-07-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090719182456/http://www.jive.nl/press_release_EVN_100Hrs.html | archivedate = 2009-07-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 14 telescopes from in Australia, Chile, China, Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, [[Puerto Rico]], Spain, Sweden and the UK participated in joint observations of the active galaxy 3C120. The participating telescopes included:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Verkouter | first = Harro | title = April 3 and 5th 2009 | url = http://iya.expres-eu.org/index.html | accessdate = 2009-07-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20090712044638/http://iya.expres-eu.org/index.html | archivedate = 2009-07-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the 300m dish of [[Arecibo]], located in [[Puerto Rico]];
* the 6m dish of TIGO, operated by the Geodätisches Observatorium Wettzell.

The observations of the European VLBI Network are now carried out in real-time, thus earning the name of e-VLBI, or real-time, electronic Very Long Baseline Interferometry. The telescopes are then linked via high-speed [[national research and education networks]] (NRENs) which overcome some of the performance drawbacks of [[TCP/IP]] and [[UDP/IP]] (networking protocols) to allow sharing large volumes of data for immediate use. Such high-speed networks eliminate the shipping of disks of data from separate observations for correlation, thus allowing astronomers to respond to events as they happen in real time. The [[VLBI]] data are streamed to the JIVE, where they are correlated and the final, high-resolution image created.

JIVE is funded by the following national research councils and national facilities.
* [[Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research]] (NWO)
* [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] (STFC)
* National Institute for Astrophysics ([[INAF]])
* National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([[National Astronomical Observatory of China|NAOC]])

== History ==
''Boys' and Girls' Bureau of the Eastern States League'' was founded in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], in 1919 to help educate young people moving from rural America to the country's booming cities about the means of production and free enterprise. The following year, the organization's name was changed to the Junior Achievement Bureau. The name was modified in 1926 to Junior Achievement, Inc.&lt;ref name=IU&gt;{{cite web|title=Junior Achievement Records, 1916-2002, Ruth Lilly Special Collections &amp; Archives|url=http://www.ulib.iupui.edu/special/collections/philanthropy/mss048|publisher=Indiana University|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following World War II, the organization grew from a regional into a national organization.&lt;ref name=francomano&gt;{{cite book|last=Francomano|first=Joe|title=Junior Achievement: A History|year=1988|publisher=Junior Achievement Inc.|location=Colorado Springs, CO|pages=|url=https://www.jaworldwide.org/aboutja/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, JA began its growth into an international organization.&lt;ref name=francomano/&gt;

For more than 50 years, the organization was known mostly for the JA Company Program, an after-school program through which students form companies, sell stocks, produce and market a product, and sell it in their communities and globally. The student companies are mentored by volunteer advisers from the business and tech communities. In 1975, Junior Achievement introduced its first in-school program, Project Business, featuring volunteers from the local business community teaching middle school students about business and personal finance.&lt;ref name=francomano/&gt;

Today, JA Worldwide is one of the world's largest organization youth-serving organizations, dedicated to giving young people the knowledge and skills they need for employment and entrepreneurship. JA programs are delivered by corporate and community volunteers and provide relevant, hands-on experiences that give students knowledge and skills in financial literacy, work readiness, and entrepreneurship. JA annually reaches more than 10 million students in more than 100 countries around the world. Programs are delivered by more than 450,000 JA volunteers.&lt;ref name="JA Worldwide18"&gt;{{cite web|title=JA Worldwide Locations|url=https://www.jaworldwide.org/locations/

== National Conference ==

Beginning in 1944, Junior Achievement organized an annual national conference, known as the National Junior Achievers Conference, NAJAC, to bring together student representatives of local programs to participate in contests. In 1949, the organization began allowing conference delegates to elect national leadership to play an active role contributing to program development, increasing public awareness and supporting fundraising.&lt;ref name=IU/&gt;

From 1944 to 1961, conferences were held in New Jersey, West Virginia, Ohio and Indiana, before finding a permanent home on the campus of [[Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana]], where delegates have gathered in August of each year since 1962.&lt;ref name=IU/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10370">[[Guatemala]] is one of the richest [[biodiversity hotspots]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Tolisano J, López MM 2010 - Guatemala Biodiversity and Tropical Forest Assessment. United States Agency for International Development. Washington, DC, USA [http://www.usaid.gov/locations/latin_america_caribbean/environment/docs/section_118/Guate_FY2010.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the variety of its territory and ecosystems that occur from sea level up to more than 4,000 meters above sea level. [[Ecological niche]]s include (but are not limited to) subtropical and tropical [[rain forests]], [[wetlands]], [[dry forests]], scrublands, [[cloud forests]], pine-fir forests in the highlands. Despite this wealth, however, our knowledge on the mycobiota of the country is very poor.&lt;ref&gt;Comandini O, Erős–Honti Z, Jakucs E, Flores Arzú R, Leonardi M, Rinaldi AC 2012 – Molecular and morpho–anatomical description of mycorrhizas of ''Lactarius rimosellus'' on ''Quercus'' sp., with ethnomycological notes on ''Lactarius'' in Guatemala. Mycorrhiza 22: 279-287 [http://www.springerlink.com/content/85332238447hn748/]&lt;/ref&gt; There are several reasons for this, primarily the prolonged [[Guatemalan civil war]] (1960–1996) and related political and social instability that have severely hampered field work in the country. The lack of trained local mycologists has certainly also delayed the detailed investigation of the rich mycota inhabiting the [[Guatemala Biodiversity|highly diversified]] Guatemalan [[biotopes]].

==Diversity of Guatemala macrofungi==

Larger fungi (usually referred to as [[macrofungi]] or macromycetes) are of particular interest because of their importance as food resources and as a component of traditional culture in many places in the world.&lt;ref name=Boa&gt;Boa E 2004 - Wild edible fungi. A global overview of their use and importance to people. FAO. Rome, Italy [http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5489e/y5489e00.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, many [[basidiomycetes]] and [[ascomycetes]] with conspicuous [[Sporocarp (fungi)|sporocarps]] often play an important role as [[ectomycorrhizal]] mycobionts of trees and shrubs of boreal forests in the northern hemisphere and are important elements in many areas of the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Rinaldi AC, Comandini O, Kuyper TW 2008 - Ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity: separating the wheat from the chaff. Fungal Diversity 33: 1–45 [http://www.fungaldiversity.org/fdp/sfdp/33-1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Guatemalan macrofungi have not been as yet extensively surveyed, a preliminary checklist encompasses some 350 species of macromycetes (31 ascomycetes and 319 basidiomycetes) occurring in 163 genera and 20 ascomycetous and basidiomycetous orders.&lt;ref name=Flores&gt;Flores Arzú R, Comandini O, Rinaldi AC 2012 - A preliminary checklist of macrofungi of Guatemala, with notes on edibility ad traditional knowledge. Mycosphere 3: 1-21 [http://www.mycosphere.org/pdfs/MC3_1_No1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, 12 species of Ascomicetes where cited, with the new records, there are now 44 ascomycete species known from Guatemala &lt;ref&gt; Medel R., Morales, O., Castillo R, Cáceres R. 2013 - New ascomycete records from Guatemala. Mycotaxon 124:73-85. &lt;/ref&gt;Most available observations pertain to the highlands, in the departments of [[Alta Verapaz]], [[Baja Verapaz]], [[Chimaltenango]], [[Guatemala Department|Guatemala]], [[El Quiché]], [[Huehuetenango]], and [[Quetzaltenango]], while the wide lowland [[Petén Basin|Petén]] region has been scantly explored, despite the fact that it accounts for about one third of Guatemala's area and, together with adjacent areas of [[Belize]] and southern [[Mexico]], comprise the largest unbroken tract of tropical forest north of the [[Brazilian Amazon]]. At the order level, ''[[Agaricales]]'' was found to host the larger number of species (almost one third of the entire set), followed by ''[[Polyporales]]'' and ''[[Boletales]]''. The most represented genera are ''[[Amanita]]'', ''[[Russula]]'', ''[[Lactarius]]'', ''[[Laccaria]]'', ''[[Suillus]]''.&lt;ref name=Flores/&gt; Intriguingly, all these genera are ectomycorrhizal with the several ''[[Pinus]]'' and ''[[Quercus]]'' species that form extensive pine and mixed forests of the highlands, and/or with the endangered ''[[Abies guatemalensis]]'' (pinabete), most abundant between 2800–3200 m elevation on the [[Sierra de los Cuchumatanes]] in western Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;Vivero JL, Szejner M, Gordon J, Magin V 2006 - The red list of trees of Guatemala.

==Traditional knowledge and use==

“The Mesoamerican tradition of eating wild edible fungi continues from Mexico to west Guatemala then is absent from much of [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]], even though both contain forest areas that in theory support production of edible fungi,” remarked Eric Boa in his reference volume on worldwide wild edible fungi.&lt;ref name=Boa/&gt;

[[File:Hongos en mercado San Juan Sacatepéquez.jpg|thumb|A 'medida' of mixed edible mushrooms on sale in the San Juan Sacatepéquez market]]

Indeed, the deep mycophily of Guatemalan indigenous people is apparent. [[Ethnomycology|Ethnomycological]] surveys conducted in the highlands, mainly through visits to local markets and interviews with vendors, revealed that some 130 species were identified as edible species, most of which actually sold in markets or along roadsides.&lt;ref name=Flores/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sommerkamp Y 1990 - Hongos comestibles en los mercados de Guatemala. Dirección General de Investigación-DIGI. Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala. Guatemala City, Guatemala &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bran MC, Morales O, Cáceres R, Flores R 2003 – Contribución al conocimiento de los hongos comestibles de Guatemala. IIQB–USAC. Revista Científica, special issue [http://mushroom.uark.edu/publications/moralesetal2003.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Species of edible mushrooms belonging to different genera (e.g., ''Amanita'', ''Lactarius'', ''[[Helvella]]'') are often offered mixed together, and sold in form of ‘medida’, i.e. a fixed amount, which equals the content of a small basket. However, the more popular and valuable species are usually sold separately. ''[[Lactarius deliciosus]]'' and [[Lactarius indigo|''L. indigo'']] – known as ‘Shara’ (or ‘Xara’) ‘amarilla’ and ‘Shara’ (or ‘Xara’) ‘azul’, respectively, or ‘Cabeza de Xara’ in local Spanish (Sharas, also known as ‘urracas’, are birds, variously coloured, living in different parts of the country) – ''[[Amanita caesarea]]'' complex (hongo de San Juan), and ''[[Cantharellus cibarius]]'' (anacate), are among the most appreciated [[edible mushrooms]] among Guatemalan [[Maya people]]. ''Daldinia fissa'' is recorded as a common edible ascomycete from the municipality of Tecpán, Department of Chimaltenango. The mushroom is named as “tzan tz’i” in Kaqchikel dialect, that means “dog nose ” or “chucho nose” because of ascostroma shape. &lt;ref&gt;Morales O, Medel R, Guzmán G 2006 -Primer registro de la comestibilidad de una especie de ''Daldinia'' (Ascomycota). Revista Mexicana de Micología 23: 103-105.&lt;/ref&gt; Many, but by no means all, edible species are identified through common vernacular names that have been sometimes recorded in several [[Maya languages]].&lt;ref name=Flores/&gt; Generally, mushrooms are gathered and sold by women, often in family groups spanning three generations. Localities with more traditional knowledge, based on the number of
species are used, were Tecpán (Chimaltenango) with 31 species, followed by San Juan Comalapa (Chimaltenango)and Totonicapán city (Totonicapán), with 22 species each. The collection of wild edible fungi is done throughout the year and the main forms used for marketing were the "medida", "unidad", "Libra" and "manojo", being subject to their species or group of species in question use. &lt;ref&gt;Morales O, Bran M, Cáceres R 2010 -Los hongos comestibles de uso tradicional en Guatemala. Pp 437-464. En: Martínez-Carrera D, Curvetto N, Sobal M, Morales P, Mora V (Eds.). Hacia un Desarrollo Sostenible del Sistema de Producción-Consumo de los Hongos Comestibles y Medicinales en Latinoamérica: Avances y Perspectivas en el Siglo XXI. Red Latinoamericana de Hongos Comestibles y Medicinales-COLPOS-UNSCONACYT-AMC-UAEM-UPAEP-IMINAP, Puebla, México. &lt;/ref&gt; The use of macrofungi in Guatemala other than for human consumption is limited to a few instances, such as for wound healing and for preventing infections (spores and dried mycelia of ''[[Calvatia]]'' ''lilacina'' and ''C. cyathiformis''), cicatrizing substances to treat burns in children (sporocarps of ''[[Geastrum]]'' and ''[[Lycoperdon]]''), to heal and disinfect wounds and to treat bee stings (dried specimens of ''Lycoperdon marginatum'').&lt;ref name=Flores/&gt;

==IWEMM-7 in Guatemala==

Guatemala hosted the 7th International Workshop on Edible Ectomycorrhizal Mushrooms (IWEMM-7). Held in the beautiful colonial city of Antigua, from July 29 to August 3, 2013, the congress convened researchers from worldwide institutions to discuss the most recent information about diversity, cultivation and production of wild edible mycorrhizal mushrooms. Several talks also dealt with the current status of knowledge on macrofungi in Guatemala and their traditional use.

'''Manchester Digital Music Archive (MDMarchive)''' is an online community archive founded in 2003 by Matthew Norman, Alison Surtees, [https://about.me/abigail_ward Abigail Ward], [[CP Lee]] and Dave Rofe. It was created as a way of celebrating and raising awareness of Greater Manchester's musical heritage and protecting collections of material held by individuals and institutions relating to the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdmarchive.co.uk/about_us.php|title=Manchester District Music Archive: Mission Statement|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of 2015 it became a registered charity.

== Beginnings ==
The archive, originally named Manchester District Music Archive, came about in 2003 after Surtees and Norman had the idea of making a documentary about the Greater Manchester music scene, loosely based on [[CP Lee]]’s book ‘Shake, Rattle and Rain’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Unconvention: Alison Surtees | url= http://unconventionhub.org/alison-surtees | accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realising the subject was too vast to be contained within a documentary, Surtees and Norman, alongside Dave Rofe and CP Lee, decided to launch a campaign to create a Greater Manchester music museum. Abigail Ward joined the team shortly afterwards and began to develop an online presence for the project. Lee's book covered the history of Manchester music from 1955 - 1995 and contained an extensive band list at the end of the book, which was used a starting point when populating the band list on the Manchester Digital Music Archive website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CerysmaticFactory: Shake Rattle and Rain: Popular Music Making in Manchester 1955 - 1995 by CP Lee | url=http://www.cerysmaticfactory.info/shake_rattle_and_rain.php | accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A seminar was held at [[Urbis]] in 2004 to officially launch the newly constituted organisation with a panel featuring [[Jon Savage]], [[CP Lee]], [[Guy Garvey]], [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]] and Jan Hargreaves. Hundreds attended the event and it was announced that the intention was to set up a museum where people could donate items of music ephemera to the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=21 September 2004 | title=CerysmaticFactory: Manchester District Music Archive Seminar | url= http://www.cerysmaticfactory.info/mdma_seminar_210904.php | accessdate= 4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The co-founders then spent a number of years trying to create a physical space for the archive but after years of struggling to find something suitable, a website was set up in 2006, which allowed users to upload images of their own personal artefacts, along with associated memories, relating to Greater Manchester music, musicians, DJs and venues. This online archive was developed by Abigail Ward with web designer Ashley Kennerley (Go Bang! Design).

In 2007 and 2014, Manchester Digital Music Archive won the Big Chip best not-for-profit project award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MDMA {{!}} The Big Chip Awards|url = http://bigchipawards.com/MDMA2007|website = bigchipawards.com|access-date = 2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Best Not for Profit Project {{!}} The Big Chip Awards|url = http://bigchipawards.com/BNFPP2014|website = bigchipawards.com|access-date = 2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2015 the site has in excess of 3000 members who have uploaded material relating to more than 3350 bands, 600 DJs and 1000 venues. Users are encouraged to provide memories and anecdotes along with their artefacts and the only stipulation is that items need to be linked to acts or venues from Greater Manchester. All genres of music are covered and as well as an extensive collection of pop memorabilia, the archive includes material relating to the history of the [[Royal Northern College of Music]] and the [[The Hallé|Halle Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Manchester District Music Archive Homepage | url= http://www.mdmarchive.co.uk/ | accessdate= 4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can comment on and discuss items uploaded by others or curate online themed exhibitions using material from the site. The site has a number of these exhibitions on various subjects including [[Moss Side]] and [[Hulme]] club culture, [[City Fun]] fanzine, Manchester's [[LGBT]] music and club culture and [[Royal Northern College of Music]] students who served in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Manchester District Music Archive: Exhibitions | url=http://www.mdmarchive.co.uk/exhibitions.php | accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charitable status ==
In November 2015, the organisation became a registered charity and in June 2017 changed its name to Manchester Digital Music Archive. The board of trustees are Dave Carter, CP Lee, Cathy Brooks, Aidan O'Rourke and Sarah Feinstein.

== Physical Presence ==
The archive exists online but has held numerous events and exhibitions at venues around Greater Manchester. In 2008 it held an event at [[Islington Mill]] which explored the city’s 1980s electro-funk scene, curated by DJ [[Greg Wilson (DJ)|Greg Wilson]]. The event included music and discussion and also showed the premiere of the Tim Forde documentary 'Birth of The British B-Boy', which tells the story of breakdancing in Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Electrofunkroots: Electrospective Press Release | url= http://www.electrofunkroots.co.uk/electrospective-event-press-release | accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, following investment from [[Heritage Lottery Fund]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hlf.org.uk/|title=Heritage Lottery Fund|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; MDMarchive held an exhibition, ''Defining Me: Musical Adventures in Manchester'' ,at The Lowry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Lowry: What’s On – Defining Me: Musical Adventures In Manchester | url= http://www.thelowry.com/event/defining-me-musical-adventures-in-manchester | accessdate = 4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 5-month show co-curated by members of MDMarchive's online community. The exhibition attracted a 32,000 visitors. There were a number of spin-off events featuring Greater Manchester music luminaries in conversation, including [[Barry Adamson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Barry Adamson  - onstage interview &amp; audience Q&amp;A|url = http://www.manchesterhistoriesfestival.org.uk/whatson/barryadamson|website = Manchester Histories|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Cummins (photographer)|Kevin Cummins]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Seven of Kraak Gallery’s best events|url = http://www.timeout.com/manchester/blog/seven-of-kraak-gallerys-best-events-081715|website = Time Out Manchester|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Boon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ever fallen in love with Richard Boon?|url = http://www.northernsoul.me.uk/ever-fallen-in-love-with-richard-boon/|website = Northern Soul|access-date = 2016-01-12|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the project ended with a community concert at [[Band on the Wall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Musical Adventures in Manchester'- featuring The Prospectors with Graham Massey &lt; Events {{!}} Band on the Wall|url = http://bandonthewall.org/events/4292/|website = bandonthewall.org|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring British rave pioneer [[Graham Massey]] in collaboration with The Prospectors, a collective of disabled musicians from [[Stockport]].

The archive also has a regular presence in the ''Louder Than Words'' festival - an annual event focused on literature within the music industry. In 2014 MDMarchive hosted a panel discussion which saw Elbow's Guy Garvey, Jaheda Choudhury-Potter of Ajah UK and [[Everything Everything]]'s Jon Higgs talk about Greater Manchester lyricism in music .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=EnglandEvents.co.uk: Manchester: Hear my voice in your head and think of me kindly | url=http://englandevents.co.uk/manchester-hear-my-voice-in-your-head-and-think-of-me-kindly/35912 | accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year it hosted another session, this time focusing on the work of virtual archives and included panellists from MDMarchive as well as writer [[Anita Sethi]] and Jez Collins from the Birmingham Music Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Louder Than Words: Festival Programme 2015 | url=http://louderthanwordsfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Louder-Than-Words-Events1.pdf | accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Manchester Digital Music Archive won further investment from Heritage Lottery Fund for ''Rebel Music: The Sound of Politics and Protest in Manchester''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hlf.org.uk/our-projects/rebel-music-sound-politics-and-protest-manchester|title=Rebel Music: The Sound of Politics and Protest in Manchester {{!}} Heritage Lottery Fund|website=www.hlf.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mdmarchive.co.uk/news.php?id=209|title=MDMarchive wins Heritage Lottery support for Rebel Music project : MANCHESTER DIGITAL MUSIC ARCHIVE|website=MANCHESTER DIGITAL MUSIC ARCHIVE|language=en|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;'','' a project exploring the intertwined histories of music and political activism across the ten boroughs of the Greater Manchester. The project will focus in particular on the musical achievements of women and the LGBT+ community.

Throughout the project, MDMarchive will be working with teams of volunteers from the two chosen communities (women and LGBT+ people) to co-produce a programme of events, two physical pop-up exhibitions, a series of digital exhibitions, six short films and three guided heritage walks. The volunteers will also access training on how to preserve and share their own musical heritage.

The first physical exhibition, ''Queer Noise: The History of LGBT+ Music &amp; Club Culture in Manchester'', will be held at the [[People's History Museum|People’s History Museum]] from July–September 2017 as part of ''Never Going Underground 2017'', a major exhibition marking 50 years since the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality. The second exhibition, ''Woman: Breaking The Rules'' is slated for February 2018 and will coincide with 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage.

'''Manfred Rühl''' (born 1933, [[Nürnberg]]) is a German professor emeritus for [[communications]] at the [[University of Bamberg]], a leading communication theorist,&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Rühl (2008):  Kommunikationskulturen der Weltgesellschaft. Theorie der Kommunikationswissenschaft. Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften Wiesbaden, {{ISBN|978-3-531-14063-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; an original and productive researcher in [[journalism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Journalismustheorie]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[public relations]].&lt;ref&gt;Franz Ronneberger &amp; Manfred Rühl (1992): Theorie der Public Relations. Ein Entwurf. Westdeutscher Verlag Opladen, {{ISBN|3-531-12118-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

From 1956 onwards he studied [[economics]], communications, [[sociology]], [[political science]], and [[philosophy]] at the [[University]] of [[Erlangen]], [[Free University of Berlin]], and [[Nürnberg]] [[College]] of [[Economics]] and [[Social Sciences]]. In 1960, he graduated with a diploma in economics at the [[Nürnberg]] [[College]] of [[Economics]] and [[Social Sciences]]. In 1968, he received a doctorate in [[social sciences]], and in 1978, he qualified with a [[habilitation]] for communications, both at the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]]

In 1964, Rühl started to work as an Assistant Professor at the [[Institute]] for [[Political]] and [[Communication Sciences]] of the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]]. From 1969 to 1970, with a postgraduate fellowship, he was Scholar in Residence at the  [[University of Pennsylvania]] [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania|Annenberg School for Communication]]. He is or was Research Professor at the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]] (1971-1976), Associate Professor at the [[University of Hohenheim]] (1976-1983), and Full Professor at the [[University of Bamberg]] (since 1983), also frequently a visiting professor at the [[universities]] of [[Mainz]] and [[Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;* CV Manfred Rühl (http://www.uni-bamberg.de/kowi/personen-einrichtungen/manfred-ruehl-emeritus/)&lt;/ref&gt;

A founding member in 1963, Rühl served as President of the [[DGPuK - Deutsche Gesellschaft für Publizistik- und Kommunikationswissenschaft]] (1980-1982),&lt;ref&gt;*http://www.dgpuk.de/&lt;/ref&gt; and as a Member-at-Large at the Board of Directors, ICA - [[International Communication Association]] (1977-1980).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icahdq.org/&lt;/ref&gt; He reviewed for many institutions and journals from DFG - [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]], [[AvH]] - [[Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung]], DAAD - [[Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst]], [[SNSF]] - [[Swiss National Science Foundation]] to [[Publizistik]], [[Medien &amp; Kommunikationswissenschaft]], [[Journalism Quarterly]], and [[Journal of Communication]].&lt;ref&gt;* CV Manfred Rühl (http://www.uni-bamberg.de/kowi/personen-einrichtungen/manfred-ruehl-emeritus/)&lt;/ref&gt;

Manfred Rühl's research interests span [[systems theory]], [[comparative]] [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]], [[communication theory]], communication policy, public communication, [[journalism]], [[public relations]], [[organizational communication]], and [[Market (economics)|market]] communication. [[Communication systems]] have become one of the most popular, "non-normative" and "non-linear" theoretical models in contemporary communications.&lt;ref&gt;Betteke van Ruler, Ana Tkalac Verčič and Dejan Verčič, eds. (2008): Public relations metrics: Research and evaluation. New York, London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Rühl's work marked a radical change in perspective, when he conducted since the 1960s [[empirical]] studies of [[journalism]] that focused on an organized social system instead of journalistic individuals, based on [[communication]] instead of action or behavior, but on communication as a reality that occurs within differing systems and environments. Within his reference theoretical framework, public]] [[communication]] is studied as applied [[organizational communication]], market communication, and [[societal]] [[communication]] as journalism, public relations, and other systems of persuasion and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]]. In the course of recent decades, many scholars, particularly in the German speaking countries adapted his approaches and developed them further.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Löffelholz and David Weaver (2008): Global Journalism Research.

}}'''Mark Antony Wigley''' is a [[New Zealand]]-born architect, author, and (from 2004 to 2014) Dean of [[Columbia University|Columbia University's]] [[Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation]], [[New York City]], [[United States]].

==Career==
Wigley received both his Bachelor of Architecture (1979) and Ph.D. (1987) from the [[University of Auckland]], New Zealand. Mike Austin was his doctoral supervisor.  Wigley left [[Auckland]] in 1986 and taught at [[Princeton University]], from 1987 to 1999, serving also as the director of Graduate Studies at Princeton’s School of Architecture.

In 1988, Wigley co-curated with [[Philip Johnson]] the [[MoMA]] exhibition ''Deconstructivist Architecture''. The exhibition featured the works of seven architects, who were already well-known at the time for a style of architecture that involved in various ways "deconstructing" conventional notions of architectural convention: [[Frank Gehry]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Bernard Tschumi]], [[Rem Koolhaas]] and [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]]. The curators linked the works to the philosophical notion of [[Deconstruction]], as espoused by French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]], as well as the art-architectural historical precedent of [[Russian constructivism]], and several works from this period were displayed in the exhibition. However, of the architects only Eisenman and Tschumi acknowledged the connection to Derrida and only Hadid and Koolhaas to Constructivism.

== Personal life ==
Mark Wigley is married to architectural historian [[Beatriz Colomina]].

==Volume Magazine==
In 2005, Wigley founded [[Volume Magazine]] together with [[Rem Koolhaas]] and [[Ole Bouman]]. A collaborative project by Archis (Amsterdam), [[Wharenui|AMO]] Rotterdam and C-lab ([[Columbia University]] NY), [[Volume Magazine]] is an experimental [[think tank]] focusing on the process of spatial and cultural [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]]. The magazine aims to explore "beyond architecture’s definition of 'making buildings'" by presenting global views on architecture and design, broader attitudes to social structures and created environments; and embodies progressive journalism.

Created and founded in collaboration with Brett Steele the Institute of Failure; essentially an academic institution for the instruction and theory of failure (as opposed to success).

==Awards==
Wigley was awarded the Resident Fellowship, [[Chicago]] Institute for Architecture and Urbanism, 1989; [[International Committee of Architectural Critics]] (C.I.C.A.) Triennial Award for Architectural Criticism, 1990; and the Graham Foundation Grant, 1997.

Two classifications of microplastics currently exist. Primary microplastics are any plastic fragments or particles that are already 5.0 mm in size or less before entering the environment. These include [[microfibers]] from clothing, [[microbeads]], and plastic pellets (also known as nurdles).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=Matthew|last2=Lindeque|first2=Pennie|last3=Fileman|first3=Elaine|last4=Halsband|first4=Claudia|last5=Goodhead|first5=Rhys|last6=Moger|first6=Julian|last7=Galloway|first7=Tamara S.|date=2013-06-06|title=Microplastic Ingestion by Zooplankton|url=|journal=[[Environmental Science &amp; Technology]]|volume=47|issue=12|pages=6646–6655|doi=10.1021/es400663f|pmid=23692270|via=|hdl=10871/19651}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marinelitterthefacts.com/sources|title=Where Does Marine Litter Come From?|last=|first=|date=|website=Marine Litter Facts|publisher=British Plastics Federation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Boucher|first=Julien|last2=Friot|first2=Damien|date=2017|title=Primary Microplastics in the Oceans: a Global Evaluation of Sources|url=https://storyofstuff.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IUCN-report-Primary-microplastics-in-the-oceans.pdf|journal=[[IUCN]]|volume=|pages=|doi=10.2305/IUCN.CH.2017.01.en|isbn=978-2-8317-1827-9|via=}}{{pn|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary microplastics are microplastics that are created from the degradation of larger plastic products once they enter the environment through natural weathering processes.

[[File:Microplastic sample .jpg|thumb|Image of microplastic samples in a lab]]
Additionally, plastics degrade slowly, often over hundreds if not thousands of years. This increases the probability of microplastics being ingested and incorporated into, and [[bioaccumulation|accumulated]] in, the bodies and tissues of many organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Grossman |first=Elizabeth |date=2015-01-15 |title=How Plastics from Your Clothes Can End up in Your Fish |url=http://time.com/3669084/plastics-pollution-fish/ |magazine=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://4ocean.com/blogs/blog/how-long-does-it-take-trash-to-biodegrade|title=How Long Does it Take Trash to Decompose|first=|date=20 January 2017|work=4Ocean|access-date=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire cycle and movement of microplastics in the environment is not yet known, but research is currently underway to investigate this issue.

[[File:Mikroplastasarp.jpg|thumb|Polyethylene based microspherules in toothpaste]]Worsening matters, microplastics are common in our world today. In 2014, it was estimated that there are between 15 and 51 trillion individual pieces of microplastic in the world’s oceans, which was estimated to weigh between 93,000 and 236,000 metric tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/srep23501 |pmid=27000994 |pmc=4802224 |title=The degradation potential of PET bottles in the marine environment: An ATR-FTIR based approach |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=6 |pages=23501 |year=2016 |last1=Ioakeimidis |first1=C. |last2=Fotopoulou |first2=K.

==Classification==
===Primary microplastics===
Primary microplastics are small pieces of plastic that are purposefully manufactured&lt;ref name="KarbalaeiHWC" /&gt;. They are usually used in facial [[cleanser]]s and [[cosmetics]], or in [[Air blaster|air blasting]] technology. In some cases, their use in medicine as [[drug vector|vectors for drugs]] was reported.&lt;ref name="Patel,2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patel|first1=Mayur M.|last2=Goyal|first2=Bhoomika R.|last3=Bhadada|first3=Shraddha V.|last4=Bhatt|first4=Jay S.|last5=Amin|first5=Avani F.|date=January 2009|title=Getting into the Brain: Approaches to Enhance Brain Drug Delivery|url=|journal=[[CNS Drugs]]|volume=23|issue=1|pages=35–58|doi=10.2165/0023210-200923010-00003|pmid=19062774|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microplastic "scrubbers", used in [[exfoliating]] hand cleansers and facial scrubs, have replaced traditionally used natural ingredients, including ground [[Almond|almonds]], [[oatmeal]], and [[pumice]]. Primary microplastics have also been produced for use in air blasting technology. This process involves blasting [[acrylate polymer|acrylic]], [[melamine]], or [[polyester]] microplastic scrubbers at machinery, engines, and boat hulls to remove rust and paint. As these scrubbers are used repeatedly until they diminish in size and their cutting power is lost, they often become contaminated with [[heavy metal (chemical element)|heavy metals]] such as [[cadmium]], [[chromium]], and [[lead]].&lt;ref name="Cole Mathew,2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cole |first1=Matthew |last2=Lindeque |first2=Pennie |last3=Halsband |first3=Claudia |last4=Galloway |first4=Tamara S. |date=December 2011 |title=Microplastics as contaminants in the marine environment: A review |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=62 |issue=12 |pages=2588–2597 |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2011.09.025|pmid=22001295 |hdl=10871/19649 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many companies have committed to reducing the production of microbeads, there are still many bioplastic microbeads that also have a long degradation life cycle similar to normal plastic.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Secondary microplastics===
Secondary plastics are small pieces of plastic derived from the breakdown of larger plastic debris, both at sea and on land. Over time, a culmination of physical, biological, and chemphotodegradation, including photodegradation caused by sunlight exposure, can reduce the structural integrity of plastic debris to a size that is eventually undetectable to the naked eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masura|first=Julie|last2=Baker|first2=Joel|last3=Foster|first3=Gregory|last4=Arthur|first4=Courtney|date=July 2015|editor-last=Herring|editor-first=Carlie|title=Laboratory Methods for the Analysis of Microplastics in the Marine Environment: Recommendations for quantifying synthetic particles in waters and sediments|url=|journal=[[NOAA|NOAA Marine Debris Program]]|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process of breaking down large plastic material into much smaller pieces is known as fragmentation.&lt;ref name="Cole Mathew,2011" /&gt; It is considered that microplastics might further degrade to be smaller in size, although the smallest microplastic reportedly detected in the oceans at present is 1.6 micrometres (6.3×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; in) in diameter.[[Microplastics#cite%20note-Cole%20Mathew%2C2011-7|&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] The prevalence of microplastics with uneven shapes suggests that fragmentation is a key source.[[Microplastics#cite%20note-8|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

===Other sources: as a by-product/dust emission during wear and tear===
There are countless sources of both primary and secondary microplastics. Microplastic fibers enter the environment from the washing of synthetic clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/sources-effect-microplastics-humans-animals-environment.php |title=What are the Sources of Microplastics and its Effect on Humans and the Environment? - Conserve Energy Future |date=2018-05-19 |work=Conserve Energy Future |access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00267-017-0947-8 |pmid=29043380 |title=Are We Underestimating Microplastic Contamination in Aquatic Environments? |journal=Environmental Management |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=2018 |last1=Conkle |first1=Jeremy L. |last2=Báez Del Valle |first2=Christian D. |last3=Turner |first3=Jeffrey W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tires, composed partly of synthetic styrene butadiene rubber, will erode into tiny plastic and rubber particles as they are used. Furthermore, 2.0-5.0 mm plastic pellets, used to create other plastic products, often enter ecosystems due to spillages and other accidents.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A Norwegian Environment Agency review report about microplastics published in early 2015&lt;ref name="Sundt and Schulze 2014"&gt;Sundt, Peter and Schulze, Per-Erik: "Sources of microplastic-pollution to the marine environment", "Mepex for the Norwegian Environment Agency", 2015&lt;/ref&gt; states it would be beneficial to classify these sources as primary, as long as microplastics from these sources are added from human society at the "start of the pipe", and their emissions are inherently a result of human material and product use and not secondary defragmentation in nature.

The existence of microplastics in the environment is often established through aquatic studies. These include taking [[plankton]] samples, analyzing sandy and muddy [[sediment]]s, observing [[vertebrate]] and [[invertebrate]] consumption, and evaluating chemical [[pollutant]] interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ivar do Sul|first1=Juliana A.|last2=Costa|first2=Monica F.|date=February 2014|title=The present and future of microplastic pollution in the marine environment|url=|journal=[[Environmental Pollution (journal)|Environmental Pollution]]|volume=185|pages=352–364|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2013.10.036|pmid=24275078|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through such methods, it has been shown that there are microplastics from multiple sources in the environment.

Microplastics could contribute up to 30% of the [[Great Pacific garbage patch|Great Pacific Garbage Patch]] polluting the world’s oceans and, in many developed countries, are a bigger source of marine plastic pollution than the visible larger pieces of marine litter, according to a 2017 [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] report.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Sewage treatment plants ===
[[Sewage treatment]] plants, also known as wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), remove contaminants from wastewater, primarily from household sewage, using various physical, chemical, and biological processes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Most plants in developed countries have both [[Sewage treatment#Primary treatment|primary]] and [[secondary treatment]] stages. In the primary stage of treatment, physical processes are employed to remove oils, sand, and other large solids using conventional filters, [[clarifier]]s, and settling tanks.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite report |date=1997 |title=Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Treatment |url=https://www.epa.ie/pubs/advice/water/wastewater/EPA_water_%20treatment_manual_primary_secondary_tertiary1.pdf |series=Wastewater Treatment Manuals |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency, Ireland |location=Wexford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary treatment uses biological processes involving [[bacteria]] and [[protozoa]] to break down organic matter. Common secondary technologies are [[activated sludge]] systems, [[trickling filter]]s, and [[constructed wetland]]s. The optional tertiary treatment stage may include processes for nutrient removal ([[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]) and [[disinfection]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Microplastics have been detected in both the primary and secondary treatment stages of the plants. A study estimated that about one particle per liter of microplastics are being released back into the environment, with a removal efficiency of about 99.9%.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carr|first=Steve A.|last2=Liu|first2=Jin|last3=Tesoro|first3=Arnold G.|date=15 March 2016|title=Transport and fate of microplastic particles in wastewater treatment plants|url=|journal=[[Water Research]]|volume=91|pages=174–182|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2016.01.002|pmid=26795302|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Estahbanati|first=Shirin|last2=Fahrenfeld|first2=N.L.|date=November 2016|title=Influence of wastewater treatment plant discharges on microplastic concentrations in surface water|url=http://raritan.rutgers.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Estahbanati-Fahrenfeld-2016-Influence-of-wastewater-treatment-plant-discharges-on-microplastic-concentratison-in-surface-water.pdf|journal=[[Chemosphere (journal)|Chemosphere]]|volume=162|pages=277–284|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.07.083|pmid=27508863|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mintenig|first=S.M.|last2=Int-Veen|first2=I.|last3=Löder|first3=M.G.J.|last4=Primpke|first4=S.|last5=Gerdts|first5=G.|date=2017-01-01|title=Identification of microplastic in effluents of waste water treatment plants using focal plane array-based micro-Fourier-transform infrared imaging|url=|journal=[[Water Research]]|volume=108|pages=365–372|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2016.11.015|pmid=27838027|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study showed that most microplastics are actually removed during the primary treatment stage where solid skimming and sludge settling are used.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When these treatment facilities are functioning properly, the contribution of microplastics into oceans and surface water environments from WWTPs is not disproportionately large.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Fionn|last2=Ewins|first2=Ciaran|last3=Carbonnier|first3=Frederic|last4=Quinn|first4=Brian|date=2016-06-07|title=Wastewater Treatment Works (WwTW) as a Source of Microplastics in the Aquatic Environment|url=|journal=[[Environmental Science &amp; Technology]]|volume=50|issue=11|pages=5800–5808|doi=10.1021/acs.est.5b05416|pmid=27191224|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is important to note that in certain countries sewage sludge is used for soil fertilizer, which exposes plastics in the sludge to the weather, sunlight, and other biological factors, causing fragmentation. As a result, microplastics from these biosolids often end up in storm drains and eventually into bodies of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weithmann|first=Nicolas|last2=Möller|first2=Julia N.|last3=Löder|first3=Martin G. J.|last4=Piehl|first4=Sarah|last5=Laforsch|first5=Christian|last6=Freitag|first6=Ruth|date=2018-04-01|title=Organic fertilizer as a vehicle for the entry of microplastic into the environment|url=|journal=[[Science Advances]]|volume=4|issue=4|pages=eaap8060|doi=10.1126/sciadv.aap8060|pmc=5884690|pmid=29632891|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some studies show that microplastics do pass through filtration processes at some WWTPs (Microplastics as Contaminants, 2011). According to a study from the UK, samples taken from sewage sludge disposal sites on the coasts of six continents contained an average one particle of microplastic per liter. A significant amount of these particles was of clothing fibers from washing machine effluent.&lt;ref name="Browne2011" /&gt;

=== Car and truck tires ===
Wear and tear from tires significantly contributes to the flow of (micro-)plastics into the environment. Estimates of emissions of microplastics to the environment in [[Denmark]] are between [[orders of magnitude (mass)#106 to 1011 kg|{{convert|5,500|and|14,000|tonne}}]] per year. Secondary microplastics (e.g. from car and truck tires or footwear) are more important than primary microplastics by two orders of magnitude. The formation of microplastics from the degradation of larger plastics in the environment is not accounted for in the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2015 |title=Microplastics: Occurrence, effects and sources of releases to the environment in Denmark |url=http://www2.mst.dk/Udgiv/publications/2015/10/978-87-93352-80-3.pdf |publisher=Ministry of Environment and Food in Denmark, Danish Environmental Protection Agency |location=Copenhagen |id=Environmental project No. 1793 |page=14 |isbn=978-87-93352-80-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The estimated per capita emission ranges from 0.23 to 4.7 kg/year, with a global average of 0.81 kg/year. The emissions from car tires (100%) are substantially higher than those of other sources of microplastics, e.g., airplane tires (2%), artificial turf (12–50%), brake wear (8%), and road markings (5%). Emissions and pathways depend on local factors like road type or sewage systems. The relative contribution of tire wear and tear to the total global amount of plastics ending up in our oceans is estimated to be 5–10%. In air, 3–7% of the particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) is estimated to consist of tire wear and tear, indicating that it may contribute to the global health burden of air pollution which has been projected by the World Health Organization (WHO) at 3 million deaths in 2012. The wear and tear also enter our food chain, but further research is needed to assess human health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kole|first=Pieter Jan|last2=Löhr|first2=Ansje J.|last3=Van Belleghem|first3=Frank|last4=Ragas|first4=Ad|last5=Kole|first5=Pieter Jan|last6=Löhr|first6=Ansje J.|last7=Van Belleghem|first7=Frank G.

===Cosmetics industry===
Some companies have replaced natural [[exfoliating]] ingredients with microplastics, usually in the form of "[[microbead]]s" or "micro-exfoliates". These products are typically composed of [[polyethylene]], a common component of plastics, but they can also be manufactured from [[polypropylene]], [[polyethylene terephthalate]], and [[nylon]].&lt;ref name="BeattheMicrobead"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatthemicrobead.org/en/|title=International Campaign against Microbeads in Cosmetics|last=|first=|date=|website=Beat the Microbead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315021442/http://beatthemicrobead.org/en/|archive-date=15 March 2015|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often found in face washes, [[hand soap]]s, and other personal care products, so the beads are usually washed into the [[sewage]] system immediately after use. Their small size prevents them from fully being retained by preliminary treatment screens at wastewater plants, thereby allowing some to enter rivers and oceans.&lt;ref name="Fendall2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2009.04.025 |pmid=19481226 |title=Contributing to marine pollution by washing your face: Microplastics in facial cleansers |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=58 |issue=8 |pages=1225–1228 |year=2009 |last1=Fendall |first1=Lisa S. |last2=Sewell |first2=Mary A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, wastewater treatment plants only remove an average of 95–99.9% of microbeads because of their small design . This leaves an average of 0-7 microbeads per litre being discharged.&lt;ref name=pmid27836135&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.10.048 |pmid=27836135 |title=Microplastics in personal care products: Exploring perceptions of environmentalists, beauticians and students |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=113 |issue=1–2 |pages=454–460 |year=2016 |last1=Anderson |first1=A.G. |last2=Grose |first2=J. |last3=Pahl |first3=S. |last4=Thompson |first4=R.C. |last5=Wyles |first5=K.J. |url=http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/812629/1/Anderson%20et%20al%20%282016%29%20-%20MPB%20-%20microbeads%20%28accepted%20manuscript%29.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that one treatment plant discharges 160 trillion liters of water per day, around 8 trillion microbeads are released into waterways every day.&lt;ref name=pmid27836135/&gt; This averages out to around 8 trillion microbeads being released into waterways per day. This number doesn’t account for the sewage sludge that is reused as fertilizer after the waste water treatment that has been know to still contain these microbeads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/acs.est.5b03909 |pmid=26334581 |title=Scientific Evidence Supports a Ban on Microbeads |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=49 |issue=18 |pages=10759–10761 |year=2015 |last1=Rochman |first1=Chelsea M. |last2=Kross |first2=Sara M. |last3=Armstrong |first3=Jonathan B. |last4=Bogan |first4=Michael T. |last5=Darling |first5=Emily S. |last6=Green |first6=Stephanie J. |last7=Smyth |first7=Ashley R. |last8=Veríssimo |first8=Diogo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an issue at the household level because it has been estimated that around 808 trillion beads per household are discharged in a single day whether due to cosmetic exfoliates, face wash, toothpaste, or other sources. Although many companies have committed to phasing out the use of microbead in their products a research found that there are at least 80 different facial scrub products that are still being sold with microbeads as a main component.&lt;ref name=pmid27836135/&gt; This fact contributes to the total of 80 metric tons of microbead discharge per year just by the United Kingdom alone. This not only has a negative impact on the wildlife and food chain but also in terms of toxicity because plastics such as microbeads have been proven to absorb dangerous chemicals such as pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name=pmid27836135/&gt;

===Clothing===

However, these types of fibers contribute greatly to the persistence to microplastics in terrestrial, aerial, and marine ecosystems. The process of washing clothes causes garments to lose an average of over 100 fibers per liter of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es201811s |pmid=21894925 |title=Accumulation of Microplastic on Shorelines Woldwide: Sources and Sinks |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=45 |issue=21 |pages=9175–9179 |year=2011 |last1=Browne |first1=Mark Anthony |last2=Crump |first2=Phillip |last3=Niven |first3=Stewart J. |last4=Teuten |first4=Emma |last5=Tonkin |first5=Andrew |last6=Galloway |first6=Tamara |last7=Thompson |first7=Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been linked with health effects possibly caused by the release of monomers, dispersive dyes, mordants, and plasticisers from manufacturing. The commonality of these types of fibers in the common households has been shown to represent 33% of all fibers in indoor environments.&lt;ref name="Browne2011" /&gt;

Anthropomorphic fibers have been studied in both indoor and outdoor environments to study the concentration of these to see what the average human exposure to microfibers look like. The indoor concentration was 1.0–60.0 fibers/m^3 whereas the outdoor concentration was much lower at 0.3-1.5 fibers/m^3.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2016.12.013 |pmid=27989388 |title=A first overview of textile fibers, including microplastics, in indoor and outdoor environments |journal=Environmental Pollution |volume=221 |pages=453–458 |year=2017 |last1=Dris |first1=Rachid |last2=Gasperi |first2=Johnny |last3=Mirande |first3=Cécile |last4=Mandin |first4=Corinne |last5=Guerrouache |first5=Mohamed |last6=Langlois |first6=Valérie |last7=Tassin |first7=Bruno |url=https://hal-enpc.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01418927/file/dris2017.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deposition rate indoors was 1586-11,130 fibers per day/m^3 which accumulates to around 190-670 fibers/mg of dust.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The largest concern with these concentrations is that it increases exposure to children and the elderly which can cause adverse health effects.

===Manufacturing===
The manufacture of plastic products uses [[granular material|granules]] and small [[resin]] pellets as their raw material. In the United States, production increased from 2.9 million pellets in 1960 to 21.7 million pellets in 1987. Through accidental spillage during land or sea transport, inappropriate use as [[packing material]]s, and direct outflow from processing plants, these raw materials can enter [[aquatic ecosystem]]s. In an assessment of [[Sweden|Swedish]] waters using an 80&amp;nbsp;µm mesh, KIMO Sweden found typical microplastic concentrations of 150–2,400 microplastics per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; in a harbor adjacent to a plastic production facility, the concentration was 102,000 per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Cole Mathew,2011"/&gt;

Many industrial sites in which convenient raw plastics are frequently used are located near bodies of water. If spilled during production, these materials may leak into the surrounding environment, polluting waterways.&lt;ref name="Sundt and Schulze 2014" /&gt; “More recently, Operation Cleansweep (www.opcleansweep.org), a joint initiative of the American Chemistry Council and Society of the Plastics Industry, is aiming for industries to commit to zero pellet loss during their operations”.&lt;ref name="Cole Mathew,2011" /&gt; Overall, there is a significant lack of research conducted about specific industries and companies that contribute to microplastics pollution.

===Fishing industry===
[[Recreational fishing|Recreational]] and [[commercial fishing]], [[marine vessel]]s, and marine industries are all sources of plastic that can directly enter the marine environment, posing a risk to biota both as macroplastics, and as secondary microplastics following long-term degradation. [[Marine debris]] observed on beaches also arises from beaching of materials carried on inshore and ocean currents. [[Fishing gear]] is a form of plastic debris with a marine source. Discarded or lost fishing gear, including plastic monofilament line and nylon [[fishing net|netting]], is typically neutrally [[buoyant]] and can, therefore, drift at variable depths within the oceans. Various countries have reported that microplastics from the industry and other sources have been accumulating in different types of seafood. In [[Indonesia]], 55% of all fish species had evidence of manufactured debris similar to America which reported 67%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/srep14340 |pmid=26399762 |pmc=4585829 |title=Anthropogenic debris in seafood: Plastic debris and fibers from textiles in fish and bivalves sold for human consumption |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=5 |pages=14340 |year=2015 |last1=Rochman |first1=Chelsea M. |last2=Tahir |first2=Akbar |last3=Williams |first3=Susan L. |last4=Baxa |first4=Dolores V. |last5=Lam |first5=Rosalyn |last6=Miller |first6=Jeffrey T. |last7=Teh |first7=Foo-Ching |last8=Werorilangi |first8=Shinta |last9=Teh |first9=Swee J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of debris in Indonesia was plastic, while in North America the majority was synthetic fibers found in clothing and some types of nets. The implication that fish are being contaminated with microplastic is that those plastics and chemicals will bioaccumulate in the food chain.

One study analyzed the plastic-derived chemical called [[polybrominated diphenyl ethers]] (PBDEs) in the stomachs of [[short-tailed shearwater]]s. It found that one-fourth of the birds had higher-brominated congeners that are not naturally found in their prey. However, the PBDE got into the birds' systems through plastic that was found in the stomachs of the birds. It is therefore not just the plastics that are being transferred through the food chain but the chemicals from the plastics as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2012.12.010 |pmid=23298431 |title=Accumulation of plastic-derived chemicals in tissues of seabirds ingesting marine plastics |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=69 |issue=1–2 |pages=219–222 |year=2013 |last1=Tanaka |first1=Kosuke |last2=Takada |first2=Hideshige |last3=Yamashita |first3=Rei |last4=Mizukawa |first4=Kaoruko |last5=Fukuwaka |first5=Masa-aki |last6=Watanuki |first6=Yutaka }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Packaging and shipping===
[[Shipping]] has significantly contributed to marine pollution. Some statistics indicate that in 1970, commercial shipping fleets around the world dumped over 23,000 tons of plastic waste into the marine environment. In 1988, an international agreement ([[MARPOL 73/78]], Annex V) prohibited the dumping of waste from ships into the marine environment. However, shipping remains a dominant source of [[plastic pollution#Ocean|plastic pollution]], having contributed around 6.5 million tons of plastic in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Derraik2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0025-326X(02)00220-5 |title=The pollution of the marine environment by plastic debris: A review |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=44 |issue=9 |pages=842–852 |year=2002 |last1=Derraik |first1=José G.B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0284 |pmid=19528054 |pmc=2873017 |title=Transport and release of chemicals from plastics to the environment and to wildlife |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=364 |issue=1526 |pages=2027–2045 |year=2009 |last1=Teuten |first1=E.

This waste from the Chinese company [[Sinopec]] was reported to have piled up in large quantities on beaches.&lt;ref name="Sundt and Schulze 2014" /&gt; While this is a large incident of spillage, researchers speculate that smaller accidents also occur and further contribute to marine microplastic pollution.&lt;ref name="Sundt and Schulze 2014" /&gt; 

=== Plastic water bottles ===
In one study, 93% of the bottled water from 11 different brands showed microplastic contamination. Per liter, researchers found an average of 325 microplastic particles.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mason|first=Sherri, A.|last2=Welch|first2=Victoria|last3=Neratko|first3=Joseph|date=|title=Synthetic Polymer Contamination in Bottled Water|url=https://orbmedia.org/sites/default/files/FinalBottledWaterReport.pdf|journal=State University of New York at Fredonia|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the tested brands, Nestlé Pure Life and Gerolsteiner bottles contained the most microplastic with 930 and 807 microplastic particles per liter (MPP/L), respectively.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; San Pellegrino products showed the least quantity of microplastic densities. Compared to water from taps, water from plastic bottles contained twice as much microplastic. Some of the contamination likely comes from the process of bottling and packaging the water.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==Potential effects on the environment==
{{split section|Environmental impacts of microplastics|date=September 2016}}
Participants at the 2008 International Research Workshop on the Occurrence, Effects and Fate of Microplastic Marine Debris at the [[University of Washington]] at Tacoma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-last=Arthur |editor1-first=Courtney |editor2-last=Baker |editor2-first=Joel |editor3-last=Bamford |editor3-first=Holly |title=Proceedings of the Intenational Research Workshop on the Occurrence, Effects, and Fate of Microplastic Marine Debris, September 9-11, 2008 |journal=Technical Memorandum NOS-OR&amp;R-30 |date=2009 |pages=49 |url=https://marinedebris.noaa.gov/file/2192/download?token=5dvqb-YY |accessdate=2018-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that microplastics are a problem in the marine environment, based on:
*the documented occurrence of microplastics in the marine environment,
*the long residence times of these particles (and, therefore, their likely buildup in the future), and
*their demonstrated ingestion by [[marine organism]]s.

So far, research has mainly focused on larger plastic items. Widely-recognized problems facing marine life are entanglement, ingestion, [[suffocation]] and general debilitation often leading to death and/or strandings. This causes serious public concern. In contrast, microplastics are not as conspicuous, being less than 5&amp;nbsp; mm, and are usually invisible to the naked eye. Particles of this size are available to a much broader range of species, enter the food chain at the bottom, become embedded in animal tissue, and are then undetectable by unaided visual inspection.

Microplastics have been detected not just in marine but also in freshwater systems in three continents (Europe, North America and Asia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eerkes-Medrano |first1=D. |last2=Thompson |first2=R.C. |last3=Aldridge |first3=D.C. |date=May 2015 |title=Microplastics in freshwater systems: A review of the emerging threats, identification of knowledge gaps and prioritisation of research needs |url= |journal=Water Research |volume=75 |issue= |pages=63–82 |doi=10.1016/j.watres.2015.02.012|pmid=25746963 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Samples collected across 29 [[Great Lakes]] tributaries from six states in the United States were found to contain plastic particles, 98% of which were microplastics ranging in size from 0.355mm to 4.75mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baldwin |first1=Austin K. |last2=Corsi |first2=Steven R. |last3=Mason |first3=Sherri A. |date=2016 |title=Plastic Debris in 29 Great Lakes Tributaries: Relations to Watershed Attributes and Hydrology |url= |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=50 |issue=19 |pages=10377–10385 |doi=10.1021/acs.est.6b02917|pmid=27627676 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological integration into organisms===
Microplastics can become embedded in animals' tissue through ingestion or respiration. Various annelid species, such as deposit-feeding [[Lugworm|lugworms]] (''Arenicola marina''), have been shown to have microplastics embedded in their [[gastrointestinal tract]]s. Many [[Crustacean|crustaceans]], like the shore crab ''[[Carcinus maenas]]'', have been seen to integrate microplastics into both their respiratory and digestive tracts.&lt;ref name = "GrossmanJan" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid24972075&gt;{{cite journal |laydate=8 July 2014 |laysummary=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microplastics-lodge-crab-gills-and-guts |laysource=Science News |doi=10.1021/es501090e |pmid=24972075 |title=Uptake and Retention of Microplastics by the Shore Crab Carcinus maenas |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=48 |issue=15 |pages=8823–8830 |year=2014 |last1=Watts |first1=Andrew J.

E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[Bottom feeder|bottom feeders]], such as [[benthic]] [[Sea cucumber|sea cucumbers]], who are non-selective scavengers that feed on debris on the ocean floor, ingest large amounts of sediment. It has been shown that four species of sea cucumber (''Thyonella gemmate'', ''[[Holothuria floridana]]'', ''H. grisea'' and ''[[Cucumaria frondosa]]'') ingested between 2- and 20-fold more PVC fragments and between 2- and 138-fold more nylon line fragments (as much as 517 fibers per organism) based on plastic-to-sand grain ratios from each sediment treatment. These results suggest that individuals may be selectively ingesting plastic particles. This contradicts the accepted indiscriminate feeding strategy of sea cucumbers, and may occur in all presumed non-selective feeders when presented with microplastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2013.02.031 |pmid=23545014 |title=The physical impacts of microplastics on marine organisms: A review |journal=Environmental Pollution |volume=178 |pages=483–492 |year=2013 |last1=Wright |first1=Stephanie L. |last2=Thompson |first2=Richard C. |last3=Galloway |first3=Tamara S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only fish and free-living organisms can ingest microplastics. [[Scleractinia|Scleractinian corals]], which are primary reef-builders, have been shown to ingest microplastics under laboratory conditions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=N.M. |last1=Hall |first2=K.L.E. |last2=Berry |first3=L. |last3=Rintoul |first4=M.O. |last4=Hoogenboom |date=4 February 2015 |title=Microplastic ingestion by scleractinian corals |journal=Marine Biology |doi=10.1007/s00227-015-2619-7 |volume=162 |issue=3 |pages=725–732}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the effects of ingestion on these corals has not been studied, corals can easily become stressed and bleach. Microplastics have been shown to stick to the exterior of the corals after exposure in the laboratory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The adherence to the outside of corals can potentially be harmful, because corals cannot handle sediment or any particulate matter on their exterior and slough it off by secreting mucus, and they expend a large amount of energy in the process, increasing the chances of mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1007/978-90-481-2639-2_25 |chapter=Impacts of Sediment on Coral Reefs |title=Encyclopedia of Modern Coral Reefs |pages=575–586 |series=Encyclopedia of Earth Sciences Series |year=2011 |last1=Risk |first1=Michael J. |last2=Edinger |first2=Evan |isbn=978-90-481-2638-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zooplankton]] ingest microplastics beads (1.7–30.6 μm) and excrete fecal matter contaminated with microplastics.

It can take at least 14 days for microplastics to pass through an animal (as compared to a normal digestion periods of 2 days), but enmeshment of the particles in animals' [[gill]]s can prevent elimination entirely.&lt;ref name=pmid24972075/&gt; When microplastic-laden animals are consumed by predators, the microplastics are then incorporated into the bodies of higher trophic-level feeders.

The primary concern with human health in regards to microplastics is more directed towards the different toxic and carcinogenic chemicals used to make these plastics and what they carry. It has also been thought that microplastics can act as a vector for pathogens as well as heavy metals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weis|first=Judith|last2=Andrews|first2=Clinton J|last3=Dyksen|first3=John|last4=Ferrara|first4=Raymond|last5=Gannon|first5=John|last6=Laumbach|first6=Robert J|last7=Lederman|first7=Peter|last8=Lippencott|first8=Robert|last9=Rothman|first9=Nancy|date=2015|title=Human Health Impacts of Microplastics and Nanoplastics|url=https://www.state.nj.us/dep/sab/NJDEP-SAB-PHSC-final-2016.pdf|journal=NJDEP SAB Public Health Standing Committee|volume=|pages=23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Many people can expect to come in contact with various types of microplastics on a daily basis in the aforementioned sources (see sources). However, the average citizen is exposed to microplastics through their various types of food included in a normal diet. For instance: Salt. Researchers in China tested three types of table salt samples available in supermarkets and found the presence of microplastics in all of them. [[Sea salt]] has the highest amounts of microplastics compared to lake salt and rock/well salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/acs.est.5b03163 |pmid=26486565 |title=Microplastic Pollution in Table Salts from China |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=49 |issue=22 |pages=13622–13627 |year=2015 |last1=Yang |first1=Dongqi |last2=Shi |first2=Huahong |last3=Li |first3=Lan |last4=Li |first4=Jiana |last5=Jabeen |first5=Khalida |last6=Kolandhasamy |first6=Prabhu }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea salt and rock salt which are commonly used table salts in Spain have also been found to contain microplastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/s41598-017-09128-x |pmid=28819264 |pmc=5561224 |title=Microplastics in Spanish Table Salt |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=8620 |year=2017 |last1=Iñiguez |first1=Maria E. |last2=Conesa |first2=Juan A. |last3=Fullana |first3=Andres }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common type of microplastic found in both these studies was [[Polyethylene terephthalate|polyethylene terephthalate (PET).]]

An example of bioaccumulation in the food chain that leads to human exposure was a study done into the tissue samples of mussels to approximate concentration of microplastics.

A 2018 study conducted on eight individuals from Europe and Japan found microplastics in [[human feces]] for the first time. All participants were found positive for at least one type of microplastics after all of them had consumed plastic-wrapped food and drunk water from plastic bottles while six had also eaten seafood.

===Buoyancy===
Approximately half of the plastic material introduced to the marine environment is [[buoyant]], but fouling by organisms can cause plastic debris to sink to the [[sea floor]], where it may interfere with sediment-dwelling species and sedimental gas exchange processes. Several factors contribute to microplastic’s buoyancy, including the density of the plastic it is composed as well as the size and shape of the microplastic fragments themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/srep33882 |pmid=27721460 |pmc=5056413 |title=The effect of particle properties on the depth profile of buoyant plastics in the ocean |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=6 |pages=33882 |year=2016 |last1=Kooi |first1=Merel |last2=Reisser |first2=Julia |last3=Slat |first3=Boyan |last4=Ferrari |first4=Francesco F. |last5=Schmid |first5=Moritz S. |last6=Cunsolo |first6=Serena |last7=Brambini |first7=Roberto |last8=Noble |first8=Kimberly |last9=Sirks |first9=Lys-Anne |last10=Linders |first10=Theo E.

Additives added to plastics during manufacture may leach out upon ingestion, potentially causing serious harm to the organism. [[Endocrine disruption]] by plastic additives may affect the [[reproductive health]] of humans and wildlife alike.&lt;ref name=pmid19528054/&gt;

Plastics, polymers derived from [[mineral oil]]s, are virtually [[non-biodegradable]]. However, renewable natural polymers are now in development which can be used for the production of biodegradable materials similar to that of oil-based polymers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== Where microplastics can be found ==

=== Oceans ===
There is truly a staggering amount of microplastics in our world’s oceans.

=== Freshwater ecosystems ===
Though there have only been a few studies of microplastics in freshwater ecosystems, microplastics are being increasingly detected in the world’s aquatic environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2016.06.074 |pmid=27431693 |title=Microplastics in aquatic environments: Implications for Canadian ecosystems |journal=Environmental Pollution |volume=218 |pages=269–280 |year=2016 |last1=Anderson |first1=Julie C. |last2=Park |first2=Bradley J. |last3=Palace |first3=Vince P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first study on microplastics in freshwater ecosystems was published in 2011 that found an average of 37.8 fragments per square meter of Lake Huron sediment samples. Additionally, studies have found MP (microplastic) to be present in all of the Great Lakes with an average concentration of 43,000 MP particle km&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/anie.201606957 |pmid=27618688 |title=Microplastic in Aquatic Ecosystems |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |volume=56 |issue=7 |pages=1720–1739 |year=2017 |last1=Ivleva |first1=Natalia P. |last2=Wiesheu |first2=Alexandra C. |last3=Niessner |first3=Reinhard }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microplastics have also been detected in freshwater ecosystems outside of the United States. The highest concentration of microplastic ever discovered in a studied freshwater ecosystem was recorded in the Rhine river at 4000 MP particles kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/acs.est.7b05367 |pmid=29337537 |pmc=5822217 |title=Microplastic Effect Thresholds for Freshwater Benthic Macroinvertebrates |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=2278–2286 |year=2018 |last1=Redondo-Hasselerharm |first1=Paula E. |last2=Falahudin |first2=Dede |last3=Peeters |first3=Edwin T. H. M. |last4=Koelmans |first4=Albert A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soil ===
A substantial portion of microplastics are expected to end up in the world’s soil, yet very little research has been conducted on microplastics in soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/fpls.2017.01805 |pmid=29093730 |pmc=5651362 |title=Microplastic Incorporation into Soil in Agroecosystems |journal=Frontiers in Plant Science |volume=8 |pages=1805 |year=2017 |last1=Rillig |first1=Matthias C. |last2=Ingraffia |first2=Rosolino |last3=De Souza Machado |first3=Anderson A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; There exists some speculation that fibrous secondary microplastics from washing machines could end up in soil through the failure of water treatment plants to completely filter out all of the microplastic fibers. Furthermore, [[geophagous soil fauna]], such as earthworms, mites, and collembolan could contribute to the amount of secondary microplastic present in soil by converting consumed plastic debris into microplastic via digestive processes. Further research, however, is needed. There is concrete data linking one the use of organic waste materials to synthetic fibers being found in the soil; but most studies on plastics in soil merely report its presence and do not quantify how much there is or where it came from.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es302011r |pmid=22676039 |title=Microplastic in Terrestrial Ecosystems and the Soil? |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=46 |issue=12 |pages=6453–6454 |year=2012 |last1=Rillig |first1=Matthias C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the air ===
Airborne microplastics have been detected in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], as well as indoors and outdoors. A 2017 study found indoor airborne microfiber concentrations between 1.0–60.0 microfibers per cubic meter (33% of which were found to be microplastics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.coesh.2017.10.002 |title=Microplastics in air: Are we breathing it in? |journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Science &amp; Health |volume=1 |pages=1–5 |year=2018 |last1=Gasperi |first1=Johnny |last2=Wright |first2=Stephanie L. |last3=Dris |first3=Rachid |last4=Collard |first4=France |last5=Mandin |first5=Corinne |last6=Guerrouache |first6=Mohamed |last7=Langlois |first7=Valérie |last8=Kelly |first8=Frank J. |last9=Tassin |first9=Bruno }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study looked at microplastic in the street dust of Tehran Iran and found 2649 particles of microplastic within ten samples of street dust, with ranging samples concentrations from 83 particle – 605 particles (+/- 10) per 30.0 g of street dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11356-017-9674-1 |pmid=28707239 |title=Microplastic pollution in deposited urban dust, Tehran metropolis, Iran |journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research |volume=24 |issue=25 |pages=20360–20371 |year=2017 |last1=Dehghani |first1=Sharareh |last2=Moore |first2=Farid |last3=Akhbarizadeh |first3=Razegheh }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, much like freshwater ecosystems and soil, more studies are needed to understand the full impact and significance of airborne microplastics.

== Proposed solutions ==
Some researchers have proposed incinerating plastics to use as energy, which is known as energy recovery. As opposed to losing the energy from plastics into the atmosphere in [[Landfill|landfills]], this process turns some of the plastics back into energy that can be used. However, as opposed to recycling, this method does not diminish the amount of plastic material that is produced. Therefore, recycling plastics is considered a more efficient solution.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Increasing education through recycling campaigns is another proposed solution for microplastic contamination. While this would be a smaller scale solution, education has been shown to reduce littering, especially in urban environments where there are often large concentrations of plastic waste.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; If recycling efforts are increased, a cycle of plastic use and reuse would be created to decrease our waste output and production of new raw materials. In order to achieve this, states would need to employ stronger infrastructure and investment around recycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kershaw|first=Peter J.|date=2016|title=Marine Plastic Debris and Microplastics|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/marine/good-environmental-status/descriptor-10/pdf/Marine_plastic_debris_and_microplastic_technical_report_advance_copy.pdf|dead-url=No|journal=[[United Nations Environment Programme]]|volume=|pages=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011052123/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/marine/good-environmental-status/descriptor-10/pdf/Marine_plastic_debris_and_microplastic_technical_report_advance_copy.pdf|archive-date=11 October 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some advocate for improving recycling technology to be able to recycle smaller plastics to reduce the need for production of new plastics.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Biodegradation is another possible solution to large amounts of microplastic waste. In this process, microorganisms consume and decompose synthetic polymers with using degrading enzymes.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Auta|first=H.S.|last2=Emenike|first2=C.U|last3=Fauziah|first3=S.H|date=May 2017|title=Distribution and importance of microplastics in the marine environment: A review of the sources, fate, effects, and potential solutions|url=|journal=[[Environment International]]|volume=102|pages=165–176|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2017.02.013|pmid=28284818|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plastics can then be used in the form of energy and as a source of [[carbon]] once broken down. The microbes could potentially be used to treat sewage wastewater, which would decrease the amount of microplastics that pass through into the surrounding environments.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==Policy and legislation==
With increasing awareness of the detrimental effects of microplastics on the environment, groups are now advocating for the removal and ban of microplastics from various products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.10.001 |title=Reducing marine pollution from single-use plastics (SUPs): A review |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=137 |pages=157–171 |year=2018 |last1=Schnurr |first1=Riley E.J. |last2=Alboiu |first2=Vanessa |last3=Chaudhary |first3=Meenakshi |last4=Corbett |first4=Roan A. |last5=Quanz |first5=Meaghan E. |last6=Sankar |first6=Karthikeshwar |last7=Srain |first7=Harveer S. |last8=Thavarajah |first8=Venukasan |last9=Xanthos |first9=Dirk |last10=Walker |first10=Tony R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such campaign is "Beat the Microbead", which focuses on removing plastics from personal care products.&lt;ref name = "BeattheMicrobead" /&gt; The Adventurers and Scientists for Conservation run the Global Microplastics Initiative, a project to collect water samples to provide scientists with better data about microplastic dispersion in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Microplastics Initiative|url=http://www.adventurescientists.org/microplastics.html|publisher=Adventure Scientists|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] has sponsored research and global assessment programs due to the trans-boundary issue that microplastic pollution constitutes.&lt;ref name="GreenFacts"&gt;Morris and Chapman: "Marine Litter", "Green Facts: Facts on Health and the Environment", 2001-2015&lt;/ref&gt; These environmental groups will keep pressuring companies to remove plastics from their products in order to maintain healthy ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Philip: "'Microplastics' In Great Lakes Pose 'Very Real Threat' To Humans and Animals", International Business Times, 29 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

;United States

In the US, some states have taken action to mitigate the negative environmental effects of microplastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.02.048 |pmid=28238328 |title=International policies to reduce plastic marine pollution from single-use plastics (plastic bags and microbeads): A review |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=118 |issue=1–2 |pages=17–26 |year=2017 |last1=Xanthos |first1=Dirk |last2=Walker |first2=Tony R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Illinois was the first US state to ban cosmetics containing microplastics.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; On the national level, the [[Microbead-Free Waters Act 2015]] was enacted after being signed by President [[Barack Obama]] on December 28, 2015. The law bans "rinse-off" cosmetic products that perform an exfoliating function, such as toothpaste or face wash. It does not apply to other products such as household cleaners. The act took effect on July 1, 2017, with respect to manufacturing, and July 1, 2018, with respect to introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce.&lt;ref name="PL114-114"&gt;United States. Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015. {{uspl|114|114}}. Approved 2015-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25th, 2018, a microplastic reduction amendment was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/756/text|title=Text - S.756 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): Save Our Seas Act of 2018|last=Dan|first=Sullivan|date=2018-07-26|website=www.congress.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation, as part of the Save Our Seas Act designed to combat marine pollution, aims to support the [[NOAA]]'s Marine Debris Program. In particular, the amendment is geared towards promoting NOAA’s Great Lakes Land-Based Marine Debris Action Plan to increase testing, cleanup, and education around plastic pollution in the Great Lakes.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; President [[Donald Trump]] signed the re-authorization and amendment bill into effect on October 11, 2018.

'''Japan'''

On June 15th, 2018, the Japanese government passed a bill with the goal of reducing microplastic production and pollution, especially in aquatic environments.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/06/15/national/bill-reduce-microplastics-released-environment-passed-japans-upper-house/|title=Bill to reduce microplastics released into the environment passed by Japan’s Upper House|last=|first=|date=15 June 2018|work=[[The Japan Times]]|access-date=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed by the Environment Ministry and passed unanimously by the Upper House, this is also the first bill to pass in Japan that is specifically targeted at reducing microplastic production, specifically in the personal care industry with products such as face wash and toothpaste.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This law is revised from previous legislation, which focused on removing plastic marine debris. It also focuses on increasing education and public awareness surrounding recycling and plastic waste.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The Environment Ministry has also proposed a number of recommendations for methods to monitor microplastic quantities in the ocean (Recommendations, 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 2018|title=Recommendations by Experts on the Required Parameters for Microplastics Monitoring in the Ocean|url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/water/marine_litter/pdf/recommendation.pdf|journal=Ministry of Environment, Japan|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the legislation does not specify any penalties for those who continue manufacturing products with microplastics.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

'''United Kingdom'''

The "Environmental Protection (Microbeads) (England) Regulations 2017" law from passed by the UK government bans the production of any rinse-off personal care products (such as exfoliants) containing microbeads.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017|title=The Environmental Protection (Microbeads) (England) Regulations 2017|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/1312/pdfs/uksi_20171312_en.pdf|journal=Cabinet of the United Kingdom|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular law denotes specific penalties when it is not obeyed. Those who do not comply are required to pay a fine. In the event that a fine is not paid, product manufacturers may receive a stop notice, which prevents the manufacturer from continuing production until they have followed regulation preventing the use of microbeads. Criminal proceedings may occur if the stop notice is ignored.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

== Action for creating awareness ==
On April 11, 2013 in order to create awareness, artist [[Maria Cristina Finucci]] founded The [[Garbage patch state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/venice/about-this-office/single-view/news/the_garbage_patch_territory_turns_into_a_new_state/#.U71u8fl_u9U|title=The garbage patch territory turns into a new state
|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the patronage of [[UNESCO]] and the Italian Ministry of the Environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rivistasitiunesco.it/articolo.php?id_articolo=2073 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714144707/http://www.rivistasitiunesco.it/articolo.php?id_articolo=2073 |archivedate=2014-07-14 |title=Rifiuti diventano stato, Unesco riconosce 'Garbage Patch' |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) launched its "Trash-Free Waters" initiative in 2013 to prevent single-use plastic wastes from ending up in waterways and ultimately the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deq.virginia.gov/Portals/0/DEQ/CoastalZoneManagement/EPA_Trash_Free_Waters_Program_Virginia_Marine_Debris_Summit_2013.pdf |title=EPA National Trash Free Waters Program |last1=Benson |first1=Bob |last2=Weiler |first2=Katherine |last3=Crawford |first3=Cara |date=2013-02-27 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.|id=Presentation at Virginia Marine Debris Summit, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA collaborates with the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]–Caribbean Environment Programme (UNEP-CEP) and the [[Peace Corps]] to reduce and also remove trash in the [[Caribbean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/trash-free-waters/international-initiatives-address-marine-debris |title=International Initiatives to Address Marine Debris |date=2018-04-18 |website=Trash-Free Waters |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA has also funded various projects in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] including one that is aimed at reducing the use of single-use plastics such as disposable cups, spoons and straws, from three [[University of California]] campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/trash-free-waters/trash-free-waters-projects |title=Trash-Free Waters Projects |date=2017-09-27 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there are many organizations advocating action to counter microplastics and that is spreading microplastic awareness. One such group is the Florida Microplastic Awareness Project (FMAP), a group of volunteers who search for microplastics in coastal water samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sfyl.ifas.ufl.edu/flagler/marine-and-coastal/microplastics/|title=Microplastics  - UF/IFAS Extension|last=Communications|first=IFAS|website=sfyl.ifas.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cleanup ==
Computer modelling done by [[The Ocean Cleanup]], a Netherlands foundation, has suggested that collecting devices placed nearer to the coasts could remove about 31% of the microplastics in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Connor |first=Steve |date=2016-01-19 |title=How scientists plan to clean up plastic waste in the oceans |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/how-scientists-plan-to-clean-up-the-plastic-waste-threatening-marine-life-a6820276.html |work=The Independent |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Marine_debris#Environmental_impact|some bacteria]] have evolved to eat plastic, and some bacteria species have been genetically modified to eat (certain types of) plastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://aabgu.org/eating-away-the-worlds-plastic-waste-problem/|title=Eating Away the World's Plastic Waste Problem |date=2017-01-23 |website=News; Natural Sciences |publisher=American Associates, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 9, 2018, The Ocean Cleanup launched the world’s first ocean cleanup system, 001 aka “Wilson”, which is being deployed to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theoceancleanup.com/updates/system-001-has-launched-into-the-pacific/|title=System 001 has launched into the Pacific|last=www.theoceancleanup.com|first=The Ocean Cleanup,|work=The Ocean Cleanup|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt; System 001 is 600 meters long that acts as a U-shaped skiff that uses natural oceanic currents to concentrate plastic and other debris on the ocean’s surface into a confined area for extraction by vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theoceancleanup.com/technology/|title=The Ocean Cleanup Technology|last=www.theoceancleanup.com|first=The Ocean Cleanup|website=The Ocean Cleanup|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has been met with criticism from oceanographers and plastic pollution experts, though it has seen wide public support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deepseanews.com/2014/07/the-ocean-cleanup-part-2-technical-review-of-the-feasibility-study/|title=The Ocean Cleanup, Part 2: Technical review of the feasibility study|last=Martini|first=Kim|last2=Goldstein|first2=Miriam|date=14 July 2014|website=Deep Sea News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.southernfriedscience.com/i-asked-15-ocean-plastic-pollution-experts-about-the-ocean-cleanup-project-and-they-have-concerns/|title=I asked 15 ocean plastic pollution experts about the Ocean Cleanup project, and they have concerns|last=Shiffman|first=David|date=13 June 2018|website=Southern Fried Science|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/26/ocean-cleanup-project-environment-pollution-boyan-slat|title=Too good to be true?

'''Natural evil''' is [[evil]] for which “no non-divine agent can be held morally responsible for its occurrence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nick |last=Trakakis|title=The Evidential Problem of Evil |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (IEP) |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/evil-evi/#SH1b}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, [[moral evil]] is “caused by human activity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~grosen/puc/phi203/evil.html|title=The Problem of Evil|work=princeton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of natural evil challenges belief in the [[omnibenevolence]] or the [[omnipotence]] of [[deities]] and the existence of deities including [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Martin, ''Atheism: A Philosophical Justification'' (Temple University Press, 1992), 412.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of natural evil==
Moral evil results from a perpetrator, or one who acts intentionally and in so doing has flouted some duty or engaged in some vice. Natural evil has only victims, and is generally taken to be the result of natural processes. The "evil" thus identified is evil only from the perspective of those affected and who perceive it as an affliction. Examples include cancer, birth defects, tornadoes, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, [[Act of God|acts of God]], and other phenomena which inflict suffering with apparently no accompanying mitigating good. Such phenomena inflict "evil" on victims with no perpetrator to blame.

In the [[Bible]], God is portrayed as both the ultimate creator and perpetrator, since the “sun, moon and stars, celestial activity, clouds, dew, frost, hail, lightning, rain, snow, thunder, and wind are all subject to God's command.”&lt;ref&gt;''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary'', s.v. “Providence of God.”&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of natural evils ascribed to God follow:

[[File:118.Job Hears of His Misfortunes.jpg|thumb|[[Gustave Doré]]: ''Doré's English Bible'' "[[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] Hears of His Misfortunes" (Job 1:1-22)]]
:* Floods: God brought “a flood of waters on the earth” (Genesis 6:17).
:* Thunder, hail, lightning: God “sent thunder and hail, and fire came down” (Exodus 9:23).
:* Destructive Wind: God sent a “great wind” that destroyed Job’s house and killed his family ([[Book of Job|Job]] 1:19).
:* Earthquake: By the Lord “the earth will be shaken” (Isaiah 13:13).
:* Drought and Famine: God will shut off rains, so neither land nor trees yield produce (Leviticus 26:19-20).
:* Forest fires: God says, “Say to the southern forest, 'I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you and every dry tree'” (Ezekiel 20:47).

Traditional theism (e.g. [[Thomas Aquinas]]) distinguishes between God's will and God's permission, claiming that while God permits evil, he does not will it.&lt;ref&gt;David Bentley Hart, ''The Doors of the Sea: Where Was God in the Tsunami?'' (William B. Eerdmans, 2005), pp. 82–89.&lt;/ref&gt;  This distinction is echoed by some modern [[open theism|open theists]], e.g. [[Gregory A. Boyd]], who writes, "Divine goodness does not completely control or in any sense will evil."&lt;ref&gt;Gregory A. Boyd, God at War: the Bible and Spiritual Conflict (InterVarsity Press,1997) 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas partly explained this in terms of primary and secondary [[causality]], whereby God is the primary (or transcendent) cause of the world, but not the secondary (or immanent) cause of everything that occurs in it. Such accounts explain the presence of natural evil through the story of the [[Fall of man]], which affected not only human beings, but nature as well (Genesis 3:16–19).

Especially since the Reformation the distinction between God's will and God's permission, and between primary and secondary causality, has been disputed, notably by [[John Calvin]]. Among modern inheritors of this tradition, Mark R. Talbot ascribes evil to God: “God’s foreordination is the ultimate reason why everything comes about, including the existence of all evil persons and things and the occurrence of any evil acts or events.”&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Talbot, “All the Good That Is Ours in Christ,” in Suffering and the Sovereignty of God, ed. John Piper and Justin Taylor, 43-44 (Crossway Books, 2006). Available online at [http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/OnlineBooks/ByTitle/ desiringgod.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Such models of God's complete foreordination and direct willing of everything that happens lead to the doctrines of [[double predestination]] and [[limited atonement]].&lt;ref&gt;David Bentley Hart, ''The Doors of the Sea: Where Was God in the Tsunami?'' (William B. Eerdmans, 2005), pp. 89–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural versus moral evil==
{{Main|Moral evil}}
[[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] responded to [[Voltaire|Voltaire's]] criticism of the optimists by pointing out that the [[value judgement]] required in order to declare the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] a natural evil ignored the fact that the human endeavour of the construction and organization of the city of Lisbon was also to blame for the horrors recounted as they had contributed to the level of suffering. It was, after all, the collapsing buildings, the fires, and the close human confinement that led to much of the death.

The question of whether [[natural disaster]]s such as [[hurricane]]s might be natural or moral evil is complicated by new understandings of the effects, such as [[global warming]], of our [[collective action]]s on events that were previously considered to be out of our control. Nonetheless, even before the beginning of the Industrial Revolution (which many believe was the beginning point of global warming), natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, flooding, fires, disease, etc.) occurred regularly, and cannot be ascribed to the actions of humans. However, human actions exacerbate the evil effects of natural disasters. The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) says human activity is a key factor that turns “extreme weather events into greater natural disasters.” For example, “deforestation and floodplain development” by humans turn high rainfall into “devastating floods and mudslides." When humans damage coastal reefs, remove mangroves, destroy dune systems, or clear coastal forests, "extreme coastal events cause much more loss of life and damage.” Damage by tsunamis varied “according to the extent of reef protection and remaining mangrove coverage.” 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/fr/news/local_news/Natural-disasters-made-worse-by-human-activity-_43194.html|title=Natural disasters made worse by human activity|work=expatica.com|accessdate=August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, human development has “contributed to more frequent and regular floods.”&lt;ref&gt;“Natural Disasters Made Worse by Human Activity” (May 20, 2008), [http://www.expatica.com/fr/news/local_news/Natural-disasters-made-worse-by-human-activity-_43194.html# Expatica.com], accessed December 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In earthquakes, people often suffer injury or death because of “poorly designed and constructed buildings.”&lt;ref&gt;“UN Says Poor Construction to Blame for Earthquake Deaths — May 19, 2008,” [http://www.expatica.com/fr/news/local_news/UN-says-poor-construction-to-blame-for-earthquake-deaths-_43155.html Expatica.com], accessed December 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, wildfires that destroy lives and property aren't "entirely natural.” Some fires are caused by human action and the damage inflicted is sometimes magnified by building “in remote, fire-prone areas.”&lt;ref&gt;“Southern California Forest Fires,”  [http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/top10/article/0,30583,1686204_1686252_1690605,00.html time.com], accessed December 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Dusty conditions in the West that “can cause significant human health problems” have been shown to be “a direct result of human activity and not part of the natural system."&lt;ref&gt;“Dust in West up 500 Percent in Past 2 Centuries, says CU-Boulder Study,” [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-02/uoca-diw022208.php eurekalert.org], accessed December 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In sum, there is evidence that some "natural" evil results from human activity and, therefore, contains an element of moral evil.

==Challenge to religious belief==
Natural evil (also non-moral or surd evil) is a term generally used in discussions of the [[problem of evil]] and [[theodicy]] that refers to states of affairs which, considered in themselves, are those that are part of the natural world, and so are independent of the intervention of a human [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]]. Both natural and moral evil are a challenge to religious believers. Many atheists claim that natural evil is proof that there is no God, at least not an [[omnipotent]], [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] one, as such a being would not allow such evil to happen to his/her creation. However, the [[deist]] position states that intervention by God to prevent such actions (or any intervention) is not an attribute of God.

'''Pearl bodies''' are small (0.5 - 3.0&amp;nbsp;mm), lustrous, pearl-like food bodies produced from the epidermis of leaves, petioles and shoots of certain plants. They are rich in [[lipids]], [[proteins]] and [[carbohydrates]], and are sought after by various arthropods and ants, that carry out vigorous protection of the plant against herbivores, thus functioning as a biotic defence. They are globose or club-shaped on short peduncles, easily detached from the plant, and are food sources in the same sense as [[Beltian body|Beltian bodies]], Müllerian bodies, Beccarian bodies, [[Coccid]] secretions and [[nectar]]ies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kew.org/Glossary/pearl-bodies.htm&lt;/ref&gt; They occur in at least 19 plant families (1982) with tropical and subtropical distribution.&lt;ref&gt;''"Piper: A Model Genus for Studies of Phytochemistry, Ecology, and Evolution"'' - Lee A. Dyer, Aparna Palmer (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cells or tissues that offer food rewards to arthropods are commonplace in the plant world and are an important way of establishing symbiotic relationships.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2707332 | pmid=19049986 | doi=10.1093/aob/mcn237 | volume=103 | issue=3 | title=Food bodies in Cissus verticillata (Vitaceae): ontogenesis, structure and functional aspects | year=2009 | journal=Ann.

Pearl bodies appear to be the primary, and possibly the only nutrient for ants inhabiting Central American [[myrmecophytes]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insectscience.org/9.27/i1536-2442-9-27.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Phytophagous mites such as ''Tetranychus kanzawai'' have been observed feeding on pearl bodies produced by ''[[Cayratia japonica]]'' of the family [[Vitaceae]], a family in which pearl bodies are common. It also appears possible that the predatory mite ''[[Euseius sojaensis]]'' uses the pearl bodies as an alternative food source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11284-008-0501-5#page-2 | doi=10.1007/s11284-008-0501-5 | volume=24 | issue=2 | title=Pearl bodies of Cayratia japonica (Thunb.)

Pearl bodies are important in the association between the ant species ''[[Pheidole]] bicornis'' and various ''[[Piper (genus)|Piper]]'' species that have spaces between the leaf petiole and stem suitable for use as ant domatia. Some ''Piper'' species have stems hollowed out by the ants, while others have naturally hollow stems. These tunnels are 3 – 4&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, and, when the ants are in residence, numerous pearl bodies grow from the adaxial surfaces of the petioles, and from the tunnel walls.&lt;ref&gt;http://si-pddr.si.edu/bitstream/10088/12200/1/stri_Tepe_Vincent_and_Watson_2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Deborah K Letourneau in 1983 found that the ants were so sated by the plant's pearl bodies that more than half the insect eggs they encountered while patrolling were dropped to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;''"Insect Ecology: Behavior, Populations and Communities"'' - R. F. Denno, M. D. Eubanks&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Mallotus japonicus]]'' extrafloral nectaries and pearl bodies function as a biotic defence, while a second line of defence is made up [[trichomes]] and pellucid dots containing toxic secondary [[metabolites]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/content/106/1/143.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rebar detailing''' is the discipline of preparing 'shop/placing' drawings or [[Shop drawing|shop drawings]] of steel reinforcement for [[construction]].

[[Architect]]/[[Engineer]]s(A/E) prepare 'Design Drawings' that develop required strengths by applying [[rebar]] size, spacing, location, and lap of [[steel]].

By contrast, 'Shop/Placing Drawings' apply the intent of the 'Design drawings' for the ironworker. They call out the quantity, description, placement, bending shapes with dimensions and laps of the reinforcing steel. Various applications are used to produce bar bending schedules which can be directly fed into CNC machines that cuts and bends the rebar to the desired shapes.

The fabrication of the bars are scheduled and the placing/fixing sequence indicated, adding the elements required to support those bars during construction.

'Shop/Placing Drawings' are submitted to the A/E for review of compliance with design drawings before construction can proceed. These drawings must be detailed using the ACI &amp; CRSI Specifications (United States), ACI &amp; RSIC Specifications (Canada).

Rebar detailing is usually assigned to Rebar Fabricators in-house teams, and rebar detailing companies. The great majority of rebar detailing companies are stationed in The Middle East and India. However there are a few Rebar Detailers in the United States, but not many due to the low cost of having the detailing done overseas. The wages for a Rebar Detailer in the US and Canada is from $30,000 to $90,000 per year but the large fabricators will send it overseas where it will only cost them between $3,000 and $7,000 per year because of the difference in the money value.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

The '''Reich Bride Schools''' ([[German language|German]]: '''''Reichsbräuteschule''''') were institutions established in [[Nazi Germany]] in the late 1930s. They were created to train young women to be "perfect Nazi brides,"&lt;ref name="NewYorker" /&gt; indoctrinated in Nazi ideology and educated in housekeeping skills. The fiancées of prominent  [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members and senior [[Nazi Party]] officials (and later a wider range of German women) were taught skills ranging from cooking, child care, ironing and to how to polish their husbands' uniforms and daggers. They were required to swear oaths of loyalty to [[Adolf Hitler]], to pledge to raise their children as Nazis and to marry in what the Nazis alleged to be ceremonies based on pre-Christian model—ceremonies that by Nazi officials presided over, rather than ceremonies in churches.

Although a number of bride schools were established in locations across Germany, the demands of the [[Second World War]] made it impossible for the Nazis to realise their ideal of women as being exclusively home-bound. Many women took up work instead in munitions factories and other war-related roles. Even so, the schools appear to have continued until as late as May 1944 but their existence faded from memory after the war, perhaps as a result of an unwillingness on the part of former Nazi brides to discuss their enrollment. The discovery in 2013 of original documentation relating to the schools resulted in fresh attention being brought to this particular chapter in the history of Nazi Germany.

==Women in the Nazi worldview==
{{main|Women in Nazi Germany}}
Women had a clearly defined position in the Nazi worldview. They were not deemed suitable for professions such as medicine, the law or the civil service, from which they were banned. They were instead expected to stay at home, maintain the household and have as many children as possible.&lt;ref name="NewYorker" /&gt; A woman's place was defined by the slogan ''kinder, küche, kirche'' (children, kitchen, church).&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; Reproductive success was rewarded with the ''[[Ehrenkreuz der Deutschen Mutter]]'' (Cross of Honour of the German Mother), which was awarded in bronze, silver and gold ranks – the latter going to mothers who had eight or more children.&lt;ref name="NewYorker"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/09/the-perfect-nazi-bride.html|title=The Perfect Nazi Bride|last=Greenhouse|first=Emily|work=The New Yorker|date=29 September 2013|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis considered that the social changes that had taken place since the end of the [[First World War]], including a fall in birth rates and an increasing number of divorces, were undermining German society and the German race. Large families and a reversion to traditional gender roles were seen as essential, not least as a means of breeding future soldiers.&lt;ref name="GHI" /&gt; The Nazi government passed a Law for the Encouragement of Marriage which enabled newlyweds to take out a state loan of 1,000 [[reichsmark]]s (approximately €3,500) and keep a quarter for each child they had, in effect subsidising procreation.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

Hitler told a conference of the [[National Socialist Women's League]] (''NS-Frauenschaft'') in September 1938: "The slogan 'Emancipation of women' was invented by Jewish intellectuals and its content was formed by the same spirit. In the really good times of German life the German woman had no need to emancipate herself ... If the man's world is said to be the State, his struggle, his readiness to devote his powers to the service of the community, then it may perhaps be said that the woman's is a smaller world. For her world is her husband, her family, her children, and her home."&lt;ref name="GHI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=1557|title=Hitler’s Speech to the National Socialist Women’s League (September 8, 1934)|publisher=German Historical Institute, Washington, DC|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazi viewpoint was summed up by Hermann Göring in his "Nine Commandments for the Workers’ Struggle", published in 1934, in which he exhorted women to "take hold of the frying pan, dust pan, and broom, and marry a man."&lt;ref name="NewYorker" /&gt; Young girls were compelled to join the [[League of German Girls]] (''Bund Deutscher Mädel'') while older women became members of the NS-Frauenschaft. [[Gertrud Scholtz-Klink]], the head of the NS-Frauenschaft, told a Nazi party conference in 1935 that "women must be the spiritual caregivers and the secret queens of our people, called upon by fate for this special task."&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/10/01/nazi_bride_schools_educated_german_women_in_racial_values_and_homemaking.html|title=At Least You’re Not at Nazi Bride School|last=Waldman|first=Katy|work=Slate|date=1 October 2013|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment==

In 1936, ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] came to an agreement with Scholtz-Klink to put her views into practice, with Himmler issuing a decree ordering women engaged to SS members to undergo training in how to become brides who would conform to the Nazi ideal of how women should live.&lt;ref name="NewYorker" /&gt; They were also to undergo training to provide them with "special knowledge of race and genetics."&lt;ref name="DieWelt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Abschlussprüfung für die perfekte SS-Braut|url=https://www.welt.de/geschichte/zweiter-weltkrieg/article118919362/Abschlusspruefung-fuer-die-perfekte-SS-Braut.html|last=Becker|first=Claudia|work=Die Welt|language=German|date=12 August 2013|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A newspaper article published at the time stated that the schools they would attend would aim "to mould housewives out of office girls."&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/10247550/Nazi-Bride-Schools-These-girls-were-the-nucleus-of-the-Reich.html|title=Nazi Bride Schools: 'These girls were the nucleus of the Reich’|last=Rainey|first=Sarah|work=Daily Telegraph|date=16 August 2013|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools for mothers (''Mütterschulen'') were not a new phenomenon in Germany; the first had been established in [[Stuttgart]] in 1917. By 1933 there were 37 such institutions in Germany, aiming to counteract the high infant mortality rate that resulted from the poor diet, bad hygiene and arduous working lives of many women in [[Weimar Germany]].&lt;ref name="DieWelt" /&gt; Housekeeping was a much more complex and labour-intensive task than it is today, with tasks such as cleaning, laying a fire, shopping, cooking and looking after children requiring much more effort.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; After 1933 the Nazis saw ''Mütterschulen'' as providing not only a way of educating women in housekeeping, but a means of indoctrinating them in Nazi ideology.&lt;ref name="DieWelt" /&gt; The administration of the ''Mütterschulen'' was taken over by the NS-Frauenschaft and the [[Deutsches Frauenwerk]] (German Women's Enterprise) and the number of women attending grew rapidly; by 1937, 1.14 million women had participated in over 53,000 courses.&lt;ref name="DHM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/nazi/alltagsleben/muetterschulen/index.html|title=Mütterschulen im NS-Regime|language=German|publisher=Deutsches Historiches Museum|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Reich Bride School was established in 1937 on [[Schwanenwerder]], an island in the [[Havel]] river in the [[Berlin]] locality of [[Nikolassee]]. It occupied a villa which served as a model household, in which groups of up to twenty young women would live for a six-week course.&lt;ref name="NewYorker" /&gt; An official pamphlet stated: "In circles of 20 students, young girls should attend courses at the institute, preferably two months before their wedding day, to recuperate spiritually and physically, to forget the daily worries associated with their previous professions, to find the way and to feel the joy for their new lives as wives." They were charged 135 [[reichsmark]]s (equivalent to about €470 at today's prices) for the course.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; Other Reich Bride Schools were soon established; by 1940 there were nine in Berlin alone, and schools were also established in other German cities such as [[Oldenburg]] and [[Tübingen]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

==Training and indoctrination==

The training given at the schools included a variety of household skills such as cooking, ironing, gardening, child care and animal husbandry.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; Even [[interior design]] was addressed; an article in the magazine ''Das schöne Heim'' ("The Beautiful Home") described how Nazi brides were encouraged to adopt a "clear and clean" interior style in which only "German woods are used in beautiful grain."&lt;ref name="DieWelt" /&gt; Other topics of study included how to make suitable conversation at cocktail parties, cleaning a husband's uniform and polishing a husband's boots and dagger.&lt;ref name="Slate" /&gt; They were also taught German folk songs, legends and fairy tales to infuse them with a sense of "national community" (''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'').&lt;ref name="DHM" /&gt; The women were required to pledge to raise their children in accordance with National Socialist beliefs, to be loyal to Hitler throughout their lives and to marry in faux neo-pagan ceremonies led by Nazi Party members, rather than in church. On completion of the course, they were issued with certificates stamped with the [[Runic insignia of the Schutzstaffel|''Lebensrune'']] symbolising life; if they dropped out, they were refused permission to marry.&lt;ref name="NewYorker" /&gt;

The schools were initially aimed at educating the future wives of the Nazi elite – prominent members of the SS and the Nazi Party. Eventually they were opened to all "racially suitable" German women, thus excluding anyone with Jewish or gypsy heritage, physical disability, or a history of mental illness.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; Nazi propaganda publicised the schools' activities in articles such as one covering the Oldenburg Reich Bride School, published in May 1940 in the ''[[NS-Frauen-Warte|Frauen Warte]]'', the Nazi Party’s bi-weekly illustrated magazine for women. It showed in a series of photographs how the brides were taught how to use gardening tools, practising cooking and animal husbandry, picking and arranging flowers, and undergoing courses in cooking, sewing, and baby care, knitting and weaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/fw8-22b.htm|title=Gelernt ist gelernt: Mit Bildbericht aus der Reichsbräute- und Heimmütterschule Husbäke in Oldenburg|language=German|work=NS Frauen Warte|publisher=Randall Bytwerk, Calvin College|location=Grand Rapids, MI|date=May 1940|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying text, written from the point of view of a mother recalling her time at the Reich Bride School, says:

{{quote|The days were full, the training thorough, and the evenings of reading, singing, and games were delightful. The future families they would have as wives and mothers were always at the center of the programme. That gave the six weeks [of the course] the unity and organization that so pleased the brides, creating that atmosphere of community that would last past the course. The fact that most of the girls were engaged to soldiers at the front strengthened the sense of togetherness, both in good and bad times. How happy the young woman is that she can still be with her husband. She wants to use weeks until he may be called up to build a comfortable home for him and make the few weekend hours he has at home warm and treasured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/fw8-22b.htm|title=An Illustrated Report from the Reich Brides’ and Housewives’ School at Husbäke in Oldenburg|work=NS Frauen Warte|publisher=Randall Bytwerk, Calvin College|location=Grand Rapids, MI|date=May 1940|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Dr Marius Turda of [[Oxford Brookes University]], "the bride schools perfectly illustrate the Nazi regime’s ambition to control its population, both privately and publicly. A good German wife was supposed to be a supportive mother and a promoter of racial values in the family."&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; They also represented a political gambit by NS-Frauenschaft leader Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, whose collaboration with Himmler to set up the schools resulted in a politically valuable alliance between her organisation and the SS, a rising power within the Nazi establishment. According to the historian [[Michael Burleigh]], the explicitly faux neo-pagan and anti-Christian stance of the bride schools was particularly noteworthy. Dr Julia Torrie of [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St Thomas University]] in [[New Brunswick]] notes that the underlying theme of the bride schools was that they defined the family as exclusively [[Aryan race#Nazism|Aryan]]; as she puts it, "Exercising the kind of domesticity that a woman learnt at an SS bride school was, in a sense, 'living' her Nazism."&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

The Reich Bride Schools continued their activities until at least May 1944, but the pressures of war appear to have curtailed them before the final collapse of Nazi Germany the following year.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; Women took up new roles on the "home front", working in munitions factories or assisting the military. Although this contradicted the original idea of women being confined to the home, Scholtz-Klink justified it on the grounds that they now had a "higher obligation" that demanded their contributions to the war effort.&lt;ref name="DieWelt" /&gt; After the war, the bride schools fell into obscurity and information about them is still scarce; as Marius Turda puts it, "It is possible that, after the war, former Nazis and their spouses who had graduated were rather reluctant to talk about these schools." However, in 2013, Nazi-era documentation about the schools was discovered in the German federal archives in [[Koblenz]], including a rule book containing details of the oaths that brides had to swear and the certificates awarded to them at the end of their courses.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

'''Risk management''' is the identification, evaluation, and prioritization of [[risk]]s (defined in [[ISO 31000]] as ''the effect of uncertainty on objectives'') followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events&lt;ref name="Risk Management pg. 46"&gt;{{cite book|first=Douglas|last=Hubbard|title=The Failure of Risk Management: Why It's Broken and How to Fix It|page=46|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to maximize the realization of opportunities.

Risks can come from various sources including uncertainty in financial markets, threats from project failures (at any phase in design, development, production, or sustainment life-cycles), legal liabilities, credit risk, accidents, [[Act of God|natural causes and disasters]], deliberate attack from an adversary, or events of uncertain or unpredictable [[Root cause|root-cause]]. There are two types of events i.e. negative events can be classified as risks while positive events are classified as opportunities.  Several risk management [[Technical standard|standards]] have been developed including the [[Project Management Institute]], the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], actuarial societies, and ISO standards.&lt;ref name=voc&gt;{{cite book | author=ISO/IEC Guide 73:2009 | title= Risk management — Vocabulary | publisher=International Organization for Standardization | year=2009 | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=44651}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iso&gt;{{cite book | author=ISO/DIS 31000 | title= Risk management — Principles and guidelines on implementation | publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] | year=2009 | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=43170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods, definitions and goals vary widely according to whether the risk management method is in the context of project management, security, [[Risk analysis (engineering)|engineering]], [[Industrial Process|industrial processes]], financial portfolios, actuarial assessments, or public health and safety.

Strategies to manage threats (uncertainties with negative consequences) typically include avoiding the threat, reducing the negative effect or probability of the threat, transferring all or part of the threat to another party, and even retaining some or all of the potential or actual consequences of a particular threat, and the opposites for opportunities (uncertain future states with benefits).

Certain aspects of many of the risk management standards have come under criticism for having no measurable improvement on risk; whereas the confidence in estimates and decisions seem to increase.&lt;ref name="Risk Management pg. 46"/&gt; For example, one study found that one in six IT projects were "[[black swan theory|black swan]]s" with gigantic overruns (cost overruns averaged 200%, and schedule overruns 70%).&lt;ref name="Bent Flyvbjerg"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Flyvbjerg, Bent  |author2=Budzier, Alexander  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2011|title=Why Your IT Project May Be Riskier Than You Think|url=https://hbr.org/2011/09/why-your-it-project-may-be-riskier-than-you-think|journal= Harvard Business Review|volume=89|issue=9|pages=601–603}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}


A widely used vocabulary for risk management is defined by ''ISO Guide 73:2009'', "Risk management. Vocabulary."&lt;ref name=voc/&gt;

In ideal risk management, a prioritization process is followed whereby the risks with the greatest loss (or impact) and the greatest [[probability]] of occurring are handled first, and risks with lower probability of occurrence and lower loss are handled in descending order. In practice the process of assessing overall risk can be difficult, and balancing resources used to mitigate between risks with a high probability of occurrence but lower loss versus a risk with high loss but lower probability of occurrence can often be mishandled.

Intangible risk management identifies a new type of a risk that has a 100% probability of occurring but is ignored by the organization due to a lack of identification ability. For example, when deficient knowledge is applied to a situation, a [[knowledge]] risk materializes. Relationship risk appears when ineffective collaboration occurs. Process-engagement risk may be an issue when ineffective operational procedures are applied. These risks directly reduce the productivity of knowledge workers, decrease cost-effectiveness, profitability, service, quality, reputation, brand value, and earnings quality. Intangible risk management allows risk management to create immediate value from the identification and reduction of risks that reduce productivity.

Risk management also faces difficulties in allocating resources. This is the idea of [[opportunity cost]]. Resources spent on risk management could have been spent on more profitable activities. Again, ideal risk management minimizes spending (or manpower or other resources) and also minimizes the negative effects of risks.

According to the definition to the risk, the risk is the possibility that an event will occur and adversely affect the achievement of an objective. Therefore, risk itself has the uncertainty.  Risk management such as COSO ERM, can help managers have a good control for their risk.  Each company may have different internal control components, which leads to different outcomes. For example, the framework for ERM components includes Internal Environment, Objective Setting, Event Identification, Risk Assessment, Risk Response, Control Activities, Information and Communication, and Monitoring.

==Method==

For the most part, these methods consist of the following elements, performed, more or less, in the following order.

# identify, characterize [[threat]]s
# assess the [[vulnerability]] of critical assets to specific threats
# determine the [[risk]] (i.e. the expected likelihood and consequences of specific types of attacks on specific assets)
# identify ways to reduce those risks
# prioritize risk reduction measures

==Principles==

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) identifies the following principles of risk management:&lt;ref name="iso3100"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Committee Draft of ISO 31000 Risk management |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |url=http://www.nsai.ie/uploads/file/N047_Committee_Draft_of_ISO_31000.pdf |format=PDF |publication-date=2007-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325160441/http://www.nsai.ie/uploads/file/N047_Committee_Draft_of_ISO_31000.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risk management should:
* create [[value (economics)|value]] – resources expended to mitigate risk should be less than the consequence of inaction
* be an integral part of organizational processes
* be part of decision making process
* explicitly address uncertainty and assumptions
* be a systematic and structured process
* be based on the best available information
* be tailorable
* take human factors into account
* be transparent and inclusive
* be dynamic, iterative and responsive to change
* be capable of continual improvement and enhancement
* be continually or periodically re-assessed

==Process==
According to the standard [[ISO 31000]] "Risk management – Principles and guidelines on implementation,"&lt;ref name=iso /&gt; the process of risk management consists of several steps as follows:

===Establishing the context===
This involves:

#
#*the social scope of risk management
#*the identity and objectives of [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]]
#*the basis upon which risks will be evaluated, constraints.
#defining a framework for the activity and an agenda for identification
#developing an analysis of risks involved in the process
#mitigation or solution of risks using available technological, human and organizational resources

===Identification===
After establishing the context, the next step in the process of managing risk is to identify potential risks.  Risks are about events that, when triggered, cause problems or benefits. Hence, risk identification can start with the source of our problems and those of our competitors (benefit), or with the problem itself.
* Source analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.madrid.org/cs/StaticFiles/Emprendedores/Analisis_Riesgos/pages/pdf/metodologia/3IdentificaciondelosRiesgos_en.pdf|title=Risk Identification|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Comunidad de Madrid|page=3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Risk sources may be internal or external to the system that is the target of risk management (use mitigation instead of management since by its own definition risk deals with factors of decision-making that cannot be managed).
Examples of risk sources are: stakeholders of a project, employees of a company or the weather over an airport.
* Problem analysis{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} – Risks are related to identified threats. For example: the threat of losing money, the threat of abuse of confidential information or the threat of human errors, accidents and casualties. The threats may exist with various entities, most important with shareholders, customers and legislative bodies such as the government.
When either source or problem is known, the events that a source may trigger or the events that can lead to a problem can be investigated. For example: stakeholders withdrawing during a project may endanger funding of the project; confidential information may be stolen by employees even within a closed network; lightning striking an aircraft during takeoff may make all people on board immediate casualties.

The chosen method of identifying risks may depend on culture, industry practice and compliance. The identification methods are formed by templates or the development of templates for identifying source, problem or event. Common risk identification methods are:
* Objectives-based risk identification {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} – Organizations and project teams have objectives. Any event that may endanger achieving an objective partly or completely is identified as risk.
* Scenario-based risk identification – In [[scenario analysis]] different scenarios are created. The scenarios may be the alternative ways to achieve an objective, or an analysis of the interaction of forces in, for example, a market or battle. Any event that triggers an undesired scenario alternative is identified as risk – see [[Futures Studies]] for methodology used by [[Futurists]].
* Taxonomy-based risk identification – The taxonomy in taxonomy-based risk identification is a breakdown of possible risk sources. Based on the taxonomy and knowledge of best practices, a questionnaire is compiled. The answers to the questions reveal risks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/93tr006.cfm CMU/SEI-93-TR-6 Taxonomy-based risk identification in software industry]. Sei.cmu.edu. Retrieved on 2012-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Common-risk checking &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fsa.go.jp/p_fsa/news/newse/ne_023/03.pdf|title=Risk Management Systems Checklist (Common Items)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.fsa.go.jpn|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; – In several industries, lists with known risks are available. Each risk in the list can be checked for application to a particular situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cve.mitre.org Common Vulnerability and Exposures list]. Cve.mitre.org. Retrieved on 2012-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Risk charting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crockford|first=Neil|title=An Introduction to Risk Management|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Woodhead-Faulkner|edition=2|year=1986|page=18|isbn=0-85941-332-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; – This method combines the above approaches by listing resources at risk, threats to those resources, modifying factors which may increase or decrease the risk and consequences it is wished to avoid. Creating a [[Risk matrix|matrix]] under these headings enables a variety of approaches. One can begin with resources and consider the threats they are exposed to and the consequences of each.   Alternatively one can start with the threats and examine which resources they would affect, or one can begin with the consequences and determine which combination of threats and resources would be involved to bring them about.

===Assessment===
{{Main article|Risk assessment}}
Once risks have been identified, they must then be assessed as to their potential severity of impact (generally a negative impact, such as damage or loss) and to the probability of occurrence. These quantities can be either simple to measure, in the case of the value of a lost building, or impossible to know for sure in the case of an unlikely event, the probability of occurrence of which is unknown. Therefore, in the assessment process it is critical to make the best educated decisions in order to properly prioritize the implementation of the [[risk management plan]].

Even a short-term positive improvement can have long-term negative impacts.  Take the "turnpike" example. A highway is widened to allow more traffic. More traffic capacity leads to greater development in the areas surrounding the improved traffic capacity.   Over time, traffic thereby increases to fill available capacity. Turnpikes thereby need to be expanded in a seemingly endless cycles. There are many other engineering examples where expanded capacity (to do any function) is soon filled by increased demand. Since expansion comes at a cost, the resulting growth could become unsustainable without forecasting and management.

The fundamental difficulty in risk assessment is determining the rate of occurrence since statistical information is not available on all kinds of past incidents and is particularly scanty in the case of catastrophic events, simply because of their infrequency. Furthermore, evaluating the severity of the consequences (impact) is often quite difficult for intangible assets. Asset valuation is another question that needs to be addressed. Thus, best educated opinions and available statistics are the primary sources of information. Nevertheless, risk assessment should produce such information for senior executives of the organization that the primary risks are easy to understand and that the risk management decisions may be prioritized within overall company goals. Thus, there have been several theories and attempts to quantify risks. Numerous different risk formulae exist, but perhaps the most widely accepted formula for risk quantification is: "Rate (or probability) of occurrence multiplied by the impact of the event equals risk magnitude."{{vague|section|date=January 2016}}

==Risk options==
Risk mitigation measures are usually formulated according to one or more of the following major risk options, which are:

#Design a new business process with adequate built-in risk control and containment measures from the start.
#Periodically re-assess risks that are accepted in ongoing processes as a normal feature of business operations and modify mitigation measures.
#Transfer risks to an external agency (e.g. an insurance company)
#Avoid risks altogether (e.g. by closing down a particular high-risk business area)

Later research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CRISC Exam Questions|url=https://www.dumpsbook.com/Exam/CRISC|accessdate= 23 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that the financial benefits of risk management are less dependent on the formula used but are more dependent on the frequency and how risk assessment is performed.

In business it is imperative to be able to present the findings of risk assessments in financial, market, or schedule terms. Robert Courtney Jr. (IBM, 1970) proposed a formula for presenting risks in financial terms. The Courtney formula was accepted as the official risk analysis method for the US governmental agencies. The formula proposes calculation of ALE (annualized loss expectancy) and compares the expected loss value to the security control implementation costs ([[cost-benefit analysis]]).

===Potential risk treatments===
Once risks have been identified and assessed, all techniques to manage the risk fall into one or more of these four major categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dorfman|first=Mark S. |title=Introduction to Risk Management and Insurance|edition=9 |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-13-224227-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Avoidance (eliminate, withdraw from or not become involved)
* Reduction (optimize – mitigate)
* Sharing (transfer – outsource or insure)
* Retention (accept and budget)

Ideal use of these [[risk control strategies]] may not be possible.  Some of them may involve trade-offs that are not acceptable to the organization or person making the risk management decisions. Another source, from the US Department of Defense (see link), [[Defense Acquisition University]], calls these categories ACAT, for Avoid, Control, Accept, or Transfer.  This use of the ACAT acronym is reminiscent of another ACAT (for Acquisition Category) used in US Defense industry procurements, in which Risk Management figures prominently in decision making and planning.

====Risk avoidance====
This includes not performing an activity that could carry risk.  An example would be not buying a [[Real property|property]] or business in order to not take on the [[legal liability]] that comes with it.  Another would be not flying in order not to take the risk that the [[airplane]] were to be [[Aircraft hijacking|hijack]]ed.  Avoidance may seem the answer to all risks, but avoiding risks also means losing out on the potential gain that accepting (retaining) the risk may have allowed.  Not entering a business to avoid the risk of loss also avoids the possibility of earning profits.  Increasing risk regulation in hospitals has led to avoidance of treating higher risk conditions, in favor of patients presenting with lower risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry|author2=Fischer, Michael D. |title=Reactivity and reactions to regulatory transparency in medicine, psychotherapy and counseling|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=1 February 2012|volume=74|issue=3|pages=289–296|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.035|pmid=22104085|url=http://eureka.sbs.ox.ac.uk/4314/1/McGivern_G___Fischer_M_D__%282012%29_Reactivity_and_Reactions_to_Regulatory_Transparency_in_Medicine_Psychotherapy_and_Counselling_%28Authors%27_version%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Risk reduction====
Risk reduction or "optimization" involves reducing the severity of the loss or the likelihood of the loss from occurring.  For example, [[Fire sprinkler|sprinkler]]s are designed to put out a [[fire]] to reduce the risk of loss by fire.  This method may cause a greater loss by water damage and therefore may not be suitable.  [[Halomethane|Halon]] fire suppression systems may mitigate that risk, but the cost may be prohibitive as a [[strategy]].

Acknowledging that risks can be positive or negative, optimizing risks means finding a balance between negative risk and the benefit of the operation or activity; and between risk reduction and effort applied. By an offshore drilling contractor effectively applying [[Health, Safety and Environment]] (HSE) management in its organization, it can optimize risk to achieve levels of [[residual risk]] that are tolerable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iadc.org/ebookstore/ebook-iadc-hse-case-guidelines-for-mobile-offshore-drilling-units/ IADC HSE Case Guidelines for Mobile Offshore Drilling Units] 3.2, section 4.7&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern software development methodologies reduce risk by developing and delivering software incrementally.  Early methodologies suffered from the fact that they only delivered software in the final phase of development; any problems encountered in earlier phases meant costly rework and often jeopardized the whole project.  By developing in iterations, software projects can limit effort wasted to a single iteration.

[[Outsourcing]] could be an example of risk sharing strategy if the outsourcer can demonstrate higher capability at managing or reducing risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roehrig|first=P|year=2006|url=http://www.btquarterly.com/?mc=bet-governance&amp;page=ss-viewresearch|title=Bet On Governance To Manage Outsourcing Risk|journal=Business Trends Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a company may outsource only its software development, the manufacturing of hard goods, or customer support needs to another company, while handling the business management itself.  This way, the company can concentrate more on business development without having to worry as much about the manufacturing process, managing the development team, or finding a physical location for a center.

====Risk sharing====
Briefly defined as "sharing with another party the burden of loss or the benefit of gain, from a risk, and the measures to reduce a risk."

The term of 'risk transfer' is often used in place of risk sharing in the mistaken belief that you can transfer a risk to a third party through insurance or outsourcing. In practice if the insurance company or contractor go bankrupt or end up in court, the original risk is likely to still revert to the first party. As such in the terminology of practitioners and scholars alike, the purchase of an insurance contract is often described as a "transfer of risk." However, technically speaking, the buyer of the contract generally retains legal responsibility for the losses "transferred", meaning that insurance may be described more accurately as a post-event compensatory mechanism. For example, a personal injuries insurance policy does not transfer the risk of a car accident to the insurance company. The risk still lies with the policy holder namely the person who has been in the accident. The insurance policy simply provides that if an accident (the event) occurs involving the policy holder then some compensation may be payable to the policy holder that is commensurate with the suffering/damage.

Some ways of managing risk fall into multiple categories. Risk retention pools are technically retaining the risk for the group, but spreading it over the whole group involves transfer among individual members of the group. This is different from traditional insurance, in that no premium is exchanged between members of the group up front, but instead losses are assessed to all members of the group.

====Risk retention====
Risk retention involves accepting the loss, or benefit of gain, from a risk when the incident occurs.  True [[self-insurance]] falls in this category.  Risk retention is a viable strategy for small risks where the cost of insuring against the risk would be greater over time than the total losses sustained. All risks that are not avoided or transferred are retained by default.  This includes risks that are so large or catastrophic that either they cannot be insured against or the premiums would be infeasible.  [[War]] is an example since most property and risks are not insured against war, so the loss attributed to war is retained by the insured.  Also any amounts of potential loss (risk) over the amount insured is retained risk.  This may also be acceptable if the chance of a very large loss is small or if the cost to insure for greater coverage amounts is so great that it would hinder the goals of the organization too much.

===Risk management plan===
{{main|Risk management plan}}

Select appropriate controls or countermeasures to mitigate each risk. Risk mitigation needs to be approved by the appropriate level of management. For instance, a risk concerning the image of the organization should have top management decision behind it whereas IT management would have the authority to decide on computer virus risks.

The risk management plan should propose applicable and effective security controls for managing the risks. For example, an observed high risk of computer viruses could be mitigated by acquiring and implementing antivirus software. A good risk management plan should contain a schedule for control implementation and responsible persons for those actions.

According to [[ISO/IEC 27001]], the stage immediately after completion of the [[risk assessment]] phase consists of preparing a Risk Treatment Plan, which should document the decisions about how each of the identified risks should be handled.  Mitigation of risks often means selection of [[security controls]], which should be documented in a Statement of Applicability, which identifies which particular control objectives and controls from the 
standard have been selected, and why.

===Implementation===
Implementation follows all of the planned methods for mitigating the effect of the risks.  Purchase insurance policies for the risks that it has been decided to transferred to an insurer, avoid all risks that can be avoided without sacrificing the entity's goals, reduce others, and retain the rest.

===Review and evaluation of the plan===
Initial risk management plans will never be perfect. Practice, experience, and actual loss results will necessitate changes in the plan and contribute information to allow possible different decisions to be made in dealing with the risks being faced.

[[Risk analysis (business)|Risk analysis]] results and management plans should be updated periodically. There are two primary reasons for this: 
# to evaluate whether the previously selected security controls are still applicable and effective
# to evaluate the possible risk level changes in the business environment. For example, information risks are a good example of rapidly changing business environment.

==Limitations==
Prioritizing the ''risk management processes'' too highly could keep an organization from ever completing a project or even getting started.  This is especially true if other work is suspended until the risk management process is considered complete.

It is also important to keep in mind the distinction between risk and [[uncertainty]]. Risk can be measured by impacts × probability.

If risks are improperly assessed and prioritized, time can be wasted in dealing with risk of losses that are not likely to occur.  Spending too much time assessing and managing unlikely risks can divert resources that could be used more profitably.  Unlikely events do occur but if the risk is unlikely enough to occur it may be better to simply retain the risk and deal with the result if the loss does in fact occur. Qualitative risk assessment is subjective and lacks consistency. The primary justification for a formal risk assessment process is legal and bureaucratic.

==Areas==
As applied to [[corporate finance]], ''risk management'' is the technique for measuring, monitoring and controlling the financial or [[operational risk]] on a firm's [[balance sheet]], a traditional measure is the [[value at risk]] (VaR), but there also other measures like [[profit at risk]] (PaR) or [[margin at risk]]. The [[Basel II]] framework breaks risks into [[market risk]] (price risk), [[credit risk]] and operational risk and also specifies methods for calculating [[capital requirement]]s for each of these components.

In Information Technology, Risk management includes "Incident Handling", an action plan for dealing with intrusions, cyber-theft, denial of service, fire, floods, and other security-related events. According to the [[SANS Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sans.org/security-resources/glossary-of-terms/ SANS Glossary of Security Terms] Retrieved on 2016-11-13&lt;/ref&gt; it is a six step process: Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned.

===Enterprise===
{{Main article|Enterprise Risk Management}}
In enterprise risk management, a risk is defined as a possible event or circumstance that can have negative influences on the enterprise in question.  Its impact can be on the very existence, the resources (human and capital), the products and services, or the customers of the enterprise, as well as external impacts on society, markets, or the environment.  In a financial institution, enterprise risk management is normally thought of as the combination of credit risk, [[interest rate risk]] or [[asset liability management]], liquidity risk, market risk, and operational risk.

In the more general case, every probable risk can have a pre-formulated plan to deal with its possible consequences (to ensure ''contingency'' if the risk becomes a ''liability'').

From the information above and the average cost per employee over time, or [[cost accrual ratio]], a project manager can estimate:

* the cost associated with the risk if it arises, estimated by multiplying employee costs per unit time by the estimated time lost (''cost impact'', ''C'' where ''C = cost accrual ratio * S''){{abbreviations|date=September 2016}}.
* the probable increase in time associated with a risk (''schedule variance due to risk'', ''Rs'' where Rs = P * S):
** Sorting on this value puts the highest risks to the schedule first. This is intended to cause the greatest risks to the project to be attempted first so that risk is minimized as quickly as possible.
** This is slightly misleading as ''schedule variances'' with a large P and small S and vice versa are not equivalent. (The risk of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] sinking vs. the passengers' meals being served at slightly the wrong time).
* the probable increase in cost associated with a risk (''cost variance due to risk'', ''Rc'' where Rc = P*C = P*CAR*S = P*S*CAR)
** sorting on this value puts the highest risks to the budget first.
** see concerns about ''schedule variance'' as this is a function of it, as illustrated in the equation above.

Risk in a [[project]] or [[business process|process]] can be due either to [[Special Cause Variation]] or [[Common Cause Variation]] and requires appropriate treatment.  That is to re-iterate the concern about extremal cases not being equivalent in the list immediately above.

===Enterprise Security===
ESRM is a security program management approach that links security activities to an enterprise's mission and business goals through risk management methods. The security leader's role in ESRM is to manage risks of harm to enterprise assets in partnership with the business leaders whose assets are exposed to those risks. ESRM involves educating business leaders on the realistic impacts of identified risks, presenting potential strategies to mitigate those impacts, then enacting the option chosen by the business in line with accepted levels of business risk tolerance&lt;ref&gt;ASIS https://www.asisonline.org/publications--resources/news/blog/esrm-an-enduring-security-risk-model/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical device===
For medical devices, risk management is a process for identifying, evaluating and mitigating risks associated with harm to people and damage to property or the environment. Risk management is an integral part of medical device design and development, production processes and evaluation of field experience, and is applicable to all types of medical devices. The evidence of its application is required by most regulatory bodies such as the [[Food and Drug Administration|US FDA]]. The management of risks for medical devices is described by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in ISO 14971:2007, Medical Devices—The application of risk management to medical devices, a product safety standard. The standard provides a process framework and associated requirements for management responsibilities, risk analysis and evaluation, risk controls and lifecycle risk management.

The European version of the risk management standard was updated in 2009 and again in 2012 to refer to the Medical Devices Directive (MDD) and Active Implantable Medical Device Directive (AIMDD) revision in 2007, as well as the In Vitro Medical Device Directive (IVDD). The requirements of EN 14971:2012 are nearly identical to ISO 14971:2007. The differences include three "(informative)" Z Annexes that refer to the new MDD, AIMDD, and IVDD.  These annexes indicate content deviations that include the requirement for risks to be reduced ''as far as possible'', and the requirement that risks be mitigated by design and not by labeling on the medical device (i.e., labeling can no longer be used to mitigate risk).

Typical risk analysis and evaluation techniques adopted by the medical device industry include [[hazard analysis]], [[fault tree analysis]] (FTA), [[failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA), hazard and operability study ([[HAZOP]]), and risk traceability analysis for ensuring risk controls are implemented and effective (i.e. tracking risks identified to product requirements, design specifications, verification and validation results etc.). FTA analysis requires diagramming software. FMEA analysis can be done using a [[spreadsheet]] program. There are also integrated medical device risk management solutions.

Through a [http://www.fda.gov/medicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm206153.htm draft guidance], the FDA has introduced another method named "Safety Assurance Case" for medical device safety assurance analysis. The safety assurance case is structured argument reasoning about systems appropriate for scientists and engineers, supported by a body of evidence, that provides a compelling, comprehensible and valid case that a system is safe for a given application in a given environment. With the guidance, a safety assurance case is expected for safety critical devices (e.g. infusion devices) as part of the pre-market clearance submission, e.g. 510(k). In 2013, the FDA introduced another draft guidance expecting medical device manufacturers to submit cybersecurity risk analysis information.

===Project management===
{{Main article| project risk management}}
Project risk management must be considered at the different phases of acquisition.  In the beginning of a project, the advancement of technical developments, or threats presented by a competitor's projects, may cause a risk or threat assessment and subsequent evaluation of alternatives (see [[Analysis of Alternatives]]). Once a decision is made, and the project begun, more familiar project management applications can be used:&lt;ref&gt;Lev Virine and Michael Trumper. ''Project Decisions: The Art and Science''.

What Is Risk Management?  http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/what-is-project-risk-management&lt;/ref&gt;]]

* Planning how risk will be managed in the particular project.  Plans should include risk management tasks, responsibilities, activities and budget.
* Assigning a risk officer – a team member other than a project manager who is responsible for foreseeing potential project problems.  Typical characteristic of risk officer is a healthy skepticism.
* Maintaining live project risk database.  Each risk should have the following attributes: opening date, title, short description, probability and importance.  Optionally a risk may have an assigned person responsible for its resolution and a date by which the risk must be resolved.
* Creating anonymous risk reporting channel.  Each team member should have the possibility to report risks that he/she foresees in the project.
* Preparing mitigation plans for risks that are chosen to be mitigated.  The purpose of the mitigation plan is to describe how this particular risk will be handled – what, when, by whom and how will it be done to avoid it or minimize consequences if it becomes a liability.
* Summarizing planned and faced risks, effectiveness of mitigation activities, and effort spent for the risk management.

===Megaprojects (infrastructure)===
[[Megaproject]]s (sometimes also called "major programs") are large-scale investment projects, typically costing more than $1 billion per project. Megaprojects include major bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, airports, seaports, power plants, dams, wastewater projects, coastal flood protection schemes, oil and natural gas extraction projects, public buildings, information technology systems, aerospace projects, and defense systems. Megaprojects have been shown to be particularly risky in terms of finance, safety, and social and environmental impacts.&lt;ref name="Megaprojects and Risk"&gt;{{cite book|first=Bent|last=Flyvbjerg|title=Megaprojects and Risk: An Anatomy of Ambition|publisher=Cambridge University Press|ISBN=0521804205|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk management is therefore particularly pertinent for megaprojects and special methods and special education have been developed for such risk management.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford BT Centre for Major Programme Management]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural disasters===
It is important to assess risk in regard to natural disasters like [[Flood risk assessment|floods]], [[seismic hazard|earthquakes]], and so on. Outcomes of natural disaster risk assessment are valuable when considering future repair costs, business interruption losses and other downtime, effects on the environment, insurance costs, and the proposed costs of reducing the risk.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Alan.

===Wilderness===

The management of risks to persons and property in [[Wilderness|wilderness]] and remote natural areas has developed with increases in outdoor recreation participation and decreased social tolerance for loss.  Organizations providing commercial wilderness experiences can now align with national and international consensus standards for training and equipment such as [[American_National_Standards_Institute|ANSI]]/NASBLA 101-2017 (boating)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American National Standard ANSI/NASBLA 101-2017: Basic Boating Knowledge--Human Propelled|url= https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.americancanoe.org/resource/resmgr/spp-documents/ANSI_NASBLA_101-2017_Human_P.pdf|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[International_Climbing_and_Mountaineering_Federation|UIAA]] 152 (ice climbing tools)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UIAA Standard 152: Ice Tools|url= https://www.theuiaa.org/documents/safety-standards/152_IceTools_UIAA2018.pdf|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[European_Committee_for_Standardization|European Norm]] 13089:2015 + A1:2015 (mountaineering equipment)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EN 13089 Mountaineering equipment - Ice-tools - Safety requirements and test methods (includes Amendment A1:2015)|url= https://www.en-standard.eu/din-en-13089-mountaineering-equipment-ice-tools-safety-requirements-and-test-methods-includes-amendment-a1-2015/|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish Standard I.S.EN 13089:2011+A1:2015 Mountaineering equipment - Ice-tools - Safety requirements and test methods|url= https://infostore.saiglobal.com/preview/is/en/2011/i.s.en13089-2011%2Ba1-2015.pdf?sku=1458668|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Information technology===
{{Main article|IT risk management}}
[[IT risk]] is a risk related to information technology. This is a relatively new term due to an increasing awareness that [[information security]] is simply one facet of a multitude of risks that are relevant to IT and the real world processes it supports.

[[ISACA]]'s ''[[Risk IT]]'' framework ties IT risk to [[enterprise risk management]].

CIS RAM provides a method to design and evaluate the implementation of the CIS Controls™.

===Petroleum and natural gas===
For the offshore oil and gas industry, operational risk management is regulated by the [[safety case]] regime in many countries. Hazard identification and risk assessment tools and techniques are described in the international standard ISO 17776:2000, and organisations such as the IADC ([[International Association of Drilling Contractors]]) publish guidelines for [[Health, Safety and Environment]] (HSE) Case development which are based on the ISO standard. Further, diagrammatic representations of hazardous events are often expected by governmental regulators as part of risk management in safety case submissions; these are known as '''[[bow-tie diagram]]s''' (see [[Network theory in risk assessment]]). The technique is also used by organisations and regulators in mining, aviation, health, defence, industrial and finance.

===Pharmaceutical sector===
The principles and tools for quality risk management are increasingly being applied to different aspects of pharmaceutical quality systems. These aspects include development, manufacturing, distribution, inspection, and submission/review processes throughout the lifecycle of drug substances, drug products, biological and biotechnological products (including the use of raw materials, solvents, excipients, packaging and labeling materials in drug products, biological and biotechnological products). Risk management is also applied to the assessment of [http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/articles/2011/126.html microbiological contamination] in relation to pharmaceutical products and cleanroom manufacturing environments.&lt;ref name=Sandle&gt;{{cite book | author = Saghee M, Sandle T, Tidswell E (editors) | title = Microbiology and Sterility Assurance in Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices | edition = 1st | publisher = Business Horizons | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-8190646741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk communication==
Risk communication is a complex cross-disciplinary academic field related to [[Value system|core values]] of the targeted audiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.navy.mil/sites/nmcphc/Documents/policy-and-instruction/nmcphc-risk-communications-primer.pdf Risk Communication Primer—Tools and Techniques]. Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.start.umd.edu/sites/default/files/files/publications/UnderstandingRiskCommunicationTheory.pdf Understanding Risk Communication Theory: A Guide for Emergency Managers and Communicators]. Report to Human Factors/Behavioral Sciences Division, Science and Technology Directorate,  U.S. Department of Homeland Security (May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Problems for risk communicators involve how to reach the intended audience, how to make the risk comprehensible and relatable to other risks, how to pay appropriate respect to the audience's values related to the risk, how to predict the audience's response to the communication, etc. A main goal of risk communication is to improve collective and individual decision making. Risk communication is somewhat related to [[crisis communication]]. Some experts coincide that risk is not only enrooted in the communication process but also it cannot be dissociated from the use of language. Though each culture develops its own fears and risks, these construes apply only by the hosting culture.

[[File:RicciocarposNatans8.jpg|thumb|Rosette growth form of the [[liverwort]] ''[[Ricciocarpos natans]]''.]]
In botany, a '''rosette''' is a circular arrangement of leaves or of structures resembling leaves.

In flowering plants, rosettes usually sit near the soil, their structure is an example of a [[Aerial stem modification|modified stem]] in which the [[internode (botany)|internode]] gaps between the leaves do not expand, so that all the leaves remain clustered tightly together and at a similar height.

In [[bryophyte]]s and [[algae]], a rosette results from the repeated branching of the [[thallus]] as the plant grows, resulting in a circular outline.

==Taxonomies==
Many plant [[family (taxonomy)|families]] have varieties with rosette morphology; they are particularly common in [[Asteraceae]] (such as [[dandelion]]s), [[Brassicaceae]] (such as [[cabbage]]), and [[Bromeliaceae]]. The fern, ''[[Blechnum fluviatile]]'' or [[New Zealand]] Water Fern (''kiwikiwi'') is a rosette plant.

==Function in flowering plants==
Often, rosettes form in [[Perennial plant|perennial]] plants whose upper foliage dies back with the remaining vegetation protecting the plant. Another form occurs when [[Internode (botany)|internodes]] along a stem are shortened, bringing the leaves closer together, as in [[lettuce]] and [[dandelion]] and some [[succulent]]s.&lt;ref name="biologie.uni-hamburg.de"&gt;[http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e02/02c.htm Botany online: Features of Flowering Plants - Leaves&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514141753/http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e02/02c.htm |date=2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (When plants such as lettuce grow too quickly, the stem lengthens instead, a condition known as [[Bolting (horticulture)|bolting]].) In yet other forms, the rosette persists at the base of the plant (such as the dandelion), and there is a [[taproot]].

===Protection===
[[File:Agave americana4.jpg|right|thumb|Rosette of leaves of ''[[Agave americana]]'']]
Part of the protective function of a rosette like the dandelion is that it is hard to pull from the ground; the leaves come away easily while the taproot is left intact.

Another kind of protection is provided by the ''caulescent rosette'' which is part of the growth form of the giant genus ''[[Espeletia]]'' in South America, which has a well-developed stem above the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evoandes.net/espeletiapage.html shows many images] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705233052/http://www.evoandes.net/espeletiapage.html |date=2008-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In tropical alpine environments a wide variety of plants in different plant families and different parts of the world have evolved this [[growth form]] characterized by evergreen rosettes growing above [[marcescent]] leaves. Examples where this arrangement has been confirmed to improve survival, help water balance, or protect the plant from cold injury are ''[[Espeletia]] schultzii'' and ''Espeletia timotensis'', both from the [[Andes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=688033&amp;q=marcescent+leaves+&amp;uid=788491162&amp;setcookie=yes Goldstein, G. and Meinzer, F.1983. Influence of insulating dead leaves and low temperatures on water balance in an Andean giant rosette plant. ''Plant, Cell &amp; Environment'' 6: 649-656.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2388171 Smith, Alan P.1979. Function of dead leaves in ''Espeletia schultzii'' (Compositae), and Andean caulescent rosette species. ''Biotropica'' 11: 43-47.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
The rosette form is the structure, the relationship of the parts, and the variations within it, as shown in the following study from a [[herbarium]]:

*''[[Dryas octopetala]]'' (White Dryas, Rosaceae) has a leaf rosette of leaf blades with a short [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]], slim, egg-shaped leaves with cordate bases with clearly and regularly toothed margins, and single flowers on usually long [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]]s or stalks, two to four centimetres across. The flowers have seven to nine, often even more, white egg-shaped petals. The sepals are [[lanceolate]].&lt;ref name=whorl&gt;[http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e02/rosetten.htm Botany online: Features of flowering Plants - Rosettes - Whorls&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Silene nutans]]'' (Nottingham Catchfly, Caryophyllaceae) shows ensiform-lanceolate leaves. The slightly rosette-like ground leaves are bigger and of different shape than the sparse, [[opposite leaves]] on the stem.&lt;ref name=whorl /&gt; This is explained in that side shoots with greatly prolonged internodes may spring from rosettes. They have one or more flowers at their tip, like the [[Primula vulgaris|primrose]]. Especially in biennial plants, the main shoot can, too, grow with prolonged internodes and even branch. It is not unusual that the leaves of the rosette and those of the shoot differ in shape.&lt;ref name="biologie.uni-hamburg.de"/&gt;

As form then, "rosette" is used to describe plants that perpetually grow as a rosette and the immature stage of plants such as some ferns.

A '''safety instrumented system''' ('''SIS''') consists of an engineered set of hardware and software controls which are especially used on critical process systems.

== Examples ==
Safety instrumented systems are most often used in process (e.g., refineries, chemical, nuclear) facilities to provide protection such as:
* High fuel gas pressure initiates action to close the main fuel gas valve.
* High reactor temperature initiates action to open cooling media valve.
* High distillation column pressure initiates action to open a pressure vent valve.

==Critical process systems==
A critical process system can be identified as one which, once running and an operational problem occurs, may need to be put into a "Safe State" to avoid adverse Safety, Health and Environmental(SH&amp;E) consequences. A Safe State is a process condition, whether the process is operating or shutdown, such that a hazardous SH&amp;E event cannot occur.  

Examples of critical processes have been common since the beginning of the Industrial Age. One of the more well known critical processes is the operation of a steam boiler. Critical parts of the process would include the lighting of the burners, controlling the level of water in the drum, and controlling the steam pressure.

== Requirement specification ==
What a SIS shall do (''the functional requirements'') and how well it must perform (''the safety integrity requirements'') may be determined from [[Hazard and operability study|Hazard and operability studies]] (HAZOP), layers of protection analysis (LOPA), risk graphs, and so on. All techniques are mentioned in IEC 61511 and IEC 61508. During SIS design, construction, installation, and operation, it is necessary to verify that these requirements are met. The functional requirements may be verified by design reviews, such as failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA) and various types of testing, for example factory acceptance testing, site acceptance testing, and regular functional testing.

The safety integrity requirements may be verified by reliability analysis. For SIS that operates on demand, it is often the probability of failure on demand (PFD) that is calculated. In the design phase, the PFD may be calculated using generic reliability data, for example from OREDA. Later on, the initial PFD estimates may be updated with field experience from the specific plant in question.

It is not possible to address all factors that affect SIS reliability through reliability calculations. It is therefore also necessary to have adequate measures in place (e.g., procedures and competence) to avoid, reveal, and correct SIS related failures.

=== Hazard identification ===
A formal process of hazard identification is performed by the project team engineers and other experts at the completion of the engineering design phase of each section of the process, known as a Unit of Operation. This team performs a systematic, rigorous, procedural review of each point of possible hazard, or "node", in the completed engineering design. This review and its resulting documentation is called a HAZOP study. A HAZOP study typically reveals hazardous scenarios which require further risk mitigating measures which are to be achieved by SIFs. Via a Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) or some other approved method, [[Integrity Level | Integrity Levels (IL)]] are defined for the SIFs in their respective scenarios.  The Integrity Levels may be categorised as Safety Integrity Level (SIL) or Environmental Integrity Level (EIL). Based on HAZOP study recommendations and the IL rating of the SIFs; the engineering (including the BPCS and the SIF designs) for each unit operation is finalized.

== System design ==
A SIS is engineered to perform "specific control functions" to failsafe or maintain safe operation of a process when unacceptable or dangerous conditions occur.  Safety Instrumented Systems must be independent from all other [[control system]]s that control the same equipment in order to ensure SIS functionality is not compromised. SIS is composed of the same types of control elements (including [[sensors]], [[logic solver | logic solvers]], [[actuators]] and other control equipment) as a Basic [[Process Control]] System (BPCS). However, all of the control elements in an SIS are dedicated solely to the proper functioning of the SIS.

The specific control functions performed by an SIS are called ''Safety Instrumented Functions'' (SIF). They are implemented as part of an overall [[risk management|risk reduction]] strategy which is intended to eliminate the likelihood of a previously identified SH&amp;E event that could range from minor equipment damage up to an event involving an uncontrolled catastrophic release of energy and/or materials.

The safe state must be achieved in a timely manner or within the "process safety time".

=== Equipment ===
The correct operation of an SIS requires a series of equipment to function properly.  It must have sensors capable of detecting abnormal operating conditions, such as high flow, low level, or incorrect valve positioning. A logic solver is required to receive the sensor input signal(s), make appropriate decisions based on the nature of the signal(s), and change its outputs according to user-defined logic. The logic solver may use electrical, electronic or programmable electronic equipment, such as [[relay]]s, trip [[amplifier]]s, or [[programmable logic controller]]s. Next, the change of the logic solver output(s) results in the final element(s) taking action on the process (e.g. closing a valve) to bring it to a safe state. Support systems, such as power, instrument air, and communications, are generally required for SIS operation. The support systems should be designed to provide the required integrity and [[Reliability engineering|reliability]].

== International standards ==
International standard [[IEC 61511]] was published in 2003 to provide guidance to end-users on the application of Safety Instrumented Systems in the process industries. This standard is based on [[IEC 61508]], a generic standard for design, construction, and operation of electrical/electronic/programmable electronic systems. Other industry sectors may also have standards that are based on IEC 61508, such as [[IEC 62061]] (machinery systems), [[IEC 62425]] (for railway signaling systems), IEC 61513 (for nuclear systems), and [[ISO 26262]] (for road vehicles, currently a draft international standard).

==Life==

Sara Baartman, called "Saartjie" (the diminutive form), was born in the 1770s likely in the Camdeboo valley in the eastern part of the [[Cape Colony]]. It is commonly thought she was born in the Gamtoos valley, but she only moved there with her family years after her birth.&lt;ref name="crais_scully" /&gt; In 1810, she went to England with her employer, a free black man (a Cape designation for someone of slave descent) called Hendrik Cesars, and William Dunlop, an English doctor who worked at the Cape slave lodge.&lt;ref name="crais_scully" /&gt; They sought to show her for money on the London stage. Sara Baartman spent four years on stage in England and Ireland. Early on, her treatment on the [[Piccadilly]] stage caught the attention of British abolitionists, who argued that her performance was indecent and that she was being forced to perform against her will. Ultimately, the court ruled in favour of her exhibition after Dunlop produced a contract made between himself and Baartman. It is doubtful that this contract was valid: it was probably produced for the purposes of the trial.&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt; Cesars left the show and Dunlop continued to display Baartman in country fairs. Baartman also moved to [[Manchester]], where she was baptized as Sarah Bartmann. In 1814, after Dunlop's death, a man called Henry Taylor brought Baartman to Paris. He sold her to an animal trainer, S. Reaux, who made her amuse onlookers who frequented the [[Palais-Royal]]. [[Georges Cuvier]], founder and professor of comparative anatomy at the [[Museum of Natural History]], examined Baartman as he searched for proof of a so-called missing link between animals and human beings. Baartman's body was exploited for scientific racism.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} 

Baartman lived in poverty, and died in Paris of an undetermined inflammatory disease in December 1815. After her death, Cuvier [[dissection|dissected]] her body, and displayed her remains. For more than a century and a half, visitors to the [[Musée de l'Homme|''Museum of Man'']] in Paris could view her brain, skeleton and genitalia as well as a plaster cast of her body.  Her remains were returned to South Africa in 2002 and she was buried in the Eastern Cape on South Africa's [[National Women's Day]].&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Qureshi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Qureshi|first=Sadiah|title=Displaying Sara Baartman, the 'Venus Hottentot'|journal=History of Science|date=June 2004|volume=42|pages=233–257|issue=136|doi=10.1177/007327530404200204|quote=The woman ... is now called Sara Baartman. Unfortunately, no record of her original name exists and she is better known by her epithet, the Hottentot Venus', to her contemporaries, present-day historians, and political activists.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early life in South Africa ===
Sara Baartman was born to a [[Khoikhoi]] family in the vicinity of the Camdeboo in what is now the [[Eastern Cape]] of South Africa, on land taken over by Dutch farmers.&lt;ref name="crais_scully" /&gt;&lt;ref name=atrest/&gt; Her father was killed by Bushmen while driving cattle.&lt;ref&gt;In her testimony to the Court of King's Bench via a Dutch interpreter Baartman said: 'Her father was a drover of cattle, and in going up the country was killed by the Bushmen.' ''The Times'' (London, England), 29 November 1810, p. 3: Law Report. Court of King's Bench.&lt;/ref&gt; Saartjie is the [[diminutive]] form of Sara; in Cape Dutch the use of the diminutive form commonly indicated familiarity, endearment or contempt. Her birth name is unknown.&lt;ref name=Qureshi /&gt;

Baartman spent her childhood and teenage years on settler farms. She went through puberty rites, and kept the small tortoise shell necklace, probably given to her by her mother, until her death in France. In the 1790s, a free black (the Cape designation for individuals of enslaved descent) trader named Peter Cesars met her and encouraged her to move to Cape Town, which had recently come under British control. Records do not show whether she was made to leave, or went willingly, or was sent by her family to Cesars. She lived in Cape Town for at least two years working in households as a washerwoman and a nursemaid, first for Peter Cesars, then in the house of a Dutch man in Cape Town. She moved finally to be a wet-nurse in the household of Peter Cesars' brother, Hendrik Cesars, outside of Cape Town in present day Woodstock.&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Clifton Crais |author2=Pamela Scully |title=Hendrik Cesars and the Tragedies of Race in South Africa |url=http://www.wondersandmarvels.com/2015/02/hendrik-cesars-and-the-tragedies-of-race-in-south-africa-2.html |website=Wonders and Marvels|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baartman lived alongside slaves in the Cesars' household. As someone of Khoisan descent she could not be formally enslaved{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}, but probably lived in conditions similar to slaves in Cape Town. There is evidence that she had two children, though both died as babies.&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt; She had a relationship with a poor European military man, Hendrik Van Jong, who lived in Hout Bay near Cape Town, but the relationship ended when his regiment left the Cape.&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt; William Dunlop, a Scottish military surgeon in the Cape slave lodge, with a sideline in supplying showmen in Britain with animal specimens, suggested she travel to England to make money by exhibition. Baartman refused. Dunlop persisted and Sara Baartman said she would only go if Hendrik Cesars came too. He also refused, but became ever more in debt in part because of unfavorable lending terms because of his status as free black. Finally, in 1810 he agreed to go to England to make money through putting Baartman on stage. The party left for London in 1810. It is unknown if Baartman went willingly or was forced, but she was in no position to refuse even if she chose to do so.&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt;

Dunlop was the frontman and conspirator behind the plan to exhibit Baartman: According to an English law report of 26 November 1810, an affidavit supplied to the Court of King's Bench from a "Mr. Bullock of Liverpool Museum" stated: "some months since a Mr. Alexander Dunlop, who, he believed, was a surgeon in the army, came to him sell the skin of a Camelopard, which he had brought from the Cape of Good Hope.... Some time after, Mr. Dunlop again called on Mr. Bullock, and told him, that he had then on her way from the Cape, a female Hottentot, of very singular appearance; that she would make the fortune of any person who shewed her in London, and that he (Dunlop) was under an engagement to send her back in two years..."&lt;ref&gt;"Law Report", ''The Times'' (London, England(, 26 November 1810: 3. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 7 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Du Pre Alexander, 2nd Earl of Caledon|Lord Caledon]], governor of the Cape, gave permission for the trip, but later said regretted it after he fully learned the purpose of the trip.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London, England), 29 November 1810, p. 3: "Law Report". Court of King's Bench. The Attorney-General commented: "As to Lord Caledon's permission, it would have been wrong in his lordship to have given it. But it should be known, that ... no contract among them [the Khoisan] was valid unless it was made before a Magistrate. This contract between the Hottentot and Cezar[sic] was made as usual; but when Lord Caledon discovered for what purpose, he was much displeased, and would have stopped the parties if they had then been in his power."&lt;/ref&gt;

===On show in Great Britain ===
[[File:Baartman.jpg|thumb|upright|A caricature of Baartman drawn in the early 19th century]]
[[Image:Hottentot Venus Poster.png|thumb|upright|Baartman's exhibition poster in London]]
Hendrik Cesars and Alexander Dunlop brought Baartman to London in 1810.&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt; The group lived together in Duke Street, St. James, the most expensive part of London. In the household were Sara Baartman, Hendrik Cesars, Alexander Dunlop, and two African boys, probably brought illegally by Dunlop from the slave lodge in Cape Town.&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt;

Dunlop schemed to have Baartman exhibited and Cesars was the showman. Dunlop exhibited Baartman in the Egyptian Hall of [[Piccadilly Circus]] on 24 November 1810.&lt;ref name=leder /&gt; Dunlop thought he could make money because of Londoners' lack of familiarity with Africans and because of Baartman's large bottom. Crais and Scully say: "People came to see her because they saw her not as a person but as a pure example of this one part of the natural world".&lt;ref name=crais_scully/&gt; A handwritten note made on an exhibition flyer by someone who saw Baartman in London in January 1811 indicates curiosity about her origins and probably reproduced some of the language from the exhibition, thus the origin story should be treated with skepticism: "Sartjee is 22 Years old is 4 feet 10 Ins high, and has (for an Hottentot) a good capacity.  She lived in the occupation of a Cook at the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. Her Country is situated not less than 600 Miles from the Cape the Inhabitants of which are rich in Cattle and sell them by barter for a mere trifle, A Bottle of Brandy, or small roll of Tobacco will purchase several Sheep – Their principal trade is in Cattle Skins or Tallow. – Beyond this Nation is an other, of small stature, very subtle &amp; fierce; the Dutch could not bring them under subjection, and shot them whenever they found them.  9th Jany. 1811.  [H.C.?]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchdetail.cfm?trg=1&amp;strucID=352644&amp;imageid=1107949&amp;total=1&amp;e=w|title=Sartjee, the Hottentot Venus|website=NYPL Digital Collections}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of freak shows was longstanding in Britain at this time, and historians have argued that this is at first how Baartman was displayed.&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt; Baartman never allowed herself to be exhibited nude &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Strother, Z.S. (1999). "Display of the Body Hottentot", in Lindfors, B., (ed.), ''Africans on Stage: Studies in Ethnological Show Business''. Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press: 1–55.&lt;/ref&gt; and an account of her appearance in London in 1810 makes it clear that she was wearing a garment, albeit a tight-fitting one.&lt;ref name="Times1"&gt;''The Times'', 26 November 1810, p. 3: "...she is dressed in a colour as nearly resembling her skin as possible. The dress is contrived to exhibit the entire frame of her body, and the spectators are even invited to examine the peculiarities of her form."&lt;/ref&gt;

Her exhibition in London just a few years after the passing of the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] created a scandal. This is in part because British audiences misread Hendrik Cesars, thinking he was a Dutch farmer, boer, from the frontier. Scholars have tended to reproduce that error, but tax rolls at the Cape show he was free black.&lt;ref name="erasure"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scully |first1=Pamela |first2=Clifton |last2=Crais |title=Race and Erasure: Sara Baartman and Hendrik Cesars in Cape Town and London |journal=Journal of British Studies |volume=47 |issue=2 |date=2008 |pages=301–323 |doi=10.1086/526552}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence was part of the show. An [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] benevolent society called the [[African Association]] conducted a newspaper campaign for her release. [[Zachary Macaulay]] led the protest. Hendrik Cesars protested that Baartman was entitled to earn her living, stating: "has she not as good a right to exhibit herself as an Irish Giant or a Dwarf?"&lt;ref name="Qureshi"/&gt; Cesars was comparing Baartman to the contemporary Irish giants [[Charles Byrne (giant)|Charles Byrne]] and [[Patrick Cotter O'Brien]].&lt;ref name=leder&gt;Lederman, Muriel and Ingrid Bartsch (2001).

New York: Routledge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9obFtmhcCNsC&amp;pg=PA351 p. 351].&lt;/ref&gt; Macaulay and The African Association took the matter to court and on 24 November 1810 at the Court of King's Bench the Attorney-General began the attempt "to give her liberty to say whether she was exhibited by her own consent." In support he produced two affidavits in court. The first, from a [[William Bullock (collector)|Mr Bullock]] of Liverpool Museum, was intended to show that Baartman had been brought to Britain by persons who referred to her as if she were property.  The second, by the Secretary of the African Association, described the degrading conditions under which she was exhibited and also gave evidence of coercion.&lt;ref name="Times1"/&gt; Baartman was then questioned before an attorney in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], in which she was fluent, via interpreters. However the conditions of the interview were stacked against her, in part again because the court saw Hendrik Cesars as the boer exploiter, rather than seeing Alexander Dunlop as the organizer.  They thus ensured that Cesars was not in the room when Baartman made her statement, but Dunlop was allowed to remain.

Historians have stated that this therefore casts great doubt on the veracity and independence of the statement that Baartman then made.&lt;ref name=erasure/&gt; She stated that she in fact was not under restraint, did not get sexually abused, and that she came to London on her own free will.&lt;ref name=leder/&gt; She also did not wish to return to her family and understood perfectly that she was guaranteed half of the profits. The case was therefore dismissed.&lt;ref name=erasure/&gt;  She was questioned for three hours. The statements directly contradict accounts of her exhibitions made by [[Zachary Macaulay]] of the [[African Institution]] and other eyewitnesses.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; A written contract was produced,&lt;ref&gt;"Dunlop produced a contract signed by himself and Sara dated 29 October 1810, which was to run from the preceding March for five years. This stated that she was his domestic servant and would allow herself to be exhibited in public in return for 12 guineas a year."{{Cite ODNB|id=73573|title=Baartman, Sarah|first=Karen|last=Harvey}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is considered by some modern commentators to be a legal [[Deception|subterfuge]].&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Qureshi"/&gt;

The publicity given by the court case increased Baartman's popularity as an exhibit.&lt;ref name="Qureshi"/&gt;  She later toured other parts of England and was exhibited at a fair in Limerick, Ireland in 1812. She also was exhibited at a fair at [[Bury St Edmunds]] in [[Suffolk]].&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt;  On 1 December 1811 Baartman was baptized at [[Manchester Cathedral]] and there is evidence that she was married on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', Thursday, 12 December 1811, p. 3: "The African ''fair'' one who has so greatly attracted the notice of the town... is stated to have been baptized on Sunday week last, in the Collegiate church at Manchester, by the name of Sarah Bartmann."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familysearch.org Sarah Bartmann] at England Births and Christenings 1538–1975, FamilySearch.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life in France ===
A man called Henry Taylor took Sara Baartman to France, from around September 1814. Taylor then sold her to an [[Animal training|animal trainer]], S. Réaux, who exhibited her under more pressured conditions for 15 months at the [[Palais Royal]]. In France she was in effect enslaved. In Paris, her exhibition became more clearly entangled with [[scientific racism]]. French scientists were curious about whether she had the [[elongated labia]] which earlier naturalists such as [[François Levaillant]] had purportedly observed in Khoisan at the Cape.&lt;ref&gt;Biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] recounted [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier's]] monograph on Baatman's genitalia, "The [[labia minora]], or inner lips, of the ordinary female genitalia are greatly enlarged in Khoi-San women, and may hang down three or four inches below the [[vulva]] when women stand, thus giving the impression of a separate and enveloping curtain of skin."Gould, Stephen Jay (1985). [https://web.archive.org/web/20100626195901/http://rfrost.people.si.umich.edu//courses/MatCult/content/Gould.pdf "The Hottentot Venus."] ''[[The Flamingo's Smile]]''. New York: W. W. Norton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=whOUFTkj4d4C&amp;pg=PA298 p. 298.]&lt;/ref&gt; French [[Natural history|naturalists]], among them [[Georges Cuvier]], head keeper of the [[menagerie]] at the [[Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle]], and founder of the discipline of comparative anatomy visited her. She was the subject of several scientific paintings at the [[Jardin du Roi]], where she was examined in March 1815: as Saint-Hilaire&lt;ref&gt;Possibly [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frédéric Cuvier]], a younger brother of Georges, reported: "she was obliging enough to undress and to allow herself to be painted in the nude."  This was not literally true: although by his standards she appeared to be naked, in accordance with her own cultural norms of modesty&lt;ref&gt;"It is but justice to the modesty of the Hottentots to say that I have constantly found as many difficulties in the part of the women to submit to the exposure parts which a closer inspection required, as in all probability would have occurred in persuading an equal number of females of any other description to undergo examination." William Somerville, a British surgeon stationed at the Cape between 1799 and 1802, describing his difficulty in gathering information about Khoisan anatomy.&lt;/ref&gt; throughout these sessions she wore a small apron-like garment which concealed her genitalia.  She steadfastly refused to remove this even when offered money by one of the attending scientists.&lt;ref name="Qureshi"/&gt;{{r|crais_scully|page1=131–134}} In Paris, Baartman's promoters didn't need to concern themselves with slavery charges. Crais and Scully state: "By the time she got to Paris, her existence was really quite miserable and extraordinarily poor. Sara was literally treated like an animal. There is some evidence to suggest that at one point a collar was placed around her neck."&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
Baartman died on 29 December 1815 aged 26, of an undetermined&lt;ref name="jsa-154"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of Science and the Arts|year=1818|volume=III|issue=V|page=154|url=https://archive.org/stream/journalsciencea02britgoog#page/n187/mode/1up/search/venus|accessdate=19 July 2010|title=Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences of the Royal Institute of France}}&lt;/ref&gt; inflammatory ailment, possibly [[smallpox]],&lt;ref&gt;''In The Blood'' by Steve Jones has it that "Saartje's hands are covered by the marks of the smallpox that killed her" (p. 204).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Hottentot Venus, it appears from the French papers, died at Paris last week, after an illness of eight days.  Her malady is said to have been the small pox, which the physicians mistook successively for a catarrh, a pleurisy, and a dropsy of the chest." ''The Times'' (London, England), 6 January 1816: 3. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 7 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; while other sources suggest she contracted [[syphilis]],&lt;ref name=atrest/&gt; or [[pneumonia]]. Cuvier conducted a dissection, but did not do an autopsy to inquire into the reasons for Baartman's death.&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt;

French anatomist [[Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville]] published notes on the dissection in 1816, which were republished by [[Georges Cuvier]] in the ''Memoires du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle'' in 1817. Cuvier, who had met Baartman, notes in his [[monograph]] that its subject was an intelligent woman with an excellent memory, particularly for faces. In addition to her native tongue, she spoke fluent Dutch, passable English, and a smattering of French.  He describes her shoulders and back as "graceful", arms "slender", hands and feet as "charming" and "pretty". He adds she was adept at playing the [[jew's harp]],&lt;ref&gt;Cuvier refers to her instrument as a "guimbarde", usually translated into English as "jew's harp": a contemporary illustration however shows Baartman with a Khoi instrument, the [[goura (instrument)|goura]].&lt;/ref&gt; could dance according to the traditions of her country, and had a lively personality.&lt;ref&gt;"Son caractère étoit gai, sa mémoire bonne, et elle reconnoissoit après plusieurs semaines une personne qu'elle n'avoit vue qu'une fois.  Elle parloit tolérablement le hollandais qu'elle avoit appris au Cap, savoit aussi un peu d'anglais, et commencoit à dire quelques mots de francais.  Elle dansoit à la manière de son pays, et jouoit avec assez d'oreille de ce petit instrument qu'on appelle guimbarde....ses épaules, son dos, le haut de sa poitrine avoient de la grace...Ses bras un peu grèles, étoient très-bien faits, et sa main charmante. Son pied étoit aussi fort joli..."("Her personality was lively, her memory good and, after a gap of some weeks, she recognised someone she had seen only the once.  She spoke reasonable Dutch, which she had learned in The Cape, knew some English, and was beginning to say a few words in French.  She danced according to the fashion of her own country, and played on the instrument they call the 'jew's harp' quite by ear....her shoulders, back, and upper chest were graceful...Her arms (rather slender) were very well-made, and her hand charming.  Her foot was also very pretty....") Cuvier, G.:"Extrait d'observations faites sur le cadavre d'une femme connue à Paris et à Londres sous le nomme de Vénus Hottentotte", ''Mémoires du Musée Nationale d'Histoire Naturelle,'' iii (1817), pp. 259–274.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this, Cuvier interpreted her remains, in accordance with his theories on racial evolution, as evidencing ape-like traits.  He thought her small ears were similar to those of an [[orangutan]] and also compared her vivacity, when alive, to the quickness of a [[monkey]].&lt;ref name="Qureshi"/&gt;

[[File:South Africa-Hankey-Sarah Baartmans grave.jpg|thumbnail|right|Sarah Baartman's grave, on a hill overlooking [[Hankey]] in the [[Gamtoos River]] Valley, Eastern Cape, South Africa]]

From the 1940s, there were sporadic calls for the return of her remains. A poem written in 1978 by [[Diana Ferrus]], herself of Khoisan descent, entitled "I've come to take you home", played a pivotal role in spurring the movement to bring Baartman's remains back to her birth soil.&lt;ref name=atrest/&gt; The case gained world-wide prominence only after [[Stephen Jay Gould]] wrote ''The Mismeasure of Man'' in the 1980s. Mansell Upham, a researcher and jurist specializing in South African colonial history also helped spur the movement to bring Baartman's remains back to South Africa.&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt; After the victory of the [[African National Congress]] in the [[South African general election, 1994]], President [[Nelson Mandela]] formally requested that France return the remains.  After much legal wrangling and debates in the [[French National Assembly]], France acceded to the request on 6 March 2002. Her remains were repatriated to her homeland, the Gamtoos Valley, on 6 May 2002,&lt;ref name=bbcnews2002&gt;{{cite news |title='Hottentot Venus' goes home|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/europe/1957240.stm |work=BBC News|date=29 April 2002|accessdate=13 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were buried on 9 August 2002 on ''Vergaderingskop'', a hill in the town of [[Hankey]] over 200 years after her birth.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the politics of her return, see chapter 7 Crais and Scully, ''Sara Baartman and the Hottentot Venus''&lt;/ref&gt;

Baartman became an icon in South Africa as representative of many aspects of the [[history of South Africa|nation's history]]. The Saartjie Baartman Centre for Women and Children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saartjiebaartmancentre.org.za|title=Saartjie Baartman Centre for Women and Children}}&lt;/ref&gt; a refuge for survivors of [[domestic violence]], opened in Cape Town in 1999. South Africa's first offshore environmental protection vessel, the ''[[Sarah Baartman (ship)|Sarah Baartman]]'', is also named after her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news24.com/News24/Technology/News/0,,2-13-1443_1645283,00.html  |title=SA takes on poachers |date= 11 November 2005 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930211009/http://www.news24.com/News24/Technology/News/0,,2-13-1443_1645283,00.html |archivedate = 30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symbolism ===
Sarah Baartman was not the only Khoikhoi to be taken from her homeland. Her story is always used as a symbol to illustrate various social and political strains, and through these applications, her true story has been lost among the discussions. Dr. Yvette Abraham, professor of women and gender studies at the [[University of the Western Cape]] says, "we lack academic studies that view Sarah Baartman as anything other than a symbol. Her story becomes marginalized, as it is always used to illustrate some other topic…." For some reason, Baartman is always employed to represent African discrimination and suffering in the West, even though there were many other Khoekhoe people who were taken to Europe. For example, historian Neil Parsons writes about two Khoekhoe children of 13 and six who were taken from South Africa and displayed at a holiday fair in Elberfeld, Germany, 1845. Secondly, a traveling show called the Bosjemans traveled around Britain, Ireland, and France, consisting of two men, women, and one baby. The circus was in business from 1846 to 1855. Thirdly, P. T. Barnum's show, called "Little People", advertised a 16-year-old girl by the name of Flora as the "missing link" and acquired six more Khoekhoe children after her. These are just some of the cases of Khoekhoe Africans who were enslaved and put on display in the West. There may be some reason Baartman's tale is so famous. She was the first Khoekhoe to be taken from her homeland. However, instead of being the first, it is most likely that her fame is due to the extensive exploitation of her body by the general public and scientists such as [[Georges Cuvier]], as well as the horrible mistreatment she received during her life and after her death. She was brought to the West solely on the premise of her exaggerated female form, and the European public found a sickening obsession with her reproductive organs. Her body parts were on display at the [[Musée de l'Homme]] for 150 years, and her story as a symbol may be due to the awareness and sympathy it has evoked in the public eye. Even though Baartman was the first Khoekhoe to land in Europe, much of her story has been lost, and she is instead defined by her tragic utilization and exploitation in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Representation and Black Womanhood: The Legacy of Sarah Baartman|last=Gordon-Chipembere|first=Natasha|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2011|isbn=978-1-349-29798-6|location=New York|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Her body as a foundation for scientific racism==
[[File:A Pair of Broad Bottoms.jpg|thumb|upright|1810 caricature of Baartman by [[William Heath (artist)|William Heath]]]] [[Julien-Joseph Virey]] used Sarah Baartman's published image to validate racial typologies. In his essay "Dictionnaire des sciences medicales" (Dictionary of medical sciences), he summarizes the true nature of the black female within the framework of accepted medical discourse. Virey focused on identifying her sexual organs as more developed and distinct in comparison to white female organs. All of his theories regarding sexual primitivism are influenced and supported by the anatomical studies and illustrations of Sarah Baartman which were created by [[Georges Cuvier]].&lt;ref name=gilman/&gt; In cartoons and drawings Baartman's features were often exaggerated to highlight her difference from European females. This social construction of visual imagery likely amplified and reinforced racist perspectives. Little of this knowledge can be considered completely factual as most knowledge of Baartman is not extrapolated from diverse sources of documentation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Sexism===
During 1814–70, there were at least seven scientific descriptions of the bodies of women of color done in comparative anatomy. Cuvier's dissection of Baartman helped shape European science. Baartman, along with several other African women who were dissected, were referred to as Hottentots, or sometimes Bushwomen. The "savage woman" was seen as very distinct from the "civilised female" of Europe, thus 19th-century scientists were fascinated by "the Hottentot Venus". In the 1800s, people in London were able to pay two shillings apiece to gaze upon her body in wonder. Baartman was considered a freak of nature. For extra pay, one could even poke her with a stick or finger. Sara Baartman's organs, genitalia, and buttocks were thought to be evidence of her sexual primitivism and intellectual equality with that of an orangutan.

===Colonialism===
There has been much speculation and study about [[South Africa#European colonisation|colonialist influence]] that relates to Baartman's name, social status, her illustrated and performed presentation as the "Hottentot Venus", and the negotiation for her body's return to her homeland.&lt;ref name="crais_scully"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt; These components and events in Baartman's life have been used by activists and theorists to determine the ways in which 19th-century European colonists exercised control and authority over Khoekhoe people and simultaneously crafted racist and sexist ideologies about their culture.&lt;ref name=erasure/&gt; In addition to this, recent scholars have begun to analyze the surrounding events leading up to Baartman's return to her homeland and conclude that it is an expression of recent contemporary post colonial objectives.&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt;

In Janet Shibamoto's book review of Deborah Cameron's book ''Feminism and Linguistic Theory'', Shibamoto discusses Cameron's study on the patriarchal context within language, which consequentially influences the way in which women continue to be contained by or subject to ideologies created by the patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Shibamoto, S Janet. Feminism and Linguistic Theory by Deborah Cameron (Book Review), ''Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society'' (1988): 635–640.Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars have presented information on how Baartman's life was heavily controlled and manipulated by colonialist and patriarchal language.{{r|crais_scully|page1=131–134}}

Baartman grew up on a farm. There is no historical documentation of her indigenous Khoisan name.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon-Chipembere, Natasha ( 2011). ''Representation and Black Womanhood''. Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; She was given the Dutch name "Saartjie" by Dutch colonists who occupied the land she lived on during her childhood. According to Clifton Crais and Pamela Scully:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Her first name is the Cape Dutch form for "Sarah" which marked her as a colonialist's servant. "Saartje" the diminutive, was also a sign of affection. Encoded in her first name were the tensions of affection and exploitation. Her surname literally means "bearded man" in Dutch. It also means uncivilized, uncouth, barbarous, savage. Saartjie Baartman – the savage servant.{{r|crais_scully|page1=9}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dutch colonizers also bestowed the term "Hottentot", which is derived from "hot" and "tot", Dutch approximations of common sounds in the Khoi language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/hottentot |title=etymologiebank.nl |publisher=etymologiebank.nl |date= |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch used this word when referencing Khoikhoi people because of the clicking sounds and staccato pronunciations that characterize the Khoikhoi language; these components of the [[Khoekhoe language|Khoikhoi language]] were considered strange and "bestial" to Dutch colonizers.&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt; The term was used until the 20th century, at which point most people understood its effect as a derogatory term.&lt;ref&gt;Mary McMahon, [http://originalpeople.org/saartjie-sarah-baartman-hottentot-venus/ "Who are the Hottentots"], ''Wise Geek'', 9 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Travelogues that circulated in Europe would describe Africa as being "uncivilized" and lacking regard for religious virtue.&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt; Travelogues and imagery depicting Black women as "sexually primitive" and "savage" enforced the belief that it was in Africa's best interest to be colonized by European settlers. Cultural and religious conversion was considered to be an altruistic act with imperialist undertones; colonizers believed that they were reforming and correcting Khoisan culture in the name of the Christian faith and empire.&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt;

During the lengthy negotiation to have Baartman's body returned to her home country after her death, the assistant curator of the Musée de l'Homme, [[Philippe Mennecier]], argued against her return, stating: "We never know what science will be able to tell us in the future. If she is buried, this chance will be lost ... for us she remains a very important treasure." According to Sadiah Qureshi, due to the continued treatment of Baartman's body as a cultural artifact, Philippe Mennecier's statement is contemporary evidence of the same type of ideology that surrounded Baartman's body while she was alive in the 18th century.&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt;

==Feminist reception==

===Traditional iconography of Sarah Baartman and feminist contemporary art===
Many African female diasporic artists have criticized the traditional iconography of Baartman. According to the studies of contemporary feminists, traditional iconography and historical illustrations of Baartman are effective in revealing the ideological representation of black women in art throughout history. Such studies assess how the traditional iconography of the black female body was institutionally and scientifically defined in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=gilman&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilman |first=Sander L. |title=Black Bodies, White Bodies: Toward an iconography of Female Sexuality in Late Nineteenth Century Art, Medicine, and Literature |journal=Critical Inquiry |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |date=1985 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=204–242 |jstor=1343468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renee Cox]], Renee Green, Joyce Scott, Lorna Simpson, Cara Mae Weems and Deborah Willis are artists who seek to investigate contemporary social and cultural issues that still surround the African female body. [[Sander Gilman]], a cultural and literary historian states: "While many groups of African Blacks were known to Europeans in the 19th century, the Hottentot remained representative of the essence of the Black, especially the Black female. Both concepts fulfilled the iconographic function in the perception and representation of the world."&lt;ref name=gilman/&gt;
His article "Black Bodies, White Bodies: Toward an Iconography of Female Sexuality in the Late Nineteenth Century Art, Medicine and Literature" traces art historical records of black women in European art, and also proves that the association of black women with concupiscence within art history has been illustrated consistently since the beginning of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=gilman/&gt;

[[Lyle Ashton Harris]] and Renee Valerie Cox worked in collaboration to produce the photographic piece Hottentot Venus 2000.  In this piece, Harris photographs Victoria Cox who presents herself as Baartman while wearing large, sculptural, gold, metal breasts and buttocks attached to her body.&lt;ref name=willis&gt;Willis, Deborah. "Black Venus 2010: They called her 'Hottentot.'" Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2010. Project Muse&lt;/ref&gt; According to Deborah Willis, the paraphernalia attached to Cox's body are markers for the way in which Baartman's sexual body parts were essential for her constructed role or function as the "Hottentot Venus". Willis also explains that Cox's side-angle shot makes reference to the "scientific" traditional propaganda used by Cuvier and Julian-Joseph Virey, who sourced Baartman's traditional illustrations and iconography to publish their "scientific" findings.&lt;ref name=willis /&gt;

Reviewers of Harris and Cox's work have commented that the presence of "the gaze" in the photograph of Cox presents a critical engagement with previous traditional imagery of Baartman.&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt; [[bell hooks]] has elaborated further on the function of the gaze:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The gaze has been and is a site of resistance for colonized black people globally. Subordinates in relations of power learn experientially that there is a critical gaze, one that "looks" to document, one that is oppositional. In resistance struggle, the power of the dominated to assert agency by claiming and cultivating "awareness" politicizes "looking" relations – one learns to look a certain way in order to resist.&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell. (1992) Black Looks : Race and Representation. South End Press.  pp. 115 – 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Permitted" is an installation piece created by Renee Samwise Green inspired by Sarah Baartman. Green created a specific viewing arrangement to investigate the European perception of the black female body as "exotic", "bizarre" and "monstrous". Viewers were prompted to step onto the installed platform which was meant to evoke a stage, where Baartman may have been exhibited. Green recreates the basic setting of Baartman's exhibition. At the centre of the platform, which there is a large image of Baartman, and wooden rulers or slats with an engraved caption by Francis Galton encouraging viewers to measure Baartman's buttocks. In the installation there is also a peephole that allows viewers to see an image of Baartman standing on a crate. According to Willis, the implication of the peephole,  demonstrates how ethnographic imagery of the black female form in the 19th century functioned as a form of pornography for Europeans present at Baartmans exhibit.&lt;ref name=willis/&gt;

In her film ''Reassemblage: From the firelight to the screen'', [[Trinh T. Minh-ha]] comments on the ethnocentric bias that the colonizers eye applies to the naked female form, arguing that this bias causes the nude female body to be seen as inherently sexually provocative, promiscuous and pornographic within the context of European or western culture.&lt;ref&gt;Min-ha, Trin – T, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc5G2-rTKis "Reassemblage: From the firelight to the screen."], ''Youtube'', 23 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Feminist artists are interested in re-representing Baartman's image, and work to highlight the stereotypes and ethnocentric bias surrounding the black female body based on art historical representations and iconography that occurred before, after and during Baartman's lifetime.&lt;ref name=willis/&gt;

===Media representation and feminist criticism===
In November 2014, ''[[Paper Magazine]]'' released a cover of [[Kim Kardashian]] in which she was illustrated as balancing a champagne glass on her extended rear. The cover received much criticism for endorsing "the exploitation and fetishism of the black female body".&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Jolie, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/11/13/kim-kardashian-photo-black-female-bodies-grio/18962603/ "Kardashian photo plays off controversial black imagery"] ''USA today'', 13 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The similarities with the way in which Baartman was represented as the "Hottentot Venus" during the 19th century have prompted much criticism and commentary.&lt;ref name=thomas&gt;Thomas, Geneva, [http://www.clutchmagonline.com/2010/10/kim-kardashian-posing-black-femaleness/ "Kim Kardashian: Posing Black Femaleness?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304125606/http://www.clutchmagonline.com/2010/10/kim-kardashian-posing-black-femaleness/# |date=4 March 2016 }} ''Clutch''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to writer Geneva S. Thomas, anyone that is aware of black women's history under colonialist influence would consequentially be aware that Kardashian's photo easily elicits memory regarding the visual representation of Baartman.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;
The photographer and director of the photo, [[Jean-Paul Goude]], based the photo on his previous work "Carolina Beaumont", taken of a nude model in 1976 and published in his book ''Jungle Fever''.&lt;ref name=Miller2014&gt;Miller, Kelsey, [http://www.refinery29.com/2014/11/77809/kim-kardashian-carolina-beaumont-john-paul-goude "The Troubling Racial History of Kim K's Champagne Shot"], ''Refinery 29'', 13 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''People Magazine'' article in 1979 about his relationship with model [[Grace Jones]] describes Goude in the following statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jean-Paul has been fascinated with women like Grace since his youth. The son of a French engineer and an American-born dancer, he grew up in a Paris suburb. From the moment he saw West Side Story and the Alvin Ailey dance troupe, he found himself captivated by "ethnic minorities" — black girls, PRs. "I had jungle fever." He now says, "Blacks are the premise of my work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20073475,00.html|title=When Disco Queen Grace Jones Lamented 'I Need a Man,' Artist Jean-Paul Goude Prowled Too Near Her Cage|date=|work=people.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Days before the shoot, Goude often worked with his models to find the best "hyperbolized" position to take his photos. His model and partner, Grace Jones, would also pose for days prior to finally acquiring the perfect form. "That's the basis of my entire work," Goude states, "creating a credible illusion."&lt;ref name=Miller2014/&gt; Similarly, Baartman and other black female slaves were illustrated and depicted in a specific form to identify features, which were seen as proof of ideologies regarding black female primitivism.&lt;ref name=gilman /&gt;

The professional background of Goude and the specific posture and presentation of Kardashian's image in the recreation on the cover of ''[[Paper Magazine]]'' has caused feminist critics to comment how the objectification of the Baartman's body and the ethnographic representation of her image in 19th-century society presents a comparable and complementary parallel to how Kardashian is currently represented in the media.&lt;ref name=telusma&gt;Telusma, Blue, [http://thegrio.com/2014/11/12/kim-kardashian-butt/ "Kim Kardashian doesn't realize she's the butt of an old racial joke"], ''The Grio'', 12 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the November 2014 photograph of Kim Kardashian, Cleuci de Oliveira published an article on [[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] titled "Saartjie Baartman: The Original Bootie Queen", which claims that Sarah Baartman was "always an agent in her own path."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jezebel.com/saartje-baartman-the-original-booty-queen-1658569879|title=Saartjie Baartman: The Original Booty Queen|last=Oliveira|first=Cleuci de|work=Jezebel|access-date=28 November 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oliveira goes on to assert that Baartman performed on her own terms and was unwilling to view herself as a tool for scientific advancement, an object of entertainment, or a pawn of the state.

Neelika Jayawardane, a literature professor and editor of the website Africa is a Country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africasacountry.com/author/neelika71/|title=Neelika Jayawardane|website=Africa is a Country|language=en-US|access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a response to Oliveira's article. Jayawardane criticizes de Oliveira's work, stating that she "did untold damage to what the historical record shows about Baartman."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://africasacountry.com/2014/11/when-jezebel-wanted-to-make-saartjie-baartman-relevant-to-millenials-epicfail-2/|title=#EpicFail When @Jezebel Wanted to make Saartjie Baartman Relevant to Millenials|date=18 November 2014|work=Africa is a Country|access-date=28 November 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jayawardane's article is cautious about introducing what she considers false agency to historical figures such as Baartman.

Frieze.com published an article entitled "‘Body Talk: Feminism, Sexuality and the Body in the Work of Six African Women Artists’, curated by Cameroonian-born Koyo Kouoh", which mentions Baartman's legacy and its impact on young female African artists. The work linked to Baartman is meant to reference the ethnographic exhibits of the 19th century that enslaved Baartman and displayed her naked body. Artist Oka's (''Untitled'', 2015) rendered a live performance of a black naked woman in a cage with the door swung open, walking around a sculpture of male genitalia, repeatedly. Her work was so impactful it led one audience member to proclaim,  "Do we allow this to happen because we are in the white cube, or are we revolted by it?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://frieze.com/article/body-talk|title=Body Talk|website=frieze.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oka's work has been described as 'black feminist art' where the female body is a site for activism and expression. The article also mentions other African female icons and how artists are expressing themselves through performance and discussion by posing the question "How Does the White Man Represent the Black Woman?".

James McKay and Helen Johnson, social scientists from England and Australia, respectively, invoke Baartman to fit newspaper coverage of the tennis-playing [[Venus Williams|Venus]] and [[Serena Williams]] within racist trans-historical narratives of "pornographic eroticism" and "sexual grotesquerie." According to McKay and Johnson, white male reporters covering the Williams sisters have fixated upon their on-court fashions and their muscular bodies, while downplaying their on-court achievements, describing their bodies as mannish, animalistic, or hyper-sexual, rather than well-developed. Their victories have been attributed to their supposed natural physical superiorities, while their defeats have been blamed on their supposed lack of discipline. This analysis demonstrates that commentary on the size of Serena's breasts and bottom, in particular, mirrors the spectacle made of Baartman's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKay|first=James|last2=Johnson|first2=Helen|date=July 2008|title=Pornographic eroticism and sexual grotesquerie in representations of African American sportswomen|url=|journal=Social Identitities|volume=14|issue=4|pages=491-504|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display of remains==

After Baartman's death, Geoffroy Saint Hilaire applied on behalf of the [[Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle|Muséum d' Histoire Naturelle]] to retain her corpse on the grounds that it was of singular specimen of humanity and therefore of special scientific interest.&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt; The application was approved and Baartman's skeleton and body cast were displayed in [[Muséum d'histoire naturelle d’Angers]]. Her skull was stolen in 1827 but returned a few months later. The restored skeleton and skull continued to arouse the interest of visitors until the remains were moved to the Musée de l'Homme, when it was founded in 1937, and continued up until the late 1970s. Her body cast and skeleton stood side by side and faced away from the viewer which emphasized her [[steatopygia]] (accumulation of fat on the buttocks) while reinforcing that aspect as the primary interest of her body. The Baartman exhibit proved popular until it elicited complaints  for being a degrading representation of women. The skeleton was removed in 1974, and the body cast in 1976.&lt;ref name=Qureshi/&gt;

The '''Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory''' was founded in Nicolson Street, [[Edinburgh]] in 1906, by [[William Speirs Bruce]], who had travelled widely in the [[Antarctic]] and [[Arctic]] regions and had led the [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]] (SNAE) 1902&amp;ndash;04. Bruce had originally studied medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]], but had transferred his studies to the [[natural sciences]] and, through his varied experiences, had established a reputation as a polar scientist. He had also collected a large number of [[botany|botanical]], [[biology|biological]], [[zoology|zoological]] and [[geology|geological]] specimens, together with vast amounts of [[meteorology|meteorological]] and [[magnetism|magnetic]] data.  The laboratory, established in [[Edinburgh]] at premises in Nicolson Street, provided a place to examine, store or display these materials, an office from which Bruce could work on the SNAE scientific reports, and a base from which further expeditions could be planned.&lt;ref name = Speak&gt;Speak, pp. 97&amp;ndash;101&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Bruce's ambition that the laboratory should develop into a Scottish National Oceanographical Institute. A meeting to discuss this possibility was held in May 1914, and the proposal gained significant support from leading Scottish scientists. An organising committee was established, but the matter was shelved on the outbreak of war in August 1914 and was not revived.&lt;ref name = Speak/&gt; In 1919 lack of funding, combined with his failing health, forced Bruce to close the laboratory, donating the various specimens, books and other materials to the University of Edinburgh, the [[Royal Scottish Geographical Society]] and the [[National Museums of Scotland|Royal Scottish Museum]].&lt;ref name = Speak/&gt; His illness ended with his death in 1921.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13131">A '''solar bus''' or '''solar-charged bus''' is a [[bus]] which is powered exclusively or mainly by [[solar energy]].  A solar-powered bus service is referred to as a '''solar bus service'''.  The use of the term "solar bus" normally implies that solar energy is used not only for powering electric equipment on the bus, but also for the [[propulsion]] of the vehicle.

Existing solar buses are [[battery electric bus]]es or (in the case of hybrid solar buses) [[hybrid bus]]es equipped with [[Electric-vehicle battery|batteries]] which are recharged from solar (or other) power sources; a launch of a solar bus service often goes hand in hand with investments for large-scale installations of stationary [[solar panel]]s with [[photovoltaic cell]]s.  Similarly as other [[solar vehicle]]s, many solar buses have photovoltaic cells contained in [[solar panel]]s on the vehicle's roof which convert the [[sun]]'s energy directly into [[electric energy]] to be used by the engine.

The introduction of solar buses and other [[green vehicle]]s for purposes of [[public transport]] forms a part of [[sustainable transport]] schemes.

== About ==

=== Solar-only and solar-electric bus services ===
The distinction between a solar-only electric bus and an electro-solar bus is fluid, as the distinction depends on the actual usage: whether the bus is recharged from solar or other power sources.

Solar-only bus services involve recharging the bus from solar energy, usually from solar panel-covered [[bus station]] [[Canopy (building)|canopies]].  The concept is similar to that of [[solar parking plot]] for cars and bicycles, where vehicles can re-charge while parked.  The need for recharging poses constraints on the run and standstill times of the bus.  The implementation of a solar bus service benefits from an optimization of over-all requirements for the specific bus service.&lt;ref name="ait-2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ait.ac.at/fileadmin/cmc/downloads/Magazine/Neu/Tomorrow_Today_Dezember_2011_en.pdf |pages=22–25 |title=The right drive for e-mobility |publisher= |date=December 2011 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electro-solar buses are powered additionally from electric power [[Electric power transmission|transmitted]] from power plants; hybrid solar buses may be equipped with [[hybrid engine]]s.

=== Commercially available shuttle buses ===
Open air low-speed electric shuttle sightseeing buses equipped with a solar panel-covered roof are produced in series and are commercially available.  According to the producers, the solar panels save energy and prolong the battery life cycle.

=== Australia ===
The '''Tindo''' solar battery-charged bus ("Tindo", [[Kaurna language|Kaurna]] word for ''sun'') is an experimental [[battery electric vehicle]] that operates in [[Adelaide|Adelaide, Australia]]. It is the world's first solar bus, operating since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnn.com/green-tech/transportation/photos/7-modern-solar-powered-vehicles/tindo-solar-bus |title=7 modern solar-powered vehicles: Tindo Solar Bus &amp;#124; MNN - Mother Nature Network |publisher=MNN |date= |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses 100% solar power, is equipped with a [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking system]] and air conditioning and can carry up to 40 persons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Kien |last1=To |first2=John E. |last2=Fernández |title=Alternative urban technologies demonstration projects for innovative cities |work=Third International Engineering Systems Symposium, CESUN 2012, Delft University of Technology |date=18–20 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 25 of whom are seated.  The bus itself is not equipped with solar panels.  It receives electric power from a [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] system on Adelaide's central [[bus station]].  Hailed as the world's first bus service powered exclusively by solar power, the bus service connects Adelaide City and North Adelaide as part of Adelaide City's sustainable transport agenda.  The Tindo is part of the 98A and 98C bus service (until recently known as the Adelaide Connector) which is offered as [[free public transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/1245/ |title=All-Electric, Solar-Powered, Free Bus!!! |publisher=Ecogeek.org |date=2007-12-27 |accessdate=2013-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908184215/http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/1245/ |archivedate=2009-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yoursay.adelaidecitycouncil.com/city-connector-bus |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222075212/http://yoursay.adelaidecitycouncil.com/city-connector-bus |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
Within the Chinese government's program for clean transport sector, [[China]]'s first solar hybrid buses were put in operation in July 2012 in the city of [[Qiqihar]]. Its engine is powered by [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]] which are fed by solar panels installed on the bus roof. It is claimed that each bus consumes 0.6 to 0.7 kilowatt-hours of electricity per kilometer and can transport up to 100 persons, and that the use of solar panels prolongs the batteries' lifetime by 35 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naftcenews.wvu.edu/naftc_enews/2012/9/7/china-reveals-new-solar-buses |title=China Reveals New Solar Buses |publisher=[[West Virginia University]] |date=2012-09-07 |accessdate=2013-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009112858/http://naftcenews.wvu.edu/naftc_enews/2012/9/7/china-reveals-new-solar-buses |archivedate=2015-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
Austria's first solar-powered bus was put in operation in the village of [[Perchtoldsdorf]]. Its [[powertrain]], operating strategy, and [[design specification]] were specifically optimized in view of its planned regular service routes.  It has been in trial operation since autumn 2011.&lt;ref name="ait-2013"/&gt;

The [[Hybrid electric bus#Tribrid Bus|tribrid bus]] is a [[hybrid electric bus]] developed by the [[University of Glamorgan]], [[Wales]], for use as student transport between the University’s different campuses.  It is powered by [[hydrogen fuel]] or [[solar cell]]s, batteries and [[ultracapacitor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Green 'tribrid' minibus unveiled|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/7436908.stm |work=BBC |date=2008-06-05 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Launch of Europe's First Tribrid Green Minibus |url=http://news.glam.ac.uk/news/en/2008/may/30/launch-europes-first-tibrid-green-minibus/ |work= |date=2008-05-30 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UK ===

The first Solar Bus in the UK launched in [[Brighton]] April 2017. Following a marathon six week effort from hundreds of local people, [[The Big Lemon]] and [[Brighton Energy Coop]]'s joint Solar Bus project has won funding from the M&amp;S Community Energy Fund to cover the roof of [[The Big Lemon]]’s bus depot in solar panels to power the new electric buses on clean green renewable energy.  The bus was named by one of the Solar Roof partners, Viper IT Solutions and is called "Om Shanti".

The 120 solar panels will generate 30,000kW of electricity – the equivalent of 1.8 million boiled kettles. With no emissions, the Solar Buses will reduce noxious gases in some of Brighton and Hove’s most polluted areas and will power the 52 route between Woodingdean and [[Brighton]] on 100% renewable energy.

The Solar Bus project was one of 199 different applications to the scheme, 125 of which were shortlisted.  These were put to public vote for six weeks during September and October and the voting process also included the option to donate to the project via the Crowdfunding platform.

The Solar Bus project was one of 19 regional winners, with 1549 votes, 170 pledges, and a total of £13,325 raised through crowdfunding, almost half the total amount of £28,798 raised through the scheme nationally.  The project will benefit from £12,500 funding from M&amp;S Energy which, together with the £13,325 crowdfunding donations will fund the solar array on the roof of the bus depot.

===Uganda===
The Kayoola Solar Bus is a 35-seater electric solar bus with zero tailpipe emissions, a range of 80 km, with latent range extension from the real-time charging enabled by the roof mounted solar panels. The development of the Kayoola Solar Bus Concept represents the commitment of the Kiira Motors Project to championing the progressive development of local capacity for Vehicle Technology Innovation, a key ingredient for institutionalizing a sustainable Vehicle Manufacturing Industry in Uganda. &lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/15/africa/africa-solar-bus-kiira-uganda/index.html?iid=ob_lockedrail_topeditorial&amp;iref=obnetwork&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://kiiramotors.com/kayoola.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The Solar Buzz is a 14-seater US Electricar bus, made in 1994, that has been repurposed as the world's first truly solar bus in [[Truth or Consequences, New Mexico]] in 2011.  The Buzz has 2 KW in homemade solar panels on the roof, 40 golf cart batteries, 2 electric motors, and has no tailpipe.  The power required to go one mile is the same as the power required to make a pot of coffee:  around 700 Wh.  The Solar Buzz is an IntraCity bus approved by the state Public Regulation Commission (#56817) in 2015 and is a commercial daytime private shuttle service with a US$3 Fare, operated by Hot Springs Transit, LLC.  &lt;ref&gt;http://krqe.com/2016/01/28/new-mexico-woman-invents-states-first-solar-powered-bus/&lt;/ref&gt; Hot Springs Transit provides transit service to the 6100 person population of Truth or Consequences.

== Other forms of green bus transport ==

=== Non-solar powered engines ===
Solar panels are also used for powering electronic devices of the bus such as heating and air conditioning, even in buses with non-solar-powered engine. In the US, such buses are advertised to meet [[anti-idling]] regulations in several states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Bauer introduces solar bus powering system at BusCon |url=http://www.metro-magazine.com/news/story/2010/10/gary-bauer-introduces-solar-bus-powering-system-at-buscon.aspx |work=metro magazine |date=2010-10-06 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Refitting existing non-existing vehicles with photovoltaic panels that feed the original battery with additional electric power has been shown to have the potential for making a substantial contribution to [[CO2 emission]] mitigation and to the [[pollution prevention|reduction of pollution]].&lt;ref name="Donno-2012"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Monica |last1=Donno |first2=Aleck |last2=Ferrari |first3=Annalisa |last3=Scarpelli |first4=Pietro |last4=Perlo |first5=Alberto |last5=Bocca |title=Mechatronic system for energy efficiency in bus transport |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6176493&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6176493 |work=Design, Automation &amp; Test in Europe Conference &amp; Exhibition, 2012 |pages=342–343 |date=12–16 March 2012 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The thus transformed buses are however not solar buses in the strict sense of the word, as they do not use solar energy for propulsion.  The use of buses in public transport implies frequent stops with the opening and closing of doors, which influence the way the energy of the battery is used.&lt;ref name="Donno-2012"/&gt;

=== Renewable energy powered ===
In principle also [[trolleybus]]es or other non-autonomous electric buses or alternately powered buses such as [[fuel cell bus]]es or [[dual-mode bus]]es could be used for solar bus services, provided the origin of all or most of the energy used for propulsing the bus would be solar energy. In practice however such systems also draw on other sources of energy, at least also other [[renewable energy]] sources such as [[wind energy]]. An example is that the city of [[Hamburg]], Germany, received the 2011 [[European Green Capital Award]] for, among others, its fuel cell bus service that is claimed to be the world's largest hydrogen-powered bus fleet and is intended to use hydrogen generated from solar and wind energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/europeangreencapital/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Hamburg_DE_LowResolution_DE-new1.pdf |page=8 |title=Hamburg, Preisträger 2011,  |publisher=[[European Commission]] |date= |language=German |accessdate=2013-01-13}}, {{DOI|10.2779/78216}}, {{ISBN|978-92-79-21368-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{linguistics}}

In [[linguistics]], '''syntax''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|t|æ|k|s}}{{refn|{{OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=2016-01-22|syntax}}}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|=2016-01-22|syntax}}}}) is the set of rules, principles, and processes that govern the structure of [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] in a given [[Natural language|language]], usually including [[word order]]. The term ''syntax'' is also used  to refer to the study of such principles and processes.&lt;ref name="Chomsky def"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |year=2002 |origyear=1957 |title= Syntactic Structures |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SNeHkMXHcd8C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22syntax+is%22 11]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of many syntacticians is to discover the [[Universal grammar|syntactic rules]] common to all languages.

In mathematics, ''syntax'' refers to the rules governing the notation of mathematical systems, such as [[formal language]]s used in [[logic]]. (See [[Syntax (logic)|logical syntax]].)

== Etymology ==
The word ''syntax'' comes from [[Ancient Greek]]: {{wikt-lang|grc|σύνταξις}} "coordination", which consists of {{lang|grc|σύν}} ''syn'', "together", and {{lang|grc|τάξις}} ''táxis'', "an ordering".

==Sequencing of subject, verb, and object==

A basic feature of a language's syntax is the sequence in which the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] (S), [[verb]] (V), and [[object (grammar)|object]] (O) usually appear in sentences. Over 85% of languages usually place the subject first, either in the sequence [[subject-verb-object|SVO]] or the sequence [[subject-object-verb|SOV]]. The other possible sequences are [[verb-subject-object|VSO]], [[verb-object-subject|VOS]], [[object-verb-subject|OVS]], and [[object-subject-verb|OSV]], the last three of which are rare.

== Early history ==
Works on [[grammar]] were written long before modern syntax came about; in [[Ancient India|Ancient]] [[India]], the ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' of [[Pāṇini]] (c. 4th century BC) is often cited as an example of a premodern work that approaches the sophistication of a modern syntactic theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fortson IV |first=Benjamin W. |title=Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction |publisher=Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn=978-1405188968 |page=186 |quote=[The ''Aṣṭādhyāyī''] is a highly precise and thorough description of the structure of Sanskrit somewhat resembling modern generative grammar...[it] remained the most advanced linguistic analysis of any kind until the twentieth century.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the West, the school of thought that came to be known as "traditional grammar" began with the work of [[Dionysius Thrax]].

For centuries, work in syntax was dominated by a framework known as {{lang|fr|grammaire générale}}, first expounded in 1660 by [[Antoine Arnauld]] in a book of the same title. This system took as its basic premise the assumption that language is a direct reflection of thought processes and therefore there is a single, most natural way to express a thought.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

However, in the 19th century, with the development of [[historical-comparative linguistics]], linguists began to realize the sheer diversity of human language and to question fundamental assumptions about the relationship between language and logic. It became apparent that there was no such thing as the most natural way to express a thought, and therefore [[logic]] could no longer be relied upon as a basis for studying the structure of language.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The [[Port-Royal-des-Champs|Port-Royal grammar]] modeled the study of syntax upon that of logic. (Indeed, large parts of the [[Port-Royal Logic]] were copied or adapted from the ''Grammaire générale''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnauld |first=Antoine |title=La logique |year=1683 |edition=5th |location=Paris |publisher=G. Desprez |url=http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/Visualiseur?Destination=Gallica&amp;O=NUMM-57444 |quote={{lang|fr|Nous avons emprunté...ce que nous avons dit...d'un petit Livre...sous le titre de Grammaire générale.}} |pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Syntactic categories were identified with logical ones, and all sentences were analyzed in terms of "subject – copula – predicate". Initially, this view was adopted even by the early comparative linguists such as [[Franz Bopp]].

The central role of syntax within [[theoretical linguistics]] became clear only in the 20th century, which could reasonably be called the "century of syntactic theory" as far as linguistics is concerned. (For a detailed and critical survey of the history of syntax in the last two centuries, see the monumental work by Giorgio Graffi (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Giorgio |first=Graffi |year= 2001 |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/200_Years_of_Syntax.html?id=mydolrE-PPkC |title= 200 Years of Syntax: A Critical Survey |format=googlebook preview |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |isbn=9789027284570  }}&lt;/ref&gt;.)

== Theories ==
There are a number of theoretical approaches to the discipline of syntax. One school of thought, founded in the works of [[Derek Bickerton]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |title=Language and Species |author=Bickerton, Derek |year=1990 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-04610-9}} and, for more recent advances, {{cite book |title=Biological foundations and origin of syntax |editor1=Derek Bickerton |editor2=Eörs Szathmáry |year=2009 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=978-0-262-01356-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; sees syntax as a branch of biology, since it conceives of syntax as the study of linguistic knowledge as embodied in the human [[mind]]. Other linguists (e.g., [[Gerald Gazdar]]) take a more [[Philosophy of mathematics#Platonism|Platonistic]] view, since they regard syntax to be the study of an abstract [[formal system]].&lt;ref&gt;Ted Briscoe, 2 May 2001, [http://www.informatics.susx.ac.uk/research/nlp/gazdar/briscoe/gpsg.html#SECTION00040000000000000000 Interview with Gerald Gazdar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122163306/http://www.informatics.susx.ac.uk/research/nlp/gazdar/briscoe/gpsg.html |date=2005-11-22 }}. Retrieved 2008-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet others (e.g., [[Joseph Greenberg]]) consider syntax a taxonomical device to reach broad generalizations across languages.

=== Generative grammar ===
{{Main|Generative grammar}}
The hypothesis of generative grammar is that language is a structure of the human mind. The goal of generative grammar is to make a complete model of this inner language (known as ''[[i-language]]''). This model could be used to describe all human language and to predict the [[grammaticality]] of any given utterance (that is, to predict whether the utterance would sound correct to native speakers of the language). This approach to language was pioneered by [[Noam Chomsky]]. Most generative theories (although not all of them) assume that syntax is based upon the constituent structure of sentences. Generative grammars are among the theories that focus primarily on the form of a sentence, rather than its communicative function.

Among the many generative theories of linguistics, the Chomskyan theories are:
* [[Transformational grammar]] (TG) (Original theory of generative syntax laid out by Chomsky in ''Syntactic Structures'' in 1957)&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. 1957. ''Syntactic Structures''. The Hague/Paris: Mouton, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Government and binding theory]] (GB) (revised theory in the tradition of TG developed mainly by Chomsky in the 1970s and 1980s)&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1981/1993). Lectures on Government and Binding: The Pisa Lectures. Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Minimalist program]] (MP) (a reworking of the theory out of the GB framework published by Chomsky in 1995)&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1995). The Minimalist Program. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories that find their origin in the generative paradigm are:
* [[Arc pair grammar]]
* [[Generalized phrase structure grammar]] (GPSG; now largely out of date)
* [[Generative semantics]] (superseded by Semantic Syntax &lt;ref&gt;Seuren, P. A. M. 2018. ''Semantic Syntax''. Revised edition. Leiden: Brill&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]] (HPSG)
* [[Lexical functional grammar]] (LFG)
* [[Nanosyntax]]&lt;!--Commenting out until explained: the link seems to be about something unrelated. HPSG and LFG also fall into the category of [[unification]] grammars.--&gt;
* [[Relational grammar]] (RG) (now largely out of date)

=== Dependency grammar ===
{{Main|Dependency grammar}}
[[Dependency grammar]] is an approach to sentence structure where syntactic units are arranged according to the dependency relation, as opposed to the constituency relation of [[phrase structure grammar]]s. Dependencies are directed links between words. The (finite) verb is seen as the root of all clause structure and all the other words in the clause are either directly or indirectly dependent on this root. Some prominent dependency-based theories of syntax are:

* [[Recursive categorical syntax]], or Algebraic syntax
* [[Functional generative description]]
* [[Meaning–text theory]]
* [[Operator grammar]]
* [[Word grammar]]

[[Lucien Tesnière]] (1893–1954) is widely seen as the father of modern dependency-based theories of syntax and grammar. He argued vehemently against the binary division of the clause into [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] that is associated with the grammars of his day (S → NP VP) and which remains at the core of most phrase structure grammars. In the place of this division, he positioned the verb as the root of all clause structure.&lt;ref&gt;Concerning Tesnière's rejection of the binary division of the clause into subject and predicate and in favor of the verb as the root of all structure, see Tesnière (1969:103–105).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Categorial grammar ===
{{Main|Categorial grammar}}
[[Categorial grammar]] is an approach that attributes the syntactic structure not to rules of grammar, but to the properties of the [[syntactic categories]] themselves. For example, rather than asserting that sentences are constructed by a rule that combines a noun phrase (NP) and a verb phrase (VP) (e.g., the [[phrase structure rule]] S → NP VP), in categorial grammar, such principles are embedded in the category of the [[head (linguistics)|head]] word itself. So the syntactic category for an [[intransitive]] verb is a complex formula representing the fact that the verb acts as a [[function word]] requiring an NP as an input and produces a sentence level structure as an output. This complex category is notated as (NP\S) instead of V. NP\S is read as "a category that searches to the left (indicated by \) for an NP (the element on the left) and outputs a sentence (the element on the right)." The category of [[transitive verb]] is defined as an element that requires two NPs (its subject and its direct object) to form a sentence. This is notated as (NP/(NP\S)) which means "a category that searches to the right (indicated by /) for an NP (the object), and generates a function (equivalent to the VP) which is (NP\S), which in turn represents a function that searches to the left for an NP and produces a sentence."

[[Tree-adjoining grammar]] is a categorial grammar that adds in partial [[tree structure]]s to the categories.

=== Stochastic/probabilistic grammars/network theories ===
Theoretical approaches to syntax that are based upon [[probability theory]] are known as [[stochastic grammar]]s. One common implementation of such an approach makes use of a [[neural network]] or [[connectionism]].

=== Functionalist grammars ===
{{main|Functional theories of grammar}}
Functionalist theories, although focused upon form, are driven by explanation based upon the function of a sentence (i.e., its communicative function). Some typical functionalist theories include:
* [[Cognitive grammar]]
* [[Construction grammar]] (CxG)
* [[Emergent grammar]]
* [[Functional discourse grammar]] (Dik)
* [[Prague linguistic circle]]
* [[Role and reference grammar]] (RRG)
* [[Systemic functional grammar]]

'''Text, Speech and Dialogue''' ('''TSD''') is an annual conference involving topics on [[natural language processing]] and [[computational linguistics]]. The meeting is held every September alternating in [[Brno]] and [[Pilsen, Czech Republic]].

The first Text, Speech and Dialogue conference took place in [[Brno]] in 1998.

== Overview ==
TSD series evolved as a prime forum for interaction between researchers in both spoken and written language processing from all over the world. Proceedings of TSD form a book published by [[Springer-Verlag]] in their Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?q=Text%2C+Speech+and+Dialogue+Conference&amp;btnG=Hledat+knihy&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;hl=cs#hl=cs&amp;q=%22International+Conference%2C+TSD%22&amp;tbm=bks TSD proceedings at Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;
TSD Proceedings are regularly indexed by Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index.  Moreover, LNAI series are listed in all major citation databases such as [[DBLP]], [[SCOPUS]], [[Ei Compendex|EI]], [[INSPEC]] or [[COMPENDEX]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/?SGWID=0-102-24-0-0&amp;submit=Submit+Query&amp;sortOrder=pubdateSortdesc&amp;searchType=EASY_CDA&amp;searchScope=editions&amp;queryText=International+Conference%2C+TSD All TSD proceedings at Springer]&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference is organized by the Faculty of Informatics, [[Masaryk University]], [[Brno]], and the Faculty of Applied Sciences, [[University of West Bohemia]], [[Plzeň|Pilsen]].  The conference is supported by [[International Speech Communication Association]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isca-speech.org ISCA webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''theological veto''' is the [[concept]] in [[philosophy of religion]] that [[philosophy]] and [[logic]] are impious and that [[God]], not [[reason]], is sovereign.&lt;ref name="ferre"&gt;[[Frederick Ferré]], ''Basic Modern Philosophy of Religion''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2013}} This concept is held as true by some [[Theism|theists]], especially [[Religious fundamentalism|religious fundamentalists]].

The idea is derived from a belief that mankind is [[Total depravity|depraved]], and its [[intellect]] is a flawed product of this [[Fall of man|fallenness]]. In this view [[religious conversion|conversion]], not reason, is the way to the truth; [[preaching]], not [[argument]], is the way to [[persuasion|persuade]]; and [[divine grace|grace]], not [[evidence]] is the way [[belief]] is confirmed. In this view, natural reason is so profoundly hostile to the divine that holding it above [[faith]] is tantamount to worshiping a sinful creature as an [[idolatry|idol]]. Even the use of [[reason]] on behalf of faith is rejected under the theological veto, as it shows faithlessness. It presupposes by practice that faith can be benefited by reason.

==Usage==
An early use of the phrase is reported from a 1925 critique of opponents of [[evolution]]: "They meet the accumulating evidences of the descent of man with a theological veto. They set the limit to science by the quotation of a verse from the creation legend "Genesis.""&lt;ref&gt;American Ethical Union, ''The Ethical Outlook'', Volume 12, 1925, page 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rejecting the theological veto ==
There are several reasons put forth by those who reject the theological veto. One way to reject the theological veto is to assert that one cannot isolate reason from faith. Intelligible use of language is claimed to commit one to [[consistency]], so to reject reason is to refuse to make sense. This argument asserts that even the theological veto itself must be consistent with itself and inconsistent with reason. Another way the theological veto is rejected is to assert that rejection of critical control over one's beliefs, as for instance by the requirement of evidence, lowers the barrier against [[bigotry]], [[fanaticism]], and [[persecution]]. While its high aspiration is to warn against human [[pride]], some say its supporters are guilty of what they themselves claim is the highest form of pride: They claim that they know the mind of God.&lt;ref name="ferre" /&gt;

'''Thermal Engineering''' is a study of [[Energy transfer|energy transport]] particularly in [[nanoscale]] structure to obtain knowledge and understanding of the scientific effects on physical world that can engineering discoveries in industrial energy applications. The thermal engineering is [[heat transfer]], [[thermodynamics]], [[Energy conservation|energy conversion]], and [[HVAC control system|HVAC applications]].

Thermal engineering may be practiced by [[mechanical engineering|mechanical engineers]] and [[chemical engineering|chemical engineers]].
One or more of the following disciplines may be involved in solving a particular thermal engineering problem: [[Thermodynamics]], [[Fluid mechanics]], [[Heat transfer]], or
[[Mass transfer]].
One branch of knowledge used frequently in thermal engineering is that of [[thermofluids]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="856">The '''torque effect''' experienced in helicopters and single propeller-powered aircraft is an example of [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Newton's Third Law|third law]] of motion that "for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction."

In helicopters, the result of the torque effect is a tendency of the main rotor to want to turn the fuselage in the opposite direction from the rotor. A small tail rotor is the most common configuration to counter the torque effect.

In a single-propeller plane, the result of the torque effect is a tendency of the plane to want to turn upwards and left in response to the propeller wanting to turn (bank) the plane in the opposite direction of the propeller spin.

'''Viral dynamics''' is a field of [[applied mathematics]] concerned with describing the progression of viral infections within a host organism.&lt;ref name="VDbook" &gt;{{cite book |last1=Nowak |first1=Martin |last2=May |first2=Robert |date=2001 |title=Virus Dynamics: mathematical principles of immunology and virology | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Kixhc3IiCy4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=virus+dynamics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9yXeVIHfH4a8yQTipIGYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=virus%20dynamics&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It employs a family of [[mathematical model]]s that describe changes over time in the populations of cells targeted by the virus and the [[viral load]]. These equations may also track competition between different viral strains and the influence of immune responses. The original viral dynamics models were inspired by compartmental [[epidemic model]]s (e.g. the SI model), with which they continue to share many common mathematical features, such as the concept of the [[basic reproduction number|basic reproductive ratio]] (''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). The major distinction between these fields is in the scale at which the models operate: while epidemiological models track the spread of infection between individuals within a population (i.e. "between host"), viral dynamics models track the spread of infection between cells within an individual (i.e. "within host"). Analyses employing viral dynamic models have been used extensively to study [[HIV]],&lt;ref name="VDbook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perelson|first1=Alan S|last2=Ribeiro|first2=Ruy M|title=Modeling the within-host dynamics of HIV infection|journal=BMC Biology|date=2013|volume=11|issue=1|page=96|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-11-96|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/11/96/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hepatitis B virus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nowak|first1=MA|last2=Bonhoeffer|first2=S|last3=Hill|first3=AM|last4=Boehme|first4=R|last5=Thomas|first5=HC|last6=McDade|first6=H|title=Viral dynamics in hepatitis B virus infection|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=1996|volume=93|pages=4398–4402| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/93/9/4398.short|doi=10.1073/pnas.93.9.4398|pmc=39549}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ciupe|first1=SM|last2=Ribeiro|first2=RM|last3=Nelson|first3=PW|last4=Perelson|first4=AS|title=Modeling the mechanisms of acute hepatitis B virus infection|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=2007|volume=247|issue=1|pages=23–35|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.02.017|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519307000938|pmc=1994818}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hepatitis C virus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neumann|first1=A|last2=Lam|first2=NP|last3=Dahari|first3=H|last4=Gretch|first4=DR|last5=Wiley|first5=TE|last6=Layden|first6=TJ|last7=Perelson|first7=AS|title=Hepatitis C Viral Dynamics in Vivo and the Antiviral Efficacy of Interferon-α Therapy|journal=Science|date=1998|volume=282|issue=5386|pages=103–107|doi=10.1126/science.282.5386.103|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/282/5386/103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chatterjee|first1=A|last2=Smith|first2=PF|last3=Perelson|first3=AS|title=Hepatitis C Viral Kinetics: The Past, Present, and Future|journal=Clinics in Liver Disease|date=2013|volume=17|issue=1|pages=13–26|doi=10.1016/j.cld.2012.09.003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1089326112000992|pmc=3584572}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other infections
