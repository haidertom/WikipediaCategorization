'''Agricultural chemistry''' is the study of both [[chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]] which are important in agricultural [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]], the processing of raw [[Product (business)|products]] into foods and beverages, and in [[Natural environment|environmental]] [[Environmental monitoring|monitoring]] and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]]. These studies emphasize the relationships between plants, [[animals]] and [[bacteria]] and their [[Natural environment|environment]].
The science of chemical compositions and changes involved in the production, protection, and use of crops and livestock. As a basic science, it embraces, in addition to test-tube chemistry, all the life processes through which humans obtain food and fiber for themselves and feed for their animals. As an applied science or technology, it is directed toward control of those processes to increase yields, improve quality, and reduce costs. One important branch of it, [[chemurgy]], is concerned chiefly with utilization of agricultural products as chemical [[raw material]]s. Etc.

==Sciences==

The goals of agricultural chemistry are to expand understanding of the causes and effects of biochemical reactions related to plant and animal growth, to reveal opportunities for controlling those reactions, and to develop chemical products that will provide the desired assistance or control. Every scientific discipline that contributes to agricultural progress depends in some way on chemistry. Hence agricultural chemistry is not a distinct discipline, but a common thread that ties together [[genetics]], [[physiology]], [[microbiology]], [[entomology]], and numerous other sciences that impinge on agriculture.

Chemical materials developed to assist in the production of food, feed, and fiber include scores of [[herbicide]]s, [[insecticide]]s, [[fungicide]]s, and other [[pesticide]]s, plant growth regulators, [[fertilizer]]s, and animal feed supplements. Chief among these groups from the commercial point of view are manufactured fertilizers, synthetic pesticides (including herbicides), and supplements for feeds. The latter include both nutritional supplements (for example, [[mineral nutrients]]) and medicinal compounds for the prevention or control of disease.

Agricultural chemistry often aims at preserving or increasing the [[fertility (soil)|fertility of soil]], maintaining or improving the [[agricultural yield]], and improving the quality of the crop.

When agriculture is considered with [[ecology]], the [[sustainablility]] of an operation is considered. Modern agrochemical industry has gained a reputation for [[profit maximization|maximising profits]] while violating sustainable and ecologically viable agricultural principles. [[Eutrophication]], the prevalence of [[genetically modified crops]] and the increasing concentration of chemicals in the food chain (e.g. [[persistent organic pollutant]]s) are only a few consequences of naive [[industrial agriculture]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1651">[[image:Alpha oxidation.svg|Enzymatic steps of alpha oxidation|right|thumb|250px]]
 

==Pathway==
Alpha-oxidation of [[phytanic acid]] is believed to take place entirely within [[peroxisomes]]. 
#[[Phytanic acid]] is first attached to [[Coenzyme A|CoA]] to form [[phytanoyl-CoA]].
#[[Phytanoyl-CoA]] is oxidized by [[phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase]], in a process using Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to yield 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA.
#2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA is cleaved by [[2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase]] in a [[thiamine pyrophosphate|TPP]]-dependent reaction to form pristanal and [[formyl-CoA]] (in turn later broken down into [[formate]] and eventually CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
#Pristanal is oxidized by [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] to form [[pristanic acid]] (which can then undergo [[beta-oxidation]]).
(Propionyl-CoA is released as a result of beta oxidation when the beta carbon is substituted)

==Deficiency==
Enzymatic deficiency in alpha-oxidation (most frequently in [[phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase]]) leads to [[Refsum's disease]], in which the accumulation of [[phytanic acid]] and its derivatives leads to neurological damage. Other disorders of [[peroxisome]] biogenesis also prevent alpha-oxidation from occurring.

The term ''{{lang|la|anno Domini}}'' is [[Medieval Latin]] and means "in the year of the Lord",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Anno%20Domini |title=Anno Domini |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online Dictionary |year=2003 |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |quote=Etymology: Medieval Latin, in the year of the Lord |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is often presented using "our Lord" instead of "the Lord",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Anno+Domini |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=782}} "since AD stands for ''anno Domini'', 'in the year of (Our) Lord'"&lt;/ref&gt; taken from the full original phrase "''anno Domini nostri Jesu Christi''", which translates to "''in the year of our Lord Jesus Christ".

This [[calendar era]] is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the [[annunciation|conception]] or [[Nativity of Jesus|birth]] of [[Jesus of Nazareth]], with ''AD'' counting years from the start of this [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]], and ''BC'' denoting years before the start of the era. There is no [[year zero]] in this scheme, so the year AD&amp;nbsp;1 immediately follows the year 1&amp;nbsp;BC. This dating system was devised in 525 by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] of [[Scythia Minor]], but was not widely used until after 800.&lt;ref name="Teresi1997"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/97jul/zero.htm |authorlink=Dick Teresi |first=Dick |last=Teresi |title=Zero |journal=[[The Atlantic]] |date=July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|pp=778–9}}

The [[Gregorian calendar]] is the most widely used [[calendar]] in the world today. For decades, it has been the unofficial global standard, adopted in the pragmatic interests of international communication, transportation, and commercial integration, and recognized by international institutions such as the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.timeanddate.com/newsletter/all-the-time/a-month-of-sundays5.html |last=Eastman |first=Allan |title=A Month of Sundays |publisher=Date and Time |accessdate=2010-05-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506002355/http://www.timeanddate.com/newsletter/all-the-time/a-month-of-sundays5.html |archivedate=2010-05-06 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, [[English language|English]] followed [[Latin]] usage by placing the "AD" abbreviation before the year number.{{efn|This convention comes from grammatical usage. ''{{lang|la|Anno 500}}'' means "in the year 500"; ''{{lang|la|anno domini 500}}'' means "in the year 500 of Our Lord". Just as "500 in the year" is not good English syntax, neither is 500 AD; whereas "AD 500" preserves syntactic order when translated.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Manual of Style'' 2010, pp. 476–7; Goldstein 2007, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;}} However, BC is placed after the year number (for example: AD&amp;nbsp;{{CURRENTYEAR}}, but 68&amp;nbsp;BC), which also preserves syntactic order. The abbreviation is also widely used after the number of a [[century]] or [[millennium]], as in "fourth century AD" or "second millennium AD" (although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions).&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Manual of Style,'' 1993, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Because BC is the English abbreviation for ''Before Christ'', it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that AD means ''After Death'', i.e., after the death of Jesus. However, this would mean that the approximate 33 years commonly associated with the life of Jesus would neither be included in the BC nor the AD time scales.&lt;ref&gt;Donald P. Ryan, (2000), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Terminology that is viewed by some as being more neutral and inclusive of non-Christian people is to call this the Current or [[Common Era]] (abbreviated as CE), with the preceding years referred to as Before the Common or Current Era (BCE). [[Astronomical year numbering]] and [[ISO 8601]] avoid words or abbreviations related to Christianity, but use the same numbers for AD years.

== History ==
The ''Anno Domini'' dating system was devised in 525 by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] to enumerate the years in his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]]. His system was to replace the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian era]] that had been used in an old [[Easter table]] because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who [[Diocletianic Persecution|persecuted Christians]].{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=767}} The last year of the old table, Diocletian 247, was immediately followed by the first year of his table, AD 532. When he devised his table, [[Julian calendar]] years were identified by naming the [[consul]]s who held office that year—he himself stated that the "present year" was "the consulship of [[Flavius Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]]", which was 525 years "since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161226031734/http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm Nineteen year cycle of Dionysius] Introduction and First Argumentum.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Dionysius implied that [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Jesus' incarnation]] occurred 525 years earlier, without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred. "However, nowhere in his exposition of his table does Dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system, whether consulate, [[Olympiad]], [[Anno Mundi|year of the world]], or [[regnal year]] of Augustus; much less does he explain or justify the underlying date."{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=778}}

[[Bonnie J. Blackburn]] and [[Leofranc Holford-Strevens]] briefly present arguments for 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1 as the year Dionysius intended for the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] or [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]]. Among the sources of confusion are:{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|pp=778–9}}
* In modern times, [[incarnation]] is synonymous with the conception, but some ancient writers, such as [[Bede]], considered incarnation to be synonymous with the Nativity.
* The civil or consular year began on [[1 January]] but the Diocletian year began on 29 August (30 August in the year before a Julian leap year).
* There were inaccuracies in the lists of consuls.
* There were confused summations of emperors' regnal years.

It is not known how Dionysius established the year of Jesus's birth. Two major theories are that Dionysius based his calculation on the Gospel of Luke, which states that Jesus was "about thirty years old" shortly after "the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar", and hence subtracted thirty years from that date, or that Dionysius counted back 532 years from the first year of his new table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Teres|first=Gustav|date=October 1984|title=Time computations and Dionysius Exiguus|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1984JHA....15..177T|journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy|volume=15|issue=3|pages=177-188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tøndering, Claus, ''[http://www.tondering.dk/claus/cal/years.php The Calendar FAQ: Counting years]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0umDqPOf2L8C&amp;pg=PA347|last=Mosshammer|first=Alden A|title=The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era|location=Oxford|date=2009|pages=345-347}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has also been speculated by Georges Declercq&lt;ref&gt;Declercq, Georges, "Anno Domini. The Origins of the Christian Era" Turnhout, Belgium, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was intended to prevent people from believing the imminent [[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]]. At the time, it was believed by some that the [[resurrection of the dead]] and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus. The old ''[[Anno Mundi]]'' calendar theoretically commenced with the [[Dating creation|creation of the world]] based on information in the [[Old Testament]]. It was believed that, based on the ''Anno Mundi'' calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the ''Anno Mundi'' calendar marking the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Wallraff, Martin: Julius Africanus und die Christliche Weltchronik. Walter de Gruyter, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mosshammer, Alden A.: The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era. Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 254, p. 270, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; ''Anno Mundi'' 6000 (approximately AD 500) was thus equated with the resurrection and the end of the world&lt;ref&gt;Declercq, Georges: Anno Domini. The Origins of the Christian Era. Turnhout Belgium. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; but this date had already passed in the time of Dionysius.

=== Popularization ===
The [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] historian the Venerable Bede, who was familiar with the work of Dionysius Exiguus, used ''Anno Domini'' dating in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', completed in 731. In this same history, he also used another [[Latin]] term, ''ante vero incarnationis dominicae tempus anno sexagesimo'' ("in fact in the 60th year before the time of the Lord's incarnation"), equivalent to the English "before Christ", to identify years before the first year of this era.&lt;ref&gt;Bede 731, Book 1, Chapter 2, first sentence.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Dionysius and Bede regarded ''Anno Domini'' as beginning at the incarnation of Jesus, but "the distinction between Incarnation and Nativity was not drawn until the late 9th century, when in some places the Incarnation epoch was identified with Christ's conception, i.e., the Annunciation on March 25" (''Annunciation style'').{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=881}}

On the continent of [[Europe]], ''Anno Domini'' was introduced as the era of choice of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] by the English cleric and scholar [[Alcuin]] in the late eighth century. Its endorsement by Emperor [[Charlemagne]] and [[List of Frankish Kings#Carolingian dynasty|his successors]] popularizing the use of the epoch and spreading it throughout the [[Carolingian Empire]] ultimately lies at the core of the system's prevalence. According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], [[pope]]s continued to date documents according to [[regnal years]] for some time, but usage of AD gradually became more common in [[Roman Catholic]] countries from the 11th to the 14th centuries.&lt;ref name=CathEncy&gt;Patrick, 1908&lt;/ref&gt; In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last [[Western Europe]]an country to [[Spanish era|switch to]] the system begun by Dionysius.&lt;ref name=CathEncy-Chron &gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eastern Orthodox]] countries only began to adopt AD instead of the [[Byzantine calendar]] in 1700 when [[Russia]] did so, with others adopting it in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Although ''Anno Domini'' was in widespread use by the 9th century, the term "Before Christ" (or its equivalent) did not become common until much later. Bede used the expression ''"anno igitur ante incarnationem Dominicam"'' (so in the year before the incarnation of the Lord) twice. ''"Anno an xpi nativitate"'' (in the year before the birth of Christ) is found in 1474 in a work by a German monk.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Rolevinck]] in ''[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/80248064097793506388868/index.htm Fasciculus temporum]'' (1474) used ''Anno an xpi nativitatem'' (in the ...(th) year before the birth of Christ) for all years between [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] and [[Jesus]]. "xpi" is the [[Greek language|Greek]] χρι in Latin letters, which is an abbreviation for ''Christi''. This phrase appears upside down in the centre of [[recto|recto folios]] (right hand pages). From Jesus to [[Pope Sixtus IV]] he usually used ''Anno Christi'' or its abbreviated form ''Anno xpi'' (on [[verso]] folios—left hand pages). He used ''Anno mundi'' alongside all of these terms for all years.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1627, the French [[Jesuit]] [[theologian]] [[Denis Pétau]] (Dionysius Petavius in Latin), with his work ''De doctrina temporum'', popularized the usage ''ante Christum'' (Latin for "Before Christ") to mark years prior to AD.&lt;ref&gt;

===New year===
{{See|New Year}}
When the reckoning from Jesus' incarnation began replacing the previous dating systems in western Europe, various people chose different Christian feast days to begin the year: [[Christmas]], [[Annunciation]], or [[Easter]]. Thus, depending on the time and place, the year number changed on different days in the year, which created slightly different styles in chronology:&lt;ref&gt;[[C. R. Cheney]], [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/99027383.pdf ''A Handbook of Dates, for students of British history''], Cambridge University Press, 1945–2000, pp. 8–14.&lt;/ref&gt;
* From 25 March 753 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]] (today in 1 BC), i.e., notionally from the incarnation of Jesus. That first "Annunciation style" appeared in [[Arles]] at the end of the 9th century, then spread to Burgundy and northern Italy. It was not commonly used and was called ''calculus pisanus'' since it was adopted in [[Pisa]] and survived there till 1750.
* From 25 December 753 AUC (today in 1 BC), i.e., notionally from the birth of Jesus. It was called "Nativity style" and had been spread by Bede together with the ''Anno Domini'' in the early Middle Ages. That reckoning of the Year of Grace from Christmas was used in France, England and most of western Europe (except Spain) until the 12th century (when it was replaced by Annunciation style), and in Germany until the second quarter of the 13th century.
* From 25 March 754 AUC (today in AD 1). That second "Annunciation style" may have originated in [[Fleury Abbey]] in the early 11th century, but it was spread by the Cistercians. [[Florence]] adopted that style in opposition to that of Pisa, so it got the name of ''calculus florentinus''. It soon spread in France and also in England where it became common in the late 12th century and lasted until 1752.
* From Easter, starting in 754 AUC (AD 1). That ''mos gallicanus'' (French custom) bound to a [[moveable feast]] was introduced in France by king [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] (r. 1180–1223), maybe to establish a new style in the provinces reconquered from England. However, it never spread beyond the ruling élite.
With these various styles, the same day could, in some cases, be dated in 1099, 1100 or 1101.

== Birth date of Jesus ==
{{see also|Date of birth of Jesus|Nativity of Jesus#Date of birth|Chronology of Jesus#Year of Jesus' birth}}
The date of birth of Jesus of Nazareth is not stated in the gospels or in any secular text, but most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 BC and 4 BC.&lt;ref name=JDG324 &gt;{{Cite journal | first = James DG | last = Dunn | title = Jesus Remembered | publisher = Eerdmans Publishing | year = 2003 | page = 324}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical evidence is too fragmentary to allow a definitive dating,&lt;ref&gt;Doggett 1992, p579: "Although scholars generally believe that Christ was born some years before AD 1, the historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive dating".&lt;/ref&gt; but the date is estimated through two different approaches – one by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the Nativity accounts in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew, and the second by working backwards from the estimation of the start of the [[ministry of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul &gt;[[Paul L. Maier]] "The Date of the Nativity and Chronology of Jesus" in ''Chronos, kairos, Christos: nativity and chronological studies'' by Jerry Vardaman, Edwin M.

==Other eras==
{{further|Calendar era}}
During the first six centuries of what would come to be known as the Christian era, European countries used various systems to count years. Systems in use included [[List of Roman consuls|consular dating]], imperial [[regnal year]] dating, and [[Anno Mundi|Creation dating]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Although the last non-imperial consul, [[Anicius Faustus Albinus Basilius|Basilius]], was appointed in 541 by Emperor [[Justinian I]], later emperors through [[Constans II]] (641–668) were appointed consuls on the first 1 January after their accession. All of these emperors, except Justinian, used imperial post-consular years for the years of their reign, along with their regnal years.&lt;ref&gt;Roger S. Bagnall and Klaas A. Worp, ''[https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/11125 Chronological Systems of Byzantine Egypt]'', Leiden, Brill, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Long unused, this practice was not formally abolished until Novell XCIV of the law code of [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] did so in 888.

Another calculation had been developed by the [[Alexandria]]n monk [[Annianus of Alexandria|Annianus]] around the year AD 400, placing the Annunciation on 25 March AD 9 (Julian)—eight to ten years after the date that Dionysius was to imply. Although this incarnation was popular during the early centuries of the [[Byzantine Empire]], years numbered from it, an ''Era of Incarnation'', were exclusively used and are yet used, in [[Ethiopia]]. This accounts for the seven- or eight-year discrepancy between the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] and [[Ethiopian calendar]]s. Byzantine chroniclers like [[Maximus the Confessor]], [[George Syncellus]], and [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] dated their years from Annianus' [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the world. This era, called ''[[Anno Mundi]]'', "year of the world" (abbreviated AM), by modern scholars, began its first year on 25 March 5492 BC. Later Byzantine chroniclers used ''Anno Mundi'' years from 1 September 5509 BC, the [[Byzantine calendar|Byzantine Era]]. No single ''Anno Mundi'' epoch was dominant throughout the [[Christian world]]. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in his ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' used an era beginning with the birth of [[Abraham]], dated in 2016 BC (AD 1 = 2017 Anno Abrahami).&lt;ref&gt;Alfred von Gutschmid, ''Kleine Schriften'', F. Ruehl, Leipzig, 1889, p.433.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain and Portugal continued to date by the [[Era of the Caesars]] or [[Spanish Era]], which began counting from 38 BC, well into the Middle Ages. In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last Catholic country to adopt the ''Anno Domini'' system.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt;

The [[Era of Martyrs]], which numbered years from the accession of [[Diocletian]] in 284, who launched the last yet most severe [[persecution of Christians]], was used by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Church of Alexandria]] and is still used, officially, by the Coptic Orthodox and [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholic]] churches. It was also used by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian]] church. Another system was to date from the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], which as early as [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] and [[Tertullian]] was believed to have occurred in the consulate of the Gemini (AD 29), which appears in some [[Middle Ages|medieval]] manuscripts.

The term ''common era'' does not appear in this book; the term ''Christian era'' [lowercase] does appear a number of times. Nowhere in the book is the abbreviation explained or expanded directly.
&lt;/ref&gt; the alternative abbreviations [[Common Era|CE and BCE]], (sometimes written C.E. and B.C.E.) are sometimes used in place of AD and BC.

The "Common/Current Era" ("CE") terminology is often preferred by those who desire a term that does not explicitly make religious references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/ce_info1.htm |author=Robinson, B.A.|title=Justification of the use of "CE" &amp; "BCE" to identify dates.

For example, Cunningham and Starr (1998) write that "B.C.E./C.E. …do not presuppose faith in [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] and hence are more appropriate for [[interfaith dialog]] than the conventional B.C./A.D."&lt;ref name=Cunningham2004&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=ed. by Philip A.|title=Pondering the Passion : what's at stake for Christians and Jews?|year=2004|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|location=Lanham, Md.

The translated term was 西元 ("xī yuán", "Western Era"). Later, in 1949, the [[China|People's Republic of China]] adopted 公元 (''gōngyuán'', "Common Era") for all purposes domestic and foreign.

== No year zero: start and end of a century ==
{{Further|0 (year)|Astronomical year numbering|Millennium|Century}}
In the AD year numbering system, whether applied to the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] or [[Gregorian calendar]]s, AD 1 is preceded by 1 BC. There is no year "0" between them, so a new century begins in a year which has "01" as the final digits (e.g., 1801, 1901, 2001). New millennia likewise are considered to have begun in 1001 and 2001. This is at odds with the common conception that centuries and millennia begin when the trailing digits are zeroes (1800, 1900, 2000, etc.); for example, the [[Millennium celebrations|worldwide celebration of the new millennium]] took place on New Year's Eve 1999, when the year number ticked over to 2000.&lt;ref name="Teresi1997"/&gt;

For computational reasons, [[astronomical year numbering]] and the [[ISO 8601]] standard designate years so that AD 1 = year 1, 1 BC = year 0, 2 BC = year −1, etc.{{efn|To convert from a year BC to [[astronomical year numbering]], reduce the absolute value of the year by 1, and prefix it with a negative sign (unless the result is zero). For years AD, omit the AD and prefix the number with a plus sign (plus sign is optional if it is clear from the context that the year is after the year 0).&lt;ref&gt;Doggett, 1992, p. 579&lt;/ref&gt;}} In common usage, ancient dates are expressed in the Julian calendar, but ISO 8601 uses the Gregorian calendar and astronomers may use a variety of time scales depending on the application. Thus dates using the year 0 or negative years may require further investigation before being converted to BC or AD.

Conversely, the flow of energy and nutrients from [[terrestrial ecosystems]] to [[aquatic ecosystems]] are considered terrestrial subsidies; both aquatic subsidies and terrestrial subsidies are types of [[cross-boundary subsidies]]. 

==Ecological importance of aquatic subsidies==
While the magnitude of aquatic subsidies to terrestrial ecosystems is low compared to those moving in the reverse direction (from terrestrial to aquatic habitats), aquatic subsidies are generally of higher nutritional quality because they come from animal, rather than plant-based or detrital, sources.&lt;ref&gt;Bartels et al. (2012). [https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/11-1210.1 Reciprocal subsidies between freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems structure consumer resource dynamics]. Ecology, 93(5), 1173-1182.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their nutritional value, however, aquatic subsidies are increasingly recognized as important sources of environmental contaminants to terrestrial food webs.&lt;ref&gt;Walters, D.M., Fritz, K.M., Otter, R.R. (2008).[https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/08-0354.1 The dark side of subsidies: adult stream insects export organic contaminants to riparian predators.]. Ecological Applications, 18(8), 1835-1841.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, aquatic animals can accumulate pollutants in their tissues and exoskeletons (such as metals and [[polychlorinated biphenyls]]) and move them to riparian and terrestrial systems as they emerge or are consumed by terrestrial predators.

{{infobox barium}}
'''Barium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''Ba''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;56. It is the fifth element in group 2 and is a soft, silvery [[alkaline earth metal]]. Because of its high chemical [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]], barium is never found in nature as a free element. Its hydroxide, known in pre-modern times as [[Barium hydroxide|baryta]], does not occur as a [[mineral]], but can be prepared by heating barium carbonate.

The most common naturally occurring minerals of barium are [[Baryte|barite]] (now called baryte&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mindat.org/min-549.html |website=www.mindat.org |title=Baryte: Baryte mineral information and data.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nrmima.nrm.se&lt;/ref&gt;) ([[barium sulfate]], BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[witherite]] ([[barium carbonate]], BaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), both insoluble in water. The name ''barium'' originates from the alchemical derivative "baryta", from [[Greek language|Greek]] βαρύς (''barys''), meaning "heavy." ''Baric'' is the adjectival form of barium. Barium was identified as a new element in 1774, but not reduced to a metal until 1808 with the advent of [[electrolysis]].

Barium has few industrial applications.  Historically, it was used as a [[getter]] for [[vacuum tube]]s and in oxide form as the emissive coating on [[Hot cathode#Oxide-coated cathodes|indirectly heated cathodes]]. It is a component of [[Yttrium barium copper oxide|YBCO]] ([[High-temperature superconductivity|high-temperature superconductors]]) and electroceramics, and is added to steel and cast iron to reduce the size of carbon grains within the microstructure. Barium compounds are added to fireworks to impart a green color. [[Barium sulfate]] is used as an insoluble additive to [[oil well]] [[drilling fluid]], as well as in a purer form, as X-ray [[radiocontrast agent]]s for imaging the human gastrointestinal tract. The soluble barium [[ion]] and soluble compounds are poisonous, and have been used as [[rodenticide]]s.

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
[[File:Barium 1.jpg|thumb|left|Oxidized barium]]
Barium is a soft, silvery-white metal, with a slight golden shade when ultrapure.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kresse, Robert |author2=Baudis, Ulrich |author3=Jäger, Paul |author4=Riechers, H. Hermann |author5=Wagner, Heinz |author6=Winkler, Jocher |author7=Wolf, Hans Uwe |chapter=Barium and Barium Compounds |editor=Ullman, Franz |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |date=2007 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |doi=10.1002/14356007.a03_325.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} The silvery-white color of barium metal rapidly vanishes upon [[redox|oxidation]] in air yielding a dark gray [[Barium oxide|oxide]] layer. Barium has a medium [[specific weight]] and good electrical conductivity. Ultrapure barium is very difficult to prepare, and therefore many properties of barium have not been accurately measured yet.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

At room temperature and pressure, barium has a [[body-centered cubic]] structure, with a barium–barium distance of 503 [[picometer]]s, expanding with heating at a rate of approximately 1.8{{e|-5}}/°C.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|2}} It is a very soft metal with a [[Mohs hardness]] of 1.25.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Its melting temperature of {{convert|1000|K|C F}}&lt;ref name="Lide2004"&gt;{{cite book|last = Lide |first= D. R. |title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics |edition = 84th |location = Boca Raton (FL) |publisher = CRC Press |date = 2004 |isbn = 978-0-8493-0484-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4–43}} is intermediate between those of the lighter strontium ({{convert|1050|K|C F|disp=or}})&lt;ref name="Lide2004" /&gt;{{rp|4–86}} and heavier radium ({{convert|973|K|C F|disp=or}});&lt;ref name="Lide2004" /&gt;{{rp|4–78}} however, its boiling point of {{convert|2170|K|C F}} exceeds that of strontium ({{convert|1655|K|C F|disp=or}}).&lt;ref name="Lide2004" /&gt;{{rp|4–86}} The density (3.62&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref name="Lide2004" /&gt;{{rp|4–43}} is again intermediate between those of strontium (2.36&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref name="Lide2004" /&gt;{{rp|4–86}} and radium (~5&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Lide2004" /&gt;{{rp|4–78}}

===Chemical reactivity===
Barium is chemically similar to magnesium, calcium, and strontium, but even more reactive. It always exhibits the oxidation state of +2, except in a few rare and unstable molecular species that are only characterised in the gas phase such as BaF.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Reactions with [[chalcogen]]s are highly [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]] (release energy); the reaction with oxygen or air occurs at room temperature, and therefore barium is stored under oil or in an inert atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Reactions with other [[nonmetal]]s, such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, and hydrogen, are generally exothermic and proceed upon heating.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|2–3}} Reactions with water and alcohols are very exothermic and release hydrogen gas:&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}}
: Ba + 2 ROH → Ba(OR)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↑ (R is an alkyl group or a hydrogen atom)

Barium reacts with [[ammonia]] to form complexes such as Ba(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

The metal is readily attacked by most acids. [[Sulfuric acid]] is a notable exception because [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] stops the reaction by forming the insoluble [[barium sulfate]] on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Müller, Hermann|chapter=Sulfuric Acid and Sulfur Trioxide|editor=Ullman, Franz|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|date=2007|publisher=Wiley-VCH|doi=10.1002/14356007.a03_325.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barium combines with several metals, including [[aluminium]], [[zinc]], [[lead]], and [[tin]], forming [[intermetallics|intermetallic phases]] and alloys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Ferro, Riccardo|author2= Saccone, Adriana|last-author-amp= yes|page=355|title=Intermetallic Chemistry|publisher=Elsevier|date=2008|isbn=978-0-08-044099-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barium salts are typically white when solid and colorless when dissolved, and barium ions provide no specific coloring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=87|title=Qualitative analysis and the properties of ions in aqueous solution|author=Slowinski, Emil J.|author2=Masterton, William L.|publisher=Saunders|date=1990|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-03-031234-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are denser than the [[strontium]] or [[calcium]] analogs, except for the [[halide]]s (see table; [[zinc]] is given for comparison).

[[Barium hydroxide]] ("baryta") was known to alchemists, who produced it by heating barium carbonate. Unlike calcium hydroxide, it absorbs very little CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in aqueous solutions and is therefore insensitive to atmospheric fluctuations. This property is used in calibrating pH equipment.

Volatile barium compounds burn with a green to pale green [[flame test|flame]], which is an efficient test to detect a barium compound. The color results from [[spectral line]]s at 455.4, 493.4, 553.6, and 611.1&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}} &lt;!---BaO forms a peroxide when heated in air.&lt;ref name=O2/&gt;---&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of barium}}

Barium found in the Earth's crust is a mixture of seven primordial nuclides, barium-130, 132, and 134 through 138.&lt;ref name="iso"/&gt; Barium-130 undergoes very slow [[radioactive decay]] to [[xenon]]-130 by double [[Beta decay|beta plus decay]], and barium-132 theoretically decays similarly to xenon-132, with half-lives a thousand times greater than the [[age of the Universe]].&lt;ref name="NUBASE"&gt;{{cite journal| first = Audi| last = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3–128| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center| date = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A.

P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radioactivity of these isotopes is so weak that they pose no danger to life.

Of the stable isotopes, barium-138 composes 71.7% of all barium, and the lighter the isotope, the less abundant.&lt;ref name="iso" /&gt;

In total, barium has about 50 known isotopes, ranging in mass between 114 and 153. The most stable metastable isotope is barium-133 with a half-life of approximately 10.51&amp;nbsp;years.  Five other isotopes have half-lives longer than a day.&lt;ref name="NUBASE" /&gt; Barium also has 10 [[meta state]]s, out of which barium-133m1 is the most stable with a half-life of about 39 hours.&lt;ref name="NUBASE" /&gt;&lt;!---&lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Ba is a standard calibrant for [[gamma-ray]] detectors in nuclear physics studies.---&gt;

==History==
[[File:Humphry Davy Engraving 1830.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Humphry Davy|Sir Humphry Davy]], who first isolated barium metal]]
Alchemists in the early Middle Ages knew about some barium minerals. Smooth pebble-like stones of mineral baryte were found in volcanic rock near [[Bologna]], [[Italy]], and so were called "Bologna stones." Alchemists were attracted to them because after exposure to light they would glow for years.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The phosphorescent properties of baryte heated with organics were described by V. Casciorolus in 1602.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

[[Carl Scheele]] determined that baryte contained a new element in 1774, but could not isolate barium, only [[barium oxide]]. [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]] also isolated [[barium oxide]] two years later in similar studies. Oxidized barium was at first called "barote" by [[Guyton de Morveau]], a name that was changed by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] to ''baryta.'' Also in the 18th century, English mineralogist [[William Withering]] noted a heavy mineral in the lead mines of [[Cumberland]], now known to be [[witherite]]. Barium was first isolated by electrolysis of molten barium salts in 1808 by Sir [[Humphry Davy]] in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;Davy, H. (1808) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=102 Electro-chemical researches on the decomposition of the earths; with observations on the metals obtained from the alkaline earths, and on the amalgam procured from ammonia]," ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', vol. 98, pp. 333–370.&lt;/ref&gt; Davy, by analogy with [[calcium]], named "barium" after baryta, with the "-ium" ending signifying a metallic element.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book| page = 80| url = https://books.google.com/?id=yb9xTj72vNAC| title = The history and use of our earth's chemical elements: a reference guide| author = Krebs, Robert E. | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| date = 2006| isbn = 0-313-33438-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Augustus Matthiessen]] obtained pure barium by electrolysis of a molten mixture of [[barium chloride]] and [[ammonium chloride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1002/jlac.18550930301|title = Masthead|date = 1855|journal = Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie|volume = 93|issue = 3|pages = fmi–fmi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1002/prac.18560670194|title =Notizen|date =1856|last1 =Wagner|first1 =Rud|last2 =Neubauer|first2 =C.|last3 =Deville|first3 =H.

The production of pure oxygen in the [[Brin process]] was a large-scale application of barium peroxide in the 1880s, before it was replaced by electrolysis and [[fractional distillation]] of liquefied air in the early 1900s. In this process barium oxide reacts at {{convert|500|-|600|C|F}} with air to form barium peroxide, which decomposes above {{convert|700|C}} by releasing oxygen:&lt;ref name=O2&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Jensen|first1 = William B.|title = The Origin of the Brin Process for the Manufacture of Oxygen|journal = Journal of Chemical Education|volume = 86|pages = 1266|date = 2009|doi = 10.1021/ed086p1266|issue = 11 |bibcode = 2009JChEd..86.1266J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=34KwmkU4LG0C&amp;pg=PA681|page = 681|title = The development of modern chemistry|isbn = 978-0-486-64235-2|author1 = Ihde, Aaron John|date = 1984-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barium sulfate was first applied as a [[radiocontrast]] agent in [[medical imaging|X-ray imaging]] of the digestive system in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc = 1081520|title = Some Observations on the History of the Use of Barium Salts in Medicine|date = 1974|volume = 18|issue = 1|author=Schott, G.

==Occurrence and production==
The abundance of barium is 0.0425% in the Earth's crust and 13&amp;nbsp;µg/L in sea water. The primary commercial source of barium is baryte (also called barytes or heavy spar), a barium sulfate mineral.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|5}} with deposits in many parts of the world. Another commercial source, far less important than baryte, is witherite, a barium carbonate mineral. The main deposits are located in England, Romania, and the former USSR.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

The baryte reserves are estimated between 0.7 and 2 billion [[tonne]]s. The maximum production, 8.3 million tonnes, was produced in 1981, but only 7–8% was used for barium metal or compounds.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|5}} Baryte production has risen since the second half of the 1990s from 5.6 million tonnes in 1996 to 7.6 in 2005 and 7.8 in 2011. China accounts for more than 50% of this output, followed by India (14% in 2011), Morocco (8.3%), US (8.2%), Turkey (2.5%), Iran and Kazakhstan (2.6% each).&lt;ref&gt;Miller, M. M. [http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/barite/mcs-2012-barit.pdf Barite]. USGS.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

The mined ore is washed, crushed, classified, and separated from quartz. If the quartz penetrates too deeply into the ore, or the iron, zinc, or lead content is abnormally high, then [[froth flotation]]&lt;!--https://books.google.com/books?id=zNicdkuulE4C&amp;pg=PA223--&gt; is used. The product is a 98% pure baryte (by mass); the purity should be no less than 95%, with a minimal content of iron and [[silicon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|7}} It is then reduced by carbon to barium sulfide:&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|6}}
:BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 C → BaS + 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↑

The water-soluble barium sulfide is the starting point for other compounds: reacting BaS with oxygen produces the sulfate, with nitric acid the nitrate, with carbon dioxide the carbonate, and so on.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|6}} The nitrate can be thermally decomposed to yield the oxide.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|6}} Barium metal is produced by reduction with [[aluminium]] at {{convert|1100|C}}. The [[intermetallic compound]] BaAl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is produced first:&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}}
:3 BaO + 14 Al → 3 BaAl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

BaAl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is an intermediate reacted with barium oxide to produce the metal. Note that not all barium is reduced.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}}
:8 BaO + BaAl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Ba&amp;darr; + 7 BaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

The remaining barium oxide reacts with the formed aluminium oxide:&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}}
:BaO + Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → BaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

and the overall reaction is&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}}
:4 BaO + 2 Al → 3 Ba&amp;darr; + BaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

Barium vapor is condensed and packed into molds in an atmosphere of argon.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}} This method is used commercially, yielding ultrapure barium.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Commonly sold barium is about 99% pure, with main impurities being strontium and calcium (up to 0.8% and 0.25%) and other contaminants contributing less than 0.1%.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|4}}

A similar reaction with silicon at {{convert|1200|C}} yields barium and [[barium metasilicate]].&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Electrolysis is not used because barium readily dissolves in molten halides and the product is rather impure.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

===Gemstone===
The barium mineral, [[benitoite]] (barium titanium silicate), occurs as a very rare blue fluorescent gemstone, and is the official state gem of [[California]].

==Applications==

===Metal and alloys===
Barium, as a metal or when alloyed with aluminium, is used to remove unwanted gases ([[getter]]ing) from vacuum tubes, such as TV picture tubes.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Barium is suitable for this purpose because of its low [[vapor pressure]] and reactivity towards oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water; it can even partly remove noble gases by dissolving them in the crystal lattice. This application is gradually disappearing due to the rising popularity of the tubeless LCD and plasma sets.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|4}}

Other uses of elemental barium are minor and include an additive to [[silumin]] (aluminium–silicon alloys) that refines their structure, as well as&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|4}}
* [[bearing alloy]]s;
* lead–tin [[solder]]ing alloys – to increase the creep resistance;
* alloy with nickel for [[spark plug]]s;
* additive to steel and cast iron as an inoculant;
* alloys with calcium, manganese, silicon, and aluminium as high-grade steel deoxidizers.

===Barium sulfate and baryte===
[[File:BariumXray.jpg|thumb|left|[[Amoebiasis]] as seen in a radiograph of a barium-filled colon]]
[[Barium sulfate]] (the mineral baryte, BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is important to the petroleum industry as a [[drilling fluid]] in [[oil well|oil and gas wells]].&lt;ref name="Lide2004" /&gt;{{rp|4–5}} The precipitate of the compound (called "blanc fixe", from the French for "permanent white") is used in paints and varnishes; as a filler in ringing ink, plastics, and rubbers; as a paper coating pigment; and in [[nanoparticle]]s, to improve physical properties of some polymers, such as epoxies.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|9}}

Barium sulfate has a low toxicity and relatively high density of ca. 4.5&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (and thus opacity to X-rays). For this reason it is used as a [[radiocontrast]] agent in [[medical imaging|X-ray imaging]] of the digestive system ("[[barium meal]]s" and "[[Lower gastrointestinal series|barium enemas]]").&lt;ref name="Lide2004" /&gt;{{rp|4–5}} [[Lithopone]], a [[pigment]] that contains barium sulfate and [[zinc sulfide]], is a permanent white with good covering power that does not darken when exposed to sulfides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| page = 102| url = https://books.google.com/?id=uEJHsZWyO-EC| title= Medicinal applications of coordination chemistry| author = Jones, Chris J.| author2 = Thornback, John| last-author-amp = yes | publisher =Royal Society of Chemistry| date = 2007| isbn =0-85404-596-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other barium compounds===

Other compounds of barium find only niche applications, limited by the toxicity of Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions (barium carbonate is a [[rat poison]]), which is not a problem for the insoluble BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

Because of the high reactivity of the metal, toxicological data are available only for compounds.&lt;ref name=bariumtoxic/&gt; Soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect the [[nervous system]], causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], and [[paralysis]].

To avoid a potentially vigorous chemical reaction, barium metal is kept in an argon atmosphere or under mineral oils. Contact with air is dangerous and may cause ignition. Moisture, friction, heat, sparks, flames, shocks, static electricity, and exposure to oxidizers and acids should be avoided. Anything that may contact with barium should be electrically grounded. Anyone who works with the metal should wear pre-cleaned non-sparking shoes, flame-resistant rubber clothes, rubber gloves, apron, goggles, and a gas mask. Smoking in the working area is forbidden. Thorough washing is required after handling barium.&lt;ref name=bariumtoxic/&gt;

The '''Catlin Seaview Survey''', later renamed the '''XL Catlin Seaview Survey''', was a major scientific expedition which commenced in September 2012, whose aim was to document the composition and [[Environmental issues with coral reefs|health]] of [[coral reef]]s worldwide. Specifically, the survey aimed to "carry out a rapid assessment of the current state of coral reef systems and to make this scientific record publicly available for scientists worldwide to use". The survey was sponsored by the [[Catlin Group]] until the survey ended when the Catlin group ended sponsorship. The original team created a film, chasing coral and a new, global initiative known as 50 reefs.&lt;ref name=CSSMain2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Catlin Seaview Survey|url=http://catlinseaviewsurvey.com/|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The survey started in September 2012, and was focused on sections of the [[Great Barrier Reef]] across a range of depths. Specifically, 32 reefs were sampled, which equated to approximately {{convert|150|km}} of reef. This produced around 105,000 images, which are currently being analysed by scientists globally,&lt;ref name=CSSAbout2014&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://catlinseaviewsurvey.com/about|work=Catlin Seaview Survey|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; using image recognition software.&lt;ref name=CSSScience2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Science|url=http://catlinseaviewsurvey.com/science|work=Catlin Seaview Survey|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to imaging shallow reefs, the deeper reef was sampled. This also led to the discovery of the deepest known coral reef in the Great Barrier Reef, which is located at a depth of {{convert|125|m}}.

This initial success led to the continuation of the survey globally. In 2013, the survey focussed on sampling corals in the [[Caribbean sea]] and [[Bermuda]]. Other sites are also being explored in 2014.&lt;ref name="CSSAbout2014"/&gt;

==Surveying==

[[File:Seaview SVII Camera.jpg|thumb|The [[Seaview SVII]] Camera, used extensively throughout the Catlin Seaview Survey.]]

The status of surveyed reefs is being documented using [[Optical resolution|high-resolution]], 360-degree [[Panorama|panoramic]] vision.&lt;ref name='CSSAbout2014'/&gt; These images are [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]-tagged with camera direction recorded, documenting precise locations. This method of documentation is intended to form a visual record of the world's reefs, allowing different reefs to be visually compared, and individual reefs to be monitored over time. This imaging also aims to help both the general public and specific groups (e.g. policy makers) better identify and understand the threats facing coral reefs. Likewise, these images are intended to assist the formation of strategies to protect reefs.

To survey deeper reefs, specialist divers and [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s (ROUVs) are being utilised. The temperatures of these deep reefs are also being monitored. In addition, biological samples are being collected to identify potential genetic links between shallow and deep coral systems, which could be important for conservation. Pulsed Amplitude Modulated (PAM) stress detection devices are also being used in deeper reefs to monitor stress levels.

Much of this imaging was produced using the [[Seaview SVII|SVII Camera]]. The SVII is a self-propelling underwater panoramic camera, and was designed by the survey team. The camera can be controlled by a diver, and is propelled at a constant speed. The Seaview SVII-S has also been designed, and is a lighter, human-propelled version of the SVII which can be transported by a single person. Underwater [[Tablet computer|tablet]]s are used to control the cameras and observe real-time images, and have also been used for communication, especially with [[social media]]. 

As mentioned, ROUVs are used to sample deeper reefs. These are highly mobile, and can operate at low depths. These ROUVs also contain scientific equipment which can be altered depending on the sampling being carried out, and can carry out sampling. As with the low-depth cameras, these ROUVs are able to produce high definition geo-positioned images.&lt;ref name="CSSScience2014"/&gt;

==Catlin Global Reef Record==

Data from the Catlin Seaview Survey has been used to construct the [[Catlin Global Reef Record]], which was launched in 2013. This database contains images and data collected by the Catlin Seaview Survey and by other coral reef research.&lt;ref name="CSSScience2014"/&gt; However, the huge photographic records generated by the Catlin Seaview Survey are the main aspect of this record. The Catlin Global Reef Record is freely available to scientists globally, and can be used to analyse these reef environments and monitor their change.&lt;ref name=GRRHome2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://globalreefrecord.org/home_scientific|work=Global Reef Record|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4940">'''Celibacy syndrome''' ({{lang-ja|セックスしない症候群}}, ''sekkusu shinai shōkōgun'') is a media hypothesis proposing that a growing number of Japanese adults have lost interest in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] and have also lost interest in [[romantic love]], [[dating]] and [[marriage]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/young-people-japan-stopped-having-sex |title=Why have young people in Japan stopped having sex? |publisher=The Guardian |date=20 October 2013 |accessdate=8 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory has been reported by unknown members of "Japan's media" according to journalist Abigail Haworth of ''[[the Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Following the  report, the theory gained widespread attention in English media outlets in 2013,&lt;ref name="news.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/relationships/celibacy-syndrome-hits-japan-with-more-young-people-avoiding-sex/story-fnet0gt3-1226743585472 |title=Celibacy syndrome hits Japan with more young people avoiding sex |publisher=News.com.au |date=21 October 2013 |accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently refuted by several journalists and bloggers.&lt;ref name="yutaaoki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yutaaoki"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yutaaoki.com/blog/top5-mistakes-journalists-make-about-sexless-japan |title=Top 5 Mistakes Journalists Make about Sexless Japan |date=28 October 2013 |accessdate=28 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2013/10/23/are_japanese_people_really_having_less_sex_than_anyone_else.html |publisher=Slate.com |title=No, Japanese People Haven’t Given Up on Sex |date=23 October 2013 |accessdate=28 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="suckers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ampontan.wordpress.com/2012/02/03/suckers/ |title=Suckers |date=3 February 2012 |accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="firstthings"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2013/10/news-flash-yuko-and-hiro-do-not-despise-sex/ |title="Yuko and Hiro" Do Not Despise Sex |date=13 October 2013 |accessdate=28 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washpo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://knowmore.washingtonpost.com/2013/10/23/yes-japanese-people-still-have-sex/ |title=Don’t worry.

==Reports and causes==
In addition to [[celibacy]], the theory cites declining numbers of marriages and declining birthrates in Japan.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;  According to surveys conducted by the Japan Association for Sex Education, between 2011 and 2013, the number of female college students reporting to be [[Virginity|virgins]] increased.  Additionally, surveys conducted by the Japanese Family Planning Association (JFPA) indicated a high number of Japanese women who reported that they "were not interested in or despised sexual contact".&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Meanwhile, surveys conducted by the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research in Japan in 2008 and 2013, revealed that the number of Japanese men and women reporting to not be in any kind of romantic relationship grew by 10%.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="news.com"/&gt;

The theory attributes two possible causes for these reports:  the past two decades of economic stagnation as well as high gender inequality in Japan.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

==Criticism==
One critic accused ''The Guardian'' and other media outlets of using "cherry-picked" data in order to make a sensational claim that appeals to Western notions of a "weird Japan".&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt; Another criticism points to contrary statistics that indicate that Japanese youth are having sex more frequently than ever.&lt;ref name="washpo"/&gt; Additionally, one of the surveys on which the theory is based has been criticized as having a statistically invalid [[Sample size determination|sample size]]. In that survey, only 60 respondents (aged 16 to 19) claimed an aversion to sex, and merely 126 respondents were used to represent the young Japanese population (aged 16 to 19),&lt;ref name="suckers"/&gt; which was nearly 6 million in 2014.&lt;ref name="pop_stats"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/jinsui/tsuki/ |title=Population Estimates by Age (5-Year Age Group) and Sex |date=1 July 2014 |accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another criticism points out that, while the theory conflates sexlessness with low birthrate, these have been demonstrated by others to be uncorrelated.&lt;ref name="yutaaoki"/&gt;

[[File:Starr 060228-8947 Aerial photograph of Hawaii.jpg|thumb|Coconut Isle in Kaneohe Bay]]
'''Coconut Island''', or '''Moku o Lo{{okina}}e''', is a 28-[[acre]] (113,000 m²) island in [[Kāne'ohe Bay]] off the island of [[Oahu]] in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Hawaii]], United States. It is a marine research facility of the [[Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology]] (HIMB) of the [[University of Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology | url = http://www.himb.hawaii.edu/ | accessdate = 2018-08-07  | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1934–1936, [[Chris Holmes II]], an heir to the [[Charles L. Fleischmann|Fleischmann]] yeast fortune, doubled the original {{convert|12|acre|m2|sing=on}} island with coral rubble, sand, and earthen landfill. He established a residence with aquaria, kennels, and aviaries for his many pets. The island was converted to a rest and relaxation station for [[United States Navy]] flyers during [[World War II]].

In 1946 a group of five [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] businessmen, including [[Edwin W. Pauley]], bought the island from the estate of [[Chris Holmes II]] with the idea of converting it to the exclusive Coconut Island Club International, 1946-7, and hired architects [[Paul Williams (architect)|Paul Williams]], [[A. Quincy Jones]], and C.W. Lemmon of Belt Lemmon and Lo, Architects of Honolulu to design a community of cottages, tennis courts, a yacht club and other recreational facilities including remodeling the Holmes mansion and barracks. The Pauley group wanted to develop the island into a private, membership only resort.&lt;ref&gt;Pacific Island Turned into South Sea Paradise", Los Angeles Times, February 17, 1947, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 this idea was dropped and a scaled-back Coconut Island Hotel with accommodation for 32 guests opened in February 1950.

In 1948, Pauley donated a portion of the island to the University of Hawaii to be used as a marine research facility.&lt;ref&gt;Kieger, Moku O Lo'e A History of the Coconut Island, p.215&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1950s to the 1980s, the Pauley family used the island for summer get-aways and hosted many notable guests.  From the mid-80s to mid-90s Japanese real estate investor Katsuhiro Kawaguchi owned the island and permitted the University of Hawaii to use some of its areas for research. In 1995, the Edwin Pauley Foundation granted a gift of $9.6 million to the University of Hawaii Foundation to purchase the private half of the island and build new laboratories on it.

The island is now completely owned by the state and is the facility for the [[Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology]], part of the [[University of Hawaii]]. It is the only U.S. [[laboratory]] built on a [[coral reef]]. (Heron Island, Lizard Island and a number of labs in the South Pacific are located outside of the U.S.)

Coconut Island was used for the opening sequence of the [[television program]] ''[[Gilligan's Island]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.heeiastatepark.org/kayaking-snorkeling | title = Kayaking and Snorkeling: He'eia State Park | publisher = He'eia Learning Center | accessdate = September 14, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2310">The '''coliform index''' is a rating of the purity of [[water]] based on a count of [[feces|fecal]] [[bacteria]]. It is one of many tests done to assure sufficient [[water quality]]. [[Coliform bacteria]] are [[microorganism]]s that primarily originate in the intestines of [[warm-blooded]] animals.  By testing for coliforms, especially the well known ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli''), which is a thermotolerant coliform, one can determine if the water has possibly been exposed to fecal contamination; that is, whether it has come in contact with human or animal feces. It is important to know this because many disease-causing organisms are transferred from human and animal feces to water, from where they can be ingested by people and infect them.   Water that has been contaminated by feces usually contains [[pathogen]]ic bacteria, which can cause disease. Some types of coliforms cause disease, but the coliform index is primarily used to judge if other types of pathogenic bacteria are likely to be present in the water.

The coliform index is used because it is difficult to test for pathogenic bacteria directly.  There are many different types of disease-causing bacteria, and they are usually present in low numbers which do not always show up in tests.  Thermotolerant coliforms are present in higher numbers than individual types of pathogenic bacteria and they can be tested relatively easily.

However, the coliform index is far from perfect.  Thermotolerant coliforms can survive in water on their own, especially in tropical regions, so they do not always indicate fecal contamination.  Furthermore, they do not give a good indication of how many pathogenic bacteria are present in the water, and they give no idea at all of whether there are pathogenic [[virus]]es or [[protozoan|protozoa]] which also cause diseases and are rarely tested for.  Therefore, it does not always give accurate or useful results regarding the purity of water.

A '''complementarity problem''' is a type of [[mathematical optimization]] problem. It is the problem of optimizing (minimizing or maximizing) a function of two [[vector space|vector]] variables subject to certain requirements (constraints) which include: that the [[inner product]] of the two vectors must equal zero, i.e. they are orthogonal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Billups | first1=Stephen | last2=Murty | first2=Katta | title=Complementarity Problems | doi=10.1016/S0377-0427(00)00432-5|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~murty/LCPart.ps | year=2000 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | volume=124 | pages=303| bibcode=2000JCoAM.124..303B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular for finite-dimensional real vector spaces this means that, if one has vectors ''X'' and ''Y'' with all ''nonnegative'' components (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;: in the [[first quadrant]] if 2-dimensional, in the first [[octant (solid geometry)|octant]] if 3-dimensional), then for each pair of components ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; one of the pair must be zero, hence the name ''complementarity''. e.g. ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(1,&amp;nbsp;0) and ''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(0,&amp;nbsp;2) are complementary, but ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(1,&amp;nbsp;1) and ''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(2,&amp;nbsp;0) are not. A complementarity problem is a special case of a [[variational inequality]].

==History==
Complementarity problems were originally studied because the [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions]] in [[linear programming]] and [[quadratic programming]] constitute a [[linear complementarity problem]] (LCP) or a [[mixed complementarity problem]] (MCP). In 1963 [[Carlton E. Lemke|Lemke]] and [[J.T. Howson|Howson]] showed that, for two person games, computing a [[Nash equilibrium]] point is equivalent to an LCP. In 1968 [[Richard W. Cottle|Cottle]] and [[George B. Dantzig|Dantzig]] unified linear and quadratic programming and [[bimatrix game]]s. Since then the study of complementarity problems and variational inequalities has expanded enormously.

Areas of [[mathematics]] and [[science]] that contributed to the development of complementarity theory
include: [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], [[equilibrium point|equilibrium]] problems, [[Variational inequality|variational inequality theory]], [[fixed point theory]], [[topological degree theory]] and [[nonlinear analysis]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2610">'''Cost escalation''can be defined as changes in the cost or price of specific goods or services in a given economy over a period. This is similar to the concepts of [[inflation]] and [[deflation]] except that escalation is specific to an item or class of items (not as general in nature), it is often not primarily driven by changes in the money supply, and it tends to be less sustained. While escalation includes general inflation related to the money supply, it is also driven by changes in technology, practices, and particularly supply-demand imbalances that are specific to a good or service in a given economy. For example, while general inflation (e.g., [[consumer price index]]) in the US was less than 5% in the 2003-2007 time period, steel prices increased (escalated) by over 50% because of supply-demand imbalance. Cost escalation may contribute to a project [[cost overrun]] but it is not synonymous with it.

Over long periods of time, as market supply and demand imbalances are corrected, escalation will tend to more-or-less equal inflation unless there are sustained technology or efficiency changes in a market.

Escalation is usually calculated by examining the changes in [[price index]] measures for a good or service. Future escalation can be forecast using [[econometrics]]. Unfortunately, because escalation (unlike inflation) may occur in a micro-market, and it may be hard to measure with surveys, indices can be difficult to find. For example, the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] has a price index for construction wages and compensation (what the construction contractor's labor cost), but has none for the prices that owners must pay the construction contractor for their services.&lt;ref name="Specialist Groundworks Contractors"&gt;{{cite news | date=2014-01-03 | url=http://www.eks-construction.co.uk| title=Specialist Groundworks Contractors| publisher=Construction Group Association  | author=Paul Henssen| accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cost engineering]] and [[project management]] usage, escalation and [[cost contingency]] are both considered risk funds, that should be included in project estimates and budgets. When escalation is minimal, it is sometimes estimated together with contingency. However, this is not a best practice, particularly when escalation is significant.&lt;ref&gt;"Escalation Estimation: Working With Economics Consultants", John K. Hollmann; Larry R. Dysert, 2007 AACE International Transactions, AACE International, Morgantown, WV, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Electric Power Research Institute''', Inc. or '''EPRI''', is an American independent, [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] organization that conducts research and development related to the [[Electricity generation|generation]], delivery, and use of [[electricity]] to help address challenges in electricity, including reliability, efficiency, affordability, health, safety, and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epri.com/#/about/epri?lang=en|title=EPRI Public Site|website=www.epri.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPRI's principal offices and laboratories are located in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], California; [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], N.C.; [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], TN; and [[Lenox, Massachusetts|Lenox]], MA.

==History==
In November 1965, the [[Northeast blackout of 1965|Great Northeastern Blackout]] left 30 million people in the United States without electricity. Historic in scale and impact, it demonstrated the nation's growing dependence upon electricity and its vulnerability to power loss. The event marked a watershed moment for the U.S. [[Electricity sector of the United States|electricity sector]] and triggered the creation of the Electric Power Research Institute.

Following the blackout, leaders in [[United States Congress|Congress]] held hearings in the early 1970s about the lack of research supporting the power industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mydocs.epri.com/docs/CorporateDocuments/EPRI_Journal/2012-Summer/1025689_Blackout.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819152610/http://mydocs.epri.com/docs/CorporateDocuments/EPRI_Journal/2012-Summer/1025689_Blackout.pdf |archivedate=2016-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Chauncey Starr, then the Dean of the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] [[UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science|School of Engineering and Applied Science]], led the initiative, proposed by Congress, to create an independent research and development organization to support the electricity sector and address its technical and operational challenges. In 1972, at a formal hearing of the [[U.S. Senate Commerce Committee]], Starr presented a vision for the Electric Power Research Institute to serve Congress's mandate for objective, scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barker|first=Brent|date=Summer 2012|title=Born in a Blackout|url=http://mydocs.epri.com/docs/CorporateDocuments/EPRI_Journal/2012-Summer/1025689_Blackout.pdf|journal=EPRI Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starr served as the first President of EPRI for five years and formally retired at age 65, but continued to work at EPRI for the next 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barker|first=Brent|date=Spring 2012|title=The Man Who Never Stopped|url=http://eprijournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1025049_Spring_online.pdf|journal=EPRI Journal|volume=1|pages=14–17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
According to EPRI's 2018 Research Portfolio, EPRI's work encompasses research in technology, the workforce, operations, systems planning and other areas that guide and support the development of new regulatory frameworks, market opportunities, and value to [[energy]] consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epri.com/#/pages/product/000000003002011122/?lang=en|title=2018 Research Portfolio: Research Offerings to Shape the Future of Electricity|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electric motorsport''' (also known as '''electric racing''' or '''electric motor racing''') is a category of motor sport that consists of the racing of electric powered vehicles for competition, either in all-electric series, or in open-series against vehicles with different power trains. Very early in the history of automobiles, electric cars held several performance records over [[internal combustion engine]] cars, such as [[Land speed record#1898.E2.80.931965 .28wheel-driven.29|land speed records]], but fell behind in performance during the first decade of the 20th century. With the renaissance of electric vehicles during the early 21st century, notable electric-only racing series have been developed, for both cars and motorcycles, including for example, the [[FIA Formula E Championship]]. In other racing events, electric vehicles are competing alongside combustion engine vehicles, for example in the [[Isle of Man TT]] and the [[Pikes Peak International Hill Climb]], and in some cases winning outright.

==History==

===Background and early powertrains===
{{Overly detailed|section|date=January 2018}}
[[File:Goldsworthy Gurney steam carriage - Project Gutenberg eText 12496.png|thumb|The [[Goldsworthy Gurney]] [[Steam bus]], in an 1827 illustration.]]
see also: [[History of the steam engine]] and [[Locomotive#Origins|Origins of the locomotive]]

Early mechanically powered vehicles used steam power, a technology first developed for static applications (notably, [[Thomas Newcomen]] 1712 and [[James Watt]] 1765) (see [[History of the steam engine]]). Steam for vehicle traction was taken up both for road vehicles and for rail by [[Richard Trevithick]] who creating the [[Richard Trevithick#Puffing Devil|Puffing devil]] for transporting passengers by road in 1801, and later rail transport, initially for coal (1804) and then for people (Trevethick 1808, [[George Stephenson]] 1824 onwards).  By the 1830s steam began to be more widely adopted for transportation, with steam carriages for road (e.g. the 1827 [[Goldsworthy Gurney]] [[Steam bus]]) and for rail, although the latter quickly became more established for medium and longer distance travel. Mechanically powered road vehicles were largely limited to utilitarian vehicles such as [[traction engine]]s during this period (especially 1850s onwards, see [[History of steam road vehicles#Victorian Age of Steam|History of steam road vehicles]]).

[[File:Thomas Parker Electric car.jpg|thumb|Electric car built by [[Thomas Parker (inventor)|Thomas Parker]] ]]

During the 1860s diverse small experiments with personal transportation and different powertrains blossomed, with steam buggies (e.g. [[History of steam road vehicles#Henry Taylor.27s steam buggy|Henry Taylor]] 1867) and even steam motorcycles ([[History of steam road vehicles#Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede|Michaex-Perreux]] and [[History of steam road vehicles#Sylvester H. Roper|Sylvester Roper]], both around 1867-69). [[Amédée Bollée]] developed several long distance (Le Mans to Paris, 210&amp;nbsp;km) steam vehicles from 1873 onwards, including the 1878 [[Amédée Bollée#La Mancelle|La Mancelle]] of which 50 were produced, and the 1881 [[Amédée Bollée#La Rapide|La Rapide]] capable of 62&amp;nbsp;km/h (39&amp;nbsp;mph). An early electric powertrain was exhibited in November 1881 by French inventor [[Gustave Trouvé]] at the [[International Exposition of Electricity, Paris|International Exhibition of Electricity in Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wakefield|first=Ernest H.|title=History of the Electric Automobile|publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers|year=1994|isbn=978-1-56091-299-6|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English inventor [[Thomas Parker (inventor)|Thomas Parker]], who was responsible for innovations such as electrifying the [[London Underground]], overhead tramways in Liverpool and Birmingham, and the smokeless fuel [[coalite]], built the first production electric car in [[London]] in 1884, using his own specially designed high-capacity rechargeable batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5212278/Worlds-first-electric-car-built-by-Victorian-inventor-in-1884.html  |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |title=World's first electric car built by Victorian inventor in 1884 |date=2009-04-24 |access-date=2009-07-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker's long-held interest in the construction of more fuel-efficient vehicles led him to experiment with electric vehicles. He also may have been concerned about the malign effects [[smoke]] and [[pollution]] were having in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/hybrid-technology/history-of-electric-cars1.htm |title=What is the history of electric cars? |last=Fuller |first=John |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2009-04-09 |access-date=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[petrol engine|petrol/gasoline-powered]] internal combustion engine automobiles were completed almost simultaneously by several German inventors working independently: Karl Benz built his first automobile in 1885 in [[Mannheim]].  Benz was granted a patent for his automobile on 29 January 1886, and began the first production of automobiles in 1888, after [[Bertha Benz]], his wife, had proved - with the first long-distance trip in August 1888, from Mannheim to Pforzheim and back (194&amp;nbsp;km) - that the horseless coach was absolutely suitable for daily use.

Overall, there were a variety of powertrains and vehicle forms experimented with during this period, each with different advantages and disadvantages, range, reliability and speed. In terms of outright performance, different powertrains competed for the land speed record through the turn of the 20th century (see below), and it was not until 1924 onwards that internal combustion powertrains began to dominate this aspect.

===Early land speed records===
[[File:Jamais contente.jpg|thumb|[[La Jamais Contente]] electric, 1899]]
{{Main|Land speed record}}

The table below details the early history of land speed records from 1898 into the early decades of the 20th century. ''[[La Jamais Contente]]'' ({{lang-en|The Never Satisfied}}) was the first road vehicle to go over {{convert|100|km/h}}. It was an [[electric car|electric vehicle]] with a [[light alloy]] [[torpedo]] shaped bodywork and with Fulmen [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]]. The vehicle established the [[land speed record]] on April 29 or May 1, 1899 at [[Achères, Yvelines]] near [[Paris]], [[France]].  The vehicle had two direct drive Postel-Vinay 25&amp;nbsp;kW motors, running at 200 V drawing 124 Amperes each&lt;ref name=pdf1&gt;{{cite web | title= La Jamais Contente | url = http://www.e-mobile.ch/pdf/2005/Fact-Sheet_LaJamaisContente_FW.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EV Zero? |publisher=EV1 Club |url=http://ev1-club.power.net/torpedo.htm |accessdate=2006-10-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012220024/http://ev1-club.power.net/torpedo.htm |archivedate=2006-10-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for about 68&amp;nbsp;hp, and was equipped with [[Michelin]] [[tires]].

As of 1900, 38% of US automobiles, 33,842 cars, were powered by electricity (40% by steam, and 22% by gasoline).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Evolution of Electric Cars |first=Zachary |last=Shahan |publisher=Sustainnovate |url=http://sustainnovate.ae/en/innovators-blog/detail/evolution-of-electric-cars |access-date=2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as combustion powertrains developed, they offered a superior range than electrics, and (especially after the 1908 [[Ford Model T]], and its mass production from 1913 onwards) a much lower purchase price. In 1912 the electric starter motor was invented by [[Charles F. Kettering|Charles Kettering]] leading to easier and faster starting of internal combustion powertrains, and removing what had been perceived as one of their main drawbacks (having to use a hand crank). Electric and subsequently steam still had some performance advantages and dominated the outright speed record until 1924.  Yet the combustion engine technology benefitted from much greater market penetration and thus more development, and began to achieve greater speed performance than electrics and stream from 1924 onwards.

===21st century renaissance===
{{Main|History of the electric vehicle}}
The emergence of higher volume manufacturing of electric powertrain vehicles has allowed for economies of scale and increased research and development of electrical batteries, the critical technology in electric powertrains. Battery power density (the amount of energy stored per unit weight) has typically been the greatest drawback of electric powertrains in comparison to gasoline combustion engine powertrains. Steady advances in battery technology, [[Research in lithium-ion batteries|especially lithium-ion battery technologies]] first commercialized in the early 1990s have driven innovations in electric powertrains, and further battery advances allow them to once again compete with the combustion engine powertrains in motorsports events.

[[Electric drag racing]] is a sport where electric vehicles start from standstill and attempt the highest possible speed over a short given distance.&lt;ref name="0EX1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.0-60mag.com/news/2010/12/cars-peugeot-ex1-sets-new-electric-records/ |title=Concept Or Not, Peugeot EX1 Is One Fast EV |work=0-60mag |date=December 2010|accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sometimes race and usually beat gasoline sports cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MythBuster: Why Electric Vehicles Beat Gas in 5 Extreme Tests |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a3244/4264025/ |publisher=Popular Mechanics |accessdate=2016-05-24 |date=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations such as [[NEDRA]] keep track of records worldwide using certified equipment.

At the [[Formula Student]] competition at the [[Silverstone Circuit]] in July 2013, the electric powered car of the [[ETH Zurich]] won against all cars with internal combustion engines. It is believed to be the first time that an electric vehicle has beaten cars powered by combustion engines in any accredited motorsport competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Electric vehicle storms to victory in Formula Student 2013 |url=http://www.imeche.org/news/archives/2013/07/08/Electric_vehicle_storms_to_victory_in_Formula_Student_2013 |publisher=Institution of Mechanical Engineers |accessdate=2013-07-12 |date=2013-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515111913/http://www.imeche.org/news/archives/2013/07/08/Electric_vehicle_storms_to_victory_in_Formula_Student_2013 |archivedate=2016-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, an electric car won all places of the [[Pikes Peak International Hill Climb]]. Also in that year the second place on all classes was won by an electric car. Already in 2014, electric cars had won second and third place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gizmag.com/electric-cars-pikes-peak-winner/38214/ |title=Electric power lights up Pikes Peak |first=Scott |last=Collie |work=GizMag |location=Australia |date=2015-06-29 |access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.9news.com/story/sports/2015/06/28/pikes-peak-hill-climb-rhys-millen-electric-car/29437641/ |title=Electric car wins title at Pikes Peak race |work=9News |location=US |date=2015-06-29 |access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2015/06/28/2015-pikes-peak-hill-climb-results/ |title=Rhys Millen wins Pikes Peak under all-electric power |first=Domenick |last=Yoney |work=AutoBlog |location=US |date=2015-06-28 |access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, a pure electric car participated in the [[Paris-Dakar Rally]] and completed the entire route of {{convert|9000|km|mi|abbr=on}} through Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia. The vehicle had been specially designed and built for the race. The car had a 250&amp;nbsp;kW engine (340&amp;nbsp;hp) and a 150 kWh battery. The battery consisted of several modules.

===Pikes Peak International Hill Climb===
{{main|Pikes Peak International Hill Climb}}

The [[Pikes Peak International Hill Climb]], also known as ''The Race to the Clouds'', is an annual automobile and motorcycle [[Hillclimbing|hillclimb]] to the summit of [[Pikes Peak]] in Colorado, USA. The track measures {{convert|12.42|mi|km}} over 156 turns, climbing {{convert|4720|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the start at Mile 7 on Pikes Peak Highway, to the finish at {{convert|14110|ft|m|abbr=on}}, on grades averaging 7.2%.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;''PPIHC race overview'', {{cite web |url=http://www.ppihc.com/2014-spectator-guide/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727131916/http://www.ppihc.com/2014-spectator-guide/ |archivedate=2014-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The race is self sanctioned and has taken place since 1916, making it the second oldest motorsport event in the Western Hemisphere behind the Indianapolis 500.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt; It is currently contested by a variety of classes of cars, trucks, motorcycles and quads. There are often numerous new classes tried and discarded year-to-year. In the modern era, electric vehicles have competed in the event since 1983 (Joe Balls, Sears Electric car). In the 2-wheeled divisions, the electric powertrains are already able to outcompete the combustion engines; the 2013 overall winner was an electric bike, the [[Lightning Motorcycle]] [[Lightning LS-218|LS-218 electric Superbike]] ridden by Carlin Dunne in a time of 10:00.694 minutes, a new course record for the 2-wheeled class.

In the 4-Wheeled Divisions, the results of recent years show that the relative improvements in race time are advancing at different rates in the electric classes compared to the unlimited/combustion engine classes. Unlimited class vehicles, with combustion engines, broke the 16 minute barrier in 1938, and have steadily improved over the subsequent decades, breaking the 10-minute barrier in 2011.&lt;ref name="ppihc.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ppihc.com/race_winners_by_year/ |title=Race winners by year |website=Pikes Peak International Hill Climb |access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the electric vehicle class broke the 16 minute barrier in 1994 (Katy Endicott, Honda Civic Shuttle finishing in 15:44:71 minutes), and the 10-minute barrier in 2013 (Nabuhiro 'Monster' Tajima, E-Runner finishing in 9:46:53 minutes).&lt;ref name="ppihc.com"/&gt; In the 2014 event, the Mitsubishi team ([[Mitsubishi MiEV Evolution|MiEV Evolution III]]) achieved 2nd (Greg Tracey, 9:08.188 minutes) and 3rd position (Hiroshi Masuoka, 9:12:204 minutes) - within 3 seconds and 7 seconds (respectively) of the overall fastest vehicle, a gasoline powered Norma race car.&lt;ref name="LiveTiming.net PPIHC results"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://livetiming.net/ppihc/?Class= |website=Live Timing |publisher=North Country Timing &amp; Scoring and LiveTiming.net |location=US |access-date=2014-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716194314/http://livetiming.net/ppihc/?Class= |archivedate=2014-07-16 |df= |title=Pikes Peak International Hill Climb 2018&lt;br&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The graph to the right shows the relative rates of improvement of these two classes since the 1980s.

2015 for the first time in the history of the race was an electric car to win the race outright. The winning car was the Latvian team [[Drive eO]]'s 3rd generation vehicle, eO PP03 with peak power of 1020&amp;nbsp;kW and peak torque of 2160 Nm, weighing 1200&amp;nbsp;kg. The time achieved was 9:07.222 minutes, just faster than Greg Tracey's 9:08.188 time in 2014. Second place was also earned by an electric car, the Tajima [[Rimac Automobili]] [[Rimac E-Runner Concept One|E-Runner Concept_One]] with peak power of 1100&amp;nbsp;kW, peak torque of 1500 Nm, and weighing 1500&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.electricautosport.com/2015/06/tajima-and-rimac-reveal-1100kw-electric-pikes-peak-racer-photos-and-specs/ |title=Tajima and Rimac reveal 1100kW electric Pikes Peak racer + photos and specs |first=Tim |last=Biesbrouck |work=Electric Autosport |date=2015-06-01 |access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winning driver [[Rhys Millen]] said in an interview that the vehicle had lost half its tractive power (due to heat) from around the halfway point. Based on testing the team had expected a run 30 seconds faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMjsAMlXGBI |title=Rhys Millen Wins Pikes Peak First Electric Car Victory |via=YouTube |access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the two above teams and drivers raced again in 2016, with evolutions of the vehicles, and were joined by a prototype '4-motor EV' from Acura based on the 2016 NSX production car, with heavy modifications to all-electric drive. The Acura, driven by Tetsuya Yamano, achieved a remarkable time for its first outing, finishing in 9:06:015 minutes, and third place overall. [[Drive eO]]'s 4th generation vehicle, eO PP100 achieved a time of 8:57:118 minutes, improving on the previous year's time and coming second overall. The winning 2016 vehicle was a combustion engine Norma driven by [[Romain Dumas]] with a time 8:51:445 minutes. The Norma has similar power to weight ratio to the PP100, but weighs half as much and as a result has better traction in corners. Dumas' team also won in an earlier version of the same vehicle in 2014 with a time of 9:05:801 minutes, thus improving by some 14 seconds over 2 years technological evolution. The Drive eO vehicle improved by some 10 seconds in one year, over its 2015 time.

In 2018, the outright winner was the all electric I.D. R Pikes Peak Prototype driven by Romain Dumas, in new overall record time 7:57.148 minutes. The previous track record stood at 8:13.878 minutes, driven by Sébastien Loeb in the 2013 [[Peugeot 208]] T16 Pikes Peak. Now that electrics have overtaken the performance of gasoline cars on Pike's Peak, it seems likely that electric cars will continue to dominate this race from 2018 onwards. Electric cars are still relatively early in their motorsport development with much room for further improvement, whereas gasoline powered cars have had over a century of development, with only incremental improvements likely to come in the future.

===Isle of Man TT===
{{main|Isle of Man TT|TT Zero}}

TT Zero is part of the [[Isle of Man TT]] and races for 1 lap (37.733 miles) of the [[Snaefell Mountain Course]]. The TT Zero event as an officially sanctioned [[Isle of Man TT]] race is for [[racing motorcycle]]s where "''The technical concept is for motorcycles (two wheeled) to be powered without the use of carbon based fuels and have zero toxic/noxious emissions''."&lt;ref&gt;''REGULATIONS TT ZERO – 2010 International Tourist Trophy – Isle of Man 29 May – 11 June'' p27 ACU Events Ltd (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural 2010 TT Zero race was won by [[Mark Miller (TT motorcycle racer)|Mark Miller]] riding a [[MotoCzysz E1pc]] motor-cycle in 23 minutes and 22.89 seconds at an average race speed of 96.820&amp;nbsp;mph for 1 lap (37.733 miles) of the Mountain Course and the first [[United States]] winner since Dave Roper won the 1984 Historic TT riding a 500cc [[Matchless]]. The TT Zero race replaced the [[TTXGP]] franchise with the simplification of the regulations&lt;ref&gt;''Isle of Man Tourist Trophy Races – Official Programme May 29–11 June 2010'' page 14 Isle of Man Department of Community, Culture &amp; Leisure – ACU Events Ltd (2010) Mannin Media Group Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; and the emphasis on electric powered motor-cycles.&lt;ref&gt;''REGULATIONS TT ZERO – 2010 International Tourist Trophy – Isle of Man 29 May – 11 June'' Appendix C page 25–27 ACU Events Ltd (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[MotoCzysz]] [[MotoCzysz E1pc|E1pc]] was also the first [[United States|American]] manufactured motor-cycle to win an Isle of Man TT Race since Oliver Godfrey won the [[1911 Isle of Man TT|1911]] [[Senior TT]] with an [[Indian (motorcycle)|Indian]] V-Twin motor-cycle.

The riders of the TT Zero bikes are typically those that also compete in the combustion engine classes and are very experienced on the circuit. Comparing the experience of the different powertrains, Lee Johnston said as he climbed off his electric bike in the 2015 practice sessions: “That was just mint. It feels so stable, it’s unbelievable. It’s just so peaceful. No revving.” Asked for what was memorable, he responded “I think just the peace and quiet and riding over the mountain, no noise and seeing the sunset..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cycleworld.com/2015/06/06/iomtt-victory-motorcycles-tt-qualifying-report/ |title=Victory Racing Breaks the 100mph Average Lap Speed Barrier on its First TT Practice Session |work=Cycle World |location=US |date=2015-06-06 |access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TT Zero lap speeds have been improving at an average rate of around 2&amp;nbsp;mph in recent years (121.824&amp;nbsp;mph as of 2018). With more mature technology, the combustion engine bikes' [[Isle of Man TT#Fastest race lap by year|lap speeds]] in the mainstream TT have been improving at a lower rate of around 1&amp;nbsp;mph each year in recent years (135.452&amp;nbsp;mph as of 2018). It's likely that the electric bikes will surpass the combustion bikes at some point, but it may not happen until the mid to late 2020s.

===FIA World Endurance Championship===
[[File:Nissan Zeod RC.JPG|thumb|Nissan ZEOD RC, first electric vehicle to complete a lap of Le Mans]]
{{main|FIA World Endurance Championship}}

The [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] is an [[auto racing]] [[world championship]] organized by the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO) and sanctioned by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA).  The series usurps the ACO's former [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]] which began in [[2010 Intercontinental Le Mans Cup|2010]], and is the first endurance series of world championship status since the demise of the [[World Sportscar Championship]] at the end of [[1992 World Sportscar Championship season|1992]].  The World Endurance Championship name was previously used by the FIA from [[World Sportscar Championship|1981 to 1985]].

The series feature multiple classes of cars competing in [[endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance races]], with [[sports prototype]]s competing in the [[Le Mans Prototype]] categories, and production-based [[grand tourer]]s competing in the [[LM GTE]] categories.  World champion titles are awarded to the top scoring manufacturers and drivers over the season,&lt;ref name="FIA WEC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/fiasport/2011/Pages/fia-wec.aspx | title = 2012 FIA World Endurance Championship | publisher = [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] | work = fia.com | date = 2011-06-03 | accessdate = 2011-06-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606063434/http://fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/fiasport/2011/Pages/fia-wec.aspx | archivedate = 2011-06-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FIA WMSC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/wmsc/2011/Pages/wmsc-030611.aspx | title = World Motor Sport Council | publisher = [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] | work = fia.com | date = 2011-06-03 | accessdate = 2011-06-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606063414/http://www.fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/wmsc/2011/Pages/wmsc-030611.aspx | archivedate = 2011-06-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while other cups and trophies will be awarded for drivers and [[privateer (motorsport)|private teams]].&lt;ref name="ACO WEC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lemans.org/en/races/24h/update/The-FIA-World-Endurance-Championship-is-unveiled--_4068.html | title = The FIA World Endurance Championship is unveiled! | publisher = [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] | work = lemans.org | date = 2011-06-09 | accessdate = 2011-06-09 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110616155004/http://www.lemans.org/en/races/24h/update/The-FIA-World-Endurance-Championship-is-unveiled--_4068.html | archivedate = 2011-06-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nissan ZEOD RC]] was designed by Ben Bowlby, who previously designed the [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans|2012]] Garage 56 entry [[DeltaWing]] as an employee for DeltaWing Project 56 LLC, a consortium led by Don Panoz. He previously worked for DeltaWing LLC, a Chip Ganassi company created to develop a DeltaWing concept race car for IndyCar. Nissan provided an engine and received naming rights on the Garage 56 entry at the 2012 Le Mans race, as well as and other 2012 American Le Mans Series races

The ZEOD RC had a [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid electric drivetrain]] with [[lithium ion]] battery packs in a chassis similar in design to the DeltaWing.&lt;ref name="ZEOD RC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/108176/ |title=Nissan unveils electric Le Mans Garage 56 car |publisher=[[Haymarket Press]] |work=[[Autosport]] |last=O'Leary |first=Jamie |date=2013-06-21 |accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a June 22, 2013 article at Autosport.com, Bowlby said: "This is a new car, but it uses the narrow track technology of the DeltaWing and that gives us great efficiency. It is something we understand and it is an efficient way of getting around Le Mans."

At the [[2014 24 Hours of Le Mans]], the car had to retire during the race's early hours due to a gearbox failure. However it managed to achieve its goals of reaching a speed above 300&amp;nbsp;km/h and completing a lap in [[Circuit de la Sarthe|Le Mans]] using electric power only.

===Rally Paris-Dakar===
{{main|Dakar Rally}}

In January [[2017 Dakar Rally|2017]], a pure electric car participated in the Paris-Dakar Rally and completed the entire route of 9000&amp;nbsp;km through Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia. The vehicle had been specially designed and built for the race. The car had a 250&amp;nbsp;kW engine (340&amp;nbsp;hp) and a 150 kWh battery. The battery consisted of several modules. Each module could be charged separately by power cable to speed up the charging process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://oekonews.at/?mdoc_id=1112013 |title=Dakar Rallye: Erstmals 100% elektrisch im Ziel |trans-title=Dakar Rallye: First 100% electric in the finish |work=oekonews [[Süddeutsche Zeitung|Süddeutschen Zeitung]] |date=2017-01-17 |access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Targa West]] in Western Australia has featured an Electric Vehicle since 2016 and has several road registered Electric Vehicles competing in the Targa South West and Quit Targa West 2018.

===MotoE World Cup===
{{main|MotoE World Cup}}
The [[MotoGP]] motorcycle world championship will have an all-electric support series called ''MotoE World Cup'' by [[2019 MotoGP season|2019]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/129290|title=MotoGP plans support championship for electric bikes by 2019|publisher=autosport.com|date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future prospects==

Electric powertrains have advantages over combustion engines in power delivery and vehicle dynamics (especially on motorbikes), but still have range disadvantages in longer races (note that combustion engine vehicle often have to refill energy supply also, e.g. Isle of Man TT bikes refill every two laps). Early electric challengers to combustion engine vehicles are therefore typically in shorter more intensive races such as hill climbs or other limited distance races, or simply in fastest lap times (e.g. around the Isle of Man Snaefell circuit). Nevertheless, for endurance racing, hybrid electric powertrains have also proven their advantages over pure combustion engine powertrains, with recent years at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] all won by the hybrid electric [[Audi R18 e-tron quattro]].

'''Energetic neutral atom''' ('''ENA''') imaging, often described as "seeing with [[atoms]]", is a technology used to create global images of otherwise invisible phenomena in the [[magnetospheres]] of [[planets]] and throughout the [[heliosphere]], even to its outer boundary.
This constitutes the far-flung edge of the [[solar system]].&lt;ref name=BrandtMitchell&gt;{{cite journal

The [[solar wind]] consists of ripped-apart atoms (called [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]) flying out of the Sun. This is mostly [[hydrogen]], that is, bare [[electrons]] and [[protons]], with a little bit of other kinds of [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]], mostly [[helium]]. The [[interstellar medium|space between solar systems]] is similar, but they come from other stars in our [[galaxy]]. These charged particles can be redirected by [[magnetic fields]]; for instance, [[Earth]]'s magnetic field shields us from these particles. Every so often, a few of them steal electrons from neutral atoms they run into, making them neutral and not subject to large-scale electromagnetic fields. Still moving very fast, they tend to travel mostly in a straight line, subject to gravity. These are called '''Energetic Neutral Atoms'''. ENA images are constructed from the detection of these energetic neutral atoms.&lt;ref name=Gruntman97&gt;{{cite journal

This region of "[[space weather]]" is the site of [[geomagnetic storms]] that disrupt communications systems and pose [[radiation]] hazards to humans traveling at high polar altitudes or in orbiting spacecraft. A deeper understanding of this region is vitally important. Geomagnetic weather systems have been late to benefit from the [[satellite]] imagery taken for granted in weather forecasting, and space physics because their origins in magnetospheric [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]] present the added problem of invisibility.&lt;ref name=BrandtMitchell/&gt;

The [[heliosphere]] protects the entire Solar System from the majority of [[cosmic rays]] but is so remote that only an imaging technique such as ENA imaging will reveal its properties. The heliosphere's structure is due to the invisible interaction between the solar wind and cold gas from the local [[interstellar medium]].&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt;

The creation of ENAs by space plasmas was predicted but their discovery was both deliberate and serendipitous. While some early efforts were made at detection, their signatures also explained inconsistent findings by ion detectors in regions of expected low ion populations. Ion detectors were co-opted for further ENA detection experiments in other low-ion regions.&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt; However, the development of dedicated ENA detectors entailed overcoming significant obstacles in both skepticism and technology.&lt;ref name=BrandtMitchell/&gt;

Although ENAs were observed in space from the 1960s through 1980s,&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt; the first dedicated ENA camera was not flown until 1995 on the Swedish [[Astrid (satellite)|Astrid-1]] satellite,&lt;ref name=Brandt2001&gt;

==Creation of ENAs==
The most abundant ion in space plasmas is the [[hydrogen ion]]—a bare proton with no excitable electrons to emit visible photons.  The occasional visibility of other plasma ions is not sufficient for imaging purposes.&lt;ref name=BrandtMitchell/&gt;  ENAs are created in charge-exchange collisions between hot solar plasma ions and a cold neutral background gas.  These charge-exchange processes occur with high frequency in planetary magnetospheres and at the edge of the heliosphere.&lt;ref name=OHBP&gt;{{cite web

===Charge exchange===
[[File:Gruntman ena 01.jpg|thumb|350px|A hot plasma [[ion]] 'steals' charge from a cold neutral [[atom]] to become an '''E'''nergetic '''N'''eutral '''A'''tom ('''ENA''')&lt;ref name=GrunDiagram&gt;{{cite web

In a '''charge-exchange collision''' between a high energy plasma ion and a cold neutral atom, the ion 'steals' electrons from the neutral atom, producing a cold ion and an '''energetic neutral atom'''(ENA).

&lt;big&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

where
*    I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  plasma ion
*    A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  background neutral atom (lower energy)
*    A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  energetic neutral atom (ENA)
*    I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  lower energy ion

Species 1 and 2 may be the same or different and an exchange of two electrons is possible, e.g.
[[File:Gruntman ena 02.jpg|thumb|350px |The ENA leaves the charge exchange in a straight line with the velocity of the original plasma ion.&lt;ref name=GrunDiagram/&gt;]]
&lt;big&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H → H + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Proton–hydrogen charge-exchange&lt;br /&gt;
or&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;He&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;  + He  →   He  + He&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
alpha-helium charge-exchange.&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt;

Due to its [[Electric charge|charge]] [[Neutral particle|neutrality]], the resulting ENA is subject to [[gravitation]]al forces only.  Because gravitation influences can normally be ignored, it is safe to assume that the ENA preserves the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] [[momentum]] of the original pre-interaction plasma ion.&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt;

Some ENAs are lost in further charge-exchange, electron collisions and [[photoionization]], but a great many travel very long distances in space completely undisturbed.&lt;ref name=OHBP/&gt;

Although [[plasma recombination]] and neutral atom acceleration by the solar gravitation may also contribute to an ENA population under certain conditions, the main exception to this creation scenario is the [[flux]] of [[interstellar gas]], where neutral particles from the local [[interstellar medium]] penetrate the heliosphere with considerable velocity, which classifies them as ENAs as well.&lt;ref name=OHBP/&gt;

===Species of ENAs===
Proton–hydrogen charge-exchange collisions are often the most important process in space plasma because [[Hydrogen]] is the most abundant constituent of both plasmas and background gases and hydrogen charge-exchange occurs at very high [[velocity|velocities]] involving little exchange of [[momentum]].

In general, only a few species are important for ENA formation, namely [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], [[oxygen]] and [[sulfur]]:
* Atomic hydrogen dominates Earth's neutral particle environment from altitudes of 600&amp;nbsp;km to 1000&amp;nbsp;km ([[solar minimum]] - maximum.)
* The interstellar and solar winds are mainly protons with the solar wind also containing ~5% alpha particles (He&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; )
* Helium and oxygen are also important Earth species.
* Planetary magnetospheric plasma consists mostly of protons with some helium and oxygen.
* Jupiter's magnetosphere contains sulfur ions as well, due to volcanic activity its moon Io.&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt;
&lt;!-- ASK WHAT HAPPENS TO SOLAR WIND ELECTRONS --&gt;

===Background gases===
The corresponding neutral gases are:
* the [[geocorona]] for the Earth's magnetosphere
* a planetary [[exosphere]] for a planetary magnetosphere
* the local [[interstellar medium]] in the boundary region of the heliosphere at the [[termination shock]] and the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]].&lt;ref name=OHBP/&gt;

===Energies===
[[File:ENA Energies.jpg|thumb|500px|ENA energies are categorized according to instrumentation, not the ENA source&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt;&lt;ref name=OHBP/&gt;&lt;ref name=IMAGE2&gt;{{cite web
| title= IMAGE NAI Instrumentation
| website=Southwest Research Institute| year=2000
| url=http://pluto.space.swri.edu/IMAGE/NAI_instrument.html
| accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
ENAs are found everywhere in space&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt; and are directly observable at energies from 10[[electron volt|eV]] to more than 1 M[[electron volt|eV]].&lt;ref name=OHBP/&gt;  Their energies are described more with reference to the instruments used for their detection than to their origins.

No single particle analyzer can cover the entire energy interval from 10 [[electron volt|eV]] to beyond 1 M[[electron volt|eV]]. ENA instruments are roughly divided into low, medium and high overlapping groups that can be arbitrary and vary from author to author.  The low, medium and high energy range from one author is shown in the graph&lt;ref name=OHBP/&gt; along with the energy ranges for the three instruments aboard the IMAGE satellite:
* a high energy instrument, HENA measuring 10-500 keV energy to study Earth's [[ring current]];
* a medium ENA instrument, MENA measuring  1-30 keV to study the [[plasma sheet]]; and
* a low ENA instrument measuring between 10 eV and 500 eV to study the ionospheric source of ions flowing from the polar cap.&lt;ref name=IMAGE2/&gt;

Atoms are usually considered ENAs if they have [[Kinetic energy|kinetic energies]] clearly higher than can be reached by typical [[thermodynamic]] planetary [[atmospheres]] which is usually in excess of 1 eV. This classification is somewhat arbitrary, being driven by the lower limits of ENA measurement instrumentation.  The high end limitations are imposed by both measurement techniques and for scientific reasons.&lt;ref name=OHBP/&gt;

==Magnetospheric ENA imaging==
Magnetospheres are formed by the solar wind plasma flow around planets with an intrinsic [[magnetic field]] ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Earth]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]), although planets and moons lacking magnetic fields may sometimes form magnetosphere-like plasma structures.&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt; The ionospheres of weakly magnetized planets such as [[Venus]] and [[Mars]] set up currents that partially deflect the solar wind flow around the planet.&lt;ref name=BrandtMitchell/&gt;

Although magnetospheric plasmas have very low densities; e.g. near Jupiter's moon Europa, plasma pressures are about 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; bar, compared to 1 bar at Earth's surface,&lt;ref name=RHPMH&gt;{{cite journal|title=Recent Research Highlights from Planetary Magnetospheres and the Heliosphere |author1=Paranicas, C.P. |author2=Decker, R.B. |author3=Williams, D.J. |author4=Mitchell, D.G. |author5=Brandt, P.C. |author6=Mauk, B.H. |journal=Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest |volume=26 |issue=2 |year=2005 |url=http://www.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/td2602/Paranicas.pdf |accessdate=2009-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911205241/http://www.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/td2602/Paranicas.pdf |archivedate=September 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are responsible for magnetospheric dynamics and emissions.  For example, [[geomagnetic storms]] create serious disturbances in Earth's cable communications systems, navigational systems and power distribution systems.

The strength and orientation of the magnetic field with respect to solar wind flow determines the shape of the [[magnetosphere]].  It is usually compressed on the day side and elongated at the night side.&lt;ref name=OHBP/&gt;

===Earth's magnetosphere===
Earth's magnetic field dominates the terrestrial magnetosphere and prevents the solar wind from hitting us head on.  Lacking a large protective magnetosphere, Mars is thought to have lost much of its former oceans and atmosphere to space in part due to the direct impact of the solar wind.  Venus with its thick atmosphere is thought to have lost most of its water to space in large part owing to solar wind ablation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar wind would singe our atmosphere if not for our magnetic field |author=F.

[[File:ISEE-1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|ISEE 1 data validated concept of ENA magnetospheric mapping in 1982&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt;]]
Understanding the magnetosphere increased in importance with the realization of the detrimental impact of geomagnetic storms, caused by solar [[coronal mass ejections]], particularly in years of high solar activity.  In addition to long known effects on Earth's cable communication systems, communications, broadcasting, navigation and security applications are increasingly dependent on satellites.  Most of these satellites are well within the protective magnetosphere but are vulnerable to space weather systems that affect them adversely.  There are also radiation hazards for humans traveling at high polar altitudes or in orbiting spacecraft&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt;  Many countries, including the U.S., provide a Space Weather Service reporting existing or predicted Geomagnetic Storms, Solar Radiation Storms and Radio Blackouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====ENA detection in Earth's magnetosphere====
The first dedicated ENA instrument was launched on a Nike–Tomahawk sounding rocket from Fort Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. This experiment was followed by the launch of a similar instrument on a Javelin sounding rocket in 1970 to an altitude of 840&amp;nbsp;km at Wallops Island off the coast of Virginia.  In 1972 and 1973, the presence of ENA signatures explained inconsistencies in measurements by the IMP-7 and 8 satellites.&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt;

ENA data from the NASA/ESA ISEE 1 satellite enabled the construction of the first global image of the storm time ring current in 1982.  This was a breakthrough that paved the way for the use of ENAs as a powerful imaging technique.  ENAs were also detected during the 1982 magnetic storm by SEEP instrument on the NASA S81-1 spacecraft.  In 1989, the exospheric hydrogen atom population around Earth was extensively studied by the NASA [[Dynamics Explorer|Dynamic Explorer]] (DE-1) satellite.&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt;

[[File:TWINS-FirstLight-v3 800.jpg|thumb|300px| Launched in 2008, NASA TWINS currently uses ENA detectors on twin satellites to produce 3-D images of Earth's Magnetosphere]]
An instrument with a dedicated high-energy ENA detection channel was flown on the 1991 NASA [[CRRES]] satellite.  A more sophisticated high energy particle Instrument was launched on the 1992 NASA/ISAS [[GEOTAIL]] spacecraft dedicated to observing Earth's magnetosphere. Precipitating ENAs can be studied from a low Earth orbit and were measured "looking out" by CRRES and the 1995 Swedish [[Astrid (satellites)|ASTRID]] satellites.&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt;

The new millennium saw ENA Imaging coming into its own.  Extensive and detailed observations of the Earth's magnetosphere were made with three ENA instruments aboard the NASA [[IMAGE]] Mission from 2000 - 2005.&lt;ref name=IMAGE1/&gt;  In July 2000, a set of ENA images of the Earth's ring current were made during a geomagnetic storm. (See image at the top of the page.)  The storm was triggered by a fast coronal mass ejection that erupted from the Sun on July 14, 2000 and arrived at Earth the next day.

Launched in 2008, the [[NASA TWINS Mission]] (two wide-angle Imaging Neutral-atom Spectrometers) provides the capability for stereoscopically imaging the magnetosphere. By imaging ENAs over a broad energy range (~1-100 keV) using identical instruments on two widely spaced high-altitude, high-inclination spacecraft, TWINS enables 3-dimensional visualization and the resolution of large scale structures and dynamics within the magnetosphere.&lt;ref name="TWINS1" /&gt;

===Planetary and other magnetospheres===
Magnetospheres of other planets have been studied by flyby spacecraft, by orbiters, landers and by Earth-based observations.&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt;

====Earth's Moon====
In February 2009, the ESA SARA LENA instrument aboard India's [[Chandrayaan-1]] detected hydrogen ENAs [[sputtering|sputtered]] from the lunar surface by solar wind protons.  Predictions had been that all impacting protons would be absorbed by the [[lunar soil|lunar regolith]] but for an as yet unknown reason, 20% of them are bounced back as low energy hydrogen ENAs.  It is hypothesized that the absorbed protons may produce water and [[hydroxyl]]s in interactions with the regolith.&lt;ref name=Chandra1&gt;{{Cite journal

The dynamics of Saturn's magnetosphere are very different from Earth's.  Plasma co-rotates with Saturn in its magnetosphere.  Saturn's strong magnetic field and rapid rotation create a strong co-rotational electric field that accelerates plasma in its magnetosphere until it reaches rotation speeds near that of the planet.  Because Saturn's moons are essentially 'sitting still' in this very high speed flow, a complex interaction between this plasma and the atmosphere of the moon Titan was observed.&lt;ref name=BrandtMitchell/&gt;

==Heliospheric ENA imaging==
The [[heliosphere]] is a cavity built up by the [[solar wind]] as it presses outward against the pressure of the local [[interstellar medium]] (LISM). As the solar wind is a plasma, it is charged and so carries with it the Sun's magnetic field.  So the heliosphere can be conceptualized as the Solar System's magnetosphere.  The edge of the heliosphere is found far beyond the [[orbit]] of [[Pluto]] where diminishing solar wind pressure is stopped by the pressure from the LISM.&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt;
[[File:IBEXmagneticfieldinfluence.jpg|thumb|300px| A possible explanation for the bright ribbon of ENA emission as seen in the IBEX map is that a galactic magnetic field shapes the heliosphere as it drapes over it.  The ribbon appears to be produced by the alignment of magnetic fields at our [[heliosphere]].]]

The background neutral gas for ENA production at the heliospheric boundary comes predominantly from interstellar gas penetrating the heliosphere.  A tiny amount comes from solar wind neutralization of interplanetary dust near the sun. The heliospheric boundaries are invisible and fluctuating.  Although the densities are low, the enormous thickness of the [[heliosphere|heliosheath]] make it a dominant source of ENAs, aside from planetary magnetospheres.&lt;ref name=BrandtMitchell/&gt;  Because of the strong dependence of ENA characteristics on heliospheric properties, remote ENA imaging techniques will provide a global view of the structure and dynamics of the heliosphere unattainable by any other means.&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt;

The first glimpse of this view was announced in October, 2009, when the NASA [[Interstellar Boundary Explorer|IBEX Mission]], returned its first image of the unexpected ENA ribbon at the edge of the [[heliosphere]].&lt;ref name = IBEX1&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2009-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Results revealed a previously unpredicted "very narrow ribbon that is two to three times brighter than anything else in the sky" at the edge of the heliosphere that was not detected by [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2]] in the region. These results are truly exciting as they do not match any existing theoretical models of this region.&lt;ref name = IBEX1/&gt;

[[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] also ENA-imaged the heliosphere and its results complement and extend the IBEX findings, making it possible for scientists to construct the first comprehensive sky map of the heliosphere.  Preliminary [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] data suggest the heliosphere may not have the comet-like shape predicted by existing models but that its shape may be more like a large, round bubble.&lt;ref name=CassiniMunsell/&gt;

Estimates for size of the heliosphere vary between 150&amp;nbsp;– 200 [[Astronomical unit|AU]].{{Ref label|A|a|none}}&lt;ref name=BrandtMitchell/&gt;  It is believed that [[Voyager 1]] passed the heliosphere's [[termination shock]] in 2002 at approx. 85&amp;nbsp;– 87 AU&lt;ref name=RHPMH/&gt; while [[Voyager 2]] passed the termination shock in 2007 at about 85 AU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The huge distances involved mean we will never accumulate a large number of ''in situ'' measurements of the various layers of the heliosphere.  Voyager 1 and 2 took 27 yrs. and 30 yrs. respectively to arrive at the termination shock.  It is worth noting that for large distances to the object, high energy (velocity) and slower ENAs emitted simultaneously would be detected at different times. This time difference varies from 1&amp;nbsp;- 15 minutes for observing Earth's magnetosphere from a high altitude spacecraft to more than a year for imaging the heliospheric boundary from an Earth orbit.&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt;

==Flares/CMEs==

In a surprising development, a wholly different kind of ENA source appeared in 2006.
The [[STEREO]] spacecraft detected neutral hydrogen atoms with energies in the 2-5 MeV range from the flare/CME SOL2006-12-05.&lt;ref name=Mewaldt&gt;{{Cite journal

These particles were not detected with an instrument designed to see ENAs, but there was sufficient ancillary data to make the observation quite unambiguous. 
Accelerating ENAs without ionizing them would be difficult, so the reasonable interpretation here is that [[Solar Energetic Particle|SEP]] protons from the flare/CME were able to find singly-charged He and He-like atoms in the solar wind, and thence to convert and continue without magnetic effects.
The particles thus arrived prior to the SEP protons themselves, constrained to follow the [[Parker spiral]].
Although no other event has been detected this way, probably many could, and in principle could provide substantial information about the processes involved in SEP acceleration and propagation.

==ENA instruments==
&lt;!--{{Main|Detection of ENAs}}--&gt;
Although the study of ENAs promised improvements in the understanding of global magnetospheric and heliospheric processes, its progress was hindered due to initially enormous experimental difficulties.

In the late 1960s, the first direct ENA measurement attempts revealed the difficulties involved.  ENA fluxes are very weak, sometimes less than 1 particle per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per second and are typically detected by secondary electron emission upon contact with a solid surface.  They exist in regions containing ultraviolet (UV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation at fluxes 100 times greater than produce similar emissions.&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt;

An ENA instrument ideally would also specifically:
# prevent the entrance of charged particles
# suppress background light (photons), particularly UV and EUV radiation
# measure mass and energy of incoming ENAs
# determine trajectories of incoming ENAs
# measure ENA fluxes from 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per steradian per second
# measure ENAs ranging in energy from a few eV up to &gt;100 keV&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt;
The challenge to remote sensing via ENAs lies in combining mass spectrometry with the imaging of weak particle fluxes within the stringent limitations imposed by an application on a spacecraft.&lt;ref name=OHBP/&gt;

===Medium and high energy ENA cameras===
It became clear very early that to succeed, instruments would have to specialize in specific ENA energies. The following describes, in very simplified terms, a typical instrument function for high (HENA) or medium (MENA) energy instrument, with differences noted.  The accompanying illustration is of the HENA camera flown on the NASA IMAGE mission and the description that follows most closely resembles IMAGE mission instruments.

====Collimator====
A set of electrostatic plates deflect charged particles away from the instrument and collimates the beam of incoming neutral atoms to a few degrees.
&lt;!--
====Focus====
Narrow, slit apertures, a variation on the pinhole camera, allow one-directional focus.  While very small apertures produce the best focus and direction determination, they require a high flux for success and so are unsuitable for the low flux ENA observation requirement.  Weak signals cannot be collected and concentrated by diffracting and/or refracting elements as can be done in optical astronomy.

The solution is image multiplexing, which entails the use of a coded aperture that allows a set of small apertures to collect and detect ENAs simultaneously.  Although the first stage 'image' is non recognizable, the proper selection aperture pattern enables each signal to be separated out in post processing to produce an image while eliminating errors and artifacts.  Image multiplexing has now been successfully used in space and laboratory experiments for over 40 years.&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt;
--&gt;

====Photon rejection &amp; time of flight (TOF)====
'''HENA''':  TOF is determined by a coincidence detection requirement that turns out to be efficient at eliminating photon background noise as well.  An ENA passes through a thin film to a particle energy detector with its energy nearly completely preserved.  At the same time, electrons forward scattered from the film are [[Electrostatics|electrostatically]] deflected to a detector to create a start pulse.  The ENA arriving at its solid state detector (SSD) creates the end pulse and its impact position yields its trajectory and therefore path length.  The start and stop signals enable TOF to be determined.

If the electrons are scattered by incoming photons, no ENA will be detected to create the stop pulse.  If no stop pulse is sensed within an established time appropriate to the energy of the expected particles,  the start pulse is discarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title= IMATE High-Energy Neutral Atom (HENA) Imager
| website=Southwest Research Institute
| url=http://pluto.space.swri.edu/image/HENA_description.html
| accessdate=2009-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MENA''': Medium energy ENAs would lose too much energy penetrating the film used in the HENA instrument.  The thinner film required would be vulnerable to damage by incident UV and EUV.  Therefore, photons are prevented from entering the instrument by using a gold diffraction grating.  An ultra thin carbon film is mounted on the back of the grating.  ENAs pass through the grating and the film to impact a solid state detector (SSD), scattering electrons and allowing path length and TOF determinations as for the HENA above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title= IMATE Medium-Energy Neutral Atom (HENA) Imager
| website=Southwest Research Institute
| url=http://pluto.space.swri.edu/image/MENA_description2.html
| accessdate=2009-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowing path length and TOF enables velocity to be determined.

====Energy====
The solid state detector (SSD) impacted by the ENA after it passes through the foil registers its energy.  The small energy loss due to passing through the foil is handled by instrument calibration.

====Mass====
Knowing the energy and velocity, the mass of the particle can be calculated from energy = mv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2.  Alternatively, the number of scattered electrons detected can also serve to measure the mass of the ENA.&lt;ref name=BrandtMitchell/&gt;

Mass resolution requirements are normally modest, requiring at most distinguishing among hydrogen (1 amu), helium (4 amu), and oxygen (16 amu) atoms with sulfur (32 amu) also expected in Jupiter's magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=BrandtMitchell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt;

====2D and 3D imaging====
Usually, obtaining images from a spinning spacecraft provides the second dimension of direction identification.  By combining synchronized observations from two different satellites, stereo imaging becomes possible.&lt;ref name=Gruntman97/&gt;  Results from the TWINS Mission are eagerly awaited, as two viewing points will provide substantially more information about the 3-D nature of Earth's magnetosphere.

===Low energy ENA cameras===
While the collimator is similar, low-energy instruments such as the NASA GSFC LENA use a foil-stripping technique.  Incident ENAs interact with a surface such as tungsten to generate ions that are then analyzed by an ion spectrometer.&lt;ref name=BrandtMitchell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Because of the need to detect atoms [[sputtering|sputtered]] from the lunar surface as well lighter ENAs, the ESA LENA on the [[Chandrayaan-1]] incorporated a mass spectrometer designed to resolve heavier masses including [[sodium]], [[potassium]], and [[iron]].&lt;ref name=Chandra1/&gt;

===Future===
As of 2005, a total of only six dedicated ENA detectors had been flown.&lt;ref name=BrandtMitchell/&gt;  The launch of instruments aboard in the TWINS and IBEX missions brings the total to nine in 2009 - a 50% increase in only 4 years. Space plasma observation using ENA imaging is an emerging technology that is finally coming into its own.

Several improvements are still needed to perfect the technique.  Although the angular resolution has now decreased to a few degrees and different species can be separated, one challenge is to expand the energy range upwards to about 500 keV.  This high energy range covers most of the plasma pressure of Earth's inner magnetosphere as well as some of the higher-energy radiation belts so is desirable for terrestrial ENA imaging.&lt;ref name=BrandtMitchell/&gt;

For lower energy ENAs, below 1 keV, the imaging techniques are completely different and rely on the spectroscopic analysis of ions stripped from a surface by the impinging ENA.  Improvements in sub-keV measurements will be needed to image Mercury's magnetosphere due to the consequences of its smaller magnetic field and it smaller geometry.&lt;ref name=BrandtMitchell/&gt;

==Importance for Earth==
In addition to the obvious intellectual benefits brought by increased understanding of our space environment, there are many practical motivations for enhancing our knowledge of space plasmas.

The heliosphere is a protective cocoon for the Solar System, just as the Earth's magnetosphere is a protective cocoon for the Earth. The insight provided by ENAs into the behaviour of space plasmas improves our understanding of these protective mechanisms.

Without the magnetosphere, Earth would be subject to direct bombardment by the solar wind and may be unable to retain an atmosphere. This, plus increased exposure to solar radiation means that life on Earth as we know it would not be possible without the magnetosphere.  Similarly, the heliosphere protects the Solar System from the majority of otherwise damaging cosmic rays, with the remainder being deflected by the Earth's magnetosphere.

Although most orbiting satellites are protected by the magnetosphere, geomagnetic storms induce currents in conductors that disrupt communications both in space and in cables on the ground.  Better understanding of the magnetosphere and the ring current and its interaction with the solar wind during high solar activity will allow us to better protect these assets.

Astronauts on deep space missions will not have Earth's protections so understanding the factors that may affect their exposure to cosmic rays and the solar wind is critical to manned space exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Notes==
{{note label|A|a|none}}Astronomers measure distances within the Solar System in [[astronomical unit]]s (AU). One AU equals the average distance between the centers of Earth and the Sun, or 149,598,000&amp;nbsp;km. Pluto is about 38 AU from the Sun and Jupiter is about 5.2 AU from the Sun. One [[light-year]] is 63,240 AU.

== Employees and FWPs ==
Financial wellness concerns the management of the financial health of an individual, supporting a balance between their short-term and long-term financial needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nextavenue.org/workplace-financial-wellness-programs/?utm_source=sumome&amp;utm_medium=linkedin&amp;utm_campaign=sumome_share|title=Why Workplace Financial Wellness Program aren’t well|last=Eisenberg|first=Richard|date=1 August 2018|publisher=[[Next Avenue]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=The 2018 Bank of America Merrill Lynch Workplace Benefits Report surveyed 657 employees who participate in 401(k) plans and 667 employers who offer a 401(k) and a financial wellness program.

But employees prioritize long-term financial goals, such as ways to help them save and invest for the future.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial wellness programs work through employers supporting their employees’ goals with a program that provides them with the "ability to track their progress and accomplishments, factoring in their goals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nextavenue.org/workplace-financial-wellness-programs/?utm_source=sumome&amp;utm_medium=linkedin&amp;utm_campaign=sumome_share|title=Why Workplace Financial Wellness Program aren’t well|last=Eisenberg|first=Richard|date=1 August 2018|publisher=[[Next Avenue]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=When both groups were asked what would help improve employee financial wellness the most, employees wanted practical guidance that would “focus on the single next thing to do — one step at a time.” By contrast, employers said: “considering the impact of employer benefits on overall personal finances.” Employees also said they want personalized advice from a professional, with the ability to track their progress and accomplishments, factoring in their goals.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of employees, financial wellness programs are successful if they have "minimal financial stress; a strong financial foundation (little or no debt, an emergency savings fund and are living below their means); and a plan they are following that puts them on track to meet future financial goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/powell/2014/09/27/powell-financial-wellness-program-benefit/15457903|title=More companies offer financial wellness programs|last=Powell|first=Robert|date=27 September 2014|publisher=[[USA Today]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=: Financial wellness, from an employees' perspective, is a state of financial well-being, where they have: minimal financial stress; a strong financial foundation (little or no debt, an emergency savings fund and are living below their means); and a plan they are following that puts them on track to meet future financial goals.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 report by [[Michal Grinstein-Weiss|Grinstein-Weiss]] and Lass suggested that “successful financial wellness programs could offer opportunities for employees to improve their financial management, decision-making, and credit scores; increase job stability, work satisfaction, and short- and long-term investments; and decrease debt and financial stress.”&lt;ref name="Hannon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://csd.wustl.edu/publications/documents/wp17-23.pdf|title=Employee Financial Wellness Programs: A Review of the Literature and Directions for Future Research|year=2017|publisher=[[George Warren Brown School of Social Work]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|author=Geraldine Hannon, Meredith Covington, Mat Despard, Ellen Frank-Miller, Michal Grinstein-Weiss|quote= Grinstein-Weiss and Lass (2013) reported that successful financial wellness programs could offer opportunities for employees to improve their financial management, decision making, and credit scores; increase job stability, work satisfaction, and short- and long-term investments; and decrease debt and financial stress.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Employers and FWPs ==
According to Grinstein-Weiss et al., a number of recent studies have “linked employee financial wellness to improved employer outcomes.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://csd.wustl.edu/publications/documents/wp17-23.pdf|title=Employee Financial Wellness Programs: A Review of the Literature and Directions for Future Research|year=2017|publisher=[[George Warren Brown School of Social Work]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|author=Geraldine Hannon, Meredith Covington, Mat Despard, Ellen Frank-Miller, Michal Grinstein-Weiss|quote= A number of recent studies linked employee financial wellness to improved employer outcomes. Financial wellness has been linked to improved productivity (Center for Credit Union Innovation, 2002; Stanford Center on Longevity, 2014), reduced distractions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The returns are potentially large. According to a report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau the return on investment for employers from comprehensive health wellness programs appears to be between $1 and $3 for each dollar invested and early evidence suggests that FWPs can be similarly effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/financial-wellness-at-work/|title=Financial wellness at work: A review of promising practices and policies|last=Cordray|first=Richard|year=2014|publisher=[[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=The return on investment to employers from comprehensive health wellness programs, though hard to pinpoint, appears to be large, ranging from $1 to $3 or more per dollar invested.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial wellness programs prioritize the recognition of the relationship with money and their financial literacy by employers, which is recognised in the [[Financial Literacy Month|National Financial Literacy Month]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/100615/why-financial-literacy-and-education-so-important.asp|title=Why financial literacy is so important|last=Zucchi|first=Kristina|date=26 January 2018|publisher=[[Investopedia]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good financial wellness program can lead to less physical illness due to lower stress rates, a higher level of focus and in turn, an improved level of productivity.&lt;ref name="2014Powell"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/powell/2014/09/27/powell-financial-wellness-program-benefit/15457903|title=More companies offer financial wellness programs|last=Powell|first=Robert|date=27 September 2014|publisher=[[USA Today]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=From an employee perspective, it can lead to higher satisfaction and better knowledge of their employer benefits, less physical illness due to lower stress, higher productivity at work and, of course, financial security. ... What's more, financial wellness programs can reduce absenteeism, as well as disability and workers' compensation costs. That's because poor financial management causes stress, which sets the stage for medical problems, the CFPB said in its report.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Powell writes that FWPs can reduce the number of employee absences, as well as disability and worker’s compensation costs and provide lower employee turnover and lower healthcare, therefore, directly benefiting employers’ return on investment.&lt;ref name="2014Powell"/&gt;

A report from the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] commented on the relationship between productivity, spending and financial wellness:&lt;ref name="CFPB2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/financial-wellness-at-work/|title=Financial wellness at work: A review of promising practices and policies|last=Cordray|first=Richard|year=2014|publisher=[[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=Given the large costs that may be associated with financial stress in terms of productivity loss and higher health care spending, employers have a potentially large incentive to explore cost effective ways to enhance employee financial wellness.  Indeed, employees would also clearly benefit from any programs that reduced stress that may be linked to poor health.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, most workplaces do not offer financial wellness programs as an employee benefit, although a survey of 400 companies revealed that many bussinesses plan to focus on financial wellness in the future.&lt;ref name="2014RobertPowell"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/powell/2014/09/27/powell-financial-wellness-program-benefit/15457903|title=More companies offer financial wellness programs|last=Powell|first=Robert|date=27 September 2014|publisher=[[USA Today]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=To be sure, most employers don't offer financial wellness programs. But three-quarters of about 400 large companies surveyed by Aon Hewitt survey say they're planning to focus more on financial wellness this year.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efficacy ==
Recently a report by [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]] 2018 survey found that although 48% of the employees they surveyed were offered workplace financial welfare plans only 31% participate in them because the services offered were not of interest to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nextavenue.org/workplace-financial-wellness-programs/?utm_source=sumome&amp;utm_medium=linkedin&amp;utm_campaign=sumome_share|title=Why Workplace Financial Wellness Program aren’t well|last=Eisenberg|first=Richard|date=1 August 2018|publisher=[[Next Avenue]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=Little wonder, then, that Bank of America Merrill Lynch also found that although 48 percent of the employees surveyed were offered workplace financial wellness plans, only 31 percent participate in them. One reason employees said they demur: “Don’t offer services of interest to me.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|PwC]] survey found that employees certainly wanted help with their financial decisions but for the majority, in practice, this means access to unbiased counselors providing help to understand and how to use the benefit they were being offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/private-company-services/library/financial-well-being-retirement-survey.html|title=2018 Employee Financial Wellness Survey: PwC|year=2018|publisher=[[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=More than half of all employees want to make their own financial decisions but are looking to have someone validate that decision. Employees want a financial wellness benefit with access to unbiased counselors and help understanding and using their benefits.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans (2018) survey of employers found that one-to-one meetings were considered the most effective approach with the highest levels of participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nextavenue.org/workplace-financial-wellness-programs/?utm_source=sumome&amp;utm_medium=linkedin&amp;utm_campaign=sumome_share|title=Why Workplace Financial Wellness Program aren’t well|last=Eisenberg|first=Richard|date=1 August 2018|publisher=[[Next Avenue]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=Employees also said they want personalized advice from a professional, with the ability to track their progress and accomplishments, factoring in their goals. Similarly, in the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans (IFEBP) 2018 survey of employers, in-person, one-on-one meetings were rated as the most effective meeting approach, with the highest participation rates.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Finno-Ugrian suicide hypothesis''' proposes to link genetic ties originating among [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric]] [[culture]]s and [[Ethnic group|ethnicities]] to high rate of [[suicide]], claiming an [[allele]] common among them is responsible.

[[Mari people|Mari]] and [[Udmurt people|Udmurts]] have been found to have a three times higher suicide rate than Finns and Hungarians. It has been thus theorized that such a possible allele may have arisen in those populations.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

However, contrary to the hypothesis, available contemporary (1990–1994) suicide rates were uniformly negatively associated with these ancestry proportions. The findings of this first test outside Europe are therefore conflicting. A proposal based on the geographical study approach is offered to further the progress of investigations into the genetics of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://pms.sagepub.com/content/103/2/543.full.pdf|title=Ancestry, genes, and suicide: a test of the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis in the United States|journal=Percept Mot Skills|year=2006|volume=103|issue=2|pages=543–50|pmid=17165419|author=Voracek M|doi=10.2466/pms.103.2.543-550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guédelon Castle''' ('''''Château de Guédelon''''') is a castle currently under construction near [[Treigny]], [[France]]. The castle is the focus of an [[experimental archaeology]] project aimed at recreating a 13th-century castle and its environment using period technique, dress, and material.

In order to fully investigate the technology required in the past, the project is using only period construction techniques, tools, and costumes. Materials, including wood and stone, are all obtained locally. Jacques Moulin, chief architect for the project, designed the castle according to the architectural model developed during the 12th and 13th centuries by [[Philip II of France]].

Construction started in 1997 under Michel Guyot, owner of [[Château de Saint-Fargeau]], a [[castle]] in [[Saint-Fargeau]] 13 kilometres away. The site was chosen according to the availability of construction materials: an abandoned [[quarry|stone quarry]], in a large forest, with a nearby [[pond]]. The site is in a rural woodland area and the nearest town is [[Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye]], about {{convert|5|km|mi}} to the northeast.

==History==
In 1979, French entrepreneur [[Michel Guyot]] purchased the ruins of the [[Château de Saint-Fargeau]] and began restoring it with profits raised on-site..&lt;ref name=henley&gt;{{cite news|last=Henley|first=Jon|title=King of a modern medieval castle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jul/31/jonhenley|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=30 July 1999|accessdate=25 October 2018|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F1999%2Fjul%2F31%2Fjonhenley|archive-date=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1995, a study by Guyot's staff revealed the medieval foundations beneath the modern, brick structure, complete with a hypothesized plan of the original castle. Guyot built the existing château after some consideration, but began assembling funds and experts and opening negotiations with the French government to build a new castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The story begins|url=https://www.guedelon.fr/en/the-story-begins_76.html|publisher=Guédelon Castle|accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over five months in 1997, Guyot raised €400,000 from the [[European Union]], local and the central French governments, and commercial entities.&lt;ref name=henley/&gt; A former [[sandstone]] quarry, located in a woodland two hours south of [[Paris]], was chosen as the site of Guédelon Castle because of its relative elevation and abundance in natural resources, whose transport would be expensive in the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Minard|Folcher|2003|p=57}} Permission for construction was given by the commune of [[Treigny]] on 25 July 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guédelon's building plans|url=https://www.guedelon.fr/en/guedelon-s-building-plans_82.html|publisher=Guédelon|accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ground was broken the following year with the clearing of the site and the erection of the first workshops.&lt;ref name=ORDER&gt;{{cite web|title=Order of construction|url=https://www.guedelon.fr/en/order-of-construction_86.html|publisher=Guédelon Castle|accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first stone was laid on 20 June 1997.{{sfn|Durand|2005|p=6}} Over the rest of that year and into 1998, the perimeter was built to a meter (3 feet) in height, following which Guédelon was opened to the public.&lt;ref name=ORDER/&gt;

By June 2010, the [[Keep|great tower]] stood at {{convert|15|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schofield|first=Huge|title=France's new medieval castle|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/10440300|work=[[BBC News]]|date=30 June 2010|accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014 the castle was featured in the [[BBC Two]] series ''[[Secrets of the Castle]]'', in which the project was described as "the world's biggest archaeological experiment". The series features [[Ruth Goodman (historian)|Ruth Goodman]], [[Peter Ginn]] and Tom Pinfold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wollaston|first=Sam|title=Secrets Of The Castle review – good, old-fashioned medieval fun|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/nov/19/secrets-of-the-castle-review-good-old-fashioned-medieval-fun|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 November 2014|accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014, the castle was attracting about 300,000 visitors annually,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grant|first=Olly|title=A trip back in time at Guédelon Castle|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/france/11236750/Guedelon-visitor-guide-Secrets-of-the-Castle.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=18 November 2014|accessdate=25 October 2018|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Ftravel%2Fdestinations%2Feurope%2Ffrance%2F11236750%2FGuedelon-visitor-guide-Secrets-of-the-Castle.html|archive-date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had turned over three million euros in profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Godeau|first=Élise|title=Guédelon, créneau pédago|url=http://www.liberation.fr/voyages/2014/09/23/guedelon-creneau-pedago_1106899|work=[[Libération]]|language=fr|date=23 September 2013|accessdate=25 October 2018|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.liberation.fr%2Fvoyages%2F2014%2F09%2F23%2Fguedelon-creneau-pedago_1106899|archive-date=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2200">The '''Information Systems Professional''' (I.S.P), or Informaticien professionnel agréé (I.P.A. in French), is a professional designation issued by the [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] (CIPS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cips.ca CIPS website]&lt;/ref&gt;  Introduced in 1989, the professional designation is recognised by legislation in most provinces of [[Canada]].  Before meeting the entry requirements for professional status an applicant may use the "Candidate Member I.S.P" designation.

CIPS has developed the Computer Science Accreditation Council (CSAC), and the Information Systems and Technology Accreditation Council (ISTAC) to accredit [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] programs in [[Computer Science]], [[Software Engineering]], [[Management Information Systems]], Computer Systems Technology, Applied Information Technology, and post-diploma type programs in Canada.  These accredited programs combined with several years of experience lead to the I.S.P. designation.

==Early life and education==
Jamshed Bharucha was born in [[Mumbai|Mumbai, India]]. His father Jal Bharucha,&lt;ref name = Jal/&gt; a [[Parsi]] engineer from Mumbai, and mother Elizabeth Bharucha&lt;ref name = Elizabeth/&gt; (born Elizabeth Emily Robinson) a musician from Albany, New York, met at the [[University of Michigan]]. Jal Bharucha was the first engineer in India to employ computers in structural design, using an early facility at the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] in the 1960s. Elizabeth Bharucha was organist and choral director at the Scots Kirk (Church of Saints Andrew &amp; Columba) and the All Saints Church&lt;ref name="All Saints"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdtapvtltd.org/allsaints.htm |title=All Saints Church, Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Mumbai. Jal and Elizabeth were founding members of the Bombay International School,&lt;ref name="BIS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bisschool.com/ |title=Bombay International School}}&lt;/ref&gt; from which Jamshed graduated.

Bharucha graduated from [[Vassar College]] where he majored in [[biological psychology|biopsychology]] (1978), then received an M.A. in philosophy from [[Yale University]] (1979) and a Ph.D. in [[cognitive psychology]] from [[Harvard University]] (1983). He spent the 1982-83 academic year at [[Cornell University]]. At Harvard he worked with [[Stephen Kosslyn]], [[William Kaye Estes|William K. Estes]] and [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]].

Bharucha studied violin in Mumbai, received an Associate’s Diploma in violin performance from [[Trinity College of Music]] (London) in 1973 and then studied violin at [[Vassar College|Vassar]]. He was a member of the Bombay Chamber Orchestra;&lt;ref name="BCO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcoindia.co.in/ |title=Bombay Chamber Orchestra}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Vassar College Orchestra under the direction of [[Luis Garcia-Renart]]; the [[Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra]] performing at [[Sanders Theatre]] under the direction of [[James Yannatos]]; and the [[Bach Society Orchestra of Harvard University]].

==Academic and administrative career==

===Dartmouth College===
Bharucha spent most of his academic career at [[Dartmouth College]], where he was the John Wentworth Professor and rose from Associate Dean for the Social Sciences to Deputy Provost to Dean of the Faculty of Arts &amp; Sciences.&lt;ref name="DoF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean goals" /&gt; He was the first [[Indian American]] to be named dean of a school at an [[Ivy League]] institution. While in the Dartmouth administration, he established the Dartmouth Brain Imaging Center&lt;ref name="MRI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dbic.dartmouth.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page |title=Dartmouth Brain Imaging Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the first teaching and research MRI facility outside a medical school, accessible to undergraduates, graduate students and faculty. His principal faculty appointment was in the Department of Psychological &amp; Brain Sciences, but he also taught in the Program in Linguistics &amp; Cognitive Science and the Program in [[electroacoustic music|Electroacoustic Music]] (now called Digital Musics).

As an academic administrator, he launched initiatives on teaching and research, as well as their integration in the form of active learning, encouraging undergraduates to get involved in research with their professors.&lt;ref name="UG research"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thedartmouth.com/2002/02/01/opinion/creating/print |title=Dean's initiatives in undergraduate opportunities for active learning at Dartmouth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UG research press"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thedartmouth.com/2002/02/01/news/offers |title=Active learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending 2015-2016 at [[Harvard]], Bharucha was appointed Distinguished Fellow at Dartmouth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Asch|first1=Joseph|title=Jamshed Bharucha is back|url=http://www.dartblog.com/data/2016/08/012778.php|website=Dartmouth's Daily Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he teaches in two departments: Education and Psychological &amp; Brain Science.&lt;ref name="BharuchaDartmouth" /&gt;

===Tufts University===
Bharucha moved from Dartmouth to [[Tufts]] in 2002 to assume the position of Provost &amp; Senior Vice President. He was recruited to Tufts by President [[Lawrence S. Bacow]], who later was appointed President of [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/02/12/tufts-bacow-was-tasked-with-reenergizing-university/gnuNvLxOJs95CHVOLEIZ2O/story.html|title=At Tufts, Lawrence Bacow was tasked with reenergizing the university|last=Fernandes|first=Deirdre|date=February 13, 2018|work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Provost, Bharucha was the chief academic officer of the university, overseeing the seven schools, the [[Tisch College]], the Institute for Global Leadership, the Fares Center and the Clinical &amp; Translational Research Institute.

Bharucha recruited to Tufts [[Vali Nasr]], [[Nalini Ambady]], [[Ray Jackendoff]], Gina Kuperberg, Mathias Scheutz and Peniel Joseph. During his tenure, the volume of sponsored research doubled, the average number of patents per year from research doubled, and revenues from technology transfer and industrial collaboration increased tenfold.&lt;ref name="NYT2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/07/nyregion/07cooper.html|title=At Tufts, Lawrence Bacow was tasked with reenergizing the university|last=Fernandes|first=Deirdre|date=February 13, 2018|work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bharucha launched the Summer Scholars program,&lt;ref name="Summer Scholars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uss.tufts.edu/undergradEducation/research/summer_scholars/index.asp |title=Summer Scholars Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides opportunities for undergraduate students to work on collaborative research with faculty across the university and its affiliated hospitals. He also launched the University Seminar,&lt;ref name="University Seminar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://provost.tufts.edu/1172048132183/Provost-Page-prov2w_1174562916192.html |title=University Seminar at Tufts |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117144251/http://provost.tufts.edu/1172048132183/Provost-Page-prov2w_1174562916192.html |archivedate=2011-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a cross-disciplinary course, open to undergraduate, graduate and professional students.

Additions to the campus during his tenure include the Granoff Music Center&lt;ref name="Granoff"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://as.tufts.edu/music/musiccenter/default.aspx |title=Granoff Music Center at Tufts}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rebuilt Neuroscience Department&lt;ref name="Neuro Dept"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neurosci.tufts.edu/index.html |title=Neuroscience Department, Tufts Medical School}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Tufts School of Medicine.

===Cooper Union===
Bharucha was appointed as the twelfth president of [[Cooper Union|The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art]] effective July 1, 2011.&lt;ref name="Cooper Union"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://provost.tufts.edu/1174149599326/Provost-Page-prov2w_1296830224349.html |title=Provost Bharucha named President-elect of The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213093815/http://provost.tufts.edu/1174149599326/Provost-Page-prov2w_1296830224349.html |archivedate=2011-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His tenure at Cooper Union was marked by controversy connected with [[Cooper Union financial crisis and tuition protests|a financial crisis and tuition protests]].&lt;ref name="cscufcscu" /&gt;

On June 10, 2015, five trustees, supporters of tuition and Bharucha and opponents of the settlement, resigned. The following day, Bharucha announced that he would be stepping down at the end of the month to become a visiting scholar at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/five-cooper-union-trustees-resign-as-attorney-general-probe-continues-1433958506|title=Cooper Union President Resigns|last=Vilensky|first=Mike|date=June 10, 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/06/11/president-and-five-trustees-quit-amid-bitter-unrest-cooper-union|title=Cooper Union Upheaval|last=Woodhouse|first=Kellie|date=June 11, 2015|work=Inside Higher Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cscufcscu"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cscufcscu.com/|title=Committee to Save Cooper Union from the Committee to Save Cooper Union|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611134010/http://cscufcscu.com/|archivedate=2015-06-11|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/amid-tensions-over-tuition-5-cooper-union-trustees-resign-in-protest/100497|title=After Trustees Resign, Cooper Union President Says He Will Step Down|last=Thomason|first=Andy|date=June 10, 2015|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/10/jamshed-bharucha-resigning_n_7558284.html|title=Jamshed Bharucha Resigning as President of Cooper Union|last=McElroy|first=Tom|date=June 10, 2015|work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/nyregion/cooper-union-president-resigns.html|title=New York Times, June 11, 2015|date=June 11, 2015|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karl Konrad Friedrich Wilhelm Lachmann''' ({{IPA-de|ˈlaxman|lang}}; 4 March 1793 – 13 March 1851) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philologist]] and [[critic]]. He is particularly noted for his foundational contributions to the field of [[textual criticism]].

==Biography==

Lachmann was born in [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], in present-day [[Lower Saxony]]. He studied at [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], devoting himself mainly to philological studies. In [[Göttingen]], he founded a critical and philological society in 1811, in conjunction with [[Georg Ludolf Dissen|Dissen]], [[Ernst Schulze (poet)|Schulze]], and [[Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen|Bunsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Lachmann, Karl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite ADB|17|471|481|Lachmann, Karl|Wilhelm Scherer|ADB:Lachmann, Karl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815, he joined the [[Prussian army]] as a volunteer ''[[chasseur]]'' and accompanied his detachment to [[Paris]], but did not see active service. In 1816, he became an assistant master in the Friedrichswerder [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] at Berlin, and a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at the university. The same summer he became one of the principal masters in the Friedrichs-Gymnasium of [[Königsberg]], where he assisted his colleague, the Germanist [[Friedrich Karl Köpke]], with his edition of [[Rudolf von Ems]]' ''[[Barlaam und Josaphat]]'' (1818), and also assisted his friend in a contemplated edition of the works of [[Walther von der Vogelweide]].

In January 1818, he became professor extraordinarius of classical philology in the [[University of Königsberg]], and at the same time began to lecture on [[Old German]] [[grammar]] and the [[Middle High German]] poets. He devoted himself during the following seven years to an extraordinarily detailed study of those subjects, and in 1824, obtained a leave of absence in order to search the libraries of middle and south Germany for further materials.

In 1825, Lachmann was nominated extraordinary professor of classical and German philology at the [[Humboldt University]], Berlin (ordinary professor 1827); in 1830, he was admitted a member of the [[Academy of Sciences]]. He died in [[Berlin]].

==Importance in scholarship==

Lachmann is a figure of considerable importance in the history of German philology.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Rudolf von Raumer]], ''Geschichte der germanischen Philologie'', 1870.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his career, Lachmann translated the first volume of P.E. Müller's ''Sagabibliothek des skandinavischen Altertums'' (1816). In his ''"Habilitationsschrift" über die ursprungliche Gestalt des Gedichts von der Nibelungen Noth'' (1816), and in his review of [[Friedrich Heinrich von der Hagen|Hagen]]'s ''Nibelungen'' and [[Georg Friedrich Benecke|Benecke]]'s ''Bonerius'', contributed in 1817 to the ''Jenaische Literaturzeitung'', he had already laid down the rules of [[textual criticism]] and elucidated the phonetic and metrical principles of Middle High German in a manner which marked a distinct advance in that branch of investigation.

The rigidly scientific character of his method becomes increasingly apparent in the ''Auswahl aus den hochdeutschen Dichtern des dreizehnten Jahrhunderts'' (1820); in the edition of [[Hartmann von Aue|Hartmann]]'s ''Iwein'' (1827); in those of Walther von der Vogelweide (1827) and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] (1833); in the papers "''Über das [[Hildebrandslied]]''," "''Über althochdeutsche Betonung und Verskunst''," "''Über den Eingang des Parzivals''," and "''Über drei Bruchstücke niederrheinischer Gedichte''" published in the ''Abhandlungen'' of the Berlin Academy; and in ''Der Nibelunge Not und die Klage'' (1826), which was followed by a critical commentary in 1836.

Lachmann's ''Betrachtungen über Homer's Iliad'', first published in the ''Abhandlungen'' of the Berlin Academy in 1837 and 1841, in which he sought to show that the ''[[Iliad]]'' consists of eighteen independent "layers" variously enlarged and interpolated, had considerable influence on 19th century [[Homeric scholarship]], although his views are no longer accepted.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

His smaller edition of the [[New Testament]] appeared in 1831, the 3rd edition in 1846, and the larger second edition, in two volumes, between 1842 and 1850. The plan of Lachmann's edition, which he explained in his ''Studia Krit.'' of 1830, is a modification of the unaccomplished project of [[Richard Bentley]]. Lachmann was the first major editor to break from the [[Textus Receptus]], seeking to restore the most ancient reading current in [[manuscript]]s of the [[Alexandrian text-type]], using the agreement of the [[Western text-type|Western]] authorities ([[Old Latin]] and Greek Western [[Uncial]]s) as the main proof of antiquity of a reading where the oldest Alexandrian authorities differ.

Lachmann's edition of [[Lucretius]] (1850), which was the principal occupation of his life from 1845, is perhaps his greatest achievement of scholarship. He demonstrated how the three main manuscripts all derived from one [[archetype]], containing 302 pages of 26 lines to a page. Further, he was able to show that this archetype was a copy of a manuscript written in a [[Carolingian minuscule|minuscule]] hand, which was in turn a copy of a manuscript of the 4th or 5th centuries written in [[rustic capitals]]. To say his recreation of the text was accepted is anticlimactic; [[Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro|HAJ Munro]] characterized this accomplishment as "a work which will be a landmark for scholars as long as the Latin language continues to be studied." Lachmann also edited [[Propertius]] (1816); [[Catullus]] (1829); [[Tibullus]] (1829); [[Joseph Genesius|Genesius]] (1834); [[Terentianus Maurus]] (1836); [[Babrius]] (1845); [[Avianus]] (1845); [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]] (1841–1842); the ''Agrimensores Romani'' (1848–1852); and [[Lucilius]] (edited after his death by [[Johannes Vahlen|Vahlen]], 1876). He also translated [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s sonnets (1820) and ''[[Macbeth]]'' (1829).

== The French School of Anthropology ==

The center was founded in 1967 at [[Paris West University Nanterre La Défense|Paris X University]] by Eric de Dampierre, and associated with the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|National Scientific Research Council]] ([[CNRS]]) from 1968. In 1989 it became a Mixed Research Unit (UMR). Today it is the UMR 7186.

== Activities ==
The spectrum of research activities covered by the LESC is quite vast, reaching from traditional fieldwork based ethnography to visual anthropology. 
These activities are conducted mainly within the three scientific research departments:
* [[Technology]]
* [[Americas|Americanism]]
* [[Ethnomusicology]]

== Learned societies ==
They are two [[Learned society|learned societies]] housed in the LESC.
* The '''Société d'ethnologie''', created in 1986 by Eric de Dampierre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mae.u-paris10.fr/socethno/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130234331/http://www.mae.u-paris10.fr/socethno/index.htm |archivedate=2011-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anthropology library ==
The Library named after Eric de Dampierre has one of the largest collection of anthropological reviews and files on Africanist, Americanist and Mongol studies in France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mae.u-paris10.fr/siteums/ethnobiblio.php?ID=29=] {{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific publications ==
* the '''Ateliers du LESC''', is the electronic publication of the laboratory, available free and online on [[Revues.org]], the French public open source science portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ateliers.revues.org/|title=Ateliers d'anthropologie - Revue éditée par le Laboratoire d'ethnol...|website=Ateliers.revues.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3182">'''Lipid microdomains''' are formed when [[lipid]]s undergo lateral [[phase (matter)|phase]] separations yielding stable coexisting [[lamellar]] [[Lipid bilayer|domain]]s. These [[phase separation]]s can be induced by changes in [[temperature]], [[pressure]], [[ionic strength]] or by the addition of [[divalent]] [[cation]]s or [[protein]]s. The question of whether such lipid microdomains observed in model lipid systems also exist in [[biomembrane]]s had motivated considerable research efforts. Lipid domains are not readily isolated and examined as unique species, in contrast to the examples of lateral [[heterogeneity]].
One can disrupt the membrane and demonstrate a heterogeneous range of [[wikt:composition|composition]] in the [[population]] of the resulting [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] or [[fragmentation (cell biology)|fragments]]. [[Electron microscopy]] can also be used to demonstrate lateral inhomogeneities in biomembranes.

Often, lateral heterogeneity has been inferred from biophysical techniques where the observed signal indicates multiple populations rather than the expected homogenous population. An example of this is the measurement of the [[diffusion coefficient]] of a [[fluorescent]] lipid analogue in soybean [[protoplast]]s. Membrane microheterogeneity is sometimes inferred from the behavior of [[enzyme]]s, where the enzymatic activity does not appear to be correlated with the [[average]] lipid [[physical state]] exhibited by the bulk of the membrane. Often, the methods suggest regions with different lipid [[Membrane fluidity|fluidity]], as would be expected of coexisting [[gel]] and [[liquid crystal]]line phases within the biomembrane. This is also the conclusion of a series of studies where differential effects of perturbation caused by ''[[Cis-trans isomerism|cis]]'' and ''[[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]]'' [[fatty acid]]s are interpreted in terms of preferential partitioning of the two liquid crystalline and gel-like domains.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14474">Inspired by the terms [[genome]] and [[genomics]], other words to describe complete [[Biology|biological]] datasets, mostly sets of [[biomolecules]] originating from one [[organism]], have been coined with the suffix ''[[-ome]]'' and ''-[[omics]]''. Some of these terms are related to each other in a [[hierarchical]] fashion. For example, the genome contains the [[ORFeome]], which gives rise to the [[transcriptome]], which is translated to the [[proteome]]. Other terms are overlapping and refer to the structure and/or function of a subset of proteins (e.g. [[glycome]], [[kinome]]).

An omicist is a scientist who studies omeomics, cataloging all the “omics” subfields.&lt;ref name="Yadav 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Wholeness in Suffix -omics, -omes, and the Word Om | author=Yadav SP. | journal=J Biomol Tech | year=2007 | volume=18 | issue=5 | pages=277 | pmid= 18166670 | pmc=2392988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medical resident work hours''' refers to the (often lengthy) shifts worked by [[medical intern]]s and residents during their [[medical residency]].

As per ACGME residents are allowed to work a max of 80hours a week. so typically residents will work 40-80  hours a week depends on speciality and rotation within the speciality ,&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527031017/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html |date=May 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with residents occasionally logging 136 (out of 168) hours in a week.&lt;ref name=HRG&gt;[http://www.internetfreespeech.org/print_article.cfm?ID=6666]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310201116/http://www.internetfreespeech.org/print_article.cfm?ID=6666 |date=March 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies show that about 40% of this work is not direct patient care, but ancillary care, such as paperwork.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; Trainee doctors are often not paid on an hourly basis, but on a fixed salary; in some locations, they are paid for booked overtime. Limits on working hours have led to misreporting, where the resident works more hours than they record.&lt;ref name="dishonesty" /&gt;

Medical resident work hours have become a hot topic of discussion due to the potential negative results of sleep deprivation on both residents and their patients. According to a study of 4510 obstetric-gynecologic residents, 71.3% reported sleeping less than 3 hours while on night call.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Defoe, Deidre M., et al. "Long Hours and Little Sleep: Work Schedules of Residents in Obstetrics and Gynecology." ''Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology'', vol. 97, no. 6, June 2001, pp. 1015–18. ''ScienceDirect'', doi:10.1016/S0029-7844(01)01363-1.&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey of 3604 first- and second-year residents, 20% reported sleeping an average of 5 hours or less per night, and 66% averaged 6 hours or less per night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=DeWitt C.|last2=Daugherty|first2=Steven R.|date=2004-03-01|title=Sleep Deprivation and Fatigue in Residency Training: Results of a National Survey of First- and Second-Year Residents|url=https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/27/2/217/2708402|journal=Sleep|volume=27|issue=2|pages=217–223|doi=10.1093/sleep/27.2.217|issn=0161-8105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of high workloads ==
Medical residencies usually require lengthy hours of trainees. Trainees are traditionally required to be present for set shifts, with the ending time of the shift dependent on momentary circumstances. The flexibility of this system makes it easy to abuse.

Junior doctors often lack bargaining power and have difficulty changing employers. This leaves them with little say over their working conditions. Critics of long residency hours note that resident physicians in the US [[National Resident Matching Program#Controversy and lawsuits|have no alternatives to the position that they are matched to]], meaning residents must accept all conditions of employment, including very long work hours, and that they must also, in many cases, contend with poor supervision.&lt;ref name="HRG"/&gt;  This process, they contend, reduces the competitive pressures on hospitals, resulting in low salaries and long, unsafe work hours. The Match program has also been [[Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges|accused of deliberately limiting the available residency posts]], thus reducing the [[demand (economics)|demand]] for residents, despite the work for much larger numbers of residents being available.

In emergencies and in chronically understaffed health systems, all staff, including junior doctors, may be overworked. In some cases, excess work may be disproportionately assigned to junior doctors.

There are financial incentives for overworking junior doctors. Since the least-experienced staff are usually paid less, it is cheaper to assign paid overtime to them. Deliberate understaffing and paid or unpaid overtime for junior doctors is thus used to reduce costs for medical facilities, although this may also reduce quality of care, which can be expensive.

The medical culture has also been blamed. "Generation-bashing", where senior doctors look down on junior doctors who work fewer residency hours than they did, can push junior doctors to overwork.&lt;ref name=schultz/&gt; A desire for formal recognition, such as promotion, may also be important.&lt;ref name=dishonesty/&gt; A higher "entry barrier", with work conditions poor enough to burn out some residents, may be actively desired.

There is also a belief that long hours do, or can, improve training. The ability to follow a patient from admission through the next 30 or 40 hours may be valued more than observing several patients for shorter periods.

The desire to continue caring for a patient frequently leads doctors to work for longer than is permitted.&lt;ref name=dishonesty/&gt;

==Effects on health==

===Effects of sleep deprivation on residents===
The evidence for harm to people who are deprived of sleep, or work irregular hours, is robust.

Research from Europe and the United States on nonstandard work hours and sleep deprivation found that late-hour workers are subject to higher risks of gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, miscarriage, preterm birth, and low birth weight of their newborns.&lt;ref&gt;See Biological Rhythms: Implications for the Worker, publication OTA-BA-463 (U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, 1991); {{cite journal | author = Bøggild Henrik, Knutsson Anders | year = 1999 | title = Shift Work, Risk Factors, and Cardiovascular Disease | url = | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Work and Environmental Health | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 85–99 | doi=10.5271/sjweh.410}}; and Alexander Wedderburn (ed.), "Shiftwork and Health," special issue of the Bulletin of European Studies on Time (BEST), vol. 1 (Luxembourg, Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, 2000), on the Internet at www.eurofound.ie, (visited Feb. 25, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shown that slow-wave sleep assists in clearing out toxins that build up during the day. Consequently, the disruption of slow-wave sleep increases the level of amyloid-beta, a protein aggregate commonly found in Alzheimer's, present in cerebrospinal fluid the following morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ju|first=Yo-El S|last2=Ooms|first2=Sharon J|last3=Sutphen|first3=Courtney|last4=Macauley|first4=Shannon L.|last5=Zangrilli|first5=Margaret A.|last6=Jerome|first6=Gina|last7=Fagan|first7=Anne M.|last8=Mignot|first8=Emmanuel|last9=Zempel|first9=John M.|date=2017-08-01|title=Slow wave sleep disruption increases cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β levels|url=https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/140/8/2104/3933862|journal=Brain|volume=140|issue=8|pages=2104–2111|doi=10.1093/brain/awx148|issn=0006-8950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic sleep deprivation and the resulting fatigue and stress can affect job productivity and the incidence of workplace accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kauppinen |first=Timo |year=2001 |title=The 24-Hour Society and Industrial Relations Strategies |location=Oslo, Norway |publisher=European Industrial Relations Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also social effects. Married fathers in the United States who work fixed night shifts are 6 times more likely than their counterparts who work days to face divorce; for married mothers, fixed nights increase the odds by a factor of 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Presser |first=Harriet B. |year=2003 |title=Working in a 24/7 Economy: Challenges for American Families |location=New York |publisher=Russell Sage Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of resident sleep deprivation on patients===
The public and the medical education establishment recognize that long hours can be counter-productive, since [[sleep deprivation]] increases rates of [[medical error]]s and affect [[Sleep deprivation#On attention and working memory|attention and working memory]]. Chronically sleep-deprived people also tend to strongly underestimate their degree of impairment.&lt;ref name="SleepDepPVT"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Van Dongen HA |title=The cumulative cost of additional wakefulness: dose-response effects on neurobehavioral functions and sleep physiology from chronic sleep restriction and total sleep deprivation |journal=Sleep |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=117–26 |year= 2002 |url=http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/FactSheets/DrowsyDriving.pdf |pmid=12683469|last2=Maislin |first2=G |last3=Mullington |first3=JM |last4=Dinges |first4=DF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study found that after 24 hours of sustained wakefulness, hand-eye coordination decreased to a level equal to the performance observed at a blood alcohol concentration of roughly 0.10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dawson|first=Drew|last2=Reid|first2=Kathryn|date=July 1997|title=Fatigue, alcohol and performance impairment|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/40775|journal=Nature|volume=388|issue=6639|pages=235–235|doi=10.1038/40775|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a meta-analysis of 959 physicians, staying awake for a continuous 24 to 30 hours decreased physicians' overall performance by nearly 1 standard deviation and clinical performance by more than 1.5 standard deviations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Philibert|first=Ingrid|date=2005-11-01|title=Sleep Loss and Performance in Residents and Nonphysicians: A Meta-Analytic Examination|url=https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/28/11/1392/2707966|journal=Sleep|volume=28|issue=11|pages=1392–1402|doi=10.1093/sleep/28.11.1392|issn=0161-8105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schedule details matter. Competence is affected by the number of work hours, number of continuous work hours, regularity of sleep, and frequency and speed of handovers to the next shift. "Night float" seems to have particularly bad effects, due to the circadian misalignment cause by abrupt switches between day and night shifts, but is the most commonly used method of adapting to duty hour restrictions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.4300/JGME-D-14-00612.1| issn = 1949-8357| volume = 7| issue = 3| pages = 349–363| last1 = Bolster| first1 = Lauren| last2 = Rourke| first2 = Liam| title = The Effect of Restricting Residents' Duty Hours on Patient Safety, Resident Well-Being, and Resident Education: An Updated Systematic Review| journal = Journal of Graduate Medical Education| date = 2015| pmid = 26457139| pmc = 4597944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=float&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/0014013031000085671| issn = 0014-0139| volume = 46| issue = 7| pages = 653–663| last1 = CAVALLO| first1 = ANITA| last2 = RIS| first2 = M.

Many studies have found performance impairment in medical residents due to sleep deprivation. The average sleep time was less for the same emergency department residents working night shifts than when working day shifts, and they took longer to intubate a mannequin and made more errors in a triage simulation when working on the night shift than the day shift.&lt;ref&gt;Smith-Coggins R, Rosekind MR, Buccino KR. Relationship of day versus night sleep to physician performance and mood. Ann Emerg Med 1994;24:928-934.&lt;/ref&gt; First year medical residents given an EKG arrhythmia-detection task performed significantly worse while sleep-deprived than when well-rested.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman RC, Bigger JT, Kornfeld DS. The intern and sleep loss. N Eng J Med 1971;285:201-203&lt;/ref&gt; Medical residents were also found to take more time and make more errors on laparoscopic procedures after one night on call.&lt;ref&gt;Taffinder NJ, McManus IC, Gul Y, et al. Effect of sleep deprivation on surgeons' dexterity on laparoscopy simulator. Lancet 1998;352:1191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grantcharov TP, Bardram L, Funch-Jensen P, et al. Laparoscopic performance after one night on call in a surgical department: prospective study. BMJ 2001;323:1222-1223.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 landmark study found reducing sleep deprivation substantially reduced errors in intensive care units. The study redesigned first-year junior doctors' schedules to minimize the effects of sleep deprivation, circadian disruption, and handover problems, assigning four shifts where there had been three and allowing an hour's overlap for handovers at the ends of shifts. Each junior doctor was closely observed under both schedules. Errors were recorded (and corrected); they were then rated for severity by other doctors [[blind experiment|blinded]] to which treatment the errors had occurred under. Doctors and observers inevitably knew that they were part of a study.&lt;ref name=ICU/&gt;

In 2015 two controlled studies of the effect of the ACGME-mandated maximum shift began, involving nearly 190 hospitals and residency training programs. The studies randomly assigned medical residents to shifts longer than specified by the ACGME regulations. A study led by the University of Pennsylvania, which will end in 2019, assigned residents in 32 medical training programs to shifts as long as 30 hours. It used 31 other programs as a control group. Despite the longer shifts, the other overall rules were still adhered to. The other study, led by Northwestern University and ending in 2015, was similar in design. Both were conducted with the approval of the ACGME. In neither study were residents and patients necessarily told they were part of a human subjects experiment and informed consent was not required, which caused some controversy.&lt;ref name="WaPo28Oct2015"&gt;{{cite news |title=Some new doctors are working 30-hour shifts at hospitals around the U.S. |newspaper=Washington Post |date=October 28, 2015 |last=Bernstein |first=Lenny |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/some-new-doctors-are-working-30-hour-shifts-at-hospitals-around-the-us/2015/10/28/ab7e8948-7b83-11e5-beba-927fd8634498_story.html |accessdate=2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trib19Nov2015"&gt;{{cite news |title=Northwestern-led study of medical residents working 28-hour shifts decried |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=November 19, 2015 |last=Russell |first=John |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-northwestern-long-hours-1119-biz-20151119-story.html |accessdate=2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Duty hour restrictions ==
===Effects of duty hour restrictions===
Regulatory duty hour restrictions, in theory, should reduce the number of duty hours worked. In practice, they may not&lt;ref name=schultz&gt;{{Cite web| title = Medical Residents Work Long Hours Despite Rules| work = NPR.org| accessdate = 2016-05-06| url = https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/12/04/166477987/medical-residents-work-long-hours-despite-rules}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of [[Medical resident work hours#Problems with Duty Hour Restrictions|problems]]. Studies to evaluate the effects of duty hour restrictions on patient outcomes have been somewhat mixed.

Many of the studies rely on self-reported hours, self-reported errors, and self-reported sleep deprivation, with large opportunities for bias. More objective measures, such as tracking, perceptual tests, and blood hormone levels, are generally not used. Measurements of patient deaths and harm are often used as response variables. Many of the studies that have been done on this topic are specialty specific and so cannot be generalized to all medical residency programs.

===Observations on the ACGME restrictions in US===
The 2003 working-hour restrictions imposed in the US by the [[ACGME]] allowed many studies comparing patient outcomes before and after the reforms. They generally show little effect. This corresponds to the impressions of medical staff.

One 2014 systematic review of 135 studies spanning 1980 to 2013 showed no overall improvement in patient safety but still indicated that duty hour restrictions have increased morbidity in some cases.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Najma|last2=Devitt|first2=Katharine S.|last3=Keshet|first3=Itay|last4=Spicer|first4=Jonathan|last5=Imrie|first5=Kevin|last6=Feldman|first6=Liane|last7=Cools-Lartigue|first7=Jonathan|last8=Kayssi|first8=Ahmed|last9=Lipsman|first9=Nir|date=2014-06-01|title=A systematic review of the effects of resident duty hour restrictions in surgery: impact on resident wellness, training, and patient outcomes|journal=Annals of Surgery|volume=259|issue=6|pages=1041–1053|doi=10.1097/SLA.0000000000000595|issn=1528-1140|pmc=4047317|pmid=24662409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another systematic review of 27 studies conducted in 2015 found similar results, and a 2007 study of over 8 million hospital admissions of Medicare beneficiaries that compared mortality rate before and after implementation of the ACGME standards showed no difference in mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolster|first=Lauren|last2=Rourke|first2=Liam|date=2015-09-01|title=The Effect of Restricting Residents' Duty Hours on Patient Safety, Resident Well-Being, and Resident Education: An Updated Systematic Review|journal=Journal of Graduate Medical Education|volume=7|issue=3|pages=349–363|doi=10.4300/JGME-D-14-00612.1|issn=1949-8357|pmc=4597944|pmid=26457139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Volpp|first=Kevin G.|last2=Rosen|first2=Amy K.|last3=Rosenbaum|first3=Paul R.|last4=Romano|first4=Patrick S.|last5=Even-Shoshan|first5=Orit|last6=Wang|first6=Yanli|last7=Bellini|first7=Lisa|last8=Behringer|first8=Tiffany|last9=Silber|first9=Jeffrey H.|date=2007-09-05|title=Mortality among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries in the first 2 years following ACGME resident duty hour reform|journal=JAMA|volume=298|issue=9|pages=975–983|doi=10.1001/jama.298.9.975|issn=1538-3598|pmid=17785642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003 reform===
One study of 318,636 patients done in a Veterans Administration setting showed that work hour restrictions reduced mortality substantially for a similar set of diagnoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Volpp|first=Kevin G.|last2=Rosen|first2=Amy K.|last3=Rosenbaum|first3=Paul R.|last4=Romano|first4=Patrick S.|last5=Even-Shoshan|first5=Orit|last6=Canamucio|first6=Anne|last7=Bellini|first7=Lisa|last8=Behringer|first8=Tiffany|last9=Silber|first9=Jeffrey H.|date=2007-09-05|title=Mortality among patients in VA hospitals in the first 2 years following ACGME resident duty hour reform|journal=JAMA|volume=298|issue=9|pages=984–992|doi=10.1001/jama.298.9.984|issn=1538-3598|pmid=17785643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study found that the 2003 ACGME reform restrictions were associated with a small reduction in the relative risk for death in 1,268,738 non-surgical patients drawn from a national survey of hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shetty|first=Kanaka D.|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=Jayanta|date=2007-07-17|title=Changes in hospital mortality associated with residency work-hour regulations|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=147|issue=2|pages=73–80|issn=1539-3704|pmid=17548403|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-147-2-200707170-00161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 reform===
When surveyed about duty hour restrictions, both medical and surgical residents, as well as residency faculty perceive that patient safety hasn't changed or has suffered as a result.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sen|first=Srijan|last2=Kranzler|first2=Henry R.|last3=Didwania|first3=Aashish K.|last4=Schwartz|first4=Ann C.|last5=Amarnath|first5=Sudha|last6=Kolars|first6=Joseph C.|last7=Dalack|first7=Gregory W.|last8=Nichols|first8=Breck|last9=Guille|first9=Constance|date=2013-04-22|title=Effects of the 2011 duty hour reforms on interns and their patients: a prospective longitudinal cohort study|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=173|issue=8|pages=657–662; discussion 663|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.351|issn=2168-6114|pmc=4016974|pmid=23529201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fargen|first=Kyle M.|last2=Chakraborty|first2=Anindita|last3=Friedman|first3=William A.|date=2011-12-01|title=Results of a national neurosurgery resident survey on duty hour regulations|journal=Neurosurgery|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1162–1170|doi=10.1227/NEU.0b013e3182245989|issn=1524-4040|pmid=21606883}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choby|first=Beth|last2=Passmore|first2=Cindy|date=2007-06-01|title=Faculty perceptions of the ACGME resident duty hour regulations in family medicine|journal=Family Medicine|volume=39|issue=6|pages=392–398|issn=0742-3225|pmid=17549647}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=survey&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garg|first=Megha|last2=Drolet|first2=Brian C.|last3=Tammaro|first3=Dominick|last4=Fischer|first4=Staci A.|date=2014-10-01|title=Resident duty hours: a survey of internal medicine program directors|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|volume=29|issue=10|pages=1349–1354|doi=10.1007/s11606-014-2912-z|issn=1525-1497|pmc=4175662|pmid=24913004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many residents note an increase in self-reported errors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are a number of possible explanations for these results. See [[Medical resident work hours#Problems with Duty Hour Restrictions|Problems with duty hour restrictions]].

=== Problems with duty hour restrictions ===
It is largely felt that actual duty hours (opposed to reported duty hours) have not changed substantially: prior to the implementation of work hour regulations, residents were already working an average of 82 hours per week.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Czeisler, APSS 2009 6.9.09&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies rely on self-reported hours, but significant bias to under-report duty hours exists for a few important reasons: One is that statutes do not provide whistleblower protections to residents who report work hour violations. Second, the penalty for work hour violation is loss of accreditation, which would adversely affect medical residents and prevent them from becoming board certified. Finally, some residents may be pressured by their residency programs to underreport hours&lt;ref name=dishonesty&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fargen|first=Kyle M.|last2=Rosen|first2=Charles L.|date=2013-12-01|title=Are Duty Hour Regulations Promoting a Culture of Dishonesty Among Resident Physicians?|journal=Journal of Graduate Medical Education|volume=5|issue=4|pages=553–555|doi=10.4300/JGME-D-13-00220.1|issn=1949-8349|pmc=3886449|pmid=24454999}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even punished if they do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1001/jamasurg.2013.169| issn = 2168-6262| volume = 148| issue = 5| pages = 427–433| last1 = Drolet| first1 = Brian C.| last2 = Sangisetty| first2 = Suma| last3 = Tracy| first3 = Thomas F.| last4 = Cioffi| first4 = William G.| title = Surgical residents' perceptions of 2011 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education duty hour regulations| journal = JAMA Surgery| date =2013| pmid = 23677406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, these studies – particularly the ones that find favorable results - may fail to account for confounders that positively impact outcomes, including the wide adoption of electronic medical records, a shift toward team-based care, and implementation of best practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jena|first=Anupam B.|last2=Prasad|first2=Vinay|date=2013-09-01|title=Duty hour reform in a shifting medical landscape|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|volume=28|issue=9|pages=1238–1240|doi=10.1007/s11606-013-2439-8|issn=1525-1497|pmc=3744286|pmid=23568191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duty hour regulations may not address the root causes of medical errors, and may inadvertently create new problems that impact patient outcomes. In order to adhere to duty-hour standards, residents must handoff their patients to other residents more frequently, which can lead to miscommunication, interrupted continuity of care and increased errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borman|first=Karen R|last2=Jones|first2=Andrew T|last3=Shea|first3=Judy A|date=2012-07-01|title=Duty Hours, Quality of Care, and Patient Safety: General Surgery Resident Perceptions|journal=Journal of the American College of Surgeons|volume=215|issue=1|pages=70–77|doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2012.02.010|issn=1072-7515|pmc=3385860|pmid=22632914}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, most studies show that residents see more patients now, despite having less time, leading to more administrative work and less time for direct patient care and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Stuart H.|last2=Miller|first2=Robert H.|last3=Weng|first3=Cindy|last4=Gurgel|first4=Richard K.|date=2014-10-01|title=The effect of duty hour regulation on resident surgical case volume in otolaryngology|journal=Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery|volume=151|issue=4|pages=599–605|doi=10.1177/0194599814546111|issn=1097-6817|pmid=25135524}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hundert|first=Samuel A.|last2=White|first2=Andrew A.|last3=Reilly|first3=Dominic F.|date=2015-08-01|title=Number of General Medicine Hospital Admissions Performed by Internal Medicine Residents Before and After the 2011 Duty-Hour Regulations|journal=Southern Medical Journal|volume=108|issue=8|pages=476–481|doi=10.14423/SMJ.0000000000000323|issn=1541-8243|pmid=26280773}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One systematic review found that resident learning has been unfavorably impacted by duty hour regulations, and because medical education affects knowledge and competence, this may result in poor decision-making and medical errors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Proposed methods of reducing workloads ==
The most commonly proposed method is regulation of working hours, but this is ineffective if regulations are ignored. Whistle-blower protection laws, protecting residents who report violations of working-hour regulations from losing their residencies and thus their route to professional accreditation, have been proposed.&lt;ref name=Wilkey/&gt;

Increasing the bargaining power of residents has been proposed, on the argument that they would then choose the best training programs. The 2002 ''[[Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges]]'' anti-trust case sought more freedom for medical residents to negotiate working conditions. In order to obtain accreditation as doctors, American medical residents are required to enter into a contract to accept whatever residency position they are assigned; they are then matched to a job by the [[Association of American Medical Colleges|AAMC]] and told what the working conditions and pay are. The plaintiffs allege that this is an anti-competitive practice, and that the defendants artificially limit the number of resident positions available.&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;[http://www.law.uh.edu/healthlaw/perspectives/%28MT%29Jung3.pdf Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges: A Special Interest Victory], Miranda W. Turner, University of Houston Law Center,November 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinmayer&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1001/virtualmentor.2015.17.2.hlaw1-1502| volume = 17| issue = 2| pages = 149| last = Weinmeyer| first = Richard| title = Challenging the Medical Residency Matching System through Antitrust Litigation| journal = Virtual Mentor| accessdate = 2016-05-06| date = 2015-02-01| url = http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2015/02/hlaw1-1502.html| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150205045900/http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2015/02/hlaw1-1502.html| archivedate = 2015-02-05| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where there is a shortage of doctors, proposed solutions include reducing the costs of medical training and more extensive training for nurses, who then take over duties formerly done by doctors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.doleta.gov/performance/results/AnnualReports/PY2012/Healthcare%20Labor%20Shortages%20and%20Potential%20Solutions.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Improving the working conditions of doctors might also increase recruitment.

===Regulations===

====EU regulation====
Junior doctors in the [[European Union]] fall under the [[European Working Time Directive]], which specifies:

* 48 working hours per week (down from 56 under the old UK regulations), calculated over a period of 26 weeks.
* 11 hours continuous rest per day 
* one day off each week, or two days off each [[fortnight]] 
* 20 minutes of continuous rest every 6 hours

However, junior doctors may choose to work more than 48 hours a week, or opt out of the EWTD entirely by signing a waiver with the employer. They may not be punished for not working more than the directed hours.  Many trainees nonetheless feel obliged to work longer hours. The rest times are mandatory, but may be taken at another time if it cannot be taken as scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bma.org.uk/support-at-work/ewtd/ewtd-juniors&lt;/ref&gt;

====American regulation====
The issue is politically controversial in the [[United States]], where federal regulations did not limit the number of hours that can be assigned during a graduate medical student's [[medical residency]]. Starting in 2003, with revisions in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acgme.org/Portals/0/PDFs/dh-ComparisonTable2003v2011.pdf Regulation changes]&lt;/ref&gt; regulations from the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] capped the work-week at 80 hours. As of 2018, shifts are capped (with limited exceptions) at a maximum of 24 consecutive hours for first, second, and third year residents.&lt;ref name="WaPo28Oct2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2003rulesJAMA"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Philibert I, Friedmann P, Williams WT |title=New requirements for resident duty hours |journal=JAMA |volume=288 |issue=9 |pages=1112–4 |year=2002 |pmid=12204081 |doi= 10.1001/jama.288.9.1112|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2011rulesNEJM"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thomas J.

What's the Impact? NEJM Knowledge+|website=knowledgeplus.nejm.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has limited the number of work-hours to 80 hours weekly, overnight call frequency to no more than one in three, 30-hour maximum straight shifts, and at least 10 hours off between shifts.  While these limits are voluntary, adherence has been mandated for accreditation.

The [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) built upon the recommendations of the ACGME in the December 2008 report [https://archive.is/20121211093643/http://www.iom.edu/residenthours ''Resident Duty Hours: Enhancing Sleep, Supervision and Safety''.] While keeping the ACGME's recommendations of an 80-hour work week averaged over 4 weeks, the IOM report recommends that duty hours should not exceed 16 hours per shift for interns (PGY 1).  The IOM also recommended strategic napping between the hours of 10pm and 8am for shifts lasting up to 30 hours.  The ACGME officially recommended strategic napping between the hours of 10pm and 8am on 30 hour shifts for residents who are post graduate year 2 and above but did not make this a requirement for program compliance.   The report also suggests residents be given variable off-duty periods between shifts, based on the timing and duration of the shift, to allow residents to catch up on sleep each day and make up for chronic sleep deprivation on days off.

Though the ACGME regulations were intended to increase medical resident sleep hours and improve patient safety, they had also created unintended negative consequences in the education of new residents and the workplace learning culture. In 2017, the ACGME changed its regulations once again, citing a trial conducted from July 2014 to June 2015 in 117 general surgery residency programs.&lt;ref&gt;Asch, David A., et al. "Resident Duty Hours and Medical Education Policy — Raising the Evidence Bar." ''New England Journal of Medicine'', vol. 376, no. 18, May 2017, pp. 1704–06. ''Taylor and Francis+NEJM'', doi:10.1056/NEJMp1703690.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Flexibility in Duty Hour Requirements for Surgical Trainees (FIRST) trial, programs were randomly assigned to a group following current ACGME duty-hour restrictions or a group with more flexible policies that waived rules on maximum shift lengths and time off between shifts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Bilimoria KY, Chung JW, Hedges LV, et al. National cluster-randomized trial of duty-hour flexibility in surgical training. N Engl J Med 2016;374:713-727&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at primary outcomes of 30-day rate of postoperative death or serious complications, less-restrictive duty-hour policies were not associated with an increased rate of death or serious complications.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Starting July 1, 2017, the ACGME raised the maximum number of consecutive hours a first year resident can work from 16 hours to 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knowledgeplus.nejm.org/blog/acgme-duty-hours-not-the-only-big-change-in-requirements/|title=ACGME Duty Hours Have Changed. What's the Impact? NEJM Knowledge+|website=knowledgeplus.nejm.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the sleep deprivation medical residents constantly experience due to long working hours, a minority of residents still wish to not have work hour regulations at all.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the survey of 4510 obstetric-gynecologic residents, about one in five opposed any limits on their work hours.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These residents cited "additional experience" as the most common reason (69.0%), followed by "opportunity to see rare cases" (46.5%) and "continuity with patients" (31.8%).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=====Towards an 80-hour work week=====
The [[Libby Zion Law|Libby Zion case]], in which an 18-year-old college student died of a fatal drug interaction after being treated by a fatigued intern and resident in a New York hospital, led to the establishment of the Bell Commission in 1987 to address physician training hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=Nachiket|date=2014-12-30|title=Learning lessons: the Libby Zion case revisited|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|volume=64|issue=25|pages=2802–2804|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2014.11.007|issn=1558-3597|pmid=25541134}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its recommendations were adopted by the state of New York in 1989, and limited residents to no more than 24 consecutive hours in the hospital, and no more than 80 hours a week with an in-house supervising attending physician present at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/24/AR2006112400985.html|title=A Case That Shook Medicine|last=Lerner|first=Barron H.|date=2006-11-28|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though other federal regulatory and legislative attempts to limit medical resident work hours have materialized, none have attained passage.

Dr. Richard Corlin, president of the [[American Medical Association]], has called for re-evaluation of the residency training process, declaring "We need to take a look again at the issue of why is the resident there."&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) rejected a petition seeking to restrict medical resident work hours, opting to rely on standards adopted by ACGME, a private trade association that represents and accredits residency programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Medial Residents' Working Hours |url=http://www.citizen.org/hrg/healthcare/articles.cfm?ID=6666 |publisher=Public Citizen, Health Research Group |accessdate=2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 1, 2003, the ACGME instituted duty hours requirements for all accredited residency programs, since revised in 2011.&lt;ref name="ACGMEDutyHours"/&gt;

The ACGME duty hour standards that went into effect in July 2003 require:
# An 80-hour weekly limit, averaged over 4 weeks, inclusive of all in-house call activities;
# A 10-hour rest period between duty periods and after in-house call;
# A 24-hour limit on continuous duty, with up to 6 additional hours for continuity of care and education;
# No new patients to be accepted after 24 hours of continuous duty;
# One day in 7 free from patient care and educational obligations, averaged over 4 weeks, inclusive of call; and
# In-house call no more than once every 3 nights, averaged over 4 weeks.

Following the ACGME's proposed regulation of duty hours the [[American Osteopathic Association]] (AOA) followed suit. Below are the requirements adopted by the American Osteopathic association.&lt;ref&gt;"Accreditation Document for Postdoctoral Training Institutions and the Basic Document for Postdoctoral Training Programs."  2006.  Page 45 of 154.  [http://www.osteopathic.org/pdf/sir_postdoctrainproced.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

#The trainee shall not be assigned to work physically on duty in excess of 80 hours per week averaged over a 4-week period, inclusive of in-house night call.
#The trainee shall not work in excess of 24 consecutive hours inclusive of morning and noon educational programs. Allowances for inpatient and outpatient continuity, transfer of care, educational debriefing and formal didactic activities may occur, but may not exceed 6 hours. Residents may not assume responsibility for a new patient after working 24 hours.
#The trainee shall have on alternate weeks 48-hour periods off, or at least one 24-hour period off each week, averaged over a 4-week period.
#Upon conclusion of a 24-hour duty shift, trainees shall have a minimum of 10 hours off before being required to be on duty again. Upon completing a lesser hour duty period, adequate time for rest and personal activity must be provided.
#All off-duty time must be totally free from assignment to clinical or educational activity.
#Rotations in which trainee is assigned to Emergency Department duty shall ensure that trainees work no longer than 12-hour shifts.
#The trainee and training institution must always remember the patient care responsibility is not precluded by the work hour policy. In cases where a trainee is engaged in patient responsibility which cannot be interrupted, additional coverage should be provided as soon as possible to relieve the resident involved.
#The trainee may not be assigned to call more often than every third night averaged over any consecutive four-week period.

Another related issue regarding the imposition of maximum hour policies for medical residents is the question of enforcement, where some enforcement proposals have included extending U.S. federal whistle-blower protection to medical residents in order to ensure compliance and afford medical residents certain employment protection.&lt;ref name=Wilkey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilkey|first=Robert Neil|title=Federal Whistleblower Protection: A Means to Enforcing Maximum-Hour Legislation for Medical Residents|journal=William Mitchell Law Review|year=2003|volume=30|issue=1|url=http://open.wmitchell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070&amp;context=wmlr&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dmedical%2520residents%2520whistleblower%2520protection%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D1%26ved%3D0CF8QFjAA%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fopen.wmitchell.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1070%2526context%253Dwmlr%26ei%3D2b8NT76sEuLZ0QGn8cTZBQ%26usg%3DAFQjCNHfdcQ1oJI-5g27EWkk|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are still inherent problems with the current ACGME policy.  Resident duty hour restrictions are difficult to assess and enforce.  Also, it is unclear who is ultimately responsible for monitoring duty hour adherence (i.e. state licensing boards, residency programs, attendings, residents, etc.).  Additionally, a one-size-fits all solution may not be ideal, since the need for certain duty hours may vary among specialties.

==Coping mechanisms== 
Although strategic napping is recommended by the ACGME, no studies have assessed the effect of napping as a fatigue mitigation technique. Requiring naps during long shifts could be a small step toward reducing fatigue and potentially decreasing errors. Resident surveys suggest that a greater emphasis on education, decreased workload, and more ancillary support would better improve patient outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borman|first=Karen R.|last2=Jones|first2=Andrew T.|last3=Shea|first3=Judy A.|date=2012-07-01|title=Duty hours, quality of care, and patient safety: general surgery resident perceptions|journal=Journal of the American College of Surgeons|volume=215|issue=1|pages=70–77; discussion 77–79|doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2012.02.010|issn=1879-1190|pmc=3385860|pmid=22632914}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Focusing on hospital best practices and physician incentives like pay-for-performance in residency could help with the implementation of some of these solutions.

Techniques to reduce circadian misalignment include avoiding abrupt changes in shift time, getting more sleep, which makes the sleep schedule more flexible, and the use of caffeine and ambient light of specific wavelengths.&lt;ref name=float/&gt;&lt;ref name=ICU/&gt;

'''Mondex''' is a [[smart card]] [[electronic cash]] system, implemented as a [[stored-value card]].

Mondex was conceived by Tim Jones and Graham Higgins of the [[NatWest|National Westminster Bank]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The system was initially developed between 1990 and 1993, with internal trials being carried out by approximately 6,000 London-based NatWest staff from 1992. The system was publicly unveiled in December 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wings.buffalo.edu/academic/department/som/isinterface/is_syllabus/mondex/mondex.html |title=Mondex International:  Reengineering MoneyII |access-date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial public trials of the payment system were carried out from July 1995, by the newly incorporated Mondex International in [[Swindon]], [[Wiltshire]]. The public phase had required the development and manufacture of numerous merchant devices and smart cards, with [[BT Group|BT]], NatWest and the [[Midland Bank]] sponsoring and installing retail terminals at the car parks, payphones, buses and 700 of the merchants in the town, and issuing Mondex cards to the residents. The system was subsequently sold to [[MasterCard|MasterCard International]] in 2001. MasterCard by then already owned 49% of the company.

Mondex launched in a number of markets during the 1990s, expanding from the original trial in Swindon to [[Hong Kong]], [[New York City|New York]] and [[Guelph]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="globeandmail"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/media/globe.01nov98.html |title=Mondex pulls plug on Guelph pilot project |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |location=Toronto |date=31 October 1998 |accessdate=28 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also trialled on several British university campuses from the late 1990s, including the [[University of Edinburgh]], [[University of Exeter]] (between 1997 and 2001), [[University of York]], [[University of Nottingham]], [[Aston University]] and [[Sheffield Hallam University]]. Mondex's Canadian pilot ended after three years, in 1998, when partners backed out.&lt;ref name="globeandmail"/&gt;

The [[Z notation]] was used to prove security properties about Mondex, allowing it to achieve [[ITSEC]] level E6, ITSEC's highest granted security-level classification.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Stepney, David Cooper, and [[Jim Woodcock]], ''[http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~susan/bib/ss/z/prg126.pdf An Electronic Purse: Specification, Refinement, and Proof]''.[http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/publications/monos/prg-126.html Technical Monograph PRG-126], [[Programming Research Group]], [[Oxford University]], UK, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Woodcock]], Susan Stepney, David Cooper, John Clark, and Jeremy Jacob, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00165-007-0060-5 The certification of the Mondex electronic purse to ITSEC Level E6], ''[[Formal Aspects of Computing]]'', Volume 20, Number 1, pages 5–19, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''mySky''' is a personal [[astronomy]] tool made by [[Meade Instruments]]. When pointed at an area of sky, it can identify objects based on its built-in database of 30000 objects. It can also guide the user to a particular object from its database. It has an [[LCD]] display, incorporates [[GPS]] technology and can be linked to a compatible Meade computer-controllable [[telescope]]. Note, however, that mySky is not a telescope or observing instrument.

The current model of this device no longer incorporates the GPS functionality. There were lots of complaints about that feature not working. Now, apparently, you either enter your Lat/Long manually or select from a list of cities.

'''Mycotoxicology''' is the branch of [[mycology]] that focuses on analyzing and studying the [[toxins]] produced by [[fungi]], known as [[mycotoxins]].&lt;ref name=Bennett87&gt;Bennett, J. W. 1987. Mycotoxins, mycotoxicoses, mycotoxicology and mycopathology. Mycopathlogia 100:3-5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the food industry it is important to adopt measures that keep mycotoxin levels as low as practicable, especially those that are heat-stable. These chemical compounds are the result of secondary metabolism initiated in response to specific developmental or environmental signals. This includes biological stress from the environment, such as lower nutrients or competition for those available. Under this secondary path the fungus produces a wide array of compounds in order to gain some level of advantage, such as incrementing the efficiency of metabolic processes to gain more energy from less food, or attacking other microorganisms and being able to use their remains as a food source. 

Mycotoxins are made by fungi and are toxic to vertebrates and other animal groups in low concentrations. Low-molecular-weight fungal metabolites such as ethanol that are toxic only in high concentrations are not considered mycotoxins. Mushroom poisons are fungal metabolites that can cause disease and death in humans and other animals; they are rather arbitrarily excluded from discussions of mycotoxicology. Molds make mycotoxins; mushrooms and other macroscopic fungi make mushroom poisons. The distinction between a mycotoxin and a mushroom poison is based not only on the size of the producing fungus, but also on human intention. Mycotoxin exposure is almost always accidental. In contrast, with the exception of the victims of a few mycologically accomplished murderers, mushroom poisons are usually ingested by amateur mushroom hunters who have collected, cooked, and eaten what was misidentified as a harmless, edible species.&lt;ref name=Moss96&gt;Moss, M. O. 1996. Mycotoxins. Mycol. Res. 100:513-523.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mycotoxins are hard to define and are also very difficult to classify. Mycotoxins have diverse chemical structures, biosynthetic origins, myriad biological effects, and produce numerous different fungal species. Classification generally reflects the training of the categorizer and does not adhere to any set system. Mycotoxins are often arranged by physicians depending on what organ they effect. Mycotoxins can be categorized as nephrotoxins, hepatoxins, immunotoxins, neurotoxins, etc. Generic groups created by cell biologist are teratogens, mutagens, allergens, and carcinogens. Organic chemists have attempted to classify them by their chemical structures (e.g., lactones, coumarins); biochemists according to their biosynthetic origins (polyketides, amino acid-derived, etc.); physicians by the illnesses they cause (e.g., St. Anthony's fire, stachybotryotoxicosis), and mycologists by the fungi that produce them (e.g., Aspergillus toxins, Penicillium toxins).None of these classifications is entirely satisfactory. Aflatoxin, for example, is a hepatotoxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, difuran-containing, polyketide-derived Aspergillus toxin. Zearalenone is a Fusarium metabolite with potent estrogenic activity; hence, in addition to being called (probably erroneously) a mycotoxin, it also has been labeled a phytoestrogen, a mycoestrogen, and a growth promotant.&lt;ref&gt;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2003 July; 16(3): 497–516.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of Mycotoxins ==
'''[[Citrinin]]''': Citrinin was first isolated from Penicillium citrinum prior to World War II;&lt;ref&gt;Hetherington, A. C., and H. Raistrick. 1931. Studies in the biochemistry of microorganisms. Part XIV. On the production and chemical constitution of a new yellow colouring matter, citrinin, produced from glucose by Penicillium citrinum Thom. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. London Ser. B 220B:269-295.&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently, it was identified in over a dozen species of Penicillium and several species of Aspergillus (e.g., Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus niveus), including certain strains of Penicillium camemberti (used to produce cheese) and Aspergillus oryzae (used to produce sake, miso, and soy sauce).&lt;ref&gt;Manabe, M. 2001. Fermented foods and mycotoxins. Mycotoxins 51:25-28&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, citrinin has also been isolated from Monascus ruber and Monascus purpureus, industrial species used to produce red pigments.&lt;ref&gt;Blanc, P. J., M. O. Loret, and G. Goma. 1995. Production of citrinin by various species of Monascus. Biotechnol. Lett. 17:291-294.&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''[[Aflatoxins]]''': The aflatoxins were isolated and characterized after the death of more than 100,000 turkey poults ([[turkey X disease]]) was traced to the consumption of a mold-contaminated peanut meal.&lt;ref&gt;Blout, W. P. 1961. Turkey “X” disease. Turkeys 9:52, 55-58, 61, 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldblatt, L. (ed.). 1969. Aflatoxin. scientific background, control, and implications. Academic Press, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; The four major aflatoxins are called B1, B2, G1, and G2 based on their fluorescence under UV light (blue or green) and relative chromatographic mobility during thin-layer chromatography. Aflatoxin B1 is the most potent natural carcinogen known &lt;ref&gt;Squire, R. A. 1981. Ranking animal carcinogens: a proposed regulatory approach. Science 214:877-880&lt;/ref&gt; and is usually the major aflatoxin produced by toxigenic strains. It is also the best studied: in a large percentage of the papers published, the term aflatoxin can be construed to mean aflatoxin B1. However, well over a dozen other aflatoxins (e.g., P1. Q1, B2a, and G2a) have been described, especially as mammalian biotransformation products of the major metabolites.&lt;ref&gt;Heathcote, J. G., and J. R. Hibbert. 1978. Aflatoxins: chemical and biological aspects. Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company, Amsterdam, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; The classic book Aflatoxin: Scientific Background, Control, and Implications, published in 1969, is still a valuable resource for reviewing the history, chemistry, toxicology, and agricultural implications of aflatoxin research. 

'''[[Fumonisins]]''': Fumonisins were first described and characterized in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Bezuidenhout, S. C., W. C. A. Gelderblom, C. P. Gorst-Allman, R. M. Horak, W. F. O. Marasas; G. Spiteller, and R. Vleggaar. 1988. Structure elucidation of the fumonisins, mycotoxins from Fusarium moniliforme. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1988:743-745.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bezuidenhout, S. C., W. C. A. Gelderblom, C. P. Gorst-Allman, R. M. Horak, W. F. O. Marasas; G. Spiteller, and R. Vleggaar. 1988. Structure elucidation of the fumonisins, mycotoxins from Fusarium moniliforme. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1988:743-745.&lt;/ref&gt; The most abundantly produced member of the family is fumonisin B1. They are thought to be synthesized by condensation of the amino acid alanine into an acetate-derived precursor.&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney, M. J., and A. D. W. Dobson. 1999. Molecular biology of mycotoxin production. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 175:149-163.&lt;/ref&gt; Fumonisins are produced by a number of Fusarium species, notably Fusarium verticillioides (formerly Fusarium moniliforme = Gibberella fujikuroi), Fusarium proliferatum, and Fusarium nygamai, as well as Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici.&lt;ref&gt;Rheeder, J. P., W. F. Marasas, and H. F. Vismer. 2002. Production of fumonisin analogs by Fusarium species. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 68:2102-2105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marasas, W. F. O., J. D. Miller, R. T. Riley, and A. Visconti. 2001. Fumonisins—occurrence, toxicology, metabolism and risk assessment, p, 332-359. In B. A. Summerell, J. F. Leslie, D. Backhouse, W. L. Bryden, and L. W. Burgess (ed.), Fusarium. Paul E. Nelson Memorial Symposium. APS Press, St. Paul, Minn.&lt;/ref&gt; These fungi are taxonomically challenging, with a complex and rapidly changing nomenclature which has perplexed many nonmycologists (and some mycologists, too).&lt;ref&gt;Marasas, W. F. O., P. E. Nelson, and T. A. Toussoun. 1984. Toxigenic Fusarium species: identity and mycotoxicology. The Pennsylvania State University Press, University Park, Pa.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, J. F. 1996. Introductory biology of Fusarium moniliforme, p. 153-164. In L. S. Jackson, J. W. DeVries, and L. B. Bullerman (ed.), Fumonisins in food. Plenum Press, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; The major species of economic importance is Fusarium verticillioides, which grows as a corn endophyte in both vegetative and reproductive tissues, often without causing disease symptoms in the plant. However, when weather conditions, insect damage, and the appropriate fungal and plant genotype are present, it can cause seedling blight, stalk rot, and ear rot.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, P. E., A. E. Desjardins, and R. D. Plattner. 1993. Fumonisins, mycotoxins produced by Fusarium species: biology, chemistry and significance. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 31:233-252.&lt;/ref&gt; Fusarium verticillioides is present in virtually all corn samples.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, E. 1983. Yellow rain experts battle over corn mold. Science 221:526-529.&lt;/ref&gt; Most strains do not produce the toxin, so the presence of the fungus does not necessarily mean that fumonisin is also present.&lt;ref&gt;Plumlee, K. H., and F. D. Galey. 1994. Neurotoxic mycotoxins: A review of fungal toxins that cause neurological disease in large animals. J. Vet. Intern. Med. 8:49-54&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is phytotoxic, fumonisin B1 is not required for plant pathogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;Marasas, W. F. O. 1996. Fumonsins: history, world-wide occurrence and impact, p. 1-17. In L. S. Jackson, J. W. DeVries, and L. B. Bullerman (ed.), Fumonosins in food. Plenum Press, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desjardins, A. E., and R. D. Plattner. 2000. Fumonisin B (1)-nonproducing strains of Fusarium verticillioides cause maize (Zea mays) ear infection and ear rot. J. Agric. Food Chem. 48:5773-5780&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''[[Ochratoxin]]''': Ochratoxin A was discovered as a metabolite of Aspergillus ochraceus in 1965 during a large screen of fungal metabolites that was designed specifically to identify new mycotoxins.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Merwe, K. J., P. S. Steyne, L. F. Fourie, D. B. Scott, and J. J. Theron. 1965. Ochratoxin A, a toxic metabolite produced by Aspergillus ochraceus Wilh. Nature 205:1112-1113&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, it was isolated from a commercial corn sample in the United States &lt;ref&gt;Shotwell, L. L., C. W. Hesseltine, and M. L. Goulden. 1969. Ochratoxin A: occurrence as natural contaminant of a corn sample. Appl. Microbiol. 17:765-766&lt;/ref&gt; and recognized as a potent nephrotoxin. Members of the ochratoxin family have been found as metabolites of many different species of Aspergillus, including Aspergillus alliaceus, Aspergillus auricomus, Aspergillus carbonarius, Aspergillus glaucus, Aspergillus melleus, and Aspergillus niger.&lt;ref&gt;Abarca, M. L., M. R. Bragulat, G. Sastella, and F. J. Cabanes. 1994. Ochratoxin A production by strains of Aspergillus niger var. niger. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60:2650-2652.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bayman, P., J. L. Baker, M. A. Doster, T. J. Michailides and, N. E. Mahoney. 2002. Ochratoxin production by the Aspergillus ochraceus group and Aspergillus alliaceus. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 68:2326-2329.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ciegler, A., D. J. Fennell, H. J. Mintzlaff, and L. Leistner. 1972. Ochratoxin synthesis by Penicillium species. Naturwissenschaften 59:365-366&lt;/ref&gt; Because Aspergillus niger is used widely in the production of enzymes and citric acid for human consumption, it is important to ensure that industrial strains are nonproducers.&lt;ref&gt;Heenan, C. N., K. J. Shaw, and J. I. Pitt. 1998. Ochratoxin A production by Aspergillus carbonarius and A. niger isolates and detection using coconut cream agar. J. Food Mycol. 1:67-72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teren, J., J. Varga, Z. Hamari, E. Rinyu, and F. Kevei. 1996. Immunochemical detection of ochratoxin A in black Aspergillus strains. Mycopathologia 134:171-186&lt;/ref&gt; Although some early reports implicated several Penicillium species, it is now thought that Penicillium verrucosum, a common contaminant of barley, is the only confirmed ochratoxin producer in this genus.&lt;ref&gt;Pitt, J. I. 1987. Penicillium viridicatum, Penicillium verrucosum, and production of ochratoxin A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 53:266-269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chu, F. S. 1974. Studies on ochratoxins. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 2:499-524&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many mycotoxin reviews reiterate erroneous species lists.

'''[[Patulin]]''': Patulin, 4-hydroxy-4H-furo[3,2c]pyran-2(6H)-one, is produced by many different molds but was first isolated as an antimicrobial active principle during the 1940s from Penicillium patulum (later called Penicillium urticae, now Penicillium griseofulvum). The same metabolite was also isolated from other species and given the names clavacin, claviformin, expansin, mycoin c, and penicidin.&lt;ref&gt;Ciegler, A., R. W. Detroy, and E. B. Lillejoj. 1971. Patulin, penicillic acid and other carcinogenic lactones, p. 409-434. In A. Ciegler, S. Kadis and S. J. Ajl (ed.), Microbial toxins, vol. VI: fungal toxins. Academic Press. New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of early studies were directed towards harnessing its antibiotic activity. For example, it was tested as both a nose and throat spray for treating the common cold and as an ointment for treating fungal skin infections&lt;ref&gt;Ciegler, A. 1977. Patulin, p. 609-624. In J. V. Rodricks, C. W. Hesseltine, and M. A. Mehlman (ed.), Mycotoxins in human and animal health. Pathotox Publishers, Inc., Park Forest South, Ill.&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the 1950s and 1960s, it became apparent that, in addition to its antibacterial, antiviral, and antiprotozoal activity, patulin was toxic to both plants and animals, precluding its clinical use as an antibiotic. During the 1960s, patulin was reclassified as a mycotoxin. 

'''[[Trichothecenes]]''': The trichothecenes constitute a family of more than sixty sesquiterpenoid metabolites produced by a number of fungal genera, including Fusarium, Myrothecium, Phomopsis, Stachybotrys, Trichoderma, Trichothecium, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, R. J., and R. H. Cox. 1981. Handbook of toxic fungal metabolites. Academic Press, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott, P. M. 1989. The natural occurrence of trichothecenes, p. 1-26. In V. H. Beasley (ed.), Trichothecene mycotoxicosis: pathophysiologic effects, vol. I. CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ueno, Y. (ed.). 1983. Trichothecenes: chemical, biological and toxicological aspects. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; The term trichothecene is derived from trichothecin, which was the one of the first members of the family identified. All trichothecenes contain a common 12,13-epoxytrichothene skeleton and an olefinic bond with various side chain substitutions. They are commonly found as food and feed contaminants, and consumption of these mycotoxins can result in alimentary hemorrhage and vomiting; direct contact causes dermatitis.&lt;ref&gt;Beasley, V. R.

'''[[Zearalenone]]''': Zearalenone (6-[10-hydroxy-6-oxo-trans-1-undecenyl]-B-resorcyclic acid lactone), a secondary metabolite from Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae) was given the trivial name zearalenone as a combination of G. zeae, resorcylic acid lactone, -ene (for the presence of the C-1′ to C-2 double bond), and -one, for the C-6′ ketone.&lt;ref&gt;Urry, W. H., H. L. Wehrmeister, E. B. Hodge, and P. H. Hidy. 1966. The structure of zearalenone. Tetrahedron Lett. 27:3109-3114&lt;/ref&gt; Almost simultaneously, a second group isolated, crystallized, and studied the metabolic properties of the same compound and named it F-2.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, C. M., G. H. Nelson, and C. J. Mirocha. 1965. Effect on the white rat uterus of a toxic substance isolated from Fusarium. Appl. Microbiol. 13:653-659&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mirocha, C. J., C. M. Christensen, and G. H. Nelson. 1967. Estrogenic metabolite produced by Fusarium graminearum in stored grain. Appl. Microbiol. 15:497-503&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the early literature uses zearalenone and F-2 as synonyms; the family of analogues are known as zearalenones and F-2 toxins, respectively. Perhaps because the original work on these fungal macrolides coincided with the discovery of aflatoxins, chapters on zearalenone have become a regular fixture in monographs on mycotoxins (see, for example, Mirocha and Christensen &lt;ref&gt;Mirocha, C. J., and C. M. Christensen. 1974. Oestrogenic mycotoxins synthesized by Fusarium, p. 129-148. In I. F. H. Purchase (ed.), Mycotoxins. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; and Betina &lt;ref&gt;Betina, V. 1989. Bioactive molecules vol. 9. Mycotoxins: chemical, biological and environmental aspects. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;). Nevertheless, the word toxin is almost certainly a misnomer because zearalenone, while biologically potent, is hardly toxic; rather, it sufficiently resembles 17β-estradiol, the principal hormone produced by the human ovary, to allow it to bind to estrogen receptors in mammalian target cells &lt;ref&gt;Kuiper-Goodman, T., P. M. Scott, and H. Watanabe. 1987. Risk assessment of the mycotoxin zearalenone. Regul. Toxicol. Pharmacol. 7:253-306&lt;/ref&gt; Zearalenone is better classified as a nonsteroidal estrogen or mycoestrogen. Sometimes it is called a phytoestrogen. For the structure-activity relationships of zearalenone and its analogues, see Hurd &lt;ref&gt;Hurd, R. N. 1977. Structure activity relationships in zearalenones, p. 379-391. In J. V. Rodricks, C. W. Hesseltine, and M. A. Mehlman (ed.), Mycotoxins in human and animal health. Pathotox Publications, Inc., Park Forest South, Ill.&lt;/ref&gt; and Shier.&lt;ref&gt;Shier, W. T. 1998.

'''Nanoprobing''' is method of extracting device [[Current–voltage characteristic|electrical parameters]] through the use of nanoscale tungsten wires, used primarily in the semiconductor industry. The characterization of individual devices is instrumental to engineers and [[integrated circuit]] designers during initial product development and debug. It is commonly utilized in device [[failure analysis]] laboratories to aid with yield enhancement, quality and reliability issues and customer returns. Commercially available nanoprobing systems are integrated into either a vacuum-based [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM) or [[atomic force microscope]] (AFM). Nanoprobing systems that are based on AFM technology are referred to as Atomic Force nanoProbers (AFP).

== Principles and operation ==
AFM based nanoprobers, enable up to eight probe tips to be scanned to generate high resolution AFM topography images, as well as Conductive AFM, Scanning Capacitance, and Electrostatic Force Microscopy images. Conductive AFM provides pico-amp resolution to identify and localize electrical failures such as shorts, opens, resistive contacts and leakage paths, enabling accurate probe positioning for current-voltage measurements. AFM based nanoprobers enable nanometer scale device defect localization and accurate transistor device characterization without the physical damage and electrical bias induced by high energy electron beam exposure.

[[File:Nanoprobes Over SRAM devices.jpg|thumb|right|A high magnification image of tungsten nanoprobes landed on a [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]] device.]]
For SEM based nanoprobers, the ultra-high resolution of the microscopes that house the nanoprobing system allow the operator to navigate the probe tips with precise movement, allowing the user to see exactly where the tips will be landed, in real time. Existing nanoprobe needles or “probe tips” have a typical end-point radius ranging from 5 to 35&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Toh | first1 = S. L. | last2 = Tan | first2 = P.

Navigation of the probe tips in SEM based nanoprobers are typically controlled by precision [[piezoelectric]] manipulators. Typical systems have anywhere from 2 to 8 probe manipulators with high end tools having better than 5&amp;nbsp;nm of placement resolution in the X, Y &amp; Z axes and a high accuracy sample stage for navigation of the sample under test.

A '''natural building''' involves a range of [[building]] systems and materials that place major emphasis on [[sustainability]].  Ways of achieving sustainability through natural building focus on durability and the use of minimally processed, plentiful or [[renewable resource]]s, as well as those that, while [[Recycling|recycled]] or salvaged, produce healthy living environments and maintain indoor air quality. Natural building tends to rely on human labor, more than technology. As Michael G. Smith observes, it depends on "local ecology, geology and climate; on the character of the particular building site, and on the needs and personalities of the builders and users."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael G. "The Case for Natural Building," in Kennedy, Smith and Wanek (2002), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis of natural building is the need to lessen the [[natural environment|environmental]] impact of buildings and other supporting systems, without sacrificing comfort or health. To be more sustainable, natural building uses primarily abundantly available, renewable, reused or recycled materials.  The use of rapidly renewable materials is increasingly a focus. In addition to relying on natural building materials, the emphasis on the architectural design is heightened. The orientation of a building, the utilization of local climate and site conditions, the emphasis on natural ventilation through design, fundamentally lessen operational costs and positively impact the environment. Building compactly and minimizing the [[ecological footprint]] is common, as are on-site handling of energy acquisition, on-site water capture, alternate sewage treatment and water reuse.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
[[Image:timber frame detail.jpg|thumb|right|400px|&lt;center&gt;Porch of a modern timber framed home&lt;/center&gt;]]

==Materials==
The materials common to many types of natural building are clay and sand.  When mixed with water and, usually, straw or another fiber, the mixture may form ''[[cob (material)|cob]]'' or ''[[adobe]]'' (clay blocks).  Other materials commonly used in natural building are: earth (as [[rammed earth]] or [[Earthbag construction|earth bag]]), wood ([[cordwood construction|cordwood]] or [[timber frame]]/post-and-beam), [[straw-bale construction|straw]], rice-hulls, [[bamboo]] and [[rock (geology)|stone]]. A wide variety of reused or [[recycled]] non-toxic materials are common in natural building, including urbanite (salvaged chunks of used concrete), vehicle windscreens and other recycled glass.

Other materials are avoided by practitioners of this building approach, due to their major negative environmental or health impacts.  These include unsustainably harvested wood, toxic wood-preservatives, [[portland cement]]-based mixes and derived products such as [[Autoclaved aerated concrete]], paints and other coatings that off-gas [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs), steel, waste materials such as rubber tires in regions where they are recycled, and some plastics; particularly [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC or "vinyl") and those containing harmful plasticizers or hormone-mimicking formulations.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Techniques==
Many traditional techniques and materials are now experiencing a resurgence of popularity. This differs around the world based on climate appropriate building design and the availability of local materials.

===Adobe===
{{Main|Adobe|Mudbrick}}

One of the oldest building methods, adobe is simply clay and sand mixed with water. Often, chopped straw or other fibers are added for strength. The mixture is then allowed to dry in the desired shape. Usually adobe is shaped into bricks that can be stacked to form walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chiras|first=Daniel D.|title=The Natural House: A Complete Guide to Healthy, Energy-efficient, Environmental Homes|year=2000|publisher=Chelsea Green Pub.|location=White River Junction, Vt.|isbn=978-1-890132-57-6|pages=127–128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_Y2AObA-joC&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=adobe%20bricks%20walls&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various claims are made about the optimal proportions of clay and sand (or larger aggregate). Some say that the best adobe soil contains 15% - 30% clay to bind the material together. Others say equal proportions of clay and sand are best to prevent cracking or fragmenting of the bricks. The blocks can either be poured into molds and dried, or pressed into blocks. Adobe colored with clay and polished with natural oil makes an attractive and resilient floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Scott|title=The Workshop: Celebrating the Place Where Craftsmanship Begins|year=2003|publisher=Taunton Press|location=Newton, CT|isbn=978-1-56158-575-5|page=172|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WJJYdkQw_uYC&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=adobe%20floor%20oil&amp;pg=PA172#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Anthony, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To protect the walls and reduce maintenance, adobe buildings usually have large overhanging eaves and sizeable foundations. Adobe can be plastered over with cob or lime-based mixes for both appearance and protection.  Adobe has good thermal mass, meaning that it is slow to transmit heat or cold. It is not a good insulator, however, so insulation can be added (preferably on the outside), or a double wall built with airspace or insulation in between.  The traditional thick, un-insulated adobe has proven to perform best in regions without harsh winters or where daily sun is predictably available during those cold periods.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Cob===
{{Main|Cob (building)}}
[[File:Cob with living roof.jpg|thumb|A small cob building with a [[living roof]]]]
The term ''cob'' is used to describe a monolithic building system based on a mixture of clay, sand, straw and earth. The construction uses no forms, bricks or wooden framework; it is built from the ground up. Various forms of "mud" building have been used in many parts of the world for centuries, under a variety of names, and date from at least 10,000 years ago. Cob building began use in England prior to the 13th century, and fell out of favor after World War I, although it is seeing a resurgence today. Cob is one of the simplest and least expensive building techniques available, though it is typically very labor-intensive. Cob's other great advantage is versatility; It can easily be shaped into any form.  While cob building was falling out of favor in England by the late 19th century, thousands of cob structures have endured to the present (20,000 in [[Devon]], England alone).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael G. "Cob Building, Ancient and Modern," in Kennedy, Smith and Wanek, (2002), 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is estimated that from one third to one half of the world's population lives in earthen dwellings today.  Although typically associated with "low-rise" structures, in [[Yemen]] and other Middle-Eastern countries it has, for centuries, been used in "apartment" buildings of eight stories and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Ianto|title=The Hand-sculpted House|year=2002|publisher=Chelsea Green Pub. Co.|location=White River Junction, Vt.|isbn=978-1-890132-34-7|page=xv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGEmmolyeSUC&amp;lpg=PR15&amp;dq=yemen%20cob%20apartment&amp;pg=PR15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cob-like mixes are also used as plaster or filler in several methods of natural building, such as adobe, earth bags, timber frames, cordwood, and straw bales. Earth is thus a primary ingredient of natural building.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Cordwood===
{{Main|Cordwood construction}}
[[Image:Cordwoodhouse.jpg|150px|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;A section of a cordwood home.]]
'''Cordwood construction''' is a term used for a natural building method in which "cordwood" or short lengths of pieces of debarked tree are laid up crosswise with [[masonry]] or [[Cob (building)|cob]] mixtures to build a wall. The cordwood, thus, becomes infill for the walls, usually between posts in a [[timber frame]] structure. Cordwood masonry can be combined with other methods  (e.g., [[rammed earth]], cob or [[light clay]]) to produce attractive combinations. Cordwood masonry construction provides a relatively high [[thermal mass]], which helps to minimise fluctuations in temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chiras|first=Daniel D.|title=The Natural House: A Complete Guide to Healthy, Energy-efficient, Environmental Homes|year=2000|publisher=Chelsea Green Pub.|location=White River Junction, Vt.|isbn=978-1-890132-57-6|pages=178–179|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_Y2AObA-joC&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;dq=cordwood%20thermal%20mass&amp;pg=PA178#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earthbag===
{{Main|Earthbag construction|Super Adobe}}

Earth is the most typical fill material used in bag-wall construction techniques.  This building method utilizes stacked polypropylene or natural-fiber (burlap) bags filled with earth or other mixes without a stabilizer, other than clay, to form footings, foundations, walls and even vaulted or domed roofs. In recent years, building with earth bags has become one of the increasingly practiced techniques in natural building. It facilitates self-contained, often free-form rammed-earth structures. Its growing popularity relates to its use of an abundant and readily available often site-available material (earth) in a potentially inexpensive building technique that is flexible, and easy to learn and use.  However, because earth is a poor insulator, in more extreme climates other filler variations are now being explored, substituting pumice, rice-hulls or another material with better insulating value for all or part of the earth (''see also'' [[Rice-hull bagwall construction]]).{{refimprove|date=June 2012}}

=== Hempcrete ===
[[Hempcrete]] or Hemplime is bio-composite material, a mixture of [[hemp hurds]] (shives) and [[Lime (material)|lime]] (possibly including [[hydraulic lime|natural hydraulic lime]],&lt;ref&gt;Allin, Steve. ''Building with Hemp'', Seed Press, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-9551109-0-0}}. (p. 146, 1st Edition).&lt;/ref&gt; [[sand]], [[pozzolan]]s) used as a material for construction and [[Building insulation|insulation]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is marketed under names like Hempcrete, Canobiote, Canosmose, and Isochanvre.&lt;ref name="Priesnitz"&gt;{{cite journal
|url=http://www.naturallifemagazine.com/0604/hemphouse.htm |title=Hemp For Houses |first=Rolf B. |last=Priesnitz |work=Natural Life Magazine |date=March–April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hempcrete is easier to work with than traditional lime mixes and acts as an insulator and moisture regulator. It lacks the [[brittleness]] of concrete and consequently does not need [[expansion joint]]s.&lt;ref name="Priesnitz"/&gt; The result is a lightweight insulating material ideal for most climates as it combines insulation and thermal mass.

Like other plant products, [[hemp]] absorbs [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] from the atmosphere as it grows, retaining the [[carbon]] and releasing the [[oxygen]].  Theoretically 165&amp;nbsp;kg of carbon can be absorbed and locked up by 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of hempcrete wall during manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanlimetec.com/tradical-hemcrete/|title=Tradical Hemcrete 2008 Information Pack|publisher=American Lime Technology|accessdate=2010-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore the carbonation of the lime during curing adds to this effect as lime turns to [[limestone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minoeco.com/en/constructions/hempcrete|title=Minoeco - Natural Plasters &amp; Bioclimatic Design, Hempcrete|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rammed earth===
{{Main|Rammed earth}}
Rammed earth is a wall system made of compacted earth, or another material that is compacted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pise Pisé terminology]&lt;/ref&gt; It is extremely strong and durable. Quality rammed earth walls are dense, solid, and stone-like with great environmental benefits and superior low maintenance characteristics.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} As an option depending on climate rigid insulation can be placed inside the wall. Similarly, depending on seismic concerns bamboo or other tensile natural materials can be used to reinforce the wall.

Rammed earth has been used for around 10,000 years in all types of buildings from low rise to high-rise and from small huts to palaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Rammed earth walls are formed in place by pounding damp sub-soil (containing sand, clay and sometimes gravel) into movable, reusable forms with manual or machine-powered tampers. In traditional rammed earth, a mixture of around 70% aggregate (gravel,sand) and 30% clay is optimal. Pigmentation may be added in the mix to achieve the desired color. Around 5-10&amp;nbsp;inches of mixed damp sub-soil are placed inside the forms and pounded to total compaction and the process is repeated until the desired height is achieved. What is left after the forms are removed is a wall that is structural and can last over 1000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Stone===


Stone has been used as a building material for thousands of years. It has long been recognized as a material of great durability. The pyramids in Giza, burial chambers in the UK and temples in Malta were all built from stone over 4000 years ago and are still standing. The earliest form of stone construction is known as dry stone, or dry stacking. These are freestanding structures such as field walls, bridges and buildings that use irregularly shaped stones carefully selected and placed so that they fit closely together without slipping. Structures are typically wider at the base and taper in as height increases. They do not require any special tools, only the skill of the craftsman in choosing and placing the stones.

Traditional stone masonry evolved from dry stone stacking. Stone blocks are laid in rows of even (courses) or uneven (un-coursed) height, and fixed in place with lime mortar pasted between the stones. Traditional stone masonry is rarely used today because stone is expensive to quarry, cut and transport, and the building process is labor and skill-intensive. 

Stone is a highly durable, low maintenance building material with high thermal mass. It is versatile, available in many shapes, sizes, colors and textures, and can be used for floors, walls, arches and roofs. Stone blends well with the [[natural landscape]], and can easily be recycled for other building purposes.

===Straw bale===
{{Main|Straw bale construction}}
[[Image:strawbaleconstruction.jpg|thumb|right|300px|&lt;center&gt;Straw bale construction in Santa Cruz, CA&lt;/center&gt;]]

Although [[grasses]] and [[straw]] have been in use in a range of ways in building since pre-history around the world, their incorporation in machine-manufactured modular [[Baler|bales]] seems to date back to the early 20th century in the midwestern United States, particularly the sand-hills of [[Nebraska]], where grass was plentiful and other building materials (even quality [[sod]]s) were not. Straw bale building typically consists of stacking a series of rows of bales (often in running-bond) on a raised footing or [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]], with a moisture barrier between. Bale walls are often tied together with pins of bamboo or wood (internal to the bales or on their faces), or with surface wire meshes, and then [[stucco]]ed or [[plaster]]ed using either lime-based formulations or earth/clay renders.  Bale buildings can either have a structural frame of other materials, with bales between (simply serving as insulation and stucco substrate), referred to as "infill", or the bales may actually provide the support for openings and roof, referred to as "[[load-bearing]]" or "Nebraska-style", or a combination of [[framing (construction)|framing]] and load-bearing may be employed, referred to a "hybrid" straw bale.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Typically, bales created on farms with mobile machinery have been used ("field-bales"), but recently higher-density "recompressed" bales (or "straw-blocks") are increasing the loads that may be supported; where field bales might support around 600 pounds per linear foot of wall, the high density bales bear up to 4,000&amp;nbsp;lb./lin.ft.

===Timber frame===
{{Main|Timber frame}}
[[Image:timber frame.jpg|thumb|right|The completed frame of a modern timber frame home]]

The basic elements of timber frame building&amp;mdash;joined timbers, clay walls and [[Thatched roof|thatch roofs]] were in place in Europe and Asia by the 9th century. It remained the common mode of house construction in northern cultures until the 19th century.  Craftsmanship was, and is, an important value in timber frame building.  The oldest timber frame structures (for example, the timber framed stave churches of [[Scandinavia]]) show both craftsmanship and a strong grasp of the technical aspects of structural design, as do such structures in [[Japan]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Timber framing typically uses a "[[Bent (structural)|bent]]."  A bent is a structural support, like a [[truss]], consisting of two posts, a tie beam and two rafters. These are connected into a framework through joinery. To practice the craft, one must understand the basic structural aspects of the bent.  This, along with a knowledge of [[joiner]]y, are the basis of timber frame building.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Timber framing is now a modern method of construction, Ideally suited to mass house building as well as public buildings. In conjunction with a number of natural insulations and timber cladding or modern [[lime render]]s, it is possible to quickly construct a high performance, sustainable building, using completely natural products. The benefits are many&amp;mdash;the building performs better over its lifespan, waste is reduced (much can be re-cycled, composted or used as fuel). Timber frame structures are frequently used in combination with other natural building techniques, such as cob, straw bale, or cordwood/masonry.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

[[Image:Cupandring.JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;A replica of an unusual cup-and-ring-marked stone from [[Museum of Ayrshire Country Life and Costume|Dalgarven]], North Ayrshire, Scotland.]]
In the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] [[British Isles]], [[rock art]] was produced across various parts of the islands. [[Petroglyph]]ic in nature, the majority of such carvings are [[Abstraction|abstract]] in design, usually [[cup and ring mark]]s, although examples of spirals or figurative depictions of weaponry are also known. Only one form of [[rock art in Europe]], this late prehistoric tradition had connections with others along [[Atlantic Europe]], particularly in Galicia.

The study of rock art in the British Isles was largely initiated by amateur researchers rather than academic or other professional [[archaeology|archaeologists]].

Surviving examples of rock art in the British Isles are believed to represent only a small sample of that which had been produced in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Many examples of petroglyphs would have eroded away, thereby being lost to contemporary scholarship.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=5}} In other examples, images might have been painted onto rock, or marked onto less permanent surfaces, such as wood, livestock or the human body, thereby also failing to survive into the present.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=5}}

==Chronology==
Rock art had first appeared in Atlantic Europe by the late fourth millennium BCE.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=65}}
In Britain, rock art had ceased by the time of the agricultural intensification in the Late Bronze Age, the first millennium BCE.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=65}}

==Distribution==
===Northern Britain===
Within Britain, the majority of recorded Neolithic and Bronze Age rock art comes from the northern part of the island.{{sfn|Evans|2004|p=14}}{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=175}} Cup-and-ring marks are particularly common in this area.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=33}}

Cup-and-ring marks are usually attributed to the Neolithic and Early Bronze Ages,{{sfn|Beckensall|1999|p=23}} while attempts at building a relative chronology have been tried in [[Dumbartonshire]].{{sfn|Mackie|Davis|1989}}

===South West Britain===
Over 70 examples of late prehistoric rock art have been identified in the [[South West England|South West of Britain]],{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=175}} being far sparser than those found in the North.{{sfn|Beckensall|1999|p=83}} This may in part be due to the harder nature of the natural rock in the area, which is largely plutonic granite, alongside a lack of research focused in this region.{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=175}} Rock art specialist George Nash considered the petroglyphs of this region to constitute a distinct artistic tradition from that in the North.{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=175}}
The majority of petroglyphs in South West Britain are cup marks, engraved both onto the rock face and on boulders, as at the Castallack Menhir.{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=176}}

[[File:Rockyvalleycarving2.JPG|thumb|left|One of the Rocky Valley labyrinths.]]

Archaeologists are aware of three instances in South West Britain where weapons are depicted in petroglyphs: at [[Boscawen-un]] stone circle in [[Cornwall]], at [[Badbury Rings]] Barrow in [[Devon]], and at [[Stonehenge]] in [[Wiltshire]].{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=183}} Using relative dating, the weapons depicted on Boscawen-un have been tentatively dated to ''circa'' 2000 BCE, while those at Badbury Rings and Stonehenge have been dated to ''c''. 1800 BCE.{{sfn|Nash|2007|pp=183&amp;ndash;184}}

Several petroglyphic [[labyrinth]]s have also been discovered in South West Britain. The best known of these are a neighbouring pair that have been found engraved onto a [[shale]] outcrop at [[Rocky Valley]], Cornwall.{{sfn|Nash|2007|pp=186&amp;ndash;187}} Apparently incised using a metal implement, Nash suggested that the southern labyrinth had previously been engraved using a stone tool.{{sfn|Nash|2007|pp=186&amp;ndash;187}} Publicly revealed in 1948,{{sfn|Saward|2001}} it has been suggested that they are Bronze Age in date, due to similarities with Bronze Age petroglyphs in Galicia and [[Valcamonica]].{{sfn|Nash|2007|p=186}} Conversely, many rock art researchers do not consider them to be prehistoric, with Saward arguing that they were created between the 16th and 18th-centuries, when the neighbouring Trewethett Mill was operational. As evidence, she noted that labyrinths were a popular motif in folk customs at the time, and that the good state of preservation would not be present if they had prehistoric origins.{{sfn|Saward|2001}}

===Ireland===
[[File:Newgrange, Ireland.jpg|thumb|right|Engravings at the entrance to [[Newgrange]].]]
Cup-and-ring marks are particularly common in this area.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=33}}

Petroglyphs can be found carved onto Early Neolithic passage tombs, such as [[Newgrange]].

==Research==
Throughout the British Isles, most of the research into rock art has been undertaken by amateurs rather than professional archaeologists, to varying degrees of quality.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=7}}

In 1997, archaeologist [[Richard Bradley (archaeologist)|Richard Bradley]] of the [[University of Reading]] published ''[[Rock Art and the Prehistory of Atlantic Europe]]'', the first study of such petroglyphs across Atlantic Europe.{{sfn|Bradley|1997}} In 1999, Stan Beckensall published ''British Prehistoric Rock Art'', the first regional overview of the island's rock art.{{sfn|Beckensall|1999}}

==Purpose==
The purposes of Neolithic and Bronze Age petroglyphs in the British Isles have long been debated, with amateur rock art researcher Ronald Morris listing 104 different proposals that he had encountered, ranking them according to what he believed to be their plausibility.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|pp=3&amp;ndash;4}}{{sfn|Beckensall|1999|p=8}}
It has been noted that the meanings and usage of such rock art might have changed over time, as they came to be encountered by communities unaware of their original purpose.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=55}}

===Directional signs===
Smith and Walker suggested that British cupmarks may have acted as directional signs, being placed alongside pathways to guide those travelling along them.{{sfn|Smith|Walker|2011|p=21}}

===Entoptic phenomenon and altered states of consciousness===
One suggestion is that the motifs found in the rock art of the British Isles are depictions of [[phosphene]]s, [[entoptic phenomenon]] produced through the disturbance of the [[optic nerve]] that result from [[altered states of consciousness]].{{sfn|Bradley|1997|pp=51&amp;ndash;54}} Such altered states might have been induced by the use of [[hallucinogens|hallucinogenic drugs]], evidence for which exists from Neolithic and Bronze Age Europe.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=54}}

This idea was first applied to the petroglyphs on the Neolithic monuments of the British Isles by [[David Lewis-Williams]] and T. Dowson. They noted that the depiction of phosphenes could appear independently in different areas due their common basis in the human nervous system.{{sfn|Lewis-Williams|Dowson|1993|pp=61&amp;ndash;62}} Lewis-Williams and David Pearce expanded on this idea in their book ''[[Inside the Neolithic Mind]]''.
Bradley extended these ideas to suggest that the circular designs on open air petroglyphs might have represented a pathway that led into the rock.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=54}}

Dronfield defended the entoptic explanation by way of ethnographic comparison. Examining art produced by a society that placed great emphasis on altered states of consciousness with another that did not, he highlighted that the former contained motifs identified as phosphenes while the latter did not.{{sfn|Dronfield|1995}} Although believing that it represents "a helpful clue to the roots of Atlantic rock art", Bradley noted that even if the earliest instances of rock art were based upon entoptic phenomenon, they may have become divorced from their original inspiration as they were more copied elsewhere.{{sfn|Bradley|1997|p=54}}

===Water symbolism===
Smith and Walker also suggested that cup-and-ring marks were symbolically linked to water, having sacred associations in late prehistoric society. As evidence, they noted that a number of the larger cups, which they refer to as basins, would have collected rain water.{{sfn|Smith|Walker|2011|p=23}} They believed that cup-and-ring markings looked like the ripples produced when raindrops hit water.{{sfn|Smith|Walker|2011|p=29}}

Meryman et al. independently reported in the same year that toxic effects of methanol, ethanol, and ammonium acetate in the frozen state are also detectable in thawed erythrocytes [46]. These non-nucleated cells did not show injury attributable to glycerol or Me2SO in the latter experiments, but evidence continued to emerge in support of putatively toxic effects of cryoprotectants during freezing [2,10,12,14,28], including such effects even in glycerolized erythrocytes [47,50,53], and by 1986 the overall evidence had become quite strong [17].}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the cost of [[Cryoprotectant#Toxicity|cryoprotectant toxicity]] and side effects of [[Desiccation|dehydration]] of tissue due to the [[blood–brain barrier]].&lt;ref&gt;

Neuropreservation has several advantages over whole body preservation. It costs less; neuropatients are easier to transport in case of legal, social, or physical problems; it is possible to do a better job of perfusing and therefore cryoprotecting the brain when there is no need to consider other tissues, and its smaller volume allows more rapid and less expensive cooling.&lt;ref name="neuropreservation option" /&gt; [[Aubrey de Grey]] has theorized that neuropatients will be revived after procedures have been perfected on whole body patients, and, therefore, have better chances for revival.&lt;ref name="daily mail"&gt;{{cite news

==History==
Neuropreservation was first proposed in 1965 by cryonics co-creator Evan Cooper, proposed again in a speculative scientific paper by [[Gerontology|gerontologist]] George M. Martin in 1971, and independently proposed yet again in 1974 by [[Mike Darwin]], and [[Fred and Linda Chamberlain]].  The Chamberlains were the founders of the [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation]].  In 1976 Fred’s father became the first of many neuropreservation patients at Alcor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Chamberlain | first=Fred &amp; Linda | title=FRC Jr. |  publisher=Lifepact   | date=July 16, 2006 | url=http://www.lifepact.com/frcjr.htm  | access-date=2008-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the year 2000, neuropreservation was performed by surgical separation of the body from the head (called [[Head|cephalic]] isolation or "neuroseparation") at the end of [[cryoprotectant]] [[perfusion]] performed on the upper body via the ascending [[aorta]].&lt;ref name="neuropreservation option" /&gt;  After that year, Alcor began performing cephalic isolation before cryoprotectant perfusion, in deep [[hypothermia]], and then using the carotid and vetebral arteries directly for perfusion with cryoprotectants.

{{As of|2014}}, Alcor, Oregon Cryonics, and [[KrioRus]] are the only cryonics organizations that offer neuropreservation. Other organizations, such as the other major provider, [[Cryonics Institute]], avoid it because they are concerned about neuropreservation's negative effect on the public’s perception of cryonics and, especially, because of the adverse effect on the families of patients. Journalists and horror novelists invariably have a field day with "frozen severed heads", and focus not on the scientific or humanitarian purposes of cryonics, but on sensationalizing cryonics as grotesque or ridiculous. Their policy to always preserve the entire body prevents anyone leveling those claims at Cryonics Institute. Their goal is to preserve and eventually revive people, so they avoid processes like neurocryopreservation that could damage or otherwise put their patients at risk. Alcor claims there are good technical justifications for neuropreservation, and that they will continue to offer it.  Approximately three-quarters of the cryonics patients stored at Alcor are neuropatients.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10678">'''Phenomenology''' in architecture can be understood as an aspect of [[philosophy]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; researching into the experience of built space, and as shorthand for [[architectural phenomenology]], a historical architectural movement.

==Overview==
The phenomenology of architecture is the philosophical study of architecture as it appears in experience. In contrast, architectural phenomenology is a movement within architecture beginning in the 1950s, reaching its apogee in the late 1970s and 1980s, and continuing until today, which is both intellectual and an aesthetic in character. Architectural phenomenology, with its emphasis on architecture as a human experience that is historically contingent, stood in sharp contrast to the anti-historicism of postwar modernism. As a movement, it helped give new legitimacy to idea that historical buildings contained valuable experiential lessons for contemporary designers. The emphasis on history was a challenge to postwar [[modern architecture]] which eventually led to [[Postmodern architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Otero-Pailos  | first =Jorge  | title =Architecture’s Historical Turn: Phenomenology and the Rise of the Postmodern  | publisher =University of Minnesota Press| year =2010 | location = | pages =  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=3WDOQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=architecture's%20historical%20turn&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions  | isbn=9780816666041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==
American architects first started seriously studying phenomenology at Princeton University in the 1950s under Prof. [[Jean Labatut]], whose student [[Charles W. Moore]] was the first to write a PhD dissertation, titled Water and Architecture (1958), that drew heavily on the philosophy of [[Gaston Bachelard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Otero-Pailos  | first =Jorge  | title =Architecture’s Historical Turn: Phenomenology and the Rise of the Postmodern  | publisher =University of Minnesota Press| year =2010 | location = | pages =102  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=3WDOQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=architecture's%20historical%20turn&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions  | isbn=9780816666041}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, Milanese architect [[Ernesto Nathan Rogers]], through his influential editorship of the journal Casabella Continuità helped to advance architectural phenomenology in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Otero-Pailos, Theorizing the Anti-Avant-Garde: Invocations of Phenomenology in Architectural Discourse, 1945-1989, (Ph.D. Dissertation: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; He collaborated with philosopher [[Enzo Paci]], and influenced a generation of young architects including [[Vittorio Gregotti]] and [[Aldo Rossi]].&lt;ref&gt;Vittorio Gregotti and Jorge Otero-Pailos, "Interview with Vittorio Gregotti: The Role of Phenomenology in the Formation of the Italian Neo-Avant-Garde," in Thresholds, n. 21 (Fall 2000), 40-46&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, the Norwegian architect, theorist and historian [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]] achieved international acclaim with his book "Genius Loci: Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture" (1979), which was markedly influenced by [[Martin Heidegger]]'s hermeneutic ontology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Jarzombek]]—''The Psychologizing of Modernity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;He also wrote ''Intentions in Architecture'' (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, Martin Heidegger's essay "Building Dwelling Thinking", 1951&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]] was, for many architecture students of the 1980s, an important reference in architectural phenomenology,&lt;ref&gt;A Norwegian, he graduated from the Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule ([[ETH]]) in Zurich in 1949 and eventually became Dean of the Oslo School of Architecture.&lt;/ref&gt; especially because the combination of texts and images in his books provided readily accessible explanations for how a phenomenological approach to architecture could be translated into designs. Norberg-Schulz spawned a wide following, including his successor at the Oslo School of Architecture, [[Thomas Thiis-Evensen]].&lt;ref&gt;see Thomas Thiis-Evensen, ''Archetypes in Architecture'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, the School of Comparative Studies at the [[University of Essex]], under the influence of [[Dalibor Vesely]] and [[Joseph Rykwert]], was the breeding ground for a generation of architectural phenomenologists, which included [[David Leatherbarrow]], professor of architecture at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Alberto Pérez-Gómez]], professor of architectural history at [[McGill University]], and the architect [[Daniel Libeskind]]. In the 1980s, the phenomenological approach to architecture was continued and further developed by Vesely and his colleague [[Peter Carl]] in their research and teaching at the Department of Architecture at the [[University of Cambridge]]. As architectural phenomenology became established in academia, professors developed theory seminars that tried to expand the movement's range of ideas beyond [[Gaston Bachelard]],&lt;ref&gt;Gaston Bachelard ''[[The Poetics of Space]]'' (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin Heidegger]], to include [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]],&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Merleau-Ponty's ''Phenomenology of Perception'' (English version 1962)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] [[Hannah Arendt]] and an ever wider group of theorists whose modes of thinking bordered on phenomenology, such as [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Henri Bergson]], and [[Paul Virilio]] (urban planner).

'''Dwelling'''

The phenomenon of dwelling was a central research theme in architectural phenomenology. Much of the way it was understood in architecture was shaped by the later thought of [[Martin Heidegger]] as set in his influential essay: "Building Dwelling Thinking." He links dwelling to what he refers as the "gathering of the fourfold," namely the regions of being as entailed by the phenomena of: "the saving of earth, the reception of sky (heavens), the initiation of mortals into their death, and the awaiting/remembering of divinities." The essence of dwelling is not architectural, per se, in the same manner that the essence of technology for him is not technological per se.&lt;ref&gt;*[[Nader El-Bizri]], "Being at Home Among Things: Heidegger's Reflections on Dwelling", ''Environment, Space, Place'' Vol. 3 (2011)pp.&amp;nbsp;47–71; and [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural Phenomenology', ''Studia UBB Philosophia'' 60 (2015)pp.&amp;nbsp;5–30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence in practice==
Prominent architects, such as [[Daniel Libeskind]] [[Steven Holl]] and [[Peter Zumthor]] are described by [[Juhani Pallasmaa]] as current practitioners of the phenomenology of architecture. In more recent years the phenomenological orientation in architectural thinking has been reinforced through the research of a new generation of younger architectural phenomenologist, such as the philosopher-architect [[Nader El-Bizri]], who is a Heideggerian scholar with extensive works in phenomenology and commentaries on [[Khôra]], and a metaphysician in his own right, or via the practice of the academic-architect Adam Sharr in Britain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3877">In [[computability theory]], the theory of '''real computation''' deals with hypothetical computing machines using infinite-precision [[real number]]s. They are given this name because they operate on the set of [[real number]]s. Within this theory, it is possible to prove interesting statements such as "The complement of the [[Mandelbrot set]] is only partially decidable."

These hypothetical computing machines can be viewed as idealised [[analog computer]]s which operate on real numbers, whereas [[digital computer]]s are limited to [[computable numbers]]. They may be further subdivided into [[differential (mathematics)|differential]] and [[algebra]]ic models (digital computers, in this context, should be thought of as [[topology|topological]], at least insofar as their operation on [[computable real]]s is concerned&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Simple Introduction to Computable Analysis|author=Klaus Weihrauch|year=1995|url=http://eccc.uni-trier.de/static/books/A_Simple_Introduction_to_Computable_Analysis_Fragments_of_a_Book/}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Depending on the model chosen, this may enable real computers to solve problems that are inextricable on digital computers (For example, [[Hava Siegelmann]]'s [[neural nets]] can have noncomputable real weights, making them able to compute nonrecursive languages.) or vice versa. ([[Claude Shannon]]'s idealized analog computer can only solve algebraic differential equations, while a digital computer can solve some transcendental equations as well. However this comparison is not entirely fair since in [[Claude Shannon]]'s idealized analog computer computations are immediately done; i.e. computation is done in real time. Shannon's model can be adapted to cope with this problem.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=O. Bournez |author2=M. L. Campagnolo |author3=D. S. Graça |author4=E.

A canonical model of computation over the reals is [[Blum–Shub–Smale machine]] (BSS).

If real computation were physically realizable, one could use it to solve [[NP-complete]] problems, and even [[Sharp P|#P]]-complete problems, in [[polynomial time]]. Unlimited precision real numbers in the physical universe are prohibited by the [[holographic principle]] and the [[Bekenstein bound]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Aaronson]], ''[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502072 NP-complete Problems and Physical Reality]'', ACM [[SIGACT]] News, Vol. 36, No. 1.

A '''risk management plan''' is a document that a [[project manager]] prepares to foresee risks, estimate impacts, and define responses to issues. It also contains a [[Risk matrix|risk assessment matrix]].

A risk is "an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project's objectives."&lt;ref&gt;[[Project Management Body of Knowledge|PMBOK]] Guide 5th Edition, Glossary pg. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; Risk is inherent with any [[project]], and [[project manager]]s should assess risks continually and develop plans to address them.  The risk management plan contains an analysis of likely risks with both high and low impact, as well as mitigation strategies to help the project avoid being derailed should common problems arise.  Risk management plans should be periodically reviewed by the project team to avoid having the analysis become stale and not reflective of actual potential project risks.

Most critically, [[risk management]] plans include a risk strategy.  

==Risk response==
{{main |Risk management#Potential risk treatments}}
Broadly, there are four potential responses to risk with numerous variations on the specific terms used to name these response options:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Special Publication 800-37 RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND ORGANIZATIONS |date=May 2018 |edition=revision 2 draft |publisher=National Institute of Science and Technology |url= https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/rev-2/draft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |title=CRISC Review Manual
 |date=2015
 |edition=6th
 |publisher=ISACA
 |isbn=978-1-60420-371-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid – Change plans to circumvent the problem;
* Control / mitigate / modify / reduce – Reduce threat impact or likelihood (or both) through intermediate steps;
* Accept / retain – Assume the chance of the negative impact (or ''auto-insurance''), eventually ''budget'' the cost (e.g. via a contingency budget line); or 
* Transfer / share – Outsource risk (or a portion of the risk) to a third party or parties that can manage the outcome. This is done financially through insurance contracts or hedging transactions, or operationally through outsourcing an activity.

(Mnemonic: SARA, for '''S'''hare '''A'''void '''R'''educe '''A'''ccept, or A-CAT, for "Avoid, Control, Accept, or Transfer")

Risk management plans often include matrices.

==Examples==
The United States Department of Defense, as part of acquisition, uses risk management planning that may have a Risk Management Plan document for the specific project.  The general intent of the RMP in this context is to define the scope of risks to be tracked and means of documenting reports.  It is also desired that there would be an integrated relationship to other processes.  An example of this would be explaining which developmental tests verify risks of the design type were minimized are stated as part of the [[test and evaluation master plan]].  A further example would be instructions from 5000.2D&lt;ref&gt;[https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=44705&amp;lang=en-US SECNAVINST 5000.2D 3.4.4.1]&lt;/ref&gt; that for programs that are part of a [[system of systems]] the risk management strategy shall specifically address integration and interoperability as a risk area.  The RMP specific process and templates shift over time (e.g. the disappearance of 2002 documents Defense Finance and Accounting Service / System Risk Management Plan, and the SPAWAR Risk Management Process).

== Reception ==
During a preview, [[GroenLinks]] leader [[Jesse Klaver]] said: 'I'm really looking forward to this series. I think this is the best way to show how your personal behaviour has an effect on such a large phenomenon as the environment.'&lt;ref name="RTL"/&gt;

''[[Trouw]]'' reviewer Renate van der Bas wrote that viewers of the programme 'learn a lot', and characterised it as 'a fitting call' for more sustainability. However, the title chosen for the show, ''Rot op met je milieu'', was 'not very subtle', and the selection of participants 'rather over the top'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.trouw.nl/home/van-pannetjes-vette-soep-tot-containerschepen~a37b9272/ |title=Van pannetjes vette soep tot containerschepen |author=Renate van der Bas |work=Trouw |date=14 October 2016 |accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Beerekamp of ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'' opined that the show was 'somewhat less predictable' than your average reality show, 'but most of it is still the result of editorial manipulation'. Beerekamp mostly criticised the fact that the two participants Donny and Roxanne, who he said represented the 'super-spoilt generation', didn't seem to realise how they contributed to the current environmental problems through their own behaviour.&lt;ref name="Beerekamp"/&gt;

      <comment>No, it's not from the Bible Belt. It's a solid source reporting on facts. See [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine#Sex determination material at the Sexual differentiation in humans article]]. But I can easily add a different source. Fixing "assignment" for "gonads," which I found odd and POV as well.</comment>

'''Sexual differentiation in humans''' is the process of development of [[sex differences in humans]]. It is defined as the development of [[phenotype|phenotypic]] structures consequent to the action of hormones produced following gonadal determination.&lt;ref name="endo.endojournals.org"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/142/8/3281/2988779/Minireview-Sex-Differentiation|title=Minireview: Sex Differentiation|first=Ieuan A.|last=Hughes|date=1 August 2001|journal=Endocrinology|volume=142|issue=8|pages=3281–3287|accessdate=2 October 2017|via=endo.endojournals.org|doi=10.1210/endo.142.8.8406}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual differentiation]] includes development of different genitalia and the internal genital tracts, breasts, body hair, and plays a role in gender identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gfmer.ch/Books/Reproductive_health/Human_sexual_differentiation.html|title=Human sexual differentiation|website=Gfmer.ch|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of sexual differences begins with the [[XY sex-determination system]] that is present in humans, and complex mechanisms are responsible for the development of the phenotypic differences between [[male]] and [[female]] [[human]]s from an undifferentiated [[zygote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01726695 |title=Determination of sex chromosomal constitution and chromosomal origin of drumsticks, drumstick-like structures, and other nuclear bodies in human blood cells at interphase by fluorescence in situ hybridization |year=1990 |last1=Mukherjee |first1=Asit B. |last2=Parsa |first2=Nasser Z. |journal=Chromosoma |volume=99 |issue=6 |pages=432–5 |pmid=2176962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females have two [[X chromosome]]s, and males have a [[Y chromosome]] and an X chromosome. At an early stage in [[embryo]]nic development, both sexes possess equivalent internal structures. These are the [[mesonephric duct]]s and [[paramesonephric duct]]s. The presence of the [[SRY gene]] on the Y chromosome causes the development of the testes in males, and the subsequent release of hormones which cause the [[paramesonephric duct]]s to regress. In females, the mesonephric ducts regress.

Divergent sexual development, known as [[intersex]], can be a result of genetic and hormonal factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16160410 |year=2005 |last1=Kučinskas |first1=Laimutis |last2=Just |first2=Walter |title=Human male sex determination and sexual differentiation: Pathways, molecular interactions and genetic disorders |volume=41 |issue=8 |pages=633–40 |journal=Medicina |url=http://medicina.kmu.lt/0508/0508-01e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex determination==
{{Main article|XY sex-determination system}}
Most [[mammal]]s, including humans, have an [[XY sex-determination system]]: the [[Y chromosome]] carries factors responsible for triggering male development. The "default sex," in the absence of a Y chromosome, is female-like. This is because of the presence of the sex-determining region of the Y chromosome, also known as the [[SRY]] gene.&lt;ref name="endotext.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.endotext.org/pediatrics/pediatrics7/pediatrics7.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614065522/http://www.endotext.org/pediatrics/pediatrics7/pediatrics7.html |archivedate=2012-06-14 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Thus, male mammals typically have an X and a Y chromosome (XY), while female mammals typically have two [[X chromosome]]s (XX). In humans, biological sex is determined by five factors present at birth: the presence or absence of a Y chromosome, the type of [[gonad]]s, the [[sex hormone]]s, the internal genitalia (such as the [[uterus]] in females), and the external genitalia.&lt;ref name="KnoxSchacht2011"&gt;Knox, David; Schacht, Caroline. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=iVOXAp27iQkC&amp;pg=PT64 Choices in Relationships: An Introduction to Marriage and the Family]''. 11 ed. Cengage Learning; 10 October 2011 [cited 17 June 2013]. {{ISBN|9781111833220}}. p. 64–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromosomal sex is determined at the time of [[fertilization]]; a [[chromosome]] from the [[sperm]] cell, either X or Y, fuses with the X chromosome in the egg cell. ''Gonadal sex'' refers to the gonads, that is the testis or ovaries, depending on which genes are expressed. ''Phenotypic sex'' refers to the structures of the external and internal genitalia.{{sfn|Acherman|Jameson|2012|p=3046-48}} 

A human [[fetus]] does not develop its external sexual organs until seven weeks after fertilization. The fetus appears to be sexually indifferent, looking neither like a male or a female. Over the next five weeks, the fetus begins producing hormones that cause its sex organs to grow into either male or female organs. This process is called sexual differentiation. The precursor of the internal female sex organs is called the [[Müllerian system]].

==Reproductive system==
{{Main article|Development of the reproductive system}}
[[File:SRY Gene Pathway.jpg|right|400px|Figure One: The mesonephric System Pathway &lt;ref&gt;Silverthorn, Dee, U.. (2010). Reproduction and Development. In: Human Physiology: an integrated approach. 5th ed. san francisco: Pearson education. p828-831.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
By 7 weeks, a fetus has a [[genital tubercle]], urogenital groove and sinus, and [[labioscrotal folds]]. In females, without excess androgens, these become the [[clitoris]], [[urethra]] and [[vagina]], and [[labia (genitalia)|labia]]

Differentiation between the sexes of the sex organs occurs throughout embryological, fetal and later life. This includes both internal and external genital differentiation. In both males and females, the sex organs consist of three structures: the [[gonads]], the internal genitalia, and the external genitalia.  In males, the gonads are the [[testes]] and in females they are the [[ovaries]].  These are the organs that produce [[gametes]] (egg and sperm), the reproductive cells that will eventually meet to form the fertilized egg ([[zygote]]).

As the zygote divides, it first becomes the [[embryo]] (which means 'growing within'), typically between zero and eight weeks, then from the eighth week until birth, it is considered the fetus (which means 'unborn offspring').   The internal genitalia are all the accessory glands and ducts that connect the gonads to the outside environment.  The external genitalia consist of all the external reproductive structures. The sex of an early embryo cannot be determined because the reproductive structures do not differentiate until the seventh week.  Prior to this, the child is considered bipotential because it cannot be identified as male or female.

===Internal genital differentiation===
The internal genitalia consist of two accessory ducts: [[mesonephric duct]]s (male) and [[paramesonephric duct]]s (female). The mesonephric system is the precursor to the male genitalia and the paramesonephric  to the female reproductive system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albany.edu/faculty/cafrye/apsy601/Ch.09Sex.html|title=Learning Objectives|website=Albany.edu|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As development proceeds, one of the pairs of ducts develops while the other regresses.  This depends on the presence or absence of the sex determining region of the Y chromosome, also known as the SRY [[gene]].&lt;ref name="endotext.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.endotext.org/pediatrics/pediatrics7/pediatrics7.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614065522/http://www.endotext.org/pediatrics/pediatrics7/pediatrics7.html |archivedate=2012-06-14 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;  In the presence of a functional SRY gene, the bipotential gonads develop into testes. [[Gonad]]s are histologically distinguishable by 6–8 weeks of gestation.

Subsequent development of one set and degeneration of the other depends on the presence or absence of two testicular hormones: [[testosterone]] and [[anti-müllerian hormone|anti-müllerian hormone (AMH)]].  Disruption of typical development may result in the development of both, or neither, duct system, which may produce morphologically [[intersex]] individuals.

'''Males:''' The SRY gene when transcribed and processed produces SRY protein that binds to DNA and directs the development of the gonad into testes.   Male development can only occur when the fetal testis secretes key hormones at a critical period in early gestation. The testes begin to secrete three hormones that influence the male internal and external genitalia: they secrete anti-müllerian hormone (AMH),  [[testosterone]], and [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT). Anti-müllerian hormone causes the paramesonephric ducts to regress.  Testosterone converts the mesonephric ducts into male accessory structures, including the [[epididymis]], [[vas deferens]], and seminal vesicle.   Testosterone will also control the descending of the testes from the abdomen into the [[scrotum]].&lt;ref name="endo.endojournals.org"/&gt; Many other genes found on other [[autosomes]], including''WT-1'', ''SOX9'', ''SF-1'' also play a role in gonadal development.&lt;ref name="HARRISONS2008"&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Anthony S. |editor-last=Fauci |editor-first2=T. R. |editor-last2=Harrison|title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine|date=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-147693-5|pages=2339–2346|edition=17th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Females:''' Without testosterone and AMH, the mesonephric ducts degenerate and disappear. The paramesonephric ducts develop into a [[uterus]], [[fallopian tube]]s, and upper [[vagina]].&lt;ref name=HARRISONS2008 /&gt; There still remains a broad lack of information about the genetic controls of female development, and much remains unknown about the female embryonic process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne (1992). Myths of Gender, Revised Edition. Perseus Books (HarperCollins), 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===External genital differentiation===
[[File:Human anatomy.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of an adult female human and an adult male. Note that both models have partially shaved body hair.]]

Males become externally distinct between 8 and 12 weeks, as androgens enlarge the phallus and cause the urogenital groove and sinus to fuse in the midline, producing an unambiguous [[penis]] with a phallic urethra, and a thinned, rugated [[scrotum]]. 
Dihydrotestosterone will differentiate the remaining male characteristics of  the external genitalia.&lt;ref name="endo.endojournals.org"/&gt;

A sufficient amount of any androgen can cause external [[virilization|masculinization]]. The most potent is [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT), generated from testosterone in skin and genital tissue by the action of 5α-reductase. A male fetus may be incompletely masculinized if this enzyme is [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency|deficient]]. In some [[disease]]s and circumstances, other androgens may be present in high enough concentrations to cause partial or (rarely) complete masculinization of the external genitalia of a genetically female fetus. The testes begin to secrete three hormones that influence the male internal and external genitalia.  They secrete anti-müllerian hormone, testosterone, and Dihydrotestosterone.  anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) causes the paramesonephric ducts to regress.  Testosterone, which is secreted and converts the mesonephric ducts into male accessory structures, such as epididymis, vas deferens and seminal vesicle.   Testosterone will also control the descending of the testes from the abdomen into the scrotom.  Dihydrotestosterone, also known as (DHT) will differentiate the remaining male characteristics of  the external genitalia.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Ieuan A. . (June 12, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Further sex differentiation of the external genitalia occurs at [[puberty]], when androgen levels again become disparate. Male levels of testosterone directly induce growth of the penis, and indirectly (via DHT) the [[prostate]].

[[Alfred Jost]] observed that while testosterone was required for mesonephric duct development, the regression of the [[paramesonephric duct]] was due to another substance. This was later determined to be paramesonephric inhibiting substance (MIS), a 140 kD dimeric glycoprotein that is produced by [[sertoli cells]]. MIS blocks the development of [[paramesonephric ducts]], promoting their regression.&lt;ref name="Jost"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.1970.0052 |jstor=2417046 |title=Hormonal Factors in the Sex Differentiation of the Mammalian Foetus &amp;#91;and Discussion&amp;#93; |year=1970 |last1=Jost |first1=A. |last2=Price |first2=D. |last3=Edwards |first3=R. G. |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=259 |issue=828 |pages=119–31|bibcode=1970RSPTB.259..119J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary sexual characteristics==

===Breast===
Visible differentiation occurs at [[puberty]], when [[estradiol]] and other hormones cause [[breast]]s to develop in typical females.

==Psychological and behavioral differentiation==


Human adults and children show many psychological and behavioral sex differences. Some (e.g., dress) are learned and obviously cultural. Others are demonstrable across cultures and have both biological and learned determinants. For example, some studies claim girls are, on average, more verbally fluent than boys, but boys are, on average, better at spatial calculation.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, Diane F. (2011). Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities: 4th Edition.  NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geary, David C. (2009).  Male, Female: The Evolution of Human Sex Differences (2nd Ed.) Washington, D.C.: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have observed that this may be due to two different patterns in parental communication with infants, noting that parents are more likely to talk to girls and more likely to engage in physical play with boys.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because people cannot explore hormonal influences on human behavior experimentally, the [[Nature versus nurture|relative contributions]] of biological factors and learning to human psychological and behavioral sex differences (especially gender identity, role, and [[sexual orientation]]) are controversial (and hotly contested).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/733913684|title=Brain storm : the flaws in the science of sex differences|last=1963-|first=Jordan-Young, Rebecca M.,|isbn=9780674063518|edition=First Harvard University Press paperback|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=733913684}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/707442506|title=Delusions of Gender : The Real Science Behind Sex Differences|last=Cordelia.|first=Fine, |authorlink=Cordelia Fine|date=2011|publisher=Icon Books|isbn=9781848312203|location=London|oclc=707442506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current theories on mechanisms of sexual differentiation of brains and behavior in humans are based primarily on three sources of evidence: animal research involving manipulation of hormones in early life, observation of outcomes of small numbers of individuals with [[intersex]] conditions or cases of early [[sex reassignment therapy|sex reassignment]], and statistical distribution of traits in populations (e.g., rates of homosexuality in twins). Many of these cases suggest some genetic or hormonal effect on sex differentiation of behavior and mental traits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Steven Pinker |last=Pinker |first=Steven |title=[[The Blank Slate]] |location=New York |publisher=Penguin |year=2002 |isbn= |pages=346–350 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; this has been disputed as poor interpretation of scientific methodology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Intersex conditions==
{{Main article|Intersex}}
The following are some of the variations associated with atypical determination and differentiation process:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMra022784 |title=Sex Determination and Differentiation |year=2004 |last1=MacLaughlin |first1=David T. |last2=Donahoe |first2=Patricia K. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=350 |issue=4 |pages=367–78 |pmid=14736929}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A zygote with only X chromosome (XO) results in [[Turner syndrome]] and will develop with female characteristics.&lt;ref name="endotext.org"/&gt;
*[[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] - Inability of adrenal to produce sufficient [[cortisol]], leading to increased production of testosterone resulting in severe masculinization of 46 XX females.
*[[Persistent müllerian duct syndrome]] - A rare type of [[pseudohermaphroditism]] that occurs in 46 XY males, caused by either a mutation in the Müllerian inhibiting substance (MIS) gene, on 19p13, or its type II receptor, 12q13. Results in a retention of Müllerian ducts (persistence of rudimentary uterus and fallopian tubes in otherwise normally virilized males), unilateral or bilateral undescended testes and sometimes causes infertility.
*XY differences of sex development - Atypical androgen production or inadequate androgen response, which can cause incomplete masculinization in XY males. Varies from mild failure of masculinization with undescended testes to complete sex reversal and female phenotype ([[Androgen insensitivity syndrome]])
*[[Swyer syndrome]]. A form of complete gonadal dysgenesis, mostly due to mutations in the first step of sex determination; the [[SRY]] genes.
* A [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency]] results in atypical development characterized by female phenotype or undervirilized male phenotype with development of the [[epididymis]], [[vas deferens]], [[seminal vesicle]], and [[ejaculatory duct]], but also a [[Androgen insensitivity syndrome#Neonatal manifestations|pseudovagina]]. This is because testosterone is converted to the more potent [[Dihydrotestosterone|DHT]] by 5-alpha reductase. DHT is necessary to exert [[androgenic]] effects farther from the site of testosterone production, where the concentrations of testosterone are too low to have any potency.

Stream '''substrate''' ([[sediment]]) is the material that rests at the bottom of a [[stream]]. There are several classification guides. One is:

*[[Mud]] – silt and clay.
*[[Sand]] – Particles between 0.06 and 2&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.
*[[Granule (geology)|Granule]] – Between 2 and 4&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.
*[[Pebble]] – Between 4 – 64&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.
*[[Cobble (geology)|Cobble]] – between 6.4 and 25.6&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter
*[[Boulder]] – more than 25.6&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.

Stream substrate can affect the life found within the stream habitat. Muddy streams generally have more sediment in the water, reducing clarity. Clarity is one guide to stream health.

Marine substrate can be classified geologically as well. See Green et al., 1999 for a reference. 

Mollusks and clams that live in areas with substrate, and need them to survive, use their silky byssal threads to cling to it. See Cteniodes Ales for reference.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26253">The '''Supporting Healthy Marriage Project''' ('''SHM''') is part of the Healthy Marriage Initiative funded by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Administration for Children and Families]], that was launched in 2003 as "the first large-scale, multisite, multiyear, rigorous test of marriage education programs for low-income married couples". The project is motivated by research that "indicates that married adults and children raised by both parents in stable, low-conflict households do better on a host of outcomes". The evaluation is led by [[MDRC]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdrc.org MDRC website]&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with [[Abt Associates]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abtassociates.com/ Abt Associates website]&lt;/ref&gt; and other partners.&lt;ref name=mdrc&gt;[http://www.mdrc.org/project/supporting-healthy-marriage Manpower Development Research Corporation (MDRC), New York, NY]&lt;/ref&gt; USASpending.gov reports payments of more than $30 million from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services  to MDRC for work on the Supporting Healthy Marriage Project from 2009 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usaspending.gov/search?form_fields=%7B%22search_term%22%3A%22mdrc%22%7D USAspending.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

Major study questions of the Supporting Healthy Marriage Project include:&lt;ref name=opre&gt;Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, D.C. [http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/research/project/supporting-healthy-marriages-2003-2013]&lt;/ref&gt; 
# What are the experiences, issues and challenges in designing, implementing and operating healthy marriage education and related services for lower-income couples with children? 
# What are the net impacts of the programs on: marital stability and relationship quality; attitudes and expectations regarding their marriage; parenting attitudes and behaviors; measures of adult well-being and child well-being and development (e.g., cognitive, social, emotional, health), and economic outcomes for families?

Limited federal funding for a Healthy Marriage Initiative began in 2001 to "help couples who choose to get married gain greater access to [[relationship education|marriage education]] services that will enable them to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to form and sustain a healthy marriage."&lt;ref name=acf&gt;Administration for Children and Families, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, D.C. [http://publications.usa.gov/epublications/childenf/marriage.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Wade Horn]], Assistant Secretary for the Administration for Children and Families, highlighted plans for a significant expansion of funding in testimony before the Subcommittee on 21st Century Competitiveness, House Committee on Education and the Workforce:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Although I have focused on the areas of primary interest to your committee, I would be remiss if I did not briefly highlight other key areas of our proposal that play a critical role in the well-being of children, teenagers, and families. Indeed, we establish improving the well-being of children as the overarching purpose of [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families|TANF]].... In support of that overarching purpose, our proposal seeks to improve child well-being through programs aimed at encouraging responsible fatherhood and healthy marriages. By discontinuing the Out of Wedlock Birth Reduction Bonus and redirecting part of the High Performance Bonus Funding, we provide $200 million for programs aimed at promoting family formation and healthy marriages. We also provide $40 million in funding for the support of responsible fatherhood and healthy marriage programs to reverse the rise in father absence and its subsequent impact on children."&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of Wade F. Horn on Welfare Reform Reauthorization, March 15, 2005.[https://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t050315.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Rationale==

When the program was launched, [[Heritage Foundation]] explained: "The erosion of marriage during the past four decades has had large-scale negative effects on both children and adults: It lies at the heart of many of the social problems with which the government currently grapples. The beneficial effects of marriage on individuals and society are beyond reasonable dispute, and there is a broad and growing consensus that government policy should promote rather than discourage healthy marriage. In response to these trends, President [[George W. Bush]] has proposed--as part of [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program#1996 Welfare Reform and subsequent amendments|welfare reform reauthorization]]--the creation of a pilot program to promote healthy and stable marriage. Participation in the program would be strictly voluntary. Funding for the program would be small-scale: $300 million per year. This sum represents one penny to promote healthy marriage for every five dollars government currently spends to subsidize single parenthood. Moreover, this small investment today could result in potentially great savings in the future by reducing dependence on welfare and other social services."&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;Rector, Robert and Pardue, Melissa. The Heritage Foundation, "Understanding the President's Healthy Marriage Initiative," May 26, 2004. [http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2004/03/understanding-the-presidents-healthy-marriage-initiative]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ocs&gt;Office of Community Services, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, D.C. [http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ocs/resource/im-no-89-healthy-marriage-initiative-under-csbg]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proponents==

The [[Heritage Foundation]] and [[Brookings Institution]] were early proponents.

"By fostering better life decisions and stronger relationship skills, marriage programs can increase child well-being and adult happiness and reduce child poverty and welfare dependence. Yet opponents make it sound as if the government would be forcing people into unhappy unions. It's nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;The Heritage Foundation, "Senators, Experts to Speak Out for "Healthy Marriage Initiative," March 26, 2004. [http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2004/03/senators-experts-to-speak-out-for-healthy-marriage-initiative]&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Federal and state legislation enacted over the past decade clearly reflects a growing national interest in reducing the number of children growing up without both parents.... The central policy question is whether it is possible to implement programs that can increase the number of children who are raised by both parents in healthy and stable marriages, especially within disadvantaged populations known to be at higher risk for family instability."&lt;ref&gt;Dion, M. Robin. "The Future of Children," Princeton-Brookings, Marriage and Child Wellbeing, Volume 15, Number 2, Fall 2005.[http://futureofchildren.org/publications/journals/article/index.xml?journalid=37&amp;articleid=110&amp;sectionid=712]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 testimony to a House Appropriations Subcommittee, [[Wade Horn]] further highlighted the program's goals in a request for increased funding:&lt;ref name=horn&gt;Horn, Wade. "The Marriage Calculator," Testimony Before Subcommittee on Appropriations, April 2006.{{cite web |url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/olab/resource/testimony-on-marriage-calucator |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231085737/http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/olab/resource/testimony-on-marriage-calucator |archivedate=2012-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"As you know, research shows that healthy and stable marriages support children and limit the need for government programs.  Whether the problem is abuse, neglect, or poverty, the evidence is clear that the best chance a child has of avoiding these problems is to grow up with their mother and father in a stable, healthy marriage. Research also shows that adults in healthy marriages are happier and healthier.  A report from the [[Institute for American Values]] suggests that communities with high rates of healthy marriages evidence fewer social problems such as crime and welfare dependency, compared to those with low rates of healthy marriages.... The new funding will support a variety of activities that will provide interested individuals and couples with the skills and knowledge necessary to form and sustain healthy marriages. For example, it will allow us to fund programs to: help high school students learn to develop healthy relationships and gain knowledge about the value and benefits of healthy marriage for themselves and their future children, if they desire to marry and have children; offer pre-marital services to help engaged couples focus on topics critical to the long-term health of their relationship and marriage; offer help to married couples who are struggling, to gain skills to revitalize and strengthen their marriage; work with non-married pregnant women and expectant fathers interested in marriage to gain the skills that are necessary to form and sustain healthy marriages and help them with parenting and financial management skills as well as with finding employment or advancing to higher wage jobs; and reduce the disincentives to marriage in means-tested aid if offered in conjunction with any of the above mentioned activities. In addition, to expand the initiative provided in the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993|Deficit Reduction Act]], the Administration’s FY 2007 budget proposes to establish a competitive matching grant program for family formation and marriage. One hundred million dollars in competitive grants would be targeted to innovative approaches to promoting healthy marriage and reducing out-of-wedlock births."&lt;ref name="horn"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early concerns==

"Although promoting marriage is undeniably a laudable aim, whether government programs can effectively promote marriage is far from certain. Government has virtually no track record on this issue. Moreover, before Congress commits to making significant investments in an unproven arena, policy makers must address an even more fundamental question:  Can marriage really be a panacea that helps poor women and their children lead better lives or are supporters of marriage promotion overpromising the benefits of their agenda?  Answering this question isn’t easy. Although the empirical evidence in support of marriage is incontrovertible, there is still a great deal we need to know before state [TANF] programs move too rapidly into uncharted territory.  Studies on the  'retreat from marriage' in the United States abound, but we have surprisingly little information about the marital behavior of those women about whom policy makers are most concerned: low-income and welfare-dependent unwed mothers."&lt;ref&gt;Lichter, Daniel. "Marriage as Public Policy," Progressive Policy Institute, Cornell University, September 2001.[http://www.human.cornell.edu/pam/outreach/upload/marriage_lichter.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
"Marriage promotion represents a cornerstone of social conservatives' domestic policy agenda, and proposals designed to promote and strengthen marriage are gaining currency at all levels of government. Since taking office, President Bush has promised to invest in marriage promotion on an unprecedented scale through his proposal to reauthorize the nation's welfare reform law, and legislation pending before Congress would allocate substantial funding toward that end. Yet even as the president waits for Congress to act, his administration is finding ways to devote significant funding to marriage promotion activities through existing programs and funding streams.&lt;ref&gt;Dailard, Cynthia. The Guttmacher Report on Public Policy
February 2005, Volume 8, Number 1.[http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/tgr/08/1/gr080101.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

"A variety of new federal and state initiatives are attempting to promote family formation and healthy marriage among interested couples, including poor and minority couples who have had babies outside marriage. Careful evaluations of these programs should identify which are most effective.&lt;ref&gt;Haskins, Ron; Donahue, Elisabeth; McLanahan, Sara. "The Decline in Marriage: What To Do," Brookings Institution, September 2005.[http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2005/09/fall-childrenfamilies-haskins]&lt;/ref&gt;

"A marriage movement is underway, as efforts to promote marriage, strengthen two-parent families and reduce divorce gain momentum around the country.  And yet, no one can say with certainty how the government should effectively put marriage education and promotion programs into place, or if those programs will achieve their desired goals."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Claire. "Marriage Promotion:  Will It Work?" Rockefeller Institute of Government, The Roundtable on Religion and Social Welfare Policy, June 2004.{{cite web |url=http://www.rockinst.org/pdf/faith-based_social_services/2004-06-marriage_promotion_will_it_work.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522175946/http://www.rockinst.org/pdf/faith-based_social_services/2004-06-marriage_promotion_will_it_work.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Some states are poised to develop and provide programs to support healthy marriages, as called for by the Bush administration.... If political support for these programs is to grow, evidence that they work for the right populations will be critical."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urban.org/toolkit/issues/marriage.cfm The Urban Institute, "Making Marriage Work," 2012] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926132257/http://www.urban.org/toolkit/issues/marriage.cfm |date=2012-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==

"With congressional Republicans beating the drum about [[Spendthrift|profligate]] and wasteful government spending, they may want to take a hard look at a federal program pushed by a host of top GOPers during the Bush-era and reauthorized in late 2010, as the Republican deficit craze took hold. Originally championed by Republican lawmakers including Iowa Sen. [[Chuck Grassley]], former Pennsylvania Sen. [[Rick Santorum]], and current Kansas Gov. [[Sam Brownback]], a federal initiative to promote marriage as a cure for poverty dumped hundreds of millions of dollars into programs that either had no impact or a negative effect on the relationships of the couples who took part."&lt;ref&gt;Mencimer, Stephanie. "The GOP's Dead-End Marriage Program," Mother Jones, June 25, 2012.[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/06/gops-dead-end-marriage-program]&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Alternatives to Marriage Project opposes marriage promotion because it stigmatizes unmarried people and institutionalizes discrimination against singles and diverse family forms. We believe that policies designed to help children should focus on supporting all the types of families in which children really live. We believe that people who care for one another should be supported in their efforts to build healthy, happy relationships ... There is no evidence that it is an effective way to help people escape poverty. It diverts funds from poverty-fighting programs that have been proven to work."&lt;ref&gt;"Government Mandated Marriage Promotion," Alternatives to Marriage Project, Seattle, Washington.{{cite web |url=http://www.unmarried.org/welfare.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702114934/http://www.unmarried.org/welfare.html |archivedate=2011-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial findings==

===Program impact===
[[File:SHM PAIRS Couple.jpg|thumb|Couple practices communication skills during [[PAIRS Foundation]] [[relationship education]] class in Florida.]]
In an early impact study on the effectiveness of "skills-based [[relationship education]] programs designed to help low-income married couples strengthen their relationships and, in turn, to support more stable and more nurturing home environments and more positive outcomes for parents and their children," MDRC reported:&lt;ref name=impact&gt;Knox, Virginia, et al. "Early Impacts from the Supporting Healthy Marriage Evaluation," MDRC, New York, NY, March 2012.[http://www.mdrc.org/early-impacts-supporting-healthy-marriage-evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The SHM program produced a consistent pattern of small positive effects on multiple aspects of couples’ relationships. Relative to the control group, the program group showed higher levels of marital happiness, lower levels of marital distress, greater warmth and support, more positive communication, and fewer negative behaviors and emotions in their interactions with their spouses. The consistency of results across outcomes and data sources (surveys and independent observations of couple interactions) is noteworthy.
* Compared with individuals in the control group, program group members reported experiencing slightly less psychological and physical abuse from their spouses. Men and women in the program group reported less psychological abuse in their relationships, and men in the program group reported that their spouses physically assaulted them less often, compared with their control group counterparts.
* Men and women in the program group reported slightly lower levels of adult psychological distress (such as feelings of sadness or anxiety) than their control group counterparts.
* The program did not significantly affect whether couples stayed married at the 12-month follow-up point.

The initial impact report is based on 12-month follow-up with 4,989 program participants and control groups at sites in Florida (Orlando), Kansas (Wichita), Pennsylvania (Reading and Bethlehem), Texas (El Paso and San Antonio), New York (Bronx), Oklahoma (Oklahoma City), and Washington (Shoreline and Seattle).&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;

===Program implementation===
A separate study on program implementation reported:&lt;ref name=implementation&gt;Knox, Virginia, et al. "Final Implementation Findings from the Supporting Healthy Marriage Evaluation," MDRC, August 2012. [http://www.mdrc.org/final-implementation-findings-supporting-healthy-marriage-evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henthorn, Robert. "National Study Shows Strong Consumer Satisfaction with Marriage and Relationship Education Classes," Fatherhood Channel, October 17, 2012. [http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2012/10/17/national-marriage-education-study-117/]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Local programs implemented the SHM model in  adherence with established guidelines. Program designers and evaluators consider the implemented programs a fair field test of the SHM model. The core marriage education workshops were implemented consistently across program locations, but there was more variation in implementation of the other two program components. 
[[File:Supporting-Healthy-Marriage-Research-Graph-X32.1.jpg|thumb|SHM Implementation Data]]
[[File:Supporting-Healthy-Marriage-Research-Graph-X31.jpg|thumb|SHM Implementation Data]]

[[File:SHM Time with Spouse.jpg|thumb|SHM Implementation Data]]
[[File:SHM Reasons for Not Attending.jpg|thumb|SHM Implementation Data]]
* Couples engaged in SHM services and  continued participating over time.  Ninety-one percent of couples participated in at least one program service. On average, couples completed 27 hours of services across the three components, and those who initiated attendance remained engaged for approximately eight months.  
* Multiple strategies supported the implementation process. Written curricula, protocols, and performance benchmarks established expectations for the content, frequency, and quality of SHM services. Technical assistance teams held programs accountable for working toward their goals, and they offered assistance to improve programs’ performance over time.   
* Couples who enrolled are a diverse and relatively disadvantaged group. Most couples who enrolled in SHM had low or modest income; many are Hispanic; and more than half reported thinking that their marriage was in trouble in the past year.  
* SHM services were implemented in diverse agency settings. Host agencies include community-based organizations, private for-profit entities, a hospital, and a university. Within the broad parameters of the program model, these agencies played an important role in shaping implementation.

==Curricula evaluated==

===Within Our Reach===

* Curriculum Length: 28 Hours
* Languages: English and Spanish
* Publisher: PREP, Inc.

“WOR addresses factors that are associated with relationship quality or stability in longitudinal studies with middle-class couples. WOR takes a cognitive-behavioral approach to relationship and marriage education, with the goal of helping couples modify their behavior and thoughts about their relationship to reduce, and better manage, negative moods and emotions. Also central to WOR’s approach is its focus on different types of safety characterized as essential to maintaining healthy relationships: safety in interaction (can talk openly about issues), personal safety (freedom from fear of harm), and safety in commitment (mutual support, teamwork, and a clear future together).”&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt;

===Becoming Parents Program===

* Curriculum Length: 30 Hours
* Languages: English and Spanish
* Publisher: PREP, Inc.

“BPP is intended for couples who are expecting or have recently had a child together. BPP is based on the PREP curriculum, which contributes much of the curriculum’s material on strengthening couple relationships. BPP’s primary focus is on helping participants prepare their relationships for the challenges of parenthood, thereby building protective factors and reducing adverse experiences for their children. BPP includes empirically based information on child development and parenting, and it teaches skills for reducing common relationship and personal stressors following the addition of a new baby, with particular emphasis on relationship skill-building, self-care, information about infants, and building support networks to reduce isolation.”&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt;

===For Our Future, For Our Family===

* Curriculum Length: 30 Hours
* Languages: English and Spanish
* Publisher: [[PAIRS Foundation]] 

“Objectives of FOF are to help couples deepen intimacy on a foundation of emotional literacy, including skills for recognizing, navigating, and expressing a range of emotions; enhancing interpersonal communication; and constructively addressing differences and conflicts on behalf of a shared relationship vision. The curriculum helps each spouse know and nurture oneself and one’s partner, enjoy differences rather than see them as a threat, and learn to create a relationship that is an ongoing source of pleasure for both partners. FOF emphasizes bonding (emotional openness and physical closeness) in the relationship as a central theme.”&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt;

===Loving Couples, Loving Children===

* Curriculum Length: 24 Hours
* Languages: English and Spanish
* Publisher: LCLC, Inc.

“LCLC is organized around the concept that the underpinning of a healthy relationship is a strong friendship, as indicated by positive emotions shared in nonconflict interactions. In addition, LCLC proposes a four-part process for problem-solving that includes gentle start-up of challenging conversations, accepting the validity of multiple perspectives, becoming skilled at repair-and-recovery conversations and at compromise. In LCLC workshops, couples are encouraged to share their hopes for themselves and their marriage and to explore the personal experiences that shape their beliefs and expectations. By discovering and validating each spouse’s values and dreams, the couple can reduce damaging interactions related to recurring problems and can build a sense of shared meaning and identity as a couple.”&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt;

'''Timing of CAB expression 1''' is a [[protein]] that in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is encoded by the '''TOC1''' [[gene]].  TOC1 is also known as '''two-component response regulator-like APRR1'''.

TOC1 was the first plant gene that, when mutated, yielded a circadian phenotype. It codes for the [[transcription factor]] TOC1, which affects the period of plants' [[circadian rhythms]]: built-in, malleable oscillations that repeat every 24 hours. The gene codes for a transcriptional [[repressor]], TOC1, one of five pseudo-response regulators (PRR) that mediate the period of the circadian clock in plants. The TOC1 protein is involved in the clock's evening loop, which is a [[repressilator]] that directly inhibits transcription of morning loop genes [[LHY]] and [[CCA1]].&lt;ref name="Fujiwara"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fujiwara S, Wang L, Han L, Suh SS, Salomé PA, McClung CR, Somers DE | title = Post-translational regulation of the Arabidopsis circadian clock through selective proteolysis and phosphorylation of pseudo-response regulator proteins | journal = J.

== Historical context ==

=== Discovery ===

The TOC1 gene was initially discovered by Prof. Andrew Millar and colleagues in 1995 while Millar was a graduate student. Millar developed an innovative forward genetic screen in which he linked a [[bioluminescent]] reporter, firefly ([[luciferase]]), to expression of CAB (chlorophyll-a,b binding protein—see [[Light-harvesting complexes of green plants]]) in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana|Arabidopsis]]''. By measuring bioluminescence over the course of the day, Millar found CAB expression to display oscillatory patterns in constant light and to oscillate with a shorter period in toc1 mutant plants. He also mapped the toc1 gene to chromosome 5. These methods and discoveries were published in and featured on the cover of ''Science'' magazine in February 1995.&lt;ref name="Millar"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Millar AJ, Carré IA, Strayer CA, Chua NH, Kay SA | title = Circadian clock mutants in Arabidopsis identified by luciferase imaging | journal = Science | volume = 267 | issue = 5201 | pages = 1161–3 |date=February 1995 | pmid = 7855595 | doi =10.1126/science.7855595 | bibcode = 1995Sci...267.1161M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partially because the initial studies of clock genes were conducted in ''[[Drosophila]]'' in the 1970s and then in mammals, it was originally thought that the plant circadian clock functioned similarly to the mammalian clock. In mammals, positive and negative regulatory elements act in feedback loops to drive circadian oscillations; namely, Per and Cry genes are activated by positive elements CLOCK and BMAL to produce proteins that, when phosphorylated, act as negative elements to inhibit the CLOCK:BMAL complex from its activating function. In this way, Per and Cry inhibit their own transcription.&lt;ref name=Ko&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 |date=October 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23604473"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buhr ED, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the Mammalian circadian clock | journal = Handb Exp Pharmacol | volume = 217 | issue = | pages = 3–27 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23604473 | doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-25950-0_1 | series = Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology | isbn = 978-3-642-25949-4 | pmc=3762864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Millar's group found the TOC1 protein to be a negative regulator, and the plant clock to be better modeled as a [[repressilator]]—a system in which one gene represses another and is in turn repressed by the next, forming an interdependent, oscillating gene network. This finding was achieved through 1) ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana|Arabidopsis]]'' mutants with constitutive (always turned on) toc1 [[gene expression]], which showed decreased mRNA abundance in both morning loop genes prr7 and 9, cca1, and lhy and evening loop genes gi and elf4; and 2) plants with mutations in toc1 and plants in which [[RNAi]] was used to knock out toc1. These mutants with no functional toc1 showed an advanced phase for lhy, suggesting less repression in the absence of TOC1 protein.&lt;ref name = "Huang"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huang W, Pérez-García P, Pokhilko A, Millar AJ, Antoshechkin I, Riechmann JL, Mas P | title = Mapping the core of the Arabidopsis circadian clock defines the network structure of the oscillator | journal = Science | volume = 336 | issue = 6077 | pages = 75–9 |date=April 2012 | pmid = 22403178 | doi = 10.1126/science.1219075 |bibcode = 2012Sci...336...75H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Carl Strayer and colleagues found that toc1 gene's transcriptional involvement shortened circadian rhythms in constant dark in addition to constant light, and that TOC1 was circadianly regulated and involved in regulation of its own feedback loop.&lt;ref name = "Strayer"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Strayer C, Oyama T, Schultz TF, Raman R, Somers DE, Más P, Panda S, Kreps JA, Kay SA | title = Cloning of the Arabidopsis clock gene TOC1, an autoregulatory response regulator homolog | journal = Science | volume = 289 | issue = 5480 | pages = 768–71 |date=August 2000 | pmid = 10926537 | doi =10.1126/science.289.5480.768 | bibcode = 2000Sci...289..768S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary History===
* '''Homologs'''

Homologs of TOC1 have been found in Lyrate rockcress, [[Brassica]], [[papaya]], [[cucumber]], [[strawberry]], [[soybean]], [[lotus (genus)|lotus]], [[apple]], [[peach]], western poplar ([[populus]]), [[castor bean]], [[tomato]], [[potato]], [[grape vine]], and [[chickpea]].&lt;ref name="urlPlant Genome Duplication Database"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://chibba.agtec.uga.edu/duplication/index/locus_app?lc=AT5G61380 | title =  AT5G61380 Locus Search  | work = Plant Genome Duplication Database | publisher = University of Georgia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Polymorphisms'''

21 polymorphisms have been found in ''Arabidopsis'', including substitutions, insertions, and deletions.&lt;ref name="urlLocus Detail"/&gt;

== Protein characteristics ==

=== Structural motifs ===

Like the other four PRR proteins found in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana|Arabidopsis]]'', TOC1 is located in the nucleus and employs a pseudo-receiver (PR) [[Protein domain|domain]] in the [[N-terminus]] and a CONSTANS, CONSTANS-LIKE, and TOC1 (CCT) domain at the [[C-terminus]].&lt;ref name="Fujiwara"/&gt; Through its CCT domain, TOC1 is able to directly bind [[DNA]], and the PR domain is responsible for transcriptional repression activity.&lt;ref name="pmid22315425"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gendron JM, Pruneda-Paz JL, Doherty CJ, Gross AM, Kang SE, Kay SA | title = Arabidopsis circadian clock protein, TOC1, is a DNA-binding transcription factor | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 109 | issue = 8 | pages = 3167–72 |date=February 2012 | pmid = 22315425 | pmc = 3286946 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1200355109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.3167G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Functions and interactions ===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TOC1 interactions.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the morning (yellow) and evening (gray) circadian clock loops in ''Arabidopsis'', entrainable through light. Transcriptional regulation is shown through black lines and protein complexes are denoted by dashed black lines. Post-translational regulation is shown by dashed red lines. Light sensitive elements are denoted with lightning bolts and yellow circles.]] --&gt;

TOC1 binds to the G-box and EE-motif promoter regions of genes involved in both the morning and evening transcription-translation feedback loops that drive the plant circadian clock; these genes include PRR7 and 9, CCA1, and LHY in the morning feedback loop and GI and ELF4 in the evening loop. Discrete induction of TOC1 gene expression results in reduced CCA1 and PRR9 expression, indicating that TOC1 plays a repressive rather than stimulatory role in regulating circadian gene expression.&lt;ref name="Huang"/&gt; Repression of morning loop genes lhy and cca1 was predicted by computational modeling and was the piece of evidence needed to re-define toc1's role in the plant clock as part of a triple negative-component [[repressilator]] model rather than a positive/negative-element system of the sort seen in mammals.&lt;ref name="Pokhilko"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pokhilko A, Fernández AP, Edwards KD, Southern MM, Halliday KJ, Millar AJ | title = The clock gene circuit in Arabidopsis includes a repressilator with additional feedback loops | journal = Mol. Syst. Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 574 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22395476 | pmc = 3321525 | doi = 10.1038/msb.2012.6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The binding pattern of TOC1's CCT domain exhibits circadian oscillations, with maximum binding to G-box and EE motifs—promoter regions that bind transcription factors—occurring at CT15 in the plant's early subjective night.&lt;ref name="pmid22315425" /&gt; It was shown through the loss of binding rhythms in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana|Arabidopsis]]'' mutants with constitutive TOC1 expression that oscillations in TOC1 binding are regulated by the protein's abundance.&lt;ref name="Huang"/&gt;

TOC1 also appears to be involved in a feedback loop with [[abscisic acid]], a key plant hormone involved in development and stress response. '' Arabidopsis '' plants to which varying amounts of ABA were applied showed corresponding differences in TOC1 expression and in circadian period length. Through computational modeling of this feedback loop, TOC1 was shown to be a clock-based influence on patterns of [[stoma]] opening and closure, which has traditionally been described as a mainly ABA-regulated process.&lt;ref name="pmid23506153"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pokhilko A, Mas P, Millar AJ | title = Modelling the widespread effects of TOC1 signalling on the plant circadian clock and its outputs | journal = BMC Syst Biol | volume = 7| pages = 23 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23506153 | pmc = 3614443 | doi = 10.1186/1752-0509-7-23  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-translational modifications ===

Over the circadian cycle, TOC1 is differentially [[phosphorylated]], with peak phosphorylation occurring during the night.&lt;ref name="Fujiwara"/&gt; In the highly phosphorylated state, TOC1 has a higher binding affinity to the [[F-box protein]] ZEITLUPE (ZTL).&lt;ref name="Fujiwara"/&gt; In addition to controlling TOC1 - ZTL interactions, phosphorylation of the N-terminus of TOC1 protein increases interaction with PRR3, one of the five PRR proteins found in ''Arabidopsis''.&lt;ref name="Fujiwara"/&gt; From studies with ztl-1 mutants, which have a single [[missense mutation]] in the kelch domain of the protein and effectively cause a ztl [[null mutation]], TOC1 protein has been found to be stabilized and TOC1 cycling largely eliminated.&lt;ref name="Fujiwara"/&gt; While phosphorylation of TOC1 protein stabilizes interactions with ZTL, it also increases TOC1's affinity for PRR3.&lt;ref name="Fujiwara"/&gt; This ultimately protects TOC1 from ZTL-mediated degradation.&lt;ref name="Fujiwara"/&gt; PRR3 acts as a competitive inhibitor for the ZTL-TOC1 interaction, as binding of TOC1 to PRR3 results in decreased TOC1 substrate availability for ZTL-dependent degradation.&lt;ref name="Fujiwara"/&gt; This results in an enhanced amplitude of TOC1 cycling, implying that stable TOC1 cycling is dependent upon ZTL degradation in addition to transcriptional regulation controls.&lt;ref name="Fujiwara"/&gt;

== Agricultural use ==
To most efficiently use environmental resources such as light, plants generally synchronize their circadian rhythms to match the period of the environment. In a study published in 2005, it was shown that plants whose circadian period matched the period of the light-dark cycle in its environment had increased photosynthesis and growth.&lt;ref name="pmid16040710"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dodd AN, Salathia N, Hall A, Kévei E, Tóth R, Nagy F, Hibberd JM, Millar AJ, Webb AA | title = Plant circadian clocks increase photosynthesis, growth, survival, and competitive advantage | journal = Science | volume = 309 | issue = 5734 | pages = 630–3 |date=July 2005 | pmid = 16040710 | doi = 10.1126/science.1115581 |bibcode = 2005Sci...309..630D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this knowledge, botanists can take advantage of a mutation in the toc1 gene that has been shown to decrease the period of a plant. It is plausible that these toc1 mutants can easily be used to produce plants in a shorter amount of time, with a smaller amount of energy.

The precise '''[[Plant taxonomy|taxonomy]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Allium]]''''' is still poorly understood with incorrect descriptions being widespread. With over 850 species distributed over the [[Northern hemisphere]] ''Allium'' is the sole genus in the [[Allieae]], one of four [[Tribe (biology)|tribe]]s of [[subfamily]] [[Allioideae]] ([[Amaryllidaceae]]). New species continue to be described{{sfn|Deniz et al.|2015}} and ''Allium'' is both highly variable and one of the largest monocotyledonous genera,{{sfn|Li et al.|2010}} but the precise [[Plant taxonomy|taxonomy]] of ''Allium'' is poorly understood,{{sfn|Li et al.|2010}}{{sfn|Deniz et al.|2015}} with incorrect descriptions being widespread. The difficulties arise from the fact that the genus displays considerable polymorphism and has adapted to a wide variety of habitats. Furthermore, traditional classications had been based on [[homoplasious]] characteristics (the independent evolution of similar features in species of different lineages). However, the genus has been shown to be [[monophyletic]], containing three major [[clades]], although some proposed subgenera are not.{{sfn|Li et al.|2010}} Some progress is being made using molecular phylogenetic methods, and the [[internal transcribed spacer]] (ITS) region, including the 5.8S [[ribosomal DNA|rDNA]] and the two [[spacer DNA|spacers]] ITS1 and ITS2, is one of the more commonly used markers in the study of the differentiation of the ''Allium'' species.{{sfn|Deniz et al.|2015}}

''Allium'' includes a number of taxonomic groupings previously considered separate genera (''Caloscordum'' Herb., ''Milula'' Prain and ''Nectaroscordum'' Lindl.) ''Allium spicatum'' had been treated by many authors as ''Milula spicata'', the only species in the [[Monotypic taxon|monospecific]] genus ''Milula''. In 2000, it was shown to be [[Paraphyly|embedded]] in ''Allium''.{{sfn|Friesen et al.|2000}}
{{TOC limit|5}}

== Description ==

The [[genus]] ''Allium'' are [[herbaceous]] [[geophytes]] is characterised by [[bulbs]] enclosed in membranous tunics, that may become fibrous and may be carried on [[rhizomes]], with [[tepals]] that are free or almost free, and a subgynobasic [[style (botany)|style]]. The majority of [[species]] produce [[cysteine]] [[sulphoxides]] that are the source of their distinctive garlic and onion odor and taste. About twenty species are grown as [[edible crops]], such as [[onions]], [[garlic]] and [[leek]]s, while others are [[foraged]] from the wild, such as [[Allium tricoccum|ramps]]. Many species are [[xerophytic]] and the over 850 species are found almost exclusively in the [[Northern hemisphere]], being particularly diverse in the warm dry summers and cool wet winters of the [[Mediterranean]].{{sfn|Deniz et al.|2015}} The main [[centre of diversity]] is the [[Old World]] with species rich areas in [[Central Asia]] as well as the [[Mediterranean Basin]]. A second centre, in the [[New World]], is western North America.&lt;ref name=Dahlgrenal/&gt;{{sfn|Wheeler et al.|2013}}

== History ==
[[File:Linnaeus Allium 1753.jpg|thumb|[[Linnaeus]]' description of ''Allium'', [[Species Plantarum]] 1753]]
Descriptions of ''Allium'' taxonomy date back at least as far as [[Carolus Clusius]]' ''Rariarum plantarum historia'' (1601).{{sfn|Clusius|1601}} When Linnaeus&lt;ref name=Linnaeusal/&gt; formerly described the genus ''Allium'' in his ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' (1753), there were thirty species with this name. He placed ''Allium'' in a grouping he referred to as ''Hexandria monogynia''&lt;ref name=Linnaeushex/&gt; (i.e. six stamens and one [[pistil]]) containing 51 genera in all.{{sfn|Linnaeus Sexual System|2015}} In 1763, [[Adanson]], who proposed the concept of families of plants, included ''Allium'' and related genera as a grouping within '[[Liliaceae]]'&lt;ref name=Adansonlil/&gt; as Section IV, ''Les Oignons'' (Onions), or ''Cepae'' in Latin.&lt;ref name=Adansoncep/&gt; [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu|De Jussieu]] is officially recognised as the first formal establishment of the suprageneric grouping into families (Ordo) in 1789. In this system ''Allium'' was one of fourteen genera in Ordo VI, ''Asphodeles'' (Asphodeli), of the third class (''Stamina epigyna'') of [[Monocots]].&lt;ref name=Jussieu/&gt; [[Jean Henri Jaume Saint-Hilaire]] (1805), who developed the concept of [[Amaryllidaceae]], continued Jussieu's treatment of ''Allium'' under Asphodeli (which he considered [[synonymous]] with Adanson's Liliaceae and Jussieu's Asphodeli).&lt;ref name=sthilaire126/&gt; He placed ''Allium'' in an unnamed [[monotypic]] section of Asphodeli defined as ''Fleurs en ombelle, racine bulbeuse. Calice à six parties egales'' ([[umbellate]] flowers, [[bulbous]], [[Calyx (flower)|calyx]] of six equal parts).&lt;ref name=sthilaire132/&gt;

Subsequently, [[de Candolle]] reverted the family name back to Liliaceae from Asphodeli.&lt;ref name=Candollelil/&gt; He divided the Liliaceae into a series of Ordres, and the second ordre was named ''Asphodèles'', based on Jussieus' family of that name,&lt;ref name=Candolleasph/&gt; in which he placed ''Allium''.&lt;ref name="Candolleasph"/&gt; The term 'Alliaceae' then reappeared in its subfamilial form, Allieae, in [[Dumortier]]'s ''Florula Belgica'' (1827),&lt;ref name=Dumortier/&gt; with six genera. The 'Alliaceae' have been treated as Allieae within the Liliaceae (or Aspholecaceae, a partial synonym) family by most authorities since.

[[Regel]] produced a major monograph of the genus in 1875,{{sfn|von Regel|1875}} and this remained the major reference work for over 100 years till the molecularly based study of Friesen and colleagues in 2006.{{sfn|Friesen|Fritsch|Blattner|2006}} Despite recent advances the precise [[Plant taxonomy|taxonomy]] of [[Allium]] remains still poorly understood with incorrect descriptions being widespread.{{sfn|Saghir et al.|1966}}{{sfn|Li et al.|2010}}{{sfn|Deniz et al.|2015}}

== Subdivision ==

Linnaeus originally grouped his 30 species into three [[Alliance (taxonomy)|alliances]], ''e.g.'' ''Foliis caulinis planis'' and as the number of recognised species increased, so did the number of subgroups. Since then, many attempts have been made to divide the growing number of recognised species into infrageneric subgroupings, initially as sections, and then as subgenera further divided into sections. For a brief history, see Friesen ''et al.'' (2006){{sfn|Friesen|Fritsch|Blattner|2006}} and Li ''et al.'' (2010){{sfn|Li et al.|2010}} Regel's 1875 treatise on ''Allium'' divided his 262 species between the six sections proposed by [[George Don|Don]], in his 1832 monograph on the genus.{{sfn|Don|1832}} [[William T. Stearn|Stearn]] (1944) described 14 subgenera.{{sfn|Stearn|1944}} [[Hamilton Traub|Traub]] (1968) described 3 subgenera, 36 sections and subsections and about 600 species.{{sfn|Traub|1968}} By 1992 there were 6 sub-genera, 50 sections and subsections and 600–700 species.{{sfn|Hanelt et al.|1992a}} The situation was further confused by the presence of over 1,000 taxonomic names, many of which turned out to be [[synonyms]].{{sfn|Gregory et al.|1998}}{{sfn|Saghir et al.|1966}}

The modern era of [[phylogenetic analysis]] dates to 1996.{{sfn|von Berg et al.|1996}} In 2006 Friesen, Fritsch, and Blattner{{sfn|Friesen|Fritsch|Blattner|2006}} described a new classification with 15 [[subgenera]], 56 [[section (botany)|sections]], and about 780 species based on the [[cell nucleus|nuclear]] [[Ribosome|ribosomal]] [[gene]] [[internal transcribed spacer]]s. Some of the subgenera correspond to the once separate genera (''Caloscordum'', ''Milula'', ''Nectaroscordum'') included in the [[Gilliesieae]].{{sfn|Li et al.|2010}}{{sfn|Sykorova|2006}} The terminology has varied with some authors subdividing subgenera into Sections and others Alliances.

The term [[Alliance (taxonomy)|alliance]] has been used for both subgroupings within species, ''e.g.'' ''[[Allium nigrum]]'', as well as infrageneric subsections. These alliances are informal groupings based on morphological similarity and reflecting hypotheses of evolutionary relationship. and can be used between any two formal ranks.{{sfn|Fritsch et al.|2010}} For instance the some 70 North American species were divided into nine well-defined species alliances, of which the largest was the ''Allium falcifolium'' alliance with 31 taxa.{{sfn|Rieseberg et al.|1987}} These alliances are usually referred to as the Ownbey alliances, after Marion Ownbey{{sfn|Saghir et al.|1966}} and were also used by Traub.{{sfn|Traub|1968}} A number of classification schemes have chosen to retain these, the Traub system not being universally accepted.{{sfn|Friesen|Fritsch|Blattner|2006}}{{sfn|Wheeler et al.|2013}}

Subsequent [[molecular phylogenetic]] studies have shown the 2006 classification is a considerable improvement over previous classifications, but some of its subgenera and sections are probably not [[monophyletic]]. Meanwhile, the number of new species continued to increase, reaching 800 by 2009, 900 by 2016{{sfn|Koçyiğıt et al.|2016}} and the pace of discovery has not decreased. Detailed studies have focused on a number of subgenera, including ''Amerallium''. ''Amerallium'' is strongly [[Resampling (statistics)|supported]] as monophyletic.{{sfn|Nguyen et al.|2008}} Subgenus ''Melanocrommyum'' has also been the subject of considerable study (see below), while work on subgenus ''Allium'' has focused on section ''Allium'', including ''[[Allium ampeloprasum]]'', although [[Sample (material)|sampling]] was not sufficient to test the monophyly of the section.{{sfn|Hirschegger et al.|2010}}

The major [[evolutionary lineages]] or lines correspond to the three major clades. Line one (the oldest) with three subgenera is predominantly bulbous, the second, with five subgenera and the third with seven subgenera contain both bulbous and rhizomatous taxa.{{sfn|Li et al.|2010}} Banfi and colleagues (2011) have suggested that the phylogenetic trichotomy of this genus ''Allium'' ''[[sensu lato]]'' is sufficiently distinct as to warrant splitting it into three separate genera. Banfi's scheme thus proposes the restoring the three originally separate genera ''Nectaroscordum'' Lindl. (type: ''N. siculum''), ''Caloscordum'' Herb. (type: ''C. neriniflorum'') and ''Allium'' L. ''[[sensu stricto]]'' (type: ''A. sativum'') to correspond to lines 1-3.{{sfn|Banfi et al.|2011}}

==== First evolutionary line ====

Although this lineage consists of three subgenera, nearly all the species are attributed to subgenus ''Amerallium'', the third largest subgenus of ''Allium''. The lineage is considered to represent the most ancient line within ''Allium'', and to be the only lineage that is predominantly bulbous, the other two having both bulbous and rhizomatous taxa. ''Nectaroscordum'' and ''Microscordum'' are bulbous, but ''Amerallium'' contains some rhizomatous elements. Within this lineage ''Amerallium'' is a [[sister group]] to the other two subgenera (''Microscordum''+''Nectaroscordum'').{{sfn|Li et al.|2010}}

===== Subgenus ''Amerallium''=====

[[File:Allium canadense, 2015-06-10, Fox Chapel, 01.jpg|thumb|150px|Type species: ''[[Allium canadense]]'']]
This large monophyletic subgenus is extremely diverse, both morphologically and ecologically and is characterised by leaves with one row of [[vascular bundles]], absence of [[palisade parenchyma]] and a subepidermal position of [[laticifers]], with a predominant base [[chromosome number]] x=7.{{sfn|Li et al.|2010}}

;Taxonomy
''Amerallium'' is a relatively large subgenus with about 120–140 species. Under the alliance system of classification proposed by Ownbey (1966), species north of Mexico and two Mexican [[endemics]] were treated as eight informal alliances: the ''A. acuminatum'', ''A. campanulatum'', ''A. canadense'', ''A. cernuum'', ''A. falcifolium'', ''A. kunthii'', ''A. sanbornii'', and ''A. validum'' alliances.{{sfn|Saghir et al.|1966}} Traub (1968) then arranged the [[New World]] alliances into four sections: ''Amerallium'' Traub, ''Caulorhizideum'' Traub, ''Lophioprason'' Traub, and ''Rhopetoprason'' Traub. In addition he arranged the [[Old World]] species into 6 sections.{{sfn|Traub|1968}}
 
Since Traub's revision of the subgenus, two biogeographical sister clades (or alliances) have been recognised. The Old World clade is represented by two relatively small groups from the Mediterranean and East Asia. The larger New World clade by all North American species of ''Allium''. The New World sections are ''Lophioprason'', ''Amerallium'', and ''Rhophetoprason'', while the Old World is represented by sections ''Arctoprasum'', ''Briseis'', ''Narkissoprason'', ''Molium'', ''Bromatorrhiza'' and ''Rhynchocarpum''.{{sfn|Friesen|Fritsch|Blattner|2006}}

The subgenus is thought to originate in the Old World, with a later split, and to have its origin in the higher latitudes of [[East Asia]], at the time of transition from [[Cretaceous]] to [[Tertiary]], dispersing to western North America. Twelve sections were subsequently recognized, with sections ''Amerallium'' and ''Molium'' further split into two subsections.{{sfn|Friesen|Fritsch|Blattner|2006}}{{sfn|Li et al.|2010}}{{sfn|Wheeler et al.|2013}}

;Distribution
''Amerallium'' is widely distributed within North America, Europe, north Africa, Ethiopia, the Caucasus, northern Iran, southeast Tibet, and southwest China.{{sfn|Wheeler et al.|2013}} The greatest species diversity occurs in North America with 81 species recognized in the 2002 [[Flora of North America]] (north of Mexico)&lt;ref name=fna/&gt; and a further 13 are unique to Mexico,{{sfn|Serna|López-Ferrari|1992}} and a total of 26 species recognised there.{{sfn|Wheeler et al.|2013}} Within N America, the genus covers most of the area south of the [[53rd parallel north|53rd parallel]], including the oak hillsides of California and Oregon, deserts of Nevada and Texas, alpine meadows of Utah and Idaho, prairies of Nebraska and Manitoba, and forest glades of Missouri and Arkansas.{{sfn|Wheeler et al.|2013}}

;Uses
Both bulbous and rhizomatous species occur in both Old World and New World alliances. The subgenus includes both ornamentals, such as ''[[Allium moly|A. moly]]'', ''[[Allium roseum|A. roseum]]'', ''[[Allium unifolium|A. unifolium]]'' and ''[[Allium neapolitanum|A. neapolitanum]]'', and culinary species such as ''[[Allium ursinum|A. ursinum]]''.{{sfn|Friesen|Fritsch|Blattner|2006}}{{sfn|Wheeler et al.|2013}}

==== Second evolutionary line ====

Nearly all the species in this lineage of five subgenera are accounted for by subgenus ''Melanocrommyum'', which is most closely associated with subgenera ''Vvedenskya'' and ''Porphyroprason'', phylogenetically. These three genera are late-branching whereas the remaining two subgenera, ''Caloscordum'' and ''Anguinum'' are early branching.{{sfn|Li et al.|2010}} Of the five subgenera, the large ''Melanocrommymum'' and the oligo- or monotypic ''Caloscordum'', ''Vvedenskya'' and ''Porphyroprason'' are bulbous and the remaining small subgenus ''Anguinum'' is rhizomatous.{{sfn|Fritsch et al.|2010}}

===== Subgenus ''Melanocrommyum''=====
[[File:Allium nigrum GotBot 2015 003.jpg|thumb|150px|Type species: ''Allium nigrum'']]
This [[Eurasian]] subgenus, the second largest, is complex and has had a confusing taxonomic history and is extremely diverse, morphologically. It is distributed from the [[Mediterranean]] to the [[Near East|Near]] and [[Middle East]], to north-western China and Pakistan in the east, and southern [[Siberia]] in the north. The [[centre of diversity]] is Central Asia where it evolved, but its ancestry is located in East Asia.{{sfn|Li et al.|2010}} The 2006 classification of Fritsch and colleagues included 150 species but this has continued to grow. An extensive molecular based study in 2010 confirmed its monophyly but showed that the traditional sections were either [[paraphyletic|para-]] or [[polyphyletic]]. On the other hand, a number of monophyletic subgroups were recognised, with about 40 [[clades]], although their exact relationships remained not fully resolved. Consequently, traditional sections required considerable re-alignment. Eventually 160 species and subspecies were recognised in 20 sections and 22 subsections.{{sfn|Deniz et al.|2015}}{{sfn|Fritsch et al.|2010}}{{sfn|Fragman-Sapir|Fritsch|2011}}

Description: The subgenus is characterised by true tunicated bulbs, annual roots, leaves that are mostly broad and flat with subterranean sheath parts that are barely visible above the ground, scapes that are strong and most often strictly upright and of varying length, and large, fasciculate to globular inflorescences. The latter are composed of many moderately small to large, often star-like, flowers, and some of which have a sweet or noticeable odor.{{sfn|Fritsch et al.|2010}}{{sfn|Li et al.|2010}}

History: Early (prior to 1950) classifications of ''Allium'' included many of the members of this subgenus within the bulbous section, ''Mollium'' based on morphological characteristics. ''Mollium'' was later raised to subgenus level (and then again reduced to a section of ''Amerallium'' after transferring many species to ''Melanocrommyum''. The subgenus was then divided into sections in 1969. Molecular methods in the 1990s confirmed the identity of ''Melanocrommyum'' as a distinct monophyletic group, together with the presence of several subgroups, but the deeper relationships remained inconsistent.{{sfn|Fritsch et al.|2010}}

Subdivision: Subdivision of the subgenus was first proposed by [[Wendelbo]] in 1966,{{sfn|Wendelbo|1966}} proposing section ''Regeloprason'' Wendelbo, followed in 1969 by ''Melanocrommyum'' Webb &amp; Berthel., ''Kaloprason'' K. Koch, ''Acanthoprason'' Wendelbo, ''Megaloprason'' Wendelbo, and ''Thaumasioprason'' Wendelbo.{{sfn|Wendelbo|1969}} Kamelin (1973) provided an alternative arrangement of sections,{{sfn|Kamelin|1973}} which was supplanted by the Gatersleben ''Allium'' Group classification (1992) which used a broad range of variables.{{sfn|Hanelt et al.|1992a}}

The use of molecular markers to develop phylogeny began in the 1990s and showed that the subgenus was a well separated taxon with a number of subgeneric groupings. Friesen and colleagues (2006) carried out an extensive molecular phylogenetic study {{sfn|Friesen|Fritsch|Blattner|2006}} resulting in a taxonomy based on 15 sections. These were then further subdivided into five of the sections to create 17 subsections. While ''Melanocrommyum'' itself appeared monophyletic, most of the sections were either para- or polyphyletic, favouring the formation of a larger number of smaller subgroups. In their study there were a number of larger sections with 15–35 species, ''Acmopetala'', ''Megaloprason'', ''Regeloprason'',  ''Kaloprason'', and ''Acanthoprason''. The remaining sections are either [[oligogotypic]] with 2–8 species (''Compactoprason'', ''Pseudoprason'', ''Miniprason'', ''Brevicaule'', ''Thaumasioprason'', ''Verticillata'') or monotypic (''Acaule'', ''Aroidea'', ''Popovia'').

In a more focused study in 2010 this was expanded to 20 sections and 22 subsections, or in some cases, ''e.g.'' section ''Melanocrommyum'' (type: ''A. nigrum'') into nine alliances and ''Acanthoprason'' into seven.{{sfn|Fritsch et al.|2010}} This section is the most diverse one within the subgenus in which subgroups differ according to the relationships of the lengths of leaves and scapes (leaves shorter, equal or longer than scapes) and inflorescences (fasciculate, umbellate or subglobose).{{sfn|Fritsch et al.|2006}} The increased number of sections resulted from the splitting of some of the earlier sections, such as ''Acmopetala''. The two species in the resulting section ''Longibidentata'' are sister to all the remaining sections (core clade). This section, together with another new section, ''Decipientia'' form the [[basal clade]]. Although Li ''et al.'' (2010) included three sections, their study was confined to species endemic to China.{{sfn|Li et al.|2010}}

Uses: The subgenus also contains many species grown as [[ornamentals]], such as ''[[Allium giganteum|A. giganteum]]'', ''[[Allium cristophii|A. cristophii]]'', ''[[Allium schubertii|A. schubertii]]'', ''[[Allium aflatunense|A. aflatunense]]'', ''[[Allium atropurpureum|A. atropurpureum]]'', ''[[Allium nigrum|A. nigrum]]'' and ''[[Allium karataviense|A. karataviense]]''. These species are predominantly from Southwestern and Central Asia, where they are used for both culinary and medicinal purposes. The latter usage is associated with the presence of [[cysteine]] [[sulphoxides]] and also [[radical scavenger]] activity, although many members of the subgenus possess less of these compounds and lack the distinctive taste and smell of garlic and onion, their properties appear to be associated with dithiodipyrroles and sulfur-pyridins. These substances also occur in the ornamental species, that were introduced into European and North American gardens in the early 19th century, and now are represented by an increasing number of named [[cultivars]] and [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]]. Cysteine sulphoxides are also largely responsible for the flavour and spicy taste of these species, predominantly the [[isomeric]] cysteine derivatives [[alliin]] and [[isoalliin]].{{sfn|Fritsch et al.|2006}}

==== Third evolutionary line ====

The third evolutionary line contains the most number of subgenera (seven) and also the largest subgenus of the genus ''Allium'', subgenus ''Allium'' which includes the type species of the genus, ''Allium sativum''. This subgenus also contains the majority of the species in the line. Within the lineage the phylogeny is complex. Two small subgenera ''Butomissa'' and ''Cyathophora'' form a sister clade to the remaining five subgenera, with ''Butomissa'' as the first branching group. Amongst the remaining five subgenera, ''Rhizirideum'' forms a medium-sized subgenus that is the sister to the other four larger subgenera. However, they may not be monophyletic.{{sfn|Li et al.|2010}} Of the seven subgenera, the large subgenus ''Allium'', represents the bulbous elelement.{{sfn|Fritsch et al.|2010}}

===== Subgenus ''Allium'' =====
[[File:Vitlöksblomma.JPG|thumb|150px|Type species: ''Allium sativum'']]
Subgenus ''Allium'', the youngest of the subgenera, is predominantly Mediterranean but its distribution extends east towards Central Asia. This very large subgenus is divided into 15 - 16 sections{{efn|Friesen ''et al.'' include section ''Costulatae'' within section ''Allium'', while others treat it separately}} and demonstrates two main groups. One has been referred to as ''classical'' ''Allium'' with tripartite inner filaments and only one thick storage cataphyll. The other is more diverse morphologically reflected in less closely related sections. A number of sections appear to be non-monophyletic, including ''Avulsea'', ''Pallasia'', ''Brevispatha'' and ''Kopetdagia''.{{sfn|Hirschegger et al.|2010}} It includes both ornamentals, such as ''A. sphaerocephalon'', ''A. caeruleum'', ''A. carinatum'' and ''A. flavum'' as well as food crops such as ''A. sativum'' and ''A. ampeloprasum''.

;Sections

====== Section ''Allium'' ======
This is the largest section with about 114 species, a number of which are economically important, such as ''A. sativum'' (garlic) and ''A. ampeloprasum'' (leek). This section also expresses frequent [[polyploidy]] and contains a number of species whose boundaries have been difficult to establish, notably ''A. ampeloprasum'' which includes a number of subspecies and varieties, as well as synonymous species, which have been labelled the "''A. ampeloprasum'' complex". Horticulturally, it is represented by at least four groups, including leeks, whose exact ancestry has been considered uncertain. In the molecular phylogenetic study by Hirschegger and colleagues (2010) showed section ''Allium'' to be a well supported clade with two main subclades, one of which included two smaller clades. All of the tetraploid forms of ''A. ampeloprasum'' were resolved in a single clade, and leeks appeared to be more closely allied to ''A. iranicum'' and ''A. atroviolaceum'' than ''A. ampeloprasum''. Restoration of ''A. porrum'' L. was therefore proposed for the tertraploid forms, reserving ''A. ampeloprasum'' for the forms known horticulturally as great headed garlic and ''A. ampeloprasum'' var. ''babingtonii''.{{sfn|Hirschegger et al.|2010}}

====== Section ''Codonoprasum'' ======

Section ''Codonoprason'' is strongly [[monophyletic]]{{sfn|Friesen|Fritsch|Blattner|2006}}{{sfn|Salmeri et al.|2016}} and has its [[centre of diversity]] in the [[Mediterranean]] region, particularly Greece and Turkey, but extends to other areas of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. It was originally conceived of as a separate genus, ''Codonoprasum'' by [[Heinrich Gottlieb Ludwig Reichenbach|Reichenbach]] in 1828.&lt;ref name=Alliaceae/&gt; The taxonomy of the section is complicated with inconsistent speciation. In 2005 the section was considered to consist of 58 species and 7 subspecies.{{sfn|Seregin|2005}} The section is characterised as large plants with multiflowered inflorescences, long pedicels, very long spathe valves and a cylindrical-campanulate perigon, with unequal and long-caudate spathe leaves.{{sfn|Hanelt|1996}}{{sfn|Salmeri et al.|2016}}

Historically the section has been considered to have a number of subsections. Friesen recognised 2,{{sfn|Friesen|Fritsch|Blattner|2006}} while others have described 3, ''e.g.'';{{sfn|Cesmedziev|Terzijski|1997}}
: ''Codonoprasum'' &lt;small&gt;(Rchb.) Kamelin &lt;/small&gt;
: ''Longistamineum'' &lt;small&gt;Cheshm. ex Omelczuk&lt;/small&gt;
: ''Haemoprason'' &lt;small&gt;(F. Herm.) Cheshm.&lt;/small&gt;

Many species were previously included in a grouping referred to as the ''Paniculatum'' complex. Molecular studies demonstrate the presence of two clades within the section. Clade A contains the two autumn flowering species, ''[[Allium tardans]]'' and ''[[Allium parciflorum]]'' as a subclade. Clade B contains the smaller taxa within the section.

{{main|List of Allium species}}

== Etymology ==

The name ''Allium'' is ancient, and the plant was known to both the Romans and the Greeks.{{sfn|Jay|2016}} The name is thought to be Celtic in origin, meaning "to burn", in reference to its taste and smell.{{sfn|Motta|Motta|1962}} One of the earliest uses of the name in botany, was by [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]] (1656- 1708).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3322">'''The Immanent Frame''' is a digital forum that publishes interdisciplinary perspectives on [[secularism]], [[religion]], and the [[public sphere]]. It was formed in conjunction with projects on [http://www.ssrc.org/programs/religion-and-the-public-sphere/ religion and the public sphere] at the [[Social Science Research Council]] (SSRC).  Initially conceived as an experimental blog that invited multiple contributions from a number of leading scholars in the humanities and social sciences, The Immanent Frame was launched in October 2007 by an SSRC team led by program director [http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/author/vanantwerpen/ Jonathan VanAntwerpen], who served for several years as editor-in-chief.

Among other topics, The Immanent Frame launched with an extensive discussion of [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]'s ''[[A Secular Age]]'' ([[Harvard University Press]], 2007). Sociologist [[Robert Bellah]] called ''A Secular Age'' "one of the most important books to be written in my lifetime."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssrc.org/blogs/immanent_frame/2007/10/19/secularism-of-a-new-kind/ The Immanent Frame: Secularism of a new kind]&lt;/ref&gt; The Immanent Frame's discussion of Taylor's book included original contributions by [[Robert Bellah]], [[Wendy Brown (political scientist)|Wendy Brown]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], and several others. The name of the digital forum itself alludes to a central concept in Taylor's book.

Additional contributors to The Immanent Frame have included: [[Arjun Appadurai]], [[Talal Asad]], [[Rajeev Bhargava]], [[Akeel Bilgrami]], José Casanova, [[Craig Calhoun]], [[Dipesh Chakrabarty]], [[William E. Connolly]], [[Veena Das]], [[Hent de Vries]], [[Wendy Doniger]], [[Simon During]], [[John Esposito]], [[Nilüfer Göle]], [[David Hollinger]], [[Mark Juergensmeyer]], [[Mark Lilla]], Kathryn Lofton, [[Tanya Luhrmann]], [[Saba Mahmood]], [[Martin E. Marty]], [[Tomoko Masuzawa]], [[Russell T. McCutcheon]], [[Birgit Meyer]], [[John Milbank]], John Lardas Modern, [[Tariq Modood]], Jean-Claude Monod, [[Ebrahim Moosa]], [[Samuel Moyn]], [[Robert Orsi]], [[Ann Pellegrini]], [[Elizabeth Povinelli]], [[Vijay Prashad]], [[Robert D.

Taylor]], [[Peter van der Veer]], [[Michael Warner]], [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]], [[Molly Worthen]], and many others.

In 2016, The Immanent Frame established its first editorial board. Board members include sociologist Courtney Bender, political scientist Elizabeth Shakman Hurd, and anthropologist [[Saba Mahmood]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/2016/03/14/new-editorial-board/ The Immanent Frame: New editorial board]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4360">In [[philosophy]], '''truth by consensus''' is the process of taking statements to be true simply because people generally agree upon them.  [[Imre Lakatos]] characterizes it as a "watered down" form of provable [[truth]] propounded by some [[sociology of knowledge|sociologists of knowledge]], particularly [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Michael Polanyi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophical Papers|author=[[Imre Lakatos]]|chapter=Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes|pages=8|year=1978|publisher=Cambridge University Press|chapter-url=http://www.csun.edu/~vcsoc00i/classes/s680f11/Lakatos.pdf|isbn=978-0-521-28031-0|access-date=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Nigel Warburton]] argues that the truth by consensus process is not a reliable way of discovering truth.  That there is general agreement upon something does not make it actually true.&lt;br&gt;
There are two main reasons for this:&lt;ref name=Warburton&gt;{{cite book|title=Thinking from A to Z|author=Nigel Warburton|chapter=truth by consensus|pages=134&amp;ndash;135|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-22281-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# One reason Warburton discusses is that people are prone to wishful thinking.  People can believe an assertion and espouse it as truth in the face of overwhelming evidence and facts to the contrary, simply because they wish that things were so.  
# The other one is that people are gullible, and easily misled.

Another unreliable method of determining truth is by determining the majority opinion of a popular vote.  This is unreliable because on many questions the majority of people are ill-informed.  Warburton gives [[astrology]] as an example of this.  He states that while it may be the case that the majority of the people of the world believe that people's destinies are wholly determined by astrological mechanisms, given that most of that majority have only sketchy and superficial knowledge of the stars in the first place, their views cannot be held to be a significant factor in determining the truth of astrology.  The fact that something "is generally agreed" or that "most people believe" something should be viewed critically, asking the question why that factor is considered to matter at all in an argument over truth.  He states that the simple fact that a majority believes something to be true is unsatisfactory justification for believing it to be true.&lt;ref name=Warburton /&gt;

Warburton makes a distinction between the fallacy of truth by consensus and the process of [[democracy]] in decision-making.  Democracy is preferable to other processes not because it results in truth, but because it provides for equal participation by multiple special-interest groups, and the avoidance of [[tyranny]].&lt;ref name=Warburton /&gt;

Weinberger characterizes [[Jürgen Habermas]] as a proponent of a [[consensus theory of truth]], and criticizes that theory as unacceptable on the following grounds:  First, even if everyone's opinion is in agreement, those opinions may all nonetheless be erroneous.  Second, truth by consensus is conceived as a limit that is approached via an idealized process of discourse; however, it has not been proven that discourse even tends towards such a limit, or that discourse even tends towards ''one single'' limit, and thus it is not proven that truth is the limit that is approached by ideal discourse and consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alternative Action Theory: Simultaneously a Critique of Georg Henrik Von Wright's Practical Philosophy|author=Ota Weinberger|pages=63|year=1998|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-7923-5184-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rabbit-erosion.jpg|thumb|An [[erosion|erosion gully]] in Australia caused by rabbits. The release of [[rabbits in Australia]] for hunting purposes has had serious unintended ecological consequences.]]
In the [[social sciences]], '''unintended consequences''' (sometimes '''unanticipated consequences''' or '''unforeseen consequences''') are outcomes that are not the ones foreseen and intended by a purposeful action. The term was popularised in the twentieth century by American [[sociologist]] [[Robert K. Merton]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/24/nyregion/robert-k-merton-versatile-sociologist-and-father-of-the-focus-group-dies-at-92.html Robert K. Merton, Versatile Sociologist and Father of the Focus Group, Dies at 92], Michael T. Kaufman, ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Unintended consequences can be grouped into three types:
* ''Unexpected benefit'':  A positive unexpected benefit (also referred to as [[luck]], [[serendipity]] or a [[wikt:windfall|windfall]]).
* ''Unexpected drawback'':  An unexpected detriment occurring in addition to the desired effect of the policy (e.g., while [[irrigation]] schemes provide people with water for agriculture, they can increase [[waterborne diseases]] that have devastating health effects, such as [[schistosomiasis]]).
* ''Perverse result'': A perverse effect contrary to what was originally intended (when an intended solution makes a problem worse). This is sometimes referred to as 'backfire'.

==History==
===John Locke===
The idea of ''unintended consequences'' dates back at least to [[John Locke]] who discussed the unintended consequences of [[interest rate]] [[regulation]] in his letter to Sir John Somers, Member of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;John Locke, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/763#lf0128-04_head_002''The Works of John Locke in Nine Volumes''], (London: Rivington, 1824 12th ed.). Vol. 4. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Adam Smith===
The idea was also discussed by [[Adam Smith]], the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], and [[consequentialism]] (judging by results).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Adam|title=The Theory of Moral Sentiments|page=93|url=http://metalibri.wikidot.com/title:theory-of-moral-sentiments:smith-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robert K. Merton===
Sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] popularised this concept in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renowned Columbia Sociologist and National Medal of Science Winner Robert K. Merton Dies at 92|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/03/02/robertKMerton.html|publisher=Columbia News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/mar03/indextwo.html Robert K. Merton Remembered] Footnotes, American Sociological Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Merton/&gt;

In "The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action" (1936), Merton tried to apply a systematic analysis to the problem of unintended consequences of deliberate acts intended to cause [[social change]]. He emphasized that his term ''purposive action'', "[was exclusively] concerned with 'conduct' as distinct from 'behavior.' That is, with action that involves motives and consequently a choice between various alternatives".&lt;ref name=Merton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|title=The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=1|issue=6|page=895|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/4111/2111-home/CD/TheoryClass/Readings/MertonSocialAction.pdf|accessdate=2008-05-30|doi=10.2307/2084615|jstor=2084615|year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merton's usage included deviations from what [[Max Weber]] defined as rational social action: instrumentally rational and value rational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Max|title=Economy and Society|publisher=University of California Press|date=1978|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merton also stated that "no blanket statement categorically affirming or denying the practical feasibility of ''all'' social planning is warranted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|title=The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=1|issue=6|page=904|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/4111/2111-home/CD/TheoryClass/Readings/MertonSocialAction.pdf|accessdate=2008-05-30|doi=10.2307/2084615|jstor=2084615|year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everyday usage===
More recently, the ''law of unintended consequences'' has come to be used as an adage or idiomatic warning that an intervention in a [[complex system]] tends to create unanticipated and often undesirable outcomes.&lt;ref name="Norton "&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Norton |first=Rob |editor=[[David R. Henderson]] |encyclopedia=[[Concise Encyclopedia of Economics]] |title=Unintended Consequences |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/UnintendedConsequences.html  |year=2008 |edition= 2nd |publisher=[[Library of Economics and Liberty]] |location=Indianapolis |isbn=978-0865976658 |oclc=237794267}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/mislj71&amp;div=24&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=HeinOnline |publisher=HeinOnline |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/flsulr28&amp;div=36&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=28 Florida State University Law Review 2000–2001 Mandatory Minimum Sentences: Exemplifying the Law of Unintended Consequences Comment |publisher=Heinonline.org |date=1993-06-18 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/antil65&amp;div=47&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=HeinOnline |publisher=HeinOnline |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akin to [[Murphy's law]], it is commonly used as a wry or humorous warning against the [[hubris]]tic belief that humans can fully control the world around them.

==Causes==
Possible causes of unintended consequences include the world's inherent [[complexity]] (parts of a system responding to changes in the environment), [[perverse incentive]]s, human [[stupidity]], [[self-deception]], failure to account for human nature, or other [[cognitive bias|cognitive]] or [[emotional bias|emotional]] biases. As a sub-component of complexity (in the scientific sense), the chaotic nature of the universe—and especially its quality of having small, apparently insignificant changes with far-reaching effects (e.g., the [[butterfly effect]])—applies.

[[Robert K. Merton]] listed five possible causes of unanticipated consequences in 1936:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Merton, Robert K|title=On Social Structure and Science|publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]]|year=1996|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/O/bo3626245.html|accessdate=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Ignorance, making it  impossible to anticipate everything, thereby leading to incomplete analysis.
# Errors in analysis of the problem or following habits that worked in the past but may not apply to the current situation.
# Immediate interests overriding long-term interests.
# Basic values which may require or prohibit certain actions even if the long-term result might be unfavourable (these long-term consequences may eventually cause changes in basic values).
# [[Self-defeating prophecy]], or, the fear of some consequence which drives people to find solutions before the problem occurs, thus the non-occurrence of the problem is not anticipated.

In addition to Merton's causes, psychologist Stuart Vyse has noted that [[groupthink]], described by [[Irving Janis]], has been blamed for some decisions that result in unintended consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vyse |first1=Stuart |title=Can Anything Save Us from Unintended Consequences? |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=20-23 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919223200/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/can_anything_save_us_from_unintended_consequences |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sinking of ships in shallow waters during wartime has created many artificial [[coral reefs]], which can be scientifically valuable and have become an attraction for recreational divers.

In [[medicine]], most [[Medication|drugs]] have unintended consequences ('[[side effect]]s') associated with their use. However, some are beneficial. For instance, [[aspirin]], a [[pain reliever]], is also an [[anticoagulant]] that can help prevent [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] and reduce the severity and damage from [[thrombotic stroke]]s.&lt;ref name=BBC15Feb2001&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1168850.stm |title=BBC 15 February 2001, ''Aspirin heart warning'' |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-02-15 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of beneficial [[side effect]]s also leads to [[off-label use]]—prescription or use of a drug for an unlicensed purpose. Famously, the drug [[Viagra]] was developed to lower blood pressure, with its use for treating [[erectile dysfunction]] being discovered as a side effect in clinical trials.

The objective of microfinance initiatives is to foster micro-entrepreneurs but an unintended consequence can be informal intermediation: That is, some entrepreneurial borrowers become informal intermediaries between microfinance initiatives and poorer micro-entrepreneurs. Those who more easily qualify for microfinance split loans into smaller credit to poorer borrowers. Informal intermediation ranges from casual intermediaries at the good or benign end of the spectrum to 'loan sharks' at the professional and sometimes criminal end of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arp|first=Frithjof|last2=Ardisa|first2=Alvin|last3=Ardisa|first3=Alviani|date=2017|title=Microfinance for poverty alleviation: Do transnational initiatives overlook fundamental questions of competition and intermediation?|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320100413_Microfinance_for_poverty_alleviation_Do_transnational_initiatives_overlook_fundamental_questions_of_competition_and_intermediation|journal=Transnational Corporations|volume=24|issue=3|pages=103–117|publisher=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|id=UNCTAD/DIAE/IA/2017D4A8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the Australian state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] made [[bicycle helmet|safety helmets]] mandatory for all bicycle riders. While there was a reduction in the number of head injuries, there was also an unintended reduction in the number of juvenile cyclists—fewer cyclists obviously leads to fewer injuries, assuming [[Ceteris paribus|all else being equal]]. The risk of death and serious injury per cyclist seems to have increased, possibly due to [[risk compensation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyclehelmets.org/1241.html |title=Evaluating Head Injuries and Helmet Laws in Australia and New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Vulcan, ''et al.'' found that the reduction in juvenile cyclists was because the youths considered wearing a bicycle helmet unfashionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cameron |first1=Maxwell H. |last2=Vulcan |first2=A.

[[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition in the 1920s United States]], originally enacted to suppress the alcohol trade, drove many small-time alcohol suppliers out of business and consolidated the hold of large-scale [[organized crime]] over the illegal alcohol industry. Since alcohol was still popular, criminal organisations producing alcohol were well-funded and hence also increased their other activities. Similarly, the [[War on Drugs]], intended to suppress the [[illegal drug trade]], instead increased the power and profitability of drug cartels who became the primary source of the products.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Forero, "Colombia's Coca Survives U.S. plan to uproot it", The New York Times, August 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Don Podesta and Douglas Farah, "Drug Policy in Andes Called Failure," ''[[Washington Post]]'', March 27, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="streatfeild"&gt;{{cite web |author=Dominic Streatfeild |title=Source Material for ''Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography'': Interview between Milton Friedman and Dominic Streatfeild |date=June 2000 |url=http://www.dominicstreatfeild.com/2010/11/08/interview-with-milton-friedman/ |publisher=Dominicstratfeild |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113201345/http://www.dominicstreatfeild.com/2010/11/08/interview-with-milton-friedman/ |archivedate=2012-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An open letter |url=http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/endorsers.html |publisher=Prohibition Costs |accessdate=2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passenger-side [[airbag]]s in motorcars were intended as a safety feature, but led to an increase in child fatalities in the mid-1990s as small children were being hit by deploying airbags during collisions. The supposed solution to this problem, moving the child seat to the back of the vehicle, led to an increase in the number of children forgotten in unattended vehicles, some of whom died under extreme temperature conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://time.com/hot-car-death/ |work=Time |first1=Justin |last1=Worland/Ridgefield |title=Who's To Blame For Hot Car Deaths? |date=2014-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risk compensation, or the [[Risk compensation|Peltzman effect]], occurs after implementation of safety measures intended to reduce injury or death (e.g. bike helmets, seatbelts, etc.). People may feel safer than they really are and take additional risks which they would not have taken without the safety measures in place. This may result in no change, or even an increase, in morbidity or mortality, rather than a decrease as intended.

The British government, concerned about the number of venomous cobra snakes in Delhi, [[Cobra effect|offered a bounty for every dead cobra]]. This was a successful strategy as large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, enterprising people began breeding cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, they scrapped the reward program, causing the cobra breeders to set the now-worthless snakes free. As a result, the wild cobra population further increased. The apparent solution for the problem made the situation even worse, becoming known as the [[Cobra effect]].

[[Theobald Mathew (temperance reformer)|Theobald Mathew]]'s temperance campaign in 19th-century [[Ireland]] resulted in thousands of people vowing never to drink [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] again.

Beginning in the 1940s and continuing into the 1960s, the Canadian federal government gave the Catholic Church in Quebec $2.25 per day per psychiatric patient for their cost of care, but only $0.75 a day per orphan. The perverse result is that the orphan children were diagnosed as mentally ill so the church could receive the larger amount of money. This psychiatric misdiagnosis affected up to 20,000 people, and the children are known as the [[Duplessis Orphans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1WNWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EvIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6929%2C5814760 |title=The Spokesman-Review  |work=google.com |accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DeceAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WHsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6753%2C1774080 |title=Sarasota Herald-Tribune  |work=google.com |accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lT9TAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A4UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6732%2C2759782 |title=The Prescott Courier |work=google.com |accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing usage of [[search engine]]s, also including recent [[Image retrieval|image search]] features, has contributed in the ease of which media is consumed. Some [[Abnormal psychology|abnormalities]] in usage may have shifted preferences for pornographic film actors, as the producers began using [[search engine optimization|common search queries or tags]] to label the actors in new roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Kline| first = Matthew| title = How SEO has changed the porn industry| work = Mashable| accessdate = 2017-08-12| url = http://mashable.com/2017/08/11/seo-of-porn/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage of the [[Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act]] has led to a reported increase in risky behaviors by sex workers as a result of quashing their ability to seek and screen clients online, forcing them back onto the streets or into the [[dark web]].  The ads posted were previously an avenue for advocates to reach out to those wanting to escape the trade.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/sesta-fosta-forces-sex-trafficking-victims-streets-dark-web-w520720&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental intervention==

Most modern technologies have negative consequences that are both unavoidable and unpredictable. For example, almost all [[environmental problem]]s, from chemical [[pollution]] to [[global warming]], are the unexpected consequences of the application of modern technologies. [[Traffic congestion]], deaths and injuries from car accidents, [[air pollution]], and global warming are unintended consequences of the invention and large scale adoption of the [[automobile]]. [[Hospital infection]]s are the unexpected side-effect of [[antibiotic resistance]], and even [[human overpopulation]] is the side effect of various technological (i.e., [[Agricultural revolution (disambiguation)|agricultural]] and [[industrial revolution|industrial]]) revolutions.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|author1=Huesemann, Michael H.|author2=Joyce A. Huesemann|year=2011|url=http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org|title=Technofix: Why Technology Won't Save Us or the Environment|chapter=Chapter 1, "The Inherent Unavoidability and Unpredictability of Unintended Consequences", and Chapter 2, "Some Unintended Consequences of Modern Technology"|publisher=New Society Publishers|location=Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada|isbn=0865717044|pp=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the complexity of [[ecosystems]], deliberate changes to an ecosystem or other environmental interventions will often have (usually negative) unintended consequences. Sometimes, these effects cause permanent [[irreversible change]]s. Examples include:
* During the [[Four Pests Campaign]] a killing of sparrows was declared. Chinese leaders later realized that sparrows ate a large amount of insects, as well as grains. Rather than being increased, rice yields after the campaign were substantially decreased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Frank|last= Dikotter|title=Mao's Great Famine|location=New York|publisher=Walker &amp; Co.|year=2010|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the [[Great Plague of London]] a killing of dogs and cats was ordered. If left untouched, they would have made a significant reduction in the rat population that carried the fleas which transmitted the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Moote, Lloyd and Dorothy: ''The Great Plague: the Story of London's most Deadly Year'', Baltimore, 2004. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The installation of [[smokestack]]s to decrease pollution in local areas, resulting in spread of pollution at a higher altitude, and [[acid rain]] on an international scale.&lt;ref name="Likens, G.

* After about 1900, public demand led the US government to fight [[forest fire]]s in the American West, and set aside land as national forests and parks to protect them from fires. This policy led to fewer fires, but also led to growth conditions such that, when fires did occur, they were much larger and more damaging. Modern research suggests that this policy was misguided, and that a certain level of wildfires is a natural and important part of [[forest ecology]].&lt;ref name="How The Smokey Bear Effect Led To Raging Wildfires"&gt;{{cite web|last=Joyce|first=Christopher|title=How The Smokey Bear Effect Led To Raging Wildfires|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/08/23/159373691/how-the-smokey-bear-effect-led-to-raging-wildfires|work=npr.org|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vacuolar pathway:'''
Movement of water molecules in [[plant cell]]s via the [[vacuoles]] located in the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell. The water molecules encounter high resistance however and as a result little flow usually occurs making this pathway insignificant, the [[Apoplast|Apoplast pathway]] and [[Symplast|Symplast pathway]] being the major pathways for movement of water in plants.
Water moves by osmosis across the vacuoles of the cells of the root system. The water moves down a concentration gradient from the soil solution to the xylem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2996">[[File:Western palearctic.png|thumb|Boundaries in ''Birds of the Western Palearctic'']]

The '''Western Palaearctic''' or '''Western Palearctic''' is part of the [[Palaearctic ecozone]], one of the eight [[ecozone]]s dividing the Earth's surface. Because of its size, the Palaearctic is often divided for convenience into two, with Europe, North Africa, northern and central parts of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and part of temperate Asia, roughly to the [[Ural Mountains]] forming the western zone, and the rest of temperate Asia becoming the Eastern Palaearctic. Its exact boundaries differ depending on the authority in question, but the  ''Handbook of the Birds of Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa: The Birds of the Western Palearctic)'' (''BWP'') definition is widely  used, and is followed by the most popular Western Palearctic checklist, that of the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC). The Western Palearctic ecozone includes mostly [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] and [[temperate]] climate ecoregions.&lt;ref name=BWP&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Snow |editor-first=David |editor2=Perrins, Christopher M | title = The Birds of the Western Palearctic concise edition (2 volumes) | publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 1998| location =Oxford | isbn = 019854099X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palaearctic region has been recognised as a natural zoogeographic region since [[Philip Sclater|Sclater]] proposed it in 1858. The oceans to the north and west, and the [[Sahara]] to the south are obvious natural boundaries with other ecozones, but the eastern boundary is more arbitrary, since it merges into another part of the same ecozone, and the mountain ranges used as markers are less effective [[biogeography|biogeographic]] separators.&lt;ref name= jas&gt;{{cite journal | last= Masseti | first= Marco |author2=Bruner, Emiliano  | year=2009 |title=  The primates of the western Palaearctic: a biogeographical, historical, and archaeozoological review | journal= [[Journal of Anthropological Sciences]] | volume= 87 |language = | issue =  | pages= 33–91 | url =http://www.isita-org.com/jass/Contents/2009%20vol87/PDF/On-Line_bassa/JASs2009_03_Masseti.pdf |format = | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The climate differences across the Western Palearctic region can cause behavioral differences within the same species across geographical distance, such as in the sociality of behavior for bees of the species ''[[Lasioglossum malachurum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evidence for geographic variation in colony social organization in an obligately social sweat bee, Lasioglossum malachurum Kirby (Hymenoptera; Halictidae)|url = http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/z00-064|journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology|pages = 1259–1266|volume = 78|issue = 7|doi = 10.1139/z00-064|first = Miriam H|last = Richards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ZipcodeZoo''' is a free, online encyclopedia intended to document all living [[species]] and [[infraspecies]] known to science. It is compiled from existing databases. It offers one page for each living species, supplementing text with video, sound, and images where available.

ZipcodeZoo is an online [[database]] that collects the [[natural history]], [[Biological classification|classification]], [[species]] characteristics, [[conservation biology]], and [[Range (biology)|distribution]] [[information]] of thousands of species and [[infraspecies]].  It includes over 800,000 [[photographs]], 50,000 [[video]]s, 160,000 [[media clip|sound clip]]s, and 3.2 million [[map]]s describing nearly 3.2 million species and infraspecies.

The site and its sister site lookup.life include a number of specialized search functions, such as identifying a bird species from its color, shape and other traits, including where it was seen; or generating a list of plants or animals likely to be found in or near a specific location (a zipcode, state, country, latitude/longitude, etc.). The searches can be restricted to specific taxa, or broad categories like reptiles or fish. A sound trainer can play multiple bird song recordings simultaneously.

ZipcodeZoo draws on the [[Catalogue of Life]] for its basic species list, the [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]] for its maps, [[Flickr]] for many of its photos, [[YouTube]] for videos, [[Xeno-canto]] for some of its sound recordings, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] for conservation status, and other major sources.&lt;ref&gt;such as the [http://taxonomicon.taxonomy.nl/ Taxonomicon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824160507/http://taxonomicon.taxonomy.nl/ |date=August 24, 2009 }} for taxonomic information.&lt;/ref&gt;
