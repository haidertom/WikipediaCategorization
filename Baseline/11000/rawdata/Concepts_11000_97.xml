'''Angle of loll''' is the state of a ship that is  [[Ship stability|unstable]] when upright (i.e. has a negative [[metacentric height]]) and therefore takes on an angle of heel to either [[port (nautical)|port]] or [[starboard]].

When a vessel has negative metacentric height (GM) ''i.e.'', is in unstable equilibrium, any external force applied to the vessel will cause it to start heeling. As it heels, the [[second moment of area|moment of inertia]] of the vessel's [[waterline|waterplane]] (a plane intersecting the hull at the water's surface) increases, which increases the vessel's BM (distance from the [[center of buoyancy|center of ''B''uoyancy]] to the ''M''etacenter). Since there is relatively little change in KB (distance from the ''K''eel to the center of ''B''uoyancy) of the vessel, the KM (distance from ''K''eel to the ''M''etacenter) of the vessel increases.

At some angle of heel (say 10Â°), KM will increase sufficiently equal to KG (distance from the keel to the center of gravity), thus making GM of vessel equal to zero. When this occurs, the vessel goes to neutral equilibrium, and the angle of heel at which it happens is called ''angle of loll''.
In other words, when an unstable vessel heels over towards a progressively increasing angle of heel, at a certain angle of heel, the center of buoyancy (B) may fall vertically below the center of gravity (G). Angle of [[list (watercraft)|list]] should not be confused with angle of loll. Angle of list is caused by unequal loading on either side of center line of vessel.

Although a vessel at angle of loll does display features of stable equilibrium, this is a dangerous situation and rapid remedial action is required to prevent the vessel from capsizing.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, "The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea", 1976, p. 494&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Stability Calculations - Estimating Center of Gravity  | publisher=Maritime &amp; Coastguard Agency| url=http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga-safety_information/mcga-safety_alerts-tech/ssb_safety_alert-2.htm | accessdate=2007-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Definition - angle of loll | publisher=Maritime Dictionary | date= | url=http://www.m-i-link.com/dictionary/default.asp?term=angle+of+loll | accessdate=2007-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stability Definitions |publisher=MCA Orals |url=http://www.mcaorals.co.uk/Stability%20Definations.htm |accessdate=2007-01-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126025324/http://www.mcaorals.co.uk/Stability%20Definations.htm |archivedate=26 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

It is often caused by the influence of a large [[free surface]] or the loss of stability due to damaged compartments.  It is different from [[list (watercraft)|list]] in that the vessel is not induced to heel to one side or the other by the distribution of weight, it is merely incapable of maintaining a zero heel attitude.

[[File:Arthur Oncken Lovejoy.jpg|thumb|right|Arthur Oncken Lovejoy, historian and philosopher]]
'''Arthur Oncken Lovejoy''' (October 10, 1873 &amp;ndash; December 30, 1962) was an [[United States|American]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[intellectual history|intellectual historian]], who founded the discipline known as the [[history of ideas]] with his book ''The Great Chain of Being'' (1936), on the [[Great chain of being|topic of that name]], which is regarded as 'probably the single most influential work in the history of ideas in the United States during the last half century'.&lt;ref name="Knuuttila" &gt;Simo Knuuttila (ed.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8B8yBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3  ''Reforging the Great Chain of Being: Studies of the History of Modal Theories,''] Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2013 p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Lovejoy was born in [[Berlin]], [[German Empire|Germany]] while his father was doing medical research there. Eighteen months later, his mother committed suicide, whereupon his father gave up medicine and became a clergyman. Lovejoy studied [[philosophy]], first at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] at [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], then at [[Harvard]]&lt;ref name="DictPR"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33983842|title=Dictionary of philosophy and religion: Eastern and Western thought|last=Reese|first=William|date=1996|publisher=Humanities Press|isbn=0391038648|location=Atlantic Highlands, N.J.|oclc=33983842|page=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; under [[William James]] and [[Josiah Royce]]. In 1901, he resigned from his first job, at [[Stanford University]], to protest the dismissal of a colleague who had offended a trustee. The President of Harvard then vetoed hiring Lovejoy on the grounds that he was a known troublemaker. Over the subsequent decade, he taught at [[Washington University]], [[Columbia University]], and the [[University of Missouri]]. He never married.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

As a professor of philosophy at [[Johns Hopkins University]] from 1910 to 1938, Lovejoy founded and long presided over that university's History of Ideas Club, where many prominent and budding intellectual and social historians, as well as [[literary critic]]s, gathered. In 1940 he founded the ''[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]''. Lovejoy insisted that the history of ideas should focus on "unit ideas," single concepts (namely simple concepts sharing an abstract name with other concepts that were to be conceptually distinguished). Abstract nouns like 'pragmatism' 'idealism', 'rationalism' and the like were, in Lovejoy's view, constituted by distinct, analytically separate ideas, which the historian of the genealogy of ideas had to thresh out, and show how the basic unit ideas combine and recombine with each other over time.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur O. Lovejoy, [''The Great Chain of Being,''] (1936) Harper &amp; Row 1960 pp.5ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea has, according to Simo Knuuttila, exercised a greater attraction on literary critics than on philosophers.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

Lovejoy was active in the public arena. He helped found the [[American Association of University Professors]] and the [[Maryland]] chapter of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].  However, he qualified his belief in [[civil liberties]] to exclude what he considered threats to a free system. Thus, at the height of the [[McCarthy Era]] (in the February 14, 1952 edition of the ''Journal of Philosophy'') Lovejoy stated that, since it was a "matter of empirical fact" that membership in the [[Communist Party]] contributed "to the triumph of a world-wide organization" which was opposed to "freedom of inquiry, of opinion and of teaching," membership in the party constituted grounds for dismissal from academic positions. He also published numerous opinion pieces in the Baltimore press. He died in [[Baltimore]] on December 30, 1962.

==Scholarship==
In the domain of [[epistemology]], Lovejoy is remembered for an influential critique of the pragmatic movement, especially in the essay "The Thirteen Pragmatisms", written in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=0ATV5bb3ZsQC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;dq=Arthur+Lovejoy+%22Thirteen+Pragmatisms%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y5fb_zAjG_&amp;sig=yTplB16a_MPxBvqvJPvEPanm8AA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9g5dSpCLBYvysgOW7ZCvCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4 The Thirteen Pragmatisms], The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Methods, now''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]'', Part I, 2 January 1908 p. 5-12.  Part II, 16 January 1908, p. 29-39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. F. Bynum|William F. Bynum]], looking back at Lovejoy's ''Great Chain of Being'' after 40 years, describes it as "a familiar feature of the intellectual landscape", indicating its great influence and "brisk" ongoing sales. Bynum argues that much more research is needed into how the concept of the great chain of being was replaced, but he agrees that Lovejoy was right that the crucial period was the end of the 18th century when "the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s chain of being was dismantled".&lt;ref&gt;William F. Bynum: [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1975HisSc..13....1B&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf "The Great Chain of Being after Forty Years: An Appraisal"], ''History of Science'' 13 (1975): 1-28&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[aeronautics]], the '''aspect ratio''' of a [[wing]] is the ratio of its [[Wingspan|span]] to its mean [[chord (aircraft)|chord]]. It is equal to the square of the wingspan divided by the wing area. Thus, a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio, whereas a short, wide wing has a low aspect ratio.&lt;ref name="Kermode"&gt;Kermode, A.C. (1972), ''Mechanics of Flight'', Chapter 3, (p.103, eighth edition), Pitman Publishing Limited, London {{ISBN|0-273-31623-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspect ratio and other features of the [[Planform (aeronautics)|planform]] are often used to predict the aerodynamic efficiency of a wing because the [[lift-to-drag ratio]] increases with aspect ratio, improving [[fuel economy in aircraft]].

== Mechanism ==
Roughly speaking, an airplane in flight can be imagined to affect a circular cylinder of air with a diameter equal to the wingspan.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', section 5.15&lt;/ref&gt; A large wingspan affects a large cylinder of air, and a small wingspan affects a small cylinder of air. A small air cylinder must be pushed down with a greater power (energy change per unit time) than a large cylinder in order to produce an equal upward force (momentum change per unit time). This is because giving the same momentum change to a smaller mass of air requires giving it a greater velocity change, and a much greater energy change because energy is proportional to the square of the velocity while momentum is only linearly proportional to the velocity. The aft-leaning component of this change in velocity is proportional to the [[lift-induced drag|induced drag]], which is the force needed to take up that power at that airspeed.  

The interaction between undisturbed air outside the cylinder of air, and the downward-moving cylinder of air occurs at the wingtips and can be seen as [[wingtip vortices]].

It is important to keep in mind that this is a drastic oversimplification, and an airplane wing affects a very large area around itself.&lt;ref&gt;McLean, Doug, ''Understanding Aerodynamics: Arguing from the Real Physics'', section 3.3.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a long, narrow wing with a high aspect ratio has aerodynamic advantages like better lift-to-drag-ratio (see also details below), there are several reasons why not ''all'' aircraft have high aspect wings:

* '''Structural''': A long wing has higher [[Torque|bending stress]] for a given load than a short one and therefore requires higher structural-design (architectural and/or material) specifications.  Also, longer wings may have some torsion for a given load, and in some applications this torsion is undesirable (e.g. if the warped wing interferes with [[aileron]] effect).
* '''Maneuverability''': a low aspect-ratio wing will have a higher [[Aircraft principal axes|roll]] angular acceleration  than one of high aspect ratio, because a high-aspect-ratio wing has a higher moment of inertia to overcome. In a steady roll, the longer wing gives a higher roll moment because of the longer moment arm of the aileron. Low  aspect ratio wings are usually used on [[fighter aircraft]], not only for the higher roll rates, but especially for longer chord and thinner airfoils involved in supersonic flight.
* '''Parasitic drag''':  While high aspect wings create less induced drag, they have greater [[parasitic drag]], (drag due to shape, frontal area, and surface friction).  This is because, for an equal wing ''area'', the average chord (length in the direction of wind travel over the wing) is smaller.  Due to the effects of [[Reynolds number]], the value of the section drag coefficient is an inverse logarithmic function of the characteristic length of the surface, which means that, even if two wings of the same area are flying at equal speeds and equal angles of attack, the section drag coefficient is slightly higher on the wing with the smaller chord.  However, this variation is very small when compared to the variation in induced drag with changing wingspan.&lt;br /&gt;For example,&lt;ref&gt;Dommasch, D.O., Sherby, S.S., and Connolly, T.F. (1961), ''Airplane Aerodynamics'', page 128, Pitman Publishing Corp. New York&lt;/ref&gt; the section drag coefficient &lt;math&gt;c_d\;&lt;/math&gt; of a [[NACA]] 23012 airfoil (at typical lift coefficients) is inversely proportional to chord length to the power 0.129: &lt;br /&gt;{{pad|2em}} &lt;math&gt;c_d \varpropto \frac{1}{(\text{chord})^{0.129}}.&lt;/math&gt; 
:A 20% increase in chord length would decrease the section drag coefficient by 2.38%.

* '''Practicality''':  low aspect ratios have a greater useful internal volume, since the maximum thickness is greater, which can be used to house the fuel tanks, retractable [[landing gear]] and other systems.
* '''Airfield Size''': Airfields, hangars and other ground equipment define a maximum wingspan, which cannot be exceeded, and to generate enough lift at the given wingspan, the aircraft designer has to lower the aspect-ratio and increase the total wing area. This limits the [[Airbus A380]] to 80m wide with an aspect ratio of 7.8, while the [[Boeing 787]] or [[Airbus A350]] have an aspect ratio of 9.5, influencing flight economy.&lt;ref name=leeUp&gt;Hamilton, Scott.

===Variable aspect ratio===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
Aircraft which approach or exceed the speed of sound sometimes incorporate [[variable-sweep wing]]s. These wings give a high aspect ratio when unswept and a low aspect ratio at maximum sweep.

In subsonic flow, steeply swept and narrow wings are inefficient compared to a high-aspect-ratio wing. However, as the flow becomes transonic and then supersonic, the [[shock wave]] first generated along the wing's upper surface causes [[wave drag]] on the aircraft, and this drag is proportional to the span of the wing. Thus a long span, valuable at low speeds, causes excessive drag at transonic and supersonic speeds.

By varying the sweep the wing can be optimised for the current flight speed. However the extra weight and complexity of a moveable wing mean that it is not often used.

==Birds and bats==
{{See also|Bird flight|Bat flight}}
The aspect ratios of birds' and bats' wings vary considerably.  Birds that fly long distances or spend long periods soaring such as [[albatross]]es and [[eagle]]s often have wings of high aspect ratio. By contrast, birds which require good maneuverability, such as the [[Eurasian sparrowhawk]], have wings of low aspect ratio.

==Details==
For a constant-chord wing of chord ''c'' and span ''b'', the aspect ratio is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;AR = {b\over c}&lt;/math&gt;

If the wing is swept, ''c'' is measured parallel to the direction of forward flight.

For most wings the length of the chord is not a constant but varies along the wing, so the aspect ratio ''AR'' is defined as the square of the [[wingspan]] ''b'' divided by the wing area ''S''.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John D. Jr, ''Introduction to Flight'', Equation 5.26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', sub-section 5.13(f)&lt;/ref&gt; In symbols,
:&lt;math&gt;AR = {b^2 \over S}&lt;/math&gt;.

For such a wing with varying chord, the [[Chord (aeronautics)#Standard mean chord|standard mean chord]] ''SMC'' is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;SMC = {S\over b} = {b\over AR}&lt;/math&gt;

The performance of aspect ratio AR  related to the lift-to-drag-ratio and wingtip vortices is illustrated in the formula used to calculate the drag coefficient of an aircraft &lt;math&gt;C_d\;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John D. Jr, ''Introduction to Flight'', section 5.14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', sub-equation 5.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John D. Jr, ''Fundamentals of Aerodynamics'', Equation 5.63 (4th edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wetted aspect ratio===
The '''wetted aspect ratio''' considers the whole wetted surface area of the airframe, &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt;, rather than just the wing. It is a better measure of the aerodynamic efficiency of an aircraft than the [[aspect ratio (wing)|wing aspect ratio]]. It is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{AR}_{\mathrm{wet}} = {b^2 \over S_w}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is span and &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wetted surface]].

Illustrative examples are provided by the [[Boeing B-47]] and [[Avro Vulcan]]. Both aircraft have very similar performance although they are radically different. The B-47 has a high aspect ratio wing, while the Avro Vulcan has a low aspect ratio wing. They have, however, a very similar wetted aspect ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meridian-int-res.com/Aeronautics/Burnelli.htm |title=The Lifting Fuselage Body |publisher=Meridian-int-res.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''blue flower''' ({{lang-de|'''Blaue Blume'''}}) was a central symbol of inspiration for the [[Romanticism]] movement, and remains an enduring [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] in Western art today.&lt;ref name="BlueflowerHistory"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stands for [[Desire (emotion)|desire]], [[love]], and the metaphysical striving for the [[Infinity (philosophy)|infinite]] and unreachable. It symbolizes hope and the beauty of things.

==Early use of the symbol==
German author [[Novalis]]  used the symbol in his unfinished [[Bildungsroman]], entitled ''[[Heinrich von Ofterdingen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UwdCyBv2KCgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=novalis+Heinrich+von+Ofterdingen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis_9mhsI7YAhXMz4MKHTlYAxsQ6AEIUjAH#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Henry of Ofterdingen: a Romance, By Novalis (English Translation)]&lt;/ref&gt;After contemplating a meeting with a stranger, the young Heinrich von Ofterdingen dreams about a blue flower which calls to him and absorbs his attention.

==Explanation of the symbol==
In the book ''Heinrich von Ofterdingen'' the blue flower symbolises the joining of humanity with nature and the spirit so the understanding of nature and of the self is growing.
In the Romantic the meaning of humanity was a continuation from [[Humanism]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], but the focus was on one's own emotions, not on abstract theory.
Understanding and thinking rise in the comprehension of Romanticism from one's own individual love.
Feeling is based on the self, thinking is based on the self, and the development of the self leads and inspires the individual person. Also, contemplation is very important. Through feeling, thinking, and contemplation, personal inward cognition is possible. The process of cognition merges again with individual love. The self and nature are in this theory always linked.

==Use of the symbol==
[[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff]] wrote a poem called ''Die blaue Blume'' (The blue flower). [[Adelbert von Chamisso]] saw the core of Romanticism in the motif, and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] searched for the "Urpflanze" or "original plant" in Italy, which in some interpretations could refer to the blue flower. [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]] used the Blue Flower as a symbol for the poetry of ''Novalis'' and the "holy miracle of nature" in his short tale ''"Nachricht von den neuesten Schicksalen des Hundes Berganza"''.

In 1902, Charles Scribner's Sons published ''The Blue Flower'', a collection of short stories by [[Henry Van Dyke]], the first two of which, "The Blue Flower" and "The Source", refer to the blue flower as a symbol of desire and hope, and the object of the narrator's search. This volume also includes Van Dyke's most famous story, "[[The Other Wise Man]]".

[[File:Bluerosecropped.jpg|thumb|[[Blue rose]]]]
[[Walter Benjamin]] used the image of the blue flower several times in his writing. For example, the opening sentence of his essay ''Dream Kitsch'': "No one really dreams any longer of the Blue Flower. Whoever awakes as Heinrich von Ofterdingen today must have overslept." Also in his ''[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|Work of Art]]'' essay: "The equipment-free aspect of reality has here become the height of artifice, and the vision of immediate reality the Blue Flower in the land of technology."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/BENWOR.html ''The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility, and Other Writings on Media''], [[Harvard University Press]], {{ISBN|0-674-02445-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C.S. Lewis]], in his autobiographical book, ''Surprised By Joy,'' references the "Blue Flower" when speaking of the feelings of longing that beauty elicited when he was a child of six. He associates it with the German word [[sehnsucht]], and states that this intense longing for things transcendent made him "a votary of the Blue Flower."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8OskozFVBMYC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=c+s+lewis+surprised+by+joy+blue+flower&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vd7DBpp-aO&amp;sig=oBzJKQbI2obbo7_Ha547WMIgMLU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjB9JWWlP_eAhVk6oMKHZymBYMQ6AEwEHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=c%20s%20lewis%20surprised%20by%20joy%20blue%20flower&amp;f=false | title=C.S.

English writer [[Penelope Fitzgerald]]'s historical novel ''[[The Blue Flower]]'' is based on Novalis's early life. In [[John le CarrÃ©]]'s 1968 novel ''[[A Small Town in Germany]]'', the character Bradfield says, "I used to think I was a Romantic, always looking for the blue flower" (Pan edition, p.&amp;nbsp;286 â chap. 17). Substance D, a fictitious drug in [[Philip K. Dick]]'s 1977 novel ''[[A Scanner Darkly]]'', is derived from a plant with blue flower.

[[Tennessee Williams]] used images of blue roses in his play, ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', to symbolize the frailty and uniqueness of Laura, a central character that reflects the life of Williams' sister, who underwent a lobotomy. In the play, Laura is nicknamed "Blue Roses" after another character misheard her say "pleurosis".

In his fantasy series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', American author [[George R. R. Martin]] uses the blue flower as a reoccurring symbol to represent young women of the noble [[House Stark]], often with hints to an illicit love affair. In one instance, Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen#Rhaegar|Rhaegar Targaryen]] uses blue winter roses to crown the Lady [[House Stark#Lyanna|Lyanna Stark]] as the "Queen of Love and Beauty" at the Tournament of Harrenhal, passing over his own wife, Princess [[Major houses in A Song of Ice and Fire#Elia|Elia of Dorne]].

"Blaue Blume" is the name of a Danish pop band, whose lyrics are often about the themes of love, hope, emotion and longing. 

"Blue flowers echo from a cherry cloud" is a lyric in the song "[[Strawberry Letter 23]]" written by Shuggie Otis in 1971. In 1977, a cover of the song produced by Quincy Jones went on to become a number one hit on the US R&amp;B charts for the Brothers Johnson. 

"Blue Flower" is the name of a song by the British avant-garde pop band of the early 1970s, [[Slapp Happy]], later covered by the 1990s indy rock bands [[Pale Saints]] and [[Mazzy Star]]. "Blue Flowers" is a song by the alternative [[MC]], [[Kool Keith]] (AKA Dr. Octagon), on his 1996 album, ''[[Dr. Octagonecologyst]]''.

===Wandervogel movement===
In 1960 [[Werner Helwig]] published the book ''The Blue Flower of the [[Wandervogel]]'' (''Die blaue Blume des Wandervogels'') a history of the [[youth movement]]. Within the movement, a number of folk songs used the motif.

===The German student movement of the 60s===
In Berlin in 1968, one slogan of the [[German student movement]] stated ''"Schlagt die Germanistik tot, fÃ¤rbt die blaue Blume rot!"'' ("Strike [[Germanistics]] dead, color the blue flower red!") The discipline of Germanistics was targeted as a sclerotic field, not suited to the needs of the people of the present.

===Television, film, and theatre===
[[David Lynch]] uses the symbol of the blue flower in the 2010 short film "[[Lady Blue Shanghai]]", a 16-minute, promotional short film for fashion designer [[Dior]] starring [[Marion Cotillard]], among others. In the film a blue flower is hidden in a [[Dior]] handbag, at first feared and finally embraced by the female protagonist. It may be said that Lynch is associating the handbag with "divine" inspiration and creativity.

Stanley Kubrick made use of the Blue Flower in his final film, Eyes Wide Shut. Sandor Szavost (Sky Dumont) is wearing one while dancing with Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman).

In the movie follow-up to [[David Lynch]]'s television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', entitled ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'', two FBI agents are informed about their upcoming task through a woman named Lil. On her lapel is a tiny, artificial blue rose, clearly symbolic of something; but when Sam asks, Chet simply replies, "But I can't tell you about that."

Blue flower is featured in the 2005 film ''[[Batman Begins]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stephenfollows.com/resource-docs/scripts/batman_begins.pdf|title=Batman Begins shooting script|website=www.stephenfollows.com|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, a fear-intensifying hallucinogenic drug is manufactured from blue flowers. The drug is used by [[Ra's al Ghul]] and Dr. Jonathan Crane (the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]), who plan to terrorize [[Gotham City]] by weaponizing the drug into a concentrated powder form and release it into the city's water supply.

Blue flower is again used as the source of a fictitious mind-altering drug, here called Substance D, in the [[A Scanner Darkly (film)|2006 adaptation]] of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''A Scanner Darkly''.

A display of blue ''[[Baptisia australis]]'' flowers is used as a symbol of private support for an annual night of extrajudicial killings that serves as the central plot device of 2013 motion picture ''[[The Purge]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/06/06/the-purge-review/2107159/|title='Purge' this social experiment from your to-do list|website=www.usatoday.com|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James and Ruth Bauer, husband and wife collaborative team, wrote an unconventional music theatre piece entitled ''The Blue Flower'' at the turn of the 21st century. Speaking through liberally fictionalized versions of artists [[Max Beckmann]], [[Franz Marc]], and [[Hannah HÃ¶ch]] as well as pivotal female scientific figure [[Marie Curie]], the piece works with the romantic significance of the blue flower as it meditates on the brutal political and cultural turmoil of World War I, the short lived [[Weimar Republic]], and [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise to power in the [[Nazi Party]].

In ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', blue flower is prominent in the first cut scene where Solid Snake meets up with Naomi at the lab in South America.

A 2012 episode of the BBC television series ''[[New Tricks (TV series)|New Tricks]]'', entitled "Blue Flower", concerns the murder of an East German refugee who had been involved in the Blue Flower organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plot Summary for "New Tricks": Blue Flower (2012)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2128051/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl|work=IMDb|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blue flower is used in the 2016 film ''[[Zootopia]]''. In it, the flowers are called "night howlers" and are the source of a drug that causes mammals to become savage and attack anyone who comes near.

The "'''body without organs'''" ({{lang-fr|corps sans organes}}) is a concept used by French philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]]. It usually refers to the deeper reality underlying some well-formed whole constructed from fully functioning parts. At the same time, it may also describe a relationship to one's literal body.

Deleuze began using the term in ''[[The Logic of Sense]]'' (1969), while discussing the experiences of playwright [[Antonin Artaud]]. "Body without Organs" (or "BwO") later became a major part of the vocabulary for ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'', two volumes (''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' [1972] and ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' [1980]) written collaboratively with [[FÃ©lix Guattari]]. In these works, the term took on an expanded meaning, referring variously to literal bodies and to a certain perspective on realities of any type. The term's overloaded meaning is provocative, perhaps intentionally.&lt;ref name=Colombat1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Colombat|first=AndrÃ© Pierre|title=A Thousand Trails to Work with Deleuze|journal=SubStance|year=1991|issue=66|quote=The juxtaposition of these two incompatible fields and explanations creates a non-sense, an excess of sense, that puts in motion the intellect and the imagination of the reader.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early uses==

The term originates from [[Antonin Artaud]]'s radio play ''To Have Done with the Judgment of God'' (1947):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When you will have made him a body without organs, &lt;br /&gt;
then you will have delivered him from all his automatic reactions &lt;br /&gt;
and restored him to his true freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonin Artaud]]. "To Have Done with the Judgment of God" in ''Selected Writings''.  [[Susan Sontag]] (ed).  Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1976, p. 571.  {{oclc|473004317}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Deleuze first mentions the phrase in a chapter of ''[[The Logic of Sense]]'' called "The Schizophrenic and the Little Girl", which contrasts two distinct and peripheral ways of encountering the world. The Little Girl (whose exemplar is Alice), explores a world of 'surfaces': the shifting realm of social appearances and nonsense words which nevertheless seem to function. The Schizophrenic (whose exemplar is Artaud) is by contrast an explorer of 'depths', one who rejects the surface entirely and returns instead to the body.

For the Schizophrenic, words collapse, not into nonsense, but into the bodies that produce and hear them. Deleuze refers to "a new dimension of the schizophrenic body, an organism without parts which operates entirely by insufflation, respiration, evaporation and fluid transmission (the superior body or body without organs of Antonin Artaud)."&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze, ''The Logic of Sense'', p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; This body is also described as "howling", speaking a "language without articulation" that has more to do with the primal act of making sound than it does with communicating specific words.&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze, ''The Logic of Sense'', p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Capitalism and Schizophrenia''==

In Deleuze and Guattari's collaboration, the term describes an undifferentiated, unhierarchical realm that lies deeper than the world of appearances. It relates to the proto-world described in the mythology of many different cultures.&lt;ref name="Colebrook 2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Colebrook|first=Claire|title=Understanding Deleuze|year=2002|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=Crows Nest, N.S.W.|isbn=1865087971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deleuze and Guattari often use the example of the [[Dogon people|Dogon]] egg, based primarily on anthropological reports from [[Marcel Griaule]]. Describing the Dogon story of the origins of the cosmos, Griaule writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;These primordial movements are conceived in terms of an ovoid formâ'the egg of the world' (''aduno tal'')âwithin which lie, already differentiated, the germs of things; in consequence of the spiral movement of extension the germs develop first in seven segments of increasing length, representing the seven fundamental seeds of cultivation, which are to be found again in the human body [...]&lt;ref name="Griaule Dieterien 1954"&gt;{{cite book|title=African worlds; studies in the cosmological ideas and social values of African peoples.|year=1954 |origyear=1999|publisher=LIT Verlag|isbn=3825830861|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/5007776/Marcel-Griaule-The-Dogon|author=Marcel Griaule|author2=Germaine Dieterlen|editor=Cyril Daryll Forde|chapter=The Dogon|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Griaule, the basic patterns of organization within the egg reappear within all domains of Dogon life: kinship structures, village layout, understanding of the body, and so forth. The egg metaphor helps to suggest the gestation of a formation yet to come, and the potential formation of many actualities from a single origin.

===''Anti-Oedipus''===

[[File:Schleiden-vogel.jpg|thumb|Tiny differentiations in the developing egg designate major differences in the final creature.]]

In ''Anti-Oedipus'' Deleuze and Guattari expand the Body without Organs image by comparing its real potentials to the egg's : &lt;blockquote&gt;The body without organs is an egg: it is crisscrossed with axes and thresholds, with latitudes and longitudes and geodesic lines, traversed by gradients marking the transitions and the becomings, the destinations of the subject developing along these particular vectors (''Capitalism and Schizophrenia'', p.&amp;nbsp;19).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Deleuze and Guattari, every actual body has a limited set of traits, habits, movements, affects, etc. But every actual body also has a [[Virtuality (philosophy)|virtual]] dimension: a vast reservoir of potential traits, connections, affects, movements, etc. This collection of potentials is what Deleuze calls the BwO. The full body without organs is "schizophrenia as a clinical entity" (''Anti-Oedipus,'' p. 310). This drop in intensity is a means of blocking all investments of reality: "the unproductive, the sterile, the unengendered, the unconsumable" (''Anti-Oedipus,'' p. 9). Unlike other social machines such as the Body of the Earth, the Body of the Despot or the Body of Capital, the full body without organs cannot inscribe other bodies. The body without organs is "not an original primordial entity" (proof of an original nothingness) nor what is remains of a lost totality but is the "ultimate residue of a deterritorialized socius" (''Anti-Oedipus,'' p. 309). To "make oneself a body without organs," then, is to actively experiment with oneself to draw out and activate these virtual potentials. These potentials are mostly activated (or "actualized") through conjunctions with other bodies (or BwOs) that Deleuze calls "becomings."

Deleuze and Guattari use the term BwO in an extended sense, to refer to the virtual dimension of reality in general (which they more often call "plane of consistency" or "[[plane of immanence]]"). In this sense, they speak of a BwO of "the earth." "The Earth," they write, "is a body without organs. This body without organs is permeated by unformed, unstable matters, by flows in all directions, by free intensities or nomadic singularities, by mad or transitory particles" (''A Thousand Plateaus'', p.&amp;nbsp;40). That is, we usually think of the world as composed of relatively stable entities ("bodies," beings). But these bodies are really composed of sets of flows moving at various speeds (rocks and mountains as very slow-moving flows; living things as flows of biological material through developmental systems; language as flows of information, words, etc.). This fluid substratum is what Deleuze calls the BwO in a general sense.

=== ''A Thousand Plateaus'' ===

In ''A Thousand Plateaus'', Deleuze and Guattari eventually differentiate between three kinds of ''BwO'': cancerous, empty, and full. Roughly, the empty ''BwO'' is the ''BwO'' of ''Anti-Oedipus''.  This ''BwO'' is also described as "catatonic" because it is completely de-organ-ized; all flows pass through it freely, with no stopping, and no directing. Even though any form of [[Desiring-production|desire can be produced]] on it, the empty ''BwO'' is non-productive. The full ''BwO'' is the healthy ''BwO''; it is productive, but not petrified in its organ-ization. The cancerous ''BwO'' is caught in a pattern of endless reproduction of the self-same pattern. They give a rough recipe for building yourself a healthy BwO:

{{bq |text=This is how it should be done. Lodge yourself on a stratum, experiment with the opportunities it offers, find an advantageous place on it, find potential movements of deterritorialization, possible lines of flight, experience them, produce flow conjunctions here and there, try out continua of intensities segment by segment, have a small plot of new land at all times. It is through a meticulous relation with the strata that one succeeds in freeing lines of flight, causing conjugated flows to pass and escape and bringing forth continuous intensities for a BwO. (Deleuze &amp; Guattari, ''A Thousand Plateaus'', 1980/1987, p. 161)}}

Deleuze and Guattari suggest restraint here, writing that drug addicts and masochists may come closer to truly possessing bodies without organsâand die as a result. The 'healthy BwO' thus envisions the actual body without organs as a horizon, not a goal.&lt;ref name="Buchanan 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Ian|title=The Problem of the Body in Deleuze and Guattari, Or, What Can a Body Do?|journal=Body &amp; Society|date=1 September 1997|volume=3|issue=73|pages=73â91|doi=10.1177/1357034X97003003004|url=http://bod.sagepub.com/content/3/3/73|accessdate=31 August 2012|quote=Through their activities, the masochist, the anorexic or alcoholic, reduces his or her capacity for affection.

The ''BrahmajÄla SÅ«tra'' is related to the important [[Huayan]] metaphor of [[Indra's net]].

It is not related to the ''[[Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)|Brahmajala Sutta]]'' of the [[PÄli Canon]] of [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]].

==History==
The sutra is traditionally regarded as having been recorded in Sanskrit and then translated into Chinese by [[KumÄrajÄ«va]] in 406. Several scholars assume that it was composed in East Asia by unknown authors in the mid-5th century, and is [[Buddhist apocrypha|apocryphal]].&lt;ref name="eob"&gt;Cho, Eunsu.

==Content==
This sutra introduces [[Vairocana]] and his relationship to [[Gautama Buddha]]. It also states [[Bodhisattva Precepts#Brahma Net Sutra|ten major precepts for Bodhisattvas]] ({{CJKV|c=åéæ}}) and the 48 minor precepts to follow to advance along the bodhisattva path.

The bodhisattva precepts of the ''Brahmajala Sutra'' came to be treated in China as a higher ethic a monastic would adopt after ordination in addition to the [[prÄtimoká¹£a]] vows. In Japan, the ten precepts came to displace monastic rules almost completely starting with [[SaichÅ]] and the rise of the [[Tendai]].&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (2008). "Fang wang ching", in A Dictionary of Buddhism, Oxford University Press, 3rd ed. {{ISBN|0192800620}}, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the sutra derives from the vast net that the god [[Brahma]] hangs in his palace and how each jewel in the net reflects the light of every other jewel:
{{quote| At that time, he [Shakyamuni Buddha] contemplated the wonderful Jewel Net hung in Lord Brahma's palace and preached the Brahmajala Sutta for the Great Assembly. He said: "The innumerable worlds in the cosmos are like the eyes of the net. Each and every world is different, its variety infinite. So too are the Dharma Doors (methods of cultivation) taught by the Buddhas.&lt;ref name="online_sutra"&gt;Sutra Translation Committee of the US and Canada (2000).

The sutra is also noteworthy for describing who Vairocana is as personification of the [[dharma]] or [[DharmakÄya]]:&lt;ref name="online_sutra"/&gt;
{{quote| Now, I, Vairocana Buddha, am sitting atop a lotus pedestal; on a thousand flowers surrounding me are a thousand Sakyamuni Buddhas.

==Bodhisattva Precepts==

The ''Brahmajala Sutra'' has a list of ten major and forty-eight minor rules known as the [[Bodhisattva Precepts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr|editor2-last=Lopez|editor2-first=Donald S.

Typically, in East Asian Mahayana traditions, only the 10 Major Precepts are considered the Bodhisattva Precepts. According to the sutra, the 10 Major Bodhisattva Precepts are in summary:&lt;ref name="Thanh 2000"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thanh |first=Minh |title=The Brahma Net Sutra |year=2000 |url=http://www.ymba.org/bns/bnstext.htm#m1 |publisher=New York: Sutra Translation Committee of the United States and Canada |accessdate=10 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611151922/http://www.ymba.org/bns/bnstext.htm#m1 |archivedate=June 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Censorship (psychoanalysis)''' (''Censur'') is the force identified by [[Sigmund Freud]] as operating to separate consciousness from the unconscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neville Symington]], ''Narcissism'' (London 2003) p. x&lt;/ref&gt;

==In dreaming== 
In ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'', Freud identified a force working to disguise the dream-thoughts so as to make them more acceptable to the dreamer.  In his wartime lectures, he compared its operation to the contemporary newspapers, where blanks would reveal first-hand the work of the censor, but where allusions, circumlocutions, and other softening techniques also showed attempts to work round the censorship of thoughts in advance.&lt;ref&gt;S Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 170-1&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to characterise the motivating force, which he called "the self-observing agency as the ego-censor [''censor''], the conscience; it is this that exercises the dream-censorship [''censur''] during the night, from which the [[Repression (psychology)|repressions]] of inadmissable wishful impulses proceed".&lt;ref&gt;S Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 479&lt;/ref&gt;

Another tool used by the dream-censorship was [[Regression (psychology)|regression]] to archaic symbolic forms of expression unfamiliar to the conscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  Where all such measures of censorship failed, however, the result could be the development of nightmares and [[insomnia]].&lt;ref&gt;E Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (Penguin 1976) p. 144-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalytic extensions==
Freud found the same effects of disguise and omission taking place in the construction of neurotic symptoms, under the influence of the censorship, as in dreams.&lt;ref&gt;S Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; He would eventually assign the role of censor to the mental agency he would term the [[Id, ego and super-ego|superego]].&lt;ref&gt;S Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 2) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Sartre]] questioned how the censorship could operate unless it was already aware of the contents of the unconscious, and thought the phenomena Freud described could be better understood in terms of [[Bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]].&lt;ref&gt;J Webber, ''The Existentialism of Jean-Paul Sartre'' (2007) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Topological III by Robert R. Wilson, at Harvard University.JPG|upright|thumb|The configuration space of 3 not necessarily distinct points on the circle &lt;math&gt;T^3/S_3,&lt;/math&gt; is the above orbifold.]] --&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''configuration space''' (also known as '''Fadell's configuration space'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Fadell's+configuration+space|title=Fadell's configuration space in nLab|website=ncatlab.org|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a construction closely related to [[state space]]s or [[phase space]]s in physics. In physics, these are used to describe the state of a whole system as a single point in a high-dimensional space. In mathematics, they are used to describe assignments of a collection of points to positions in a [[topological space]]. More specifically, configuration spaces in mathematics are particular examples of [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration spaces in physics]] in the particular case of several non-colliding particles.

== Definition ==

For a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the '''''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; (ordered) configuration space of X''' is the set of ''n''-[[tuple]]s of pairwise distinct points in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Conf}_n(X):=\prod^n X \setminus \{(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)\in X^n \mid x_i=x_j\ \text{ for some  }i\neq j\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.4111.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

This space is generally endowed with the subspace topology from the inclusion of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Conf}_n(X)&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;X^n&lt;/math&gt;. It is also sometimes denoted &lt;math&gt;F(X, n)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F^n(X)&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}^n(X)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is a natural [[Group action|action]] of the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; on the points in &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Conf}_n(X)&lt;/math&gt; given by

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  S_n\times \operatorname{Conf}_n(X)&amp;\longrightarrow \operatorname{Conf}_n(X) \\
  (\sigma,x)&amp;\longmapsto \sigma(x)=(x_{\sigma(1)},x_{\sigma(2)},\ldots,x_{\sigma(n)}).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This action gives rise to the '''{{var|n}}&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; unordered configuration space of {{var|X}}''',

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{UConf}_n(X):=\operatorname{Conf}_n(X)/S_n&lt;/math&gt;,

which is the [[orbit space]] of that action. The intuition is that this action "forgets the names of the points". The unordered configuration space is sometimes denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{UC}^n(X)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The collection of unordered configuration spaces over all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Ran space]], and comes with a natural topology.

=== Alternative formulations ===
For a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and a finite set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, the '''configuration space of {{var|X}} with particles labeled by {{var|S}}''' is

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Conf}_S(X) := \{f\mid f:S\hookrightarrow X\text{ is injective}\}&lt;/math&gt;.

For &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}:=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the '''{{var|n}}&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; configuration space of ''X''''' is &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Conf}_{\mathbf{n}}(X)&lt;/math&gt;, and is denoted simply &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Conf}_n(X)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv |eprint=1612.08290|last1=Chettih|first1=Safia|title=The Homology of Configuration Spaces of Graphs|last2=LÃ¼tgehetmann|first2=Daniel|class=math.AT|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
{{Expand section|date=August 2017}}
* The space of ordered configuration of two points in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; is [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the product of the Euclidean 3-space with a circle, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Conf}_2(\mathbf{R}^2)\cong \mathbf{R}^3\times S^1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; More generally, the configuration space of two points in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is [[Homotopy|homotopy equivalent]] to the sphere &lt;math&gt;S^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Connection to braid groups ==
{{Main|Braid group}}

The '''{{var|n}}-strand braid group''' on a [[Connected space|connected]] topological space {{var|X}} is 
:&lt;math&gt;B_n(X):=\pi_1(\operatorname{UConf}_n(X))&lt;/math&gt;, 
the [[fundamental group]] of the {{var|n}}&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; unordered configuration space of {{var|X}}. The '''{{var|n}}-strand pure braid group''' on {{var|X}} is&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814291415_0004|title=Braids|last=Ghrist|first=Robert|date=2009-12-01|publisher=WORLD SCIENTIFIC|isbn=9789814291408|series=Lecture Notes Series, Institute for Mathematical Sciences, National University of Singapore|volume=Volume 19|pages=263â304|doi=10.1142/9789814291415_0004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_n(X):=\pi_1(\operatorname{Conf}_n(X))&lt;/math&gt;.

The first studied braid groups were the '''Artin braid groups''' &lt;math&gt;B_n\cong\pi_1(\operatorname{UConf}_n(\mathbf{R}^2))&lt;/math&gt;. While the above definition is not the one that [[Emil Artin]] gave, [[Adolf Hurwitz]] implicitly defined the Artin braid groups as fundamental groups of configuration spaces of the complex plane considerably before Artin's definition (in 1891).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |series=Lecture Notes in Mathematics |volume=372 |first=Wilhelm |last=Magnus | authorlink=Wilhelm Magnus |chapter=Braid groups: A survey |chapterurl=http://www.springerlink.com/content/2w7lp1402314k343/?p=8ca127a073654ea182c15cbecdeca393&amp;pi=3 |title=Proceedings of the Second International Conference on the Theory of Groups |publisher=Springer |year=1974 |isbn=978-3-540-06845-7 |pages=465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It follows from this definition and the fact that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Conf}_n(\mathbf{R}^2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{UConf}_n(\mathbf{R}^2)&lt;/math&gt; are [[EilenbergâMacLane space]]s of type &lt;math&gt;K(\pi,1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; that the unordered configuration space of the plane &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{UConf}_n(\mathbf{R}^2)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[classifying space]] of the Artin braid group, and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Conf}_n(\mathbf{R}^2)&lt;/math&gt; is the classifying space of the pure Artin braid group, when both are considered as [[discrete group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-31031-7_18|title=Vladimir I. Arnold - Collected Works|last=Arnold|first=Vladimir I.|date=1969|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=183â186|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-31031-7_18|author-link=Vladimir Arnold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Configuration spaces of manifolds ==

If the original space is a manifold, the configuration space of ''distinct,'' unordered points is also a manifold, while the configuration space of ''not necessarily distinct'' unordered points is instead an [[orbifold]].

A configuration space is a type of [[classifying space]] or (fine) [[moduli space]].  In particular, there is a universal bundle &lt;math&gt; \pi\colon E_n\to C_n &lt;/math&gt; which is a sub-bundle of the trivial bundle &lt;math&gt; C_n\times X\to C_n&lt;/math&gt;, and which has the property that the fiber over each point &lt;math&gt; p\in C_n&lt;/math&gt; is the ''n'' element subset of &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; classified by&amp;nbsp;''p''.

The homotopy type of configuration spaces is not [[homotopy invariant]] â for example, the spaces &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Conf}_n(\Bbb R^m)&lt;/math&gt; are not homotopy equivalent for any two distinct values of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Conf}_n(\Bbb R)&lt;/math&gt; is not connected, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Conf}_n(\Bbb R^2)&lt;/math&gt; is an [[EilenbergâMacLane space]] of type &lt;math&gt;K(\pi,1)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Conf}_n(\Bbb R^m)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Simply connected space|simply connected]] for &lt;math&gt; m \geq 3&lt;/math&gt;.

It used to be an open question whether there were examples of ''compact'' manifolds which were homotopy equivalent but had non-homotopy equivalent configuration spaces: such an example was found only in 2005 by Riccardo Longoni and Paolo Salvatore. Their example are two three-dimensional [[lens space]]s, and the configuration spaces of at least two points in them. That these configuration spaces are not homotopy equivalent was detected by [[Massey product]]s in their respective universal covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Configuration spaces are not homotopy invariant|year=2005|last1=Salvatore|last2=Longoni|first1=Paolo|first2=Riccardo|journal=Topology|volume=44|issue=2|pages=375&amp;ndash;380|doi=10.1016/j.top.2004.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homotopy invariance for configuration spaces of [[Simply connected space|simply connected]] closed manifolds remains open in general, and has been proved to hold over the base field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Campos|first=Ricardo|last2=Willwacher|first2=Thomas|author-link2=Thomas Willwacher|date=2016-04-07|title=A model for configuration spaces of points|eprint=1604.02043 |volume=|pages=|via=|class=math.QA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Idrissi|first=Najib|date=2016-08-29|title=The Lambrechts-Stanley Model of Configuration Spaces|eprint=1608.08054 |class=math.AT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Configuration spaces of graphs ==
Some results are particular to configuration spaces of [[Graph (topology)|graphs]]. [[Robert Ghrist]] motivates these problems as related to robotics and motion planning: one can imagine placing several robots on tracks and trying to navigate them to different positions without collision.

The term "'''death by sawing'''" indicates the act of sawing a living person in half, either [[Anatomical plane|sagittally]] (usually midsagittally), or transversely. Thus, [[decapitation]] by sawing or [[dismemberment]] by sawing are tangential sub-themes, though some ambiguous cases might be included. Death by sawing was a method of execution reportedly used in different parts of the world. Some of the reviewed examples are legendary.  At least one source states that the method was probably never used.&lt;ref&gt;''Schild'' (1997) p. 44 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
Different methods of death by sawing have been recorded. In cases related to the Roman Emperor [[Caligula]], the sawing is said to be through the middle ([[wiktionary:transversely|transversely]]).&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;''Scott'' (1995), p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In the cases of [[Morocco]], it is stated that the sawing was lengthwise, both from the groin and upwards and from the skull and downwards (mid[[wiktionary:sagittally|sagittally]]).&lt;ref name=Busnot1&gt;''Busnot'' (1717), [https://books.google.com/books?id=yiNSAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA167 pp.167â70]&lt;/ref&gt;

In only one case, in the story about [[Simon the Zealot]], the person is explicitly described as being hung upside-down and sawn apart vertically through the middle, starting at the groin, with no mention of fastening or support boards around the person, in the manner depicted in illustrations.&lt;ref name= "Geyer"&gt;''Geyer'' (1738) [https://books.google.com/books?id=o2VCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA631 p.631]&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases where details about the method beyond the mere sawing act are explicitly supplied, the condemned person was apparently fastened to either one or two boards prior to sawing.&lt;ref name=Busnot1 /&gt;

==Archaic Age and antiquity==
===Ancient Persia===
;The legend of Jamshid
[[Jamshid]] was a legendary [[shah]] of [[Greater Iran|Persia]], whose story is told in the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' by [[Ferdowsi]]. After 300 years of blessed reign, Jamshid forgot the blessings came from God, and began demanding that he be revered as a god himself. The people rebelled, and [[Zahhak]] had him sawn asunder.&lt;ref&gt;''Osborne'' (1744), [https://books.google.com/books?id=afRSAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA179 p.179]&lt;/ref&gt;
; Parysatis
[[Parysatis]], wife and half-sister of [[Darius II]] (r. 423â405 BC) was the real power behind the throne of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]; she instigated and became involved in a number of court intrigues, made several enemies, yet had an uncanny knack for dispatching them at an opportune time. At one point, she decided to have the siblings of her daughter-in-law [[Stateira (wife of Artaxerxes II)|Stateira]] killed, and only relented from killing Stateira as well due to the desperate pleas of her son, [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]]. Stateira's sister Roxana was the first of her siblings to be killed, by being sawn in half. When Dareius II died, Parysatis moved quickly, and was able to have the new queen Stateira poisoned; Parysatis still remained a power to be reckoned with for years after.&lt;ref&gt;''Osborne'' (1747), [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=266&amp;id=Y9gGAAAAcAAJ p.266]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Hormizd IV
[[Hormizd IV]] ({{lang-fa| ÙØ±ÙØ² ÚÙØ§Ø±Ù}}), son of [[Khosrow I]], reigned as the twenty-first [[Sasanian Empire|King of Persia]] from AD 579 to 590.&lt;ref&gt;''Dignas; Winter'' (2007) p.42&lt;/ref&gt; As the years went by, he was, due to his "cruelties", deeply resented by the nobility. In 590, a palace coup was staged in which his son, [[Khosrow II]], was declared king. Hormuzd IV was forced to watch his wife and one of his sons sawn in two, and the deposed king was then blinded. After a few days, the new king is said to have killed his old, blind father in a fit of rage.&lt;ref&gt;''Osborne'' (1742), [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=535&amp;id=tfJSAAAAcAAJ p.535]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thracians===
[[Thracians]] were regarded as warlike, ferocious, and bloodthirsty by Romans and Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;''Head; Heath'' (1982), p. 51, ''Webber; McBride'' (2001): "Perhaps the prospect of getting to the spoils explains Thucydides VII, 29: `For the Thracian race, like all the most bloodthirsty barbarians, are always particularly bloodthirsty when everything is going their own way", p.1&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notorious was the king [[Diegylis]], possibly only topped by his son [[Ziselmius]]. According to [[Diodorus Siculus]], Ziselmius sawed several persons to death and commanded their families to eat the flesh of their murdered relatives. The Thracians eventually rebelled, captured him and sought to inflict every conceivable torture upon him prior to his death.&lt;ref&gt;''Diodorus Seculus'' (1840), [https://books.google.com/books?id=LFg-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA2450 p.2450]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Rome===
;The Twelve Tables
Promulgated about 451 BC, the [[Twelve Tables]] is the oldest extant law code for the Romans. [[Aulus Gellius]], whose work "Attic Nights" is partially preserved, states that death by the saw was mentioned for some offenses in the tables, but that the use of which was so infrequent that no one could remember ever having seen it done.&lt;ref&gt;For Gellius' statement, see, ''RosenmÃ¼ller'' (1820), [https://books.google.com/books?id=dk8_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA95 p.95]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the retained laws in the Twelve Tables, the following concerning how creditors should proceed with debtors is found in Table 3, article 6: "On the third market-day they [the creditors] shall cut pieces. If they shall have cut more or less [than their shares], it shall be with impunity (_s[in]e fraude_)." The translator notes the ambiguity of the original text, but says that later Roman writers understood this to mean that creditors were allowed to cut their shares from the body of the debtor. If true, that would constitute dismemberment, rather than sawing.&lt;ref&gt;''Coleman-Norton'' (1948))[https://archive.org/stream/thetwelvetables14783gut/14783.txt The Twelve Tables]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Caligula
This method of execution was uncommon throughout the time of the [[Roman Empire]]. However, it was used extensively during the reign of [[Caligula]]&lt;ref&gt;Suet. Calig. 27: multos [...] medios serra dissecuit - , [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html Vita Caligulae] "Many..had them sawn asunder" [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html Life of Caligula]&lt;/ref&gt; when the condemned, including members of his own family, were sawn across the [[torso]] rather than lengthways down the body. It is said that Caligula would watch such executions while he ate, stating that witnessing the suffering acted as an appetiser.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt;
;The Kitos War
The [[Kitos War]] occurred 115â117 AD, and was a rebellion by the Jews within the Roman Empire. Major revolts happened several places, and the main source by [[Cassius Dio]] claims that in [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], 220,000 Greeks were massacred by the Jews; in [[Cyprus]], 240,000. Dio adds that many of the victims were sawn asunder, and that the Jews licked up the blood of the slain, and "twisted the entrails like a girdle about their bodies"&lt;ref&gt;''Gibbon'' (1776), [https://books.google.com/books?id=aLcWAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR76 Appendix, p.lxxvi]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Valens
In 365 AD, [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]] declared himself emperor, and moved against [[Valens]]. He was defeated in battle, and due to the treachery of his two generals Agilonius and [[Gomoarius]] (they had been promised they would be "shown favour" by Valens), he was captured. In 366, he was fastened to two trees bent down with force; when the trees were released, Procopius was ripped apart. The "favour" Valens showed to Agilonius and Gomoarius was to have them both sawn asunder.&lt;ref&gt;''Sozomen'' (1846), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lDmxf3_Ju1sC&amp;pg=PA262 p.262]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish tradition===
;Death of Isaiah
The prophet [[Isaiah]] was, according to some traditional rabbinic texts, sawn apart on orders of King [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh of Juda]].&lt;ref name="Warnekros"&gt;''Warnekros'' (1832), [https://books.google.com/books?id=P4hAAAAAcAAJ&amp;PA=711 p.368]&lt;/ref&gt; One tradition states that he was put within a tree, and then sawn apart; another says he was sawn apart by means of a wooden saw.&lt;ref&gt;''Du Pin'' (1699), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VzZWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA115 p.115]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian Martyrs===
;Simon the Zealot
[[File:ZersÃ¤gen des Heiligen Simon.png|thumb|Illustration by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] of St. Simon sawn in two]]
Several early Christians are credited with being martyred by means of a saw. The earliest, and most famous, is the obscure apostle of [[Jesus]], [[Simon the Zealot]]. He is said to have been martyred in [[Iran|Persia]], and that the express mode by which he was executed was to be hanged up by the feet, as in the woodcut illustration.&lt;ref name= "Geyer" /&gt;
;Conus and his son
Living in the age of [[Domitian]], Conus went, after his wife's death, with his 7-year-old son into a desert. However, he then had the idea of attacking paganism, and destroyed several idols in [[Konya|Cogni]], Asia Minor ([[Anatolia]]). Caught, he and his son were tortured by starvation and fire, but they were finally put to the saw, dying while they prayed.&lt;ref&gt;''Schmauss'' (1719), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e6VMAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA69 p.69]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Symphorosa and her seven sons
[[Symphorosa]] was, allegedly, a widow with seven sons living in the age of emperor [[Trajan]] (98-117). They were commanded to pray at a heathen temple, but refusing, Symphorosa was scourged, and then with a large stone fastened to her, thrown in the river [[Aniene]]. The six eldest sons were all killed by stab wounds, but the youngest, Eugenius, was sawn apart.&lt;ref&gt;''Foxe'' (1840), [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=5&amp;id=IeLq-CNyOcIC p.5]&lt;/ref&gt; However, she may have been killed ca. 138, near the end of the reign of [[Hadrian]] (117â138).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14379a.htm Symphorosa] at the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;
;The 38 monks and martyrs on Mount Sinai
Supposedly during the reign of [[Diocletian]], a community of monks lived at [[Mount Sinai]]. One day, the "wild barbarians" (said to be inveterate robbers and even cannibalizing their own sons occasionally) decided to rob the community. But, there was nothing of material wealth there, and in their rage, the Arabs slaughtered them all, several by [[flaying]], others by sawing them with dull saws.&lt;ref&gt;''Deinl'' (1850), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MhJNAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA42 p.42]&lt;/ref&gt;
;St. Tarbula
Accused of practicing witchcraft and of causing sickness to befall the wife of the ardently anti-Christian Persian king [[Shapur II]], she was condemned and executed by being sawed in half in the year 345.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=1909 St. Tarbula]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
;The monk from Montepulciano
In the 1630s, there are several reports from the [[Levant]] and Egypt that monks were killed. One of them, Brother Conrad d'Elis Barthelemy, a native of [[Montepulciano]] is said to have been sawn in two, from the head and downwards.&lt;ref&gt;''Chateaubriand'' (1812), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3uFBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA143 p.143]&lt;/ref&gt;
; The renegade Coptic governor
Writing in 1843, William Holt Yates speaks of a governor under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] (r.1801â49), Abd-ur-Rahman Bey, who was said to be particularly cruel and avaricious. He was a renegade [[Copts|Copt]], and abused his position to gain hold of wealth. He is even credited with having sawed people in two. Yates further supplies the detail: "This fellow has since been assassinated-report says, with sanction and approval of the Government"&lt;ref&gt;''Yates'' (1843), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7WRCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA123 p.123] More on this governor and his assassination in 1840 in ''Gliddon'' (1841), [https://books.google.com/books?id=YWQGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA70 p.70-72, footnote]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morocco===
;1705 The sawing of Alcaide Melec
One of the most notorious cases of sawing as execution is that of the [[Qaid|Alcaide]] (castellan/governor) Melec under emperor [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Moulay Ishmael]] (r. 1672â1727). The fullest description of this execution is found in Dominique Busnot's&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Dominique Busnot]]&lt;/ref&gt; 1714 work ''Histoire du rÃ¨gne de Mouley Ismael'', although a brief notice of the event can be found in the January 1706 edition of ''Present state of Europe''.&lt;ref name="Rhodes"&gt;''Rhodes'' (1706), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bwALAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA46 p.46]&lt;/ref&gt; In the following, the tale as told by Busnot will be given.&lt;ref name="Busnot1" /&gt;

Melec was judged as the chief rebel to be punished in a rebellion instigated by one of the emperor's sons, Mulay Muhammad. In particular, according to Busnot, the empress was incensed that Melec had personally beheaded one of her cousins, Ali Bouchasra.&lt;ref&gt;''Busnot'' (1716), [https://books.google.com/books?id=yiNSAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA167 p.66-67]&lt;/ref&gt; In September/October 1705,&lt;ref name="Rhodes" /&gt; Mulay Ismail sent for his chief carpenter and asked if his saws were capable of sawing a man in two. The carpenter answered "Sure enough". He was then given the grisly task, and before he left, he asked him whether Melec should be sawn across or along the length. The emperor said the sawing should proceed lengthwise, from the head downwards. He told, however, Boachasra's sons, they should follow the carpenter and decide for themselves how best to take revenge upon the murderer (i.e., Melec) of their father. Taking with him 8 of the public executioner's assistants, the master carpenter went to the prison where Melec was held, two of his brand new saws packed in cloth, in order to keep from Melec information of the intended manner of execution. Melec was now placed on a mule, bound with an iron chain, and led to the public square, where some 4000 of his relatives and members of his tribe were assembled. These made a "terrifying" spectacle through screaming, and clawing their faces in a public display of grief. Melec, on the other hand, seemed unperturbed, calmly smoking from his tobacco pipe. When taken down from the mule, Melec's clothes were removed, damning letters "proving" his treason was cast in the fire.

Then, he was strapped onto a board, and placed upon a sawbench, his arms and legs fastened. The executioner's team then sought to start by sawing him from the head downwards, but Boucasra's sons intervened, and demanded that one began between Melec's legs instead, because otherwise, he would die too quickly. Under the terrible screams of Melec and his relatives, thus began his execution. Once they had sawed him up to the navel, they pulled out the saw in order to commence from the other side. Melec is said to have been still conscious, asking for some water. His friends, though, thought it best to hasten his demise and shorten his sufferings, and the executioners went on, sawing him from skull to navel so he fell apart. In the process, chunks of flesh were ripped out by the saw's teeth, causing blood to splatter everywhere, thus making the execution quite unbearable to watch.

Around 300 other conspirators were [[Impalement|impaled]] alive, and another report states that in addition to these, some other 20 chief conspirators had their arms and legs sawed off, and left to expire in the marketplace.&lt;ref name="Rhodes" /&gt;
;1721 The sawing of Larbe Shott
19 July 1721, a noble descended from the [[Andalusia]]n [[Moors]], Larbe Shott was put to the saw. He had spent considerable time at [[Gibraltar]], and one of the crimes imputed to him was to have spent time in Christian kingdoms without his emperor's leave. Furthermore, he had been found guilty of defiling himself with Christian women, and often drunk alcohol. In short, he was charged as an apostate and unbeliever, in addition to being charged with having invited the "Spaniards" to invade [[Barbary Coast|Barbary]] (i.e., treason). They brought him to one of the gates in the city, fastened him between two boards, and sawed him in two, from skull and downwards. After his death, Mulay Ishmael pardoned him, so that his body could be picked up and given a decent burial at least, instead of being eaten by the dogs.&lt;ref&gt;''Windus'' (1725), [https://books.google.com/books?id=rmRCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA156 p.156-57]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Swiss sawing
In 1757, a French officer was executed by his men in a mutiny on [[Cat Island (Mississippi)|Cat Island]] in current-day [[Mississippi]]. Three of the mutineers were eventually captured and brought to [[New Orleans]] for trial. After conviction, two of the mutineers died on the [[Breaking wheel|French wheel]]. The last mutineer, a Swiss from the Karrer regiment, was allegedly, nailed into a coffin-shaped wooden box, and it was sawed into with a cross-cut saw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cuevas, John|title=The History of a Mississippi Gulf Coast Barrier Island|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTP8fxliBI4C&amp;pg=PA20|year=2011|publisher=McFarland|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim of a Swiss being sawed in two was first made by the French captain and traveller [[Jean Bernard Bossu]] in his 1768 ''Nouveaux Voyages aux Indes Occidentales'', translated into English by [[Johann Reinhold Forster]] in 1771.&lt;ref&gt;On French publication date and biographical details of Bossu, see: [http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=5922 Jean Bernard Bossu (1720â1792)] at the website: "[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/ Encyclopedia of Arkansas History&amp;Culture]". On relevant excerpt, see ''Forster'' (1771), [https://books.google.com/books?id=QiYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA324 p.324-325]&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on Bossu's general reliability in a footnote to his essay ''A Map within an Indian Painting?'', jurist [[Morris S. Arnold]] says the following: "Bossu's books contain a lot of tall tales, so one needs to be cautious about relying on him".&lt;ref&gt;''Lewis, Arnold'' (1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=h2tGe9U39UIC&amp;pg=PA200 footnote 11, p.200]&lt;/ref&gt; Bossu claims that being "sawed asunder" was a traditional Swiss military punishment, and alleges that one Swiss mutineer actually committed suicide to avoid that punishment.&lt;ref&gt;''Forster'' (1771), [https://books.google.com/books?id=QiYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA324 p.324]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the one who was allegedly sawed in half had his punishment as governed by Swiss military law, rather than French. An incident from 1741 (in [[Louisbourg]], Canada) shows that at that time, when two Frenchmen and a Swiss were executed, Swiss mercenary troops had been placed under French military law, rather than under Swiss.&lt;ref&gt;" Whatever the rights and wrongs of a particular case might be, the Swiss were not to be treated as an independent unit and their officers must be subordinate to the French commandant", at [http://fortress.cbu.ca/justice/Karrer.htm The Administration Of Justice At The Fortress Of Louisbourg (1713-1758)], excerpted from Greer (1976), "The Soldiers of Isle Royale, 1720-1745"&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, detailing the recorded executions in the Swiss [[Canton of ZÃ¼rich]] through the 15th-18th century, Gerold Meyer von Knonau records 1445 executions in total, none of them being through death by sawing.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Meyer_von_Knonau,_Gerold_%28Archivar%29 Knonau]'' (1846) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=335&amp;id=4xRMAAAAYAAJ p.335]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Haitian revolution
In August 1791, a [[Haitian Revolution#1791 slave rebellion|great slave revolt]] broke out at [[Saint-Domingue]], eventually leading to Haitian independence. In the process, some 4,000 white planters and their family members were massacred.&lt;ref&gt;''Censer and Hunt'' (2001), p.124&lt;/ref&gt; One of the victims was a carpenter by trade, Robert. The rebels decided he "should die in the way of his occupation" and accordingly fastened him between two boards and sawed him apart.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (1819), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TcI-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA79 p.79]&lt;/ref&gt;

;An episode from the Crusades
In 1123, [[Joscelin I, Count of Edessa|Joscelin de Courtenay]] and [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]] were separately ambushed and surprised by a Turkish [[emir]], Balac, and made prisoners at the castle at Quartapiert. Some 50 [[Armenians]], bound by oath to Joscelin as [[Count of Edessa]], decided to free their liege lord as well as Baldwin II. Dressed as monks and pedlars, they gained entry in the town where the two nobles were held captive, and managed, through massacre, to take control of the castle. Joscelin slipped out in order to raise a force, while Baldwin II and his nephew Galeran remained behind to hold the castle. Apprised of the capture of the castle, Balac sent quickly a force to recapture it, and Baldwin II saw no possibility of holding it. Graciously, Balac took Baldwin and his nephew merely prisoners. Not so merciful was he towards the Armenians: Several of them were flayed, others buried up to the neck and used as target practice, the rest were sawn apart.&lt;ref&gt;''Collins'' (1812), [https://books.google.com/books?id=YhIwAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA220 p.220]&lt;/ref&gt;
;The Assassins
The [[Assassins]], a misnomer for the [[Nizari]], an [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] sect, had an independent kingdom in the Levant during the age of the [[Crusades]], and were feared and loathed by Muslims and Christians alike. The Jewish traveller [[Benjamin of Tudela]], travelling the region around 1157 notes that the Assassins were reputed to saw in two the kings of other peoples, if they managed to capture them.&lt;ref&gt;''Benjamin of Tudela'' (1858), [https://books.google.com/books?id=LR09AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA10 p.10]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman Empire===
A number of accounts exist where the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] are said to have sawn persons in two, most of them said to occur in [[Mehmed the Conqueror]]'s reign (1451â81).

A number of cruel excesses against the populace of [[Constantinople]] is said to have happened in the wake of the [[Fall of Constantinople|taking of the city]]. according to one rendering of the tale:&lt;ref&gt;''Salisbury'' (1830), [https://books.google.com/books?id=24BUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA225 p.225]&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|They no sooner found themselves masters of it, than they began to exercise On the inhabitants the most unremitting barbarities, destroying them by every method of ingenious cruelty. Some they roasted alive on spits, others they starved, some they flayed alive, and left them in that horrid manner to perish; many were sawn asunder, and others torn to pieces by horses. Three days and nights was the city given to spoil, in which time the soldiers were licensed to commit every enormity}}
;1460 Capture of Mystras
After the last [[Despotate of the Morea|Despot of Morea]], [[Demetrios Palaiologos]] in 1460 switched allegiance to the Turks and gave them entry to Mystras, a tale grew up that the actual [[castellan]] at the castle of [[Mystras]] was ordered sawn in two. This tale was "well known" in later centuries, whatever actual veracity.&lt;ref&gt;''Pouqueville'' (1813), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ar9BAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA82 p.82]&lt;/ref&gt;
;1460 Michael SzilÃ¡gyi
In 1460, the Hungarian general [[Michael SzilÃ¡gyi]] was seized by the Turks, and since he was regarded as a traitor and spy, he was sawed in half at Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;Grumeza (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DTxu6RxdecUC&amp;pg=PA8 p.8]&lt;/ref&gt;
; 1460-64 campaigns and slaughter in the Morea
In the following years, inhabitants in Greece under the Venetians fought several battles in the Morea. In 1464, for example, a small city is said to have been subdued, and 500 prisoners sent to Constantinople. There, they were put to the saw, according to one account.&lt;ref&gt;''Fallmerayer'' (1836), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2xKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA420 p.420]&lt;/ref&gt;
;1463 conquest of Mytilene, Lesbos
The [[Knights Hospitaller]]s, then stationed at [[Rhodes]], sent several knights to aid in the defence of [[Mytilene]] from the Turks. They eventually surrendered, under promise of having their lives spared. Instead, according to some reports, they were sawed asunder.&lt;ref&gt;''Mignot'' (1787), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2eApAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA162 p.162]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Kenneth Setton|Kenneth Meyer Setton]], the [[sultan]] had actually promised to spare the heads of some 400 knights, and sawed them in half to keep his oath of not harming the heads.&lt;ref&gt;''Setton'' (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0Sz2VYI0l1IC&amp;pg=PA238 p.238]&lt;/ref&gt;
;1469/1470 conquest of Negroponte
The [[Triarchy of Negroponte]], a [[Crusader states|Crusader state]] or ''[[Stato da MÃ r]]'' under control of the [[Republic of Venice]], was extinguished by the [[Battle of Negropont|capture of the city]] in 1469/1470, and the governor Paolo Erizzo, is said to treacherously to have been ordered sawn in two, after have being promised his life would be spared. The sultan, Mehmed the Conqueror, is said to have cut off the head of Erizzo's daughter by his own hands, because she would not yield to his desires.&lt;ref&gt;''Watkins'' (1806), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Sxs2AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PT366 p.366]&lt;/ref&gt;
;1473 the arsonist at Gallipoli
In 1473, a Sicilian called Anthony, is said to have managed set fire to the sultan's ships at the [[Sanjak of Gelibolu]], [[Gallipoli]]. After being captured at [[Chalcis|Negroponte]], he was brought before the sultan who asked him what harm had been done to him that he performed such an evil deed? The young man answered that he simply wanted to harm the enemy of Christianity in some glorious way. The sultan is said to have ordered that Anthony should be sawn in two.&lt;ref&gt;'''a)'''For dating and place of capture, ''Lempriere'' (1825), [https://books.google.com/books?id=nHRkAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA99 p.99]" '''b)''' For interview between Anthony and sultan, see: ''von Kreckwitz'' (1654), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Py9RAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA240 p.240]"&lt;/ref&gt;
;1480 invasion of Otranto
In 1480, the Ottomans, led by [[Gedik Ahmed Pasha]], invaded mainland Italy, [[Ottoman invasion of Otranto|occupying]] [[Otranto]]. A [[Martyrs of Otranto|general massacre]], of disputed magnitude,&lt;ref&gt;11.000, by "traditional" count, see for example ''Smedley'' (1832), [https://books.google.com/books?id=QHI2AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA110 p.110]&lt;/ref&gt; occurred. Archbishop [[Stefano Pendinelli]] was, by some reports, ordered to be sawn in half.&lt;ref&gt;''Reider'' (1841), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ax88bYJY4CcC&amp;pg=PA125 p.125]&lt;/ref&gt;
;1611 revolt of Dionysius the Philosopher
[[Dionysius the Philosopher]] led an eventually unsuccessful revolt against the Ottomans, seeking to establish a power base at [[Ioannina]]. Dionysius was flayed alive, and his skin, stuffed with straw, was sent as a present to the sultan, [[Ahmed I]], at Constantinople. The other principal conspirators were said to be punished in various ways, some were burnt alive, others impaled, and yet others sawn asunder.&lt;ref&gt;''Hughes'' (1820), [https://books.google.com/books?id=cpvOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA22 p.22]&lt;/ref&gt;
;The mythologized death of Rhigas, the protomartyr of Greek independence
[[Rigas Feraios]] (1760â98), was an early Greek patriot, whose struggle for independence of Greece preceded with about 30 years the general uprising known as the [[Greek War of Independence]]. His actual manner of death has garnered many tales; [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica 1911]], for example, states that he was shot in the back.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/r/constantine_rhigas.html CONSTANTINE RHIGAS]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet others state that he was strangled. Some 19th century stories report that he was sawn in two.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: ''Wigand'' (1844)[https://books.google.com/books?id=uQVIAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA307 p.307]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, one source asserts he was beheaded.&lt;ref&gt;''Aurach'' (1859), [https://books.google.com/books?id=tKdBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA82 p.82]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mughal Empire===
[[File:Bhai Mati Das.jpg|thumb|Martyrdom of Bhai Mati Das]]
The Sikh [[Bhai Mati Das]], a follower of the 9th guru, [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]] was in 1675 AD ordered executed by emperor [[Aurangzeb]], along with several other prominent Sikhs, including their Guru, because of their refusal to convert to Islam. Bhai Mati Das was sawed in half, the others in different manners.&lt;ref&gt;''Singha'' (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=gqIbJz7vMn0C&amp;pg=PA142 p.142]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burma===
Several reports state that even in the 1820s, sawing criminals in two was an occasional punishment in Burma for "certain offenses". The criminals were fastened between two planks prior to the sawing.&lt;ref&gt;''Murray'' (1829), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DAussrqql4AC&amp;pg=PA44 p.44]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this might possibly have been conflated by reports of ''[[disembowelment]]'', for which eyewitness reports exist.&lt;ref&gt;For eyewitness report disembowelment ''Judson'' (1823), [https://books.google.com/books?id=J00RAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA84 p.84-86]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burmese general [[Maha Bandula]] is said to have had one of his high-ranking officers sawn in two, due to some act of disobedience, the person being fastened between two planks for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;''Knowles'' (1830) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz4XAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA167 p.167-68]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
;Martyrdom of Augustin Huy
On occasion, a confusion of reports may exist where, for example, performed post-mortem indignities are misinterpreted as the actual manner of execution:

In 1839, the governor of Vietnam's [[Nam Äá»nh Province]] summoned five hundred soldiers to a banquet to pressure them into trampling upon a cross in renunciation of Christianity. Most of the guests complied, but three Catholic soldiers refused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=5837 St. Domingo Nicolas Dat Dinh]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the [[Vietnamese Martyrs]], Augustin Huy, is reported by some sources to have been sawed in two.&lt;ref&gt;''Sadler'' (1858), [https://books.google.com/books?id=yvC4swXcfw0C&amp;pg=PA356 p.356] ''Pachtler'' (1861), [https://books.google.com/books?id=tyM3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA353 p.353]&lt;/ref&gt; Others report that he was hacked to death,&lt;ref&gt;''Inderbitzi'' (1840), [https://books.google.com/books?id=tJ0AAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA548 p.548]" ''Hahn'' (1860), [https://books.google.com/books?id=fKkAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA120 p.120-21]&lt;/ref&gt; or cut in two.&lt;ref&gt;''Inst. Prop. Faith'' (1840), [https://books.google.com/books?id=z5AAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA559 p.559-60]&lt;/ref&gt; But, a letter from 1839, just three weeks after the execution 12 June, states that he was beheaded.:&lt;ref&gt;''Asiat. Journ.'' (1840), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vysYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA120 p.120]&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"I have to announce to you the death of two Tonquinese, who here shed their blood for the faith on the 12th of June, 1839. They were beheaded near the port of Cua-thuan-an, the principal port of Hue. Their bodies were first cut into five pieces and then cast into the sea.}}

===Imperial China===
;Technique
The movement of a saw may cause a body to sway back and forth making the process difficult for the executioners. The Chinese overcame this problem by securing the victim in an upright position between two boards firmly fixed between stakes driven deep into the ground. Two executioners, one at each end of the saw, would saw downwards through the stabilized boards and enclosed victim.&lt;ref&gt;''Abbott'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Whether sawing as an execution method actually existed, or that cases referred to are garbled accounts of the "[[Lingchi|slow slicing]]" method of execution will remain an open question.
;Tang dynasty
The emperor [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Zhaozong of Tang]] (r. 888â904) is said to have commanded one of his prisoners sawn asunder.&lt;ref&gt;''Bridgman'' (1841), [https://books.google.com/books?id=eJYZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA148 p.141]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Qing dynasty
When the [[Chongzhen Emperor|last emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty]] committed suicide in 1644, the [[Shunzhi Emperor|new emperor]] had one of the previous regime's strongest supporters, Chen, said to be viceroy of Canton, sawed in two. However, growing in popularity in his martyrdom, the new regime condemned the execution of Chen, declared him to have been a holy man, and erected a pagoda in Canton for his memory.&lt;ref&gt;''GÃ¼nther'' (1856), [https://books.google.com/books?id=sBRKAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA20 p.20]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==
===Spain===
;Morisco revolt
In the aftermath of the destruction of the last Islamic kingdom in Spain, Granada in 1492, the [[Morisco]]es, the descendants of Muslims and those who still were, in secret, adherents of Islam, felt increasingly persecuted. In 1568, the [[Morisco rebellions in Granada|Morisco revolt]] broke out, under leadership of [[Aben Humeya]]. The crushing of the revolt was extremely bloody, and at [[AlmerÃ­a]] 1569, the historian [[Luis del MÃ¡rmol Carvajal|Luis del Marmol Carvajal]] states that one Morisco was sawn apart alive.&lt;ref&gt;''de Ferreras'' (1760), [https://books.google.com/books?id=CCRDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA89 p.89]&lt;/ref&gt;
;La Mancha rebellion
In the Spanish rebellion of 1808 against the occupying French forces, reports exist that some French officers were sawed in two. In one of those reports, it is colonel Rene (or Frene&lt;ref&gt;''Napier'' (1862), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7m8PAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA88 p.88]&lt;/ref&gt;) who met this fate.&lt;ref&gt;''Napier'' (1839), [https://books.google.com/books?id=pxBAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA73 p.73]&lt;/ref&gt; In another report, Rene was merely thrown into a kettle of boiling water, whereas the officers Caynier and Vaugien were the ones sawed in two.&lt;ref&gt;''Foy'' (1827), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ufbi8fQ8mm4C&amp;pg=PA192 p.192]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
;1812 the ''Grande ArmÃ©e''
After the [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|Fire of Moscow]] in September 1812, the French [[Grande ArmÃ©e]] had not exactly endeared itself to the local population. The peasant population is said to have become embittered, fanaticized, and even developed an effective [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]. In addition, the "wild [[Cossacks]]" lurked about, and both groups of Russians could be a deadly enemy to solitary French soldiers. Some of those unfortunates are said to have been sawed apart.&lt;ref&gt;''Heyne'' (1840)[https://books.google.com/books?id=otNBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA386 p.386]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
;1848 Revolution
The [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] was a bitter struggle where different ethnicities and people of different religious persuasions committed atrocities against others. A decidedly partisan pamphlet from 1850, ''Ungarns gutes recht'' (''The well-founded right of Hungary'') from 1850, states that in the struggles around [[Banat]], some 4,000 Serbians, spurred on by the preaching of the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci|Metropolitan of Karlovci]], [[Josif RajaÄiÄ]], committed heinous deeds against the Hungarians. Women, children and old men were mutilated, roasted over slow fires, some sawn apart.&lt;ref&gt;''Anon'' (1850), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MTYsAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA50 p.50]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
===Tortures in Hell===
;Hindu mythology
In Hindu lore, [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]] is the god of death. He determines the punishments to those who were wicked in life. Those guilty of robbing a [[Brahmin]], are to be sawn apart while being in ''[[Naraka (Hinduism)|Naraka]]'' (Hell).&lt;ref&gt;''Majer'' (1804), [https://books.google.com/books?id=R-JAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=346 p.346]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Chinese mythology
Sawing people asunder is one of the punishments said to occur in [[Naraka (Buddhism)|Buddhist Hell]], and the priests knew how to make a visible spectacle of sufferings in the beyond, by commissioning artists to make paintings the populace were meant to see and reflect upon:&lt;ref&gt;''Lay'' (1841), [https://books.google.com/books?id=5T8PAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA195 p.195]&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|At a Buddhist temple in Canton, at certain seasons of the year, the court is set round with pictures, which pourtray in a fearful manner the sufferings of the dead. Some are sawn asunder; some are gored with pitchforks; some are thrown into a cauldron of boiling water; others are burnt. The artists, under the gifted instruction of the priests, succeeded in representing every sight that is terrible to the eye or revolting to the senses. In the recess at Mongha beforementioned, a few of these choice subjects were displayed with an edifying effect. The presumed existence of a place of torment brings a revenue into the coffers of the priest, who is assumed to have the power of appeasing the wrath of the judges..}}

===Segare la vecchia===
In Italy and Spain, a curious tradition of "segare la vecchia" ("sawing the old woman") was upheld on [[Laetare Sunday]] (Mid-[[Lent]] Sunday) in hamlets and towns, well into the 19th century. The custom consisted of the boys running about to find the "oldest woman in the village", and then make a wooden effigy in her likeness. Then, the wooden figure was sawn across the middle. The folklorist [[Jacob Grimm]] regards this as an odd spring ritual, in which the "old year"/winter is symbolically defeated. He also notes that a rather similar custom existed in his day among [[South Slavs|Southern Slavs]].&lt;ref&gt;''Grimm'' (1835) [https://books.google.com/books?id=OhIWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA453 p.453]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Walk to Freedom''' was a mass march during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] on June 23, 1963 in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. It drew crowds of an estimated 125,000 or more and was known as "the largest civil rights demonstration in the nation's history" up to that date.  
 
Various ministers and leaders of local and national organizations including the Mayor of Detroit were in attendance and gave speeches. Among them was [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] who after the Walk to Freedom March gave an impassioned speech. It was a precursor to his famous "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech given weeks later in [[Washington, D.C.]]. The march itself was, to King and his supporters, partly a practice run of the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]].&lt;ref name=Sugrue&gt;{{cite book|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas J.|title=Sweet Land of Liberty: The Forgotten Struggle for Civil Rights in the North|year=2008|publisher=Random House|isbn=9780679643036|pages=298â301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the greater size of the March on Washington, the Detroit Walk to Freedom has been somewhat lost to obscurity outside of local Detroit history.&lt;ref name="Freedom North"&gt;{{cite book|title=Freedom North: Black Freedom Struggles Outside the South, 1940-1980|year=2003|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780312294670|pages=166â168}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Dr. King called it "one of the most wonderful things that has happened in America."&lt;ref name=Reuther&gt;{{cite web|title=Detroit's Walk to Freedom|url=https://www.reuther.wayne.edu/node/7858|work=Walter P.

== Origins ==

Reverend [[Clarence L. Franklin]] and Reverend [[Albert Cleage]] were Civil Rights leaders who, although they had very different viewpoints and methods of tackling injustice, came together and proposed the idea of having a large march or demonstration in Detroit.&lt;ref name=Joseph&gt;{{cite book|last=Joseph|first=Peniel E.|authorlink=Peniel E. Joseph|title=Waiting 'Til the Midnight Hour: A Narrative History of Black Power in America|year=2006|publisher=Henry Holt and Co.|isbn=9780805075397|pages=75â76, 81â84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together along with other organizers, they formed the Detroit Council for Human Rights which would be the organization that would actually put on the Walk to Freedom march.&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt; Cleage originally wanted the march to be all black and led by blacks only; however, the local Detroit branch of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) was prepared to not support the march and even boycott it if the DCHR did not include some local white leaders in the march.&lt;ref name="Freedom North" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sugrue /&gt;   Although the march was open to all, the vast majority that came to the march were African-American, but there were several prominent whites, such as the [[Mayor of Detroit, Michigan|Mayor of Detroit]] [[Jerome Cavanagh]], who joined in leading the march or otherwise showed their support.&lt;ref name=Sugrue /&gt;

== Purpose ==

The Walk to Freedom had two main purposes. The first and main purpose of the march "â¦ was to speak out against segregation and the brutality that met civil rights activists in the South while at the same time addressing concerns of African Americans in the urban North: inequality in hiring practices, wages, education, and housing."&lt;ref name="Reuther"/&gt;  The second purpose of the march was to raise funds and awareness for the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), which was an organization that did civil rights work in the south.&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt; The date that was picked to be when the march would take place, June 23, was to honor the 20th anniversary of [[Detroit race riot of 1943]] in which over two dozen people were killed and many more injured.&lt;ref name=Reuther /&gt;

== The March ==

=== Who Marched ===

Many prominent people, known locally and nationally, lead the Walk to Freedom. From the Detroit Council for Human Rights: Rev. C. L. Franklin, father of famous singer [[Aretha Franklin]] and was chairman of the DCHR;  Rev. Albert Cleage, who was a part of forming the DCHR; and Benjamin McFall, director of the DCHR. The former [[Governor of Michigan]] [[John Swainson]], who was governor from 1961-1962, joined with the Mayor of Detroit Jerome Cavanaugh, and Martin Luther King Jr.&lt;ref name=Garrett&gt;{{cite web|last=Garrett|first=Bob|title=Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Detroit Freedom Walk|url=http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-54463_19313_20652_19271_19357-205425--,00.html|work=michigan.gov|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also leading the march was [[Walter Reuther]], president of the [[United Auto Workers]] (UAW); [[Billie S. Farnum]], who was the State Auditor General.&lt;ref name=Garrett /&gt;  [[George W. Romney|George Romney]], then current Governor of Michigan, was unable to attend the march because it took place on a Sunday and conflicted with his religious practices; however, since Romney fully supported the march and the cause, he sent representatives to walk in his place.&lt;ref name=Romney&gt;{{cite web|title=George Romney â working with Martin Luther King, Jr. for Civil Rights|url=http://www.aboutmittromney.com/romney_and_king.htm|work=aboutMittRomney.com|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Route of the March ===

To generate interest in the Walk to Freedom, stickers, handbills, and other advertisements were spread around the city by event planners.&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt;  The march itself started, at about 3pm, on [[Woodward Avenue]] and Adelaide, it continued on Woodward, and then onto Jefferson and concluded at [[Cobo Arena|Cobo Arena and Hall]].&lt;ref name=Reuther /&gt;  Songs were sung, such as "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]", and people carried banners and signs.&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrett /&gt;   The whole march only lasted about an hour and a half, but afterwards there were speeches given. At least 125,000 people participated in the march and tens of thousands packed into Cobo Arena and the surrounding area to listen to the speeches.&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt;

=== Speeches ===

Many of the leaders of the march gave speeches. Albert Cleage, Walter Reuther, Mayor Cavanagh, former Governor Swainson, Congressman Charles Diggs, a representative of Governor Romney, Martin Luther King Jr., and others all gave speeches to the eager crowds.&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuther /&gt;&lt;ref name=Romney /&gt;    The speech spectators were looking forward to the most however was the one given by Martin Luther King Jr., and he obliged them by giving a speech that was as riveting as his speeches always were.

==== Martin Luther King Jrâs Speech ====

Some parts of his Detroit speech are similar to the one he gave in Washington. In particular, the end of his speech was a longer and more detailed version of the legendary "I Have a Dream" portion of his speech given two months later in Washington.&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt;

For comparison certain parts of both speeches are alternated below, given on the left is the speech in Detroit at the Walk to Freedom, and given on the right is the speech in Washington.

| "And so this afternoon, I have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream [â¦] I have a dream that one day, right down in Georgia and Mississippi and Alabama, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to live together as brothers. I have a dream this afternoon that one day, one day little white children and little Negro children will be able to join hands as brothers and sisters [â¦] I have a dream this afternoon that my four little children, that my four little children will not come up in the same young days that I came up within, but they will be judged on the basis of the content of their character, not the color of their skinâ¦ I have a dream this evening that one day we will recognize the words of Jefferson that "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and "every valley shall be exalted, and every hill shall be made low; the crooked places shall be made straight, and the rough places plain; and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together." [â¦] And with this faith I will go out and carve a tunnel of hope through the mountain of despair. With this faith, I will go out with you and transform dark yesterdays into bright tomorrows. With this faith, we will be able to achieve this new day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing with the Negroes in the spiritual of old: Free at last! Free at last! Thank God almighty, we are free at last!" &lt;ref name="Detroit Speech" /&gt;

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal." I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character [â¦] I have a dream that one day "every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low; the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together." [â¦] With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhoodâ¦ And when this happens, when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of Godâs children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!"&lt;ref name="Washington Speech" /&gt;

== Motown Records ==

One of the top record companies of the time, [[Motown]], had asked Martin Luther King Jr. if they could record some of his speeches.&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ward|first=Brian|title=Recording the Dream|year=1998|volume=48|issue=4|url=http://www.historytoday.com/brian-ward/recording-dream}}&lt;/ref&gt; They negotiated to record Kingâs speech after the Walk to Freedom when everyone gathered at Cobo Arena. King asked in the negotiations that the royalties from sales of the recording go not to him but to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt;  That selfless act left a deep impression on [[Berry Gordy]], the founder of Motown, who had been negotiating with King.&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt;

== Different Names ==

Governor George Romney officially had the day of the Walk to Freedom declared "Freedom March Day in Michigan".&lt;ref name=Garrett /&gt;  There are several different variations of the title "Walk to Freedom" that have been used. Locally in Detroit, it has been known by the title, Kingâs Walk on Woodward, and the Great March.&lt;ref name=Sugrue /&gt;   Other variations of the title that have been used include, Walk to Freedom March,&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt;  Great March/Walk to Freedom, Walk for/to Freedom, Detroit Freedom Walk/March,&lt;ref name=Garrett /&gt;  and Great March on Detroit.&lt;ref name="Washington Speech" /&gt;

== After the March ==

Although Governor Romney had sent representatives in his place to march in the Walk to Freedom, he wanted to do more than that. A few days after the march, he joined a group of hundreds through [[Grosse Pointe]], a wealthy suburb of Detroit, to advocate for civil rights.&lt;ref name=Romney /&gt;  He was also involved with other marches, rallies, and demonstrations in Michigan and knew Martin Luther King well.&lt;ref name=Romney /&gt; 
The Walk to Freedom, however, did not have the huge impact on Detroit and on civil rights that the March on Washington had and the Detroit Council for Human Rights (DCHR) did not last. The DCHR tried to start up a Northern Christian Leadership Conference as a companion to the SCLC, but disagreements, particularly between Franklin and Cleage, kept the idea from becoming a permanent reality.&lt;ref name="Freedom North" /&gt;   Albert Cleage eventually left the DCHR and it seems that other differences and disagreements caused the DCHR to dissolve.&lt;ref name="Freedom North" /&gt;

== Anniversary ==

To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Walk to Freedom a walk was held June 22 of 2013, organised by the Detroit branch of the NAACP and the United Auto Workers. Titled,"We Shall Not Default On Our Freedom!".&lt;ref name=Brand&gt;{{cite news|last=Brand-Williams|first=Oralandar|title=March to mark anniversary of MLK's 'Walk to Freedom'|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130226/METRO/302260349|accessdate=21 April 2013|newspaper=The Detroit News|date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thousands participated including Martin Luther King III, Detroit Mayor Dave Bing and the Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. Unlike 1963's walk's conclusion indoors, the 2013 version concluded at Hart Plaza. Detroit NAACP President Wendell Anthony said the march "signifies that the work for freedom and justice must continue" in Detroit and worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Martin Luther King's 1963 Detroit march remembered with walk|url=http://www.clickondetroit.com/community/martin-luther-kings-1963-detroit-march-remembered-with-walk|accessdate=13 July 2016|work=Click on Detroit|publisher=[[WDIV-TV]]|date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2468">[[Image:rock droppings.jpg|thumb|''Rock Drop'', by Drop Artists, 1962, (simulation)          Lawrence Kansas]]

In 1961, filmmaker [[Gene Bernofsky]] and artist [[Clark Richert]], art students from the [[University of Kansas]], developed an art concept they called '''Drop Art''' or '''droppings'''. Informed by the "[[happenings]]" of [[Allan Kaprow]] and the impromptu performances a few years earlier of [[John Cage]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Buckminster Fuller]] at [[Black Mountain College]], Drop Art began when Richert and Bernofsky started painting rocks and dropping them from a loft roof onto the sidewalk of Lawrence Kansas's main drag â watching the reactions of passersby. Early Drop Art included such pieces as ''Egg Drop'' and ''Pendulum'' (pictured) .

Drop Art eventually led to the creation of [[Drop City]], an experimental artist's community founded in 1965 near Trinidad, Colorado. The intention was to create a live-in work of Drop Art.

[[File:Modern Asia (1796).tif|thumb|upright=1.3|The Eastern world in a 1796 map, which included the continents of Asia and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] (then known as [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]).]]
The term '''Eastern world''' refers to various [[culture]]s or [[society|social structures]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] systems depending on the context, most often including at least part of [[Asia]] or geographically the countries and cultures east of Europe, the Mediterranean Region and [[Arab world]], specifically in historical ([[pre-modern]]) contexts, and in modern times in the context of [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = |author2=Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson|location = Boston, MA| id = 0-205-41365-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term is usually not used by people in this region itself, since this Eastern world is a varied, complex and dynamic region, hard to generalize, and although these countries and regions have many common threads running through them, historically they never needed to define themselves collectively against another entity, real or superficial.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Sandra S. Mouth, Joanna.  Barbara, Koening A. The Meanings of Race in the New Genomics: Implications for Health Disparities Research. Yale University. 2001. October 26, 2006. [http://www.yale.edu/yjhple/volume_1/pdf/033%20(koenig).pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101012859/http://www.yale.edu/yjhple/volume_1/pdf/033%20%28koenig%29.pdf |date=2006-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term originally had a literal geographic meaning, referring to the eastern part of the [[Old World]], contrasting the cultures and civilizations of Asia with those of Europe (the ''[[Occident]]'' or [[Western world]]). Traditionally, this includes all of [[Central Asia|Central]], [[North Asia|North]] and [[East Asia]] (the [[Far East]]), [[Greater Middle East]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]] (the [[Indian subcontinent]]). 

Conceptually, the boundary between east and west is cultural, rather than geographical, as a result of which [[Australia]] is typically grouped in the 
West, while [[Muslim world|Islamic nations]] and much of the former [[Soviet Union]] are, regardless of location, grouped in the East.&lt;ref name=Mestrovic&gt;{{cite book | last = MeÅ¡trovic | first = Stjepan | title = Balkanization of the West: The Confluence of Postmodernism and Postcommunism | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-203-34464-2 | page = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than [[Asia]] and some parts of [[Africa]], [[Europe]] has successfully absorbed almost all of the societies of Oceania, and the [[Americas]] into the [[Western world]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/culture_academic/fine_arts.html |title=Embassy of Brazil - Ottawa |publisher=Brasembottawa.org |accessdate=2011-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429013145/http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/culture_academic/fine_arts.html |archivedate=2011-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Falcoff |first=Mark |url=http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.11413/pub_detail.asp |title=Chile Moves On |publisher=AEI |accessdate=2011-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417075124/http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.11413/pub_detail.asp |archivedate=2009-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turkey]], the [[Philippines]],

== Identity politics ==

=== Asian concepts ===
{{cleanup|reason=The first paragraph in this section uses English words, but does not manage to make coherent English sentences. The second paragraph is mostly one run-on sentence.|date=April 2018}}
[[File:LocationAsia.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|An image of the "Eastern world" defined as [[Asia]]]]
Although the concept of a united Asian people and not mean [[Asian people|Asian race]] is even more debatable due to the fact that most of the world link the identity of Asian only to the people of South, East and Southeast Asia and so regions like [[Western Asia]] that who even though see themselves as part of the Eastern world such as the [[Arab world|Arab nations]] of Western Asia, [[Israel]], [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], and the ethnic groups that come along with these countries do not identify as Asian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Khatib | first = Lina | title = Filming the modern Middle East: politics in the cinemas of Hollywood and the Arab world | volume = 57 | series = Library of Modern Middle East Studies, Library of International Relations | publisher = [[I.B. Tauris]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-84511-191-5 | pages = 166â167, 173}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another reason why a [[Pan-Asianism|Pan-Asian]] identity is a flawed work in progress concept compared to the mass unity found in the continents of Europe and Africa is the fact that Asia is the most racially and ethnically diverse continent in the world&lt;ref&gt;Cartmill, M. (1999). The Status of the Race Concept in Physical Anthropology. American Anthropologist 100(3)651 -660.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, "Asian and Indian people" are referred to in the New Zealand Heart Foundation's [http://www.pickthetick.org.nz/bmi/ BMI calculator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531222922/http://www.pickthetick.org.nz/bmi/ |date=2009-05-31 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; that differs very widely among and within its regions with many different cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems whose people have an even further pan-continental belief of [[Nationalism|nationalistic]], cultural, and [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic individualism]] many of whom believe came out of the imperialistic colonization of the continent by foreign Western powers back in [[colonialism|colonial times]] and because of this overt sense individualism across the continent once a specific group(s) is labeled something many groups within Asia will have a hard time identifying with the same label. Most of the people of Asia prefer to identify with their individual nations rather than with their continent, region, or each other and these attitudes can be found throughout the continent.

The division between 'East' and 'West' is a product of European cultural history, and of the distinction between European [[Christendom]] and the cultures beyond it to the East. With the [[European colonization of the Americas]] the East/West distinction became global. The concept of an Eastern, "Indian" ([[Indies]]) or "[[Oriental]]" sphere was emphasized by ideas of racial as well as religious and cultural differences. Such distinctions were articulated by Westerners in the scholarly tradition known as Orientalism and [[Indology]]. An intriguing fact to be noted is that [[Orientalism]] has been the only Western concept that was about a unified Eastern world and not about any specific region(s), but rather all of Asia together.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;from the Latin ''oriens''; ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European concepts ===
During the [[Cold War]], the term "Eastern world" was sometimes used as an extension of [[Eastern bloc]], connoting the [[Soviet Union]], [[China]] and their [[communist]] allies, while the term "Western world" often connoted the [[United States]] and its [[NATO]] allies such as the [[United Kingdom]].

The concept is often another term for the [[Far East]] â a region that bears considerable cultural and religious commonality. Eastern philosophy, art, literature, and other traditions, are often found throughout the region in places of high importance, such as popular culture, architecture and traditional literature. The spread of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Yoga]] is partly responsible for this.

{{Easternculture}}
Eastern culture has developed many themes and traditions. Some important ones are:

* [[Abrahamic religions]] (a.k.a. [[Abrahamic religions|West Asian religions]]) 
** [[Christianity]] â the majority of the modern world adheres to this faith although it isn't widely practiced in its native continent of Asia anymore and since the faith had spread to the [[Western World]] the notion of "Europe" and the "Western World" has been intimately connected with the concept of "[[Christendom|Christianity and Christendom]]" many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified European identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=9780813216836|edition=reprint|author2=Glenn Olsen|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, vibrant indigenous minorities in the [[Levant]] have preserved their ancient beliefs, adhering to [[Syriac Christianity]] (i.e. [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] and [[Maronite people]]), an [[Eastern Christian]] sect.
** [[Islam]] â the majority of the world [[Muslim]] population have always lived in Asia, due to Islam spreading and becoming the dominant religion of these areas.
** [[Judaism]] â the national religion of the [[Israelites]]/[[Hebrews]] of the [[Fertile Crescent]], or what is now [[Israel]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], and [[Lebanon]]. They eventually evolved into the [[Jews]] (particularly [[Ashkenazi]], [[Sephardic]], [[Mizrahi]]) and [[Samaritans]] of today.
* [[Zoroastrianism]] â the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[state religion]] of [[Sassanid Persia|Sassanid Iran]]
* [[Eastern religions]] / [[Eastern philosophy]]
** [[Indian religions]]
*** [[Buddhism]] â the path of liberation attained through insight into the ultimate nature of reality.
*** [[Hinduism]] 
*** [[Jainism]]
*** [[Sikhism]] â a religion that developed in the warring plains of [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in an atmosphere of ideological clash between [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]]. Its followers retain spiritual as well as martial qualities.
** [[East Asian religions|Taoic religions]] (a.k.a. [[East Asian religions]] or [[East Asian religions|Far Eastern religions]])
*** [[Chinese folk religion]]
*** [[Confucianism]] â the belief that human beings are teachable, improvable and perfectible through personal and communal endeavour especially including self-cultivation and self-creation.

In psychology, '''emotional safety''' refers to an emotional state achieved in [[Attachment (psychology)|attachment relationships]] wherein each individual is open and vulnerable. The concept is primarily used by [[relationship counseling|couples' therapists]] to describe [[intimate relationships]]. When a relationship is emotionally safe, the partners trust each other and routinely give each other the benefit of the doubt in questionable situations. When emotional safety is lost, the partners are inclined to be distrustful, looking for possible hidden meanings and potential threats in each other's words and behaviors.

==Origins==
The emotional safety model of couples therapy was developed by psychologist Don R. Catherall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Catherall|first=Don R.|title=Emotional Safety: viewing couples through the lens of affect|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-95451-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model focuses on the two realms of "attachment" and "esteem", contending that each partner measures his safety by his perception of the other partner's feelings in these two realms. If each perceives the other partner to be securely attached and each holds the other high regard, they feel emotionally safe. But if one perceives threat in either realm, then he or she will lose emotional safety and may react. If he or she reacts in a negative fashion (usually by either attacking or distancing from the partner), then said reaction can constitute a threat to the other partner's emotional safety. If the other partner responds in a similarly negative fashion, a vicious cycle may begin in which each partner's reaction to a perceived threat creates a reciprocal threat to the other partner. Once caught in these cycles, partners have considerable difficulty re-achieving emotional safety.

==Evidence==
Research on couples has identified a sudden, abrupt shift in physiological functioning (the [[fight-or-flight response]]) that occurs when a partner suddenly perceives something amiss in the intimate relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottman|first=John M.|title=The Marriage Clinic: a scientifically-based marital therapy|year=1999|publisher=W. W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=0-393-70282-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the emotional safety model contend that these shifts are precipitated by a partner's perception of change in the other's [[affective]] tone regarding their emotional relationship (i.e. the partners' feelings about themselves, each other, and their relationship).

==Theoretical foundation==
The emotional safety model utilizes the [[affect theory]] of [[Silvan Tomkins]] to explain the ways in which partners influence each other through their affective tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tomkins|first=Silvan S.|title=Affect, Imagery, Consciousness: The Complete Edition, Volumes III and Volume IV|year=2008|publisher=Springer Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-082614404-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tomkins|first=Silvan S.|title=Volume III, the negative effects: anger and fear. Volume IV, cognition: duplication and transformation of information.|year=2008|publisher=Springer|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-082614406-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment is based on attachment relationships as identified by [[John Bowlby]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowlby|first=John|title=Attachment and Loss, Volume I: Attachment|year=1969|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-465-09715-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowlby|first=John|title=Attachment and Loss, Volume II: Separation|year=1973|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-1402-1870X}}&lt;/ref&gt; while esteem is based on [[Nathaniel Branden]]'s work on self-esteem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Branden|first=Nathaniel|title=Honoring the Self: Self-esteem and Personal Transformation|year=1985|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=0-553-26814-7|edition=Bantam}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Donald Nathanson's work on [[shame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nathanson|first=Donald L.|title=Shame and pride: affect, sex, and the birth of the self|year=1992|publisher=Norton|location=New York|isbn=0-393-03097-0|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
The emotional safety model differs from other models of couples' therapy in its emphasis on each partner's perception of the other's feelings regarding the emotional relationship. The model emphasizes that each partner has more influence on the ''other'' partner's state of emotional safety than on their own, which can lead to an impasse referred to as the "couple's conundrum"; i.e. the couple remains stuck because each partner needs to feel safe before they can make themselves vulnerable and take the appropriate steps to make the other partner feel safe.

{{Unbalanced|date=May 2018}}'''Environmental racism''' is a term used to describe environmental injustice that occurs in practice and in policy within a racialized context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bullard|first=Robert D.|date=2001|title=Environmental Justice in the 21st Century: Race Still Matters|journal=Phylon (1960-)|volume=49|issue=3/4|pages=151â171|doi=10.2307/3132626|jstor=3132626}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1982, the term was coined by [[Benjamin Chavis]], who was the then executive director of the United Church of Christ (UCC) Commission for Racial Justice, in response to the dumping of hazardous PCB waste in a town in Warren County, North Carolina. The UCC and US General Accounting Office (GAO) reports on this case in NC brought public attention to the strong association between locations of hazardous waste sites and poor minority neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Early activists in environmental racism, Chavis and [[Robert D. Bullard|Robert Bullard]] pointed out institutionalized racism stemming from government and corporate policies that led to environmental racism. Practices like redlining, zoning, and colorblind adaptation planning,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardy|first=Dean|last2=Milligan|first2=Richard|last3=Heynen|first3=Nik|date=2017|title=Racial coastal formation: The environmental injustice of colorblind adaptation planning for sea-level rise.|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718517302944|journal=Geoforum|volume=87|pages=62â72|via=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2017.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and factors that inhibit residents from preventing these practices include their low socioeconomic status, and lack of political representation and mobility that all contribute to environmental racism.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Rozelia|date=1998|title=An Examination of International Environmental Racism Through the Lens of Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes|url=http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/ijgls/vol5/iss2/14|journal=Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies|volume=5|pages=|via=Jerome Hall Law Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohai|first=Paul|author2=Pellow, David|author3=Roberts, J. Timmons|year=2009|title=Environmental Justice|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|volume=34|pages=405â430|doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-082508-094348}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Environmental racism can be explained through a number of ways and in most cases usually include four unique patterns. The first one includes exposure to hazardous waste. It can also be identified by determining how vulnerable a community is to issues like flooding. The accessibility of potable water can also help in measuring environmental justice. Finally, a discriminatory waste management program can also be considered a case of environmental injustice. Some social scientists have argued that some causes of environmental racism are intentional, for example, the dumping of hazardous waste in a minority community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chae|first=David H.|date=2018|title=Area racism and birth outcomes among Blacks in the United States.|url=|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=199|pages=49â55|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Â  Apart from intentional reasons, this kind of racism can also be caused by structural and institutional elements. Chavis defined environmental racism in five categories. First, he termed it as racial discrimination in defining environmental policies. He also stated that this occurs when these regulations and laws are being enforced. He further stated that it is the deliberate targeting of communities of color as far as dumping of toxic waste is concerned. He also referred to this term as the official sanctioning of dangerous poisons and pollutants in the minority communities. Finally, he termed it as the history of exclusion of people of color from attaining leadership positions in the ecological organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Urban Geography|last=Holifield|first=Ryan|publisher=V. H. Winston &amp; Son, Inc.|year=2001|isbn=|location=Milwaukee|pages=78â90|chapter=Defining Environmental Justice and Environmental Racism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;Â  Other activists like Robert Bullard also had their own definition for the term claiming that it refers to any policy or directive that differentially harms people, groups, or even communities based on their color. 

It is also important to understand the factors that can lead to environmental racism and social scientists have identified the four main ones. They include cheap land, the absence of political authority, lack of mobility, and lastly poverty. While corporations can obtain land cheaply because of economic reasons, they can also do that because a community lacks the power to fight such companies. It is also a known fact that minority communities lack political power and this has often worked to their disadvantage. Businesses know that they can do anything in such places without any meaningful resistance. It is worth noting that politicians and lawmakers are very selective on whom they represent, and these are some of the elements that have harmed these communities. Corporations also take advantage of the lack of mobility of these people and pay them minimum wages to limit their mobility even further.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=&lt;!--editorial:no byline--&gt;|date=2018|title=Environmental racism: time to tackle social injustice.|url=|journal=The Lancet Planetary Health|volume=2|issue=11|pages=e462|via=|pmid=30396431|doi=10.1016/S2542-5196(18)30219-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;Â  It should be noted that the impoverished nature of these communities contributes to all the above factors because without money people cannot act either physically or politically.

The acknowledgement of environmental racism prompted the [[environmental justice]] social movement that began in the 1970s and 1980s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melosi|first=Martin|title=Equity, eco-racism and environmental history|journal=Environmental History Review |year=1995 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=1â16 |doi=10.2307/3984909 |jstor=3984909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although environmental racism has been historically tied to the environmental justice movement, throughout the years the term has dissociated more and more from the environmental justice movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ulezaka, Tara. Race and Waste: The Quest for Environmental Justice. Temple Journal of Science Technology &amp; Environmental Law.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to cases of environmental racism, grassroots organizations and campaigns have brought more attention to environmental racism in policy making and emphasize the importance of having input from minorities in policy making.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although environmental racism was coined in the US, it also occurs on the international level. Examples include the exportation of hazardous wastes to poor countries in the [[Global South]] with lax environmental policies and safety practices ([[pollution haven]]s).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Marginalized communities that do not have the socioeconomic and political means to oppose large corporations are at risk to environmentally racist practices that are detrimental and sometimes fatal to humans.Economic statuses and political positions are crucial factors when looking at environmental problems because they determine where a person lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dicochea|first=Perlita R.|date=2012|title=Discourses of Race &amp; Racism within Environmental Justice Studies: An Eco-Racial Intervention|url=|journal=Ethnicity and Race in a Changing World|volume=3|issue=2|pages=18â29|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who do not have those privileges are usually the ones who suffer from environmental problems.    

Environmental racism crosses boundaries of countries and is addressed below in the context of environmental racism that has occurred outside of the US, where the term was coined.

== Background ==
In the United States, the first report to draw a relationship between race, income, and risk of exposure to pollutants was the Council of Environmental Quality's "Annual Report to the President" in 1971, in response to toxic waste dumping in an African American community in Warren County, NC.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;United States of America. Environmental Justice Group. National Conference of State Legislatures. Environmental Justice: A Matter of Perspective. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  After protests in [[Warren County, North Carolina]], the U.S. [[General Accounting Office]] (GAO) issued a report on the case in 1983, and the [[United Church of Christ]] (UCC) commissioned a report exploring the concept in 1987 drawing a connection between race and the placement of the hazardous waste facilities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[Benjamin Chavis|Chavis, Jr., Benjamin F.]], and Charles Lee, "Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States," United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Office|first=U.S. Government Accountability|date=1983-06-14|title=Siting of Hazardous Waste Landfills and Their Correlation With Racial and Economic Status of Surrounding Communities|url=https://www.gao.gov/products/RCED-83-168|issue=RCED-83-168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perez|first=Alejandro|last2=Grafton|first2=Bernadette|last3=Mohai|first3=Paul|last4=Harden|first4=Rebecca|last5=Hintzen|first5=Katy|last6=Orvis|first6=Sara|date=October 2015|title=Evolution of the environmental justice movement: activism, formalization and differentiation|journal=Environmental Research Letters|volume=10|issue=10|pages=105002|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/10/10/105002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the outcry in Warren County was an important event in spurring minority, grassroots involvement in the [[environmental justice]] movement by addressing cases of environmental racism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One activist, [[Benjamin Chavis]], who at the time was the executive director of the Commission for Racial Justice of the United Church of Christ coined the term ''environmental racism'' 1982 in response to the case.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

From the groundbreaking reports on environmental racism in Warren County, NC, the accumulation of studies and reports on cases of environmental racism and injustices garnered increased public attention in the US, and eventually led to President Bill Clinton's 1994 [[Pollution_in_the_United_States#Executive_Order_12898|Executive Order 12898]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1994|title=Presidential Documents|url=https://www.archives.gov/files/federal-register/executive-orders/pdf/12898.pdf|journal=Federal Register|volume=|pages=|via=National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This was a historical step in addressing environmental injustice on a policy level, especially within a predominantly white-dominated environmentalism movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/environmentalisms-racist-history|title=Environmentalismâs Racist History|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental racism was coined in the US but also exists on an international scale between countries in the [[NorthâSouth divide|Global North]] and [[Global South]], and between different races and ethnicities on different continents. Corporations in the Global North often produce dangerous chemicals banned in the United States and export them to developing countries, or send waste materials to countries with less stringent environmental laws.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Grossman, Elizabeth, ''High Tech Trash: Digital Devices, Hidden Toxics, and Human Health'' (Washington: Island Press, 2006), 185.&lt;/ref&gt; While the US approach to environmental racism emphasizes race-based discrimination and structures policies to provide equal treatment, the European approach to environmental racism focuses on changing the social conditions that result in inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-09-15|title=Issues in environmental justice within the European Union|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800911002722|journal=Ecological Economics|language=en|volume=70|issue=11|pages=1846â1853|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.06.025|issn=0921-8009|last1=Laurent|first1=Ãloi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

====Cost-benefit analysis ====
[[Cost-benefit analysis]] (CBA) is a process that places a monetary value on costs and benefits to evaluate issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.worldbank.org/2C1D1VKF80 "Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)"], World Bank Group. n.d. Accessed: November 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Environmental CBA aims to provide policy solutions for intangible products such as clean air and water by measuring a consumer's willingness to pay for these goods.  CBA contributes to environmental racism through the valuing of environmental resources based on their utility to society.  The more someone is willing to pay for a resource such as clean water or air benefits society more than when people are not willing to pay for these goods.  This creates a burden on poorer areas, however, by relocating toxic wastes and other environmentally hazardous goods through the justification that they are not willing (or able) to pay as much as a wealthier area for a clean environment.  The placement of toxic wastes near poor people lowers the property value of already cheap land.  Since the decrease in property value is less than that of a cleaner, wealthier area the monetary benefits to society are greater by dumping the toxic waste in a "low-value" area.&lt;ref&gt;Westra, Laura, and Bill E. Lawson. ''Faces of Environmental Racism: Confronting Issues of Global Justice''. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Definition===

[[Benjamin Chavis|Chavis]] defined the term as "racial discrimination in environmental policy making, the enforcement of regulations and laws, the deliberate targeting of communities of color for toxic waste facilities, the official sanctioning of the life-threatening presence of poisons and pollutants in our communities, and the history of excluding people of color from leadership of the ecology movements."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Expanding the definition in "The Legacy of American Apartheid and Environmental Racism," [[Robert D. Bullard|Robert Bullard]] describes the environmental racism "refers to any policy, practice, or directive that differentially affects or disadvantages (whether intended or unintended) individuals, groups, or communities based on race or color."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bullard|first=Robert|date=Spring 1994|title=The Legacy of American Apartheid and Environmental Racism|url=https://scholarship.law.stjohns.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1460&amp;context=jcred|journal=Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development|volume=9|pages=|via=St. John's University School of Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four unique patterns that help identify and measure environmental injustice. Exposure to hazardous waste, how vulnerable a community is to flooding, how accessible potable water is, and discriminatory waste management processes.&lt;ref&gt;https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1004&amp;context=anthro_faculty_pubs&lt;/ref&gt;

While some social scientists view the siting of hazardous facilities in minority communities as a demonstration of intentional racism,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Saha, Robin. 2010. "Environmental Racism". In ''Encyclopedia of Geography'', ed. Barney Warf, Sage Publications, {{DOI|10.4135/9781412939591.n379}}&lt;/ref&gt; others view the causes of environmental racism as structural and institutional.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

There are four factors leading to environmental racism: cheap land, lack of political power, lack of mobility, and finally poverty. First, cheap land is sought for economic reasons but cheap land can also be found due to lack of power in the community to resist the corporation. Second, the lack of political power carried by poor minority groups allow businesses to act with little to no resistance. Politicians and lawmakers are able to better understand communities that have the resources to make their beliefs known, unlike impoverished minority communities. Third, the lack of mobility provides a stream of workers who can be paid minimum wage and thus do not have the funds to leave the now hazardous community. Finally, the overall communities lack of money contributes to all the factors listed above and overall reduces the communities ability to act both physically and politically.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1138&amp;context=ijgls&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases of Environmental Racism by Location==

=== North America ===
In the United States, correlation between the sites of hazardous waste facilities and low-income and minority communities was publicly addressed in the 1983 [[U.S. Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) report in response to the Warren County, NC protests.&lt;ref name="gao"&gt;[http://archive.gao.gov/d48t13/121648.pdf GAO. 1983. "Siting of Hazardous Waste Landfills and Their Correlation with Racial and Economic Status of Surrounding Communities"], [[U.S. Government Accountability Office]], Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Minority communities do not have the financial means, resources, and political representation to oppose hazardous waste sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colquette | first1 = Kelly Michele | last2 = Henry Robertson | first2 = Elizabeth A. | year = 1991 | title = Environmental Racism: The Causes, Consequences, and Commendations | url = | journal = Tulane Environmental Law Journal | volume = 5 | issue = 1| page = 168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also may depend on the economic opportunities the site brings and are reluctant to oppose its location at the risk of their health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, controversial projects are less likely to be sited in non-minority areas that are expected to pursue [[collective action]] and succeed in opposing the siting of hazardous waste sites and sewage treatment facilities in their area.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher M. 1995. Environmental Racism Claims brought under the Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant, Bunyan 1995"&gt;Bryant, Bunyan. "Introduction." ''Environmental justice issues, policies, and solutions''. Washington, D.C: Island, 1995. 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Processes such as [[suburbanization]], [[gentrification]], and decentralization lead to patterns of environmental racism. For example, the process of suburbanization (or [[white flight]]) consists of non-minorities leaving industrial zones for safer, cleaner, and less expensive suburban locales. Meanwhile, minority communities are left in the inner cities and in close proximity to polluted industrial zones. In these areas, unemployment is high and businesses are less likely to invest in area improvement, creating poor economic conditions for residents and reinforcing a social formation that reproduces racial inequality.&lt;ref name="pulido12"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pulido|first=Laura|year=2000|title=Rethinking Environmental Racism: White Privilege and Urban Development in Southern California|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=90|issue=1|pages=12â40|doi=10.1111/0004-5608.00182|hdl=10214/1833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the poverty of property owners and residents in a municipality may be taken into consideration by hazardous waste facility developers since areas with depressed real estate values will cut expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Colquette and Robertson, 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the placement of hazardous waste facilities, minority populations experience greater exposure to harmful chemicals and suffer from health outcomes that affect their ability at work and in schools. A comprehensive study of particulate emissions across the United States, published in 2018, found that Blacks were exposed to 54% more particulate matter emissions (soot) than the average American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mikati|first=Ihab|author2=Adam F.

The [[United States Army]] encouraged these [[Bison hunting#19th century bison hunts and near extinction|massive hunts]] to force Native Americans off their traditional lands and into reservations further west.|260x260px]]
The [[Indian Removal Act of 1830]] and the [[Trail of Tears]] may be considered early examples of environmental racism in the United States. By 1850, all tribes east of the Mississippi had been removed to western lands, essentially confining them to "lands that were too dry, remote, or barren to attract the attention of settlers and corporations".&lt;ref name="ibid"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hooks|first1=Gregory|last2=Smith|first2=Chad L.|year=2004|title=The Treadmill of Destruction: National Sacrifice Areas and Native Americans|url=|journal=[[American Sociological Review]]|volume=69|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, during World War II, military facilities were often located conterminous to reservations, leading to a situation in which "a disproportionate number of the most dangerous military facilities are located near Native American lands".&lt;ref name="ibid" /&gt;

More recently, Native American lands have been used for waste disposal and illegal dumping by the US and multinational corporations.&lt;ref name="Goldtooth, Tom 1995"&gt;Goldtooth, Tom.

An ongoing issue for Native Americans activists is the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]]. The pipeline would start in North Dakota and travel to Illinois. Although it does not cross directly on a reservation, the pipeline is under scrutiny because it passes under a section of the Missouri river which is a key water source for Native American tribes including the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declared the PCBs a threat to public health and required the state to remove the polluted waste. In 1979, the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources and EPA Region 4 selected Warren County as the site to deposit the PCB-contaminated soil that was collected from the roadsides.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt; Warren County is one of the six counties along the "black belt" of North Carolina. The counties residing in the "black belt" are significantly poorer than the rest of the state.

====Homer, Forest Grove, and Center Springs, Louisiana ====

In 1989, the Louisiana Energy Services (LES), a British, German and American conglomerate, conducted a nationwide search to find the "best" site to build a privately owned uranium enrichment plant. The LES claimed to use an objective scientific method to select Louisiana as the "best" place to build the plant. In response to the selection, the communities of Homer, Forest Grove and Center Springs that are nearby the proposed site formed a group called Citizens against Nuclear Trash (CANT). With the help of the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund (later changed to Earth Justice Legal Defense Fund), CANT sued LES for practicing environmental racism. Finally after 8 years, on May 1, 1997, a three-judge panel of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board made their final initial decision. The panel found that racial bias did play a role in the selection process. In response to the victory, on May 11, 1997, the London Times declared, "Louisiana Blacks Win Nuclear War." The courts decision was also upheld on appeal on April 4, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bullard|first1=Robert|date=September 2001|title=Confronting Environmental Racism in the 21st Century}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flint, Michigan====
{{main article|Flint water crisis}}
Since April 2014, residents of [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], a city that is almost 57 percent black and notably impoverished, have been drinking and bathing in water that contains enough lead to meet the Environmental Protection Agency's definition of "toxic waste".  Before 2014 when the city of Flint switched to their own river as means of water, Lake Huron provided the area with water. Researchers at Virginia Tech discovered in 2015 that the [[Flint River (Michigan)|Flint River]] is 19 times more corrosive than Lake Huron. Lead contamination can engender multiple health conditions. A November 2015 class-action lawsuit describes how Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) failed to treat the new water source with an anti-corrosive agent, thereby causing the water to become increasingly discolored. This was in violation of the Lead and Copper Rule and MDEQ did not correctly complete the Safe Drinking Water Act mandated lead assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Venkataraman|first=Bhawani|date=2017-12-29|title=The Paradox of Water and the Flint Crisis|journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development|language=en|volume=60|issue=1|pages=4â17|doi=10.1080/00139157.2018.1397466|issn=0013-9157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding that agent (orthophosphate) would have cost $100 per day, according to CNN, and 90 percent of the problems with Flint's water would have been averted if it had been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/racist-roots-of-flints-water-crisis_us_56b12953e4b04f9b57d7b118|title=The Racist Roots Of Flint's Water Crisis|last1=Craven|first1=Julia|date=2016-02-03|newspaper=Huffington Post|accessdate=8 November 2016|last2=Tynes|first2=Tyler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the consumption of Lead is considered among the environmental problems and some of the ways people can be exposed to it is from the corrosion of old pipes, the dust from lead-based paint and gasoline has metal dust which contains lead; but the amount of lead in gasoline has been reduced and this contributed a lot when it comes to Lead exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macey|first=Gregg P.|date=2001|title=An Investigation of Environmental Racism Claims: Testing Environmental Management Approaches with a Geographic Information System|url=|journal=Environmental Management|volume=27|issue=6|pages=893â907|via=ProQuest|pmid=11393323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an official investigation was conducted, Michigan's attorney general Bill Schuette initially filed charges against three government officials: two state officials of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, Michael Prysby and Stephen Busch, and a Flint city employee, Michael Glasglow, who was the city's water quality supervisor.

==== Wilmington, North Carolina ====
North Carolina is home to 31 coal ash pits that store an expected 111 million tons of harmful waste created by coal-fired power plants. It is also home to many excrement pits, referred to indirectly as "lagoons," that store roughly 10 billion pounds of wet waste created every year by swine, poultry, and dairy cattle in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2018/09/13/Heres-a-Hurricane-Florence-environmental-justice-story-that-media-outlets-need-to-tell/221293|title=Here's a Hurricane Florence environmental justice story that media outlets need to tell|date=2018-09-12|work=Media Matters for America|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Carolina's mechanical hog tasks are firmly grouped in a couple of districts on the beach front plain that housed the most subjugated individuals preceding the Civil War.

Wilmington, NC is usually one of the first cities hit by hurricanes off the Atlantic coast, and its environmental risks are increased by its proximity to hog farms, nuclear reactors, and coal-ash pitsâone of which has already spilled over, due to Hurricane Florence in September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2018/09/mapping-where-environmental-justice-is-most-threatened-in-the-carolinas/570985/|title=8 Places That Provide a Roadmap for Fighting for Environmental Justice|work=CityLab|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hog waste spills can be destructive to the individuals who live close to these pits and farms and a significant number of the neighbors are low-income ethnic minorities. African Americans have been battling for their justice in the port city. This can be traced to the Wilmington Rebellion of 1898, when whites stripped away black individuals' rights to cast a ballot and hold office through the power of force, in spite of the significant role African Americans play in building the greater part of the city's monuments. In 1971, racial strains over the absence of protection for African Americans in the threatening integration endeavors prompted a mob and resulted in the capture of several black activists who would later be known as the "Wilmington Ten." One of those activists, [[Benjamin Chavis]], would later turn into a significant figure in the environmental justice movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2018/09/mapping-where-environmental-justice-is-most-threatened-in-the-carolinas/570985/|title=8 Places That Provide a Roadmap for Fighting for Environmental Justice|work=CityLab|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two studies of disease transmission analysts conducted at the University of North Carolina at Sanctuary Slope distributed a paper in 2014 titled: "Industrial Hog Operations in North Carolina Excessively Effect African-Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wing|first=Steve|date=2014|title=Industrial Hog Operations in North Carolina Disproportionately Impact African-Americans, Hispanics and American Indians|url=http://www.ncpolicywatch.com/wpcontent/uploads/2014/09/UNC-Report.pdf|journal=UNC Report|volume=|pages=|via=NC Policy Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; They expressed, "Flood of waste pits amid overwhelming precipitation occasions results in gigantic spills of animal waste into neighboring networks and conduits."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2018/09/13/Heres-a-Hurricane-Florence-environmental-justice-story-that-media-outlets-need-to-tell/221293|title=Here's a Hurricane Florence environmental justice story that media outlets need to tell|date=2018-09-12|work=Media Matters for America|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exporting toxic wastes to countries in the Global South is one form of environmental racism that occurs on an international basis. In one alleged instance, the French aircraft carrier [[Clemenceau (R 98)|Clemenceau]] was prohibited from entering [[Alang]], an [[India]]n ship-breaking yard, due to a lack of clear documentation about its toxic contents. French President [[Jacques Chirac]] ultimately ordered the carrier, which contained tons of hazardous materials including [[asbestos]] and [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s, to return to [[France]].&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ahmed |first=Zubair |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4588922.stm |title=Stay out, India tells toxic ship |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-01-06 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their lack of environmental laws, emerging countries like [[Ecuador]] have been subjected to environmental pollution, sometimes causing health problems, loss of agriculture, and poverty. In 1993, 30,000 Ecuadorians, which included [[Cofan]], Siona, [[Huaorani]], and Quichua indigenous people, filed a lawsuit against [[Texaco|Texaco oil company]] for the environmental damages caused by oil extraction activities in the [[Lago Agrio oil field]]. After handing control of the oil fields to an Ecuadorian oil company, Texaco did not properly dispose of its hazardous waste, causing great damages to the ecosystem and crippling communities.&lt;ref&gt;Copland, Liesl; Kamen, Jon; Berlinger, Joe. 2009.

{{see|Environmental issues in the Niger Delta}}
In Nigeria, near the [[Niger Delta]], cases of [[oil spill]]s, burning of [[toxic waste]], and urban [[air pollution]] are problems in more developed areas. In the early 1990s, Nigeria was among the 50 nations with the world's highest levels of [[carbon dioxide emissions]], which totaled 96,500 kilotons, a per capita level of 0.84 metric tons. The UN reported in 2008 that carbon dioxide emissions in Nigeria totaled 95,194 kilotons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gall|first1=Timothy|last2=Derek|first2=Gleason|title=Worldmark Encyclopedia of the Nations|date=2012|publisher=Gale, Cengage Learning|location=Detroit|page=545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous webpages were created in support of the [[Ogoni people]], who are indigenous to Nigeria's oil-rich Delta region. Sites were used to protest the disastrous environmental and economic effects of [[Shell Oil]] drilling, to urge the boycotting of Shell Oil, and to denounce [[human rights abuse]]s by the Nigerian government and by Shell. The use of the Internet in formulating an international appeal intensified dramatically after the Nigerian government's November 1995 execution of nine Ogoni activists, including [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]], who was one of the founders of the nonviolent Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spitulnik|first1=Debra|title=Small Media Against Big Oil (Nigeria)|date=2011|publisher=Thousand Oaks: SAGE Publications, Inc.|page=459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Addressing environmental racism==
Environmental Racism can be traced back around 500 years with the arrival of the Europeans and their displacement of Native Americans. Â The [[Environmental justice|Environmental Justice Movement]], however, seems to be fairly recent having been rooted around the same time as the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]]. Â The Civil Rights Movement influenced the mobilization of people by echoing the empowerment and concern associated with political action&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=R6rj8XMSjx4C&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=environmental+racism+outrage#v=onepage&amp;q=environmental%20racism%20outrage&amp;f=false|title=From the Ground Up: Environmental Racism and the Rise of the Environmental Justice Movement|last=Cole|first=Luke W.|last2=Foster|first2=Sheila R.|date=2001|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814715376|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Â Here is where the civil rights agenda and the environmental agenda met.  Despite this being the case, environmental organizations such as [[Sierra Club]] did distance themselves from cases such as the Warren County case likely because of their unwillingness to risk technical support when dealing with a very social issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGurty|first=Eileen Maura|date=1997|title=From NIMBY to Civil Rights: The Origins of the Environmental Justice Movement|journal=Environmental History|volume=2|issue=3|pages=301â323|doi=10.2307/3985352|jstor=3985352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(5-16 June 1972). "Rio Declaration on Environment and Development", United Nations Environment Programme].&lt;/ref&gt; Under this principle, the initiator of the potentially hazardous activity is charged with demonstrating the activity's safety. Environmental justice activists also emphasize the need for waste reduction in general, which would act to reduce the overall burden.&lt;ref name="withered" /&gt;

Concentrations of ethnic or racial minorities may also foster solidarity, lending support in spite of challenges and providing the concentration of [[social capital]] necessary for grassroots activism. Citizens who are tired of being subjected to the dangers of pollution in their communities have been confronting the power structures through organized protest, legal actions, marches, civil disobedience, and other activities.&lt;ref name="Weintraub, I 1994"&gt;Weintraub, I. 1994.

Racial minorities are often excluded from politics and urban planning (such as sea-level rise adaptation planning) so various perspectives of an issue are not included in policy making that may affect these excluded groups in the future.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In general, political participation in African American communities is correlated with the reduction of health risks and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gee | first1 = Gilbert C. | last2 = Payne-Sturges | first2 = Devon C. | year = 2004 | title = Environmental Health Disparities: A Framework Integrating Psychosocial and Environmental Concepts | url = | journal = [[Environmental Health Perspectives]] | volume = 112 | issue = 17 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.7074 | pmid = 15579407 | pmc = 1253653 | pages=1645â1653}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other strategies in battling against large companies include public hearings, the elections of supporters to state and local offices, meetings with company representatives, and other efforts to bring about public awareness and accountability.&lt;ref&gt;Bullard, Robert D. 1990.

In addressing this global issue, activists take to various social media platforms to both raise awareness and call to action. Â The mobilization and communication between the intersectional grassroots movements where race and environmental imbalance meet has proven to be effective. The movement gained traction with the help of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat among other platforms. Â Celebrities such as [[Shailene Woodley|Shailene Woodley]], who advocated against the [[Keystone XL pipeline|Keystone XL Pipeline]], have shared their experiences including that of being arrested for protesting.

===Studies===
Studies have been important in drawing associations and public attention by exposing practices that cause marginalized communities to be more vulnerable to environmental health hazards. The US GAO study in response to the 1982 protests against the PCB landfill in Warren County was among the first groundbreaking studies that drew correlations between the racial and economic background of communities and the location of hazardous waste facilities. Their study, "Siting of Hazardous Waste Landfills and Their Correlation with Racial and Economic Status of Surrounding Communities," revealed that "three of the four commercial hazardous waste landfills in the Southeast United States were located in majority black communities." However, the study was limited in scope by only focusing on off-site hazardous waste landfills in the Southeastern United States.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Colquette and Robertson, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this limitation the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice, or CRJ, directed a comprehensive national study on demographic patterns associated with the location of hazardous waste sites.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; The CRJ national study conducted two examinations of areas surrounding commercial hazardous waste facilities and the location of uncontrolled toxic waste sites.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; The first study examined the association between race and socio-economic status and the location of commercial hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; After statistical analysis, the first study concluded that "the percentage of community residents that belonged to a racial or ethnic group was a stronger predictor of the level of commercial hazardous waste activity than was household income, the value of the homes, the number of uncontrolled waste sites, or the estimated amount of hazardous wastes generated by industry".&lt;ref&gt;Colquette and Robertson, 159-160.&lt;/ref&gt; The second study examined the presence of uncontrolled toxic waste sites in ethnic and racial minority communities, and found that 3 out of every 5 African and Hispanic Americans lived in communities with uncontrolled waste sites.&lt;ref&gt;Colquette and Robertson, 159-161.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies like the 1987 "Toxic Waste and Race in the United States" by the Commission for Racial Justice found race to be the most influential variable in predicting where waste facilities were located.&lt;ref name="Godsil"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Godsil|first=Rachel D.|title=Remedying Environmental Racism|journal=[[Michigan Law Review]]|year=1991|volume=90|pages=394â395}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Deserting the Perpetrator - Victim Model of studying environmental justice issues, the Economic/Environmental Justice Model utilized a sharper lens to study the many complex factors, accompanied to race, that contributes to the act of environmental racism and injustice. Using this model the role of history and the overlapping of interest groups, stakeholders, and organizations are considered in case studies of environmental racism. For example, Lerner in ''Diamond: A struggle for Environmental Justice in Louisiana's Chemical Corridor'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diamond: A Struggle for Environmental Justice in Louisiana's Chemical Corridor (Urban and Industrial Environments)|last=Lerner|first=Steve|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-262-62204-2 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; not only revealed the role of race in the division of Diamond and Norco residents, but he also revealed the historical roles of the Shell Oil Company, the slave ancestry of Diamond residents, and of the history of white workers and families that were dependent upon the rewards of Shell. Involvement of outside organizations, such as the Bucket Brigade and Greenpeace, was also considered in the power that the Diamond community had when battling for environmental justice.

In wartimes, environmental racism can occur and are unearthed to the public through reports. Examining the [[IsraeliâPalestinian conflict|Israeli-Palestine conflict]], Friends of the Earth International's Environmental Nakba report brings attention to environmental racism that has occurred in the Gaza Strip. Some Israeli practices include cutting off three days of water supply to refugee Palestinians and destructing farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edblogs.columbia.edu/scppx3335-001-2014-1/2014/04/02/beyond-the-us-borders-the-palestinian-israeli-case/#more-354|title=Beyond the US Borders: The Palestinian â Israeli Case {{!}} Environmental Leadership, Action and Ethics|website=edblogs.columbia.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Besides studies that point out cases of environmental racism, studies have also provided information on how to go about changing regulations and preventing environmental racism from happening. In a study by Daum, Stoler and Grant on e-waste management in Accra, Ghana, the importance of engaging with different fields and organizations such as recycling firms, communities, and scrap metal traders, to name a few are emphasized over adaptation strategies such as bans on burning and buy-back schemes that have not caused much effect on changing practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daum|first=Kurt|last2=Stoler|first2=Justin|last3=Grant|first3=Richard J.|date=2017|title=Toward a More Sustainable Trajectory for E-Waste Policy: A Review of a Decade of E-Waste Research in Accra, Ghana|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5334689/|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=14|issue=2|pages=135|doi=10.3390/ijerph14020135|issn=1661-7827|pmc=5334689|pmid=28146075|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=September 2013|title=Environmental Nakba|url=https://www.foei.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06-foei-palestine-report-eng-lr.pdf|journal=Friends of the Earth International Report|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have also shown that since environmental laws have become prominent in the U.S. as well as Europe so companies have moved their waste towards the global south. The Third World has less of a focus on environmental concerns and therefore are susceptible to more discriminatory practices. This has not stopped activism however it has limited the effects activism has on political restrictions. As these activists push on there are still companies destroying land in these countries with harmful chemicals that are cheaper to use. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/08941920802100721|title = Third World Environmental Justice| journal=Society &amp; Natural Resources| volume=21| issue=7| pages=547â555|year = 2008|last1 = Schroeder|first1 = Richard| last2=Martin| first2=Kevin St.| last3=Wilson| first3=Bradley| last4=Sen| first4=Debarati}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activism ===
Manifestations of environmental racism predate the coining of such terminology. Before the 1970s, communities of color recognized this reality and organized against it. For example, the [[Black Panther Party]] organized survival programs that confronted the inequitable distribution of trash in predominantly black neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt; (1973). The Black Panther. Retrieved from http://www.itsabouttimebpp.com/Survival_Programs/pdf/Survival_Programs.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Young Lords]], a Puerto Rican revolutionary nationalist organization based in Chicago and New York City, protested pollution and toxic refuse present in their community via their Garbage Offensive program. These and other organizations also worked to confront the maldistribution of open spaces, toxic lead paint, and healthy food options.&lt;ref&gt;Enck-Wanzer, D. (2010). ''The Young Lords: A Reader''. New York: New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt; They also offered health programs to those affected by preventable, environmentally induced diseases such as tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;Enck-Wanzer, D. (2010). ''The Young Lords: A Reader''. New York: New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
In this way, these organizations serve as precursors to more pointed movements against environmental racism.

[[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King Jr]]. helped to bring light to the injustices done to many low-income neighborhoods and the working conditions of African-Americans. In the year before his assassination, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] was in the midst of organizing a protest in Washington to create a bill to help the poor and homeless in the United States. After his assassination Â and even with the push of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), this bill would never come to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/martin-luther-king-jr---8-peaceful-protests-that-bolstered-civil-rights.html|title=Martin Luther King Jr.: 8 peaceful protests that bolstered civil rights|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latino ranch laborers composed by Cesar Chavez battled for working environment rights, including insurance from harmful pesticides in the homestead fields of California's San Joaquin Valley. In 1967, African-American understudies rioted in the streets of Houston to battle a city trash dump in their locale which had killed two kids. In 1968, occupants of West Harlem, in New York City, battled unsuccessfully against the siting of a sewage treatment plant in their neighborhood. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nrdc.org/stories/environmental-justice-movement|title=The Environmental Justice Movement|work=NRDC|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One approach in activism is promoting the development and manufacturing of renewable energy sources and the integration of health, economic and preparedness issues into climate policies. However, despite President Bill Clintonâs executive order 12898, there remains differences between policy and action that advocacy groups continue to address.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White-Newsome|first=Jalonne Lynay|date=2016-07-02|title=A Policy Approach Toward Climate Justice|journal=The Black Scholar|language=en|volume=46|issue=3|pages=12â26|doi=10.1080/00064246.2016.1188353|issn=0006-4246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With time environmental justice and civil rights movements fused together and as a result environmental justice organizations stood up for more ethnic groups and this increased diversity within the organization. The fusion is very logical since the people who suffer the most are minority groups. One of the main environmental problems that minority groups suffer from is uncontrolled toxic wastes. The factor that initiated environmental justice is the relationship between the geography of minority groups and hazardous waste landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rdcu.be/bb1lL|title=Cities in the new millennium: Environmental justice, the spatialization of race, and combating anti-urbanism|website=rdcu.be|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When environmental racism became acknowledged in the US society, it stimulated the environmental justice social movement that gained wave throughout the 1970s and 1980s in the US. Historically, the term environmental racism has had ties with the environmental justice movement.Â  However, this has changed with time to the extent it is believed to lack any associations with the movement. Grassroots organizations and campaigns have sprung up in response to this environmental racism with these groups mainly demanding the inclusion of minorities when it comes to policy making involving the environment. It is also worth noting that this concept is international despite being coined in the US. A perfect example is when the United States exported its hazardous wastes to the poor nations in the Global South because they knew that these countries had lax environmental regulations and safety practices. Marginalized communities are usually at risk of environmental racism because they resource and means to oppose the large companies that dump these dangerous wastes.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;Â  As already stated, environmental racism is international, implying that it not only occurs in the United States. 

===Policies and International agreements===
The [[global waste trade|export of hazardous waste]] to third world countries is another growing concern. Between 1989 and 1994, an estimated 2,611 metric tons of hazardous waste was exported from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries to non-OECD countries. Two international agreements were passed in response to the growing exportation of hazardous waste into their borders. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) was concerned that the Basel Convention adopted in March 1989 did not include a total ban on the trans-boundary movement on hazardous waste. In response to their concerns, on January 30, 1991, the Pan-African Conference on Environmental and Sustainable Development adopted the Bamako Convention banning the import of all hazardous waste into Africa and limiting their movement within the continent. In September 1995, the G-77 nations helped amend the Basel Convention to ban the export of all hazardous waste from industrial countries (mainly OECD countries and Lichtenstein) to other countries.&lt;ref name=Bullard&gt;{{cite web|last=Bullard |first=Robert |title=Confronting Environmental Racism in the Twenty-First Century |url=http://www.worlddialogue.org/content.php?id=179 |publisher=Global Dialogue |accessdate=November 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426041754/http://www.worlddialogue.org/content.php?id=179 |archivedate=April 26, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[globalization]] and the increase in transnational agreements, introduce possibilities for cases of environmental racism. For example, the 1994 [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) attracted US-owned factories to Mexico, where toxic waste was abandoned in the Colonia Chilpancingo community and was not cleaned up until activists called for the Mexican government to clean up the waste.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the US, the environmental justice movement uses the Civil Rights Act (CRA) of 1964 to combat environmental racism in legal cases. For example, the CRA was used in the 1994 lawsuit against the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority which failed to provide services for poor LA County residents.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In Canada, progress is being made to address environmental racism (especially in Nova Scotia's [[Africville]] community) with the passing of Bill 111, An Act to Address Environmental Racism in the Nova Scotia Legislature.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

In response to fatal diesel pollution in the air around ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach in 2006, the San Pedro Bay Ports Clean Air Action Plan, or CAAP, was passed.&lt;ref&gt;Juan De Lara (2018) [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24694452.2017.1393328 âThis Port Is Killing Peopleâ]: Sustainability without Justice in the Neo-Keynesian Green City, Annals of the American Association of Geographers, 108:2, 538-548, DOI: 10.1080/24694452.2017.1393328&lt;/ref&gt; The action plan was created to reduce pollution caused by ports; specifically, it demanded a 45% decrease in pollution once the proposal was put into action. &lt;ref&gt;De Lara 2017, p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt; Another layer of the planâs objective was to reduce negative environmental impacts from trucks with the initial plans for the Clean Truck Program (CTP), which intended to cut back on the use of shipping trucks from the docks and instead called for purer options like rail yards and warehouses that could hopefully improve the air quality. &lt;ref&gt;De Lara 2017, p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:This was a timely capture (3926001309).jpg|thumb|Fight or flight?]]
The '''fight-or-flight response''' (also called '''hyperarousal''', or the '''acute stress response''') is a physiological reaction that occurs in response to a perceived [[Psychological trauma|harmful event]], [[Trauma (medicine)|attack]], or threat to survival.&lt;ref name="Cannon - Fight or Flight Response"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cannon|first=Walter|title=Wisdom of the Body|year=1932|publisher=W.W.

==Physiology ==

===Autonomic nervous system===
{{See also|Autonomic nervous system}}
The autonomic nervous system is a control system that acts largely unconsciously and regulates [[heart rate]], [[digestion]], [[respiratory rate]], [[pupillary dilation|pupillary response]], [[Micturition|urination]], and [[sexual arousal]]. This system is the primary mechanism in control of the fight-or-flight response and its role is mediated by two different components: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system.&lt;ref name="Human Physiology - Janig"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Janig|editor-first=W|title=Human Physiology|year=1989|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York, NY|pages=333â370|author=Schmidt, A; Thews, G|edition=2|chapter=Autonomic Nervous System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sympathetic nervous system====
{{See also|Sympathetic nervous system}}
The sympathetic nervous system originates in the [[spinal cord]] and its main function is to activate the physiological changes that occur during the fight-or-flight response. This component of the autonomic nervous system utilises and activates the release of [[norepinephrine]] in the reaction.&lt;ref name="Autonomic Nervous System - Chudler"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chudler|first=Eric|title=Neuroscience For Kids|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/auto.html|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parasympathetic nervous system====
{{See also|Parasympathetic nervous system}}
The parasympathetic nervous system originates in the sacral spinal cord and [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]], physically surrounding the sympathetic origin, and works in concert with the sympathetic nervous system. Its main function is to activate the "rest and digest" response and return the body to [[homeostasis]] after the fight or flight response. This system utilises and activates the release of the neurotransmitter [[acetylcholine]].&lt;ref name="Autonomic Nervous System - Chudler" /&gt;

===Reaction===
[[File:The Fight or Flight Response.png|thumb|upright=1.3|The fight-or-flight response]]
The reaction begins in the [[amygdala]], which triggers a neural response in the [[hypothalamus]]. The initial reaction is followed by activation of the [[pituitary gland]] and secretion of the hormone [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|ACTH]].&lt;ref name="ACTH Action"&gt;{{cite web |last=Margioris |first=Andrew |title=ACTH Action on the Adrenal |url=http://www.endotext.org/adrenal/adrenal5/adrenal5.htm |publisher=Endotext.org |accessdate=18 April 2013 |author2=Tsatsanis, Christos |date=April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306182338/http://www.endotext.org/adrenal/adrenal5/adrenal5.htm |archivedate=6 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[adrenal gland]] is activated almost simultaneously, via the sympathetic nervous system, and releases the hormone [[epinephrine]]. The release of chemical messengers results in the production of the hormone [[cortisol]], which increases [[blood pressure]], [[blood sugar]], and suppresses the [[immune system]].&lt;ref name="physiological reactions - Padgett &amp; Glaser"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Padgett|first=David|author2=Glaser, R|title=How stress influences the immune response|journal=Trends in Immunology|date=August 2003|volume=24|issue=8|pages=444â448|doi=10.1016/S1471-4906(03)00173-X|pmid=12909458|citeseerx=10.1.1.467.1386}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial response and subsequent reactions are triggered in an effort to create a boost of energy. This boost of energy is activated by epinephrine binding to [[cells (biology)|liver cells]] and the subsequent production of [[glucose]].&lt;ref name="Glycogen Metabolism - King"&gt;{{cite web|last=King|first=Michael|title=PATHWAYS: GLYCOGEN &amp; GLUCOSE|url=http://neuromuscular.wustl.edu/pathol/diagrams/glycogen.htm|publisher=Washington University, St. Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the circulation of cortisol functions to turn [[fatty acids]] into available energy, which prepares muscles throughout the body for response.&lt;ref name="Cell Communication in Fight or Flight"&gt;{{cite web |title=HOW CELLS COMMUNICATE DURING THE FIGHT OR FLIGHT RESPONSE |url=http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/begin/cells/fight_flight/ |publisher=University of Utah |accessdate=18 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808004906/http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/begin/cells/fight_flight/ |archivedate=8 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Catecholamine hormones, such as [[Epinephrine|adrenaline]] ([[epinephrine]]) or [[noradrenaline]] (norepinephrine), facilitate immediate physical reactions associated with a preparation for violent [[muscular]] action and:&lt;ref name=gleitman&gt;{{Cite book|author= [[Henry Gleitman]], Alan J.

===Function of physiological changes===
The physiological changes that occur during the fight or flight response are activated in order to give the body increased strength and speed in anticipation of fighting or running. Some of the specific physiological changes and their functions include:&lt;ref name="Physiological Changes - Tripod"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stress Management for Health Course|title=The Fight Flight Response|url=http://stresscourse.tripod.com/id11.html|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Science of Stress - Olpin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Olpin|first=Michael|title=The Science of Stress|url=http://faculty.weber.edu/molpin/healthclasses/1110/bookchapters/stressphysiologychapter.htm|publisher=Weber State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increased [[blood flow]] to the muscles activated by diverting blood flow from other parts of the body.
* Increased blood pressure, heart rate, blood sugars, and fats in order to supply the body with extra energy.
* The [[Coagulation|blood clotting]] function of the body speeds up in order to prevent [[bleeding|excessive blood loss]] in the event of an injury sustained during the response.
* Increased [[Muscle tone|muscle tension]] in order to provide the body with extra speed and strength.

==Emotional components==

===Emotion regulation===
{{See also|Emotional self-regulation}}
In the context of the fight or flight response, emotional regulation is used proactively to avoid threats of stress or to control the level of emotional arousal.&lt;ref name="Emotional Regulation - Cistler"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cistler|first=Josh|author2=Bunmi O. Olatunji |author3=Matthew T. Feldner |author4=John P. Forsyth |title=Emotion Regulation and the Anxiety Disorders: An Integrative Review|journal=Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment|year=2010|volume=32|issue=1|pages=68â82|doi=10.1007/s10862-009-9161-1|pmid=20622981|pmc=2901125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emotional Regulation - Gross"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gross|first=James|title=Sharpening the Focus: Emotion Regulation, Arousal, and Social Competence|journal=Psychological Inquiry|year=1998|volume=9|issue=4|pages=287â290|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0904_8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotional reactivity===
During the reaction, the intensity of emotion that is brought on by the stimulus will also determine the nature and intensity of the behavioral response.&lt;ref name="Emotional Reactivity - Avero"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Avero|first=Pedro|author2=Calvo, M|title=Emotional reactivity to social-evaluative stress: genderdifferences in response systems concordance|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=1 July 1999|volume=27|issue=1|pages=155â170|doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(98)00229-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with higher levels of emotional reactivity may be prone to [[anxiety]] and [[aggression]], which illustrates the implications of appropriate emotional reaction in the fight or flight response.&lt;ref name="Emotional Reactivity - Carthy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carthy|first=T|author2=Horesh N |author3=Apter A |author4=Edge MD |author5=Gross JJ |title=Emotional reactivity and cognitive regulation in anxious children|journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy|date=May 2010|volume=48|issue=5|pages=384â393|doi=10.1016/j.brat.2009.12.013|pmid=20089246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emotional reactivity - Valiente"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valiente|first=C|author2=Eisenberg N |author3=Smith CL |author4=Reiser M |author5=Fabes RA |author6=Losoya S |author7=Guthrie IK |author8=Murphy BC |title=The relations of effortful control and reactive control to children's externalising problems: A longitudinal assessment|journal=Personality|date=December 2003|volume=71|issue=6|pages=1171â1196|doi=10.1111/1467-6494.7106011 |pmid=14633062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive components==

===Content specificity===
The specific components of cognitions in the fight or flight response seem to be largely negative. These negative cognitions may be characterised by: attention to negative stimuli, the perception of ambiguous situations as negative, and the recurrence of recalling negative words.&lt;ref name="Content specificity - Reid"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reid|first1=Sophie C.|last2=Salmon|first2=Karen|author3=Peter F. Lovibond|title=Cognitive Biases in Childhood Anxiety, Depression, and Aggression: Are They Pervasive or Specific?|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|date=October 2006|volume=30|issue=5|pages=531â549|doi=10.1007/s10608-006-9077-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also may be specific negative thoughts associated with emotions commonly seen in the reaction.&lt;ref name="Content Specificity - Beck"&gt;{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Aaron|title=Cognitive Therapy and the Emotional Disorders|year=1979|publisher=Penguin Books|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perception of control===
{{See also|Control (psychology)}}
[[Perceived control]] relates to an individual's thoughts about control over situations and events.&lt;ref name="Perceived Control - Weems"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weems|first=CF|author2=Silverman, WK|title=An integrative model of control: implications for understanding emotion regulation and dysregulation in childhood anxiety|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|date=April 2006|volume=91|issue=2|pages=113â124|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2006.01.009|pmid=16487599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceived control should be differentiated from actual control because an individual's beliefs about their abilities may not reflect their actual abilities. Therefore, overestimation or underestimation of perceived control can lead to anxiety and aggression.&lt;ref name="Perceived Control - Brendgen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brendgen|first=M|author2=Vitaro F |author3=Turgeon L |author4=Poulin F |author5=Wanner B |title=Is there a dark side of positive illusions? Overestimation of social competence and subsequent adjustment in aggressive and nonaggressive children|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|date=June 2004|volume=32|issue=3|pages=305â320|doi=10.1023/B:JACP.0000026144.08470.cd|pmid=15228179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social information processing===
{{See also|Social information processing (cognition)}}
The social information processing model proposes a variety of factors that determine behavior in the context of social situations and preexisting thoughts.&lt;ref name="Social Information Processing - Crick"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crick|first=Nicki|author2=Dodge, Kenneth|title=A review and reformulation of social information-processing mechanisms in children's social adjustment|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=January 1994|volume=115|issue=1|pages=74â101|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.115.1.74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attribution of hostility, especially in ambiguous situations, seems to be one of the most important cognitive factors associated with the fight or flight response because of its implications towards aggression.&lt;ref name="Social Information Processing - Dodge"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodge|first=Kenneth|title=Social cognition and children's aggressive behavior|journal=Journal of Child Development|date=March 1980|volume=51|issue=1|pages=162â170|doi=10.2307/1129603|jstor=1129603}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==

===Evolutionary perspective===
An [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation is that early animals had to react to threatening stimuli quickly and did not have time to psychologically and physically prepare themselves. The fight or flight response provided them with the mechanisms to rapidly respond to threats against survival.&lt;ref name="Purpose of fight or fight - Grohol"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grohol|first=John|title=What's the purpose of the fight or flight response?|url=http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2012/12/04/whats-the-purpose-of-the-fight-or-flight-response/|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Concepts of Stress - Goldstein"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=David|author2=Kopin, I|title=Evolution of concepts of stress|journal=Stress|year=2007|volume=10|issue=2|doi=10.1080/10253890701288935|pages=109â20|pmid=17514579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
A typical example of the stress response is a grazing [[zebra]]. If the zebra sees a [[lion]] closing in for the kill, the stress response is activated as a means to escape its [[Predatory imminence continuum|predator]]. The escape requires intense muscular effort, supported by all of the bodyâs systems. The [[sympathetic nervous system]]âs activation  provides for these needs. A similar example involving fight is of a cat about to be attacked by a dog. The cat shows accelerated heartbeat, [[piloerection]] (hair standing on end), and pupil dilation, all signs of sympathetic arousal.&lt;ref name=gleitman/&gt; Note that the zebra and cat still maintain [[homeostasis]] in all states.

===Varieties of responses===

[[File:Ruseckas-Stumbro medÅ¾ioklÄ.jpg|thumb|Bison hunted by dogs]]
Animals respond to threats in many complex ways. Rats, for instance, try to escape when threatened, but will fight when cornered. Some animals stand perfectly still so that predators will not see them. Many animals freeze or play dead when touched in the hope that the predator will lose interest.

Other animals have alternative self-protection methods. Some species of [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]] animals [[Chromatophore|change color]] swiftly, to camouflage themselves.&lt;ref name="Fish changing colors"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gill|first=A.C.|title=Revision of the Indo-Pacific dottyback fish subfamily Pseudochrominae (Perciformes: Pseudochromidae)|year=2004|publisher=Smithiana Monographs|pages=1â123}}&lt;/ref&gt; These responses are triggered by the sympathetic nervous system, but, in order to fit the model of fight or flight, the idea of flight must be broadened to include escaping capture either in a physical or sensory way. Thus, flight can be disappearing to another location or just disappearing in place. And often both fight and flight are combined in a given situation.

The fight or flight actions also have polarity â the individual can either fight or flee against something that is threatening, such as a hungry lion, or fight for or fly towards something that is needed, such as the safety of the shore from a raging river.

A threat from another animal does not always result in immediate fight or flight. There may be a period of heightened awareness, during which each animal interprets behavioral signals from the other. Signs such as paling, piloerection, immobility, sounds, and body language communicate the status and intentions of each animal. There may be a sort of negotiation, after which fight or flight may ensue, but which might also result in playing, mating, or nothing at all. An example of this is kittens playing: each kitten shows the signs of sympathetic arousal, but they never inflict real damage.

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}

A '''flashback''' (sometimes called an '''analepsis''') is an interjected [[scene (fiction)|scene]] that takes the narrative back in time from the current point in the [[Plot (narrative)|story]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Pavis, Shantz | year= 1998 | title = Dictionary of the Theatre: Terms, Concepts, and Analysis | publisher = University of Toronto Press | page = 151 | isbn= 0802081630}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flashbacks are often used to recount events that happened before the story's primary sequence of events to fill in crucial [[backstory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kenny | year = 2004 | title = Teaching Tv Production in a Digital World: Integrating Media Literacy | publisher = Libraries Unltd Incorporated | page = 163 | isbn= 1591581990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the opposite direction, a [[flashforward]] (or prolepsis) reveals events that will occur in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/flash-forward|title=flash-forward|author=|date=|website=thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both flashback and flashforward are used to cohere a story, develop a character, or add structure to the narrative. In literature, '''internal analepsis''' is a flashback to an earlier point in the narrative; '''external analepsis''' is a flashback to a time before the narrative started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Jung | year = 2010 | title = Narrating Violence in Post-9/11 Action Cinema: Terrorist Narratives, Cinematic Narration, and Referentiality | publisher = VS Verlag fÃ¼r Sozialwissenschaften | page = 67 | isbn= 3531926020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In film, flashbacks depict the subjective experience of a character by showing a memory of a previous event and they are often used to "resolve an enigma".&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Flashback" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 153-160 &lt;/ref&gt; Flashbacks are important in [[film noir]] and [[melodrama]] films. &lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Flashback" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 153-160 &lt;/ref&gt; In movies and television, several camera techniques, editing approaches and special effects have evolved to alert the viewer that the action shown is a flashback or flashforward; for example, the edges of the picture may be deliberately blurred, photography may be jarring or choppy, or unusual coloration or sepia tone, or [[monochrome]] when most of the story is in full color, may be used. The scene may fade or dissolve, often with the camera focused on the face of the character and there is typically a voice-over by a narrator (who is often, but not always, the character who is experiencing the memory).&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Flashback" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 153-160 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==

===Literature===
An early example of analepsis is in the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'', where the main story is narrated through a [[frame story]] set at a later time. Another ancient example occurs in the ''[[Odyssey]]'', in which the tale of Odysseus' wanderings is told in flashback by Odysseus to a listener. Another early use of this device in a [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] was in "[[The Three Apples]]", an ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale. The story begins with the discovery of a young woman's dead body. After the murderer later reveals himself, he narrates his reasons for the murder in a series of flashbacks leading up to the discovery of her dead body at the beginning of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flashbacks are also employed in several other ''Arabian Nights'' tales such as "[[Sinbad the Sailor]]" and "[[The City of Brass]]".

Analepsis was used extensively by author [[Ford Madox Ford]], and by poet, author, historian and mythologist [[Robert Graves]]. The 1927 book ''[[The Bridge of San Luis Rey]]'' by [[Thornton Wilder]] is the progenitor of the modern disaster epic in literature and film-making, where a single disaster intertwines the victims, whose lives are then explored by means of flashbacks of events leading up to the disaster. Analepsis is also used in ''[[Night (novel)|Night]]'' by [[Elie Wiesel]]. If flashbacks are extensive and in chronological order, one can say that these form the present of the story, while the rest of the story consists of flash forwards. If flashbacks are presented in non-chronological order, the time at which the story takes place can be ambiguous: An example of such an occurrence is in ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' where the narrative jumps back and forth in time, so there is no actual present time line. ''[[Os LusÃ­adas]]'' is a story about voyage of [[Vasco da Gama]] to [[India]] and back. The narration starts when they were arriving [[Africa]] but it quickly flashes back to the beginning of the story which is when they were leaving [[Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Os LusÃ­adas]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series employs a magical device called a [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Pensieve|Pensieve]], which changes the nature of flashbacks from a mere narrative device to an event directly experienced by the characters, which are thus able to provide commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PensieveFlashback|title=Pensieve Flashback - TV Tropes|author=|date=|website=tvtropes.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027011816/http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PensieveFlashback|archivedate=27 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
The creator of the flashback technique in cinema was ''[[Histoire d'un crime (film)|Histoire dâun crime]]'' directed by [[Ferdinand Zecca]] in 1901. &lt;ref&gt;Turim, Maureen. ''Flashbacks in Film: Memory &amp; History By Maureen Turim''. p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Flashbacks were first employed during the sound era in [[Rouben Mamoulian]]'s 1931 film ''[[City Streets (1931 film)|City Streets]]'', but were rare until about 1939 when, in [[William Wyler]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'' as in [[Emily BrontÃ«]]'s original novel, the housekeeper Ellen narrates the main story to overnight visitor Mr. Lockwood, who has witnessed Heathcliff's frantic pursuit of what is apparently a ghost. More famously, also in 1939, [[Marcel CarnÃ©]]'s movie ''[[Le Jour Se LÃ¨ve]]'' is told almost entirely through flashback: the story starts with the murder of a man in a hotel. While the murderer, played by [[Jean Gabin]], is surrounded by the police, several flashbacks tell the story of why he killed the man at the beginning of the movie.

One of the most famous examples of a flashback is in the [[Orson Welles]]' film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941). The protagonist, Charles Foster Kane, dies at the beginning, uttering the word ''Rosebud''. The remainder of the film is framed by a reporter's interviewing Kane's friends and associates, in a futile effort to discover what the word meant to Kane. As the interviews proceed, pieces of Kane's life unfold in flashback, but Welles' use of such unconventional flashbacks was thought to have been influenced by [[William K. Howard]]'s ''[[The Power and the Glory (1933 film)|The Power and the Glory]]''. Hitchcock used a flashback in ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1956) to reveal the enigma that led to psychological disturbances for the female lead; as with Welles' film, he delayed the flashback until the end of the movie.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Flashback" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 153-160 &lt;/ref&gt;

Though usually used to clarify plot or backstory, flashbacks can also act as an [[unreliable narrator]]. [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Stage Fright (1950 film)|Stage Fright]]'' from 1950 notoriously featured a flashback that did not tell the truth but dramatized a lie from a witness. The multiple and contradictory staged reconstructions of a crime in [[Errol Morris]]'s 1988 documentary ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|The Thin Blue Line]]'' are presented as flashbacks based on divergent testimony. [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1950 ''[[Rashomon]]'' does this in the most celebrated fictional use of contested multiple testimonies.

Sometimes a flashback is inserted into a film even though there was none in the original source from which the film was adapted. The 1956 film version of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s stage musical ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'' used a flashback device which somewhat takes the impact away from a very dramatic plot development later in the film. This was done because the plot of ''Carousel'' was then considered unusually strong for a film musical. In film version of ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' (1967), according to [[Alan Jay Lerner]], a flashback was added not to soften the blow of a later plot development but because the stage show had been criticized for shifting too abruptly in tone from near-comedy to tragedy.

In [[Billy Wilder]]'s [[film noir]] ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944), a flashback from the main character is used to provide a confession to his fraudulent and criminal activities.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Flashback" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 153-160 &lt;/ref&gt;

A good example of both flashback and [[flashforward]] is the first scene of ''[[La JetÃ©e]]'' (1962). As we learn a few minutes later, what we are seeing in that scene is a flashback to the past, since the present of the film's [[diegesis]] is a time directly following [[World War III]]. However, as we learn at the very end of the film, that scene also doubles as a prolepsis, since the dying man the boy is seeing is, in fact, himself. In other words, he is proleptically seeing his own death. We thus have an analepsis and prolepsis in the very same scene.

Occasionally, a story may contain a flashback within a flashback, with the earliest known example appearing in [[Jacques Feyder]]'s ''[[L'Atlantide (1921 film)|L'Atlantide]]''. ''[[Little Annie Rooney (1925 film)|Little Annie Rooney]]'' (1925) contains a flashback scene in a Chinese laundry, with a flashback within that flashback in the corner of the screen.  In [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'' (1962), the main action of the film is told in flashback, with the scene of Liberty Valance's murder occurring as a flashback within that flashback. Other examples that contains flashbacks within flashbacks are the 1968 [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese film]] ''Lone Wolf Isazo''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lone Stalker A.K.A. Lone Wolf Isazo|publisher=[[Japan Society (New York)|Japan Society]]|url=http://www.japansociety.org/event_detail?eid=134fbb96|accessdate=2011-03-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101061943/http://www.japansociety.org/event_detail?eid=134fbb96|archivedate=1 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2004's ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', where almost the entire film (set in 1870) is told as a flashback from 1919 (in [[black-and-white]]) and contains other flashbacks; for example, Madame Giry rescuing the Phantom from a freak show. An extremely convoluted story may contain flashbacks within flashbacks within flashbacks, as in ''[[Six Degrees of Separation (film)|Six Degrees of Separation]]'', ''[[Passage to Marseille]]'', and ''[[The Locket]]''. This technique is a hallmark of [[Kannada]] movie director [[Upendra (actor)|Upendra]] whose futuristic flick ''[[Super (2010 Indian film)|Super]]'' (2010) is set in 2030 and contains multiple flashbacks ranging from 2010 to 2015 depicting a [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian]] India.

[[Satyajit Ray]] experimented with flashbacks in ''[[Pratidwandi|The Adversary]]'' (Pratidwandi, 1972), pioneering the technique of [[Negative (photography)|photo-negative]] flashbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Light: Satyajit Ray From the Apu Trilogy to the Calcutta Trilogy|author=Nick Pinkerton|date=14 April 2009|publisher=''[[The Village Voice]]''|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-04-15/film/first-light-satyajit-ray-from-the-apu-trilogy-to-the-calcutta-trilogy|accessdate=2009-07-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625154630/http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-04-15/film/first-light-satyajit-ray-from-the-apu-trilogy-to-the-calcutta-trilogy|archivedate=25 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quentin Tarantino]] makes extensive use of the flashback and flashforward in many of his films.  In ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' (1992), for example, scenes of the story present are intercut with various flashbacks to give each character's backstory and motivation additional context.  In ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994), which uses a highly [[nonlinear storytelling|nonlinear]] narrative, traditional flashback is also used in the sequence titled "The Gold Watch".  Other films, such as his two-part ''[[Kill Bill]]'' (Part I 2003, Part II 2004), also feature a narrative that bounces between present time and flashbacks.

===Television===
The television series [[Quantico (TV series)]], ''[[Kung Fu (TV series) | Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Psych]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', ''[[Grounded for Life]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]],'' and ''[[I Didn't Do It (TV series)|I Didn't Do It]]'' use flashbacks in every episode. Flashbacks were also a predominant feature of the television shows ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]''.  Many detective shows routinely use flashback in the last act to reveal the culprit's plot, e.g. ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', ''[[Banacek]],'' ''[[Columbo]].''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20240">'''Fordism''' is the basis of [[modernity|modern]] economic and social systems in industrialized, standardized [[mass production]] and [[mass consumption]]. The concept is named for [[Henry Ford]]. It is used in [[social theory|social]], [[economic theory|economic]], and [[management theory]] about [[economic production|production]], [[working conditions]], [[economic consumption|consumption]], and related phenomena, especially regarding the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.willamette.edu/~fthompso/MgmtCon/Fordism_&amp;_Postfordism.html |title=Fordism &amp; Postfordism |publisher=www.willamette.edu |accessdate=2008-12-26 |last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

Fordism is "the eponymous manufacturing system designed to spew out standardized, low-cost goods and afford its workers decent enough wages to buy them."&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeG05|De Grazia 2005]]. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been described as "a model of economic expansion and technological progress based on mass production: the manufacture of standardized products in huge volumes using special purpose machinery and unskilled labor."&lt;ref name="TollidaySteven"&gt;Tolliday, Steven &amp; Zeitlin, Jonathan. ''The Automobile Industry and its Workers: Between Fordism and Flexibility'', St. Martin's Press (New York: 1987) pp. 1â2.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Fordism was a method used to improve productivity in the automotive industry, the principle could be applied to any kind of manufacturing process. Major success stemmed from three major principles:

# The standardization of the product (nothing is handmade, but everything is made through machines and molds by unskilled workers)
# The employment of [[assembly line]]s, which use special-purpose tools and/or equipment to allow unskilled workers to contribute to the finished product
# Workers are paid higher "living" wages so that they can afford to purchase the products they make&lt;ref name="TollidaySteven" /&gt;

The principles, coupled with a technological revolution during Henry Ford's time, allowed for his revolutionary form of labor to flourish. His assembly line was revolutionary though not original as it had previously been used at slaughterhouses. His most original contribution to the modern world was breaking down complex tasks into simpler ones, with the help of specialised tools.&lt;ref name="Editedby"&gt;Edited by; Burrows, Rober; Gilbert, Nigel; Pollert, Anna. ''Fordism and Flexibility: Divisions and Change'' St. Martin's Press (New York: 1992) pp. 13â17.&lt;/ref&gt; Simpler tasks created interchangeable parts that could be used the same every time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dt13as.html|title=A Science Odyssey: People and Discoveries: Ford installs first moving assembly line|author=|date=|website=www.pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; That allowed for a very adaptable flexibility, creating an assembly line that could change its constituent components to meet the needs of the product being assembled.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt; In reality, the assembly line had already been around before Ford although not in quite the same effectiveness as he would create. His real accomplishment was recognizing the potential by breaking it all down into its components, only to build it back up again in a more effective and productive combination, thereby producing an optimum method for the real world.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt;

The major advantages of such a change was that it cut down on the manpower necessary for the factory to operate, and it deskilled the labour itself, cutting down on costs of production.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt; There are four levels of Fordism, as described by [[Bob Jessop]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Ford Motor Company assembly line.jpg|thumb|Ford cars (Model A shown) became a symbol of effective mass production. Efficiency both decreased the price of the cars and allowed Ford to increase his workers' wages. Hence, common workers could buy their own cars.]]

The [[Ford Motor Company]] was one of several hundred small automobile manufacturers that emerged between 1890 and 1910. After five years of producing automobiles, Ford introduced the [[Ford Model T|Model T]], which was simple and light but sturdy enough to drive on the country's primitive roads.&lt;ref name="FonerEric"&gt;Foner, Eric (2006). Give Me Liberty!: An American History. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, pp. 591â592.&lt;/ref&gt; The mass production of this automobile lowered its unit price, making it affordable for the average consumer. Furthermore, Ford substantially increased his workers' wages&lt;ref&gt;Sward, Keith (1948). The Legend of Henry Ford. New York: Rinehart &amp; Company, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; to combat rampant absenteeism and employee turnover, which approached 400% annually, which had the byproduct of giving them the means to become customers. That led to massive consumption. In fact, the Model T surpassed all expectations because it attained a peak of 60% of the automobile output within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Rae, John B. (1969). Henry Ford. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production system that Ford exemplified involved synchronization, precision, and specialization within a company.&lt;ref&gt;Rae, John B. (1969). Henry Ford. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford and his senior managers did not use the word "Fordism" themselves to describe their motivations or worldview, which they did not consider an "[[wikt:ism#Noun|ism]]". However, many contemporaries framed their worldview as one and applied the name Fordism to it.&lt;ref name="Hounshell_1984_pp263,376"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pages=263, 376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term gained prominence when it was used by [[Antonio Gramsci]] in 1934 in his essay "Americanism and Fordism" in his ''[[Prison Notebooks]]''. Since then, it has been used by a number of writers on [[economics]] and society, mainly but not exclusively in the [[Marxist]] tradition.

According to historian [[Charles S. Maier]], Fordism proper was preceded in Europe by [[Taylorism]], a technique of labor discipline and workplace organization, based upon supposedly-scientific studies of human efficiency and incentive systems. It attracted European intellectuals, especially in Germany and Italy, from the ''[[fin de siÃ¨cle]]'' to [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

After 1918, however, the goal of Taylorist labor efficiency thought in Europe moved to "Fordism," the reorganization of the entire productive process by the moving assembly line, standardization, and the mass market. The grand appeal of Fordism in Europe was that it promised to sweep away all the archaic residues of precapitalist society, by subordinating the economy, society, and even the human personality to the strict criteria of technical rationality.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt; The [[Great Depression]] blurred the utopian vision of American [[technocracy]], but [[World War II]] and its aftermath revived the ideal.

The principles of Taylorism were quickly picked up by [[Vladimir Lenin]] and applied to the industrialization of the [[Soviet Union]].

Later, under the inspiration of Gramsci, Marxists picked up the Fordism concept in the 1930s and developed [[Post-Fordism]] in the 1970s. Antonio and Bonanno (2000) trace the development of Fordism and subsequent economic stages, from globalization to neoliberal globalization, during the 20th century, and emphasized America's role in globalization. "Fordism," for Gramsci, meant routine, intensified labor to promote production. Antonio and Bonanno argue that Fordism peaked in the post-World War II decades of American dominance and mass [[consumerism]] but collapsed from political and cultural attacks on the people in the 1970s.

Advances in technology and the end of the [[Cold War]] ushered in a new "neoliberal" phase of globalization in the 1990s. Antonio and Bonanno further suggest that negative elements of Fordism, such as economic inequality, remained, allowing related cultural and environmental troubles, which inhibited America's pursuit of democracy to surface.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio and Bonanno, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Thomas Hughes has detailed how the [[Soviet Union]], in the 1920s and the 1930s, enthusiastically embraced Fordism and Taylorism by importing American experts in both fields as well as American engineering firms to build parts of its new industrial infrastructure. The concepts of the [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plan]] and the centrally-[[planned economy]] can be traced directly to the influence of Taylorism on Soviet thinking. Hughes quotes [[Joseph Stalin]]:&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;Hughes, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"American efficiency is that indomitable force which neither knows nor recognizes obstacles; which continues on a task once started until it is finished, even if it is a minor task; and without which serious constructive work is inconceivable.... The combination of the Russian revolutionary sweep with American efficiency is the essence of Leninism."&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;{{rp|251}}}}

Hughes describes how, as the Soviet Union developed and grew in power, both the Soviets and the Americans chose to ignore or deny the contribution of American ideas and expertise. The Soviets did so because they wished to portray themselves as creators of their own destiny and not indebted to their rivals. Americans did so because they did not wish to acknowledge, during the Cold War, their part in creating a powerful rival.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;

==Regulation theory==
{{original research|date=November 2012}}

Fordism is a key concept in the theories of the [[Regulation school]], often in contrast to [[post-Fordism]], and the term is also used in [[Western Marxism|Western Marxist]] thought.

[[File:Mall culture jakarta36.jpg|thumb|Mass consumption is the other side of Fordism.]]

In Regulation theory, it is a "regime of accumulation" or a macroeconomic pattern of growth, developed in the US and diffused in various forms to Western Europe after 1945. It consisted of domestic [[mass production]] with a range of institutions and policies supporting mass consumption, including stabilizing [[economic policies]] and [[Keynesian]] demand management that generated national demand and social stability; it also included a class compromise or social contract entailing family-supporting wages, job stability and internal labor markets leading broadly shared prosperity: rising incomes were linked to national productivity from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. At the level of the labor process Fordism is [[Taylorist]] and as a national mode of regulation Fordism is [[Keynesianism]].

The social-scientific concept of "Fordism" was introduced by the French [[regulation school]], sometimes known as [[regulation theory]], which is a Marxist-influenced strand of political economy. According to the regulation school, capitalist production paradigms are born from the crisis of the previous paradigm; a newborn paradigm is also bound to fall into crisis sooner or later. The crisis of Fordism became apparent to Marxists in late 1960s.

Marxist regulation theory talks of Regimes of Capital Accumulation (ROA) and Modes of Regulation (MOR). ROAs are periods of relatively settled economic growth and profit across a nation or global region. Such regimes eventually become exhausted, falling into crisis, and are torn down as capitalism seeks to remake itself and return to a period of profit. Such periods of capital accumulation are "underpinned," or stabilised, by MOR. A plethora of laws, institutions, social mores, customs and hegemonies both national and international work together to create the environment for long-run capitalist profit.

Fordism is a tag used to characterise the post-1945 long boom experienced by western nations. It is typified by a cycle of mass production and mass consumption, the production of standardized (most often) consumer items to be sold in (typically) protected domestic markets, and the use of Keynesian economic policies. While the standard pattern is postwar America, national variations of this standard norm are well known. Regulation theory talks of National Modes of Growth to denote different varieties of Fordism across western economies.

Fordism as an ROA broke down, dependent on national experiences, somewhere between the late 1960s and the mid-1970s. Western economies experienced slow or nil economic growth, rising inflation and growing unemployment, much of this as a result of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 oil shock]].

==Post-Fordism==
[[File:Office Worker with Two Monitors.JPG|thumb|Information technology, white-collar work, and specialization are some of the attributes of post-Fordism.]]

The period after Fordism has been termed [[Post-Fordism|Post-Fordist]] and Neo-Fordist. The former implies that global capitalism has made a clean break from Fordism, including overcoming its inconsistencies, but the latter implies that elements of the Fordist ROA continued to exist. The Regulation School preferred the term After-Fordism (or the French ''AprÃ¨s-Fordisme'') to denote that what comes after Fordism was or is not clear.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, S. Brave new world. ''Marxism Today'', October 1988, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Post-Fordist economies:&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;
* New information technologies are important.
* Products are marketed to [[niche market]]s rather than in mass consumption patterns based on [[social class]].
* [[Service industry|Service industries]] predominate over manufacturing.
* The workforce is feminized.
* Financial markets are globalized.

In an [[op-ed]] published in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' he wrote that after his arrival in Iraq in 2006 he found:&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost2008-12-04/&gt;

{{quote|The Army was still conducting interrogations according to the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay model]]: Interrogators were nominally using the methods outlined in the [[U.S. Army Interrogation Field Manual|U.S. Army Field Manual]], the interrogators' bible, but they were pushing in every way possible to bend the rules -- and often break them.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost2008-12-04/&gt;}}

The author has stated that when [[the Pentagon]] vetted the book they initially made 93 [[redaction]]s.&lt;ref name=MiddleEastOnline/&gt;

{{quote|I sued the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] first to review the book and then to argue the redactions, because they had redacted obvious [[unclassified]] material, things that I had taken straight out of the unclassified field manual and also some items that were directly off the Army's own website. So, eventually they acquiesced on eighty of the ninety-three redactions.}}

Alexander is an outspoken opponent of [[torture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://howtobreakaterrorist.blogspot.com/ Terrorist Breaker Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; He refutes the [[effectiveness of torture]], citing its negative long-term effects such as recruiting for Al-Qaeda. He also argues that torture is contrary to the American principles of freedom, liberty, and justice, and that should they resort to torture, American interrogators become the enemy they serve to defeat. Similar arguments have been made by other former interrogators from the [[U.S. military]], [[FBI]], and the [[CIA]], including Colonel [[Steven Kleinman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Background.view&amp;backgroundid=272 Abuse Has No Place in Interrogation Policy, Nieman Watchdog Group Commentary, July 29th, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with human rights lawyer [[Scott Horton (lawyer)|Scott Horton]] for [[Harper's Magazine]], Alexander said

{{quote|The American public has a right to know that they do not have to choose between torture and terror. There is a better way to conduct interrogations that works more efficiently, keeps Americans safe, and doesn't sacrifice our integrity. Our greatest victory to date in this war, the death of [[Abu Musab Al Zarqawi]] (which saved thousands of lives and helped pave the way to the [[Sunni Awakening]]), was achieved using interrogation methods that had nothing to do with torture. The American people deserve to know that.&lt;ref name=harpers&gt;[http://harpers.org/archive/2008/12/hbc-90004036 Six questions for Matthew Alexander, author of How to Break a Terrorist]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alexander described [[Marc Thiessen]]'s 2010 book ''Courting Disaster'', which defended the use of [[enhanced interrogation techniques]], as 'a literary defense of war criminals'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2246692/pagenum/all/|title=Courting Fear|first=Matthew|last=Alexander|authorlink=|publisher=''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''|date=February 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Symbol of Access''' ('''ISA'''), also known as the ('''International''') '''Wheelchair Symbol''', consists of a [[blue]] [[Square (geometry)|square]] overlaid in [[white]] with a stylized image of a person in a [[wheelchair]]. It is maintained as an [[international standard]], [[ISO 7001]] image of the [[International Commission on Technology and Accessibility]] (ICTA), a committee of [[Rehabilitation International]] (RI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
The ISA was designed by Danish design student Susanne Koefoed in 1968. It was first sketched at a radical design conference mounted by the Scandinavian Students Organization (SDO).&lt;ref&gt;Guffey, Elizabeth, [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17547075.2015.1105527 "The Scandinavian Roots of the International Symbol of Access], Design and Culture, 7:3, pp 357-376&lt;/ref&gt;  The group organized a summer study session at Stockholmâs art and design college, [[Konstfack]], alternating time between workshop sessions and larger lectures. In these lectures, the tone was set by the American designer and educator [[Victor Papanek]]. In the writings that he formulated during this period, too, he imagined persons who were disabled âboth physically challenged and mentallyâas figures in need of renewed attention.&lt;ref&gt;Papanek, Victor, Design for the Real World. New York: Pantheon books, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  Although there is no evidence that Papanek met Koefoed, his influence pervaded the seminar where the original ISA was drafted.  Charged with creating a sign-symbol to mark barrier-free accommodations, Koefoed presented an early version of the symbol at the July 1968 exhibition held at the SDO seminarâs end. Koefoedâs symbol depicts an empty wheelchair. This icon was widely promoted around Sweden the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Guffey, [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17547075.2015.1105527 op cit, p. 371.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Montan, director of Swedenâs new Handicapped Institute, also promoted Koefoedâs design to Rehabilitation International.  Head of RIâs International Commission of Technology and Accessibility (ICTA),  Montan was asked by RI to form a special committee that would find and deliver a symbol to the groupâs 1969 convention in Dublin.&lt;ref name=symbol&gt;[http://www.riglobal.org/symbol-of-access/ Rehabilitation International â Symbol of Access] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614104308/http://www.riglobal.org/symbol-of-access/ |date=2011-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Montanâs group was asked to choose from six symbols. When Koefoedâs symbol was presented, several members complained that it was too austere and illegible. As Montan noted: "a slight inconvenience with the symbol is the equally thick lines, which may give an impression of a monogram of letters. With a 'head' on the symbol this inconvenience would disappear."&lt;ref&gt;International Committee on Technical Aids (1969) Symbol of accessibility (Stockholm, ISRD-
ICTA)&lt;/ref&gt; Taking the original copy of the design, Montan would add a circle to the top of the seat to give the impression of a seated figure.

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Universal design]] aims to obviate such symbols by creating products and facilities that are accessible to nearly all users from the start.  The wheelchair symbol is "International" and therefore not accompanied by Braille in any particular language.

Specific uses of the ISA include:
*Marking a parking space reserved for vehicles used by people with disabilities/blue badge holders
*Marking a vehicle used by a person with a disability, often for permission to use a space
*Marking a public lavatory with facilities designed for wheelchair users 
*Indicating a button to activate an automatic door
*Indicating an accessible transit station or vehicle
*Indicating a transit route that uses accessible vehicles

The ISA is assigned the [[Unicode]] code point U+267F,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Modified ISA==
[[File:Alternative Handicapped Accessible sign.svg|alt=white line figure of a person leaning forward, arm raised to propel a wheelchair, blue background|thumb|Modified ISA]]
Some disability activists are advocating for a modified access symbol. [[Sara Hendren]] and [[Brian Glenney]] co-founded the Accessible Icon project, designing the new icon to display an active, engaged image with focus on the person with disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wheelchair icon revamped by guerrilla art project|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/12/13/disability-icon-revamped-guerilla-art-project/HZDJAIORZvL68dukN9L0TL/story.html|newspaper=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some disability organizations such as [[Enabling Unit]] in India are promoting it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Partners I The Accessible Icon Project |url=http://www.accessibleicon.org/partners.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701073838/http://www.accessibleicon.org/partners.html |archivedate=2013-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while other disability organizations like Second Thoughts Connecticut reject it as [[ableist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Proposal to Change Handicapped Parking Signs Gets Mixed Reaction From Disability Community|url=http://www.ctnewsjunkie.com/archives/entry/proposal_to_change_handicapped_parking_signs_gets_mixed_reaction_from_disab/|work=CT News Junkie|date=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the symbol is officially used in the U.S. states of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Connecticut (state)|Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chokshi|first1=Niraj|title=The handicap symbol gets an update â at least in New York state|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/07/29/the-handicap-symbol-gets-an-update-at-least-in-new-york-state/|accessdate=13 May 2015|work=The Washington Post|date=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/Press_Room/Press_Releases/2016/06-2016/Gov__Malloy_Announces_Modernized_Symbol_and_Language_to_be_Phased_in_on_New_Reserved_Parking_Signs/&lt;/ref&gt; The Modified ISA is in the permanent collection of Museum of Modern Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news&lt;!--|title=Accessible Icon Project--&gt;|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=174887|title=Museum of Modern Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Emma Teitel of the ''Toronto Star'', critics say that the modified image would still socially stigmatize to those who have a disability but do not use a wheelchair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Teitel |first1=Emma |title=Critics of new âdynamicâ disability symbol not just anti-PC cranks: Teitel |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/04/26/critics-of-new-dynamic-disability-symbol-not-just-anti-pc-cranks-teitel.html |accessdate=25 November 2018 |work=Toronto Star |publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd. |date=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, the [[Federal Highway Administration]] rejected the new design for use on [[Traffic sign|road signs]] in the United States, citing the fact that it has not been adopted or endorsed by the [[United States Access Board|U.S. Access Board]], the agency responsible for developing the federal criteria for accessible design. The [[International Organization for Standardization]], which established the regular use of the original symbol under [[ISO 7001]], has also rejected the design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interpretation Letter 2(09)-111(I)|url=http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/2_09_111.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isothermal transformation diagrams''' (also known as time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagrams) are plots of temperature versus time (usually on a [[logarithmic scale]]). They are generated from percentage transformation-vs  time measurements, and are useful for understanding the transformations of an [[alloy steel]] at elevated temperatures.  

An isothermal transformation diagram is only valid for one specific composition of material, and only if the temperature is held constant during the transformation, and strictly with rapid cooling to that temperature.  Though usually used to represent transformation kinetics for steels, they also can be used to describe the kinetics of [[crystallization]] in ceramic or other materials. Time-temperature-precipitation diagrams and time-temperature-embrittlement diagrams have also been used to represent kinetic changes in steels.

'''Isothermal transformation''' (IT) diagram or the C-curve is associated with mechanical properties,microconstituents/microstructures, and heat treatments in carbon steels. Diffusional transformations like [[austenite]] transforming to a [[cementite]] and [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] mixture can be explained using the sigmoidal curve; for example the beginning of pearlitic transformation is represented by the pearlite start (P&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) curve. This transformation is complete at P&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; curve. Nucleation requires an incubation time. The rate of nucleation increases and the rate of microconstituent growth decreases as the temperature decreases from the liquidus temperature reaching a maximum at the bay or nose of the curve. Thereafter, the decrease in diffusion rate  due to low temperature offsets the effect of increased driving force due to greater difference in [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]. As a result of the transformation, the microconstituents, [[Pearlite]] and [[Bainite]], form; Pearlite forms at higher temperatures and bainite at lower.

Austenite is slightly undercooled when quenched below [[Eutectic system|Eutectoid]] temperature. When given more time, stable microconstituents can form: ferrite and cementite. Coarse pearlite is produced when atoms diffuse rapidly after phases that form pearlite nucleate. This transformation is complete at the pearlite finish time (P&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;).

However, greater undercooling by rapid quenching results in formation of martensite or bainite instead of pearlite. This is possible provided the cooling rate is such that the cooling curve intersects the martensite start temperature or the bainite start curve before intersecting the P&lt;sub&gt;s &lt;/sub&gt;curve. The martensite transformation being a diffusionless shear transformation is represented by a straight line to signify the martensite start temperature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30245">{{short description|A movement of activists whose Judaism informs their support left-wing or liberal causes}}
The '''Jewish left''' consists of [[Jews]] who identify with, or support, [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] or [[Liberalism|liberal]] causes, consciously as Jews, either as individuals or through organizations. There is no one organization or movement which constitutes the Jewish left, however. Jews have been major forces in the history of the [[labor movement]], the [[settlement house]] movement, the [[women's rights]] movement, [[anti-racist]] work, and [[anti-fascist]] and [[anti-capitalist]] organizations of many forms in [[Europe]], the [[United States]] and modern-day [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/newleft.html "The New Left."] ''Jewish Virtual Library'' (2008); retrieved 6 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Jews have a rich history of involvement in [[Jewish anarchism|anarchism]], [[socialism]], [[Marxism]], and Western [[liberalism]]. Although the expression "on the left" covers a range of politics, many well-known figures "on the left" have been of Jews who were born into Jewish families and have various degrees of connection to Jewish communities, Jewish culture, Jewish tradition, or the Jewish religion in its many variants.

==History==
Jewish leftism has its philosophic roots in the Jewish Enlightenment, or [[Haskalah]], led by thinkers such as [[Moses Mendelssohn]], as well as the support of many European Jews such as [[Ludwig BÃ¶rne]] for [[republicanism|republican]] ideals in the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a movement for [[Jewish Emancipation]] spread across [[Europe]], strongly associated with the emergence of [[political liberalism]], based on the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles of [[rights]] and [[equality under the law]]. Because liberals represented the political left of the time (see [[left-right politics]]), emancipated Jews, as they entered the political culture of the nations where they lived, became closely associated with liberal parties. Thus, many Jews supported the [[American Revolution]] of 1776, the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, and the [[Revolutions of 1848|European Revolutions of 1848]]; while [[History of the Jews in England|Jews in England]] tended to vote for the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], which had led the parliamentary struggle for [[Emancipation of the Jews in England|Jewish Emancipation]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Alderman]] (1983) ''The Jewish Community in British Politics'', Oxford: Clarendon.&lt;/ref&gt; â an arrangement called by some scholars "the liberal Jewish compromise".&lt;ref&gt;see Sharman Kadish ''Bolsheviks and British Jews'', London: Frank Cass. (1992, e. g., pp. 55-60, 132); Jonathan Hyman [http://www.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/medialibrary/arts/history/workingpapers/wp_50.pdf ''Jews in Britain During the Great War''], Manchester: University of Manchester Working Papers in Economic and Social History No. 51, October (2001, e. g., p. 11). The phrase was coined by [[Steven Bayme]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===The emergence of a Jewish working class===
In the age of [[industrialisation]] in the late nineteenth century, a Jewish [[working class]] emerged in the cities of [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Central Europe]]. Before long, a Jewish [[labour movement]] emerged too. The Jewish Labour Bundâ[[General Jewish Labor Union]] was formed in [[Lithuania]], Poland, and Russia in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Mendes, Philip. [http://jewishcurrents.org/rise-fall-jewish-labor-bund-23131 "The Rise and Fall of the Jewish Labor Bund"], ''Jewish Currents'' (Autumn 2013); accessed 8 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctive Jewish [[socialist]] organizations formed and spread across the Jewish [[Pale of Settlement]] in the [[Russian Empire]]. There were also a significant number of people of Jewish origin who did not explicitly identify as Jews per se, but were active in anarchist, socialist, and social democratic as well as communist organizations, movements, and parties.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As [[Zionism]] grew in strength as a political movement, [[socialist Zionist]] parties were formed, such as [[Ber Borochov]]'s [[Poale Zion]]. There were non-Zionist left-wing forms of [[Jewish nationalism]], such as [[Jewish Territorialist Organization|territorialism]] (which called for a Jewish national homeland, but not necessarily in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]), [[Jewish Autonomism|autonomism]] (which called for non-territorial national rights for Jews in multinational empires), and the [[Folkspartei|folkism]], advocated by [[Simon Dubnow]], (which celebrated the [[cultural Judaism|Jewish culture]] of the [[Yiddish]]-speaking masses).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As Eastern European Jews migrated West from the 1880s, these ideologies took root in growing Jewish communities, such as [[London]]'s [[East End]], [[Paris]]'s [[Pletzl]], [[New York City]]'s [[Lower East Side]], and [[Buenos Aires]]. There was a lively Jewish anarchist scene in London, a central figure of which was, the non-Jewish German thinker and writer [[Rudolf Rocker]]. The important Jewish socialist movement in the United States, with its Yiddish-language daily, ''[[The Forward]]'', and trade unions such as the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] and the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers]]. Important figures in these milieux included [[Rose Schneiderman]], [[Abraham Cahan]], [[Morris Winchevsky]], and [[David Dubinsky]].

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Jews played a major role in the [[Social Democratic]] parties of [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Germany]], [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Russia]], [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Austria-Hungary]], and [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania|Poland]]. Historian [[Enzo Traverso]] has used the term "Judeo-Marxism" to describe the innovative forms of [[Marxism]] associated with these Jewish socialists. These ranged from strongly [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] positions hostile to all forms of [[nationalism]] (as with [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Leon Trotsky]]) to positions more sympathetic to cultural nationalism (as with the [[Austromarxists]] or [[Vladimir Medem]]).

===In Soviets and against fascism===
As with the American revolution of 1776, the French revolution of 1789, and the German revolution of 1848, many Jews worldwide welcomed the [[Russian revolution of 1917]], celebrating the fall of a regime that had presided over antisemitic [[pogroms]], and believing that the new order in what was to become the Soviet Union would bring improvements in the situation of Jews in those lands. Many Jews became involved in [[Communist parties]], constituting large proportions of their membership in many countries, including [[Great Britain]] and the U.S. There were specifically Jewish sections of many Communist parties, such as the [[Yevsektsiya]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. The Communist regime in the USSR pursued what could be characterised as ambivalent policies towards Jews and Jewish culture, at times supporting their development as a national culture (e. g., sponsoring significant Yiddish language scholarship and creating an [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast|autonomous Jewish territory]] in [[Birobidzhan]]), at times pursuing antisemitic purges, such as that in the wake of the so-called [[Doctors' plot]]. (See also [[Komzet]].)

With the advent of [[fascism]] in parts of Europe in the 1920s and 1930s, many Jews responded by becoming actively involved in the left, and particularly the Communist parties, which were at the forefront of the [[anti-fascist]] movement. For example, many Jewish volunteers fought in the [[International Brigades]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (for instance in the American [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade]] and in the Polish-Jewish [[Naftali Botwin Company]]). Jews and leftists fought [[Oswald Mosley]]'s British fascists at the [[Battle of Cable Street]]. This mass movement was influenced by the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]] in the Soviet Union.

In [[World War II]], the Jewish left played a major part in [[Resistance during World War II|resistance to Nazism]]. For example, Bundists and left Zionists were key in [[Å»ydowska Organizacja Bojowa]] and the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

===Radical Jews in Central and Western Europe===
As well as the movements rooted in the Jewish working class, relatively [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] [[middle class]] Jews in Central and Western Europe began to search for sources of radicalism in Jewish tradition. For example, [[Martin Buber]] drew on [[Hasidism]] in articulating his anarchist philosophy, [[Gershom Scholem]] was an anarchist and a [[kabbalah]] scholar, [[Walter Benjamin]] was equally influenced by [[Marxism]] and Jewish [[messianism]], [[Gustav Landauer]] was a religious Jew and a [[libertarian communist]], [[Jacob IsraÃ«l de Haan]] combined socialism with [[Haredi]] Judaism, while [[left-libertarian]] [[Bernard Lazare]] became a passionately Jewish Zionist in 1897, but wrote 2 years later to Herzl - and by extension to the [[Zionist Action Committee]] -, "You are [[bourgeois]] in thoughts, bourgeois in your feelings, bourgeois in your ideas, bourgeois in your conception of society.".&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Piterberg (2008), ''The Returns of Zionism: Myths, Politics, and Scholarship in Israel'', London: Verso, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Weimar Germany]], [[Walther Rathenau]] was a leading figure of the Jewish left.

===Socialist Zionism and the Israeli left===
{{Main|Labor Zionism}}
In the twentieth century, especially after the [[Second Aliyah]], socialist Zionism - first developed in Russia by the Marxist Ber Borochov and the non-Marxists [[Nachman Syrkin]] and [[A. D. Gordon]] - became a powerful force in the [[Yishuv]], the Jewish settlement in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Poale Zion, the [[Histadrut]] labour union and the [[Mapai]] party played a major part in the campaign for an [[Israel|Israeli state]], with socialist politicians like [[David Ben-Gurion]] and [[Golda Meir]] amongst the founders of the nation. At the same time, the [[kibbutz]] movement was an experiment in practical socialism.

In the 1940s, many on the left advocated a [[binational state]] in Israel/Palestine, rather than an exclusively Jewish state. (This position was taken by [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Martin Buber]], for example). Since independence in 1948, there has been a lively Israeli left, both Zionist ([[Labor Party (Israel)|the Labour Party]], [[Meretz-Yachad|Meretz]]) and [[anti-Zionist]] ([[Palestine Communist Party]], [[Maki (historical political party)|Maki]]). The Labour Party and its predecessors have been in power in Israel for significant periods since 1948.

There are two worldwide groupings of left-wing Zionist organizations. The World Labour Zionist Movement, associated with the Labor Zionist tendency, is a loose association, including [[Labor Party (Israel)|Avoda]], [[Habonim Dror]], [[Histadrut]] and [[Na'amat]]. The [[Meretz|World Union of Meretz]], associated with what was historically known as the Socialist Zionist tendency, is a loose association of the Israeli Meretz party, the [[Hashomer Hatzair]] Socialist Zionist youth movement, the [[Kibbutz Movement|Kibbutz Artzi Federation]] and the [[Givat Haviva]] research and study center. Both movements exist as factions within the [[World Zionist Organization]], as well as regional or country-specific Zionist movements; the two roughly correspond to the interwar split between the Poale Zion Right (the tradition that led to Avoda) and the Poale Zion Left (Hashomer Hatzair, Mapam, Meretz).

===Apartheid South Africa===
South Africa's Jewish left-wing was heavily involved in left-wing causes such as the anti-apartheid movement. The most famous member of the anti-apartheid Jewish left-wing was [[Helen Suzman|Helen Suzman, DBE]]. There were also several liberal left-wing Jewish defendants in the [[Rivonia Trial]]: [[Joe Slovo]], [[Denis Goldberg]], [[Lionel Bernstein]], [[Bob Hepple]], [[Arthur Goldreich]], [[Harold Wolpe]], and [[James Kantor]].

==Contemporary Jewish left==
===1960sâ1990s===
As the Jewish working class died out in the years after the [[Second World War]], its institutions and political movements did too. The [[Arbeter Ring]] in England, for example, came to an end in the 1950s and Jewish trade unionism in the US ceased to be a major force at that time. There are, however, still some remnants of the Jewish working class organizations left today, including the [[Workmen's Circle]], [[Jewish Labor Committee]], and ''[[The Forward]]'' (newspaper) in New York, the [[International Jewish Labor Bund]] in Australia, and the [[United Jewish People's Order]] in Canada.

The 1960s-1980s saw a renewal of interest among Western Jews in Jewish [[working class culture]] and the various radical traditions of the Jewish past. This led to the growth of a new sort of radical Jewish organization that was both interested in Yiddish culture, Jewish spirituality, and social justice. In the US, for example, between 1980â1992, [[New Jewish Agenda]] functioned as a national, multi-issue progressive membership organization with the mission of acting as a "Jewish voice on the Left and a Left voice in the Jewish Community". In 1991, Jews for Racial and Economic Justice formed to fight for "equitable distribution of economic and cultural resources and political power" in New York City. And in 1999, leftists broke from the LA chapter of the American Jewish Congress to form the [[Progressive Jewish Alliance]]. In Britain, the [[Jewish Socialists' Group]] and Rabbi [[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]]'s [[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]] have similarly continued this tradition, while more recently groups like [[Jewdas]] have taken an even more eclectic and radical approach to Jewishness. In [[Belgium]], the [[Union des progressistes juifs de Belgique]] is, since 1969, the heir of the Jewish Communist and Bundist SolidaritÃ© movement in the [[Belgian Resistance]], embracing the [[Refusal to serve in the Israeli military|Israeli refuseniks]] cause as well as of the undocumented immigrants in Belgium.

===2000sâpresent===
During the first decade of the 2000s, the [[IsraeliâPalestinian conflict]] became a defining element in the composition of the diasporic Jewish left. A new wave of Jewish organizations formed to support Palestinian causes. Groups such as [[Jewish Voice for Peace]], [[Independent Jewish Voices (Canada)]], [[Independent Jewish Voices|Independent Jewish Voices (UK)]] and the [[International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network]] gave renewed voice to [[Jewish Anti-Zionism]]. This perspective continues to be reflected in media outlets such as [[Mondoweiss]] and the Treyf Podcast.

Following the [[2014 IsraelâGaza conflict]], many leftist Jewish organizations in the US and Canada focused on directly challenging establishment Jewish organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/direct-action-disrupts-israeli-canadian-complicity-in-settler-colonialism|title=Direct action disrupts Jewish-Canadian complicity in settler colonialism â Canadian Dimension|website=Canadiandimension.com|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondoweiss.net/2014/09/collapse-israel-consensus|title=The rise of 'If Not Now' and the collapse of the pro-Israel consensus|website=Mondoweiss.net|date=2014-09-10|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/national/339090/17-jewish-activists-protesting-israeli-occupation-arrested-at-adl-headquart/ |title=17 Jewish Activists Protesting Israeli Occupation Arrested at ADL Headquarters|website=Forward.com|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondoweiss.net/2015/07/louis-cancel-police|title=St. Louis Jews call on ADL to cancel honor to police|website=Mondoweiss.net|date=2015-07-18|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Jewish Federations|Jewish Federation]], [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]], the [[Anti-Defamation League]], and [[Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs]], for their support for Israel's actions during the conflict. In the US, this intra-community conflict expanded to domestic politics following the [[United States presidential election, 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jewschool.com/2016/11/78055/photos-young-jews-march-on-trump-hq-stopbannon|title=PHOTOS: Young Jews march on Trump HQ: #StopBannon: Will the Jewish Federations of North America follow suit?|website=Jewschool.com|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups such as If Not Now, [[Jewish Voice for Peace]], and Jews for Racial and Economic Justice began organizing under the banner of #JewishResistance to "challenge institutional Jewish support for the Trump administration and affiliated white nationalists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mic.com/articles/160010/hundreds-join-jewish-resistance-protest-against-trump-chief-strategist-steve-bannon#.mNWlaFWoe|title=Hundreds join #JewishResistance protest against Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon|website=Mic.com|date=2016-11-21|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to exit polls, 71% of American Jews voted Democrat during the 2016 US Presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strickland |first1=Produced By Jon Huang, Samuel Jacoby, Michael |last2=Lai |first2=K. k Rebecca |title=Election 2016: Exit Polls |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html?_r=1 |website=The New York Times |accessdate=16 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20161211011026/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html?_r=1 |archivedate=11 December 2016 |date=8 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last decade, the Jewish vote has gone to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] by 76â80%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/jewvote.html|title=Jewish Voting Record in U.S. Presidential Elections|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in each election.

===Contemporary Israeli left===
Operating in a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] governmental system based on [[proportional representation]], left-wing political parties and blocs in Israel have been able to elect members of the [[Knesset]] with varying degrees of success. Over time, those parties have evolved, with some merging, others disappearing, and new parties arising.

Israeli left-wing parties have included:
*[[Hadash]]
*[[Mapam]]
*[[Meretz-Yachad]]
*[[HaAvoda]]
*[[Meimad]]
*[[Progressive List for Peace]]
*[[Ratz (political party)|Ratz]]
*[[Left Camp of Israel]]
*[[HaOlam HaZeh â Koah Hadash]]

Notable figures in these parties have included: [[Meir Vilner]], [[Shulamit Aloni]], [[Uri Avnery]], [[Yossi Beilin]], [[Ran Cohen]], [[Mattityahu Peled|Matti Peled]], [[Amnon Rubinstein]], and [[Yossi Sarid]].

{{further|Politics of Israel#Political left}}

==British Jewish left==
[[British Jews]] have been influential in the left-wing [[politics of the United Kingdom]] for many years, especially in the main social democratic/socialist party, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], but also in the socially liberal [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].

During the years when the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] was Britain's main party of the left, two Jews in particular attained high office: [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]], who led the Liberal Party from 1930â1935, and [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Rufus Isaacs]], the only British Jew to have been created a Marquess. Other notable Liberal Jews of the 1800s and early 1900s included: [[Lionel de Rothschild]], the first Jew to serve as an MP, [[David Salomons|Sir David Salomons]], [[Francis Goldsmid|Sir Francis Goldsmid]], [[George Jessel (jurist)|Sir George Jessel]], [[Arthur Cohen (politician)|Arthur Cohen]], [[Samuel Montagu, 1st Baron Swaythling|The Lord Swaythling]], [[Sir Edward Sassoon, 2nd Baronet, of Kensington Gore|Sir Edward Sassoon]], [[Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha|The Lord Hore-Belisha]] [[Edwin Samuel Montagu]], [[Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln]], and [[Sydney Stern, 1st Baron Wandsworth|The Lord Wandsworth]].

In the early part of the 20th century, the Liberal Party gave way to the more radical and socialist Labour Party. [[Leonard Woolf]] and [[Hugh Franklin (suffragist)|Hugh Franklin]] were among the figures influential in the early Labour Party, and Jewish MPs like [[Barnett Janner, Baron Janner|Barnett Janner]], [[Sir Percy Harris, 1st Baronet|Sir Percy Harris]] and [[Harry Nathan, 1st Baron Nathan|The Lord Nathan]] were among the radical Liberal MPs, many of whom switched from Liberal to Labour, economists like [[Harold Laski]] and [[Nicholas Kaldor]] and intellectuals like [[Victor Gollancz]] and [[Karl Mannheim]] provided the intellectual impetus for British socialism to take hold. Prominent early Labour MPs included [[Lewis Silkin, 1st Baron Silkin|The Lord Silkin]], who became a Minister in [[Clement Attlee]]'s government, [[Sydney Silverman]], who abolished [[capital punishment]] in Britain, and [[Manny Shinwell, Baron Shinwell|The Lord Shinwell]], one of the leaders of [[Red Clydeside]] who later became [[Secretary of State for War]].

At the end of the [[Second World War]], the Labour Party entered government again, and several newly elected Labour MPs were Jewish, and often on the socialist left of the Party, radicalised by incidents like the [[Battle of Cable Street]]. Those MPs included [[Herschel Lewis Austin]], [[Maurice Edelman]], and [[Ian Mikardo]], as well as [[Phil Piratin]], one of only four MPs in British history to have represented the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]. Several MPs elected in the 1940s and 1950s went on to be Ministers in [[Harold Wilson]]'s governments of the 1960s and 1970s: [[Joel Barnett, Baron Barnett|The Lord Barnett]], [[Edmund Dell]], [[John Diamond, Baron Diamond|John Diamond]], [[Reg Freeson]], [[Dora Gaitskell, Baroness Gaitskell|The Baroness Gaitskell]], [[Myer Galpern]], [[Gerald Kaufman]], [[Harold Lever, Baron Lever of Manchester|The Lord Lever of Manchester]], [[Paul Rose (UK politician)|Paul Rose]], [[Samuel Segal, Baron Segal|The Lord Segal]], [[Beatrice Serota, Baroness Serota|The Baroness Serota]], [[Robert Sheldon, Baron Sheldon|The Lord Sheldon]], [[John Silkin|John]] and [[Samuel Silkin, Baron Silkin of Dulwich|Samuel Silkin]], [[Barnett Stross]], and [[David Weitzman]]. A prominent Jewish Labour politician in this era was [[Leo Abse]], who put forward the private members' bill which decriminalised homosexuality and reformed the divorce laws in Britain. [[Robert Maxwell]], a Labour MP during the 1964â66 Wilson government, eventually became a leading newspaper publisher when his holding company purchased [[Mirror Group Newspapers]] in 1984.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the Labour Party experienced significant turbulence with the rise of the [[Entryism|entryist]] [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant tendency]] (a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] group led by [[Ted Grant]]), and the centre-left [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) breaking away and forming an [[SDPâLiberal Alliance|Alliance]] with the Liberal Party (who had two Jewish MPs, [[Alex Carlile, Baron Carlile of Berriew|The Lord Carlile of Berriew]] and [[Clement Freud]]), later to unite as the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. One such parliamentary defector to the SDP was [[Neville Sandelson]], and the [[Keynesian]] economist [[Robert Skidelsky, Baron Skidelsky|The Lord Skidelsky]] also defected. Those Jewish Labour MPs who stuck with the party included [[Harry Cohen]], [[Alf Dubs, Baron Dubs|Alf Dubs]], [[Millie Miller]], [[Eric Moonman]], and [[David Winnick]].

During the late 1980s and 1990s, with the shift away from the socialist left of the party, and during [[Tony Blair]]'s leadership of the Labour Party, notable senior Jewish politicians included [[Peter Mandelson]], one of the architects of "[[New Labour]]", [[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith]], [[Jeremy Beecham, Baron Beecham|The Lord Beecham]], and [[Philip Gould, Baron Gould of Brookwood|The Lord Gould of Brookwood]]. Mandelson, party fund-raiser [[Michael Levy, Baron Levy|The Lord Levy]] and [[Jack Straw]] (who is of partial Jewish ancestry), were accused by [[Tam Dalyell]], MP, of being a "[[cabal]] of Jewish advisers" around Blair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2999219.stm|title=Dalyell's 'Jewish cabal' remarks denied|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of Blair's Ministers and Labour backbenchers were Jewish or partially Jewish, including [[Barbara Roche]], [[Margaret Hodge|Dame Margaret Hodge]], [[Fabian Hamilton]], [[Louise Ellman]], [[Helene Hayman, Baroness Hayman|The Baroness Hayman]], [[Oona King, Baroness King of Bow|The Baroness King of Bow]], and [[Gillian Merron]]. Labour donors during the 1990s and 2000s who were Jewish included [[David Abrahams (businessman)|David Abrahams]], [[Alexander Bernstein, Baron Bernstein of Craigweil|The Lord Bernstein of Craigweil]], [[Richard Caring]], [[Trevor Chinn|Sir Trevor Chinn]], [[David Garrard (property developer)|Sir David Garrard]], [[Robert Gavron, Baron Gavron|The Lord Gavron]], [[Emmanuel Kaye|Sir Emmanuel Kaye]], [[Andrew Rosenfeld]], [[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville|The Lord Sainsbury of Turville]], and [[Barry Townsley]]. Several of these were caught up in the [[Cash for Honours]] scandal.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Under the government of Blair's successor, [[Gordon Brown]], brothers [[David Miliband]] and [[Ed Miliband]] became members of the Cabinet. Their father was the Marxist academic [[Ralph Miliband]]. The brothers differed in their view of the party's future direction, and they fought a bitter [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2010|leadership election]] against each other in 2010. Ed Miliband won the election and became the first Jewish leader of the Labour Party. One of Miliband's Shadow Cabinet members, [[Ivan Lewis]], as well as advisers [[David Axelrod (political consultant)|David Axelrod]], [[Industrial Areas Foundation|Arnie Graf]], and [[Maurice Glasman, Baron Glasman|The Lord Glasman]] are all Jewish.

Current Jewish Labour politicians include: [[William Bach, Baron Bach|William Bach]], [[Steve Bassam, Baron Bassam of Brighton|The Lord Bassam of Brighton]], [[Luciana Berger]], [[Michael Cashman]], [[Anthony Grabiner, Baron Grabiner|The Lord Grabiner]], [[Ruth Henig, Baroness Henig|Ruth Henig]], [[Jonathan Kestenbaum, Baron Kestenbaum|The Lord Kestenbaum]], [[Jonathan Mendelsohn]], [[Janet Neel Cohen, Baroness Cohen of Pimlico|Janet Neel Cohen]], [[Meta Ramsay, Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale|Meta Ramsay]], [[Catherine Stihler]], [[Andrew Stone, Baron Stone of Blackheath|Andrew Stone]], [[Alan Sugar]], [[Leslie Turnberg, Baron Turnberg|Leslie Turnberg]], and [[Robert Winston]].

Since the foundation of the Liberal Democrats, several Jews have achieved prominence: [[David Alliance, Baron Alliance|David Alliance]], the aforementioned Alex Carlisle, [[Miranda Green (journalist)|Miranda Green]], [[Rosalind Grender, Baroness Grender|Olly Grender]], [[Sally Hamwee, Baroness Hamwee|Sally Hamwee]], [[Evan Harris]], [[Susan Kramer, Baroness Kramer|Susan Kramer]], [[Anthony Lester, Baron Lester of Herne Hill|Anthony Lester]], [[Jonathan Marks, Baron Marks of Henley-on-Thames|Jonathan Marks]], [[Julia Neuberger, Baroness Neuberger|Julia Neuberger]], [[Monroe Palmer, Baron Palmer of Childs Hill|Monroe Palmer]], [[Paul Strasburger, Baron Strasburger|Paul Strasburger]], and [[Lynne Featherstone]], who became a Minister in the [[CameronâClegg coalition|Coalition government 2010-15]].

'''Joseph Raya''' (August 15, 1916 â June 10, 2005), born in [[ZahlÃ©, Lebanon]], was a prominent [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Greek Catholic]] [[archbishop]], theologian, civil rights advocate and author. He served as metropolitan of [[Akko]], [[Haifa]], [[Nazareth]] and All [[Galilee]] from 1968 until 1974 and was particularly known for his commitment to seeking reconciliation between Christians, Jews and Muslims. He was also a leading advocate of celebrating the [[Divine Liturgy]] in [[vernacular]] languages.

==Life==

===Early life===
Joseph-Marie Raya was born to Almez and Mikhail Raya of Zahle and was the seventh of eight children.&lt;ref name="Sabada 2006, p. 55"&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing his elementary education at the Oriental College he studied in Paris before entering St. Anne's seminary in [[Jerusalem]] in 1937.&lt;ref name="Sabada 2006, p. 55"/&gt; He was ordained a priest of the Melkite Catholic Church on July 20, 1941. He later taught at the Patriarchal College on Queen Nazli Street in [[Cairo]]. Raya was expelled from Egypt in 1948 by [[King Farouk]] for defending the rights of women.&lt;ref&gt;Sabana (2006), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; He emigrated to the United States in 1949.

===Birmingham and the civil rights movement===
After serving as assistant pastor of St. Ann's Melkite Catholic Church in [[Woodland Park, New Jersey]], he was appointed pastor of St. George Melkite Greek Catholic Church in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], in 1952. His championing civil rights brought him into close friendship with Rev. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] Raya marched several times at King's side and suffered three times at the hands of the [[Ku Klux Klan]],&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; including one occasion when he was kidnapped and severely beaten by three Klansmen.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;  Defying the threat of excommunication issued by Roman Catholic Archbishop [[Thomas Joseph Toolen|Thomas Toolen]], Raya helped King and other civil rights demonstrators organize protests and marches throughout Alabama during the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), pp. 67-70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Archbishop Toolen Criticizes Presence of Priests, Sisters in Demonstrations". ''Catholic Week'', March 19, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Raya went on to found [[Saint Moses the Black]] Mission, the first Eastern Catholic mission for African Americans, located in downtown Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also very close to social justice activist [[Catherine Doherty]], and he became the first Associate Priest of her [[Madonna House Apostolate]] in [[Combermere, Ontario]], Canada, on July 1, 1959. When he became Archbishop of Nazareth he ordained her husband [[Eddie Doherty]] to the priesthood.

===Advocate of the vernacular for liturgical services===
As a priest in Alabama, Raya advocated for younger generations to have church services in their own languages, and translated the Gospels, Missal, and Byzantine Divine Liturgy into English. Raya created a controversy when he invited Bishop [[Fulton J. Sheen]], the famous television Catholic personality,  to celebrate the Pontifical Byzantine Divine Liturgy in English in 1958 at the Melkite National Convention. Bishop Sheen celebrated the Liturgy in English on television, inspiring some Catholics to renew calls for widespread use of the vernacular but raising the ire of traditionalists.

The Roman Catholic archbishop of Mobile, Alabama, [[Thomas Joseph Toolen|Thomas Toolen]], banned Raya from celebrating the Divine Liturgy in English in December 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), pp. 61-62&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Pope John XXIII]] intervened in March 1960 at the request of Melkite Patriarch [[Maximos IV Sayegh]] to decide the question in favor of the Byzantine custom of celebrating the Divine Mysteries in the vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 Raya's liturgical translation was declared the official English translation for the Catholic Byzantine rites.

Patriarch Maximos IV recognized Raya's successes by elevating him to the dignity of [[Archimandrite|Grand Archimandrite]] of [[Jerusalem]] and appointing him a member of the Melkite patriarchal delegation to the [[Second Vatican Council]]. In a significant break with tradition, the church fathers of Vatican II decided to allow widespread use of vernacular in the Catholic Church. After completing his work at Vatican II Raya continued to translate Melkite works into English. In 1968, with Baron Jose de Vinck of Alleluia Press in New Jersey, he authored ''Byzantine Daily Worship'', a compendium in English of the Divine Liturgy, Office of the Hours, and the sacraments.

===Episcopate===
Following his appointment as archbishop of [[Acre, Israel|Akko]], [[Haifa]], [[Nazareth]] and All [[Galilee]] on October 20, 1968, Archbishop Joseph led a peaceful demonstration of thousands of Arabs and Jews in Israel seeking justice for the villages of [[Kafr Bir'im]] and [[Iqrit]] in Upper Galilee that had been depopulated in 1948, and then destroyed. Iqrit was the hometown of his second successor, Archbishop [[Elias Chacour]]. He sought justice through non-violent means and called upon Palestinians to be good citizens of Israel.

Describing Raya's actions, Father John Catoir wrote in 1969:

{{quote|They (Christian Arabs) are in no mood for brotherhood talks, but (Raya) commands them to stop hating the Jews, to purge their hearts of hatred and contention which breeds only misery and further suffering.

At the closing session of the Israeli parliament he thundered to the Jewish representatives, alternating between French, Arabic, and English for all to understand, that they have done to the Arabs some of the very same things they themselves lament so bitterly in their own history of persecution.

It is quite a thing to see a living prophet in action, challenging the inflamed passions of ancient enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), pp. 84-85 (excerpted from Catoir, John ''A Prophet in Action'', 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In August, 1972 he ordered all churches in his eparchy closed one Sunday to mourn for "the death of justice in Israel" as the two villages remained dispossessed. Explaining his position, Raya said:

{{quote|No end justifies injustice -- even if that end seems to be the good of the state or of a nation. If you base security on denial of justice, no amount of money can guarantee that security. Not even an army as strong as all of the legions of Rome will be able to insure it.&lt;ref&gt;Nester, Marie Yaroshak. ''We Are God's People,'' p. 87. God With Us Publications, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As archbishop, Raya was a controversial figure. While many admired his charismatic style and ecumenical leadership, some Arabs and members of the church hierarchy resented his overtures to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;"Archbishop Resigns". ''The Jerusalem Post'', 30 September 1974, as referenced in Sabada, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Raya was opposed to the Melkite Holy Synod's proposal to internationalize Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; He also upset the Vatican with his aggressive campaign for the return of the Bir'im and Ikrit refugees and the sale of church land to impoverished Moslem farmers.&lt;ref&gt;"Archbishop Raya on reported rift with Vatican 'No one can make me resign'". ''The Jerusalem Post'', March 1973, as referenced in Sabada (2006), p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Raya's letter of resignation declared that the Church hierarchy forced his decision to leave his post.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), pp. 163-164&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Israel considered him dangerous, but when he resigned Prime Minister Golda Meir begged him to reconsider.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Raya's resignation came as a shock to many. The local Christian Youth Club collected several thousand signatures asking him to reconsider,&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; and prominent Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders in Israel and abroad voiced disappointment. Yoram Kaniuk described their thoughts on the archbishop, describing Raya as "incomprehensible. The great majority of people viewed him with suspicion. Because he failed to conform to generally accepted notions ... Unusual people, deeply religious men, men of morals we won't understand. Bishop Raya was out of step. He bore Israel no animosity. He cared for and looked after his spiritual flock."&lt;ref&gt;"Two Bishops in Israel - One was a Friend!" ''Heritage Newspaper'', Southwest Jewish Press, Nov. 8, 1974, as referenced in Sabada (2006), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Departing his post, Raya used his final pastoral letter to underscore his ecumenical approach:

{{quote|I came to the Holy Land to give. And behold! I was overwhelmed by what I received! I came to enrich and purify! And behold! I was the one to be enriched and purified. I loved the family of the Lord. His family are both the Jews and the Arabs. I held the Muslims, the Druze, the Jew, the Christian, everyone believer and unbeliever, in the same embrace.&lt;ref&gt;Raya, Joseph. Pastoral Letter, September 1974, as referenced in Sabada (2006), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After resigning his archbishopric on July 13, 1974, Raya moved to [[Madonna House Apostolate|Madonna House]] in Combermere, Ontario, Canada. At some time between his resignation and 1975 he suffered a massive [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and had a [[quadruple bypass]] operation in Lexington, Kentucky. From his home in Combermere he lectured and wrote on Byzantine spirituality at various places,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.monitor.upeace.org/innerpg.cfm?id_article=1071|title=Peace and Conflict Monitor, Archbishop Joseph Raya â Apostle of Peace and Love|website=www.monitor.upeace.org|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; among them [[Fordham University]]'s John XXIII Ecumenical Center in [[The Bronx]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFLpXKsNeVYC&amp;pg=PR3&amp;lpg=PR3&amp;dq=John+XXIII+Ecumenical+Center,+bronx&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qf5TrvLAaC&amp;sig=-9J5k2Pfyi-GrYy3Mb2HEb6DZa0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjSpKaaktjcAhVLEawKHd2dBDoQ6AEwAXoECA8QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20XXIII%20Ecumenical%20Center,%20bronx&amp;f=false|title=Pseudo-Dionysius: The Complete Works|last=Dionysius|date=1987|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=9780809128389|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Patriarchal Major Seminary at Raboue in Antelias, Lebanon.

In [[particle physics]], a '''lepton''' is an [[elementary particle]] of [[half-integer spin]] ([[spin (physics)|spin]] {{Frac|1|2}}) that does not undergo [[strong interaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two main classes of leptons exist: [[electric charge|charged]] leptons (also known as the [[electron]]-like leptons), and neutral leptons (better known as [[neutrino]]s). Charged leptons can combine with other particles to form various [[composite particle]]s such as [[atom]]s and [[positronium]], while neutrinos rarely interact with anything, and are consequently rarely observed.  The best known of all leptons is the [[electron]].

There are six types of leptons, known as ''[[flavour (particle physics)|flavours]]'', grouped in three ''[[Generation (particle physics)|generations]]''.&lt;ref name="HyperphysicsLepton"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[standard model|first-generation]] Leptons, also called ''electronic leptons'', comprise the [[electron]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Electron-}}) and the [[electron neutrino]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}); the second are the ''muonic leptons'', comprising the [[muon]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}}) and the [[muon neutrino]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}); and the third are the ''tauonic leptons'', comprising the [[Tau (particle)|tau]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Tau-}}) and the [[tau neutrino]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Tau neutrino}}). Electrons have the least mass of all the charged leptons. The heavier muons and taus will rapidly change into electrons and neutrinos through a process of [[particle decay]]: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. Thus electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the [[universe]], whereas muons and taus can only be produced in [[high energy physics|high energy]] collisions (such as those involving [[cosmic ray]]s and those carried out in [[particle accelerator]]s).

Leptons have various [[intrinsic properties]], including [[electric charge]], [[spin (physics)|spin]], and [[mass]]. Unlike [[quark]]s however, leptons are not subject to the [[strong interaction]], but they are subject to the other three [[fundamental interaction]]s: [[gravitation]], the [[weak interaction]], and to [[electromagnetism]], of which the latter is proportional to charge, and is thus zero for the electrically neutral neutrinos.

For every lepton flavor there is a corresponding type of [[antiparticle]], known as an [[antilepton]], that differs from the lepton only in that some of its properties have [[additive inverse|equal magnitude but opposite sign]]. According to certain theories, neutrinos may be [[Majorana fermion|their own antiparticle]]. It is not currently known whether this is the case.

The first charged lepton, the electron, was theorized in the mid-19th century by several scientists&lt;ref name="farrar"&gt;

Leptons are an important part of the [[Standard Model]]. Electrons are one of the components of [[atom]]s, alongside [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s. [[Exotic atom]]s with muons and taus instead of electrons can also be synthesized, as well as leptonâantilepton particles such as [[positronium]].

==Etymology==
The name ''lepton'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|el|Î»ÎµÏÏÏÏ}} ''leptÃ³s'', "fine, small, thin" ([[Grammatical gender|neuter]] nominative/accusative singular form: Î»ÎµÏÏÏÎ½ ''leptÃ³n'');&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lepton "lepton"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|lepto/s|Î»ÎµÏÏÏÏ|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest attested form of the word is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] {{lang|gmy|ð©ð¡ðµ}}, ''re-po-to'', written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;Found on the [[Knossos|KN]] L 693 and [[Pylos|PY]] Un 1322 tablets. {{cite web|title=The Linear B word re-po-to|publisher=Palaeolexicon. Word study tool of ancient languages|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ShowWord.aspx?Id=16917}} {{cite web|url= http://minoan.deaditerranean.com/resources/linear-b-sign-groups/re/re-po-to/|title=re-po-to|work=Minoan Linear A &amp; Mycenaean Linear B|last=Raymoure|first=K.A.|publisher=Deaditerranean}} {{cite web|title=KN 693 L (103)|url=https://www2.hf.uio.no/damos/Index/item/chosen_item_id/630}} {{cite web|title=PY 1322 Un + fr. (Cii)|website=DÄMOS: Database of Mycenaean at Oslo|url=https://www2.hf.uio.no/damos/Index/item/chosen_item_id/5021|publisher=[[University of Oslo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lepton'' was first used by physicist [[LÃ©on Rosenfeld]] in 1948:&lt;ref&gt;L. Rosenfeld (1948)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Following a suggestion of Prof. [[C. MÃ¸ller]], I adoptâas a pendant to "nucleon"âthe denomination "lepton" (from Î»ÎµÏÏÏÏ, small, thin, delicate) to denote a particle of small mass.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The etymology incorrectly implies that all the leptons are of small mass. When Rosenfeld named them, the only known leptons were electrons and muons, whose masses are indeed small compared to nucleonsâthe mass of an electron ({{val|0.511|ul=MeV/c2}})&lt;ref name="Electron"&gt;C. Amsler et al. (2008): [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2008/listings/s003.pdf Particle listingsâ{{SubatomicParticle|Electron-}}]&lt;/ref&gt; and the mass of a muon (with a value of {{val|105.7|u=MeV/c2}})&lt;ref name="Muon"&gt;C. Amsler et al. (2008): [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2008/listings/s004.pdf Particle listingsâ{{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}}]&lt;/ref&gt; are fractions of the mass of the "heavy" proton ({{val|938.3|u=MeV/c2}}).&lt;ref name="Proton"&gt;C. Amsler et al. (2008): [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2008/listings/s016.pdf Particle listingsâ{{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}}]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the mass of the tau (discovered in the mid 1970s) ({{val|1777|u=MeV/c2}})&lt;ref name="Tauon"&gt;C. Amsler et al. (2008): [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2008/listings/s035.pdf Particle listingsâ{{SubatomicParticle|Tau-}}]&lt;/ref&gt; is nearly twice that of the proton, and about 3,500 times that of the electron.

The first lepton identified was the electron, discovered by [[J.J. Thomson]] and his team of British physicists in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;S. Weinberg (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Wilson (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1930 [[Wolfgang Pauli]] postulated the [[electron neutrino]] to preserve [[conservation of energy]], [[conservation of momentum]], and [[conservation of angular momentum]] in [[beta decay]].&lt;ref&gt;K. Riesselmann (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Pauli theorized that an undetected particle was carrying away the difference between the [[energy]], [[momentum]], and [[angular momentum]] of the initial and observed final particles. The electron neutrino was simply called the neutrino, as it was not yet known that neutrinos came in different flavours (or different "generations").

Nearly 40 years after the discovery of the electron, the [[muon]] was discovered by [[Carl D. Anderson]] in 1936.  Due to its mass, it was initially categorized as a [[meson]] rather than a lepton.&lt;ref&gt;S.H. Neddermeyer, C.D. Anderson (1937)&lt;/ref&gt;  It later became clear that the muon was much more similar to the electron than to mesons, as muons do not undergo the [[strong interaction]], and thus the muon was reclassified: electrons, muons, and the (electron) neutrino were grouped into a new group of particlesâthe leptons. In 1962, [[Leon M. Lederman]], [[Melvin Schwartz]], and [[Jack Steinberger]] showed that more than one type of neutrino exists by first detecting interactions of the [[muon]] neutrino, which earned them the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|1988 Nobel Prize]], although by then the different flavours of neutrino had already been theorized.&lt;ref&gt;I.V. Anicin (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tau (particle)|tau]] was first detected in a series of experiments between 1974 and 1977 by [[Martin Lewis Perl]] with his colleagues at the [[SLAC]] [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|LBL group]].&lt;ref&gt;M.L. Perl et al. (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Like the electron and the muon, it too was expected to have an associated neutrino. The first evidence for tau neutrinos came from the observation of "missing" energy and momentum in tau decay, analogous to the "missing" energy and momentum in beta decay leading to the discovery of the electron neutrino. The first detection of tau neutrino interactions was announced in 2000 by the [[DONUT]] collaboration at [[Fermilab]], making it the latest particle of the [[Standard Model]] to have been directly observed,&lt;ref name="obs"&gt;K. Kodama (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; apart from the [[Higgs boson]], which has been discovered in 2012.

Although all present data is consistent with three generations of leptons, some particle physicists are searching for a fourth generation. The current lower limit on the mass of such a fourth charged lepton is {{val|100.8|ul=GeV/c2}},&lt;ref&gt;C. Amsler et al. (2008) [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2008/listings/s025.pdf Heavy Charged Leptons Searches]&lt;/ref&gt; while its associated neutrino would have a mass of at least {{val|45.0|ul=GeV/c2}}.&lt;ref&gt;C. Amsler et al. (2008) [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2008/listings/s077.pdf Searches for Heavy Neutral Leptons]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==

===Spin and chirality===
[[File:Right left helicity.svg|thumb|200px|right|Left-handed and right-handed helicities]]

Leptons are [[spin (physics)|spin]]-{{frac|1|2}} particles. The [[spin-statistics theorem]] thus implies that they are [[fermion]]s and thus that they are subject to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]: No two leptons of the same species can be in exactly the same state at the same time. Furthermore, it means that a lepton can have only two possible spin states, namely up or down.

A closely related property is [[chirality (physics)|chirality]], which in turn is closely related to a more easily visualized property called [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]]. The helicity of a particle is the direction of its spin relative to its [[momentum]]; particles with spin in the same direction as their momentum are called ''right-handed'' and otherwise they are called ''left-handed''. When a particle is massless, the direction of its momentum relative to its spin is frame independent, while for massive particles it is possible to 'overtake' the particle by a [[Lorentz transformation]] flipping the helicity. Chirality is a technical property (defined through the transformation behaviour under the [[PoincarÃ© group]]) that agrees with helicity for (approximately) massless particles and is still well defined for massive particles.

In many [[quantum field theories]], such as [[quantum electrodynamics]] and [[quantum chromodynamics]], left- and right-handed fermions are identical. However, the Standard Model's [[Weak interaction]], treats left-handed and right-handed fermions are asymmetrically: Only left-handed fermions (and right-handed anti-fermions) participate in the [[weak interaction]]. This is an example of [[parity violation]] explicitly written into the model. In the literature, left-handed fields are often denoted by a capital ''L'' subscript (e.g. the normal electron:  e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) and right-handed fields are denoted by a capital ''R'' subscript (e.g. a positron  e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;big&gt;+&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).

Right-handed neutrinos and left-handed anti-neutrinos have no possible interaction with other particles (''see'' [[sterile neutrino]]s) and so are not a functional part of the Standard Model, although their exclusion is not a strict requirement; they are sometimes listed in particle tables to emphasize that they would have no active role if included in the model. Even though electrically charged particles (electron, muon, or tau) do not engage in the weak interaction specifically, they can still interact electrically, and hence still participate in the [[Electroweak unification|combined electro-weak force]], although with a different strengths ([[Weak hypercharge|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;W&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;]]).
{{clear}}

=== Electromagnetic interaction ===
[[File:Lepton-interaction-vertex-eeg.svg|thumb|portrait|right|Leptonâphoton interaction]]
One of the most prominent properties of leptons is their [[electric charge]], ''Q''. The electric charge determines the strength of their electromagnetic interactions. It determines the strength of the [[electric field]] generated by the particle (see [[Coulomb's law]]) and how strongly the particle reacts to an external electric or magnetic field (see [[Lorentz force]]). Each generation contains one lepton with ''Q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;â''e'' (conventionally the charge of a particle is expressed in units of the [[elementary charge]]) and one lepton with zero electric charge. The lepton with electric charge is commonly simply referred to as a 'charged lepton' while the neutral lepton is called a neutrino. For example, the first generation consists of the electron {{SubatomicParticle|electron}} with a negative electric charge and the electrically neutral electron neutrino {{SubatomicParticle|electron neutrino}}.

In the language of quantum field theory, the electromagnetic interaction of the charged leptons is expressed by the fact that the particles interact with the quantum of the electromagnetic field, the [[photon]]. The [[Feynman diagram]] of the electron-photon interaction is shown on the right.

Because leptons possess an intrinsic rotation in the form of their spin, charged leptons generate a magnetic field. The size of their [[magnetic dipole moment]] ''Î¼'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = g \frac{ Q \hbar}{4 m}, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the mass of the lepton and ''g'' is the so-called [[g-factor (physics)|g-factor]] for the lepton.  First order approximation quantum mechanics predicts that the g-factor is 2 for all leptons. However, higher order quantum effects caused by loops in Feynman diagrams introduce corrections to this value. These corrections, referred to as the [[anomalous magnetic dipole moment]], are very sensitive to the details of a quantum field theory model and thus provide the opportunity for precision tests of the standard model. The theoretical and measured values for the electron anomalous magnetic dipole moment are within agreement within eight significant figures.&lt;ref&gt;M.E. Peskin, D.V. Schroeder (1995), p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Standard Model, the left-handed charged lepton and the left-handed neutrino are arranged in [[Doublet (physics)|doublet]] {{nowrap|({{SubatomicParticle|electron neutrino}}&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, {{SubatomicParticle|electron}}&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)}} that transforms in the [[spinor]] representation (''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|2}}) of the [[weak isospin]] [[SU(2)]] gauge symmetry. This means that these particles are eigenstates of the isospin projection ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with eigenvalues {{frac|1|2}} and â{{frac|1|2}} respectively. In the meantime, the right-handed charged lepton transforms as a weak isospin scalar (''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) and thus does not participate in the weak interaction, while there is no evidence that a right-handed neutrino exists at all.

The [[Higgs mechanism]] recombines the gauge fields of the weak isospin SU(2) and the [[weak hypercharge]] U(1) symmetries to three massive vector bosons ({{SubatomicParticle|W boson+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson0}}) mediating the weak interaction, and one massless vector boson, the photon, responsible for the electromagnetic interaction. The electric charge ''Q'' can be calculated from the isospin projection ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and weak hypercharge ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; through the [[Gell-MannâNishijima formula]],
:''Q'' = ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Â½&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;''Y''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;
To recover the observed electric charges for all particles, the left-handed weak isospin doublet {{nowrap|({{SubatomicParticle|electron neutrino}}&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, {{SubatomicParticle|electron}}&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)}} must thus have ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;â1, while the right-handed isospin scalar e{{su|p=â|b=R}} must have ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;â2. The interaction of the leptons with the massive weak interaction vector bosons is shown in the figure on the left.

=== Mass ===
In the [[Standard Model]], each lepton starts out with no intrinsic mass. The charged leptons (i.e. the electron, muon, and tau) obtain an effective mass through interaction with the [[Higgs field]], but the neutrinos remain massless. For technical reasons, the masslessness of the neutrinos implies that there is no mixing of the different generations of charged leptons as [[CKM matrix|there is for quarks]]. This is in close agreement with current experimental observations.&lt;ref&gt;M.E. Peskin, D.V. Schroeder (1995), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is known from experimentsâmost prominently from observed [[neutrino oscillation]]s&lt;ref&gt;Y. Fukuda et al. (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;âthat neutrinos do in fact have some very small mass, probably less than {{val|2|ul=eV/c2}}.&lt;ref name="Neutrino"/&gt; This implies the existence of physics [[beyond the Standard Model]]. The currently most favoured extension is the so-called [[seesaw mechanism]], which would explain both why the left-handed neutrinos are so light compared to the corresponding charged leptons, and why we have not yet seen any right-handed neutrinos.

=== Leptonic numbers ===
{{Main article|Lepton number}}
The members of each generation's [[weak isospin]] [[doublet (physics)|doublet]] are assigned [[lepton number|leptonic numbers]] that are conserved under the Standard Model.&lt;ref name="MartinShaw"&gt;B.R. Martin, G. Shaw (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Electrons and electron neutrinos have an ''electronic number'' of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, while muons and muon neutrinos have a ''muonic number'' of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;Î¼&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, while tau particles and tau neutrinos have a ''tauonic number'' of  ''L''&lt;sub&gt;Ï&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. The antileptons have their respective generation's leptonic numbers of â1.

Conservation of the leptonic numbers means that the number of leptons of the same type remains the same, when particles interact. This implies that leptons and antileptons must be created in pairs of a single generation. For example, the following processes are allowed under conservation of leptonic numbers:{{clear}}
[[File:Lepton isodoublets fixed.png|thumb|right|Each generation forms a [[weak isospin]] [[Doublet (physics)|doublet]].]]
:{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Antielectron}} &amp;rarr; {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Photon}} +  {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Photon}},
:{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Tau}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Antitau}} &amp;rarr; {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Z boson0}} +  {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Z boson0}},

but not these:

:{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Photon}} &amp;rarr; {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Antimuon}},
:{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|W boson-}} &amp;rarr; {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Tau neutrino}},
:{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Z boson0}} &amp;rarr; {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Muon}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Antitau}}.

However, [[neutrino oscillation]]s are known to violate the conservation of the individual leptonic numbers. Such a violation is considered to be smoking gun evidence for [[Beyond the Standard Model|physics beyond the Standard Model]]. A much stronger conservation law is the conservation of the total number of leptons (''L''), conserved even in the case of neutrino oscillations, but even it is still violated by a tiny amount by the [[chiral anomaly]].

== Universality &lt;!--'Lepton universality' redirects here--&gt;==
The coupling of the leptons to [[gauge boson]]s are flavour-independent (i.e., the interactions between leptons and gauge bosons are the same for all leptons).&lt;ref name="MartinShaw"/&gt; This property is called '''lepton universality'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; and has been tested in measurements of the tau and muon [[mean lifetime|lifetime]]s and of [[Z boson]] partial [[decay width]]s, particularly at the [[Stanford Linear Collider]] (SLC) and [[Large Electron-Positron Collider]] (LEP) experiments.&lt;ref name="Cumalat1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. P. Cumalat|title=Physics in Collision 12|year=1993|publisher=Atlantica SÃ©guier FrontiÃ¨res|isbn=978-2-86332-129-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|241â243}}&lt;ref name="Fraser1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=G Fraser|title=The Particle Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgasJfizmocC|date=1 January 1998|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-5033-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|138}}

The decay rate (&lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;) of muons through the process {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|muon-}} â {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|electron-}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|electron antineutrino}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|muon neutrino}} is approximately given by an expression of the form (see [[muon decay]] for more details)&lt;ref name="MartinShaw"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \left ( \mu^- \rarr e^- + \bar{\nu_e} +\nu_\mu \right ) = K_1G_F^2m_\mu^5,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is some constant, and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Fermi coupling constant]]. The decay rate of tau particles through the process {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|tau-}} â {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|electron-}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|electron antineutrino}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|tau neutrino}} is given by an expression of the same form&lt;ref name="MartinShaw"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \left ( \tau^- \rarr e^- + \bar{\nu_e} +\nu_\tau \right ) = K_2G_F^2m_\tau^5,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is some constant. MuonâTauon universality implies that ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. On the other hand, electronâmuon universality implies&lt;ref name="MartinShaw"/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \left ( \tau^- \rarr e^- + \bar{\nu_e} +\nu_\tau \right ) = \Gamma \left ( \tau^- \rarr \mu^- + \bar{\nu_\mu} +\nu_\tau \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

This explains why the [[branching ratio]]s for the electronic mode (17.85%) and muonic (17.36%) mode of tau decay are equal (within error).&lt;ref name="Tauon"/&gt;

Universality also accounts for the ratio of muon and tau lifetimes. The lifetime of a lepton (''Ï''&lt;sub&gt;â&lt;/sub&gt;) is related to the decay rate by&lt;ref name="MartinShaw"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\tau_\ell=\frac{B \left ( \ell^- \rarr e^- + \bar{\nu_e} +\nu_\ell \right )}{\Gamma \left ( \ell^- \rarr e^- + \bar{\nu_e} +\nu_\ell \right )},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''B''(x â y) and &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;(x â y) denotes the branching ratios and the [[decay width|resonance width]] of the process x&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;y&amp;#x202f;.

The ratio of tau and muon lifetime is thus given by&lt;ref name="MartinShaw"/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\tau_\tau}{\tau_\mu} = \frac{B \left ( \tau^- \rarr e^- + \bar{\nu_e} +\nu_\tau \right )}{B \left ( \mu^- \rarr e^- + \bar{\nu_e} +\nu_\mu \right )}\left (\frac{m_\mu}{m_\tau}\right )^5.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the values of the 2008 ''[[Review of Particle Physics]]'' for the branching ratios of muons&lt;ref name="Muon"/&gt; and tau&lt;ref name="Tauon"/&gt; yields a lifetime ratio of ~{{val|1.29|e=-7}}, comparable to the measured lifetime ratio of ~{{val|1.32|e=-7}}. The difference is due to ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; not actually being constants: They depend on the mass of leptons.

Recent tests of lepton universality in [[B meson]] decays, performed by the [[LHCb]], [[BaBar experiment|BaBar]] and [[Belle experiment|Belle]] experiments, have shown consistent deviations from the Standard Model predictions. However the combined statitical and systematic significance is not yet high enough to claim an observation of [[new physics]].&lt;ref name=Ciezarek2017&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ciezarek G, Franco Sevilla M, Hamilton B, Kowalewski R, Kuhr T, LÃ¼th V, Sato Y |year=2017 |title=A challenge to lepton universality in B-meson decays |journal=Nature |volume=546 |issue= 7657|pages=227â233 |doi=10.1038/nature22346|pmid=28593973 |arxiv=1703.01766 |bibcode=2017Natur.546..227C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Life After People''''' is a television series on which [[scientists]], [[structural engineers]], and other experts speculate about what might become of Earth [[Human extinction|should humanity instantly disappear]]. The featured experts also talk about the impact of human absence on the environment and the vestiges of civilization thus left behind. The series was preceded by a two-hour special that aired on January 21, 2008 on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]&lt;ref name=special&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/minisites/life_after_people |title=Life After People â History.com TV Episodes, Schedule, &amp; Video |work=History.com |accessdate=August 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429170535/http://www.history.com/minisites/life_after_people/ |archivedate=April 29, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; which served as a de facto [[Television pilot|pilot]] for the series that premiered April 21, 2009. The documentary and subsequent series were both narrated by James Lurie.

==Format==
The program does not speculate on how humanity may disappear, stipulating only that it has, and that it has done so suddenly, leaving everything behind including household [[pets]] and [[livestock]] that have to fend for themselves. The [[thought experiment]] is based on documented results of the sudden removal of humans from a geographical area and the results that have occurred when people discontinue the maintenance of buildings and urban infrastructure. Lurie's narration begins:

{{cquote|What would happen if every human on Earth disappeared?  This ''isn't'' the story of how we might vanish...it's the story of what will happen to the world we leave behind}}

The series' episodes thematically offer examples of [[Urban decay|urban]] and [[Decomposition|biological decay]]. The focus is on specific locations such as [[skyscraper]]s, [[religious icons]], [[bridge]]s and [[dam]]s, and government buildings, and the fate of certain related objects, such as [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[document]]s and [[human body|human bodies]]. The fate of some kinds of [[plant|flora]] and [[animal|fauna]] are covered as well. Each episode also contains a segment in which experts examine real locations that have been abandoned by people, including [[ghost town]]s and other sites of deterioration, where the deterioration has been caused by events similar to those outlined in the episode. Although the series speculates on the fates of [[landmark]]s around the world, the main focus is on situations that may occur at locations in the United States.

The various events that may occur after people disappear suddenly are depicted using [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] dramatizations. The timeline of predicted events begins approximately one day after the disappearance of humankind and extends up to one hundred million years into the future (one day, one week, one year, 10 years, 15 years, 25 years, 50 years, 100 years, 200 years, etc.).

===Tagline===
The program's tagline is the ominous greeting:

{{cquote|Welcome to Earth...Population: Zero. [while all episodes end with the title fitting the last sentence,] ...in a life after people}}

[[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] is destroyed as ocean waves and hurricanes smash through casinos, break up the boardwalk and piers and tarnish the fate of [[Lucy the Elephant]]. Camels go wild in North America, like their ancestors, and are transformed after the next ice age. Over thousands of years, the [[Voyager Golden Record|''Voyager'']] space probes are battered by impacts from dust and debris, leaving few recognizable remnants of humanity behind. The episode also examines the [[Americana/Lesourdesville Lake Amusement Park|Americana Amusement Park]] in [[Monroe, Ohio]], showing how degraded it has become after only recently having been abandoned in 2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1997">In [[mathematics]], particularly [[topology]], collections of subsets are said to be locally discrete if they look like they have precisely one element from a local point of view. The study of locally discrete collections is worthwhile as [[Bing's metrization theorem]] shows.

==Formal definition==

Let ''X'' be a [[topological space]]. A collection {G&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;} of subsets of ''X'' is said to be locally discrete, if each point of the space has a [[neighbourhood]] intersecting at most one element of the collection. A collection of subsets of ''X'' is said to be countably locally discrete, if it is the countable union of locally discrete collections.

==Properties and examples==

1. Locally discrete collections are always [[Locally finite collection|locally finite]]. See the page on local finiteness.

2. If a collection of subsets of a topological space X is locally discrete, it must satisfy the property that each point of the space belongs to at most one element of the collection. This means that only collections of pairwise disjoint sets can be locally discrete. 

3. A [[Hausdorff space]] cannot have a locally discrete basis unless it is itself discrete. The same property holds for a [[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space]].

4. The following is known as Bing's metrization theorem:

A space ''X'' is metrizable iff it is regular and has a basis that is countably locally discrete.

5. A [[countable set|countable]] collection of sets is necessarily countably locally discrete. Therefore, if X is a metrizable space with a [[Second countable|countable basis]], one implication of Bing's metrization theorem holds. In fact, Bing's metrization theorem is almost a corollary of the [[Nagata-Smirnov metrization theorem|Nagata-Smirnov theorem]].

Gergen began her teaching career at [[Penn State]], Brandywine in 1984 as an assistant professor in Psychology and [[Women's studies]]. In 1988-89, Gergen was a fellow at the [[Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study]]. She won the [[George W. Atherton]] teaching award, a university wide honor, in 1966, and became a full professor. Gergen was given the title of [[Emeritus|Emerita]] upon retiring from the college in 2006.

In the early 1990s, she was one of the seven founders of The [[Taos Institute]], a non-profit organization dedicated to the development of [[social constructionist]] ideas within diverse practice areas, including therapy, organizational consulting, and education. She is a co-creator of the positive aging newsletter healthandage.com, an electronically distributed news source designed to reconstruct the negative stereotype of aging, and to provide an alternative that is more promising in potential. She also edits the ''Tempo Book'' series. Mary Gergen travels internationally to give lectures and workshops and serves on examination committees and as an external examiner for Ph.D. theses from many countries, in addition to supervising several doctoral dissertations and teaching in a theoretical psychology program at [[Massey University]], NZ.

== Work == 
Gergenâs  major contributions lie at the intersection of [[feminist theory]], and social constructionist ideas. Her attempt, at the outset, was to develop an alternative in studies of gender to both the hegemonic empiricist mode and the feminist standpoint orientation. This alternative grew from her engagement with social constructionist theory.

=== Towards a feminist methodology ===
Her first major effort to address this shift âTowards a feminist methodologyâ appeared in her edited book, ''Feminist Thought and the Structure of Knowledge'' in 1988.  Later, her reader, ''Toward a New Psychology of Gender'' (1997), edited with Sara N. Davis, attempted to exemplify the new potentials for the field. Her work on gender issues is primarily [[qualitative research|qualitative]], with a special emphasis on [[narrative methods]].  A major focus of this work has been on gendered narratives, and their implications for women's careers. Her interest in narrative has recently led her to a concern with narratives of nature, and the human-environmental connection.

=== Performative psychology ===
Gergen has also been innovating in developing a field of performative psychology, in which dramatic presentations are featured as a way of both carrying out research and communicating with peers and public. A pioneer of this approach in psychology, her first solo performance, âFrom Mod-Masculinity to Post-Mod Macho: A Feminist Re-playâ was presented at a symposium on âPostmodernity and Psychologyâ in Aarhus, [[Denmark]], June, 1989.  In her writing she also attempts to expand beyond conventional forms in order to bring forth multiple perspectives and to challenge existing forms of order.  Examples of this approach can be found in what may be her most important work, ''Reconstructing Psychology: Narrative, Gender and Performance'' (2001).

A '''Maure''', since the 11th century, is the [[symbol]] of a Moor's [[Human head|head]]. The term has [[Phoenicia]]n and [[Greek language|Greek]] origins; see [[Moors]].

== Flags, seals, and emblems ==
This symbol is used for political purposes.

=== The Maure ===
The Maure is the [[African Unification Front]]'s [[flag]] and [[emblem]].

=== Flag of Corsica ===
The main [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] in the coat of arms in [[Corsica]] is ''{{lang|co|U Moru}}'', [[Corsican language|Corsican]] for "The Moor", originally a female Moor blindfolded and wearing a necklace made of beads. An early version is attested in the 14th-century [[Gelre Armorial]], where an unblindfolded Moor's head represents Corsica as a state of the [[Crown of Aragon]]. In 1736, it was used by both sides during the struggle for independence.

In 1760, General [[Pasquale Paoli]] ordered the necklace to be removed from the head and the blindfold raised.  His reason, reported by his biographers, was ''"{{lang|fr|Les Corses veulent y voir clair. La libertÃ© doit marcher au flambeau de la philosophie. Ne dirait-on pas que nous craignons la lumiÃ¨re ?}}"'' ({{lang-en|"The Corsicans want to see clearly. Freedom must walk by the torch of philosophy. Won't they say that we fear the light?"}})  Later the blindfold was changed to a headband.

The current [[flag of Corsica]] is the ''{{lang|it|Bandera testa Mora}}'' ("{{lang|en|Flag with head of Maure}}"), is male rather than female, and has a regular knot at the back of the head.

=== Flag of Sardinia ===
The [[flag of Sardinia]] is informally known as ''the Four Moors'' ({{Lang-it|I quattro mori}}, {{Lang-src|Sos Bator Moros}}, {{Lang-sro|Is Cuatru Morus}}) and comprises four Moor heads.

{{Utilitarianism |expanded=Problems}}

The '''mere addition paradox''', also known as the '''repugnant conclusion''', is a problem in [[ethics]], identified by [[Derek Parfit]] and discussed in his book ''[[Reasons and Persons]]'' (1984). The paradox identifies the mutual incompatibility of four intuitively compelling assertions about the relative value of populations.

==The paradox==

Consider the four populations depicted in the following diagram: A, A+, Bâ and B. Each bar represents a distinct group of people, with the group's size represented by the bar's width and the [[happiness]] of each of the group's members represented by the bar's height. Unlike A and B, A+ and Bâ are complex populations, each comprising two distinct groups of people.

[[Image:MereAddition.svg|center]]

How do these populations compare in value? 

Parfit observes that i) A+ seems no worse than A. This is because the people in A are no worse-off in A+, while the additional people who exist in A+ are better off in A+ compared to A (if it is stipulated that their lives are good enough that living them is better than not existing).

Next, Parfit suggests that ii) Bâ seems better than A+. This is because Bâ has greater total and average happiness than A+.

Then, he notes that iii) B seems equally as good as Bâ, as the only difference between Bâ and B is that the two groups in Bâ are merged to form one group in B.

Together, these three comparisons entail that B is better than A. However, Parfit observes that when we directly compare A (a population with high average happiness) and B (a population with lower average happiness, but more total happiness because of its larger population), it may seem that B can be worse than A.

Thus, there is a paradox. The following intuitively plausible claims are jointly incompatible: (a) that A+ is no worse than A, (b) that Bâ is better than A+, (c) that Bâ is equally as good as B, and (d) that B can be worse than A.

==Criticisms and responses==
Some scholars, such as [[Larry Temkin]] and Stuart Rachels, argue that the apparent inconsistency between the four claims just outlined relies on the assumption that the "better than" relation is [[Transitive relation|transitive]]. We may resolve the inconsistency, thus, by rejecting the assumption. On this view, from the fact that A+ is no worse than A and that Bâ is better than A+ it simply does not follow that Bâ is better than A.

[[TorbjÃ¶rn TÃ¤nnsjÃ¶]] argues that the intuition that B is worse than A is wrong. While the lives of those in B are worse than those in A, there are more of them and thus the collective value of B is greater than A.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torbjorn|first=Tannsjo|date=January 2009|title=Why We Ought to Accept the Repugnant Conclusion|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/utilitas/article/why-we-ought-to-accept-the-repugnant-conclusion/F60DB3A1B9CA4460650EA5DF9AA0540D|journal=Utilitas|volume=14|pages=|doi=10.1017/S0953820800003642|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Huemer]] also argues that the repugnant conclusion is not repugnant and that normal intuition is wrong.&lt;ref name="huemer"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/heathwood/6100/Huemer%20-%20Defence%20of%20Repugnance.pdf| title=In Defence of Repugnance| first=Michael| last=Huemer| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109034025/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/heathwood/6100/Huemer%20-%20Defence%20of%20Repugnance.pdf| archivedate=2016-01-09| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the above discussion fails to appreciate the true source of repugnance. On the face of it, it may not be absurd to think that B is better than A. Suppose, then, that B is in fact better than A, as Huemer argues. It follows that this revised intuition must hold in subsequent iterations of the original steps. For example, the next iteration would add even more people to B+, and then take the average of the total happiness, resulting in C-. If these steps are repeated over and over, the eventual result will be Z, a massive population with the minimum level of average happiness; this would be a population in which every member is leading a life barely worth living. Z is the repugnant conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reasons and Persons|last=Parfit|first=Derek|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1984|isbn=019824908X|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative usage==
An alternative use of the term ''mere addition paradox'' was presented in a paper by Hassoun in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/working-papers/2010/en_GB/wp2010-120/ |title=Another Mere Addition Paradox? Some Reflections on Variable Population Poverty Measurement |publisher=UNU-WIDER |date=November 2010 |accessdate=31 March 2015 |isbn=978-92-9230-358-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It identifies paradoxical reasoning that occurs when certain statistical measures are used to calculate results over a population. For example, if a group of 100 people together control $100 worth of resources, the average wealth per capita is $1. If a single rich person then arrives with 1 million dollars, then the total group of 101 people controls $1,000,100, making average wealth per capita $9,901, implying a drastic shift away from poverty even though nothing has changed for the original 100 people. Hassoun defines a ''no mere addition axiom'' to be used for judging such statistical measures: "merely adding a rich person to a population should not decrease poverty" (although acknowledging that in actual practice adding rich people to a population may provide some benefit to the whole population).

This same argument can be generalized to many cases where proportional statistics are used: for example, a game sold on a download service may be considered a failure if less than 20% of those who download the demo then purchase the game. Thus, if 10,000 people download the demo of a game and 2,000 buy it, the game is a borderline success; however, it would be rendered a failure by an extra 500 people downloading the demo and not buying, even though this "mere addition" changes nothing with regard to income or consumer satisfaction from the previous situation.

'''Mill's Methods''' are five methods of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] described by [[philosopher]] [[John Stuart Mill]] in his 1843 book ''[[A System of Logic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Churchill |first=Robert Paul |title=Logic: An Introduction |year=1990 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=0-312-02353-7 |oclc=21216829 |edition=2nd |page=418 |quote=In his book ''A System of Logic'' (1843), Mill proposed four methods for testing causal hypotheses: the ''method of agreement'', the ''method of difference'', the ''joint method of agreement and difference'', and the ''method of concomitant variation''.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; (footnote 7: Mill also proposed a fifth method, which he called the method of residues.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are intended to illuminate issues of [[Causality|causation]].

==The methods==

===Direct method of agreement===
{{quote|text=''If two or more instances of the phenomenon under investigation have only one circumstance in common, the circumstance in which alone all the instances agree, is the cause (or effect) of the given phenomenon. ''|sign=John Stuart Mill|source={{cite book |title=A System of Logic, Vol. 1 |year=1843 |page=454 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y4MEAAAAQAAJ&amp;vq=method%20of%20agreement&amp;pg=PA454#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}}}
For a property to be a [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary]] condition it must always be present if the effect is present. Since this is so, then we are interested in looking at cases where the effect is present and taking note of which properties, among those considered to be 'possible necessary conditions' are present and which are absent. Obviously, any properties which are absent when the effect is present cannot be necessary conditions for the effect. This method is also referred to more generally within comparative politics as the most different systems design.
Symbolically, the method of agreement can be represented as:
: A B C D occur together with w x y z
: A E F G occur together with w t u v
: ââââââââââââââââââ
: Therefore A is the cause, or the effect, of w.
To further illustrate this concept, consider two structurally different countries. Country A is a former colony, has a centre-left government, and has a federal system with two levels of government. Country B has never been a colony, has a centre-left government and is a unitary state. One factor that both countries have in common, the [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]] in this case, is that they have a system of [[universal health care]]. Comparing the factors known about the countries above, a comparative political scientist would conclude that the government sitting on the centre-left of the spectrum would be the independent variable which causes a system of universal health care, since it is the only one of the factors examined which holds constant between the two countries, and the theoretical backing for that relationship is sound; social democratic (centre-left) policies often include universal health care.

===Method of difference===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Corroborating evidence]] --&gt;
{{quote|text=''If an instance in which the phenomenon under investigation occurs, and an instance in which it does not occur, have every circumstance save one in common, that one occurring only in the former; the circumstance in which alone the two instances differ, is the effect, or cause, or a necessary part of the cause, of the phenomenon. ''|sign=John Stuart Mill|source={{cite book |title=A System of Logic, Vol. 1 |year=1843 |page=455 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y4MEAAAAQAAJ&amp;vq=method%20of%20agreement&amp;pg=PA454#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}}}

This method is also known more generally as the most similar systems design within comparative politics.

: A B C D occur together with w x y z
: B C D occur together with x y z
: ââââââââââââââââââ
: Therefore A is the cause, or the effect, or a part of the cause of w.

As an example of the method of difference, consider two similar countries. Country A has a centre-right government, a unitary system and was a former colony. Country B has a centre-right government, a unitary system but was never a colony. The difference between the countries is that Country A readily supports anti-colonial initiatives, whereas Country B does not. The method of difference would identify the independent variable to be the status of each country as a former colony or not, with the dependant variable being support for anti-colonial initiatives. This is because, out of the two similar countries compared, the difference between the two is whether or not they were formerly a colony. This then explains the difference on the values of the dependent variable, with the former colony being more likely to support decolonization than the country with no history of being a colony.

===Joint method of agreement and difference===
{{quote|text=''If two or more instances in which the phenomenon occurs have only one circumstance in common, while two or more instances in which it does not occur have nothing in common save the absence of that circumstance; the circumstance in which alone the two sets of instances differ, is the effect, or cause, or a necessary part of the cause, of the phenomenon. ''|sign=John Stuart Mill|source={{cite book |title=A System of Logic, Vol. 1 |year=1843 |page=463 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y4MEAAAAQAAJ&amp;vq=method%20of%20agreement&amp;pg=PA462#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}}}

Also called simply the "joint method, " this principle simply represents the application of the methods of agreement and difference.

Symbolically, the Joint method of agreement and difference can be represented as:

: A B C occur together with x y z
: A D E occur together with x v w also B C occur with y z
: ââââââââââââââââââ
: Therefore A is the cause, or the effect, or a part of the cause of x.

===Method of residue===
{{quote|text=''Subduct&lt;ref&gt;"Subduct" is an archaic word meaning "take away" or "subtract".&lt;/ref&gt; from any phenomenon such part as is known by previous inductions to be the effect of certain antecedents, and the residue of the phenomenon is the effect of the remaining antecedents. ''|sign=John Stuart Mill|source={{cite book |title=A System of Logic, Vol. 1 |year=1843 |page=465 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y4MEAAAAQAAJ&amp;vq=method%20of%20agreement&amp;pg=PA464#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}}}

If a range of factors are believed to cause a range of phenomena, and we have matched all the factors, except one, with all the phenomena, except one, then the remaining phenomenon can be attributed to the remaining factor.

Symbolically, the Method of Residue can be represented as:

: A B C occur together with x y z
: B is known to be the cause of y
: C is known to be the cause of z
: ââââââââââââââââââ
: Therefore A is the cause or effect of x.

===Method of concomitant variations===
{{quote|text=''Whatever phenomenon varies in any manner whenever another phenomenon varies in some particular manner, is either a cause or an effect of that phenomenon, or is connected with it through some fact of causation. ''|sign=John Stuart Mill|source={{cite book |title=A System of Logic, Vol. 1 |year=1843 |page=470 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y4MEAAAAQAAJ&amp;vq=method%20of%20agreement&amp;pg=PA470#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}}}

If across a range of circumstances leading to a phenomenon, some property of the phenomenon varies in tandem with some factor existing in the circumstances, then the phenomenon can be associated with that factor. For instance, suppose that various samples of water, each containing both [[salt]] and [[lead]], were found to be toxic. If the level of toxicity varied in tandem with the level of lead, one could attribute the toxicity to the presence of lead.

Symbolically, the method of concomitant variation can be represented as (with Â± representing a shift):

{{italic title}}
{{Nihongo3||ç©ã®åã|'''Mono no aware'''}}, literally "the pathos of things", and also translated as "an empathy toward things", or "a sensitivity to ephemera", is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for the awareness of {{nihongo|[[impermanence]]|ç¡å¸¸|mujÅ}}, or transience of things, and both a transient gentle sadness (or wistfulness) at their passing as well as a longer, deeper gentle sadness about this state being the reality of life.

==Origins==
The term comes from Heian period literature, but was picked up and used by 18th century [[Edo period]] Japanese cultural scholar [[Motoori Norinaga]] in his literary criticism of ''[[The Tale of Genji]],'' and later to other seminal Japanese works including the ''[[Man'yÅshÅ«]]''. It became central to his philosophy of literature and eventually to [[Culture of Japan|Japanese cultural tradition]].

==Etymology==
The phrase is derived from the Japanese word {{nihongo3||ç©|mono}}, which means "thing", and {{nihongo3||åã|aware}}, which was a [[Heian period]] expression of measured surprise (similar to "ah" or "oh"), translating roughly as "pathos", "poignancy", "deep feeling", "sensitivity", or "awareness".  Thus, ''mono no aware'' has frequently been translated as "the 'ahh-ness' of things", life, and love. Awareness of the transience of all things heightens appreciation of their beauty, and evokes a gentle sadness at their passing. In his criticism of ''The Tale of Genji'' Motoori noted that ''mono no aware'' is the crucial emotion that moves readers. Its scope was not limited to [[Japanese literature]], and became associated with Japanese cultural tradition (see also ''[[sakura]]'').&lt;ref name=khoon&gt;Choy Lee, Khoon. ''Japan: Between Myth and Reality''. 1995, page 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In contemporary culture==
Notable [[manga]] artists who use ''mono no aware''âstyle storytelling include [[Hitoshi Ashinano]], [[Kozue Amano]], and [[Kaoru Mori]]. In [[anime]], both ''[[Only Yesterday (1991 film)|Only Yesterday]]'' by [[Isao Takahata]] and ''[[Mai Mai Miracle]]'' by [[Sunao Katabuchi]] emphasize the passing of time in gentle notes and by presenting the main plot against a parallel one from the past.  The Japanese director [[YasujirÅ Ozu]] was well known for creating a sense of ''mono no aware'', frequently climaxing with a character very understatedly saying {{nihongo3|"Fine weather, isn't it?"|ããå¤©æ°ã§ãã­|''"''Ii tenki desu ne''?"''}}, after a familial and societal paradigm shift, such as a daughter being married off, against the backdrop of a swiftly changing Japan. Ozu has often expressed feelings by showing the faces of objects rather than the face of an actor. Some examples include two fathers contemplating the rocks in a "dry landscape" garden, and a mirror reflecting the absence of the daughter who has just left home after getting married. These images exemplified ''mono no aware'' as powerfully as the expression on the greatest actor's face.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/japanese-aesthetics/|title=2.

In his book about courtly life in [[ancient Japan]], ''The World of the Shining Prince'', [[Ivan Morris]] compares ''mono no aware'' to [[Virgil]]'s term ''[[lacrimae rerum]]'', Latin for "tears of things".&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Ivan I. ''The World of the Shining Prince: Court Life in Ancient Japan''. 1994, page 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Science fiction]] author [[Ken Liu]]'s short story, "Mono no Aware", won the 2013 [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2013 Hugo Awards |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2013-hugo-awards/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906045317/http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2013-hugo-awards/ |archivedate=2015-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by works like the science fiction manga ''[[Yokohama Kaidashi KikÅ]]'', Liu sought to evoke an "aesthetic primarily oriented towards creating in the reader an empathy towards the inevitable passing of all things", and to acknowledge "the importance of memory and continuity with the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mamatas |first=Nick |title=Q/A With Ken Liu (and the return of Intern Kathleen) |url=http://www.haikasoru.com/the-future-is-japanese/qa-with-ken-liu-and-the-return-of-intern-kathleen/ |publisher=Haikasoru |accessdate=7 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530040356/http://www.haikasoru.com/the-future-is-japanese/qa-with-ken-liu-and-the-return-of-intern-kathleen/ |archivedate=30 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel]]- and [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]]-winning British novelist [[Kazuo Ishiguro]] ends many of his novels without any sense of resolution. The issues his characters confront are buried in the past and remain unresolved. Thus Ishiguro ends many of his novels on a note of melancholic resignation. His characters accept their past and who they have become, typically discovering that this realization brings comfort and an ending to mental anguish. This can be seen as a literary reflection of the Japanese idea of ''mono no aware''.

Films like [[Alain Resnais]]'s ''[[Hiroshima Mon Amour]]'', [[ Shohei Imamura]]'s ''[[Black Rain (1989 Japanese film)|Black Rain]]'' and [[ Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[I Live in Fear]]'' have all been associated with the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crosscurrents.org/FeleppaSpring2004.htm|title=BLACK RAIN: Reflections on Hiroshima and Nuclear War in Japanese Film|author=|date=|website=www.crosscurrents.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030174259/http://www.crosscurrents.org/FeleppaSpring2004.htm|archivedate=30 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most well-known examples of ''mono no aware'' in contemporary Japan is the traditional love of cherry blossoms, found throughout Japanese art and perpetuated by the large masses of people that travel annually to view and picnic under cherry trees. The trees are not considered to be of special value concerning their beauty in relation to other trees, such as apple or pear trees. Cherry tree blossoms are valued because of their transience, normally associated with the fact that the blossoms fall off the tree after only a week or so after first budding. It is the evanescence of the beauty of the cherry blossom that evokes the weary perspective of ''mono no aware'' in the viewer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:Burning-14.jpg|thumb|300px|Preparing to burn a witch in 1544. [[Witch-hunt]]s are an example of mass behavior fueled by moral panic.]]

A '''moral panic''' is a feeling of [[fear]] spread among a large number of people that some [[evil]] threatens the well-being of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panics and Mass Hysteria|url=https://sites.google.com/site/formsofcollectivebehavior/panics-and-mass-hysteria|website=FormsOfCollectiveBehavior|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Jones&gt;see also: Jones, M, and E.  Jones. (1999). ''Mass Media.'' London: Macmillan Press&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Dictionary of Sociology'' defines a moral panic as "the process of arousing social concern over an issue â usually the work of [[moral entrepreneur]]s and the [[mass media]]".&lt;ref name=Oxford_Uni&gt;{{Citation | contribution = M: Moral panic | editor-last = Scott | editor-first = John | editor-link = John Scott (sociologist) | title = A dictionary of sociology | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | page = 492 | location = Oxford New York | year = 2014 | isbn = 9780199683581 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=2zr_AwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover Book preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The media are key players in the dissemination of moral indignation, even when they do not appear to be consciously engaged in [[crusading]] or [[Muckraker|muckraking]]. Simply reporting the facts can be enough to generate concern, anxiety, or panic.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]] states that moral panic happens when "a condition, episode, person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to societal values and interests." Examples of moral panic include the belief in widespread abduction of children by predatory [[pedophilia|paedophiles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hesselink-Louw | first1 = Anne | last2 = Olivier | first2 = Karen | year = 2001 | title = A criminological analysis of crimes against disabled children: the adult male sexual offender | url = | journal = CARSA | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 15â20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520262065 |title=Sex Panic and the Punitive State |last=Lancaster |first=Roger |publisher=University of California Press |year=2011 |isbn=9780520262065 |location=Berkeley |pages=4, 33â34, 76â79.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Extein&gt;{{cite news |last1=Extein |first1=Andrew |title=Fear the Bogeyman: Sex Offender Panic on Halloween |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrew-extein-msw/fear-the-bogeyman-sex-off_b_4161136.html |accessdate=26 November 2014 |work=Huffington Post |date=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; belief in [[Satanic ritual abuse|ritual abuse of women and children by satanic cults]],&lt;ref name="Goode"&gt;{{cite book |title=Moral Panics: The Social Construction of Deviance |last2=Ben-Yehuda |first2=Nachman |publisher=Blackwell |year=2009 |isbn=9781405189347 |edition=2nd |location=Oxford |pages=57â65 |author-link2=Nachman Ben-Yehuda |last1=Goode |first1=Erich |author-link1=Erich Goode |origyear=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[War on Drugs]],&lt;ref name="DR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thersa.org/action-research-centre/current-projects/drugs-commission/drugs-report |title=Drugs Report |date=March 2007 |publisher=[[Royal Society of Arts]] Action and Research Centre |accessdate=24 November 2014}} [http://www.rsadrugscommission.org.uk/pdf/RSA_Drugs_Report.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[public health]] issues.

== Use as a social science term ==
[[Marshall McLuhan]] gave the term academic treatment in his book ''[[Understanding Media]]'', written in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McLuhan | first = Marshall | author-link = Marshall McLuhan | title = [[Understanding Media|Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]] | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1994 }} {{ISBN|9780262631594}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stanley Cohen, author of a sociological study about youth culture and media called ''Folk Devils and Moral Panics'' (1972),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hayes | first1 = Hennessey | last2 = Prenzler | first2 = Tim | title = Introduction to Crime and Criminology | publisher = Pearson Australia | location = Frenchs Forest, New South Wales | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781442545243 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a moral panic occurs when "...[a] condition, episode, person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to [[society|societal values]] and interests".&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;{{cite book | last = Cohen | first = Stanley | author-link = Stanley Cohen (sociologist) | title = Folk Devils and Moral Panics: The Creation of the Mods and Rockers | doi=10.4324/9780203828250 | url=https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203828250 | isbn= 9781138834743 | publisher = Paladin | year = 1973 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who start the panic when they fear a threat to prevailing social or [[cultural]] values are known by researchers as '[[moral entrepreneur]]s', while people who supposedly threaten the social order have been described as '[[folk devil]]s'.

===British vs. American===
Many sociologists have pointed out the differences between definitions of a ''moral panic'' as described by American versus British sociologists. In addition to pointing out other sociologists who note the distinction, Kenneth Thompson has characterized the difference as American sociologists tending to emphasize psychological factors while the British portray "moral panics" as [[crisis of capitalism|crises of capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Thompson | first1 = Kenneth | contribution = The History and Meaning of the Concept | editor-last = Critcher | editor-first = Chas | title = Critical Readings: Moral Panics and the Media | publisher = Open University Press | pages = 60â66 | location = Maidenhead England New York | year = 2006 | origyear = 1998 | isbn = 9780335218073 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = Kenneth | title = Moral Panics | publisher = Routledge | location = London &amp; New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780415119771 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

British criminologist [[Jock Young]] used the term in his participant observation study of drug taking in [[Porthmadog]] between 1967 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Young | first1 = Jock | author-link1 = Jock Young | contribution = The role of the police as amplifiers of deviance | editor-last = Cohen | editor-first = Stanley | editor-link = Stanley Cohen (sociologist) | title = Images of Deviance | publisher = Penguin | pages = | location = Harmondsworth | year = 1971 | isbn = 9780140212938 }}; {{cite book | last = Young | first = Jock | title = The Drugtakers: The Social Meaning of Drug Use | publisher = MacGibbon and Kee | location = London | year = 1971 | isbn = 9780261632400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Policing the Crisis: Mugging, the State and Law and Order'' (1978), [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] and his colleagues studied the public reaction to the phenomenon of [[robbery|mugging]] and the perception that it had recently been imported from American culture into the UK. Employing Cohen's definition of 'moral panic', Hall ''et al.'' theorized that the "...rising crime rate equation..." performs an ideological function relating to [[social control]]. [[Crime statistics]], in Hall's view, are often manipulated for political and economic purposes; moral panics could thereby be ignited to create public support for the need to "...police the crisis".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hall | first1 = Stuart | author-link1 = Stuart Hall (cultural theorist) | title = Policing the Crisis: Mugging, the State and Law and Order | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York | year = 2013 | origyear = 1978 | isbn = 9781137007186 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cohen's stages of moral panic==
According to [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]],&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; who seems to have borrowed the term from Marshall McLuhan (see above), there are five key stages in the construction of a moral panic:
#Someone, something or a group are defined as a threat to social norms or community interests
#The threat is then depicted in a simple and recognizable symbol/form by the media
#The portrayal of this symbol rouses public concern
#There is a response from authorities and policy makers
#The moral panic over the issue results in social changes within the community

In 1971 Stanley Cohen investigated a series of "moral panics". Cohen used the term "moral panic" to characterize the reactions of the media, the public, and agents of social control to youth disturbances.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; This work, involving the [[Mods and rockers|Mods and Rockers]], demonstrated how agents of social control amplified deviance. According to Cohen, these groups were labeled as being outside the central core values of consensual society and as posing a threat to both the values of society and society itself, hence the term "folk devils".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Donna |last1=Killingbeck |year=2001 |title=The role of television news in the construction of school violence as a 'moral panic' |journal=Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=186â202 |url=http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol8is3/killingbeck.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more recent edition of ''Folk Devils and Moral Panics,'' Cohen outlines some of the criticisms that have arisen in response to moral panic theory. One of these is of the term "panic" itself, as it has connotations of irrationality and a lack of control. Cohen maintains that "panic" is a suitable term when used as an extended metaphor.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;

==Mass media==
According to Stanley Cohen in ''Folk Devils and Moral Panics'', the concept of "moral panic" was linked to certain assumptions about the mass media.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; Stanley Cohen showed that the mass media are the primary source of the public's knowledge about deviance and social problems. He further argued that moral panic gives rise to the folk devil by labeling actions and people.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;

According to Cohen, the media appear in any or all three roles in moral panic dramas:&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;
* Setting the agenda â selecting deviant or socially problematic events deemed as newsworthy, then using finer filters to select which events are candidates for moral panic.
* Transmitting the images â transmitting the claims by using the rhetoric of moral panics.
* Breaking the silence and making the claim.

==Characteristics==
Moral panics have several distinct features. According to Goode and Ben-Yehuda, moral panic consists of the following characteristics:&lt;ref name=Goode/&gt;
* Concern â There must be the belief that the behaviour of the group or activity deemed deviant is likely to have a negative effect on society.
* Hostility  â Hostility toward the group in question increases, and they become "folk devils". A clear division forms between "them" and "us".
* Consensus â Though concern does not have to be nationwide, there must be widespread acceptance that the group in question poses a very real threat to society. It is important at this stage that the "moral entrepreneurs" are vocal and the "folk devils" appear weak and disorganized.
* Disproportionality â The action taken is disproportionate to the actual threat posed by the accused group.
* Volatility â Moral panics are highly volatile and tend to disappear as quickly as they appeared because public interest wanes or news reports change to another narrative.&lt;ref name = Jones/&gt;

==Examples==
&lt;!-- Note: Please do not make NEW ADDITIONS to this section unless you have a reference that cites the incident or phenomenon as an EXAMPLE OF A MORAL PANIC. --&gt;

===20thâ21st century: public health===
The fear of disease (or fear of threats to [[public health]]) and spread of panic dates back many centuries and continues into the 21st century with diseases such as [[AIDS]], [[Ebola]], [[H1N1]], [[Zika]], and [[SARS]]. Cohen's idea of the "folk devil"&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; and epidemics can be compared because of their role in spreading mass panic and fear. The intense concentration on hygiene emerged, before the 20th century, with a medical belief referred to as [[miasma theory]], which states that disease was the direct result of the polluting emanations of filth: sewer gas, garbage fumes, and stenches that polluted air and water, which results in an epidemic. The [[Great Stink]] of 1858 was blamed on miasma, along with reoccurring [[cholera]] epidemics during the [[Victorian era]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halliday|first=Stephen|date=22 December 2001|title=Death and miasma in Victorian London: an obstinate belief|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|volume=323|issue=7327|pages=1469â1471|issn=0959-8138|pmc=1121911|pmid=11751359|doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7327.1469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the water was safe to drink in most parts of London, such a panic had arisen that very few people would dare drink the water.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== 1950s: switchblades ===
In the United States, a 1950 article titled "The Toy That Kills" in the ''Women's Home Companion'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pollack, Jack H., ''The Toy That Kills'', 77 Women's Home Companion Magazine 38, November 1950&lt;/ref&gt; about automatic knives, or "[[switchblade]]s", sparked a storm of controversy, further fed by highly popular films of the late 1950s including ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'', ''[[Crime in the Streets]]'', ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'', ''[[The Delinquents (1957 film)|The Delinquents]]'', ''[[High School Confidential (film)|High School Confidential]]'', and the 1957 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]''. Fixation on the switchblade as the symbol of youth violence, sex, and delinquency resulted in demands from the public and Congress to control the sale and possession of such knives.&lt;ref name="TWFK"&gt;{{Citation | surname=Dick | given=Steven| title=The Working Folding Knife | year=1997| publisher= Stoeger Publishing Company |ISBN= 978-0-88317-210-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LEV"&gt;Levine, Bernard R., ''[http://www.knife-expert.com/schr-pb.txt The Switchblade Menace]'', OKCA Newsletter (1993): Rep. [[Sidney R. Yates]] (D) of Illinois was convinced of a sadistic connection, proclaiming that "vicious fantasies of omnipotence, idolatry...barbaric and sadistic atrocities, and monstrous violations of accepted values spring from [switchblades]&amp;nbsp;... Minus switchblade knives and the distorted feeling of power they begetâpower that is swaggering, reckless, and itching to express itself in violenceâour delinquent adolescents would be shorn of one of their most potent means of incitement to crime".&lt;/ref&gt; State laws restricting or criminalizing switchblade possession and use were adopted by an increasing number of state legislatures, and many of the [[Switchblade#Legality|restrictive laws around them]] worldwide date back to this period.

=== 1970sâpresent: increase in crime ===
Research shows that fear of increasing crime is often the cause of moral panics.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goode 2009 217"&gt;{{cite book |title=Moral Panics: The Social Construction of Deviance |last2=Ben-Yehuda |first2=Nachman |publisher=Blackwell |year=2009 |isbn=9781405189347 |edition=2nd |location=Oxford |page=217 |author-link2=Nachman Ben-Yehuda |last1=Goode |first1=Erich |author-link1=Erich Goode |origyear=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byron, Reginald; Molidor, William; Cantu, Andrew (2018).

===1970sâpresent: video games and violence===
{{main|Video game controversy}}

There have been calls to regulate violence in [[video game]]s for nearly as long as the video game industry has existed, with ''[[Death Race (1976 video game)|Death Race]]'' a notable early example.&lt;ref name="byrd"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=Summer 2007 |title=Comment: It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt: the effectiveness of proposed video-game legislation on reducing violence in children |url=http://www.houstonlawreview.org/archive/downloads/44-2_pdf/5_Byrd.pdf |journal=Houston Law Review |publisher=Houston Law Foundation |last1=Byrd |first1=Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kocurek"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koucurek |first=Carly |date=September 2012 |title=The Agony and the Exidy: A History of Video Game Violence and the Legacy of Death Race |url=http://gamestudies.org/1201/articles/carly_kocurek |volume=12 |issue=1 |work=Game Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, however, improvements in video game technology allowed for more lifelike depictions of violence in games like ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' and ''[[Doom (game)|Doom]]''. The industry attracted controversy over violent content and concerns about [[influence of mass media|effects]] they might have on players, generating frequent media stories drawing connections between video games and violent behavior as well as a number of academic studies reporting conflicting findings about the strength of correlations.&lt;ref name="byrd" /&gt; According to Christopher Ferguson, sensationalist media reports and the scientific community unintentionally worked together in "promoting an unreasonable fear of violent video games".&lt;ref name="scotus"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2013 |title=Violent video games and the Supreme Court: Lessons for the scientific community in the wake of Brown v.

Since the 1990s, there have been attempts to regulate violent video games in the United States through congressional bills as well as within the industry.&lt;ref name="byrd" /&gt; Public concern and media coverage of violent video games reached a high point following the [[Columbine High School massacre]] in 1999, after which videos were found of the perpetrators talking about violent games like ''Doom'' and making comparisons between the acts they intended to carry out and aspects of games.&lt;ref name="byrd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scotus" /&gt;

Ferguson and others have explained the video game moral panic as part of a cycle that all new media go through.&lt;ref name="scotus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fergusonapa"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2010 |title=Blazing angels or resident evil?

===1970sâpresent: war on drugs===

Some critics have pointed to moral panic as an explanation for the [[War on Drugs]]. For example, a [[Royal Society of Arts]] commission concluded that "the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]] ... is driven more by 'moral panic' than by a practical desire to reduce harm."&lt;ref name="DR" /&gt;

Some have written that one of the many rungs supporting the moral panic behind the war on drugs was a separate but related moral panic, which peaked in the late 1990s, involving media's gross exaggeration of the [[Date rape drug#Media coverage|frequency of the surreptitious use of date rape drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Synthetic Panics: The Symbolic Politics of Designer Drugs |last=Jenkins |first=Philip |publisher=New York University Press |year=1999 |isbn=9780814742440 |location=New York, New York |pages=20 and 161â182 |author-link=Philip Jenkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goode 2009 217" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Psychology &amp; Crime |last=Webber |first=Craig |publisher=Sage |year=2010 |isbn=9781412919425 |location=Los Angeles &amp; London |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; News media have been criticized for advocating "grossly excessive protective measures for women, particularly in coverage between 1996 and 1998," for overstating the threat and for excessively dwelling on the topic.&lt;ref name="Goode 2009 217" /&gt; For example, a 2009 Australian study found that drug panel tests were unable to detect any drug in any of the 97 instances of patients admitted to the hospital believing their drinks might have been spiked.&lt;ref name="Quigley 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Lynch |first2=Dania M. |last3=Little |first3=Mark |last4=Murray |first4=Lindsay |last5=Lynch |first5=Ann-Maree |last6=O'Halloran |first6=Sean J. |year=2009 |title=Prospective study of 101 patients with suspected drink spiking |journal=Emergency Medicine Australasia |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=222 |doi=10.1111/j.1742-6723.2009.01185.x |pmid=19527282 |last1=Quigley |first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980sâ1990s: ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''===
{{main|Dungeons &amp; Dragons controversies}}
At various times, ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' and other [[tabletop role-playing game]]s have been accused of promoting such practices as [[Satanism]], [[witchcraft]], [[suicide]], [[pornography]] and [[murder]]. In the 1980s and later, some groups, especially [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] Christian groups, accused the games of encouraging interest in [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and the veneration of [[demon]]s.&lt;ref name="panic"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2005 |title=Role-Playing Games and the Christian Right: Community Formation in Response to a Moral Panic |journal=The Journal of Religion and Popular Culture |volume=9 |pages=3 |doi=10.3138/jrpc.9.1.003 |last1=Waldron |first1=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many of these criticisms have been aimed specifically at ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', they touch on the genre of [[fantasy]] [[roleplaying game]]s as a whole.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===1980sâ1990s: Satanic ritual abuse===
{{Main|Satanic ritual abuse}}
Also known as the "satanic panic", this was a series of moral panics regarding Satanic ritual abuse that originated in the United States and spread to other English-speaking countries in the 1980s and 1990s, and led to a string of wrongful convictions.&lt;ref name="Goode" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{cite book |title=Moral Panic: Changing Concepts of the Child Molester in Modern America |last=Jenkins |first=Philip |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1998 |isbn=9780300109634 |location=New Haven, Connecticut |pages=207â231 |author-link=Philip Jenkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Satanic Panic: The Creation of a Contemporary Legend |last=Victor |first=Jeffrey S. |publisher=[[Open Court Publishing Company]] |year=1993 |isbn=9780812691917 |location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Day Care Ritual Abuse Moral Panic |last=Young |first=Mary |publisher=McFarland |year=2004 |isbn=9780786418305 |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |authorlink=Mary de Young}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1980sâpresent: HIV/AIDS ===

[[HIV/AIDS|Acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS) may lead to or exacerbate other health conditions such as [[pneumonia]], [[fungal infection]]s, [[tuberculosis]], [[toxoplasmosis]], and [[cytomegalovirus]]. A meeting of the [[British Sociological Association]]'s South West and Wales Study entitled "AIDS: The Latest Moral Panic" was prompted by the growing interest of medical sociologists in [[AIDS]], as well as that of UK health care professionals working in the field of health education. It took place at a time when both groups were beginning to voice an increased concern with the growing media attention and [[Fearmongering|fear-mongering]] that AIDS was attracting.&lt;ref name="ATLMP"&gt;Gilligan, J. H., and Coxon, A. P. M. (eds.), 1985, ''AIDS: The Latest Moral Panic, Occasional Paper No 11'', December, The School of Social Studies, University College of Swansea{{page needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, a moral panic was created within the media over HIV/AIDS. In Britain the notable iceberg advert by the government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pemberton |first1=Max |title=HIV/Aids treatment has come a long way - in the West |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/sexual-health-and-advice/9715372/HIVAids-treatment-has-come-a-long-way-in-the-West.html |accessdate=14 June 2017 |work=The Telegraph |date=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; clearly hinted that the public was uninformed about HIV/AIDS due to a lack of publicly assessable and accurate information.

The media outlets nicknamed HIV/AIDS the "gay plague", causing further stigmatization and misunderstandings about the disease. However, scientists gained a far better understanding of HIV/AIDS as it grew in the 1980s and moved into the 1990s and beyond. The illness was still negatively viewed by many as either caused by, or passed on through, the gay community. Once it became clear that this wasn't the case, the moral panic created by the media changed to blaming the overall negligence of ethical standards of the younger generation (both male and female), resulting in another moral panic. It is prevalent in the media{{Clarify|reason=Vague usage of the word "it"|date=March 2017}} and the way HIV/AIDS is depicted taken from this extract, "British TV and press coverage is locked into an agenda which blocks out any approach to the subject which does not conform in advance to the values and language of a profoundly homophobic culture-a culture that is which does not regard gay men as fully or properly human. No distinction obtains for the agenda between 'quality' and 'tabloid' newspapers, or between 'popular' and 'serious' television."&lt;ref&gt;Aggleton, P., Davies, P., &amp; Hart, G. (1992). ''AIDS: Rights, Risk, and Reason''. London: Falmer Press. {{ISBN|9780750700405}}{{page needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, blame shifted to "uncivilized Africans" as the new "folk devils", with a popular theory alleging that HIV originated from humans having sex with [[simian]]s. This theory was debunked by numerous experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Did AIDS come from having sex with monkeys? | date = 25 November 1998 | author = Rick Sowadsky | url = http://www.thebody.com/Forums/AIDS/SafeSex/Q8781.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1990sâpresent: sex offenders ===

The media narrative of a [[sex offender]] highlighting egregious offenses as typical behavior of any sex offender, and media distorting the facts of some cases,&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2012 |title=Incurable Sex Offenders, Lousy Judges &amp; the Media: Moral Panic Sustenance in the Age of New Media |journal=American Journal of Criminal Justice |volume=38|pages=160 |doi=10.1007/s12103-012-9154-6 |last1=Fox |first1=Kathryn J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; has led legislators to attack [[judicial discretion]],&lt;ref name="Fox" /&gt; making sex offender registration mandatory based on certain listed offenses rather than individual risk or the actual severity of the crime, thus practically catching less serious offenders under the domain of harsh sex offender laws.

In the 1990s and 2000s, there have been instances of moral panics in the UK and the US related to colloquial uses of the term [[pedophilia]] to refer to such unusual crimes as high-profile cases of [[child abduction]].&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt;

=== 2000âpresent: human trafficking ===

Many critics of contemporary anti-prostitution activism argue that much of the current concern about [[human trafficking]] and its more general conflation with [[prostitution]] and other forms of [[sex work]] have all the hallmarks of a moral panic. They further argue that this moral panic shares much in common with the '[[Human trafficking|white slavery]]' panic of a century earlier as prompted passage of the 1910 [[Mann Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12147-999-0021-9 |pmid=12296110 |title=Loose women or lost women?

=== 2016âpresent: suicide communities ===
The so-called "[[Blue Whale (game)|Blue Whale]]" hypothetical communities encouraging minors to commit suicide in alternative reality game form. As with many other moral panics, this one may have been started with an article in a newspaper. Some people consider it as a hoax with the objective to increase approval to [[Internet censorship]] in societies. Some governments have taken legislative actions strengthening internet censorship and introducing new [[felony|felonies]] in the wake of the panic.

==Criticism==
Paul Joosse (2017) has argued that while classic moral panic theory styled itself as being part of the 'sceptical revolution' that sought to critique structural functionalism, it is actually very similar to [[Ãmile Durkheim|Durkheim]]'s depiction of how the collective conscience is strengthened through its reactions to deviance (in Cohen's case, for example, 'right-thinkers' use folk devils to strengthen societal orthodoxies). In his analysis of [[Donald Trump]]'s 2016 electoral victory, Joosse reimagines moral panic in [[Max Weber|Weberian]] terms, showing how charismatic moral entrepreneurs can at once deride folk devils in the traditional sense while avoiding the conservative moral recapitulation that classic moral panic theory predicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bjc/azx047 |title=Expanding Moral Panic Theory to Include the Agency of Charismatic Entrepreneurs |journal=British Journal of Criminology |last1=Joosse |first1=Paul |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism is that of disproportionality. The problem with this argument is that there is no way to measure what a proportionate reaction should be to a specific action.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;{{rp|xxviâxxxi}} Jarrett Thibodeaux (2014) further argues that the criteria of disproportionality erroneously assumes that a social problem ''should'' correspond with some objective criteria of harm. The idea that a social problem should correspond with some objective criteria of harm, but is a moral panic when it does not, is a 'constructionism of the gaps' line of explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0038038513511560 |title=Three Versions of Constructionism and their Reliance on Social Conditions in Social Problems Research |journal=Sociology |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=829 |year=2014 |last1=Thibodeaux |first1=J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1995 about the moral panic that arose in the UK after a series of murders by juveniles, chiefly that of two-year-old [[Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger]] by two ten-year-old boys but also including that of 70-year-old [[Murder of Edna Phillips|Edna Phillips]] by two 17-year-old girls, the sociologist [[Colin Hay (political scientist)|Colin Hay]] pointed out that the folk devil was ambiguous in such cases; the child perpetrators would normally be thought of as innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Colin |last=Hay |authorlink=Colin Hay (political scientist) |title=Mobilization Through Interpellation: James Bulger, Juvenile Crime and the Construction of a Moral Panic |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/096466399500400203 |journal=Social &amp; Legal Studies |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=197â223 |year=1995 |doi=10.1177/096466399500400203 }} Cited in {{cite book |first=Alan |last=Hunt |contribution=Fractious Rivals?

In "Rethinking 'moral panic' for multi-mediated social worlds", [[Angela McRobbie]] and [[Sarah Thornton]] argue "that it is now time that every stage in the process of constructing a moral panic, as well as the social relations which support it, should be revised." Their argument is that mass media has changed since the concept of moral panic emerged so "that 'folk devils' are less marginalized than they once were", and that 'folk devils' are not only castigated by mass media but supported and defended by it as well. They also suggest that the "points of social control" that moral panics used to rest on "have undergone some degree of shift, if not transformation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/591571 |jstor=591571 |title=Rethinking 'Moral Panic' for Multi-Mediated Social Worlds |journal=The British Journal of Sociology |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=559 |year=1995 |last1=McRobbie |first1=Angela |last2=Thornton |first2=Sarah L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British criminologist Yvonne Jewkes has also raised issue with the term 'morality', how it is accepted unproblematically in the concept of 'moral panic' and how most research into moral panics fails to approach the term critically but instead accepts it at face value.&lt;ref name = Jewkes1&gt;{{citation | last = Jewkes | first = Yvonne | contribution = Media and moral panics | editor-last = Jewkes | editor-first = Yvonne | title = Media &amp; Crime | publisher = SAGE | pages = 76â77 | location = London &amp; Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2011 | origyear = 2004 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781848607033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewkes goes on to argue that the thesis and the way it has been used fails to distinguish between crimes that quite rightly offend human morality, and thus elicit a justifiable reaction, and those that demonise minorities. The public are not sufficiently gullible to keep accepting the latter and allowing themselves to be manipulated by the media and the government.&lt;ref name="Jewkes1"/&gt;

Another British criminologist, Steve Hall, goes a step further to suggest that the term 'moral panic' is a fundamental category error. Hall argues that although some crimes are sensationalized by the media, in the general structure of the crime/control narrative the ability of the existing state and criminal justice system to protect the public is also overstated. Public concern is whipped up only for the purpose of being soothed, which produces not panic but the opposite, comfort and complacency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall |first=S. |year=2012 |title=Theorizing Crime and Deviance: A New Perspective |location=London |publisher=Sage |pages=132â139 |isbn=9781848606722 |url=https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/theorizing-crime-and-deviance/book233792#description}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Echoing another point Hall makes, the sociologists Thompson and Williams argue that the concept of 'moral panic' is not a rational response to the phenomenon of social reaction, but itself a product of the irrational middle-class fear of the imagined working-class 'mob'. Using as an example a peaceful and lawful protest staged by local mothers against the re-housing of sex-offenders on their estate, Thompson and Williams show how the sensationalist demonization of the protesters by moral panic theorists and the liberal press was just as irrational as the demonization of the sex offenders by the protesters and the tabloid press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=W. |last2=Williams |first2=A. |year=2013 |title=The Myth of Moral Panics: Sex, Snuff, and Satan |series=Routledge Advances in Criminology |location=London |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415812665 }} {{page needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many sociologists and criminologists (Ungar, Hier, Rohloff) have revised Cohen's original framework. The revisions are compatible with the way in which Cohen theorizes panics in the third ''Introduction to Folk Devils and Moral Panics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-4446.2011.01377.x |pmid=21899526 |title=Tightening the focus: Moral panic, moral regulation and liberal government |journal=The British Journal of Sociology |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=523â41 |year=2011 |last1=Hier |first1=Sean P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The term was used in 1830, in a way that completely differs from its modern [[social science]] application, by a religious magazine&lt;ref name=HB&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Dr. Cox on regeneration | journal = [[Millennial Harbinger]] | volume = 1 | pages = 546â550 | publisher = W.

To paralyze the soul, or to strike it through with a moral panic is not regeneration." (page 546) and "After quoting such scriptures as these, "''Seek'' and you shall find," "''Come'' unto me, and I will give you rest," they ask,  ...is it not the natural language of these expressions that the mind is as far as possible from stagnation, or torpor, or "moral panic?

{{nihongo|'''On Kawara'''|æ²³å æ¸©|Kawara On|December 24, 1932 â July 10, 2014}} was a [[Japan]]ese [[conceptual art]]ist who lived in [[New York City]] from 1965. He took part in many solo and group [[Art exhibition|exhibitions]], including the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1976.

==Early life==
Kawara was born in Kariya, Japan on December 24, 1932. After graduating from Kariya High School in 1951, Kawara moved to [[Tokyo]]. Kawara went to Mexico in 1959, where his father was the director of an engineering company. He stayed three years, painting, attending art school and exploring the country.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[[Roberta Smith]] (July 15, 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/arts/design/on-kawara-conceptual-artist-who-found-elegance-in-every-day-dies-at-81.html On Kawara, Artist Who Found Elegance in Every Day, Dies at 81] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1962 to 1964 he moved back and forth between New York and Paris.&lt;ref name="February 5, 2015"&gt;[[Roberta Smith]] (February 5, 2015), [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/06/arts/design/the-guggenheim-shows-first-on-kawara-retrospective.html A Life Captivated by the Wonder of Time: The Guggenheim Shows First On Kawara Retrospective] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled through Europe before settling in 1965 in [[New York City]], where he was an intermittent resident until his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=3030 On Kawara] MoMA Collection. Source: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Kawara belonged to a broadly international generation of [[Conceptual art]]ists that began to emerge in the mid-1960s, stripping art of personal emotion, reducing it to nearly pure information or idea and greatly playing down the art object. Along with [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Hanne Darboven]] and others, Kawara gave special prominence to language.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

===''Paris-New York Drawings''===
From 1962 to 1964 Kawara made about 200 ''Paris-New York Drawings''. Their motifs include stripes and grids like those of the Minimalist painter [[Agnes Martin]].&lt;ref name="February 5, 2015"/&gt; Other drawings depict installation pieces that fill rooms with networks of string.&lt;ref name="February 5, 2015"/&gt;

===''Today'' series===
[[File:Oct 31, 1973 (Today Series, "Tuesday") On Kawara.JPG|thumb|''Today'' Series date painting at [[Art Institute of Chicago]].]]
From January 4, 1966,&lt;ref name="February 5, 2015"/&gt; Kawara made a long series of "[[calendar date|Date]] paintings" (the ''Today'' series), which consist entirely of the date on which the painting was executed in simple white lettering set against a solid background. The date is always documented in the language and grammatical conventions of the country in which the painting is executed (i.e., â26. ÃG. 1995,â from [[Reykjavik]], Iceland, or â13 JUIN 2006,â from [[Monte Carlo]]);&lt;ref&gt;Karen Rosenberg (February 2, 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/03/arts/design/on-kawaras-date-painting-s-at-david-zwirner-gallery.html On Kawaraâs âDate Painting(s)â at David Zwirner Gallery] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Esperanto is used when the first language of a given country does not use the Roman alphabet.&lt;ref name="zwirner"&gt;[http://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibitions-2/current-exhibitions/ On Kawara: Date Painting(s) in New York and 136 Other Cities, January 6 â February 11, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202122107/http://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibitions-2/current-exhibitions/ |date=February 2, 2012 }} [[David Zwirner Gallery]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings, executed in [[Liquitex]] on canvas, conform to one of eight standard sizes, ranging from 8x10 inches to 61x89 inches,&lt;ref name="On Kawara, May 1, 1987 1987"&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/on-kawara-may-1-1987-4913736-details.aspx?pos=3&amp;intObjectID=4913736&amp;sid=&amp;page=4 On Kawara, ''May 1, 1987'' (1987)] [[Christie's]] Post-War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale, 16 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; all horizontal in orientation. The exceptions are the three paintings, roughly five by seven feet, executed on July 16, 20 and 21, 1969 â three days when the world was riveted by the [[Apollo 11|moon landing]].&lt;ref name="February 5, 2015"/&gt;

The dates on the paintings, hand-painted with calculated precision,&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrian Searle]] (December 3, 2002), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/dec/03/art.artsfeatures It's a date!] ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; are always centered on the canvas and painted white, whereas the background colors vary; the paintings from the early years tend to have bold colors, and the more recent ones tend to be darker in tone. For example, Kawara briefly used red for several months in 1967 and then returned to darker hues until 1977. Four coats of paint are carefully applied for the ground and each allowed enough time to dry before being rubbed down in preparation for subsequent coats.&lt;ref name="On Kawara, May 1, 1987 1987"/&gt; Eschewing stencils in favor of hand-drawn characters, Kawara skillfully renders the script, initially a [[sans-serif]], elongated version of [[Gill Sans]], later a quintessentially modernist [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gms.be/index.php?content=artist_detail&amp;id_artist=30 On Kawara] Galerie Micheline Szwajcer, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Each work is carefully executed by hand. Some days he made more than one.&lt;ref name="diacenter"&gt;[http://www.diacenter.org/exhibitions/artistbio/86 On Kawara - Artist Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927044942/http://www.diacenter.org/exhibitions/artistbio/86 |date=2011-09-27 }} Dia Art Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; When Kawara was unable to complete the painting on the day it was started he immediately destroyed it.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; When a ''Date Painting'' is not exhibited, it is placed in a cardboard box custom-made for the painting, which is lined with a clipping from a local newspaper from the city in which the artist made the painting; most clippings are from ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="February 5, 2015"/&gt; Although the boxes are part of the work, they are rarely exhibited. Each year between 63 and 241 paintings were made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidzwirner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/press-release-1999.pdf On Kawara: I Read 1966-1995, March 20 - April 17, 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301025018/http://www.davidzwirner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/press-release-1999.pdf |date=March 1, 2014 }} [[David Zwirner Gallery]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each ''Date Painting'' is registered in a journal and marked on a ''One Hundred Years Calendar''. When Kawara finished a painting, he applied a swatch of the paint mixture he used to a small rectangle that was then glued onto a chart in the journal. Under each colour is a number showing the painting's sequence in that year and a letter indicating its size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/liverpool/exhibitions/colourchart/artists/kawara.shtm On Kawara] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107004315/http://www.tate.org.uk/liverpool/exhibitions/colourchart/artists/kawara.shtm |date=2011-01-07 }} Tate Liverpool, ''Colour Chart: Reinventing Colour, 1950 to Today'', 29 May â 13 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The 48 journals&lt;ref name="February 5, 2015"/&gt; therefore record the details of the paintingâs size, color and newspaper headline, while the calendar uses colored dots to indicate the days in which a painting was made, and to record the number of days since the artistâs birth. Kawara created nearly 3,000 date paintings&lt;ref name="wsj.com"&gt;Marc Myers (January 30, 2015), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-guggenheim-show-silence-spans-on-kawaras-career-1422655735 The Guggenheim Show âSilenceâ Spans Kawaraâs Career] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; in more than 112 cities worldwide in a project that was planned to end only with his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speronewestwater.com/exhibitions/sculpting-time/installations Sculpting Time] Sperone Westwater, 25 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Title'' and postcards===
Much like the ''Today'' series, Kawara uses the number of days followed by the date the work was executed as his life-dates. So the piece entitled ''[https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.134202.html Title]'' at the [[National Gallery of Art]] has Kawara's life-dates as 26,697 (January 27, 2006) which, when calculated, place Kawara's birthdate at December 24, 1932. Other series of works include the ''I Went and I Met'' series of [[postcard]]s sent to his friends detailing aspects of his life, and a series of telegrams sent to various people bearing the message "I AM STILL ALIVE". Between 1968 and 1979, On Kawara created his information series, ''I Got Up'', in which he sent two picture postcards from his location on that morning. All of the 1,500&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt; cards list the artist's time of getting up, the date, the place of residence and the name and address of the receiver another series of postcards, ''I Got Up At'', rubber-stamped with the time he got up that morning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=2031746 On Kawara (b. 1932), I Got Up, Sale 8523] Christie's New York, 15 May 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The length of each correspondence ranged from a single card to hundreds sent consecutively over a period of months; the gesture's repetitive nature is counterbalanced by the artist's peripatetic global wanderings and exceedingly irregular hours (in 1973 alone he sent postcards from twenty-eight cities).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2001.228a-pp ''I GOT UP, 1970'' by On Kawara] [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''One Million Years''===
[[File:One million years.jpg|thumb|right|180px|One million years]]''One Million Years'' is one of the artistâs best-known works about the passage and marking of time. It lists each year for the one million-year period leading up to the artwork's conception and the million years that follow it. It is sometimes performed, during which pairs of performers (typically one male and one female for an each segment) read dates from each list in order, simultaneously performing ''One Million Years [Past]'' and ''One Million Years [Future]''.

The artwork was first made in 1969, the year of the Woodstock music festival, major civil protests against the Vietnam War and man's first landing on the moon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southlondongallery.org/page/144/On+Kawara+Reading+One+Million+Years/132 Reading One Million Years, 29 March - 5 April 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714212719/http://www.southlondongallery.org/page/144/On+Kawara+Reading+One+Million+Years/132 |date=14 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first audio presentation of the reading of ''One Million Years'' occurred in 1993 during Kawaraâs yearlong solo exhibition âOne Thousand Days One Million Yearsâ at [[Dia Art Foundation|Dia Center for the Arts]] in New York. Visitors could hear ''One Million Years [Future]'' being read, while viewing ''One Million Years [Past]'' and a group of date paintings. The longest public reading from ''One Million Years'' took place at ''[[documenta]]'' 11 in 2002, where male and female participants sat side by side in a glass enclosure taking turns reading dates for the duration of the 100-day exhibition, switching between ''[Past]'' and ''[Future]''. In 2004, the project traveled to [[Trafalgar Square]] in London for a continuous outdoor reading lasting 7 days and 7 nights. Since then, readings and recordings have taken place in cities around the world.

===One-Hundred-Year Calendars===
For his one-hundred-year calendars, Kawara, starting with the date of his birth, systematically marks each day of his life with a yellow dot on the calendars, and registers a completed date painting with a green dot (red dots signify that more than one painting was completed on that given day).&lt;ref name="zwirner"/&gt;

===''Pure Consciousness''===
In ''Pure Consciousness,'' a traveling exhibition initiated in 1998, Kawara lent seven ''Date paintings'' (January 1 to January 7, 1997) to kindergartens and schools in Madagascar, Australia, Bhutan, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Colombia, Turkey, Japan, Finland, Iceland, Israel, and the United States. At all schools they hang in classrooms, bearing dates that fall within the lifespans of the children.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Searle (3 December 2002), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/dec/03/art.artsfeatures It's a date!] ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Kawara's first exhibitions include the first Nippon Exhibition, at the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum, in 1953, and at the Takemiya and Hibiya galleries the following year.&lt;ref name="diacenter"/&gt; His work was exhibited at New York's Dwan Gallery in 1967, and his one-person exhibition "One Million Years" was shown in DÃ¼sseldorf, Paris, and Milan in 1971. Kawara's work was included in ''[[documenta]]'' 5 (1972), 7 (1982), and 11 (2002), in Kassel, and in the Tokyo Biennale (1970), the Kyoto Biennale (1976), and the [[Venice Biennale]] (1976).

His work has been included in many conceptual art surveys from the seminal ''Information'' show at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York in 1970 to ''Reconsidering the Object of Art: 1965-1975'' at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]] in 1995. Solo exhibitions of his work have included the [[Otis Art Institute]], Los Angeles, and the [[Centre Pompidou]], Paris, in 1977; ''Continuity/Discontinuity'' at the [[Moderna Museet]], Stockholm in 1980; [[Museum Boymans-van Beuningen]], Rotterdam in 1991; the Dia Center for the Arts, New York in 1993; and the [[Dallas Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120802115923/http://www.dm-art.org/PressRoom/Archives/dma_205667 Dallas Museum of Art to Present ''On Kawara: 10 Tableaux and 16,952 Pages'', May 18 - August 24, 2008] Dallas Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kawara's first comprehensive retrospective, [http://exhibitions.guggenheim.org/onkawara/ âOn KawaraâSilenceâ] at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], was installed in 12 sections according to a plan devised by himself. Two years before his death, the artist offered the exhibitâs curator Jeffrey Weiss a list of oblique titlesâincluding â48 Years,â âSelf-Observationâ and âMonologueââfor each of the sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On Kawara-Silence|url=http://exhibitions.guggenheim.org/onkawara/|website=guggenheim.org|publisher=Â© 2015 The Solomon R.

==Death==
He died in New York&lt;ref name="tagesspiegel.de"&gt;http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/on-kawara-gestorben-der-mann-der-die-zeit-zaehlte/10186744.html&lt;/ref&gt; on July 10, 2014 at the age of 81.&lt;ref&gt;http://fr.phaidon.com/agenda/art/articles/2014/july/14/on-kawaras-date-paintings-explained/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/arts/design/on-kawara-conceptual-artist-who-found-elegance-in-every-day-dies-at-81.html?_r=0/&lt;/ref&gt; Kawara's published obituaries state that he was alive for 29,771 days&lt;ref&gt;http://www.art-annual.jp/column-essay/essay/39580/&lt;/ref&gt; rather than giving dates of birth and death. Kawara's â³100 Years Calendarâ³ indicates that he was born on December 24, 1932, not on the 2nd of January 1933, as was officially recorded.&lt;ref&gt;On Kawara - Silence, by Jeffrey Weiss and Anne Wheeler, 2015, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt; This would make the date of his death, June 27, 2014.

The People's Uprising rally or '''Himpunan Kebangkitan Rakyat''' ([[Malay language|Malay]]) was a rally that was held in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]] on 12 January 2013.  The rally was held by various Malaysian opposition friendly non-governmental organisations and opposition parties in opposition to many of the government policies and decisions that have been claimed by left wing supporters to be unfair and affecting the Malaysian populace.  The main venue which the organisers have chosen for the rally is [[Stadium Merdeka]]. The event was also known as the '''KL 112 rally''', where the numbers indicate the date of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2013/1/14/nation/12571834&amp;sec=nation|title=Kudos to cops and KL112 rally|date=14 January 2013|work=The Star (Malaysia)|accessdate=14 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116061009/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2013%2F1%2F14%2Fnation%2F12571834&amp;sec=nation|archivedate=16 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/218831|title=The winners and losers in KL112 - Malaysiakini|date=13 January 2013|work=[[Malaysiakini]]|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
According to social activist and icon Hishamuddin Rais, the grievances against the government are many and varied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Malaysia |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/litee/malaysia/article/january-rally-to-go-on-even-without-permit-says-activist |title=January rally to go on even without permit, says activist |publisher=The Malaysian Insider |date= |accessdate=17 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130216214724/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/litee/malaysia/article/january-rally-to-go-on-even-without-permit-says-activist |archivedate=16 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following lists of grouses:

The opposition coalition [[Pakatan Rakyat]] has made a 10-point declaration:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=To |first=Queville |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2013/01/12/pakatan-makes-10-point-demand/ |title=Pakatan makes 10-point demand |publisher=Free Malaysia Today |date=12 January 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundaily.my/news/587074 ]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lead up to the rally ==

=== Government and police measures ===
The police have advised the organisers of the rally to hold the rally in [[National Stadium, Bukit Jalil|Bukit Jalil stadium]] instead of having it in Stadium Merdeka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/218623 |title=Malaysiakini |publisher=Malaysiakini |date=10 January 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In anticipation of the protests the government began the closure of Dataran Merdeka to prevent protesters from gathering at that location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=To |first=Queville |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2013/01/11/dataran-closed-ahead-of-rally/ |title=Dataran closed ahead of rally, no FRU deployment |publisher=Free Malaysia Today |date=11 January 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government has also warned against civil servants from attending the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Malaysia |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/civil-servants-advised-against-joining-the-rally-tomorrow/ |title=Civil servants advised against joining the rally tomorrow |publisher=The Malaysian Insider |date= |accessdate=17 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023061410/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/civil-servants-advised-against-joining-the-rally-tomorrow/ |archivedate=23 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various public universities in Malaysia echoed the government's warning telling students and teachers not to attend the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/218670 |title=Malaysiakini |publisher=Malaysiakini |date=11 January 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/218699 |title=Malaysiakini |publisher=Malaysiakini |date=11 January 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government-controlled mainstream media gave scant coverage on the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/218681 |title=Malaysiakini |publisher=Malaysiakini |date=11 January 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9763">Classical ''Newtonian'' physics has, formally, been replaced by [[quantum mechanics]] on the small scale and [[Theory of relativity|relativity]] on the large scale. Because most humans continue to think in terms of the kind of events we perceive in the human scale of daily life, it became necessary to provide a new '''philosophical interpretation of classical physics'''. Classical mechanics worked extremely well within its domain of observation but made inaccurate predictions at very small scale - atomic scale systems - and when objects moved very fast or were very massive. Viewed through the lens of quantum mechanics or relativity, we can now see that classical physics, imported from the world of our everyday experience, includes notions for which there is no actual evidence. For example, one commonly held idea is that there exists one absolute time shared by all observers. Another is the idea that electrons are discrete entities like miniature planets that circle the nucleus in definite orbits{{ref|Messiah_45_50}}.

The [[correspondence principle]] says that classical accounts are approximations to quantum mechanics that are for all practical purposes equivalent to quantum mechanics when dealing with macro-scale events.

Various problems occur if classical mechanics is used to describe quantum systems, such as the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]] in [[black body radiation]], the [[Gibbs paradox]], and the lack of a zero point for [[entropy]].

Since classical physics corresponds more closely to ordinary language than modern physics does, this subject is also a part of the philosophical interpretation of [[Philosophy of language|ordinary language]], which has other aspects, as well.

== The measurement process ==
In classical mechanics it is assumed that given properties - speed or mass of a particle; temperature of a gas, etc. - can in principle be measured to any degree of accuracy desired.

Study of the problem of [[measurement in quantum mechanics]] has shown that measurement of any object involves interactions between the measuring apparatus and that object that inevitably affect it in some way; at the scale of particles this effect is necessarily large. On the everyday macroscopic scale the effect can be made small.

Furthermore, the classical idealization of a property simply being "measured" ignores the fact that measurement of a property - temperature of a gas by thermometer, say - involves a pre-existing account of the behavior of the measuring device. When effort was devoted to working out the [[operational definition]]s involved in precisely determining position and momentum of micro-scale entities, physicists were required perforce to provide such an account for measuring devices to be used at that scale. The key thought experiment in this regard is known as [[Heisenberg's microscope]].

The problem for the individual is how to properly characterize a part of reality of which one has no direct [[empirical evidence|sense experience]]. Our inquiries into the quantum domain find most pertinent whatever it is that happens in between the events by means of which we obtain our only information. Our accounts of the quantum domain are based on interactions of macro domain instruments and sense organs with physical events, and those interactions give us some but not all of the information we seek. We then seek to derive further information from series of those experiments in an indirect way. 

One interpretation of this conundrum is given by [[Werner Heisenberg]] in his 1958 book, ''Physics and Philosophy,''p.&amp;nbsp;144f:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We can say that physics is a part of science and as such aims at a description and understanding of nature. Any kind of understanding, scientific or not, depends on our language, on the communication of ideas. Every description of phenomena, of experiments and their results, rests upon language as the only means of communication. The words of this language represent the concepts of daily life, which in the scientific language of physics may be refined to the concepts of classical physics.  These concepts are the only tools for an unambiguous communication about events, about the setting up of experiments, and about their results. If therefore the atomic physicist is asked to give a description of what really happens in his experiments, the words "description" and "really" and "happens" can only refer to the concepts of daily life or of classical physics. As soon as the physicist gave up this basis he would lose the means of unambiguous communication and could not continue in his science. Therefore, any statement about what has "actually happened" is a statement in terms of the classical concepts and -- because of thermodynamics and of the uncertainty relations -- by its very nature incomplete with respect to the details of the atomic events involved. The demand to "describe what happens" in the quantum-theoretical process between two successive observations is a contradiction ''in adjecto,'' since the word "describe" refers to the use of the classical concepts, while these concepts cannot be applied in the space between the observations; they can only be applied at the points of observation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Primacy of observation in quantum mechanics and special relativity ==
Both quantum mechanics and special relativity begin their divergence from classical mechanics by insisting on the primacy of observations and a refusal to admit unobservable entities. Thus special relativity rejects the absolute simultaneity assumed by classical mechanics; and quantum mechanics  does not permit one to speak of properties of the system (exact position, say) other than those that can be connected to macro scale observations. Position and momentum are not things waiting for us to discover; rather, they are the results that are obtained by performing certain procedures.

''This article will use the [[Einstein summation convention]].''

The theory of [[general relativity]] required the adaptation of existing theories of physical, electromagnetic, and quantum effects to account for non-Euclidean geometries. These '''physical theories modified by general relativity''' are described below.

==Classical mechanics and special relativity==
Classical mechanics and special relativity are lumped together here because special relativity is in many ways intermediate between general relativity and classical mechanics, and shares many attributes with classical mechanics.

In the following discussion, the [[mathematics of general relativity]] is used heavily. Also, under the [[principle of minimal coupling]], the physical equations of special relativity can be turned into their general relativity counterparts by replacing the Minkowski metric (''Î·&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;'') with the relevant metric of spacetime (''g&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;'') and by replacing any partial derivatives with covariant derivatives. In the discussions that follow, the change of metrics is implied.

===Inertia===
Inertial motion is motion free of all [[force]]s. In Newtonian mechanics, the force ''F'' acting on a particle with mass ''m'' is given by [[Newton's second law]], &lt;math&gt;F=m \ddot{r}&lt;/math&gt;, where the acceleration is given by the second derivative of position ''r'' with respect to time ''t'' . Zero force means that inertial motion is just motion with zero acceleration:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 r}{\mathrm{d}t^2}=0&lt;/math&gt;

The idea is the same in special relativity. Using [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]], inertial motion is described mathematically as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 x^a}{\mathrm{d}\tau^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the position coordinate and ''Ï'' is [[proper time]]. (In Newtonian mechanics, ''Ï â¡ t'', the coordinate time).

In both Newtonian mechanics and special relativity, space and then spacetime are assumed to be flat, and we can construct a global Cartesian coordinate system. In general relativity, these restrictions on the shape of spacetime and on the coordinate system to be used are lost. Therefore, a different definition of inertial motion is required. In relativity, inertial motion occurs along timelike or null [[geodesic]]s as parameterized by proper time. This is expressed mathematically by the [[geodesic equation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 x^a}{\mathrm{d}\tau^2} + \Gamma^a_{bc} \, \frac{\mathrm{d} x^b}{\mathrm{d}\tau} \,\frac{\mathrm{d} x^c}{\mathrm{d}\tau} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^a_{bc}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Christoffel symbol]]. Since general relativity describes four-dimensional spacetime, this represents four equations, with each one describing the second derivative of a coordinate with respect to proper time. In the case of flat space in Cartesian coordinates, we have &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^a_{bc}=0&lt;/math&gt;, so this equation reduces to the special relativity form.

===Gravitation===
For gravitation, the relationship between Newton's theory of [[gravity]] and general relativity is governed by the [[correspondence principle]]: General relativity must produce the same results as gravity does for the cases where Newtonian physics has been shown to be accurate.

Around a spherically symmetric object, the Newtonian theory of gravity predicts that objects will be physically accelerated towards the center on the object by the rule

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\ddot r} = GM \mathbf{\hat{r}}/r^2&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' is Newton's [[Gravitational constant]], ''M'' is the mass of the gravitating object, ''r'' is the distance to the gravitation object, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector identifying the direction to the massive object.

In the [[weak-field approximation]] of general relativity, an identical coordinate acceleration must exist. For the Schwarzschild solution (which is the simplest possible spacetime surrounding a massive object), the same acceleration as that which (in Newtonian physics) is created by gravity is obtained when a constant of integration is set equal to ''2MG/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''). For more information, see [[Deriving the Schwarzschild solution]].

===Transition from Newtonian mechanics to general relativity===
{{main|Newtonian foundation of general relativity}}

Some of the basic concepts of general relativity can be outlined outside the [[Special relativity|relativistic]] domain. In particular, the idea that mass/energy generates [[curvature]] in [[Spacetime|space]] and that curvature affects the motion of masses can be illustrated in a [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian]] setting.

General relativity generalizes the [[geodesic equation]] and the [[Einstein field equation|field equation]] to the relativistic realm in which trajectories in space are replaced with [[FermiâWalker transport]] along [[world line]]s in [[spacetime]]. The equations are also generalized to more complicated curvatures.

===Transition from special relativity to general relativity===
{{main|Theoretical motivation for general relativity}}

The basic structure of general relativity, including the [[geodesic equation]] and [[Einstein field equation]], can be obtained from [[special relativity]] by examining the [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]] and [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of a particle in a [[circular orbit]] about the earth. In terms of [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]], the transition involves replacing [[global Lorentz covariance]] with [[local Lorentz covariance]].

===Conservation of energyâmomentum===
In classical mechanics, conservation laws for energy and momentum are handled separately in the two principles of [[conservation of energy]] and [[Momentum#Conservation|conservation of momentum]]. With the advent of [[special relativity]], these two conservation principles were united through the concept of [[mass-energy equivalence]].

Mathematically, the general relativity statement of energyâmomentum conservation is:

:&lt;math&gt;{T_a}^b{}_{; b} = {T_a}^b{}_{,b} + {\Gamma^b}_{cb} \, {T_a}^c - {\Gamma^c}_{ab} \, {T_c}^b = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{T_a}^b&lt;/math&gt; is the [[stressâenergy tensor]], the comma indicates a partial derivative and the semicolon indicates a [[covariant derivative]]. The terms involving the Christoffel symbols are absent in the special relativity statement of energyâmomentum conservation.

Unlike classical mechanics and special relativity, it is not usually possible to unambiguously define the total energy and momentum in general relativity, so the tensorial conservation laws are ''local'' statements only (see [[ADM energy]], though). This often causes confusion in time-dependent spacetimes which apparently do not conserve energy, although the local law is always satisfied. Exact formulation of energyâmomentum conservation on an arbitrary geometry requires use of a non-unique [[stress-energyâmomentum pseudotensor]].

==Electromagnetism==
{{main|Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime}}

General relativity modifies the description of [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic phenomena]] by employing a new version of [[Maxwell's equations]]. These differ from the [[Formulation of Maxwell's equations in special relativity|special relativity form]] in that the Christoffel symbols make their presence in the equations via the covariant derivative.

The source equations of [[Classical electromagnetism|electrodynamics]] in curved spacetime are (in [[cgs units]])

:&lt;math&gt; F^{\,ab}{}_{;b} = {4\pi \over c }\,J^{\,a}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the [[electromagnetic field tensor]] representing the electromagnetic field and ''J&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;'' is a [[four-current]] representing the sources of the electromagnetic field.

The source-free equations are the same as their special relativity counterparts.

The effect of an [[electromagnetic field]] on a charged object is then modified to
:&lt;math&gt; P^{\, a} {}_{\, ;\tau} = (q/m)\,F^{\,ab}P_b&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''q'' is the charge on the object, ''m'' is the rest mass of the object and ''P&lt;sup&gt; a&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the [[four-momentum]] of the charged object. Maxwell's equations in flat spacetime are recovered in rectangular coordinates by reverting the covariant derivatives to partial derivatives. For Maxwell's equations in flat spacetime in curvilinear coordinates see [http://www.uic.edu/classes/eecs/eecs520/textbook/node2.html]
or [http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/MaxwellEquations.html]

[[Avant-garde]] art and American pop culture have had an intriguing relationship from the time of the art form's inception in America to the current day. The art form, which began in the early half of the nineteenth century in [[Europe]],&lt;ref name = ABC&gt;{{Cite book|author=Crane, Diana|title=The Transformation of the Avant Garde: the New York Art World|publisher=University of Chicago|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; started to rise slowly in [[United States|America]] under the guise of [[Dadaism]] in 1915. While originally formed under a group of artists in [[New York City]] who wanted to counter [[popular culture|pop culture]] with their art, music, and literature the art form began to grow into prominence with American pop culture due to a variety of factors between the 1940s to the 1970s. However, from many factors that arose in the late 1970s, avant-garde began to both lessen in prominence and began to blend with the pop culture to the point in which most art critics considered the art form extinct.

== Avant Garde and Kitsch ==
Though his first published essays dealt mainly with literature and theatre, art still held a powerful attraction for [[Clement Greenberg]], so in 1939, he made a sudden name as a visual art writer with possibly his most well-known and oft-quoted essay, "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]", first published in the journal ''[[Partisan Review]]''. In this Marxist-influenced essay, Greenberg claimed that true [[avant-garde]] art is a product of the Enlightenment's revolution of critical thinking, and as such resists and recoils from the degradation of culture in both mainstream capitalist and communist society, while acknowledging the paradox that, at the same time, the artist, dependent on the market or the state, remains inexorably attached ''"by an umbilical cord of gold"''. Kitsch, on the other hand, was the product of industrialization and the urbanization of the working class, a filler made for the consumption of the working class: a populace hungry for culture, but without the resources and education to enjoy cutting edge avant garde culture. Greenberg writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Kitsch, using for raw material the debased and academicized simulacra of genuine culture, welcomes and cultivates this insensibility. It is the source of its profits. Kitsch is mechanical and operates by formulas. Kitsch is vicarious experience and faked sensations. Kitsch changes according to style, but remains always the same. Kitsch is the epitome of all that is spurious in the life of our times. Kitsch pretends to demand nothing of its customers except their money â not even their time." &lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Clement. "Avant-Garde and Kitsch." [[Partisan Review]]. 6:5 (1939) 34â49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Greenberg, avant garde art was too "innocent" to be effectively used as propaganda or bent to a cause, while kitsch was ideal for stirring up false sentiment.

Greenberg appropriated the German word "[[kitsch]]" to describe this low, concocted form of "culture", though its [[connotation]]s have since been recast to a more affirmative acceptance of nostalgic materials of capitalist/communist culture. "Avant Garde and Kitsch" is clearly a politically motivated essay, in part a response to the destruction and repression of Modernist Art in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and represents a denouncement of the growing totalitarian threat in Europe and the "retrogression" of fascism.

==Further definition==
[[Avant-garde]], as sociologist Diana Crane states, âwas an art-form that had started in Europe that had started in the early nineteenth century.â While the art form has survived for this long, she states that the concept of the art form is âhighly ambiguousâ and it has been through many phases throughout its existence, including [[Dadaism]], [[Abstract Expressionism]], [[Minimalism]], and [[pop art]]. Socially, however, each form of avant-garde is united with the idea that it is part of the definition of high culture, although this in itself is defined in a variety of fashions.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

===Ways to determine avant-garde===
Due to the ambiguity of the term, Crane gives a few considerations on what could be considered avant-garde and what is not. She states that avant-garde can be determined in its approach to the [[aesthetic]], through the social content of the artwork, and through the production and distribution of the artwork.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

===Aesthetics===
Through aesthetic, a piece of artwork can be determined avant-garde if it does any of the following:
* '''If the artwork redefines artistic conventions.'''
* '''If it utilizes new artistic tools and techniques.'''
* '''And if it redefines the nature of the art objects.'''

An example of the aesthetic used in Avant-garde can include the artwork of [[Marcel Duchamp]]. For Duchamp's ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', he simply took a urinal and defined this as a ready-made art form. In this, he redefined artistic conventions by taking an item that was already made and employing the item for an artistic purpose. By doing this, he also employed a new technique in the production of art by taking something that was already produced and redefined the object he was using by taking a urinal and using it for art.

===Through Social Content===
Through social content, a piece of artwork can be determined avant-garde if it does one of the  following:
*; If the artwork incorporates in its artworks social or political values that are critical of or different from the majority culture.
:For example, in ''The Art of Humanism: Art in a Time of Change'', Barry Schwartz states that one of the roles of avant-garde art was to provide a counter-cultural force in the art world.
*; If it redefines the relationship between high and popular culture
:Like pop artists using images from advertisements and comic strips to employ a different meaning to those images
*; And if it adopts a critical attitude toward artistic institutions
:This is seen by the Dadaist attack on the legitimacy of art

===Through production and distribution===
Through its production and distribution, an artwork can be described as avant-garde if it redefines the social context for the production of art, in terms of critics, role models, and the audience; if it does one of the following:

*; The artwork redefines the organizational context for the production, display, and distribution of art
:A good example of this is the usage of alternative spaces in order to make the art appear unsellable.
*; The artwork redefines the nature of the artistic role or the extent to which the artist participates in other social institutions, which provides a good niche of avant-garde artists in the middle class.

===Differences with Post-Modernism===
While the two terms are used interchangeably today, some argue that the difference between the two lie in their approach to innovating art. According to Jochen Schulte-Sasse,&lt;ref name = BCD&gt;{{Cite book|author=BÃ¼ger, Peter|title=The Theory of the Avant-Garde|publisher=University of Minnesota|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; the two differ in the fact that [[Post-modernism]] wants to destroy old conceptions of art to replace them with new (without any reference to the social impact of the art). According to Diana Crane, post-modernists do this through a variety of ways, namely through creating effects of polysemy, ambiguity, and parody. Post-modernists also only focused on the technique of their art rather than the social impacts of their art. However, avant-garde wants to innovate art and also communicate social issues within it. It could also be defined that post-modernism uses their art with the intent to shock the person viewing the art while avant-garde, while it also often shocks the viewer, uses their art to communicate a message through the art while also using the art to shock the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Crane, Diana|title=Postmodernism and the Avant-Garde: Stylistic Change in Fashion Design|journal=Modernism/Modernity 4.3|year=1997}} pp.123-140&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subgenres of the avant-garde==
While avant-garde is a solitary art form, it has had a variety of subgenres attached to the art form throughout its history, with each communicating their own distinct messages. Some of them, like Dadaism and Pop Art, use the art to provide a social commentary.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; Others, like Abstract Expressionism, use outer-worldly figures and colors to evoke an emotional response.&lt;ref name = CDE&gt;Abstract Expressionism." EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. 2010. EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Online. 14 Nov. 2010 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1963/Abstract-Expressionism&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, there are some like Minimalism&lt;ref name = FGH&gt;"minimalism." EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. 2010. EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Online. 14 Nov. 2010 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; which use their art for the sake of making art without any emotional or social meanings behind them. While there are myriad different avant-garde subgenres that came about during its popularity in America, the four subgenres that played the biggest roles in American Popular Culture are Dadaism, Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, and Pop Art.

===Dadaism===
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|[[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''Fountain'' is an example of Dadaist [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|Ready-Mades]]]]
{{Main|Dada}}
Dadaism was the first major subgenre of avant-garde art to cross over into America. Dadaist artists, in many ways, wanted to contrast from the typical artist at the time from their idea of being against typical artistic conventions at the time and being anti-art. A good example of their anti-art approach came through what Dadaists call the âready-mades,â the most notable being [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s Fountain, which was a porcelain urinal. Ready-mades such as this caused great debate in the art community concerning the definition of art and how Dadaists should play in this definition.&lt;ref name = DEF&gt;âDadaâ EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. 2010. EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Online. 14 Nov. 2010 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/149499/Dada&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Commonalities Between Pieces====
While Dadaist pieces cannot be determined through a particular artistic form, many Dadaist artists collaborated in groups with each other in order to create their art, united on either to create art based on social issues (particularly in Europe) or to mock the art world in general (mostly in America). In America, the center of this movement came from two locations in the New York-area:  at Alfred Stieglitzâs New York gallery â291,â and at the studio of Walter Arensberg. In addition to group collaboration, artists of the Dada movement depended more on spontaneity and chance than following other established artists. They focused on rejecting the ideas formed by established artists and art creation and used methods such as collage, photomontage, and found-object construction to create their art. While this art form started strong in 1916 in Germany, it eventually faded out by 1922 in both Europe and America. However, despite its decline, Dada would play a major influence on other avant-garde and nihilistic art-forms in the future, including the Punk movement in the '1970s.&lt;ref name="DEF"/&gt;&lt;ref name = EFG&gt;{{Cite book|author=Marcus, Greil|title=Lipstick Traces: a Secret History of the Twentieth Century.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abstract Expressionism===
{{Main|Abstract Expressionism}}
Abstract Expressionism was another major avant-garde genre that, unlike Dadaism, was born in and popular in the United States. A number of artists that were practitioners of this art form include [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]], and [[Mark Rothko]]. Much like Dadaism in America, the center of the movement was in New York City.&lt;ref name="CDE"/&gt;

====Commonalities====
Also, much like Dadaism, although many of the artists worked together in creating their art, the art pieces cannot be determined through one particular art form. Pieces often varied differently between painting styles from both the techniques that were used in the piece and quality of expression of the pieces.  Despite the drastic differences between pieces, Abstract Expressionism shares several broad characteristics.  These characteristics includes:

* Each piece depicts forms that are not found in the visible world
* Each emphasize free, spontaneous, and personal emotional expressionism
* They exercise a freedom of technique with emphasis on exploitation of the physical character of the paint to evoke expressive qualities (violence, lyricism, etc.)
* They show similar emphasis on the unstudied and intuitive application of that paint in a form of psychic improvisation akin to the automatism of the Surrealists, with a similar intent of expressing the force of the creative unconscious in art.
* They display the abandonment of conventionally structured composition built up out of discrete and segregable elements and their replacement with a single unified, undifferentiated field, network, or other image that exists in unstructured space.
* Finally, the paintings fill large canvases to give these aforementioned visual effects both monumentality and engrossing power.

There are also three main techniques in which categorize Abstract Expressionism. First, there is [[Action Painting]], which is characterized by a loose, rapid, dynamic, or forceful handling of paint in sweeping or slashing brush strokes and in techniques partially dictated by chance, such as dripping or spilling the paint directly onto the canvas. Examples of this include Jackson Pollock dripping commercial paints on raw canvas to build up complex and tangled skeins of paint into exciting and suggestive linear patterns and Willem de Kooning used extremely vigorous and expressive brush strokes to build up richly colored and textured images. The second category of Abstract Expressionism is represented by a variety of styles ranging from [[Color field]], to [[Lyrical abstraction]]; delicate imagery and fluid shapes and fields of color included in works by [[Clyfford Still]], [[Philip Guston]], and [[Helen Frankenthaler]] to the more clearly structured, forceful, almost calligraphic pictures of [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Adolph Gottlieb]]. Finally, the last form of Abstract Expressionism is the third and least emotionally expressive approach was that of Rothko, [[Barnett Newman]], and [[Ad Reinhardt]]. These painters used large areas, or fields, of flat colour and thin, diaphanous paint to achieve quiet, subtle, almost meditative effects. While Abstract Expressionism's roots could be traced back as far as 1919, the peak of its popularity were in the 1950s to the 1960s.  This, like Dadaism before, shows another influential avant-grade artistic genre that suffered from a short peak of popularity.&lt;ref name="CDE"/&gt;

===Minimalism===
{{Main|Minimalism}}
Minimalism was an avant-grade genre from the 1910s to the late 1960s which was characterized by extreme simplicity of a form and a literal approach. Its origins could be stemmed from many artists, including Kandinsky, Picabia, Delaunay, Kupka, Survage and Malevich, who focused on reducing art to its basic element. A great example of his art was the painting of a black square on a white ground. Other minimalist artists that were famous at this time included painters such as Jack Youngerman, Ellsworth Kelly, Frank Stella, Kenneth Noland, Al Held, and Gene Davis  and sculptors such as  Donald Judd, Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Tony Smith, Anthony Caro, and Sol LeWitt.&lt;ref name="FGH"/&gt; [[File:Black Square.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kazimir Malevich]], Black Square, 1923, oil on canvas, State [[Russian Museum]], St.Petersburg]]

In many ways the rise of Minimalism came as a result of those who were dissatisfied with the Abstract Expressionist movement, primarily from the Action Paintings of the movement. The reason for many was that they believed that Action painting was too personal and insubstantial, and they adopted the point of view that a work of art should not refer to anything other than itself.&lt;ref name="FGH"/&gt;

====Similarities====
Unlike other genres of avant-garde at the time, minimalist art used not only a set of philosophical properties when it came to the production of their In order to rid their art of any extra-visual influence, Minimalist paintings used hard edge painting, a simplistic form, and a linear approach to emphasize two-dimensionality and to allow the viewer an immediate, purely visual response to art in comparison to any other sort of response.&lt;ref name="FGH"/&gt;

===Hard-Edge Painting===
{{Main|Hard-Edge Painting}}
Hard-edge painting is characterized by large, simplified, usually geometric forms on an overall flat surface; precise, razor-sharp contours; and broad areas of bright, unmodulated color that have been stained into unprimed canvas. It differs from other types of geometric abstraction in that it rejects both lyrical and mathematical composition because, even in this simplified field, they are a means of personal expression for the artist. Minimal hard-edge painting is the anonymous construction of a simple object. (Make a reference to the part of the encyclopedia entry that this came from)&lt;ref name="FGH"/&gt;

====Similarities between Minimalist Sculpture====
Much like minimalist painting, minimalist sculpture used extremely simple, monumental geometric forms made of fiberglass, plastic, sheet metal, or aluminum, either left raw or solidly painted with bright industrial color in order to convey the art for the usage of the visual response without allowing the art to create responses elsewhere. An example of Minimalist Sculpture is âFree Rideâ by Tony Smith, which is a black geometrical structure the size of a door opening on a white background.&lt;ref name="FGH"/&gt;

===Pop Art===
{{Main|Pop Art}}

One of the last major avant-garde artforms that proved to be very influential to the American pop culture was Pop Art. This art form had much of its roots in Great Britain in the early 1950s, but made its way into the American culture by the late 1950s and remained a popular art form in America from the 1960s. Some of the famous practitioners of this era include Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and Claes Oldenburg.&lt;ref name = GHI&gt;"Pop art." EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. 2010. EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Online. 14 Nov. 2010 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469967/Pop-art&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Similarities====
Pop art, also like minimalism, has clear commonalities between their pieces. Primarily, each piece uses commonplace items (comic strips, soup cans, road signs, and hamburgers) as the subject matter of their pieces. They emphatically present any iconography that has created a major impact on contemporary life without praise or condemnation but with overwhelming immediacy, and by means of the precise commercial techniques used by the media from which the iconography itself was borrowed. It was also an attempt to return to a more objective, universally acceptable form of art after the dominance in both the United States and Europe of the highly personal Abstract Expressionism. It was also iconoclastic, rejecting both the supremacy of the âhigh artâ of the past and the pretensions of other contemporary avant-garde art. Pop art became a cultural event because of its close reflection of a particular social situation and because its easily comprehensible images were immediately exploited by the mass media. Despite its opposition to other avant-garde art forms at its time, Pop art was a derivative of Dada, especially praising the art of  Marcel Duchamp, who with his âready-madesâ also praised many objects and imagery of American pop culture.&lt;ref name="GHI"/&gt;

==Relationship Before the 1940's==
Before World War II there were some significant artists and art movements in the United States, but, according to sociologist Diana Crane, these art movements never were directly inspired by art movements from Europe. However, due to the numbers of immigrants from Europe who were involved with the avant-garde movement in Europe, Dadaist artists from Europe like Marcel Duchamp moved to America carrying their avant-garde ideals with them. Once they arrived in New York City, many of these Dadaists decided to collaborate, making art to display to the public.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

Initially, while the Dadaists brought some attention to the New York art scene, they had very little attention outside of it. Some factors that played to the lack of attention of the Dadaists at the time included the lack of museums throughout the United States and the lack of funding to the artists who created and advertised the art.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

===Origins of European avant-garde===
According to Peter Burger, some of the theories involving aesthetics can come all the way back to the writings of Karl Marx. According to Burger, â For Marx, this development is not merely one in economic theory. Rather, he feels that the possibility of a progress in knowledge is a function of the development of the object toward which insight directs itself... Marx demonstrates through the example of the category of labor also applies to objectifications in the arts... it is only with aestheticism that the full unfolding of the phenomenon of art became a fact, and it is to aestheticism that the historical avant-garde movements respondâ &lt;ref name="BCD"/&gt;

Besides from the idea of Karl Marx's influence over the avant-garde movement, much of the movement came through social commentary from the wars that were fought during the time of its rise. Dadaism, for instance, was seized upon by the group as appropriate for their anti-aesthetic creations and protest activities, which were engendered by disgust for bourgeois values and despair over World War I. Another example of this is John Hartfield's usage of photomontage to express his anti-Nazi views.&lt;ref name="DEF"/&gt;

===Relationship between the 1950s and 1980s===
As previously stated, as soon as many of the Dadaist movement from Europe immigrated over to the United States in the 1920s, they started making their art and presenting the art to the people of New York. Although it didn't initially take off, by the 1950s, their art and the art from artists that were inspired by these individuals began to rise in popularity.&lt;ref name="CDE"/&gt;

There were a number of factors that lead to the rise of avant-garde art in the eyes of the American Popular Culture. First of all, due to the rise of the American Economy after World War II, the American  Government focused on enhancing the importance of the Fine Arts. To do so, congress passed bills in which expanded the number of museums around the nation and funded the government to allow the artists to produce more art.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

===Increasing the Museums===
Before the 1940s, Americans in many regions were unaware to the existence of avant-garde art because, according to Dore Ashton, âAlthough culture... had penetrated the hinterland in the form of public libraries, literary societies, and even music circles, the plastic arts had... lagged far behindâ In order to increase the interest of the arts among the people and to allow them to be up-to-date with the rest of the world at that time, they decided to increase the number of museums in America from the 1940s to the 1980s.&lt;ref name = HIJ&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ashton, Dore|title=The New York School: A Cultural Reckoning.|publisher=Viking|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government Funding the Artist===
Along with the construction of museums, the Federal Government also realized that, to increase the interest of the people, there needed to be more art available. In addition to this, if the artists were to do so, they would need to form communities in which the artists could gather to produce their art. According to Sharon Zukin, â...real-estate developers profited from the increase in property values that resulted from the creation of an artistic community in Manhattan's SoHo district while political leaders benefited from the creation of a large pool of arts-related jobs.â Another reason the Federal Government felt a need to fund the artists at this time was to increase the patriotism of the people. If there was art depicting how grand, majestic, and free the United States of America is, they felt this would increase Patriotism among the people so the people would be willing to agree with whatever the government had to offer. According to Sharon Zukin, âThe willingness of federal and state governments to fund art and artists were political interests that used traveling exhibitions as propaganda for the American way of life.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;&lt;ref name = IJK&gt;{{Cite book|author=Zukin, Sharon|title=Loft Living: Culture and Capital in Urban Change.|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The influence of early avant-garde on later avant-garde===
When looking at all of the major movements of avant-garde that were influential from this time period, almost all of these art forms trace back to earlier avant-garde art forms, namely Dadaism. For instance, in practice, Abstract Expressionism was influenced by Dada by the fact that the art form had its similarities not in the way that the art was constructed, but rather from the concept that the genres exemplify. Pop Art also marks its influences from Dada because, like the âready-madesâ which used commonplace items in a way that they were not originally intended. For the case of Dada, the âready-madesâ consisted of items such as toilets as art. For the case of pop art, it could have been anything that proved influential in popular culture, whether it be comic strips, soup cans, or magazine advertisements.&lt;ref name="DEF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GHI"/&gt;

Another example of how an earlier avant-garde genre influenced a later genre was the example of Dada's influence of Punk fashion in the 1970s. Much like how the Dadaists used their art to reflect the ideal of  the belief in nothing and the wish to become nothing through their art (as they often referred it as anti-art), the Punk culture used the same ideals for their fashion and their music (by describing their music as anti-music). In addition to the two matching the same ideal, both used their mediums to reflect the same approach: to shock the community through their art and to speak a political, often Marxist, message through their works.&lt;ref name="EFG"/&gt;

===Relationship Between high culture and popular culture===
Stemming from its Dadaist beginnings, avant-garde was a movement that served as a contrast from typical Popular Culture. Under the guise of Dada, it started in Europe as a way to display their anti-art rhetoric as well as to communicate to the public their disgust for bourgeois values and their disapproval of World War I. In America, while the art was not much about protesting bourgeois values and the war, it still served as a way to protest against typical art values as well as to establish the high, artistic culture to contrast American popular culture.&lt;ref name = DEF&gt;âDadaâ EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. 2010. EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Online. 14 Nov. 2010 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/149499/Dada&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Abstract Expressionist and Minimalist art also served as a way to contrast popular culture. In Abstract Expressionist art, the approach to contrast from the depiction of real-world qualities by creating art using forms that do not exist in the real world. In Minimalist art, the approach was to contrast from the complicated works of the time, including those of fellow avant-garde genre Abstract Expressionism. Through this, the artist created their art with the sole intent of making art; not with a complicated political statement, not with a cultural reference, etc. It solely was art for art itself.&lt;ref name="CDE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FGH"/&gt;

However, Pop art and its practitioners, while continuing to do some contrast between high culture and popular culture, began to blur the two by using elements of popular culture and transforming those images in a way which were not the original intent of those elements, much like the ready-mades of the Dadaist artists before them. It sometimes came through subverting the images coloration, such as what Andy Warhol did with pictures of soup cans and actress Marilyn Monroe. In other times, it came through taking a comic strip out of its initial context and using that for a piece. However, despite trying to contrast the two, at many times many of the artists became celebrities in popular culture while practicing their contrast between that and the High Culture.&lt;ref name="GHI"/&gt;

==Avant-garde's demise==
After the end of the Pop Art movement, many art critics began to question the rising generation of artists who were influenced by the Pop artists shortly before, even to the point that some considered avant-garde dead. There are various reasons, but three primary indications for its demise are:[[File:Blinklv.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Blink-182 performing live in 2009.]]

# In their beginnings, the pop artists made a distinction between American Pop Culture and High Culture by changing the intent on items that provided a major impact on American society. However, as time went on, many of these same artists whose goals were to subvert well-known icons to fit their art became celebrities themselves. As a result, since many avant-garde artists who supported the High Culture began to be well known in Popular culture, the differences between the two cultures were becoming less distinguishable as time went on.&lt;ref name="GHI"/&gt;
# By the time the 1990s approached, the Punk movement began to be part of the American culture. Indications of this transition include the rise of punk-inspired grunge music provided by bands like Nirvana and the rise of pop-punk bands such as Green Day and Blink 182. As punk music began to increase in popularity by this time, the lyrics, fashion, and the music itself began to be saturated by Popular Culture until the point where most of its avant-garde influence seemed to be transparent.
# With the definition of high culture more vague than it was back in its inception, many artists attempted to create art that seemed similar to avant-garde, but rather than focusing on building up the High Culture, the art was rather made to create shock and to create art of the future. Such art that focused on shock and not about the social impact of the art were considered by art critics to be beginnings of Post-modernism.

The '''SFI Group System''' is the most widely used [[Classification|classification system]] for the [[Ship transport|maritime]] and offshore industry worldwide. It is an international standard, which provides a functional subdivision of technical and financial ship or rig information.

SFI consists of a technical account structure covering all aspects of ship/rig specification, and it can be used as a basic standard for all systems in the shipping/offshore industry.

More than 6000 SFI systems have been installed worldwide.

SFI is used by shipping and offshore companies, shipyards, consultancies, software suppliers, authorities and [[Classification society|classification societies]].

== Background, Purpose, and Advantages ==

=== Background ===
The '''SFI Group System''' was first released in 1972 as the result of a research project undertaken by the [[Ship Research Institute of Norway]] (SFI: Skipsteknisk Forskningsinstitutt). Today, sales, marketing and upgrading of the '''SFI Group System''' is undertaken by [http://www.spectec.net SpecTec].

=== Purpose and Advantages ===
The main purpose of the '''SFI Group System''' is to help shipping and offshore companies control operations by tying together all their procedures such as purchasing, accounting, maintenance, technical records, etc.
The '''SFI Group System''' provides major advantages for shipping and offshore operations in the following areas:
* Communication
* Computerisation
* Cooperation
* Cost Control
* Cost Comparison
* Development
* Education and Training
* Quality Control
* Standardisation

=== Scope ===
When the '''SFI Group System''' was established, the intention was that it should be capable of accommodating all relevant ship or rig types, and it should be a common code for the flow of information between different enterprises within the maritime and offshore industry.

The system should be independent of company organization and methods of ship building, ship operation, maintenance and repair. It should further lend itself to be updated with regard to new ship types and new technology. In order to meet the purpose of and the requirements to the system, the ships were divided into functions. The ship functions are common to all parties who are concerned with the specification, building and operation of ships.

In addition to the Group System with Detail Code, it may be necessary for each user to develop special codes, such as plan of finance accounts for budgeting and cost control of total company operation.

Shipyards using the '''SFI Group System''' for planning and control of production will require a supplementary company internal Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
Shipping companies using the '''SFI Group System''' for operation and maintenance planning and control, will require a coding system for consumables.

=== Controlling Shipping and Offshore Operations ===
The '''SFI Group System''' improves the control and quality assurance of activities such as maintenance, purchasing, accounting and record keeping within shipping and offshore operations.

SFI provides shipping and offshore companies, shipyards, authorities, suppliers and consultants with a common plan of technical account/codes in the handling of:
* Specifications
* Estimates
* Drawings
* Purchase
* Material Administration
* Maintenance and Repair Planning
* Instruction Material
* Budgets and Cost Control
* Files
The areas of system utilization are steadily increasing, and the system has contributed to increased efficiency in the maritime industry. The SFI Group Systemis a particularly useful tool when routines are being established according to the quality loop ([http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=41014 ref. ISO 9004, par. 5.1]).

[[File:SFI Quality Loop.jpg|thumb|right|SFI Quality Loop]]

=== Specifications ===
Specifications are normally established at different levels of detail: Outline, Contract, Building, As Built and Repair Specifications. Technical descriptions of components should be part of the As Built Specification and should follow the SFI Detail Code.

The database version of the Group System lends itself especially well to the development of the various specifications. A report generator makes it easy for the user to edit specifications according to requirements.
Specifications may be related to different Group System levels.
* Outline specifications to Primary Group level
* Functional requirements to Secondary Group level
* Functional solutions to Tertiary Group level
* Component selections to Detail Code level

=== Estimates ===
As estimates are based on specifications, they should follow the same breakdown structure. The estimates normally contain cost of material and working hours:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Code !! Name !! Hours !! Materials
|-
| 73 || Compressed air systems || ||
|-
| 731 || Starting air systems || 200 ||
|-
| 731.001 || Starting [[air compressor]] || || $150,000
|-
| 731.003 || Starting air emergency compressor ||  || $98,000
|-
| 731.005 || Starting air water/oil separator || || $17,000
|-
| 731.010 || Starting [[Pressure vessel|air tank]]s || || $33,000
|-
| 731.012 || Starting air bottles || || $9,500
|-
| 731.014 || Starting air coolers || || $12,000
|-
| 731.016 || Starting air compressor silencers || || $5,000
|}

=== Drawings and Document Handling ===
Drawings can easily be numbered according to SFI, and complex drawings in CAD systems may be split into layers to show individual installations according to the '''SFI Group System'''.

Drawing identification may incorporate a SFI Group System number. A standard drawing number may be composed as follows:

179-731-001
Ship no. â SFI tertiary group no. â Consecutive no.

Drawings should be numbered according to the group level if possible. The Primary and Secondary Group levels are usually used for system and arrangement drawings:

* 179-100-000: General arrangement
* 179-200-001: Profile and deck plan
* 179-350-000: Loading and discharging system
* 179-446-001: Engine stores arrangement

Item lists on arrangement drawings may also be coded according to the '''SFI Group System'''.

=== Purchasing ===
A purchase is normally charged to a finance account (cost type) and to a '''SFI Group System''' number, often called a technical account (cost center).

When purchasing components, a yard may specify the individual item by the SFI Detail Code (6 digits). When a shipping company orders spare parts, these may be identified by the SFI Detail Code + consecutive numbers (total of 9-10 digits).

=== Material Administration ===
When components are purchased directly to order/ship, the SFI Detail Code may be used as a technical account.

The spare part manufacturer may have its own numbering system. For a shipping company it is often convenient to establish a spare part numbering system comprising the SFI Detail Code + consecutive numbers:
* 731.001 - Starting air compressor
* 731.001.001 - HP cylinder
* 731.001.002 - LP cylinder
* 731.001.003 - HP cylinder cover
* 731.001.004 - LP cylinder cover

=== Maintenance ===
An operation and maintenance system will often contain a register covering all maintenance units on board. These units are normally identical to the components in the Detail Code:

731.001.01 - Starting air compressor no. 1
Maker:
Type:
Serial no.:
Capacity:

Procedures for preventive maintenance and class survey of a maintenance unit will be entered with job identification:

731.001.01 - Starting air compressor no. 1
Job A - 3000 hours routine
Job B - Class survey

All records of preventive and corrective maintenance should be filed and related to the maintenance unit. The technical accounts of planned maintenance systems such as [http://www.spectec.net/en/maritime/amos-maintenance-and-procurement AMOS Maintenance and Procurement] are commonly based on the '''SFI Group System'''.

=== Repair ===
Repair specifications are often based on information from the maintenance system. The repair bill should follow the repair specification structure. It is customary for the yard to quote prices to the shipping company at subgroup level.

=== Operation Budget ===
The '''SFI Group System''' is used for budgeting of maintenance and repair work, and for spare part consumption. In order to make a complete operation budget in a shipping company, it is necessary to link the Group System to a plan of finance accounts. Any suitable plan of finance accounts may be used together with SFI.

The plan of finance accounts usually covers spare parts and consumable items. Budgeting of spare parts may be performed in great detail using the '''SFI Group System'''.

=== Cost Control ===
[[Cost accounting|Cost control]] of new building or repair work is normally carried out at the tertiary Group and Detail Code levels. Direct purchases are charged to the SFI Detail Code:

Materials:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Code !! Name !! Planned !! Actual !! Difference
|-
| 731.001 || Starting air compressor || 150,000 || 158,000 || +8,000
|}

Reporting of working hours is normally carried out at the tertiary group level. Activities and jobs must be established to follow up work progress.

Materials:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Code !! Name !! Planned !! Actual !! Difference
|-
| 731 || Starting air systems || 200 || 210 || +10
|}

=== Quality Assurance ===
In relation to [http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso_9000.htm ISO 9000] and [http://www.imo.org/en/Pages/Default.aspx IMO] requirements for safe operation, it is necessary to establish procedures that ensure that specification requirements and rules and regulations from authorities and classification societies are met, and that the ship/rig is operated safely.

The following procedures and instructions should be classified according to SFI:
* Surveyorâs manual
* Installation description

=== Filing ===
The '''SFI Group System''' is often used as a standard filing system for the shipping and offshore industry. SFI gives this industry a well structured and organized filing system for drawings, manuals, reports, and publications.
* Testing and commissioning procedures
* Operating, start and stop manuals
* Maintenance instructions
* Faultfinding
* Spare parts
* Tools
* List of drawings
* Certificates
* Agents

== The Coding Structure of SFI ==

=== SFI Group System (3-digit) ===
[[File:SFI Triangle.png|thumb|right|Primary Group 7]]
The SFI Group System is built up as a 3-digit decimal classification system. The ship/rig is divided into 10 Primary Groups from 0 to 9. Only Primary Groups 1 to 8 are in use. The users may use Primary Groups 0 and 9 for classifying other main components that are not covered by the SFI standard.

Each of the Primary Groups (1st digit) consists of 10 Groups (2nd digit) and each Group is divided further into 10 subgroups (3rd digit).
The Primary Groups (1st digit) of SFI for Ships is described below.

==== Primary Group 1 - General ====
Details and costs that cannot be charged to any specific function on board, e.g. general arrangement, quality assurance, launching, dry-docking and guarantee 
work.

==== Primary Group 2 - Hull Systems ====
Hull, superstructure and material protection of the vessel.

==== Primary Group 3 - Cargo Equipment ====
Cargo equipment and machinery including systems for vesselâs cargo, loading/discharging systems, cargo winches and hatches.

==== Primary Group 4 - Ship Equipment ====
Ship specific equipment- and machinery. Navigational equipment, manoeuvring machinery, anchoring equipment, and communication equipment. This group also includes special equipment such as equipment for fishing.

==== Primary Group 5 - Crew and Passenger Equipment ====
Equipment, machinery, systems etc. serving crew and passengers, for example lifesaving equipment, furniture, catering equipment and sanitary systems.

==== Primary Group 6 - Machinery Main Components ====
Primary components in the engine room, for example main and auxiliary engines, propellers, plant, boilers, and generators.

==== Primary Group 7 - Systems for Machinery Main Components ====
Systems serving main machinery components, for example fuel and lubrication oil systems, starting air system, exhaust systems and automation systems.

==== Primary Group 8 - Common Systems ====
Central ship systems, for example ballast and bilge systems, fire fighting and wash down systems, electrical distribution systems etc.

=== SFI Detail and Material Codes (6 digit) ===
The detail and material codes cover components and materials that may be related to the individual subgroups. In order to reach the component level, it might be necessary to break the subgroups further down by using a detail code. This code has not yet been possible to standardize due to the variety of equipment and numbers onboard different types of ships, and due to slightly different requirements to the code for shipyards and shipping companies.

Usually there are two different classes of components and material that are used; one class comprises components and material that are ordered directly to a ship, the other comprises components and material that are ordered to stock. Consequently, the codes are divided into two parts:

'''Detail Code''': Components that are purchased directly to order/ship. The detail code is used to define the individual component and equipment that acts in the sub system function. In the Detail Code the supplementary codes are built up from 001-099.

'''Material Code''': This code relates to material that is purchased to stock.
The relations between these codes are as follows:
* SFI Group System + Detail Code: 731.000 â 731.099
* SFI Group System + Material Code: 731.100 â 731.999

== User Rights for the SFI Group System ==

=== SFI User License ===
An SFI User License Certificate must be purchased from SpecTec to use the '''SFI Group System'''. One license fee will be charged for each SFI installation. This means that one license is required for each ship/site/rig that uses the coding structure of SFI. There are additional charges for each book, file or database.

== Formats of the SFI Group System ==

=== SFI Manuals ===
The SFI manuals are available in the following formats:
* A4
* A5
* A6
* Letter
The A4, A5, and Letter manuals contain the following parts:
* SFI Code Matrix
* Summary lists of primary, secondary, and tertiary groups
* Detailed descriptions of secondary and tertiary groups
* Detail Codes
* Material Codes
* Keyword register
The A6 pocket manual contains:
* SFI Code Matrix
* Summary of primary, secondary, and tertiary groups
* Keyword register

== Conclusion ==
A classification system such as the '''SFI Group System''' will make a substantial contribution to standardized and well-ordered information related to ships/rigs, and will lead to improved communication both within a company and with external parties.

The '''SFI Group System''' will make shipping and offshore operations more efficient because companies will save resources and avoid pitfalls when implementing the SFI standards. SFI can be the common denominator tying together all functions of shipping and offshore operations such as maintenance, purchasing, accounting, filing etc.

[[File:Sehnsucht zwintscher.jpg|{{largethumb}}|{{lang|de|Sehnsucht}} by {{lang|de|[[Oskar Zwintscher]]|italic=no}}, {{circa|1900}}]]
'''{{lang|de|Sehnsucht}}''' ({{IPA-de|ËzeËnËzÊxt}}) is a [[German language|German]] noun translated as "longing", "pining", "yearning", or "craving",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dict.leo.org/german-english/sehnsucht |title=LEO Results for "sehnsucht"}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some psychologists use the word {{lang|de|Sehnsucht}} to represent thoughts and feelings about all facets of life that are unfinished or imperfect, paired with a yearning for ideal alternative experiences.&lt;ref name="Reference 1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kotter-GrÃ¼hn |first=D. |last2=Wiest |first2=M. |last3=Zurek |first3=P. |last4=Scheibe |first4=S. |title=What is it we are longing for?

[[File:Sehnsucht Susanne KraiÃer.jpg|thumb|{{lang|de|Sehnsucht}}, sculpture by {{lang|de|[[Susanne KraiÃer]]|italic=no}}]]
Psychologists have worked to capture the essence of {{lang|de|Sehnsucht}} by identifying its six core characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scheibe |first=S. |last2=Freund |first2=A. M. |last3=Baltes |first3=P. B. |title=Toward a developmental psychology of Sehnsucht (life longings): The optimal (utopian) life |journal=Developmental Psychology |year=2007 |volume=43 |pages=778â795 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.43.3.778 |pmid=17484587 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# utopian conceptions of ideal development;
# sense of incompleteness and imperfection of life;
# conjoint time focus on the past, present, and future;
# ambivalent (bittersweet) emotions;
# reflection and evaluation of one's life; and
# symbolic richness.

In a cross-cultural study conducted to determine whether the German concept of {{lang|de|Sehnsucht}} could be generalized to the United States, four samples of American and German participants ârated their 2 most important life longings and completed measures of subjective well-being and health.â&lt;ref name="Reference 2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scheibe |first=S. |last2=Blanchard-Fields |first2=F. |last3=Wiest |first3=M. |last4=Freund |first4=A. M. |title=Is longing only for Germans? A cross-cultural comparison of sehnsucht in Germany and the United States |journal=Developmental Psychology |year=2011 |doi=10.1037/a0021807 |volume=47 |pages=603â618 |pmid=21219068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; German and American participants did not differ in their ability to identify life longings or the intensity of their {{lang|de|Sehnsucht}}. However, German participants associated it more with unattainable, utopian states while Americans reported the concept as not as important to everyday life.

Some researchers posit that {{lang|de|Sehnsucht}} has a developmental function that involves life management. By imagining overarching and possibly unachievable goals, individuals may be able to create direction in their life by developing more tangible goals, or âstepping stonesâ that will aid them on their path toward their ideal self. "[{{lang|de|Sehnsucht}} has] important developmental functions, including giving directionality for life planning and helping to cope with loss and important, yet unattainable wishes by pursuing them in one's imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scheibe |first=S. |last2=Freund |first2=A. M. |title=Approaching Sehnsucht (life longings) from a life-span perspective: The role of personal utopias in development |journal=Research in Human Development |year=2008 |pages=121â133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also operate as a self-regulatory mechanism.

However, in a study that attempted to discover whether {{lang|de|Sehnsucht}} played an active role in oneâs ability to influence their own development, psychologists asked 81 participants to report âtheir most important personal goals and life longings, and [evaluate] these with respect to their cognitive, emotional, and action-related characteristics.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mayser |first=S. |last2=Scheibe |first2=S. |last3=Riediger |first3=M. |title=(Un)reachable? An empirical differentiation of goals and life longings |journal=European Psychologist |year=2008 |volume=13 |pages=126â140 |doi=10.1027/1016-9040.13.2.126 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results showed that goals were perceived as more closely linked to everyday actions, and as such more controllable. {{lang|de|Sehnsucht}}, on the other hand, was reported as more related to the past and future, and therefore more emotionally and developmentally ambiguous.

Also, in a study conducted in 2009, 168 middle-aged childless women were asked to rate their wish for children according to intensity and attainability. If the women rated their wish as intense and long-standing, their wish was considered a life-longing. If they rated their wish as intense and attainable, it was simply a goal. âThe pursuit of the wish for children as a life longing was positively related to well-being only when participants had high control over the experience of this life longing and when other self-regulation strategies (goal adjustment) failed.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kotter-GrÃ¼hn |first=D. |last2=Scheibe |first2=S. |last3=Blanchard-Fields |first3=F. |last4=Baltes |first4=P.

{{short description|Not requiring outside inputs to meet needs}}

'''Self-sustainability''' and '''self-sufficiency''' are overlapping states of being in which a person or organization needs little or no help from, or interaction with, others. Self-sufficiency entails the [[self]] being enough (to fulfill needs), and a self-sustaining entity can maintain self-sufficiency indefinitely. These states represent types of personal or collective [[autonomy]].&lt;ref name="Kains" /&gt; On a national scale, a totally self-sufficient [[economy]] that requires little or no trade with the outside world is called an [[autarky]]. Absolute purity of personal self-sufficiency or national autarky is a theoretical concept rather than a reality, but relative degrees are observable in real-world examples. 

Self-sustainability is a type of [[sustainable living]] in which nothing is consumed other than what is produced by the self-sufficient individuals. Examples of attempts at self-sufficiency in [[North America]] include [[simple living]], [[homesteading]], [[off-the-grid]], [[survivalism]], [[DIY ethic]] and the [[back-to-the-land movement]].

Practices that enable or aid self-sustainability include [[autonomous building]], [[permaculture]], [[sustainable agriculture]], and [[renewable energy]]. The term is also applied to limited forms of self-sustainability, for example growing one's own food or becoming economically independent of state [[subsidy|subsidies]]. The self-sustainability of an electrical installation measures its degree of grid independence and is defined as the ratio between the amount of locally produced energy that is locally consumed, either directly or after storage, and the total consumption.&lt;ref name="Silva-Hendrick" /&gt;

A system is self-sustaining (or self-sufficient) if it can  maintain itself by independent effort. The system self-sustainability is:

# the degree at which the system can sustain itself without external support
# the fraction of time in which the system is  self-sustaining

Self-sustainability is considered one of the [[list of system quality attributes|"ilities"]] and is closely related to [[sustainability]] and [[availability]].  In the [[economics]] literature, a system that has the quality of being self-sustaining is also referred to as an [[autarky]].

==Formal definition==

#  Let  &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be a random variable that denotes the  steady state number of external entities on which the system depends.  Let &lt;math&gt;p(v) &lt;/math&gt; be the probability that the system depends on &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; external entities,  &lt;math&gt;p(v)=P(E=v)&lt;/math&gt;.  Then, the system self-sustainability,  &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;,  is &lt;math&gt;S=p(0)&lt;/math&gt;.
#  Let &lt;math&gt;e_t&lt;/math&gt; be the expected time during which the system is self-sustaining from time 0 up to time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the system self-sustainability is the steady state fraction of time in which it is self-sustaining,  &lt;math&gt;S=\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} {e_t}/{t}&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

===Political states===

[[Autarky]] exists whenever an entity can survive or continue its activities without external assistance. Autarky is not necessarily economic. For example, a military autarky would be a state that could defend itself without help from another country.

===Labor===

According to the Department of Labor of the state of  Idaho, an employed adult shall be considered self-sufficient if the family income exceeds 200% of the Office of Management and Budget poverty income level guidelines.&lt;ref name="labor"&gt;IDAHO Department of Labor (1999). [http://labor.idaho.gov/wia1/policies/wiap7-99.pdf "Definition of Self-sufficiency."] Retrieved on 2010-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peer-to-peer swarming===

In peer-to-peer swarming systems, a swarm is self-sustaining if all the  blocks  of its files are available among peers (excluding seeds and publishers).&lt;ref name="p2p"&gt;Menasche, Rocha, de Souza e Silva, Leao, Towsley, Venkataramani (2010).  [https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0395 "Estimating self-sustainability in peer-to-peer swarming systems"] Retrieved on 2010-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==

===Self-sustainability and survivability===

Whereas self-sustainability is a quality of oneâs independence,  [[survivability]] applies to the future maintainability of oneâs self-sustainability and indeed oneâs existence. Many believe that more self-sustainability guarantees a higher degree of survivability. But just as many oppose this, arguing that it is not self-sustainability that is essential for survivability, but on the contrary specialization and thus dependence.&lt;ref name="survival"&gt;What and Who is Self-Sufficient? by Katrien Vander Straeten&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider the first two  examples presented above.  Among countries, commercial treats are as important as self-sustainability. An [[autarky]] is usually inefficient. Among people, social ties have been shown to be correlated to happiness and success as much as self-sustainability.&lt;ref name="SocialNets"&gt;{{youtube|id=6a_KF7TYKVc|title=Social Networks in Plain English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5177">The '''State of World [[Liberty]] Index''' was a ranking of countries according to the degree of economic and personal freedoms that their citizens enjoy. It was a compilation of several similar indices created by other organizations. The index's original author Nick Wilson defined [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] as "the ability for the individual to live their lives as they choose, as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others to do the same." 

Only one report (the 2006 State of World Liberty Index, released 12 August 2006) was produced by the State of World Liberty Project and the original website is now defunct.  However, Patrick Rhamey, professor in the Department of International Studies at the Virginia Military Institute [http://www.vmi.edu/Content.aspx?id=4294974229], has updated the rankings through 2018 using the same concept, with some adjustments to the original method [http://patrickrhamey.com/saturday-research/2018/8/6/2018-state-of-world-liberty-index].

The index has been cited by human rights organisations,&lt;small&gt;[http://www.globalhrnews.com/b4/b4home.asp?sid=896]&lt;/small&gt; governments,&lt;small&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.lv/en/news/Newsletters/CurrentLatvia/2006/august/672/]&lt;/small&gt; pro-democracy groups,&lt;small&gt;[http://www.alausa.org/new.php?lang=en&amp;new=&amp;id=19] [http://www.e-democracy.md/en/e-journal/20060831/]&lt;/small&gt; news organisations,&lt;small&gt;[http://www.aruzza.com/documents/new_york_times.pdf] [http://www.eurasianet.org/turkmenistan.project/index.php?page=wnb/editor/wnb20060811&amp;lang=eng] [http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/mail/?nid=19034]&lt;/small&gt; and others.&lt;small&gt;[http://www.ccmbl.md/news_e_08_06.htm] [http://www.dnbnord.com/multimedia/BE_Weekly_122_eng.pdf] [http://www.sarke.ge/nato/image/EU-NATO%20prezentation(1).ppt#299,23,GOOD%20GOVERNANCE]&lt;/small&gt;

==Methodology==
The 2006 State of World Liberty Index was created by combining the rankings of four other indexes of world liberty into one: the "2005 Economic Freedom of the World" Index ([[Fraser Institute]]/[[The Cato Institute|Cato Institute]]), the "2006 Index of Economic Freedom" ([[The Heritage Foundation]]/[[Wall Street Journal]]), the "2005 Freedom in the World" index ([[Freedom House]]), and the "2005 Press Freedom Index" ([[Reporters Without Borders]]). 

These reports are used to score countries in three categories: individual freedom, [[economic freedom]], and government size and [[taxation]].  These three scores are then averaged to give a country's overall score.

==2006 rankings==
In the 2006 index, [[Estonia]] was ranked most free overall, with a score of 85.25; [[North Korea]] was last with a score of 6.80.  [[Hong Kong]] was ranked most free in both the economic liberty category and the government size and taxation category, but a personal freedom score of only 61.74 greatly reduced its overall ranking. 

Thirty-five countries (22%) scored above 99 in the individual freedom category.

==2018 rankings==
The [http://patrickrhamey.com/saturday-research/2018/8/6/2018-state-of-world-liberty-index 2018 Rankings] reproduce the original ranking concept using the same data sources, albeit adjusting the weighting of data to best capture the original intent of measuring "the ability of the individual to live their lives as they choose."  Measures are also standardized appropriately given the different scales used across indices and the government burden category was condensed into the broader indicator of economic freedom.  

In the 2018 index, [[New Zealand]] is ranked most free overall, while [[North Korea]] is last.  [[Hong Kong]] was ranked most free in economic liberty, while [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] were ranked most free in the social liberty category.

'''Statistical finance''',&lt;ref&gt;J-P Bouchaud, An introduction to Statistical Finance, Physica A 313 (2002) 238&amp;ndash;251&lt;/ref&gt; is the application of [[econophysics]]&lt;ref&gt;V. Perou, E. Gopikrishnan, L A Amaral, M. Meyer, H. E. Stanley, Phys. Rev. E 60 6519 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; to [[financial market]]s. Instead of the [[Normative economics|normative]] roots of much of the field of [[finance]], it uses a [[positivist]] framework including exemplars from [[statistical physics]] with an emphasis on emergent or collective properties of financial markets. The starting point for this approach to understanding financial markets are the empirically observed [[stylized fact]]s.

==Stylized facts ==

# Stock markets are characterised by bursts of price volatility.
# Price changes are less volatile in bull markets and more volatile in bear markets.
# Price change correlations are stronger with higher volatility, and their auto-correlations die out quickly.
# Almost all real data have more extreme events than suspected.
# Volatility correlations decay slowly.
# Trading volumes have memory the same way that volatilities do.
# Past price changes are negatively correlated with future volatilities.

== Research objectives ==

Statistical finance is focused on three areas:

# Empirical studies focused on the discovery of interesting statistical features of financial time-series data aimed at extending and consolidating the known [[stylized fact]]s.
# The use of these discoveries to build and implement models that better price derivatives and anticipate stock price movement with an emphasis on [[non-Gaussian]] methods and models.
# The study of collective and emergent behaviour in simulated and real markets to uncover the mechanisms responsible for the observed stylized facts with an emphasis on [[agent-based model]]s.

It is noteworthy that [[financial econometrics]] also has a focus on the first two of these three areas. However, there is almost no overlap or interaction between the community of statistical finance researchers (who typically publish in physics journals) and the community of financial econometrics researchers (who typically publish in economics journals).

== Behavioral finance and statistical finance ==

Behavioural finance attempts to explain price anomalies in terms of the biased behaviour of individuals, mostly concerned with the agents themselves and to a lesser degree aggregation of agent behaviour. Statistical finance is concerned with emergent properties arising from systems with many interacting agents and as such attempts to explain price anomalies in terms of the collective behaviour. Emergent properties are largely independent of the uniqueness of individual agents because they are dependent on the nature of the interactions of the agents rather than the agents themselves. This approach has drawn strongly on ideas arising from [[complex systems]], [[phase transitions]],  [[Critical phenomena|criticality]], [[self-organized criticality]], non-extensivity (see [[Tsallis entropy]]), q-Gaussian models,  and agents based models (see [[agent based model]]); as these are known to be able to recover some of phenomenology of financial market data, the [[stylized fact]]s, in particular the [[long-range memory]] and scaling due to long-range interactions.

== Criticism ==

Within the subject the description of financial markets blindly in terms of models of statistical physics has been argued as flawed because it has transpired these do not fully correspond to what we now know about real finance markets. First, traders create largely noise, not long range correlations among themselves, except when they all buy or all sell, such as during a popular IPO or during a crash.  A market is not at an equilibrium critical point, the resulting non-equilibrium market must reflect details of traders' interactions (universality applies only to a limited very class of bifurcations, and the market does not sit at a bifurcation). Even if the notion of a thermodynamics equilibrium is considered not at the level of the agents but in terms of collections of instruments stable configurations are not observed. The market does not 'self-organize' into a stable statistical equilibrium, rather, markets are unstable. Although markets could be 'self-organizing' in the sense used by [[finite-time singularity]] models these models are difficult to falsify. Although Complex systems have never been defined in a broad sense financial markets do satisfy reasonable criterion of being considered complex adaptive systems.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Market Complexity, Johnson, Jefferies and Hui, Oxford 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Tallis doctrine has been put into question as it is apparently a special case of markov dynamics so questioning the very notion of a "non-linear Fokker-Plank equation". In addition, the standard 'stylized facts' of financial markets, fat tails, scaling, and universality are not observed in real FX markets even if they are observed in equity markets.

From outside the subject the approach has been considered by many as a dangerous view of finance which has drawn criticism from some [[heterodox economics|heterodox economists]] because of:&lt;ref&gt;[[Mauro Gallegati]], [[Steve Keen]], [[Thomas Lux]] and [[Paul Ormerod]], ''Worrying Trends in Econophysics'', [[Physica A]] '''370''', 1-6 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; 
# "A lack of awareness of work which has been done within economics itself."
# "Resistance to more rigorous and robust statistical methodology."
# "The belief that universal empirical regularities can be found in many areas of economic activity."
# "The theoretical models which are being used to explain empirical phenomena."
In response to these criticism there are claims of a general maturing of these non-traditional empirical approaches to Finance.&lt;ref&gt;"Response to worrying trends in econophysics", McCauley, J. L. Physica A 2.371(2006): pp. 601&amp;ndash;609 http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/2129/1/MPRA_paper_2129.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This defense of the subject does not flatter the use of physics metaphors but does defend the alternative empirical approach of "econophysics" itself.

Some of the key data claims have been questioned in terms of methods of data analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin E. Bassler, Joseph L. McCauley, and Gemunu H. Gunaratne, Nonstationary increments, scaling distributions, and variable diffusion processes in financial markets, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 104, 17287-17290 (2007). http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0708664104&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the ideas arising from nonlinear sciences and statistical physics have been helpful in shifting our understanding financial markets, and may yet be found useful, but the particular requirements of stochastic analysis to the specific models useful in finance is apparently unique to finance as a subject. There is much lacking in this approach to finance yet it would appear that the canonical approach to finance based optimization of individual behaviour given information and preferences with assumptions to allow aggregation in equilibrium are even more problematic.

It has been suggested that what is required is a change in mindset within finance and economics that moves the field towards methods of natural science.&lt;ref&gt;J-P. Bouchaud, Economics needs a scientific revolution https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.5306v1&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps finance needs to be thought of more as an observational science where markets are observed in the same way as the observable universe in cosmology, or the observable ecosystems in the environmental sciences. Here local principles can be uncovered by local experiments but meaningful global experiments are difficult to envision as feasible without reproducing the system being observed. The required science becomes that based largely on pluralism (see [[scientific pluralism]] the view that some phenomena observed in science require multiple explanations to account for their nature), as in most sciences that deal with complexity, rather than a singled unified mathematical framework that is to be verified by experiment.

==Education==
Smalley majored in biological anthropology at the [[University of Michigan]], and as an undergraduate became interested in [[population genetics]] and [[human evolution]].  She received a BA in anthropology in 1976, and in 1981 earned an MA in anthropology from [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. She was awarded a Ph.D in anthropology with specialization in population genetics from UCLA in 1985.  Her dissertation examined the genetics of [[Spatial visualization ability|spatial ability]].&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt;  
==Career==
===ADHD and behavior genetics===
Smalley joined the faculty at UCLA after she completed post-doctoral fellowships in [[medical genetics]] and [[Child psychopathology|childhood psychopathology]], moving from assistant to full professor until her retirement to emeritus in 2011.&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ucla.academia.edu/SueSmalley/CurriculumVitae|title=Sue Smalley at the University of California, Los Angeles|website=ucla.academia.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 she published a review paper on the genetics of autism in ''[[JAMA Psychiatry]]''. Following its publication, she received a [[National Institute of Health]] (NIH) grant to investigate genetic determinants in autism, and pioneered an approach to behavioral genetics by studying known genetic disorders with behavioral [[Sequela|sequelae]], specifically, the study of [[Tuberous sclerosis complex|tuberous sclerosis complex]], (TSC), a genetic disorder in which autistic disorder occurs at higher rates than the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Susan|first=Smalley,|title=Detection of Susceptibility Genes in Adhd|url=http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/R01-MH058277-02|journal=NIH Grants|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to research autism for the following ten years, producing numerous papers on the genetics and subclinical variants of autism beyond the diagnostic classification as well as genetic and behavioral studies of TSC.&lt;ref name="NYT nature"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/health/healthguide/esn-adhd-expert.html?pagewanted=all|title=Nature, Nurture and Attention Deficit|last=Baruchin|first=Aliyah|date=2008-03-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smalley's focus subsequently shifted to ADHD.  Her lab produced more than 40 publications on the disorder, including the first genome-wide scan (in conjunction with investigators at [[Oxford University]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2002/10/021023065107.htm|title=UCLA Geneticists Find Location Of Major Gene In ADHD; Targeted Region Also Linked To Autism|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; candidate gene investigations, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/09_00/DRD4_gene.shtml|title=The DRD4 Gene: Psychiatry's Repeat Offender|work=Genome News Network|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of  papers on ADHD among a northern Finnish birth cohort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/28/health/he-adhd28|title=Growing up with, and out of, ADHD|last=Healy|first=Melissa|date=2008-01-28|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She wrote extensively on the strengths of those with ADHD, characterizing it as a different way of thinking rather than a deficit. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/26/opinion/oe-hallowell26|title=ADD's black box scare|last=Hallowell|first=Edward M.|date=2006-02-26|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-02-16|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mindful awareness===
Smalley was diagnosed with an early stage melanoma in 2002. She took a leave of absence to explore non-western wellness practices, and in addition to significant lifestyle changes, she developed a meditation practice.  When she returned to UCLA, she began researching mindfulness meditation and its impact on ADHD and other disorders. She subsequently led seminal studies that demonstrated the relationship between mindfulness and common personality traits of those with ADHD, mindfulness as an intervention in ADHD, and school-based approaches to bringing mindfulness to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-patricia-fitzgerald/what-inspired-a-scientist_b_228356.html|title=What Inspired A Scientist To Open A Meditation Center At UCLA?|last=Fitzgerald|first=Dr Patricia|date=2009-08-15|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and founded the Mindful Awareness Research Center at the UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior (MARC) to bring meditation practices to the general public through research and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/16/us/16mindful.html|title=In the Classroom, a New Focus on Quieting the Mind|last=Brown|first=Patricia Leigh|date=2007-06-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for the ''[[Huffington Post]]'',  she wrote: "As a scientist, I love the challenge of understanding my mind, from the inside, while learning what science tells us from the outside. The merging of these two approaches will yield knowledge far greater than either can alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-smalley/mindfulness-and-meditatio_b_64753.html|title=Mindfulness And Meditation In The Modern World|last=Ph.D|first=Susan Smalley|date=2007-09-18|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''temporal paradox''', '''time paradox''', or '''time travel paradox''' is a [[paradox]], an apparent contradiction, or a logical contradiction that is associated with the idea of time and time travel. In physics, temporal paradoxes fall into two broad groups: consistency paradoxes exemplified by the [[grandfather paradox]]; and [[causal loop]]s.&lt;ref name="lobo"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0206078v2.pdf |title= Time, Closed Timelike Curves and Causality |page=2 |author=Francisco Lobo |year=2002 |accessdate=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, a variation of the Fermi paradox also applies to [[time travel]].

==Causal loop==
{{main|Causal loop}}
A causal loop is a paradox of time travel that occurs when a future event is the cause of a past event, which in turn is the cause of the future event. Both events then exist in [[spacetime]], but their origin cannot be determined. A causal loop may involve an event, a person or object, or information.&lt;ref name="lobo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="standford-encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-travel/index.html#CauLoo |author=[[Nicholas J.J. Smith]] |date=2013 |title=Time Travel |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms boot-strap paradox, predestination paradox or ontological paradox are sometimes used in fiction to refer to a causal loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/web/Research/TechReports/TR2013-950/TR2013-950.pdf |title=Foundations of a Formal Theory of Time Travel |page=6 |author= Leora Morgenstern |year=2010 |accessdate=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klosterman2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klosterman |first1=Chuck |title=Eating the Dinosaur |date=2009 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |isbn=9781439168486 |page=60 |edition=1st Scribner hardcover |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lZurDFJtAWwC&amp;pg=PA60 |accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Grandfather paradox==
{{main|Grandfather paradox}}
The consistency paradox or grandfather paradox occurs when the past is changed in any way, thus creating a contradiction. A time traveler ''can'' do anything that ''did'' happen, but ''can't'' do anything that ''didn't'' happen. Doing something that didn't happen results in a contradiction.&lt;ref name="standford-encyclopedia" /&gt; Consistency paradoxes occur whenever changing the past is possible.&lt;ref name="lobo" /&gt;

==Fermi paradox==
{{main|Time travel#Absence of time travelers from the future}}
The [[Fermi paradox]] can be adapted for time travel, and phrased "if time travel were possible, where are all the visitors from the future?" Answers vary, from time travel not being possible, to the possibility that visitors from the future can not reach any arbitrary point in the past, or that they disguise themselves to avoid detection.&lt;ref name="sagan-nova"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/time/sagan.html |title=Carl Sagan Ponders Time Travel|work=NOVA|date=December 10, 1999|publisher=[[PBS]]|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Pawnee capture of the Cheyenne Sacred Arrows''''' occurred around 1830 in central [[Nebraska]], when the [[Cheyenne]] attacked a group from the [[Skidi|Skidi Pawnee]] tribe, who were hunting [[bison]]. The Cheyenne had with them their [[sacred bundle]] of four [[arrow]]s, called the Mahuts. During the battle, this sacred, ceremonial object was taken by the Pawnee. The Cheyenne initially made replica arrows but also tried to get the originals back. They recovered one from the Pawnee directly, either given to them or taken by them, and a second was captured by the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] and returned to the Cheyenne in exchange for horses. The two corresponding replicas were ceremonially returned to the [[Black Hills]], where the arrows were traditionally believed to have originated. Eventually the bundles were re-established and the societies and their ceremonies continue into the present day. 

==Background==
Likely, the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] lived in villages of earth lodges in the present-day state of [[Nebraska]]&lt;ref name=Blaine1990&gt;Blaine, Martha R. (1990): ''Pawnee Passage, 1870-1875''.

The Chawi, the Kitkahahki and the Pitahawirata made up the South Bands&lt;ref name=Murie1981/&gt;{{rp|183, 195 and 199}} as they lived south of the [[Platte River]].&lt;ref name=Murie1981/&gt;{{rp|4}} &lt;ref name=Blaine1990/&gt;{{rp|72}} Just some years later, they would move north and gather in the same area as the Skidi Pawnee.&lt;ref name=Jensen1994&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jensen |first1=Richard E |title=The Pawnee Mission, 1834-1846 |journal=[[Nebraska History]] |date=1994 |volume=75 |pages=301-310 |url=https://history.nebraska.gov/sites/history.nebraska.gov/files/doc/publications/NH1994PawneeMission.pdf |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|305}} The Pawnee raised corn and other crops near their villages. However, they went on long communal [[bison]] hunts in both summer and winter. While out on the [[Great Plains|plains]], they lived in skin tents and [[tipi]]s.&lt;ref name=Blaine1990/&gt;{{rp|71-84}}

The final groups of Cheyenne Indians seem to have crossed the [[Missouri River]] from eastern [[North Dakota]] in the last quarter of the 18th century.

The renewal of the arrows form one of the most [[sacred]] of the Cheyenne ceremonies, and traditionally take place during the same time every summer, as well as in response to unfortunate events, such as a homicide or other tragedy.&lt;ref name="Schaefer2008"/&gt;{{rp|268}}

==Prelude==
A year before this historic battle, a party of Cheyenne warriors intended to raid the Pawnee near the lower Platte. The party was discovered and all killed, just as the Cheyenne had done ten years before after the killing of thirty Cheyenne [[Cheyenne military societies#Bowstring|Bowstring]] warriors by the Crow. The tribe vowed to avenge the war group by moving the against those to blame for the killings.&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|49}}

In the summer of 1830, the entire Cheyenne tribe started down the Platte.{{efn|The year 1830 was agreed upon by a Cheyenne and a Pawnee, both participating in the battle.&lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|556}} Although some give the year as 1833.&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|48}}}} A number of allied [[Lakota people|Lakota]] and [[Arapaho]] joined. The special custodian or keeper of the Sacred Arrows, White Thunder, and his wife led them.&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|49}} The scouts sent out to locate the enemy found no traces of the Pawnee. By chance, the group came across four messengers from a party of scouts, who had been killed by the Pawnee.&lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|557}} The scouts finally located a large camp of Pawnees at the head of the [[Loup River|South Loup]].&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|49}} (According to the Pawnee, they had camp somewhere on Platte River).&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dorsey |first1=George A. |authorlink1=George Amos Dorsey |title=How the Pawnee Captured the Cheyenne Medicine Arrows |journal=[[American Anthropologist]] |date=1903 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=644-658 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/658944 |accessdate=19 July 2018 |oclc=254963378}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|644}}

After marching for another day and night march, the body of people reached a place near the Pawnee camp in the early morning. The warriors prepared for battle. The women and children grouped in a circle where they had a view of the flat area soon to become a battlefield.&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|49}} &lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|558}} The Pawnee camp seems to have been hidden on the other side of a ridge.

The Cheyenne warriors and their allies placed themselves in two separate wings. The Sacred Arrows were in front of one wing, and the other wing would follow a man wearing the sacred Buffalo Hat. "These two great medicines protected all who were behind them ... and rendered the enemy in front helpless".&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|50}}

Meanwhile, the first bison hunters left the Pawnee camp and almost stumbled on the lined of the army. The battle was on, and White Thunder was unable to restrain the Cheyenne. Without having performed the required ceremony, he handed over the arrow bundle to a selected medicine man named Bull. Bull in turn hastily tied the whole bundle to the middle of his lance.&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|646}} Then he mounted his horse and tried to catch up with the rest of the warriors.&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|57}}

==Battle==
[[File:The area where the Pawnee captured the Sacred Arrows of the Cheyenne.jpg|thumb|upright 2.7|The area where the Pawnee captured the Sacred Arrows of the Cheyenne]]
"The battle was hard fought".&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|647}} An old Pawnee, apparently a Pitahawirata&lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|552}} from the South Bands, was sick and tired of living. He had told his relatives to carry him to the very [[front line]] of the battle.&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|645}} He was sitting on the ground with a bow and some arrows. Bull wanted to [[Counting coup|count coup]] on this enemy, although the rest of the Cheyenne tried to talk him from it.&lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|558}} The old Pawnee avoided the thrust with the lance and seized it. He dragged it from Bull, who slowly rode back to his own line. "This spear must be a wonderful spear ...", shouted the Pawnee, when he saw the medicine bundle in a wrapping of hide tied to it. The Pawnee rushed forward. Chief Big Eagle came first and secured the lance before the Cheyenne could recapture it.&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|649}}&lt;ref name="Powell1998"/&gt;{{rp|37}}

During the fight, Chief Big Eagle wore the Wonderful Leggings of Pahukatawa. The leggings were a part of a tribal war bundle, and they seemed to make Big Eagle fearless. "Through the power of these leggings the Skiri [Skidi] captured the wonderful Cheyenne arrows".&lt;ref name=MuriepartI&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Murie |first1=James R. |last2=Parks |first2=Douglas R. |title=Ceremonies of the Pawnee, Part I: The Skiri |journal=[[Smithsonian Contributions to Anthropology]] |date=1981 |volume=27 |url=https://repository.si.edu/handle/10088/1337 |accessdate=19 July 2018 |oclc=756235349}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|66}} Further, Big Eagle was dressed in a red shirt and wore a government medal on his breast. Throughout the battle, he rode on a small spotted horse. Therefore, the Cheyenne remembered him as Spotted Horse or Big Spotted Horse.&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|648}} &lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|552}}

According to the Cheyenne, they killed the old Pawnee on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|558}} The Pawnee say, he first died the next summer during a Cheyenne attack on an almost empty Pawnee village.&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|651}}

With the Sacred Arrows gone and [[morale]] low, the Cheyenne failed to withstand a renewed charge by the Pawnee and retreated.&lt;ref name="Powell1998"/&gt;{{rp|37-8}} "How many were killed on either side was not known".&lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|558}} Later, the Cheyenne retreated up the Platte, mourning the loss of the arrows, which [[George Bent]] described as "... the greatest disaster the Cheyennes ever suffered."&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|51}}&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|152}}

==Aftermath==
Pawnee Chief Big Eagle concluded they had captured something of extraordinary importance when he examined the arrows. He was keeper of the [[Pawnee mythology|Morning Star]] bundle of the Skidi Pawnee and placed three of the arrows in that bundle.&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|650}} &lt;ref name=MuriepartI/&gt;{{rp|66}} 

Some time after the battle, the best Cheyenne arrow makers made four surrogate Sacred Arrows.&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|53}}&lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|558-560}} However, they also tried in various ways to retrieve the originals. Once, they invited Big Eagle and the Pawnees to their camp. In return for the four arrows they promised the guests many horses. Big Eagle expected treachery and brought just one arrow wrapped in a bundle. As feared, a Cheyenne rode away with the arrow in an unguarded moment.&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|657}} Another source recounts that three Cheyenne, White Thunder, Old Bark, and Doll Man traveled to a Skidi village in 1835 where they were received in Big Eagle's lodge and given one Buffalo Arrow. Despite gifts of more than a hundred horses, no more arrows were returned.&lt;ref name="Powell1998"/&gt;{{rp|39}} 

[[File:Lakota winter counts showing the Sacred Arrow of the Cheyennes returned in 1843.jpg|thumb|upright 0.9|Pictures from two Lakota winter counts, 1843-1844. A Sacred Arrow of the Cheyenne was returned by the Lakota.]]

They recognized the Man Arrow and returned it to the Cheyenne in exchange for one hundred horses.&lt;ref name="Powell1998"/&gt;{{rp|39}}&lt;ref name=Mallory1886/&gt;{{rp|141}} 

Two of the remade Sacred Arrows were now in excess. A ceremony was held, and the Cheyenne left two of the new arrows in a bundle in a crevice of the Black Hills, near the place where Sweet Medicine had received the original arrows. There they remained for a long while, and were occasional visited by Cheyenne travelers, before eventually disappearing.&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|55}}&lt;ref name="Grinnell2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grinnell|first=George Bird|title=The Cheyenne Indians: Their History and Lifeways : Edited and Illustrated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzxHTeOe8FcC|year=2008|publisher=[[World Wisdom]]|isbn=978-1-933316-60-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|224}}

Efforts to restore the additional two original arrows were again made in the 1890s and 1930s to no avail.&lt;ref name="Powell1998"/&gt;{{rp|40-1}} The return of the remaining arrows remained a source of bitterness for generations.&lt;ref name="Lookingbill2015"/&gt;

{{sociology}}
'''Traditional authority''' (also known as traditional domination) is a form of [[leadership]] in which the authority of an [[organization]] or a [[ruling regime]] is largely tied to [[tradition]] or custom. The main reason for the given state of affairs is that it 'has always been that way'.

==In sociology==
In [[sociology]], the concept of traditional authority (domination) comes from [[Max Weber]]'s [[tripartite classification of authority]], the other two forms being [[charismatic authority]] and [[rational-legal authority]]. All of those three domination types represent an example of his [[ideal type]] concept. Weber noted that in history those ideal types of domination are always found in combinations.

In traditional authority, the legitimacy of the authority comes from tradition; in charismatic authority from the personality and leadership qualities of the individual; and in rational-legal authority from powers that are [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratically]] and legally attached to certain positions.

===Patriarchs and their households===
Weber derives the traditional domination from [[patriarchy]]s and their householdsâin other words, from the ancient tradition of [[family]] (the authority of a master over his household). The master is designated in accordance with the rules of [[inheritance]]. He has no administrative staff nor any machinery to enforce his will by force alone; he depends on the willingness of the group members to respect his authority. Those members stand in personal relations to him. They obey him based on the belief that this is their duty sanctioned by immemorial tradition and on feeling of filial [[piety]] for the person of the master.

=== Patrimonialism ===

[[Patrimonialism|Patrimonial government]] occurs when the ruler's household expands with the  household administration giving rise to governmental offices. All officials are personal dependents or favourites of the ruler, appointed by him. Their interactions with the ruler are based on paternal authority and filial dependence. The officials treat their work as a personal service to the ruler. The ruler has complete control over the officials; he empowers them from case to case, assigns specific tasks, promotes and demotes. They have no rights, rather they have privileges granted and withdrawn by the ruler. It is rare to discover any clear and stable hierarchy and responsibility in the deluge of official titles of most patrimonial administrations.

[[Military]] force is an important instrument of a patrimonial rule. Weber distinguished five types of military organisations. In all of those cases the military is a tool of the ruler, solely for his useâbut he is responsible for its upkeep (equipment, maintenance and wages).

With the growth of the territory organized and more independent administrative staff and military force became a necessity. This usually leads to [[decentralisation]], and some individuals gain more independence in the form of certain rights (for example, the right to inheritance and marriage without the consent of the rulers, to be judged by independent courts instead of officials of the royal household, etc.).

One of the best examples of almost [[pure type]] of patrimonialism is [[ancient Egypt]], where the population was entirely dependent upon the control of the waterways ([[Nile River]]). This facilitated the creation of [[centralised government]]. When the royal household required it, the individual had to perform the public duties, such as participate in labor-intensive project (rising of the [[pyramids]]). Thus the whole country was in fact the patriarchal household of the [[pharaoh]].

When land is given to military or officials for the performance of their duties, their independence increases and the power of the ruler weakens (consider the [[Mameluks]] and their rebellions, or the difference between Chinese [[Confucian]] [[Scholar-bureaucrats|literati]] who were never able to overthrow the power of the [[emperor]] and [[Europe]]an [[knights]] who evolved into powerful [[aristocracy]] in many cases vastly limiting the power of the [[monarch|kings]] (especially in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]])).

Patrimonial dominance has often prevailed in the [[Orient]], where land remained in the control of the ruler. However, in the [[Western world|Occident]] the ruler lost control of the lands given to the nobility, which according to Weber was a major reason for patrimonialism being replaced by feudalism.

===Feudalism===
[[Feudalism]] when compared to patrimonalism, has one major similarity and several important differences.

The similarity is that both are based on tradition and have powerful rulers who grant rights in return for military and administrative services.

The differences are important for the subtler distinction:
* feudalism replaces the paternal relationship of patrimonalism by a contract of allegiance based on knightly militarism.
* the patrimonial ruler's grants of authority and the personal dependence of official are replaced in feudalism by the contractual freedom, personal allegiance and socioeconomic prominence on the part of the vassals.

==Traditional leaders==
Most of the representatives of any [[dynasty]] ruling for more than one generation ([[monarch|kings]], [[emperor]]s, [[sultan]]s, etc.) would fall into that category. Thus majority [[monarchy|monarchies]] and some [[Autocracy|autocracies]], [[Oligarchy|oligarchies]], and [[Theocracy|theocracies]] would be ruled by traditional leaders.

Often male head of a common family should be considered a traditional leader. This could also be the case in a family-owned business, if its director and other leader positions are chosen based on family ties and/or age.

'''Transformed cladistics''', also known as '''pattern cladistics''' is an epistemological approach to the [[cladistic]] method of phylogenetic inference and classification that makes no a priori assumptions about [[common ancestry]].  It was advocated by [[Norman Platnick]], [[Colin Patterson (biologist)|Colin Patterson]], Ronald Brady and others in the 1980s, but has few modern proponents.  The book, ''Foundations of Systematics and Biogeography''&lt;ref&gt;Williams, D. M. and M. C. Ebach. 2008. ''Foundations of Systematics and Biogeography''. Springer Science+Business Media, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; by David Williams and Malte Ebach provides a thoughtful history of the origins of this point of view.

==Patterns vs. processes==

The traditional approach to cladistics, which traces back to [[Willi Hennig]] &lt;ref&gt;Hennig, W. 1950. GrundzÃ¼ge einer Theorie der phylogenetischen Systematik. Deutscher Zentralverlag, Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hennig, W. 1966. Phylogenetic systematics. University of Illinois Press, Urbana, IL.
&lt;/ref&gt;, groups together organisms based on whether or not they share derived characters or character states that are assumed to be descended from a common ancestor. Transformed cladists maintain that the assumption of [[common descent]] is uninformative and/or potentially misleading, and that therefore cladistic methods should be free from evolutionary process assumptions, and based only on [[Occam's razor|parsimonious]] interpretation of empirical data: 

{{Quote|"If classifications (that is, our knowledge of patterns) are ever to provide an adequate test of theories of evolutionary processes their construction must be independent of any particular theory of process." (Platnick, 1979)&lt;ref&gt;Platnick, N. I. (1979). "Philosophy and the transformation of cladistics". ''Systematic Zoology''. 28: 537â546.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, pattern cladists argue that the fewer evolutionary assumptions a classification presupposes, the fewer errors creep in, and greater transparency results. They draw a distinction between patterns, which are observed, and processes, which may be inferred from patterns, but which should not be presupposed. Before the emergence of cladistics as a school, [[Joseph Henry Woodger]] criticized phylogenetic systematics on the grounds that homology by way of common ancestry is "putting the cart before the horse, because descent from a common ancestor is something assumed, not observed. It belongs to theory, whereas morphological correspondence is observed." &lt;ref&gt;Woodger, S. (1945). âOn Biological Transformationsâ. In: ''Essays on Growth and Form''. Le Gros Clark, W. E., Medawar, P. B (eds.). Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Colin Patterson (biologist)|Colin Patterson]] later wrote similarly:

{{Quote|"We must remember the distinction between the cart--the explanation--and the horse--the data. And where models are introduced in phylogenetic reconstruction, we should prefer models dictated by features of the data to models derived from explanatory theories." &lt;ref&gt;Patterson, C. (1994). "Null or minimal models". In: ''Models In Phylogeny Reconstruction''. Scotland, R. W. , Siebert, D. J. (eds.). Systematics Association Special Volume; 173-192.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pattern cladists, like traditional cladists, think that classifications should be isomorphic to cladograms, recognizing groups based on nested patterns of [[synapomorphy|synapomorphies]], but they argue that the discovery of characters is not dependent on apriori considerations about common ancestry:

{{Quote|"[T]o state a cladogram is a synapomorphy scheme invites the rejoinder that a cladogram must, therefore be a phyletic concept. Not so, for by âsynapomorphyâ we mean âdefining characterâ of an inclusive taxon." &lt;ref&gt;Nelson, G. J., Platnick, N. I. (1981). ''Systematics and biogeography: cladistics and vicariance'' (Vol. 214). New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nelson &amp; Platnick (1981) also noted that: "''all'' of Hennigâs groups correspond by definition to patterns of synapomorphy. Indeed, Hennigâs trees are frequently called synapomorphy schemes. The concept of âpatterns within patternsâ seems, therefore, an empirical generalization.â Pattern cladists hence regard synapomorphies to be patterns free of processes.

==Criticism==
A frequent (but false) accusation against pattern cladistics is that its proponents claim that systematics should be "theory free."  At some point in the 1960s and '70s [[Phenetics|pheneticists]] may have believed that, but pattern cladists are not pheneticists.  Obviously, rejecting a priori evolutionary process theories is not the same thing as categorically rejecting "theory" in toto.  Furthermore, pattern cladists do not reject post hoc evolutionary explanations for cladograms, they simply think that the evidence is independent of the explanation &lt;ref&gt;Brady, R. H. (1985). "On the independence of systematics". ''Cladistics''. 1: 113-126.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Nevertheless, some philosophers with a background conciliatory towards [[evolutionary taxonomy]] continue to offer criticisms in this vein:
{{Quote|"Pattern cladistics has remained on the fringe because of, first, its implausible assumption that there can be pure observation untainted by theory; and second, its rejection of the evolution assumption. Few systematists now think that a classification not based on evolutionary branching and history has any real signification or justification. The developing consensus is that Darwin was right â a natural classification must be genealogical."&lt;ref&gt;Ruse, M. (2008). ''The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Biology''. Oxford University Press. 171-172.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Of course, the distinction between the phenomenon and its explanation was clear to Darwin:  "the grand fact in natural history of the subordination of group under group, which from its familiarity, does not always sufficiently strike us, is in my judgment fully explained." &lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1859. On the Origin of Species. John Murray, London, p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brady &lt;ref&gt;Brady, R. H. (1982). "Theoretical Issues and 'Pattern Cladistics'". ''Systematic Zoology''. 3. 286-291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brady, R. H. (1985). "On the independence of systematics". ''Cladistics''. 1: 113-126.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the terms ''explanandum'' for empirical patterns (the phenomenon to be explained) and ''explanans'' for process theory (the explanation), writing: "by making our explanation into the definition of the condition [data] to be explained, we express not scientific hypothesis but belief".  In the above quote, Darwin's "fact" is the ''explanandum''; his theory of descent with modification is the ''explanans''.

In this view, whatever the characters imply as the preferred hypothesis of relationships becomes, de facto, "genealogical" when we explain it as a result of evolution. &lt;ref&gt;Brower, A. V. Z. 2002. Cladistics, phylogeny, evidence and explanation - a reply to Lee. Zool. Scripta 31:221-223.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creationist distortion==

As noted, transformed cladistics does not deny [[common ancestry]], rather it argues a logical precedence: theories regarding processes should only be formulated after patterns are discovered.  Creationists have distorted this to argue that there are pattern cladists who are skeptical about whether evolution occurs. 

===Colin Patterson===

In November, 1981, [[Colin Patterson (biologist)|Patterson]] delivered a seminar to the Systematics Discussion Group in the American Museum of Natural History&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, C. 2002. Systematics and creationism. The Linnean 18:13-37.
&lt;/ref&gt;. In the talk, Patterson asked provocatively: "Can you tell me anything about evolution, any one thing that is true?", and remarked:

{{Quote|"As I understand it, cladistics is theoretically neutral so far as evolution is concerned. It has nothing to say about evolution. You donât need to know about evolution, or believe in it, to do cladistic analysis. All that cladistics demands is that groups have characters."}}

A [[creationist]] in the audience taped segments of Patterson's talk to imply he was "agnostic" on the subject of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/rncse/20/3/evolution Colin Patterson: Evolution, Reports of the National Center for Science Education]&lt;/ref&gt; To his dismay, Patterson soon found his name quoted in creationist publications:

{{Quote|"I was too naive and foolish to guess what might happen: the talk was taped by a creationist who passed the tape to Luther Sunderland [...] Since, in my view, the tape was obtained unethically, I asked Sunderland to stop circulating the transcipt, but of course to no effect.  There is not much point in my going through the article point by point. I was putting a case for discussion, as I thought off the record, and was speaking only about systematics, a specialized field. I do not support the creationist movement in any way, and in particular I am opposed to their efforts to modify school curricula. In short the article does not fairly represent my views.  But even if it did, so what?  The issue should be resolved by rational discussion, and not by quoting 'authorities,' which seems to be the creationists' principal mode of argument."  (Letter from Colin Patterson to Steven W. Binkley, June 17, 1982)}}

{{Quote|"Unfortunately, and unknown to me, there was a creationist in my audience with a hidden tape recorder. A transcript of my talk was produced and circulated among creationists, and the talk has since been widely, and often inaccurately, quoted in creationist literature." (Patterson, 1994)}}  (Note that a transcript of Patterson's talk has been published in the Linnean 18(2),and may be [https://www.linnean.org/our-publications/the-linnean/the-linnean-back-issues-2001-2010 downloaded] from the Linnean Society).

{{Quote|text="Because creationists lack scientific research to support such theories as a young earth ... a world-wide flood ... or separate ancestry for humans and apes, their common tactic is to attack evolution by hunting out debate or dissent among evolutionary biologists. ... I learned that one should think carefully about candour in argument (in publications, lectures, or correspondence) in case one was furnishing creationist campaigners with ammunition in the form of 'quotable quotes', often taken out of context."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bartelt |first=Karen |date=MayâJune 2000 |title=Review: Evolution |url=http://ncse.com/rncse/20/3/evolution |journal=Reports of the National Center for Science Education |type=Book review |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=38â39 |issn=2158-818X |accessdate=2015-05-21}} Bartelt quoting from Patterson, ''Evolution'' (1999), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;}}

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(Y) = a[\operatorname{E}(Y)]^p,&lt;/math&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

The Tweedie distributions include a number of familiar distributions as well as some unusual ones, each being specified by the [[Domain (mathematical analysis)|domain]] of the index parameter.  We have the 
 
*[[normal distribution]], ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,
*[[Poisson distribution]], ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,
*[[Compound Poisson distribution|compound Poissonâgamma distribution]], 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2,

*[[inverse Gaussian distribution]], ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3,
*positive stable distributions, ''p''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;3, and
*extreme stable distributions, ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{math|&lt;VAR&gt;&amp;infin;&lt;/VAR&gt;}}.

For 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 no Tweedie model exists.

==Definitions==

Tweedie distributions are a special case of [[exponential dispersion model]]s, a class of models used to describe error distributions for the [[generalized linear model]].&lt;ref 
name="JÃ¸rgensen-1997"&gt;{{cite book
      | author = JÃ¸rgensen, Bent 
      | year = 1997
      | title = The theory of dispersion models
      | publisher = Chapman &amp; Hall
      | isbn = 978-0412997112
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "exponential dispersion model" refers to the [[Exponential family|exponential form]] that these models take, evident from the canonical equation used to describe the distribution ''P&lt;sub&gt;Î»,Î¸&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the random variable ''Z'' on the [[Measure (mathematics)|measurable sets]] ''A'',

: &lt;math&gt;P_{\lambda,\theta}(Z\in A)=\int_{A} \exp[\theta \cdot z-\lambda\kappa(\theta)]\cdot \nu_\lambda\, (dz),&lt;/math&gt;

with the interrelated [[Measure (mathematics)|measures]] ''Î½&lt;sub&gt;Î»&lt;/sub&gt;''.  ''Î¸'' is the [[Exponential family|canonical parameter]]; the cumulant function is

: &lt;math&gt;\kappa(\theta)=\lambda^{-1}\log\int e^{\theta z}\cdot \nu_\lambda\, (dz);&lt;/math&gt;

''Î»'' is the index parameter; and ''z'' the canonical statistic.  This equation represents a family of exponential dispersion models ED&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''Î¸'',''Î»'') that are completely determined by the parameters ''Î¸'' and ''Î»'' and the cumulant function.

===Additive exponential dispersion models===

The models just described are additive models with the property that the distribution of the sum of independent random variables,

: &lt;math&gt;Z_+ = Z_1 +\cdots+ Z_n,&lt;/math&gt;

for which ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;ED&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''Î¸'',''Î»''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) with fixed ''Î¸'' and various ''Î»'' are members of the family of distributions with the same ''Î¸'',

: &lt;math&gt;Z_+ \sim ED^*(\theta,\lambda_1+\cdots+\lambda_n).&lt;/math&gt;

===Reproductive exponential dispersion models===

A second class of exponential dispersion models exists designated by the random variable

: &lt;math&gt;Y=Z/\lambda \sim ED(\mu,\sigma^2),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Ï''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''Î»'', known as reproductive exponential dispersion models.  They have the property that for ''n'' independent random variables ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;ED(''Î¼'',''Ï''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''w''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;), with weighting factors ''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and

: &lt;math&gt;w= \sum_{i=1}^n w_i,&lt;/math&gt;

a weighted average of the variables gives,

: &lt;math&gt;w^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n w_iY_i \sim ED(\mu,\sigma^2/w).&lt;/math&gt;

For reproductive models the weighted average of independent random variables with fixed ''Î¼'' and ''Ï''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and various values for ''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a member of the family of distributions with same ''Î¼'' and ''Ï''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The Tweedie exponential dispersion models are both additive and reproductive; we thus have the ''duality transformation''

: &lt;math&gt;Y \mapsto Z=Y/\sigma^2.&lt;/math&gt;

===Scale invariance===

A third property of the Tweedie models is that they are [[Scale invariance|scale invariant]]:  For a reproductive exponential dispersion model ED(''Î¼'',''Ï''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and any positive constant ''c'' we have the property of closure under scale transformation,

: &lt;math&gt;c ED(\mu,\sigma^2)=ED(c\mu,c^{2-p}\sigma^2),&lt;/math&gt;

where the index parameter ''p'' is a real-valued unitless constant. With this transformation the new variable ''Yâ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''cY'' belongs to the family of distributions with fixed ''Î¼'' and ''Ï''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; but different values of ''c''.

===The Tweedie power variance function===

To define the [[variance function]] for exponential dispersion models we make use of the mean value mapping, the relationship between the canonical parameter ''Î¸'' and the mean ''Î¼''.  It is defined by the function

: &lt;math&gt;\tau(\theta)=\kappa^\prime(\theta)=\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Natural exponential family|variance function]] ''V''(''Î¼'') is constructed from the mean value mapping,

: &lt;math&gt;V(\mu)=\tau^\prime[\tau^{-1}(\mu)].&lt;/math&gt;

Here the minus exponent in ''Ï''&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt;(''Î¼'') denotes an inverse function rather than a reciprocal.  The mean and variance of an additive random variable is then E(''Z'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Î»Î¼'' and var(''Z'')=Î»V(''Î¼'').

Scale invariance implies that the variance function obeys the relationship 
''V''(''Î¼'') = ''Î¼''&lt;sup&gt; ''p''&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref 
name="JÃ¸rgensen-1997" /&gt;

===The Tweedie cumulant generating functions===
The properties of exponential dispersion models give us two [[differential equation]]s.&lt;ref 
name="JÃ¸rgensen-1997" /&gt;  The first relates the mean value mapping and the variance function to each other,

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \tau^{-1}(\mu)}{\partial \mu}= \frac{1}{V(\mu)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The second shows how the mean value mapping is related to the [[cumulant|cumulant function]],

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \kappa(\theta)}{\partial \theta}=\tau(\theta).&lt;/math&gt;

These equations can be solved to obtain the cumulant function for different cases of the Tweedie models.  A cumulant generating function (CGF) may then be obtained from the cumulant function.  The additive CGF is generally specified by the equation

: &lt;math&gt;K^*(s)=\log[\text{E}(e^{sZ})]=\lambda[\kappa(\theta+s)-\kappa(\theta)],&lt;/math&gt;

and the reproductive CGF by

: &lt;math&gt;K(s)=\log[\text{E}(e^{sY})]=\lambda[\kappa(\theta+s/\lambda)-\kappa(\theta)],&lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' is the generating function variable.

The cumulant functions for specific values of the index parameter ''p'' are&lt;ref 
name="JÃ¸rgensen-1997" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\kappa_p(\theta) = \begin{cases} \dfrac{\alpha-1}{\alpha} \left(\dfrac{\theta}{\alpha-1}\right)^\alpha
&amp; \quad p \ne 1,2, \\ -\log(-\theta)  &amp; \quad p = 2, \\ e^\theta &amp; \quad p = 1, \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Î±'' is the Tweedie exponent

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\dfrac{p-2}{p-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

For the additive Tweedie models the CGFs take the form,

: &lt;math&gt;K^*_p(s;\theta,\lambda) = \begin{cases} \lambda\kappa_p(\theta)[(1+s/\theta)^\alpha-1]
 &amp; \quad p \ne 1,2, \\ -\lambda \log(1+s/\theta) &amp;  \quad p = 2,  \\ \lambda e^\theta (e^s -1) &amp; \quad p = 1, \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

and for the reproductive models,

: &lt;math&gt;K_p(s;\theta,\lambda) = \begin{cases} \lambda\kappa_p(\theta)\left \{ [1+s/(\theta \lambda)]^\alpha-1 \right \}
&amp; \quad p \ne 1,2, \\ -\lambda \log[1+s/(\theta \lambda)]  &amp; \quad p = 2,  \\ \lambda e^\theta (e^{s/\lambda} -1) &amp; \quad p = 1. \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The additive and reproductive Tweedie models are conventionally denoted by the symbols ''Tw''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Î¸'',''Î»'') and ''Tw''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Î¸'',''Ï''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively.

The first and second derivatives of the CGFs, with ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, yields the mean and variance, respectively.  One can thus confirm that for the additive models the variance relates to the mean by the power law,

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{var} (Z)\propto \mathrm{E}(Z)^p.&lt;/math&gt;

==The Tweedie convergence theorem==

The Tweedie exponential dispersion models are fundamental in statistical theory consequent to their roles as foci of [[convergence in distribution|convergence]] for a wide range of statistical processes.  JÃ¸rgensen ''et al'' proved a theorem that specifies the asymptotic behaviour of variance functions known as the Tweedie convergence theorem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=JÃ¸rgensen, B |author2=Martinez, JR |author3=Tsao, M|title=Asymptotic behaviour of the variance function|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Statistics|year=1994|volume=21|pages=223â243}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theorem, in technical terms, is stated thus:&lt;ref 
name="JÃ¸rgensen-1997" /&gt; The unit variance function is regular of order ''p'' at zero (or infinity) provided that ''V''(''Î¼'')&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''Î¼''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; for ''Î¼'' as it approaches zero (or infinity) for all real values of ''p'' and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.  Then for a unit variance function regular of order ''p'' at either zero or infinity and for

: &lt;math&gt;p \notin (0,1),&lt;/math&gt;

for any &lt;math&gt;\mu&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \sigma^2&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; we have

: &lt;math&gt;c^{-1} ED(c\mu,\sigma^2c^{2-p}) \rightarrow Tw_p(\mu,c_0 \sigma^2)&lt;/math&gt;

as &lt;math&gt;c \downarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;c \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, where the convergence is through values of ''c'' such that ''cÎ¼'' is in the domain of ''Î¸'' and ''c''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''Ï''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is in the domain of ''Î»''.   The model must be infinitely divisible as ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; approaches infinity.&lt;ref 
name="JÃ¸rgensen-1997" /&gt;

In nontechnical terms this theorem implies that any exponential dispersion model that asymptotically manifests a variance-to-mean power law is required to have a variance function that comes within the [[Attractor|domain of attraction]] of a Tweedie model.  Almost all distribution functions with finite cumulant generating functions qualify as exponential dispersion models and most exponential dispersion models manifest variance functions of this form.  Hence many probability distributions have variance functions that express this asymptotic behavior, and  the Tweedie distributions become foci of convergence for a wide range of data types.&lt;ref name=Kendal2011b&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = W.

==The Tweedie models and Taylorâs power law==

[[Taylor's law]] is an empirical law in [[ecology]] that relates the variance of the number of individuals of a species per unit area of habitat to the corresponding mean by a [[power-law]] relationship.&lt;ref name=Taylor1961&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = LR | year = 1961 | title = Aggregation, variance and the mean | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 189 | issue = | pages = 732â735 | doi=10.1038/189732a0| bibcode = 1961Natur.189..732T}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the population count ''Y'' with mean ''Âµ'' and variance var(''Y''), Taylorâs law is written,

: &lt;math&gt;\text{var}\,(Y) = a\mu^p,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''p'' are both positive constants.   Since L. R. Taylor described this law in 1961 there have been many different explanations offered to explain it, ranging from animal behavior,&lt;ref name="Taylor1961" /&gt; a [[random walk]] model,&lt;ref name=Hanski1980&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hanski | first1 = I | year = 1980 | title = Spatial patterns and movements in coprophagous beetles | url = | journal = Oikos | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 293â310 | doi=10.2307/3544289}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[birth-death process|stochastic birth, death, immigration and emigration model]],&lt;ref name=Anderson1961&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = RD | last2 = Crawley | first2 = GM | last3 = Hassell | first3 = M | year = 1982 | title = Variability in the abundance of animal and plant species | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 296 | issue = | pages = 245â248 | doi=10.1038/296245a0| bibcode = 1982Natur.296..245A }}&lt;/ref&gt; to a consequence of equilibrium and non-equilibrium [[statistical mechanics]].&lt;ref name=Fronczak2010&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fronczak | first1 = A | last2 = Fronczak | first2 = P | year = 2010 | title = Origins of Taylor's power law for fluctuation scaling in complex systems | url = | journal = Phys Rev E | volume = 81 | issue = | page = 066112 | doi=10.1103/physreve.81.066112| arxiv = 0909.1896 | bibcode = 2010PhRvE..81f6112F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  No consensus exists as to an explanation for this model.

Since Taylorâs law is mathematically identical to the variance-to-mean power law that characterizes the Tweedie models, it seemed reasonable to use these models and the Tweedie convergence theorem to explain the observed clustering of animals and plants associated with Taylorâs law.&lt;ref name=Kendal2002&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = WS | year = 2002 | title = Spatial aggregation of the Colorado potato beetle described by an exponential dispersion model | url = | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 151 | issue = | pages = 261â269 | doi=10.1016/s0304-3800(01)00494-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kendal2004&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = WS | year = 2004 | title = Taylor's ecological power law as a consequence of scale invariant exponential dispersion models | url = | journal = Ecol Complex | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 193â209 | doi=10.1016/j.ecocom.2004.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority of the observed values for the power-law exponent ''p'' have fallen in the interval (1,2) and so the Tweedie compound Poissonâgamma distribution would seem applicable.  Comparison of the [[empirical distribution function]] to the theoretical compound Poissonâgamma distribution has provided a means to verify consistency of this hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Kendal2002" /&gt;

Whereas conventional models for Taylorâs law have tended to involve ''[[ad hoc]]'' animal behavioral or [[population dynamics|population dynamic]] assumptions, the Tweedie convergence theorem would imply that Taylorâs law results from a general mathematical convergence effect much as how the [[central limit theorem]] governs the convergence behavior of certain types of random data.  Indeed, any mathematical model, approximation or simulation that is designed to yield Taylorâs law (on the basis of this theorem) is required to converge to the form of the Tweedie models.&lt;ref name=Kendal2011b /&gt;

==Tweedie convergence and 1/''f'' noise==

[[Pink noise]], or 1/''f'' noise, refers to a pattern of noise characterized by a power-law relationship between its intensities ''S''(''f'') at different frequencies ''f'',

: &lt;math&gt;S(f)\propto 1/f^{ \gamma},&lt;/math&gt;

where the dimensionless exponent ''Î³'' â [0,1].  It is found within a diverse number of natural processes.&lt;ref name=Dutta1981&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dutta | first1 = P | last2 = Horn | first2 = PM | year = 1981 | title = Low frequency fluctuations in solids: 1/''f'' noise | url = | journal = Rev Mod Phys | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 497â516 | doi=10.1103/revmodphys.53.497 | bibcode=1981RvMP...53..497D}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many different explanations for 1/''f'' noise exist, a widely held hypothesis is based on [[Self-organized criticality]] where dynamical systems close to a [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] are thought to manifest [[scale-invariance|scale-invariant]] spatial and/or temporal behavior.

In this subsection a mathematical connection between 1/''f'' noise and the Tweedie variance-to-mean power law will be described.  To begin, we first need to introduce [[self-similar process]]es:  For the sequence of numbers

: &lt;math&gt;Y=(Y_i :i=0,1,2,\ldots,N)&lt;/math&gt;

with mean

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu}=\text{E}(Y_i),&lt;/math&gt;

deviations

: &lt;math&gt;y_i = Y_i - \hat{\mu}, &lt;/math&gt;

variance

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{\sigma}^2=\text{E}(y_i^2),&lt;/math&gt;
 
and autocorrelation function

: &lt;math&gt;r(k)=\text{E}(y_i,y_{i+k})/\text{E}(y_i^2)&lt;/math&gt;

with lag ''k'', if the [[autocorrelation]] of this sequence has the long range behavior

: &lt;math&gt;r(k)\sim k^{-d} L(k) &lt;/math&gt;

as ''k''{{math|&lt;VAR&gt;&amp;rarr;&amp;infin;&lt;/VAR&gt;}} and where ''L''(''k'') is a slowly varying function at large values of ''k'', this sequence is called a self-similar process.&lt;ref name=Leland1994&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leland | first1 = WE | last2 = Taqqu | first2 = MS | last3 = Willinger | first3 = W | last4 = Wilson | first4 = DV | year = 1994 | title = On the self-similar nature of ethernet traffic | url = | journal = IEE/ACM Trans Networking | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 1â15 | doi=10.1109/90.282603}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''method of expanding bins''' can be used to analyze self-similar processes.  Consider a set of equal-sized non-overlapping bins that divides the original sequence of ''N'' elements into groups of ''m'' equal-sized segments (''N/m'' is integer) so that new reproductive sequences, based on the mean values, can be defined:

: &lt;math&gt;Y_i^{(m)}=(Y_{im-m+1}+\cdots+Y_{im})/m.&lt;/math&gt;

The variance determined from this sequence will scale as the bin size changes such that

: &lt;math&gt;\text{var}[Y^{(m)}]=\hat{\sigma}^2 m^{-d}&lt;/math&gt;
 
if and only if the autocorrelation has the limiting form&lt;ref name=Tsybakov1997&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tsybakov | first1 = B | last2 = Georganas | first2 = ND | year = 1997 | title = On self-similar traffic in ATM queues: definitions, overflow probability bound, and cell delay distribution | url = | journal = IEEE/ACM Trans Networking | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 397â409 | doi=10.1109/90.611104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{k \to \infty}r(k)/k^{-d} = (2-d)(1-d)/2.&lt;/math&gt;

One can also construct a set of corresponding additive sequences

: &lt;math&gt;Z_i^{(m)} = mY_i^{(m)},&lt;/math&gt;

based on the expanding bins,

: &lt;math&gt;Z_i^{(m)}=(Y_{im-m+1}+\cdots+Y_{im}).&lt;/math&gt;

Provided the autocorrelation function exhibits the same behavior, the additive sequences will obey the relationship

: &lt;math&gt;\text{var}[Z_i^{(m)}]=m^2 \text{var}[Y^{(m)}]=(\hat{\sigma}^2 /\hat{\mu}^{2-d})\text{E}[Z_i^{(m)}]^{2-d}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\sigma}^2&lt;/math&gt; are constants this relationship constitutes a variance-to-mean power law, with ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;''d''.&lt;ref name="Kendal2011b" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kendal2007&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = WS | year = 2007 | title = Scale invariant correlations between genes and SNPs on Human chromosome 1 reveal potential evolutionary mechanisms | url = | journal = J Theor Biol | volume = 245 | issue = | pages = 329â340 | doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.10.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Logical biconditional|biconditional]] relationship above between the variance-to-mean power law and power law autocorrelation function, and the [[WienerâKhinchin theorem]]&lt;ref name=McQuarrie1976&gt;McQuarrie DA (1976) ''Statistical mechanics'' [Harper &amp; Row]&lt;/ref&gt; imply that any sequence that exhibits a variance-to-mean power law by the method of expanding bins will also manifest 1/''f'' noise, and vice versa.  Moreover, the Tweedie convergence theorem, by virtue of its central limit-like effect of generating distributions that manifest variance-to-mean power functions, will also generate processes that manifest 1/''f'' noise.&lt;ref name="Kendal2011b" /&gt;  The Tweedie convergence theorem thus provides an alternative explanation for the origin of 1/''f'' noise, based its central limit-like effect.

Much as the [[central limit theorem]] requires certain kinds of random processes to have as a focus of their convergence the [[normal distribution|Gaussian distribution]] and thus express [[white noise]], the Tweedie convergence theorem requires certain non-Gaussian processes to have as a focus of convergence the Tweedie distributions that express 1/''f'' noise.&lt;ref name="Kendal2011b" /&gt;

==The Tweedie models and multifractality==

From the properties of self-similar processes, the power-law exponent ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;''d'' is related to the [[Hurst exponent]] ''H'' and the [[fractal dimension]] ''D'' by&lt;ref name="Tsybakov1997" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;D = 2-H = 2 - p/2. &lt;/math&gt;

A one-dimensional data sequence of self-similar data may demonstrate a variance-to-mean power law with local variations in the value of ''p'' and hence in the value of ''D''.  When fractal structures manifest local variations in fractal dimension, they are said to be  [[multifractal system|multifractals]].  Examples of data sequences that exhibit local variations in ''p'' like this include the eigenvalue deviations of the [[Random matrix|Gaussian Orthogonal and Unitary Ensembles]].&lt;ref name="Kendal2011b" /&gt;  The Tweedie compound Poissonâgamma distribution has served to model multifractality based on local variations in the Tweedie exponent ''Î±''.  Consequently, in conjunction with the variation of ''Î±'', the Tweedie convergence theorem can be viewed as having a role in the genesis of such multifractals.

The variation of ''Î±'' has been found to obey the asymmetric [[Laplace distribution]] in certain cases.&lt;ref name=Kendal2014&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = WS | year = 2014 | title = Multifractality attributed to dual central limit-lie convergence effects | url = | journal = Physica A | volume = 401 | issue = | pages = 22â33 | doi=10.1016/j.physa.2014.01.022| bibcode = 2014PhyA..401...22K}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This distribution has been shown to be a member of the family of geometric Tweedie models,&lt;ref name="JÃ¸rgensen2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = JÃ¸rgensen | first1 = B | last2 = Kokonendji | first2 = CC | year = 2011 | title = Dispersion models for geometric sums | url = | journal = Braz J Probab Stat | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 263â293 | doi=10.1214/10-bjps136}}&lt;/ref&gt; that manifest as limiting distributions in a convergence theorem for geometric dispersion models.

==Applications==

===Regional organ blood flow===

Regional organ blood flow has been traditionally assessed by the injection of [[Isotopic labeling|radiolabelled]] [[polyethylene microspheres]] into the arterial circulation of animals, of a size that they become entrapped within the [[microcirculation]] of organs.  The organ to be assessed is then divided into equal-sized cubes and the amount of radiolabel within each cube is evaluated by [[liquid scintillation counting]] and recorded. The amount of radioactivity within each cube is taken to reflect the blood flow through that sample at the time of injection.  It is possible to evaluate adjacent cubes from an organ in order to additively determine the blood flow through larger regions.  Through the work of '''J B Bassingthwaighte''' and others an empirical power law has been derived between the relative dispersion of blood flow of tissue samples (''RD''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;standard&amp;nbsp;deviation/mean) of mass ''m'' relative to reference-sized samples:&lt;ref name=Bassingthwaighte1989&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bassingthwaighte | first1 = JB | year = 1989 | title = Fractal nature of regional myocardial blood flow heterogeneity | url = | journal = Circ Res | volume = 65 | issue = | pages = 578â590 | doi=10.1161/01.res.65.3.578| pmc = 3361973 | pmid=2766485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;RD(m)=RD(m_\text{ref})\left (\frac{m}{m_\text{ref}}\right )^{1-D_s}&lt;/math&gt;

This power law exponent ''D&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' has been called a fractal dimension.  '''Bassingthwaighteâs power law''' can be shown to directly relate to the variance-to-mean power law.  Regional organ blood flow can thus be modelled by the Tweedie compound Poissonâgamma distribution.,&lt;ref name=Kendal2001&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = WS | year = 2001 | title = A stochastic model for the self-similar heterogeneity of regional organ blood flow | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 98 | issue = | pages = 837â841 | doi=10.1073/pnas.98.3.837| pmc = 14670| bibcode = 2001PNAS...98..837K}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this model tissue sample could be considered to contain a random (Poisson) distributed number of entrapment sites, each with [[gamma distribution|gamma distributed]] blood flow.  Blood flow at this microcirculatory level has been observed to obey a gamma distribution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Honig | first1 = CR | last2 = Feldstein | first2 = ML | last3 = Frierson | first3 = JL | year = 1977 | title = Capillary lengths, anastomoses, and estimated capillary transit times in skeletal muscle | url = | journal = Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol | volume = 233 | issue = | pages = H122âH129 | doi=10.1152/ajpheart.1977.233.1.h122}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus providing support for this hypothesis.

===Cancer metastasis===

The "experimental cancer [[metastasis]] assay"&lt;ref name=Fidler1977&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fidler|first=IJ|author2=Kripke, M |title=Metastasis results from preexisting variant cells within a malignant tumor|journal=Science|year=1977|volume=197|pages=893â895|bibcode = 1977Sci...197..893F |doi = 10.1126/science.887927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  has some resemblance to the above method to measure regional blood flow.  Groups of [[syngeneic]] and age matched mice are given intravenous injections of equal-sized aliquots of suspensions of cloned cancer cells and then after a set period of time their lungs are removed and the number of cancer metastases enumerated within each pair of lungs.  If other groups of mice are injected with different cancer cell [[Clone (cell biology)|clones]] then the number of metastases per group will differ in accordance with the metastatic potentials of the clones.  It has been long recognized that there can be considerable intraclonal variation in the numbers of metastases per mouse despite the best attempts to keep the experimental conditions within each clonal group uniform.&lt;ref name=Fidler1977 /&gt; This variation is larger than would be expected on the basis of a [[Poisson distribution]] of numbers of metastases per mouse in each clone and when the variance of the number of metastases per mouse was plotted against the corresponding mean a power law was found.&lt;ref name=Kendal1987&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = WS | last2 = Frost | first2 = P | year = 1987 | title = Experimental metastasis: a novel application of the variance-to-mean power function | doi = 10.1093/jnci/79.5.1113 | journal = J Natl Cancer Inst | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 1113â1115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The variance-to-mean power law for metastases was found to also hold for '''spontaneous murine metastases'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = WS | year = 1999 | title = Clustering of murine lung metastases reflects fractal nonuniformity in regional lung blood flow | url = | journal = Invasion Metastasis | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 285â296 | doi=10.1159/000024521}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and for cases series of human metastases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = WS | last2 = Lagerwaard | first2 = FJ | last3 = Agboola | first3 = O | year = 2000 | title = Characterization of the frequency distribution for human hematogenous metastases: evidence for clustering and a power variance function | url = | journal = Clin Exp Metastasis | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 219â229 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since hematogenous metastasis occurs in direct relationship to regional blood flow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weiss | first1 = L | last2 = Bronk | first2 = J | last3 = Pickren | first3 = JW | last4 = Lane | first4 = WW | year = 1981 | title = Metastatic patterns and targe organ arterial blood flow | url = | journal = Invasion Metastasis | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 126â135 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and videomicroscopic studies indicate that the passage and entrapment of cancer cells within the circulation appears analogous to the microsphere experiments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chambers | first1 = AF | last2 = Groom | first2 = AC | last3 = MacDonald | first3 = IC | year = 2002 | title = Dissemination and growth of cancer cells in metastatic sites | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Cancer | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 563â572 | doi=10.1038/nrc865}}&lt;/ref&gt; it seemed plausible to propose that the variation in numbers of hematogenous metastases could reflect heterogeneity in regional organ blood flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = WS | year = 2002 | title = A frequency distribution for the number of hematogenous organ metastases | url = | journal = Invasion Metastasis | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 126â135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The blood flow model was based on the Tweedie compound Poissonâgamma distribution, a distribution governing a continuous random variable.  For that reason in the metastasis model it was assumed that blood flow was governed by that distribution and that the number of regional metastases occurred as a [[Poisson process]] for which the intensity was directly proportional to blood flow.  This led to the description of the Poisson negative binomial (PNB) distribution as a [[discrete probability distribution|discrete equivalent]] to the Tweedie compound Poissonâgamma distribution.  The [[probability-generating function|probability generating function]] for the PNB distribution is

: &lt;math&gt;G(s)= \exp \left [\lambda \frac {\alpha-1}{\alpha} \left( \frac{\theta} {\alpha-1} \right)^\alpha \left\{ \left(1- \frac{1} {\theta}+ \frac {s} {\theta}\right)^\alpha-1 \right\}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship between the mean and variance of the PNB distribution is then

: &lt;math&gt;\text{var}\,(Y) = a\text{E}(Y)^b + \text{E}(Y),&lt;/math&gt;

which, in the range of many experimental metastasis assays, would be indistinguishable from the variance-to-mean power law.  For sparse data, however, this discrete variance-to-mean relationship would behave more like that of a Poisson distribution where the variance equaled the mean.

===Genomic structure and evolution===

The local density of [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms]] (SNPs) within the [[human genome]], as well as that of [[gene]]s, appears to cluster in accord with the variance-to-mean power law and the Tweedie compound Poissonâgamma distribution.&lt;ref name=Kendal2003&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = WS | year = 2003 | title = An exponential dispersion model for the  distribution of human single nucleotide polymorphisms | url = | journal = Mol Biol Evol | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 579â590 | doi=10.1093/molbev/msg057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KendalGenes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kendal|first=WS|title=A scale invariant clustering of genes on human chromosome 7|journal=BMC Evol Biol|year=2004|volume=4|pages=3|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-4-3|pmid=15040817|pmc=373443}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of SNPs their observed density reflects the assessment techniques, the availability of genomic sequences for analysis, and the [[Nucleotide diversity|nucleotide heterozygosity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2001 | title = A map of human genome variation containing 1.42 million single nucleotide polymorphisms | doi = 10.1038/35057149 | journal = Nature | volume = 409 | issue = | pages = 928â933 | pmid=11237013 | last1 = Sachidanandam | first1 = R | last2 = Weissman | first2 = D | last3 = Schmidt | first3 = SC | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first two factors reflect ascertainment errors inherent to the collection methods, the latter factor reflects an intrinsic property of the genome.

In the [[Coalescent theory|coalescent model]] of population genetics each genetic locus has its own unique history.  Within the evolution of a population from some species some genetic loci could presumably be traced back to a relatively [[Most recent common ancestor|recent common ancestor]] whereas other loci might have more ancient [[Genetic genealogy|genealogies]].  More ancient genomic segments would have had more time to accumulate SNPs and to experience [[Genetic recombination|recombination]].  '''R R Hudson''' has proposed a model where recombination could cause variation in the time to [[Most recent common ancestor|most common recent ancestor]] for different genomic segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hudson | first1 = RR | year = 1991 | title = Gene genealogies and the coalescent process | url = | journal = Oxford Surveys in Evolutionary Biology | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 1â44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A high recombination rate could cause a chromosome to contain a large number of small segments with less correlated genealogies.

Assuming a constant background rate of mutation the number of SNPs per genomic segment would accumulate proportionately to the time to the most recent common ancestor.  Current [[population genetics|population genetic theory]] would indicate that these times would be [[gamma distribution|gamma distributed]], on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tavare | first1 = S | last2 = Balding | first2 = DJ | last3 = Griffiths | first3 = RC | last4 = Donnelly | first4 = P | year = 1997 | title = Inferring coalescent times from DNA sequence data | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 145 | issue = | pages = 505â518 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Tweedie compound Poissonâgamma distribution would suggest a model whereby the SNP map would consist of multiple small genomic segments with the mean number of SNPs per segment would be gamma distributed as per Hudsonâs model.

The distribution of genes within the human genome also demonstrated a variance-to-mean power law, when the method of expanding bins was used to determine the corresponding variances and means.&lt;ref name=KendalGenes /&gt; Similarly the number of genes per enumerative bin was found to obey a Tweedie compound Poissonâgamma distribution.  This probability distribution was deemed compatible with two different biological models: the '''microarrangement model''' where the number of genes per unit genomic length was determined by the sum of a random number of smaller genomic segments derived by random breakage and reconstruction of protochormosomes.  These smaller segments would be assumed to carry on average a gamma distributed number of genes.

In the alternative '''gene cluster model''', genes would be distributed randomly within the protochromosomes.  Over large evolutionary timescales there would occur [[gene duplication|tandem duplication]], [[mutation|mutations, insertions, deletions]] and [[chromosomal rearrangement|rearrangements]] that could affect the genes through a stochastic [[Birthâdeath process|birth, death and immigration process]] to yield the Tweedie compound Poissonâgamma distribution.

Both these mechanisms would implicate [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution|neutral evolutionary processes]] that would result in regional clustering of genes.

===Random matrix theory===

The '''[[Random matrix|Gaussian unitary ensemble]]''' (GUE) consists of complex [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian matrices]] that are invariant under [[unitary transformation]]s whereas the '''[[Random matrix|Gaussian orthogonal ensemble]]''' (GOE) consists of real symmetric matrices invariant under [[orthogonal transformation]]s.  The ranked [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] ''E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/SUB&gt;'' from these random matrices obey '''[[Wigner semicircle distribution|Wignerâs semicircular distribution]]''': For a ''N''&amp;times;''N'' matrix the average density for eigenvalues of size ''E'' will be

: &lt;math&gt;\bar{\rho}(E)=  \begin{cases} \sqrt{2N-E^2}/\pi
&amp; \quad \left\vert E \right\vert &lt; \sqrt{2N} \\ 0 &amp; \quad \left\vert E \right\vert &gt; \sqrt{2N} \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

as ''E''{{math|&lt;VAR&gt;&amp;rarr; &amp;infin; &lt;/VAR&gt;}}.  Integration of the semicircular rule provides the number of eigenvalues on average less than ''E'',

: &lt;math&gt;\bar{\eta}(E) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\left [E\sqrt{2N-E^2}+2N \arcsin \left( \frac{E}{\sqrt{2N}} \right )+ \pi N \right ]. &lt;/math&gt;

The ranked eigenvalues can be '''unfolded''', or renormalized, with the equation

: &lt;math&gt;e_n = \bar{\eta}(E)=\int \limits_{-\infty}^{E_n}dE^\prime \bar{\rho}(E^\prime). &lt;/math&gt;

This removes the trend of the sequence from the fluctuating portion.  If we look at the absolute value of the difference between the actual and expected cumulative number of eigenvalues

: &lt;math&gt;\left | \bar{D}_n \right | =\left |  n- \bar{\eta}(E_n) \right | &lt;/math&gt;

we obtain a sequence of '''eigenvalue fluctuations''' which, using the method of expanding bins, reveals a variance-to-mean power law.&lt;ref name="Kendal2011b" /&gt;
The eigenvalue fluctuations of both the GUE and the GOE manifest this power law with the power law exponents ranging between 1 and 2, and they similarly manifest 1/''f'' noise spectra.  These eigenvalue fluctuations also correspond to the Tweedie compound Poissonâgamma distribution and they exhibit multifractality.&lt;ref name="Kendal2011b" /&gt;

===The distribution of [[prime number]]s===

The '''second [[Chebyshev function]]''' ''&amp;psi;''(''x'') is given by,

:&lt;math&gt; \psi(x) = \sum_{\hat{p}^k\le x}\log \hat{p}=\sum_{n \leq x} \Lambda(n) &lt;/math&gt;

where the summation extends over all prime powers &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}^k &lt;/math&gt; not exceeding&amp;nbsp;''x'', ''x'' runs over the positive real numbers, and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[von Mangoldt function]]. The function ''&amp;psi;''(''x'') is related to the [[prime-counting function]] ''&amp;pi;''(''x''), and as such provides information with regards to the distribution of prime numbers amongst the real numbers.  It is asymptotic to&amp;nbsp;''x'', a statement equivalent to the [[prime number theorem]] and it can also be shown to be related to the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] located on the critical strip Ï, where the real part of the zeta zero Ï is between 0 and 1.  Then Ï expressed for ''x'' greater than one can be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_0(x) = x - \sum_\rho \frac{x^\rho}{\rho} - \ln 2\pi - \frac12 \ln(1-x^{-2})&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;\psi_0(x) = \lim_{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0}\frac{\psi(x-\varepsilon)+\psi(x+\varepsilon)}2.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Riemann hypothesis]] states that the [[root of a function|nontrivial zeros]] of the [[Riemann zeta function]] all have [[real part]] Â½.  These zeta function zeros are related to the [[prime number theorem|distribution of prime numbers]].  [[Lowell Schoenfeld|'''Schoenfeld''']]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schoenfeld|first=J|title=Sharper bounds for the Chebyshev functions Î¸(x) and Ï(x). II|journal=Math Computation|year=1976|volume=30|issue=134|pages=337â360|doi=10.1090/s0025-5718-1976-0457374-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  has shown that if the Riemann hypothesis is true then

: &lt;math&gt; \Delta(x)=\left\vert \psi(x)-x \right\vert &lt; \sqrt{x} \log^{2}(x)/(8 \pi)&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;73.2&lt;/math&gt;. If we analyze the Chebyshev deviations Î(''n'') on the integers ''n'' using the method of expanding bins and plot the variance versus the mean a variance to mean power law can be demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kendal|first=WS|title=Fluctuation scaling and 1/f noise: shared origins from the Tweedie family of statistical distributions|journal=J Basic Appl Phys|year=2013|volume=2|pages=40â49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, these deviations correspond to the Tweedie compound Poisson-gamma distribution and they exhibit 1/''f'' noise.
