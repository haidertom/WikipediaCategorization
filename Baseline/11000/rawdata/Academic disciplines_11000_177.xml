'''''A Community of Witches: Contemporary Neo-Paganism and Witchcraft in the United States''''' is a [[sociology|sociological]] study of the [[Wicca]]n and wider [[Paganism (contemporary)|Pagan]] community in the [[Northeastern United States]]. It was written by American sociologist [[Helen A. Berger]] of the [[West Chester University of Pennsylvania]] and first published in 1999 by the [[University of South Carolina Press]]. It was released as a part of a series of academic books entitled Studies in Comparative Religion, edited by Frederick M. Denny, a [[religious studies]] scholar at the [[University of Chicago]].

Berger became interested in studying the Wiccan and Pagan movement in 1986, when she presented a lecture on the subject at the [[Boston Public Library]]. Subsequently becoming acquainted with members of the New England Pagan community, she undertook fieldwork in both a local Wiccan coven, the Circle of Light, and a wider Pagan organisation, the EarthSpirit Community (ESC). In total, Berger underwent 11 years of fieldwork among the Pagan community. Along with ESC founder Andras Corban Arthen, Berger also undertook a "Pagan Census" survey of the U.S. in the mid-1990s to obtain more data on the country's Pagan community.

''A Community of Witches'' is based on interviews with more than a hundred practicing Wiccans and Pagans, study of the pre-existing literature on the subject and a national survey of the Pagan community in the U.S. In her work, Berger interprets Wicca as a religion of [[late modernity]], as opposed to [[postmodernism|postmodernity]], and subsequently examines it using the theories of sociologists [[Anthony Giddens]] and [[James A. Beckford]]. Themes covered include Pagan conceptions of the self, the role of covens and the wider Pagan community, the place of children in the movement and the increasing routinization of Wicca through the foundation of organised churches and clergy.

Academic reviewers were mostly positive, but several raised concerns over Berger's incorrect use of terminology. Reviewers noted the study's importance in developing [[Pagan studies]] as an academic discipline and helping further the wider sociological investigation into [[new religious movement]]s in the United States. In the years following the study's publication, Berger continued to investigate the Pagan community, focusing her interest on the popularity of Wicca among teenagers.

==Background==

===Paganism and Wicca in the United States===

Contemporary Paganism, also referred to as Neo-Paganism, is an [[umbrella term]] used to identify a wide variety of [[new religious movement|modern religious movements]], particularly those influenced by or claiming to be derived from the various [[Paganism|pagan]] beliefs of pre-modern Europe.&lt;ref name="Carpenter 1996 40"&gt;[[#Car96|Carpenter 1996]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew04|Lewis 2004]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The religion of Pagan Witchcraft, or [[Wicca]], was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and is one of several Pagan religions. The figure at the forefront of Wicca's early development was the English occultist [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] (1884&amp;ndash;1964), the author of ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959) and the founder of a tradition known as [[Gardnerian Wicca]]. Gardnerian Wicca revolved around the veneration of both a [[Horned God]] and a [[Mother Goddess]], the celebration of eight seasonally-based festivals in a [[Wheel of the Year]] and the practice of magical rituals in groups known as [[coven]]s. Gardnerianism was subsequently brought to the U.S. in the early 1960s by an English initiate, [[Raymond Buckland]] (1934&amp;ndash;), and his then-wife Rosemary, who together founded a coven in [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]] pp. 205&amp;ndash;252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., new variants of Wicca developed, including [[Dianic Wicca]], a tradition founded in the 1970s which was influenced by [[second-wave feminism]], emphasized female-only covens, and rejected the veneration of the Horned God. One initiate of both the Dianic and Gardnerian traditions was a woman known as [[Starhawk]] (1951&amp;ndash;) who went on to found her own tradition, [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming Wicca]]. She furthermore published ''[[The Spiral Dance|The Spiral Dance: a Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess]]'' (1979), a book which helped spread Wicca throughout the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. pp. 340&amp;ndash;351&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 122&amp;ndash;123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic fieldwork into Wicca===

Prior to Berger's work, several American researchers working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] had separately published investigations of the Pagan community in the United States and the United Kingdom. The first of these was the practicing Wiccan, journalist and political activist [[Margot Adler]] in her ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today]]'', which was first published by [[Viking Press]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl79|Adler 1979]].&lt;/ref&gt; A second study was produced by the anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] in her ''[[Persuasions of the Witch's Craft|Persuasions of the Witch's Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England]]'' (1989), in which she focused on both a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders that were then operating in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Luh89|Luhrmann 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The next academic book to be published based upon fieldwork undertaken in the U.S. Pagan community was ''[[Living Witchcraft|Living Witchcraft: A Contemporary American Coven]]'', published by Praeger in 1994. ''Living Witchcraft'' had been co-written by three academics, the sociologist Allen Scarboro, psychologist Nancy Campbell and literary critic Shirley Stave, herself a Wiccan practitioner. It was based upon their fieldwork undertaken in the Ravenwood coven of [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], over several months across 1990 and 1991.&lt;ref name="Scarboro"&gt;[[#Scar94|Scarboro, Campbell and Stave 1994]].&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time as Scarboro, Campbell and Stave were undertaking their research, the American anthropologist and practicing Wiccan Loretta Orion was also undertaking an investigation into the Pagan movement in the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] of the United States. Orion's work was published as ''[[Never Again the Burning Times|Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited]]'' by Waveland Press in 1995, although would be heavily criticized in published reviews written by both Luhrmann and T.O. Beidelman, both of whom were of the opinion that Orion's Pagan beliefs had clouded her critical interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Ori95|Orion 1995]], and also [[#Bei95|Beidelman 1995]] and [[#Luh96|Luhrmann 1996]].&lt;/ref&gt; 1997 then saw the publication of ''[[Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia]]'', authored by the anthropologist Lynne Hume.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berger and her research===

Helen Berger, then a lecturer in sociology at the [[West Chester University of Pennsylvania]], had initially become involved in the study of the Pagan movement in preparation for a series of public lectures that she gave at the [[Boston Public Library]] in October 1986. Based on the subject of [[Witch trials in the Early Modern period|the historical witch trials]] that took place in [[New England]] during the [[Early Modern period]], she devoted the final lecture in the series to an examination of the contemporary Pagan Witches, or Wiccans, then living in the area. Having yet to perform the sociological investigation that would culminate in ''A Community of Witches'', Berger gained her information for this lecture from the information published in the works of Margot Adler, Starhawk and [[Marcello Truzzi]], and also from a singular interview that she had carried out with a woman who was "peripherally associated" with Paganism. After the lecture, several audience members approached Berger to identify themselves as practicing Wiccans, and it was through them that she came into contact with the New England Pagan community.&lt;ref name="Berger 1999 xiv&amp;ndash;xv"&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. xiv&amp;ndash;xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the Wiccans at the lecture invited Berger to "participate as a researcher" as they founded their own coven, the Circle of Light, and she attended their weekly meetings and festival celebrations for the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past thirty years, Paganism has exhibited a considerable growth in membership, but, given such factors as the lack of centralized organization within the Pagan movement and the relative anonymity sought by many of its adherents, it is very difficult to estimate how many of us there are&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br&gt;'''Why is it needed?'''&lt;br&gt;There are several reasons why such a project is important. If we can document our numbers in some tangible way, we will be in a stronger position to attain more credibility as a religion and as a community. Greater credibility would enable us to better address issues of religious discrimination and social prejudice (the [[Jesse Helms|Helms Bill]], or movies such as ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'', for instance); would give us more weight in addressing anti-Pagan stereotypes&amp;nbsp;... and it would give us greater access to influential forums (such as academia, interfaith councils, etc.) from which Pagans have mostly been excluded."

}}

At the first open Pagan ritual that she attended, Berger met Andras Corban Arthen, the founder of the EarthSpirit Community (ESC), a Pagan organization open to non-Wiccans which she joined after paying the annual membership fee of $30. Attending many of the ESC's open rituals and festivals, she was introduced to a "diverse group" of Wiccans and other Pagans, and developed a contact base in the community.&lt;ref name="Berger 1999 xiv&amp;ndash;xv"/&gt; Berger and Arthen subsequently embarked on a project entitled "The Pagan Census" in an attempt to gain sociological data from the Pagan community across the U.S. Receiving funding from the Faculty Development Fund at West Chester University, Berger was aided in this project by over 15 students who helped her to code and enter data for the survey. Together, Berger and Arthen wrote and distributed their survey through Wiccan and Pagan organizations across the country, as well as in journals, on the internet and at festivals. The duo received over 2000 responses, providing Berger with one of her main sources of information.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. xvi&amp;ndash;xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout her 11-year period of fieldwork, Berger had to use [[snowball sampling]] to retrieve her data on the Pagan community, something that she attributed to the "secrecy of groups and practitioners". She conducted formal interviews with over 40 practicing Pagans, and over 60 others instead were informally interviewed during conversations at Pagan events, following which Berger recorded their responses in her fieldnotes. She participated in rituals with ten different Wiccan covens, two of which were all-female covens, and the other eight of which were mixed-gender in structure, but all of whom assembled in the Northeastern United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. xv&amp;ndash;xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting that this regional focus might affect her results, she supplemented her fieldwork by reading literature on Paganism from across the country, concluding that "the differences among groups and practitioners within the United States are less important than the similarities."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the sociologists Margot Adler and Loretta Orion, both of whom had been or became Pagans whilst studying the movement, Berger stated that she had not joined the religion, thereby remaining an "outsider" throughout her research, but had made many friends within the Pagan community.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Community of Witches'' was a part of a series of books entitled 'Studies in Comparative Religion' that were published by the University of South Carolina Press, and edited by Frederick M. Denny. In Denny's preface to the book, he remarked that it "adds significantly to the steadily growing scholarly literature" on the subject of Wicca and contemporary Paganism, being of "considerable use for our understanding of how other new religious communities are sustaining and developing themselves in the unprecedented rich tapestry of American religious pluralism."&lt;ref&gt;Denny in [[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. p. preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with a preface in which Berger explains how she first began studying the Wiccan and Pagan community of New England, Berger opens the main part of her book with a description of a [[Wiccaning]] which she attended.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. 1&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeding to introduce both the Wiccan religion and her theoretical approach, Berger explains the British sociologist [[James A. Beckford]]'s approach to the religions of late modernity as well as [[Anthony Giddens]]' theoretical approaches to modernism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. 4&amp;ndash;12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second chapter, "The Magical Self", Berger examines the ways in which Wiccans in the U.S. understand themselves, looking at sociological ideas about self-identity and utilising them in her analysis of Wiccan rituals that deal with the transformation of the self. She moves on to look at concepts of [[gender]] in the Wiccan community, both for men and women and among homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. 26&amp;ndash;46.&lt;/ref&gt; The third chapter, entitled "The Coven: Perfect Love, Perfect Trust", provides an explanation of the coven system within Wicca, and the ways in which friendships are built and collapse amongst coven members, and the extent to which covens imitate family structures.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. 47&amp;ndash;64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter four, "A Circle within a Circle: The Neo-Pagan Community", looks at the wider community beyond the coven structure, interpreting it through theoretical ideas about community in late modernity. Moving on, Berger looks at ideas of community memory and community building amongst U.S. Pagans, before examining the manner in which some Pagans engage in both emancipatory politics and life politics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. 65&amp;ndash;81.&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth chapter, entitled "The Next Generation", is devoted to the place of children within the Pagan community, and deals with ideas of rites of passage, attitudes towards children's sexuality and the extent to which children are involved in rituals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. 82&amp;ndash;99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sixth chapter, "The Routinization of Creativity", looks at the relationship between Wicca and routinization, and examines how the anti-authoritarian ethos of the religion has been in part eroded through the creation of Pagan organisations like the EarthSpirit Community and the [[Circle Sanctuary]], which have purchased land and led to the development of a paid clergy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. 100&amp;ndash;122.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Berger concludes her work with a round-up of her study, and muses on the possible future for Wicca in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. 123&amp;ndash;130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==

===Wicca as a religion of late modernity&lt;!--linked from 'Structuration theory'--&gt;===
[[File:Anthony Giddens at the Progressive Governance Converence, Budapest, Hungary, 2004 October.jpg|thumb|150px|The structuration theory of British sociologist Anthony Giddens played a significant influence on Berger's study.]]
Whereas the sociologist Loretta Orion had believed that contemporary Paganism was a [[postmodernism|postmodern]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ori95|Orion 1995]]. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; in ''A Community of Witches'', Berger argued against this, instead considering Wicca to be a religion of [[late modernity]]. In supporting this position, Berger turned to the work of the British sociologist of religion, James A. Beckford (1942&amp;ndash;), who in his book ''Religion and Advanced Industrial Society'' (1989) had argued that many new religious movements reflect the characteristics of late modernity by challenging traditional definitions of religion, sharing a holistic worldview and emphasising the development and transformation of the self.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bec89|Beckford 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt; Berger stated that while "Wicca is not specifically mentioned by Beckford, it does fit the model of [[New Age]] religions that he is analyzing."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst accepting that elements of postmodernism can be found within Wicca, Berger argued that the religion does not "signify an epistemological break with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought", and that as such it was intrinsically late modernist in structure; as she related, the "emphasis on globalism, the belief in personal and social transformation, and the use of noninstrumental rationality place Wicca firmly within the Enlightenment tradition."&lt;ref name="Berger 1999 6"&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berger's choice of "framework for understanding Wicca within the context of late modernity" was that of [[structuration]], a theory put forward by the English sociologist and political theorist [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Anthony Giddens]] (1938&amp;ndash;) in his book ''The Constitution of Society'' (1984).&lt;ref name="Berger 1999 6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gid84|Giddens 1984]].&lt;/ref&gt; Structuration theory maintains that both [[structure and agency]] influence human beings in their choices; the former refers to the recurrent patterned arrangements which influence or limit the choices and opportunities available for an individual, whilst the latter refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices. Berger argued that whilst the beliefs and practices of Wiccans were "in part determined by social factors, such as class, race and gender", at the same time these Wiccans exerted a level of control and self-determination over their lives "both by the very act of becoming a Witch and through the self-conscious use of rituals to create a persona."&lt;ref name="Berger 1999 8"&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wicca as a result of globalism===
Berger was of the opinion that Wicca's "development and spread" could be seen as "an outgrowth of [[globalism]]".&lt;ref name="Berger 1999 xiii"/&gt; As evidence, she noted that the religion had been created by modern westerners adopting elements from a variety of "older and geographically disparate religious practices" in order to fashion their new faith, something which she believed was only possible in a globalised world.&lt;ref name="Berger 1999 xiii"/&gt;

===The future of Wicca===
Whereas Mary Jo Neitz (1991) and Nancy J. Finley (1991) had both argued that ultimately, it would be the feminist-orientated, female-only form of Wicca found in the [[Dianic Wicca|Dianic tradition]] that would grow to become dominant in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nei91|Neitz 1991]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fin91|Finley 1991]].&lt;/ref&gt; Berger disagreed, arguing that "inclusive groups", meaning those traditions who welcome both men and women into their covens, "will ultimately prove to be more significant."&lt;ref name="Berger 1999 14"&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; She believed that this was in part because they "are more likely to include and fully involve children in their practices", something which she saw as having the likely "greatest impact" on the future of Wicca in the United States.&lt;ref name="Berger 1999 14"/&gt; In Berger's view, these children born into the faith would act as "maintainers of their families' practice", replacing the role that had formerly been played by neophytes in the community.&lt;ref name="Berger 1999 15"&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and recognition==

===Academic reviews===

In a review published in the ''Review of Religious Research'' journal, Stephen D. Glazier of the [[University of Nebraska]] described ''A Community of Witches'' as an "important study" which had "many virtues and few faults." Glazier commended it as an improvement on earlier sociological studies of contemporary Paganism, which in his opinion had dwelt on "personal experiences" and acted as something of "proselytizers for Neo-Pagan beliefs and practices." He furthermore praised Berger for "maintaining a high degree of theoretical sophistication" while still "remaining accessible for the average reader". He also expressed several criticisms, for instance noting that Berger had used the terms "Wiccan" and "Neo-Pagan" interchangeably, even though they have different meanings, something that he felt might confuse some of the book's readers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gla99|Glazier 1999]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In her review of ''A Community of Witches'' published in the ''Sociology of Religion'' journal, Frances Kostarelos of the [[Governors State University]] commented positively on Berger's work, describing it as "an invaluable theoretical and descriptive account of Wicca" that is also "a fine example of ethnographic research and writing."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kos99|Kostarelos 1999]].&lt;/ref&gt; Stefanie von Schnurbein of the [[University of Chicago]] described ''A Community of Witches'' as "an exciting and important approach to the study of contemporary neopaganism" in her review published in ''[[The Journal of Religion]]''. Schnurbein believed that Berger "has an intimate knowledge of her field and makes creative and interesting use of contemporary sociological theory" but that a "discussion of the vivid cultural and theoretical controversies around gender and sexuality would have added to the theoretical value of Berger's book."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch00|Schnurbein 2000]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the ''[[Contemporary Sociology (journal)|Contemporary Sociology]]'' journal, Tanice G. Foltz of [[Indiana University Northwest]] described ''A Community of Witches'' as "Well organized, clearly written, and aimed at an academic audience". Believing it to be a "valuable addition to the existing scholarship on witchcraft", Foltz did highlight some problems with the work, wishing that it had included an "in-depth analysis" of her Pagan Census survey and noting that it erroneously used the terms "Neo-Paganism", "Witchcraft" and "Wicca" interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fol00|Foltz 2000]].&lt;/ref&gt; In her review for the ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'', Mary Jo Neitz of the [[University of Missouri]] was more critical, arguing that Berger had generalised information from the north-eastern U.S. and claimed that it was applicable for the Pagan community across the entire country, something which Neitz felt was counter to her "own observations of Wicca."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nei00|Neitz 2000]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wider recognition===
''A Community of Witches'' was awarded the A List Exceptional Books of 1999 Award.&lt;ref&gt;[[#WSRC|Women's Studies Research Center]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was also mentioned by Canadian [[religious studies]] scholar Barbara Jane Davy in her 2007 work, ''[[Introduction to Pagan Studies]]'', during which she listed the books on Pagan Studies that had then seen publication.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dav07|Davy 2007]]. p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Berger's later work==
The publication of ''A Community of Witches'' did not signal the end of Berger's studies on the subject of American Paganism, and over the following several years she would publish several more volumes detailing her work in this area. In 2003, she co-authored a book delving deeper into the results of the Pagan Census that she had undertaken with Andras Corban Arthen. Entitled ''Voices from the Pagan Census: A National Survey of Witches and Neo-Pagans in the United States'', it was co-written with Leigh S. Shaffer, a fellow professor of sociology at West Chester University, and also with Evan A. Leach, then an associate professor of management at West Chester. Like ''A Community of Witches'', ''Voices from the Pagan Census'' was published by the University of South Carolina Press in their series on 'Studies in Comparative Religion', and in his preface to the book, the series editor Frederick M. Denny referred to it as the "sequel" to Berger's earlier work.&lt;ref name="Berger et al. xii"&gt;[[#Ber03|Berger, Leach and Shaffer 2003]]. p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their preface, Berger, Leach and Shaffer discussed the Pagan Census and how it had been used in producing ''A Community of Witches''; they noted that at the time Berger had originally written the book, "the rest of the data had not been completely processed, cleaned, and analyzed. Unlike that book, which relied primarily on her ethnographic research in the northeastern United States and an analysis of journals, books, and newsletters written by Neo-Pagans, this one is based primarily on the survey data."&lt;ref name="Berger et al. xvii"&gt;[[#Ber03|Berger, Leach and Shaffer 2003]]. p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[University of Pennsylvania]] published an edited anthology entitled ''Witchcraft and Magic in the New World: North America in the Twentieth Century'', which had been edited by Berger.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber05|Berger 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Berger's third book was published, ''Teenage Witches: Magical Youth and the Search for the Soul'', which had been co-written with Douglas Ezzy, a senior lecturer in sociology at the [[University of Tasmania]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber07|Berger and Ezzy 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laura Bush talks with African boy.jpg|thumb|275px|[[Laura Bush]] with an [[AIDS orphan]] at a center in [[HIV/AIDS in Zambia|Zambia]] that promotes abstinence and faith for youth.]]
'''Abstinence-only sex education''' is a form of [[sex education]] that teaches [[Sexual abstinence|not having sex]] outside of marriage. It often excludes other types of [[sexual and reproductive health]] education, such as [[birth control]] and [[safe sex]]. [[Comprehensive Sex Education|Comprehensive sex education]], by contrast, covers the use of birth control and sexual abstinence.

Evidence does not support the effectiveness of abstinence-only sex education.&lt;ref name=Obs2007&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/GCO.0b013e3282efdc0b |pmid=17885460 |title=Abstinence and abstinence-only education |journal=Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=446–52 |year=2007 |last1=Ott |first1=Mary A |last2=Santelli |first2=John S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chin2012&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2011.11.006 |pmid=22341164 |title=The Effectiveness of Group-Based Comprehensive Risk-Reduction and Abstinence Education Interventions to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Adolescent Pregnancy, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, and Sexually Transmitted Infections |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=272–94 |year=2012 |last1=Chin |first1=Helen B |last2=Sipe |first2=Theresa Ann |last3=Elder |first3=Randy |last4=Mercer |first4=Shawna L |last5=Chattopadhyay |first5=Sajal K |last6=Jacob |first6=Verughese |last7=Wethington |first7=Holly R |last8=Kirby |first8=Doug |last9=Elliston |first9=Donna B |last10=Griffith |first10=Matt |last11=Chuke |first11=Stella O |last12=Briss |first12=Susan C |last13=Ericksen |first13=Irene |last14=Galbraith |first14=Jennifer S |last15=Herbst |first15=Jeffrey H |last16=Johnson |first16=Robert L |last17=Kraft |first17=Joan M |last18=Noar |first18=Seth M |last19=Romero |first19=Lisa M |last20=Santelli |first20=John }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found to be ineffective in decreasing [[HIV]] risk in the [[developed world]].&lt;ref name=Un2007&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005421.pub2 |title=Abstinence-only programs for HIV infection prevention in high-income countries |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2007 |last1=Underhill |first1=Kristen |last2=Operario |first2=Don |last3=Montgomery |first3=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not decrease rates of sexual activity or [[unplanned pregnancy]] when compared to comprehensive sex education.&lt;ref name=Obs2007/&gt;

The topic of abstinence-only education is controversial in the United States, with proponents claiming that comprehensive sex education encourages premarital sexual activity, and critics arguing that abstinence-only education is religiously motivated and that the approach has been proven ineffective and even detrimental to its own aims.

==Description==
Abstinence education teaches children and [[adolescents]] to abstain from sexual activity, and that this is the only certain method of avoiding pregnancy and [[sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs). With a heavy focus on the importance of "family values," programs also teach that abstinence until marriage is a standard by which to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/edth.12034 |title=Just the Facts? The Separation of Sex Education from Moral Education |journal=Educational Theory |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=443–60 |year=2013 |last1=Lamb |first1=Sharon }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid17162310&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1931-2393.2006.tb00277.x |pmid=17162310 |title=Changes in Formal Sex Education: 1995?2002 |journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=182–9 |year=2006 |last1=Lindberg |first1=Laura Duberstein |last2=Santelli |first2=John S |last3=Singh |first3=Susheela }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
[[Systematic review]]s of research evaluating abstinence-only sex education have concluded that it is ineffective at preventing [[unwanted pregnancy]] or the spread of STIs, among other shortfalls.&lt;ref name=Obs2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirby2007"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kirby, D.|title=Emerging Answers 2007: Research Findings on Programs to Reduce Teen Pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted Diseases|publisher=National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy|year=2007|url=http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714125612/http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report|archivedate=2014-07-14|df=}} {{cite web |url=http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714125612/http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid27677440&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17437199.2016.1240625 |pmid=27677440 |title=A comprehensive review of reviews of school-based interventions to improve sexual-health |journal=[[Health Psychology Review]] |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=33–52 |year=2016 |last1=Denford |first1=Sarah |last2=Abraham |first2=Charles |last3=Campbell |first3=Rona |last4=Busse |first4=Heide }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] has recommended against the use of abstinence-only sex education because it has been found to be ineffective, and because the media frequently conveys information about non-abstinence.&lt;ref name=pmid20805150&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.2010-1544 |pmid=20805150 |title=Sexuality, Contraception, and the Media |journal=Pediatrics |volume=126 |issue=3 |pages=576–82 |year=2010 |last1=Strasburger |first1=V.

=== STI transmission ===
A 2015 meta-analysis found that abstinence-focused programs had no effect on the likelihood of contracting STDs.&lt;ref name=pmid26149164&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2174/1570162x13666150511143943 |pmid=26149164 |title=Effective Evidence-Based Programs for Preventing Sexually-Transmitted Infections: A Meta-Analysis |journal=Current HIV Research |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=432–8 |year=2015 |last1=Petrova |first1=Dafina |last2=Garcia-Retamero |first2=Rocio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Cochrane systematic review suggests that abstinence-only education neither increases nor decreases HIV risk in high-income countries.&lt;ref name=Un2007/&gt; In the developing world there is a lack of evidence of effect.&lt;ref name=pmid24594648&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0089692 |pmid=24594648 |pmc=3942389 |title=School Based Sex Education and HIV Prevention in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=e89692 |year=2014 |last1=Fonner |first1=Virginia A |last2=Armstrong |first2=Kevin S |last3=Kennedy |first3=Caitlin E |last4=O'Reilly |first4=Kevin R |last5=Sweat |first5=Michael D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[Douglas Kirby]] reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of abstinence-only education programs and found little evidence to justify the use of such programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1525/srsp.2008.5.3.18 |title=The impact of abstinence and comprehensive sex and STD/HIV education programs on adolescent sexual behavior |journal=Sexuality Research and Social Policy |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=18 |year=2008 |last1=Kirby |first1=Douglas B }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 meta-analysis found that it was ineffective at reducing the risk of HIV infection among adolescents.&lt;ref name=pmid21199984&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2010.251 |title=Interventions to Reduce Sexual Risk for Human Immunodeficiency Virus in Adolescents |journal=Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine |volume=165 |year=2011 |last1=Johnson |first1=Blair T |last2=Scott-Sheldon |first2=Lori A.

=== Pregnancy ===
Research conducted on 48 states of United States showed that "The level of abstinence education (no provision, covered, promoted, stressed) was positively correlated with both teen pregnancy and teen birth rates.&lt;ref name=pmid22022362/&gt; Also, in John S. Santelli's research, the decline of teenage pregnancy rates during 1995&amp;ndash;2002 were largely due to improved contraception, and the reduction in pregnancy risk among teenagers at age of 18 or 19 is entirely ascribed to more contraception.&lt;ref name=pmid17138906&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2006.089169 |pmid=17138906 |pmc=1716232 |title=Explaining Recent Declines in Adolescent Pregnancy in the United States: The Contribution of Abstinence and Improved Contraceptive Use |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=150–6 |year=2007 |last1=Santelli |first1=John S |last2=Lindberg |first2=Laura Duberstein |last3=Finer |first3=Lawrence B |last4=Singh |first4=Susheela }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[SIECUS]], the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, "[s]cientific evidence simply does not support an abstinence-only-until-marriage approach."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siecus.org/_data/global/images/research_says.pdf SIECUS Fact Sheet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616150557/http://www.siecus.org/_data/global/images/research_says.pdf |date=2010-06-16 }} (includes research citations).&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 report by the [[Guttmacher Institute]] pointed out that pregnancy rates for teens 15–19 reversed their decline in 2006, near the peak of the Abstinence Only campaign in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Table 1.0,"U.S. Teenage Pregnancies, Births and Abortions: National and State Trends and Trends by Race and Ethnicity." {{cite web |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2010/01/26/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129204657/http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2010/01/26/index.html |archivedate=2010-01-29 |df= }}, downloaded 20100127.&lt;/ref&gt;

While sex education has been linked to a delay in the first time having sex,&lt;ref name=pmid22999833&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2011.12.028 |pmid=22999833 |laysource=Guttmacher Institute |laysummary=https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2012/sex-education-linked-delay-first-sex |laydate=March 8, 2012 |title=Consequences of Sex Education on Teen and Young Adult Sexual Behaviors and Outcomes |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=332–8 |year=2012 |last1=Lindberg |first1=Laura Duberstein |last2=Maddow-Zimet |first2=Isaac }}&lt;/ref&gt; abstinence-only programs specifically haven't shown this link, and do not seem to influence if or when young people begin having sex.&lt;ref name=pmid18346659&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2007.08.026 |pmid=18346659 |title=Abstinence-Only and Comprehensive Sex Education and the Initiation of Sexual Activity and Teen Pregnancy |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=344–51 |year=2008 |last1=Kohler |first1=Pamela K |last2=Manhart |first2=Lisa E |last3=Lafferty |first3=William E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of abstinence-only sex education argue that this approach is superior to comprehensive sex education because it emphasizes the teaching of morality that limits sex to that within the bounds of marriage, and that [[premarital sex|sex before marriage]] and at a [[Child sexuality|young age]] has heavy physical and emotional costs.&lt;ref&gt;PBS, February 4, 2005 [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week823/feature.html Religion &amp; Ethics Newsweekly, Episode 823] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310182953/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week823/feature.html |date=2012-03-10 }} Retrieved on 2007-14-03&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, abstinence programs often teach young people that pleasure in sex is most likely to be found within marriage, and therefore, that they should wait to engage in sexual activity until they are married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14681811.2012.738604 |title=The use and misuse of pleasure in sex education curricula |journal=Sex Education |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=305–18 |year=2013 |last1=Lamb |first1=Sharon |last2=Lustig |first2=Kara |last3=Graling |first3=Kelly }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abstinence generally places a great emphasis on the importance of the institution of marriage, which some proponents believe allows young people to grow and develop as individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Sex Goes To School: Warring Views On Sex - And Sex Education - Since The Sixties|last=Luker|first=Kristin|publisher=W.

Proponents suggest that comprehensive sex education encourages premarital sexual activity among teenagers, which should be discouraged in an era when [[HIV]] and other incurable STIs are widespread and when [[teen pregnancy]] is an ongoing concern. Many supporters of abstinence-only education do so out of the belief that comprehensive guides to sex or information about contraceptives will ultimately result in teens actively pursuing and engaging in sexual activities,&lt;ref name=pmid22022362&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0024658 |pmid=22022362 |pmc=3194801 |title=Abstinence-Only Education and Teen Pregnancy Rates: Why We Need Comprehensive Sex Education in the U.S |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=e24658 |year=2011 |last1=Stanger-Hall |first1=Kathrin F |last2=Hall |first2=David W }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others oppose the endorsement of contraception for religious reasons.&lt;ref name="Contra-Contraception"&gt;{{cite news |last=Shorto |first=Russel |title=Contra-Contraception |newspaper=New York Times Magazine |date=May 7, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318073038/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |archivedate=March 18, 2017 |df= }}{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318073038/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |archivedate=2017-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teenagers are framed as less intelligent and less responsible than adults.

===Opposition ===
Opponents and critics, which include prominent professional associations in the fields of medicine, public health, adolescent health, and psychology, argue that such programs fail to provide adequate information to protect the health of adolescents. Not only is information inadequate, but opponents believe that young people have the right to receive comprehensive information about how to protect themselves and their sexual health.&lt;ref name=pmid16387256&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2005.10.006 |pmid=16387256 |title=Abstinence and abstinence-only education: A review of U.S. Policies and programs |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=72–81 |year=2006 |last1=Santelli |first1=John |last2=Ott |first2=Mary A |last3=Lyon |first3=Maureen |last4=Rogers |first4=Jennifer |last5=Summers |first5=Daniel |last6=Schleifer |first6=Rebecca }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accurate information is especially important since, although some supporters may claim that abstinence is an effective method, it has been found that a small percentage of people actually practice it.&lt;ref name=pmid16387256/&gt;

Some critics also argue that such programs verge on religious interference in secular education. Opponents of abstinence-only education dispute the claim that comprehensive sex education encourages teens to have premarital sex.&lt;ref name="Kirby"&gt;Douglas Kirby, Ph.

According to [[Advocates for Youth]], abstinence-only sex education distorts information about contraceptives, including only revealing failure rates associated with their use, and ignoring discussion of their benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Effective Sex Education, Brigid McKeon, 2006; {{cite web |url=http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=450&amp;Itemid=336 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419141940/http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=450&amp;Itemid=336 |archivedate=2010-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The language surrounding medicine and health is construed  as being both objective and value free.&lt;ref name=pmid23468394/&gt; This objectivity is then adopted by conservative politicians and campaigners to assert authority which historically holds its basis in religion.&lt;ref name="Hawaii of Manoa"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beh|first1=Hazel Glenn|last2=Diamond|first2=Milton|title=The Failure of Abstinence-only Education: minors have a right to honest talk about sex|journal=Columbia Journal of Gender and Law|date=2006|volume=15|issue=1|pages=12–62|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2005to2009/2006-failure-of-abstinence-only-education.html|accessdate=9 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516171135/http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2005to2009/2006-failure-of-abstinence-only-education.html|archivedate=16 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstinence-only education is not supported by the majority of public school teachers, parents, and students. The majority in each of these groups is opposed to abstinence-only curriculum and wants a more comprehensive curriculum. "Although more than nine in 10 teachers believe that students should be taught about contraception... one in four are instructed not to teach the subject." Even when there are no rules limiting sex education to abstinence-only, teachers may continue to teach abstinence-only curriculum because they fear retaliation from the local community. Parents also want their children to be taught about contraception. "Most parents (65%) believe that sex education should encourage young people to delay sexual activity but also prepare them to use birth control and practice safe sex once they do become sexually active." 86% of parents want schools to teach their children how to get STD testing, 77% want their children to learn how to talk to a partner about STDs and birth control, 71% want them to learn how to use condoms, and 68% want them to learn about using other forms of birth control. Students are also opposed to abstinence-only education. "Approximately half of students in grades 7-12 report needing more information about what to do in the event of rape or sexual assault, how to get tested for HIV and other STDs, and how to talk with a partner about birth control and STDs." Clearly, there is a disparity between the type of sex education curriculum teachers, parents, and students want and what government policy determines they receive.&lt;ref&gt;Dailard, Cynthia. "Sex Education: Politicians, Parents, Teachers, and Teens." ''The Reproductive Rights Reader''. Nancy Ehrenreich, Ed. New York City, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Definition ===
Another problem for abstinence education is the definition of abstinence. Santelli (2006) states that there is no strict definition of abstinence within the US federal government guidelines for teaching abstinence-only sex education, using a mixture of non-specific phrases, like "postponing sex" or "never had [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal sex]]," while also using moralistic terms or phrases like ''[[virgin]]'', ''chaste'', and "making a commitment".&lt;ref name="pmid16387256"/&gt; This has resulted in sexual activities that are not penile-vaginal, including [[mutual masturbation]], [[oral sex]] and [[anal sex]], being considered outside of the scope of abstention from sex, which is termed ''[[technical virginity]].''&lt;ref name="Intimate"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bryan Strong |author2=Christine DeVault |author3=Theodore F. Cohen |title=The Marriage and Family Experience: Intimate Relationship in a Changing Society| publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2010|accessdate=October 8, 2011 |page=186| isbn=0-534-62425-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qjvoSOMB5JMC&amp;pg=PA186|quote=Most people agree that we maintain virginity as long as we refrain from sexual (vaginal) intercourse.

PEPFAR was founded in 2003 with the mandate that 33% of its funds provided for prevention be used for abstinence-only education.

=== Funding ===
In the U.S., states may apply for federal funding of abstinence-only sex education programs from either Title V, the [[Adolescent Family Life Act]] (AFLA), and/or Community-Based Abstinence Education (CBAE).&lt;ref name=pmid22022362/&gt; To be eligible for funding, programs must satisfy requirements given under the Social Security Act, which is reproduced here verbatim:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title05/0510.htm Social Security Act, Section 510] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026183857/http://ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title05/0510.htm |date=2011-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(2) For purposes of this section, the term "abstinence education" means an educational or motivational program which—
:(A) has as its exclusive purpose, teaching the social, psychological, and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity;
:(B) teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected standard for all school age children;
:(C) teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems;
:(D) teaches that a mutually faithful monogamous relationship in context of marriage is the expected standard of human sexual activity;
:(E) teaches that sexual activity outside of the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects;
:(F) teaches that bearing children out-of-wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child’s parents, and society;
:(G) teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol and drug use increases vulnerability to sexual advances; and
:(H) teaches the importance of attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in sexual activity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Funding, which began in the 1980s, has continued to increase since its inception, though support for the programs and legislation surrounding them has become dependent upon the current administration.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10282580.2010.517970 |title=Barack Obama vs Bristol Palin: Why the President's sex education policy wins |journal=Contemporary Justice Review |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=411–24 |year=2010 |last1=Weiser |first1=Dana A |last2=Miller |first2=Monica K }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[George W. Bush administration]] increased federal funding for abstinence-only programs (the only type funded even under the previous [[Clinton Administration]]), while the [[Obama administration]] reversed the emphasis and provided more federal dollars for comprehensive sex education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://secondnexus.com/news/politics/donald-trump-abstinence-only-education-aoum-budget/ Trump Ignores Scientific Evidence Proving Abstinence Only Education Doesn’t Work]&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Donald Trump]] cut grants to comprehensive sex education&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-cuts-short-teen-pregnancy-prevention-program-funding/ Trump administration cuts short teen pregnancy prevention program funding]&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed increased funding for abstinence-only education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thecut.com/2017/05/trump-budget-abstinence-only-sex-ed.html Trump’s Proposed Budget Would Invest $277 Million in Abstinence-Only Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
The [[Christian Right]], who initially stood against having school-based sex education programs, began supporting abstinence-only programs due to the focus on marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/publius/pjr052 |jstor=41682905 |title=Saying No to Abstinence-Only Education: An Analysis of State Decision-Making |journal=Publius: the Journal of Federalism |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=613–35 |year=2012 |last1=Doan |first1=A. E |last2=McFarlane |first2=D. R }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a driving force behind the abstinence movement, they have focused on getting more funding for these programs and have also been successful in creating more awareness surrounding abstinence through their use of activism.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1363460711406460 |title=Battling a 'sex-saturated society': The abstinence movement and the politics of sex education |journal=Sexualities |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=416–43 |year=2011 |last1=Calterone Williams |first1=Jean }}&lt;/ref&gt; To the New Right, the abstinence-only sex education movement was an opportunity and an avenue to change the current view and status of sexuality in America, aligning it more with their own values, and as a result, creating individuals who remained abstinent until marriage, and thus, citizens who embodied values of self-discipline and morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00335630.2016.1209548 |title=Chastity for democracy: Surplus repression and the rhetoric of sex education |journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=353–75 |year=2016 |last1=Kelly |first1=Casey Ryan }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, abstinence-only programs utilize ideas of individualism and personal responsibility when educating young people about sex, seeking to create individuals who take responsibility for sexuality and morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1743923X09000154 |title=Whose Responsibility?

===Religion===
Religious doctrines take varying stances on contraception and pre-marital sex, some of which are covered by:

*[[Religion and birth control]]
*[[Christian views on contraception]]
*[[Protestant views on birth control]]
*[[Catholic teachings on sexual morality]]
*[[Sexuality and Mormonism]]
*[[Fornication]]
*[[Fornication#Islam|Premarital sex in Islam]]

The philosophical [[sex-positive movement]] cuts across many religions, and rejects the idea that consensual pre-marital sex or contraception are immoral.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6257">'''Analytical quality control''', commonly shortened to '''AQC''' refers to all those processes and procedures designed to ensure that the results of [[laboratory]] [[analysis]] are consistent, comparable, [[accuracy|accurate]] and within specified limits of [[Accuracy and precision|precision]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemex.co.uk/quality/aqc/program analytical quality control (AQC) program to ensure the highest level of confidence in reported data] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328092425/http://www.chemex.co.uk/quality/aqc/program |date=March 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Constituents submitted to the analytical laboratory must be accurately described to avoid faulty interpretations, approximations, or incorrect results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/region6/qa/qadevtools/mod4references/analytical_references/qc_handbook.pdf HANDBOOK FOR ANALYTICAL QUALITY CONTROL IN WATER AND WASTEWATER LABORATORIES] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114000648/http://www.epa.gov/region6/qa/qadevtools/mod4references/analytical_references/qc_handbook.pdf |date=November 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The qualitative and quantitative data generated from the laboratory can then be used for decision making. In the chemical sense, quantitative analysis refers to the measurement of the amount or concentration of an element or chemical compound in a matrix that differs from the element or compound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull153/15305001719.pdf An IAEA Service: Analytical Quality Control] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114001839/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull153/15305001719.pdf |date=November 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fields such as industry, medicine, and law enforcement can make use of AQC.

==In the laboratory==
AQC processes are of particular importance in laboratories analysing environmental samples where the concentration of chemical species present may be extremely low and close to the detection limit of the analytical method. In well managed laboratories, AQC processes are built into the routine operations of the laboratory often by the random introduction of known standards into the sample stream or by the use of spiked samples.

Quality control begins with sample collection and ends with the reporting of data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/water/publications/documents/guidancelaboratories.pdf TECHNICAL REPORT: GUIDANCE TO OPERATION OF WATER QUALITY LABORATORIES]&lt;/ref&gt; AQC is achieved through laboratory control of analytical performance. Initial control of the complete system can be achieved through specification of laboratory services, instrumentation, glassware, reagents, solvents, and gases. However, evaluation of daily performance must be documented to ensure continual production of valid data. A check should first be done to ensure that the data should be seen is precise and accurate. Next, systematic daily checks such as analysing blanks, calibration standards, quality control check samples, and references must be performed to establish the reproducibility of the data. The checks help certify that the methodology is measuring what is in the sample.

The quality of individual AQC efforts can be variable depending on the training, professional pride, and importance of a particular project to a particular analyst. The burden of an individual analyst originating AQC efforts can be lessened through the implementation of quality assurance programs. Through the implementation of established and routine quality assurance programs, two primary functions are fulfilled: the determination of quality, and the control of quality. By monitoring the accuracy and precision of results, the quality assurance program should increase confidence in the reliability of the reported analytical results, thereby achieving adequate AQC.

==Pharmaceutical industry==
Validation of analytical procedures is imperative in demonstrating that a drug substance is suitable for a particular purpose.&lt;ref name=validation&gt;[http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Quality/Q2_R1/Step4/Q2_R1__Guideline.pdf VALIDATION OF ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES: TEXT AND METHODOLOGY]&lt;/ref&gt; Common validation characteristics include: accuracy, precision (repeatability and intermediate precision), specificity, detection limit, quantitation limit, linearity, range, and robustness. In cases such as changes in synthesis of the drug substance, changes in composition of the finished product, and changes in the analytical procedure, revalidation is necessary to ensure quality control.

All analytical procedures should be validated. Identification tests are conducted to ensure the identity of an analyte in a sample through comparison of the sample to a reference standard through methods such as spectrum, chromatographic behavior, and chemical reactivity.&lt;ref name=validation /&gt; Impurity testing can either be a quantitative test or a limit test. Both tests should accurately measure the purity of the sample. Quantitative tests of either the active moiety or other components of a sample can be conducted through assay procedures. Other analytical procedures such as dissolution testing or particle size determination may also need to be validated and are equally important.

==Statistics==
Because of the complex inter-relationship between analytical method, sample concentration, limits of detection and method precision, the management of Analytical Quality Control is undertaken using a statistical approach to determine whether the results obtained lie within an acceptable statistical envelope.

==Inter-laboratory calibration==
In circumstances where more than one laboratory is analysing samples and feeding data into a large programme of work such as the [[Harmonised monitoring scheme]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], AQC can also be applied to validate one laboratory against another. In such cases the work may be referred to as '''inter-laboratory calibration'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/1979/AN/an9790400290 Analytical Quality Control in the Harmonised Monitoring Scheme ]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7306">'''Aquifer storage and recovery (ASR)''' is the direct injection of surface water supplies such as [[potable water]], reclaimed water, or river water into an [[aquifer]] for later recovery and use. ASR has been done for municipal, industry and [[irrigation|agriculture use]].

==ASR use in the United States==

=== Colorado ===
The first ASR well with a downhole control valve was installed in [[Highlands Ranch, CO]] in 1992 for Centennial Water and Sanitation District.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Baski Flow Control Valves, ASR Valves|url = http://www.baski.com/FlowControlValves.aspx|website = www.baski.com|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, over 40 ASR wells have been installed for many different municipalities.  These wells range in depths from {{convert|1,000|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|3,000|ft|abbr=on}} below ground surface, with injection rates commonly between {{convert|100|USgal|abbr=on}} and {{convert|500|USgal|abbr=on}} per minute (gpm) per well.

===Florida===
The use of ASR in Florida has been examined to determine potential benefits for the [[Everglades]] and other Florida water systems under the [[Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan]] (CERP). An estimate of 333 ASR wells would be implemented as part of CERP and used to store, treat and supply excess surface water to the Everglades and other systems of water during dry periods. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aquifer Storage and Recovery|url=http://my.sfwmd.gov/portal/page/portal/xweb%20-%20release%203%20water%20supply/aquifer%20storage%20and%20recovery|website=South Florida Water Management District}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aquifer Storage and Recovery Regional Study|url=http://www.saj.usace.army.mil/Portals/44/docs/FactSheets/ASR_FS_June2015_web.pdf|website=U.S. Army Corp of Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy====

Doubts remain about the benefit of introducing ASR in such large capacity to Florida due to a predominantly [[karst geography]]. Current or potential problems include: (1) poor recovery due to mixing of the injected fresh water with the existing brackish to saline water in the aquifer; (2) pre-existing quality of water introduced to ASR; and (3) potential risk of resulting water quality due to mixing of injected freshwater and existing aquifer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of Aquifer Storage and Recovery in the Floridan Aquifer System of Southern Florida|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2004/3128/|website=U.S. Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oregon===

The first agriculture ASR wells were put into service in [[Oregon]] in the autumn of 2006 and have injected well over {{convert|3000|acre.ft|m3}} of water during the winter and spring flood flow times using artificial recharge (AR) of flood water as their water source. This shallow recharged water is then recovered as potable water and injected into the deep basalt aquifer.

During the injection process, electrical energy can be generated by the [[head pressure]] of the water flowing back into the aquifer. This stored water is recovered during late summer and early autumn for irrigation needs.

Both of these well types use a down-hole control valve. ASR can also be used to re-inject water used by [[HVAC]] systems to maintain the ground water levels and store the thermal differences from summertime cooling for winter time heating. Industry can also capture cold winter waters and store it for summertime use and avoid the need for cooling water in the summer for industrial processes. This may also free up short supplies of summer time water for other beneficial uses. This reinjection process  may also avoid the cost of surface disposal and avoid the increased thermal load to the rivers and streams during the summer air conditioning season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3rvalve.com/|title=Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR)|author=Kent Madison|year=2008|publisher=3R Valve|accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texas===

The Texas cities of [[El Paso]], [[Kerrville]] and [[San Antonio]] use ASR, providing water resources to these water-vulnerable communities.&lt;ref name="state1"&gt;[http://www.trcc.state.tx.us/specialrpt/water/96-1746.pdf Texas Water Report: Going Deeper for the Solution] Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. Retrieved 2/11/14.&lt;/ref&gt; A University of Florida report ranked daily per-capita water availability for 225 large urban areas across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soils.ifas.ufl.edu/hydrology/cities/ Water availability ranking for 225 urban areas in the United States]. Environmental Hydrology Laboratory at the University of Florida. Retrieved 2/11/14.&lt;/ref&gt;  The study weighed fresh water available to cities from naturally occurring and constructed sources such as reservoirs, aquifers and imports. Of the cities reviewed, San Antonio ranked last, or most vulnerable, and El Paso ranked as 10th-worst, though other Texas cities made the list.&lt;ref name="state1"/&gt;

San Antonio stores drinking water in its Carrizo ASR facility, which contains more than 91,000 acre-feet of water and has a maximum capacity of 120,000 acre-feet.&lt;ref name="state1"/&gt;

A 2010 [[Texas Water Development Board]] (TWDB) survey of Texas water utilities found four primary objections to ASR in other parts of Texas: legal and physical limitations, the quality of the recovered water, cost-effectiveness and the potential for other pumpers to capture the utility’s stored water.&lt;ref name="state1"/&gt;

==ASR use in Australia==
[[File:Cooke Reserve wetland.JPG|thumb|Newly constructed wetland for final stage treatment of urban [[stormwater]] runoff for an ASR scheme in western [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlessturt.sa.gov.au/page.aspx?u=609 City of Charles Sturt &gt; Major Projects &gt; Water Proofing the West] Accessed 23 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In South Australia, the [[City of Salisbury]] in northern [[Adelaide]] has since 1994 played a pioneering role in establishing the viability of the capture and treatment of urban stormwater runoff within artificial wetlands, and injecting the treated water into Tertiary aquifers in winter, for later use by industry, and for irrigation of city parks and school playing fields in summer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salisbury.sa.gov.au/Our_City/Environment/Wetlands_and_Water City of Salisbury &gt; Environment &gt; Wetlands and Water] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325191534/http://www.salisbury.sa.gov.au/Our_City/Environment/Wetlands_and_Water |date=March 25, 2014 }} Accessed 22 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the capacity of the Salisbury ASR schemes was around 5 gigalitres per annum (expected to rise to 14 GL by 2014)&lt;ref&gt;Haines, S. (2009): [http://www.salisbury.sa.gov.au/files/1c9524b4-f17b-4650-ad4f-9e850103891b/watersensitivecities-paper.pdf Towards Water Sensitive Cities] City of Salisbury. Accessed 22 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and this success has led to other local government areas across Adelaide undertaking similar ASR projects.

'''Artificial philosophy''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] branch conceived by author Louis Molnar&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267156955_A_Step_Beyond_AI_Artificial_Philosophy "article: Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications", ResearchGate, (retrieved November 25, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; to consider what a being bestowed with [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) might consider about its own [[existence]] once it reaches a higher state of [[consciousness]]. The author reasons in his dissertation that at some point, either through [[Computer_programming|programming]] or organic [[self-development]], [[robot]]s will not see themselves as extensions of those that created them, and that their saying "Who am I?" will not lead them to think of themselves as one with [[human]]s.

Provide professional training to students by combining information technology with managerial skills.
*Prepare students to proceed on to post graduate level study in information management within and outside the country.

==Careers==
Graduating with a bachelors in Information Management highly beneficial as it opens up a plethora of career options and routes for students. This is manly due to the fact that employers now-a-days show a growing interest for applicants with both a business management education as well as an IT background. Paul Matthews from the Institute of IT Professionals stated that "Employers tell me the key thing holding them back is the ability to get skilled people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gifford|first1=Adam|title=Surge in demand for IT graduates|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10902070|website=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This degree would be beneficial as it is employable all over world. Every company has an IT department, which even in non-tech firms, play an essential role in the company's daily functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surfing a digital wave, or drowning?|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21591201-information-technology-everywhere-companies-it-departments-mixed|website=The Economist|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fine combination of IT and management that this degree offers, has shown career prospects in fields such as:
* Software Designers and Engineers
* Advertising and Marketing Executives
* IT Consultants and Planners
* Sales and retail assistants
* Chartered Accountants
* Computer programmers and programmer developers
* As well as many others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top destinations for "Information Management" graduates |url=http://wlgd.thecareersgroup.co.uk/Destinations/Subject/Information+Management |website=University of London |accessdate=29 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029133917/http://wlgd.thecareersgroup.co.uk/Destinations/Subject/Information%2BManagement |archivedate=29 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduates from these types of degrees have also found themselves working for some of the world's top organisations including Ernst and Young, Deloitte, Goldman Sachs, and Bruder Mannesmann &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Management for Business BSc|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/undergraduate/degrees/ubsinfsbus05|website=UCL|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post Graduate Programs==
Keep in mind that although you can start a career straight after your bachelors, you may also be interested in furthering your study by enrolling in a masters program. Employers seem to be finding that business management undergraduates are too keen on starting work immediately, without actually having attained the essential skills need for a professional workplace. This may be in terms of general maturity and also the students ability to 'hit the ground running'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What makes a business graduate more employable?|url=http://theconversation.com/what-makes-a-business-graduate-more-employable-31800|website=The Conversation|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is where masters students have the greater advantage.

There are many different masters programs available to graduates from an Information Management degree. However at this point, the studies tend to narrow down to more specific areas. As you have a solid background in both Business Management and IT, you have a large range to choose from.

If after studying you seem to be more keen in IT then perhaps you should consider doing a masters in either computer science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No. 2 Best Master's Degree For Jobs: Computer Science|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/efkk45ifij/no-2-best-masters-degree-for-jobs-computer-science/|website=Forbes|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or information systems.These two programs are some of the best for finding postgraduate jobs with high earning salaries.

==Student life==
Information Management students enrolled in a full-time degree generally have 8–13 hours a week in class, whether its lectures, tutorials, or seminars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BA in Information Management|url=http://www.cbs.dk/en/study/bachelor/ba-in-information-management/student-life|website=Copenhagen Business School|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However time must be spend outside of class working on coursework and assignments as well as doing prerequisite readings for certain modules.

One of the hardest parts about being a student is learning how to survive on a budget. To compensate for this, many students choose to get a part-time job while studying. In the United States, about 50% of students have a part-time job whilst enrolled in a full-time degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orszag|first1=Jonathan|title=LEARNING AND EARNING: WORKING IN COLLEGE|url=http://www.brockport.edu/career01/upromise|website=Brockport|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it becomes increasing difficult to balance a part-time job along with course work, classes, good grades, self study time, and social life. Often self study time suffers the most from part-time jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Richardson|first1=Mark|title=Academic plate spinning: The difficulties of balancing full time degree study with a part-time job |publisher=University of Worcester}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore it would be recommended to work no more than 10 hours a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BA in Information Management|url=http://www.cbs.dk/en/study/bachelor/ba-in-information-management/student-life|website=Copenhagen Business School|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bedford Institute of Oceanography''' ('''BIO''') is a major [[Government of Canada]] [[Oceanography|ocean research]] facility located in [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]], [[Nova Scotia]].  BIO is the largest ocean research station in Canada. Established in 1962 as Canada's first, and currently largest, federal centre for [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] research, BIO derives its name from the [[Bedford Basin]], an inland bay comprising the northern part of Halifax Harbour, upon which it is located.

Spread out over 40 [[acre]]s (160,000 m²) of a former [[Royal Canadian Navy]] (RCN) property near [[Shannon Park, Nova Scotia|Shannon Park]] in [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]], BIO consists of a series of interconnected buildings housing research labs and offices, as well as docks for [[Canadian Coast Guard]] and RCN research vessels.

As the federal government seeks to concentrate its operations in the [[Halifax Regional Municipality]], BIO is being considered for additional office buildings to house other non-oceanographic and non-research organizations and their employees. As such, new buildings have been built for the [[Canadian Coast Guard]] as well as [[Environment Canada]] in recent years.

==History==
[[File:CCGS Hudson2.gif|thumbnail|The research vessel CCGS ''Hudson'']]
Following World War II, the principal marine research facility of the Government of Canada was the [[St. Andrews Biological Station]]. Dr. W.E. van Steenburgh, Director-General of Scientific Services of the Department of Mines and Technical Surveys, championed the establishment of a modern oceanographic institute on [[Bedford Basin]]. The Bedford Institute of Oceanography and its research vessel, the [[CCGS Hudson|CCGS ''Hudson'']], were both inaugurated in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Brief History of BIO |url=http://www.bio.gc.ca/general-generales/history-historique-en.php |publisher=Bedford Institute of Oceanography |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201071807/http://www.bio.gc.ca/general-generales/history-historique-en.php |archivedate=1 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current operations==
BIO houses several organizations from various federal departments which perform targeted [[research]] mandated by government or in partnership, advise on [[ocean|marine]] environments, provide [[navigation]]al [[chart]]s covering [[Georges Bank]] to the [[Canadian Arctic]], and respond to environmental emergencies.

A team led by Dr. John Smith at BIO published the first paper on the spread of radioactivity across the Pacific Ocean following the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]]. The scientists gathered samples of water as far as {{convert|1500|km|miles}} off the coast of British Columbia to ascertain how long it took traces of cesium 137 and cesium 134 to reach the west coast of North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jes|first1=Burns|title=Fukushima radiation mapping in the Pacific could bolster climate science|url=http://www.opb.org/news/article/fukushima-radiation-mapping-in-the-pacific-could-b/|publisher=Oregon Public Broadcasting|date=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Netburn|first1=Deborah|title=Tracking the Fukushima radioactivity plume across the Pacific|url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-fukushima-radiation-plume-20141229-story.html|work=Los Angeles Times|date=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amos|first1=Jonathan|title=North American scientists track incoming Fukushima plume|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-26329323|work=BBC News|date=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Algar|first1=Jim|title=How Quickly Did Fukushima Radiation Reach North America, And When Will It Peak?|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/24309/20150102/how-quickly-did-fukushima-radiation-reach-north-america-and-when-will-it-peak.htm|work=Tech Times|date=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the institute received $3.5 million in federal funding for facilities upgrades. Much of the funding will be used to upgrade the fish lab, to upgrade the facilities of the Geological Survey of Canada, and for general building repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bradshaw|first1=Ray|title=Bedford Institute of Oceanography gets $3.5 million to fund upgrades|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1912114/bedford-institute-of-oceanography-gets-3-5-million-to-fund-upgrades/|work=Global News|date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal departments and agencies==
The following departments and agencies of the Government of Canada maintain facilities at BIO:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.gc.ca/about-sujet-eng.htm |title=About BIO |publisher=Bedford Institute of Oceanography |accessdate=25 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525210610/http://www.bio.gc.ca/about-sujet-eng.htm |archivedate=25 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
In addition to office and research space, BIO has extensive laboratories, particularly for performing research into aquatic species.  Tours of BIO are offered for visitors during the summer months and a popular tour destination are some of the large aquariums and tanks used for research.  There are also "touch tanks" in a facility called the Sea Pavilion where visitors are permitted to handle North Atlantic Lobster, Snow Crabs, Rock Crabs, [[Clams]] (also known as Pea Clams), Sea Urchins, Sea Cucumbers, and other species.    Some tanks are transparent and allow visitors to view giant [[mackerel]] and [[sturgeon]] as well as other rare and interesting specimens such as a lobster that is half male and half female.   The Sea Pavilion contains information concerning [[Leatherback Sea Turtle]]s, [[Atlantic Whitefish]], [[Northern Right Whale]]s, [[sharks]], [[Lake Whitefish]], [[Largemouth Bass]], [[Brook Trout]], Atlantic Wolffish, and Atlantic Pickerel.   There are also displays featuring protected areas such as [[Sable Island]] and [[The Gully (Atlantic)|The Gully]] and special interest areas such as [[Halifax Harbour]] and the [[Bay of Fundy]].

A '''biomarker, '''or '''biological marker,''' is defined as a "cellular, biochemical or molecular alteration in cells, tissues or fluids that can be measured and evaluated to indicate normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological responses to a therapeutic intervention."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayeux|first=Richard|date=April 2004|title=Biomarkers: Potential Uses and Limitations|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC534923/|journal=NeuroRx|volume=1|pages=182-188|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Biomarkers characterize disease progression starting from the earliest [[Natural history of disease|natural history of the disease]].  Biomarkers assess disease susceptibility and severity, which allows one to predict outcomes, determine interventions and evaluate therapeutic responses. From a forensics and epidemiologic perspective, biomarkers offer unique insight about the relationships between environmental risk factors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mayeux|first1=Richard|title=Biomarkers: Potential Uses and Limitations|pmc=534923|publisher=NeuroRX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classes of Biomarkers==
Three broad classes of biomarkers are '''prognostic biomarkers''', '''predictive biomarkers''' and '''pharmacodynamic biomarkers'''.

===Prognostic Biomarkers===
[[Prognosis|Prognostic]] biomarkers give intervention-independent information on disease status through screening, diagnosis and disease monitoring.  Prognostic biomarkers can signify individuals in the [[Incubation period|latent period]] of a disease's natural history, allowing optimal therapy and prevention until the disease's termination. Prognostic biomarkers give information on disease status by measuring the internal precursors that increase or decrease the likelihood of attaining a disease.  For example, [[blood pressure]] and [[cholesterol]] are biomarkers for [[Cardiovascular disease|CVD]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Prognostic biomarkers can be direct or indirect to the causal pathway of a disease.  If a prognostic biomarker is a direct step in the causal pathway, it is one of the factors or products of the disease.  A prognostic biomarker could be indirectly associated with a disease if it is related to a change caused by the exposure, or related to an unknown factor connected with the exposure or disease.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gainor|first1=Justin|last2=Longo|first2=Dan|last3=Chabner|first3=Bruce|title=Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers: Falling Short of the Mark?|url=http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/20/10/2587.full|publisher=AACR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predictive Biomarkers===
Predictive biomarkers measure the effect of a drug and tell if the drug is having its expected activity, but do not offer any direct information on the disease.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Predictive biomarkers are highly sensitive and specific; therefore they increase [[Diagnostic test|diagnostic]] validity of a drug or toxin's site-specific effect by eliminating recall bias and subjectivity from those exposed. For example, when an individual is exposed to a drug or toxin, the concentration of that drug or toxin within the body, or the '''[[Effective dose (pharmacology)|biological effective dose]]''', provides a more accurate prediction for the effect of the drug or toxin compared to an estimation or measurement of the toxin from the origin or external environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers===
[[Pharmacodynamics|Pharmacodynamic]] (PD) biomarkers can measure the direct interaction between a drug and its receptor.  Pharmacodynamic biomarkers reveal drug mechanisms, if the drug has its intended effect on the biology of the disease, ideal biological dosing concentrations, and physiologic response/resistance mechanisms. Pharmacodynamic biomarkers are particularly relevant in drug mechanisms of tumor cells, where pharmacodynamic endpoints for drug interventions can be assessed directly on tumor tissues.  For example, protein phosphorylation biomarkers indicate alterations in target [[protein kinases]] and activation of downstream signaling molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pharmacodynamic biomarkers for molecular cancer therapeutics|journal = Advances in Cancer Research|date = 2007-01-01|issn = 0065-230X|pmid = 17161682|pages = 213–268|volume = 96|doi = 10.1016/S0065-230X(06)96008-4|first = Debashis|last = Sarker|first2 = Paul|last2 = Workman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical Applications for Biomarkers==
Biomarkers can be classified on their clinical applications as '''molecular biomarkers,''' '''cellular biomarkers''' or '''imaging biomarkers'''.

===Molecular Biomarkers===
Four of the main types of molecular biomarkers are '''genomic biomarkers''', '''transcriptomic biomarkers''', '''proteomic biomarkers''' and '''metabolic biomarkers'''.

====Genomic Biomarkers====
Genomic biomarkers analyze DNA by identifying irregular sequences in the [[genome]], typically a [[single nucleotide polymorphism]].  Genetic biomarkers are particularly significant in cancer because most cancer cell lines carry somatic mutations.  Somatic mutations are distinguishable from hereditary mutations because the mutation is not in every cell; just the tumor cells, making them easy targets.

====Transcriptomic Biomarkers====


Transcriptomic biomarkers analyze all [[RNA]] molecules, not solely the [[exome]].  Transcriptomic biomarkers reveal the molecular identity and concentration of RNA in a specific cell or population. Pattern-based RNA expression analysis provides increased diagnostic and prognostic capability in predicting therapeutic responses for individuals. For example, distinct RNA subtypes in breast cancer patients have different survival rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blenkiron|first1=Cherie|last2=Goldstein|first2=Leonard|last3=Thorne|first3=Natalie|title=MicroRNA expression profiling of human breast cancer identifies new markers of tumor subtype|journal=Genome Biology|date=2007|doi=10.1186/gb-2007-8-10-r214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Proteomic Biomarkers====
[[Proteomics]] permits the quantitative analysis and detection of changes to proteins or protein biomarkers.  Protein biomarkers detect a variety of biological changes, such as protein-protein interactions, [[post-translational modifications]] and immunological responses. 

=== Cellular Biomarkers ===
Cellular biomarkers allow cells to be isolated, sorted, quantified and characterized by their [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[physiology]]. Cellular biomarkers are used in both clinical and laboratory settings, and can discriminate between a large sample of cells based on their [[antigen]]s. An example of a cellular biomarker sorting technique is [[Fluorescent-activated cell sorting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cellular biomarkers analysis - ImmuneHealth|url = http://www.immunehealth.eu/immunomonitoring-laboratory/cellular-platform/|website = ImmuneHealth|accessdate = 2015-11-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imaging Biomarkers===
Imaging biomarkers allow earlier detection of disease compared to molecular biomarkers, and streamline translational research in the drug discovery marketplace. For example, one could determine the percent of receptors a drug targets, shortening the time and money of research during the new drug development stage.  Imaging biomarkers also are non-invasive, which is a clinical advantage over molecular biomarkers. Some of the image-based biomarkers are [[X-ray crystallography|X-Ray]], [[Computed Tomography]] (CT), [[Positron Emission Tomography]] (PET), Single Photo Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Promise of Imaging Biomarkers|url=http://www.bio-itworld.com/uploadedFiles/Bio-IT_World/Whitepaper_SmartForms/Forms/PDF/Imaging_Biomarkers.PDF|publisher=Thomas Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of Biomarkers==
* '''Embryonic: '''Embryonic biomarkers are very important to fetuses, as each cell's role is decided through the use of biomarkers. Research has been conducted concerning the use of [[embryonic stem cell]]s (ESCs) in regenerative medicine. This is because certain biomarkers within a cell could be altered (most likely in the tertiary stage of their formation) to change the future role of the cell, thereby creating new ones. One example of an embryonic biomarker is the protein [[Oct-4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18763704 | doi=10.1002/pmic.200800073 | volume=8 | title=Cell surface biomarkers of embryonic stem cells | year=2008 | journal=Proteomics | pages=4025–35 | last1 = Nagano | first1 = K | last2 = Yoshida | first2 = Y | last3 = Isobe | first3 = T}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[File:CTC - in situ RNA hybridization.jpg|thumb|Multiplex analysis of circulating tumor cells using QuantiGene ViewRNA CTC Platform]]'''Cancer:''' Biomarkers have an extremely high upside for therapeutic interventions in cancer patients.  Most cancer biomarkers consist of proteins or altered segments of DNA, and are expressed in all cells, just at higher rates in cancer cells.  There has not yet been one, universal tumor biomarker, but there is a biomarker for every type of cancer.  These tumor biomarkers are used to track the health of tumors, but cannot serve as the sole diagnostic for specific cancers. Examples of tumoral markers used to follow up cancer treatment are the [[Carcinoembryonic antigen|Carcinoembryonic Antigen]] (CEA) for colorectal cancer and the [[Prostate Specific Antigen]] (PSA) for prostate cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tumor Markers|url = http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/diagnosis-staging/diagnosis/tumor-markers-fact-sheet|website = National Cancer Institute|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, Cancer research identified [[Circulating tumor cell|Circulating Tumor Cells]] (CTCs) and [[Cell-free tumour DNA|Circulating Tumor DNA]] (ctDNA) as [[Metastasis|metastasizing]] tumor biomarkers with special cellular differentiation and prognostic skills. Innovative technology needs to be harnessed to determine the full capabilities of CTCs and ctDNA, but insight into their roles has potential for new understanding of cancer evolution, invasion and metastasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Blood-Based Analyses of Cancer: Circulating Tumor Cells and Circulating Tumor DNA|url = http://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/content/4/6/650|journal = Cancer Discovery|date = 2014-06-01|issn = 2159-8274|pmc = 4433544|pmid = 24801577|pages = 650–661|volume = 4|issue = 6|doi = 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-1014|first = Daniel A.|last = Haber|first2 = Victor E.|last2 = Velculescu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Akli Adjaoute, while finishing his PhD in Artficial Intelligence &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/rylm-generateur-de-systemes-experts-pour-les-problemes-daide-aux-diagnostics-ykra-systeme-denseignement/oclc/490376189|title=PhD in Artificial Intelligence ( DOCTORAT D’ETAT) |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Pierre and Marie Curie University|Pierre and Marie Curie University]], founded his first company, Conception En Intelligence Artificielle in 1988 in Paris, France where he was able to successfully apply his years of research in the field of artificial intelligence  in various industries throughout Europe. Conception En Intelligence Artificielle initially offered Rylm, a platform (MINDsuite) based on Smart Agents, Neural Networks, Business Rules, Genetic Algorithms, Constraint Programming, Fuzzy Logic and Cased-based Reasoning.

Rylm’s first application was in the decommissioning of nuclear facilities and [[nuclear waste management|Radioactive waste]]. This application was led by the team that invented the programming language [[Prolog|PROLOG]] and is described in the [http://brighterion.com/articles/rylm_nuclear.pdf Radioactive Waste Handling Operations paper]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://brighterion.com/articles/rylm_nuclear.pdf|title=Radioactive Waste Handling Operations paper|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Rylm’s second application was in healthcare at Necker Hospital as highlighted by the French magazine [http://brighterion.com/articles/rylm_healthcare.pdf L’Usine Nouvelle Technologies]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://brighterion.com/articles/rylm_healthcare.pdf|title=L’Usine Nouvelle Technologies|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Another application of Rylm was in network troubleshooting as described in the French magazine [https://web.archive.org/web/20170813104157/http:/brighterion.com/articles/rylm_network_troubleshooting.pdf 01 Informatique]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813104157/http:/brighterion.com/articles/rylm_network_troubleshooting.pdf|title=01 Informatique|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The technology behind Rylm was also successfully applied in various other fields including: financials, supply chain, retail, and military.

Rylm has received recognition for its industry-leading technology including mention in the Meta Group report [https://web.archive.org/web/20170429211729/http:/brighterion.com/articles/rylm_metagroup_datamining.pdf Data Mining Market]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429211729/http:/brighterion.com/articles/rylm_metagroup_datamining.pdf|title= Meta Group report Data Mining Market|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; for best [[Machine learning|Machine Learning]] Technology.

In 2000, this technology formed the foundation of Brighterion, Inc. and in 2002, [[Raymond Kendall|Raymond Kendall]], three-time Secretary General of [[Interpol|INTERPOL]] joined the company as its chairman. Since the founding of Brighterion, the core technology has been adapted and improved for real-time applications in the fields of homeland security, payment, compliance, IoT, healthcare, and marketing.

Brighterion has received multiple awards including: the Payment Security Excellence Award, the 2017 Cool Vendor by Gartner, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-413QTFK&amp;ct=170524&amp;st=sb|title=Cool Vendors in Identity and Fraud Management, 2017|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Morgan Stanley Fintech Award&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.morganstanley.com/press-releases/morgan-stanley-recognizes-brighterion-with-fintech-award-at-firm|title=Morgan Stanley Recognizes Brighterion with Fintech Award at Firm’s Annual Fintech Summit 7|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2017/11/20/brighterion-anti-fraud-software-wins-morgan-stanley-first-fintech-award/|title=Brighterion's Artificial Intelligence Software Wins Morgan Stanley's First Fintech Award|author=Tom Groenfeldt|date=2017-11-20|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Brighterion holds several patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://patents.justia.com/assignee/brighterion-inc|title=Brighterion's patents|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, [[Mastercard]] acquired Brighterion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasdaq.com/article/mastercard-to-buy-brighterion-boost-artificial-intelligence-cm817435|title=Nasdaq : Mastercard to Buy Brighterion, Boost Artificial Intelligence|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newsroom.mastercard.com/press-releases/mastercard-enhances-artificial-intelligence-capability-with-the-acquisition-of-brighterion-inc-2/|title=Mastercard Enhances Artificial Intelligence Capability with the Acquisition of Brighterion, Inc.|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Centre for Economic Policy Research''' ('''CEPR''') is a network of over 1100 researchers who are based mainly in universities throughout [[Europe]] and collaborate through CEPR in research and its dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepr.org/aboutcepr/cepr/cepr_think.pdf |title=Think-Net concept |format=PDF |publisher=Cepr.org|date= |accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is funded by a registered, European charity founded in 1983 by [[Richard Portes]], [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]], [[CBE]].&lt;ref name=charity&gt;{{cite web | title= Details | url= http://web-archive-sources.org/july08.pdf | date= July 2008 | format= pdf | access-date= 2014-06-17 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141006083012/http://web-archive-sources.org/july08.pdf | archive-date= 2014-10-06 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  CEPR's office is located in [[London]].

==Mission==
The Centre's mission is to promote research excellence and policy relevance in European [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kirman | first1 = Alan | last2 = Dahl | first2 = Mogens | title = Economic research in Europe | journal = European Economic Review | volume = 38 | issue = 3-4 | pages = 505–522 | publisher = Elsevier | doi = 10.1016/0014-2921(94)90087-6 | date = April 1994 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0014-2921(94)90087-6 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CEPR network consists of over 900 Research Fellows and Affiliates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepr.org/researchers/resdesc.htm |title=Research Fellows and Affiliates |publisher=Cepr.org |date= |accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in over 237 different institutions in 28 countries (90% in the [[European Union]]). Because it draws on such a large network of researchers, CEPR is able to produce a wide range of research that reflects a broad spectrum of individual viewpoints and perspectives.

==Funding==
Beyond the funding provided by the registered, European charity founded in 1983 by [[Richard Portes]], [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]], [[CBE]].&lt;ref name=charity/&gt;{{dead link|date=December 2017}}  CEPR's office is located in [[London]], the Centre is financially supported also by a large number of [[central bank]]s, private financial institutions, and international organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepr.org/content/supporters-cepr |title = Supporters of CEPR |publisher=Cepr.org |date= |accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These institutional sponsors receive special benefits by obtaining different levels of membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepr.org/content/corporate-membership |title = Corporate Membership |publisher=Cepr.org |date= |accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre's annual return in 2013 stated that it had an income for the financial year 2012-2013 of £3,179,298 and an expenditure of £3,345,054.&lt;ref name=C_C&gt;{{cite web|title=The Centre for Economic Policy Research|url=http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=287287&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|publisher=Charity Commission|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion papers==
The Centre disseminates its research in the first instance through the CEPR Discussion Paper Series, in which it publishes almost 700 papers annually. As of April 2013, the CEPR series is ranked ninth among all economics working paper series and journals in terms of total downloads, according to the [[Research Papers in Economics|RePEc]] database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://logec.repec.org/scripts/seriesstat.pl |title=LogEc Toplisting |publisher=Logec.repec.org |accessdate=1 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==VoxEU.org==
VoxEU.org is the policy portal set up by CEPR in conjunction with a consortium of other European sites, including the Italian site ''LaVoce''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.lavoce.info |title=Economia, Finanza, Politica, Lavoro |language=it |publisher=Lavoce.info |date= |accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which provided inspiration for the idea and help from the start), the French site ''Telos'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telos-eu.com |title=Telos |language=fr |publisher=Telos-eu.com |date=2013-01-04 |accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Spanish site ''Sociedad Abierta'', and the German ''Ökonomenstimme''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oekonomenstimme.org/ |title=Ökonomenstimme: Home |language=de |publisher=Oekonomenstimme.org |date= |accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; VoxEU's stated aim is to "enrich the economic policy debate in Europe and beyond."

VoxEU promotes research-based policy analysis and commentary by "leading economists." The intended audience is economists in governments, international organisations, academia, and the private sector, as well as journalists specializing in economics, finance, and business. The main editors are European economists and economic journalists, including: [[Richard Baldwin (economist)|Richard Baldwin]], [[Tito Boeri]], [[Juan Dolado]], [[Romesh Vaitilingam]], and [[Charles Wyplosz]].

Clive Crook in his blog discusses favorably Vox's contribution to policy debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clivecrook.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/07/all_praise_vox.php |title=All praise Vox, July 24, 2008 |publisher=Clivecrook.theatlantic.com |date=6 March 2012 |accessdate=10 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==
CEPR organises a number of events throughout the year. These can range from open conferences to which anyone can attend, to CEPR members-only meetings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cepr.org/events Events], CEPR&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5085">The '''climate gap''' refers to a body of data indicating disparities in how climate change impacts various racial, ethnic and [[socioeconomic]] groups in the United States. The data show that low [[socioeconomic status]] groups and racial and ethnic minorities will experience more negative health and economic impacts from the results of climate change than other populations in the United States. This term, climate gap, was first used in the May 2009 report, “The Climate Gap: Inequalities in How Climate Change Hurts Americans &amp; How to Close the Gap”,&lt;ref&gt;http://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/242/docs/The_Climate_Gap_Full_Report_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/greenspace/2009/05/global-warming-hurts-poor-people-more.html&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in a concurrent paper published in the journal, ''Environmental Justice'', by Seth B. Shonkoff, Rachel Morello-Frosch and colleagues entitled, "Minding the Climate Gap: Implications of Environmental Health Inequities for Mitigation Policies in California".&lt;ref&gt;Shonkoff SB, Morello-Frosch R, Pastor M, Sadd J. 2009. "Minding the Climate Gap: Implications of Environmental Health Inequities for Mitigation Policies" in ''California Environmental Justice'' '''2'''(4): 173-177.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
'''Disparate health impacts of climate change'''&lt;br /&gt;
Extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts and floods, are expected to increase in their frequency and intensity in the next hundred years due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities are affected by heat-related illness at greater rates due to factors such as lack of access to air conditioning, lack of transportation, occupations that require outdoor work and the heat-island effect in urban neighborhoods.

Higher temperatures resulting from climate change will also increase chemical interactions between nitrogen oxide, volatile organic gases and sunlight, leading to increased concentrations of ambient ozone in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/2007GL031101.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Along with particulate matter, ozone is a primary cause of air pollution-related health effects. Low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities in the United States are more likely to live in areas with dangerous levels of air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://college.usc.edu/geography/ESPE/documents/justice_in_the_air_web.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829091603/http://college.usc.edu/geography/ESPE/documents/justice_in_the_air_web.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This pollution will be exacerbated by climate change, and low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to lack health insurance,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rprogress.org/publications/2006/CARB_Full_0306.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; making them increasingly vulnerable to these elevated levels of air pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;Shonkoff SB, Morello-Frosch R, Pastor M, Sadd J. 2009. Environmental Health and Equity Impacts from Climate Change and Mitigation Policies in California: A Review of the Literature. Publication # CEC-500-2009-038-D. Available at: http://www.climatechange.ca.gov/publications/cat/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

'''Disparate economic impacts of climate change'''&lt;br /&gt;
The proportion of income that low socioeconomic status groups spend on basic necessities such as food, water and energy is already greater than the proportion spent by other populations and is expected to increase as the cost of these necessities increases due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics). 2002. Consumer expenditure
survey. Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, job sectors that employ predominantly low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities such as the agriculture and tourism industries are projected to experience the most dramatic shifts due to climate change, reducing employment opportunities for these populations.&lt;ref&gt;EDD (California Employment Development Department). 2004. Occupational Employment (2002) and Wage (2003) Data, Occupational Employment Statistics Survey Results. Sacramento, California.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, due to the lack of access to insurance and emergency credit, less savings, fewer personal resources and disproportionate hardships from previous economic stress, low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities are likely to suffer the most pronounced and long-lasting economic impacts from climate change-related extreme weather events such as hurricanes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/6/9/9/pages106994/p106994-1.php&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31366">A '''Collections Management System''' ('''CMS'''), sometimes called a '''Collections Information System''', is [[software]] used by the collections staff of a collecting institution or by individual private collectors and collecting hobbyists or enthusiasts.  Collecting institutions are primarily [[museum]]s and [[archive]]s and cover a very broad range from huge, international institutions, to very small or niche-specialty institutions such as local historical museums and preservation societies.  Secondarily, [[libraries]] and [[Art gallery|galleries]] are also collecting institutions.   Collections Management Systems (CMSs) allow individuals or collecting institutions to organize, control, and manage their collections' objects by “tracking all information related to and about” those objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Sully | first=Perian | date=8 July 2006 | url=http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf | title=Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software | publisher=[[John F. Kennedy University]] | page=8 | accessdate=19 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In larger institutions, the CMS may be used by collections staff such as [[Registrar (museum)|registrars]], [[Collection manager|collections managers]], and [[curators]] to record information such as object locations, [[provenance]], curatorial information, conservation reports, professional appraisals, and exhibition histories. All of this recorded information is then also accessed and used by other institutional departments such as “education, membership, accounting, and administration."&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ''MRM5: Museum Registration Methods'' (5th ed.), p. 161. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though early Collections Management Systems were cataloging databases, essentially digital versions of card catalogs, more recent and advanced systems are being used to improve communication between museum staff and to automate and manage collections-based tasks and workflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Swank | first=Annamaria Poma | date=September 2008 | url=http://carlibrary.org/Collection-Management-Systems-Swank.pdf | title=Collections Management Systems | publisher=Carlibrary.org | format=[[PDF]] | page=15 | accessdate=15 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collections Management Systems are also used to provide access to information about an institution's collections and objects to academic researchers, institutional volunteers, and the public, increasingly through online methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Schmitt | first=Bob | date=10 October 2014 | url=http://carlibrary.org/CMS.htm | title=Collection Management Systems | accessdate=15 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many commercially-produced Collections Management Systems are Archivists' Toolkit, Argus, [http://alm.axiell.com/collections-management-software/ Axiell's Collections Management Software], Gallery Systems’ The Museum System (TMS) and EmbARK products, [[PastPerfect Museum Software]], and [http://rediscoverysoftware.com/welcome/ Re:discovery Software's Proficio].&lt;ref&gt;Museum Association of New York.

==Development and history of collections management systems==
Ever since machine-readable standards were developed for libraries in the 1960s, museums have had an interest in utilizing computers to record information about their collections. However, museums have very different needs from libraries; while bibliographic information about a library collection object is usually static, museum records are ever-changing because of the continuous need for new information about museum objects to be added to the records.&lt;ref&gt;Carpinone, Elana C. (May 2010), [http://rcaam.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Graduate-Studies-Thesis-Collections-Management-Elana-Carpinone.pdf Museum Collection Management Systems: One Size Does NOT Fit All], p. 11. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1967, the [[Museum Computer Network]] (MCN), an informal group of New York museums, attempted to create a collections management database called GRIPHOS, and at a [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and [[IBM]] conference in 1968, speakers discussed current and proposed projects to automate collections management.&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006).

Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to coordinate research into developing these systems, professional associations such as the Museum Data Bank Coordinating Committee (MDBCC), formed in 1972, were created to disseminate information about computers and databases to museums interested implementing computerized collections systems.&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006). [http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software]. John F. Kennedy University, p. 29. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, Collections Management Systems became more advanced with the rise of relational databases that “[relate] each piece of data to every other piece,"&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), p. 126. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and during this time some of today’s popular systems were originally developed for specific institutions “based on generic relational databases” — such as Gallery Systems' The Museum System for the Metropolitan Museum of Art and [http://rediscoverysoftware.com/welcome/ Re:discovery Software's Proficio] for the Thomas Jefferson Foundation’s [[Monticello]] — before being released as commercial products.&lt;ref&gt;Carpinone, Elana C. (May 2010), [http://rcaam.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Graduate-Studies-Thesis-Collections-Management-Elana-Carpinone.pdf Museum Collection Management Systems: One Size Does NOT Fit All], p. 19. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, with computers becoming faster and cheaper and with the rise of the Internet, collections management software became much more sophisticated, able to “present images, sort information in any one of a myriad of configurations, record exhibition information, track locations, and interface with a museum Website."&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006). [http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software]. John F. Kennedy University, p. 40. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the goal during the 1960s was to use computers for collections record-keeping for purposes of accountability, MCN Executive Director [[Everett Ellin]] warned that museum professionals should include public access as a goal because it would “not be worth the effort if museums only create a glorified record-keeping system."&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006). [http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software]. John F. Kennedy University, p. 26. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Collections Management Systems have become crucial tools in increasing public access to collections information, expanding the types of information that are recorded. What was once “a simple tool for collections care and inventory” has become “a robust and powerful instrument for saving all information about museum objects," including interpretive material, digital objects, and digital surrogates. Since some Collections Management Systems now incorporate [[Digital asset management|Digital Asset Management]] and content information storage, many museum professionals have started to use the acronym CMS to stand for “[[Content management system|Content Management System]]."&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006).

Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information managed in collections management systems==
In 1997, art historian and museum information studies consultant Robert A. Baron outlined the requirements for Collections Management Systems, not as a list of the kinds of collections object information that should be recorded, but rather as a list of collections activities such as administration, loan, exhibition, preservation, and retrieval,&lt;ref&gt;Swank, Annamaria Poma (September 2008).

Retrieved 15 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Heritage Information Network]] (CHIN) Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist (CMSCC), which aims to be a comprehensive list of the kinds of information that a museum may want to record in a CMS, organizes that list by processes and actions rather than type of information. The checklist “outlines a number of features commonly included in a commercial CMS, which can assist a museum in determining which features have priority.”&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012).

===Object entry===
Managing and documenting information and tasks related to objects entering the museum, including acquisition or loan records, receipts, record of the reason for the deposit of the object, and record of the object’s return to its owner.

===Acquisition===
The management and documentation of objects added to the institution’s collection, including [[Accession number (library science)|accession numbers]], catalog numbers, object name or title, acquisition date, acquisition method, and transfer of title. There are many different accession numbering systems, and a CMS should allow an institution to use its existing numbering system.&lt;ref&gt;Carpinone, Elana C. (May 2010), [http://rcaam.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Graduate-Studies-Thesis-Collections-Management-Elana-Carpinone.pdf Museum Collection Management Systems: One Size Does NOT Fit All], p. 26. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inventory control===
Identification of objects for which the institution has a legal responsibility, including loaned objects and objects that have not been accessioned. Information recorded includes object location and status.

===Location and movement control===
Records of an object’s current and past locations within the institution's premises so that it can be located, including dates of movement and authorizations for movement.

===Catalog description===
Information that describes and identifies objects, including creator/maker/artist, date(s) of creation, place of creation, provenance, object history, research on the object, and connections to other objects.

===Conservation management===
The management of information about an object’s conservation “from a curatorial and [[Collections management (museum)|collections management]] perspective," including conservation requests, examination records, condition reports, records of preventative actions, and treatment histories.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012).

Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk management===

Management of information about potential threats to collections objects, including documentation of specific threats, records of preventative measures, disaster plans and procedures, and emergency contacts.

===Insurance management and valuation control===

Documentation of insurance needs for objects for which the institution is responsible (included loaned objects) as well as the monetary value of objects for insurance purposes. This may include the names and contact information of appraisers as well as appraisal history.

===Exhibition management===
Management of an object’s exhibition or display, including exhibition history and documentation of research done on an object for an exhibition. More advanced Collections Management Systems may have the ability to present information from the system on a museum’s website or in an online exhibit.

===Dispatch/shipping/transport===
Management of objects leaving the institution’s premises and being transferred to a different location, including location information, packing notes, crate dimensions, authorizations, customs information and documenting the means of transportation (including courier information).&lt;ref&gt;Carpinone, Elana C. (May 2010), [http://rcaam.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Graduate-Studies-Thesis-Collections-Management-Elana-Carpinone.pdf Museum Collection Management Systems: One Size Does NOT Fit All], p. 26.

Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features of collections management systems==

===Functionality===

A Collections Management System should be able to store data, edit data, delete data, access data through queries, sort data, and output data in the form of reports.&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), pp. 117-118. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Data is stored in the form of tables and is entered into the system (and sometimes edited) using forms. Queries are searches that help retrieve specific data from the system, and reports “are the means by which the results of a query are displayed or printed."&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 162. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flexibility===
An efficient CMS, like a good relational database, should not have duplicate records and should not require that the same information be recorded in more than one place in the system. At the same time, the system should be flexible enough to accommodate more data as the collections expand.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 162. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; The user must also understand that not all information must be entered into a Collections Management System; for example, complex information such as complicated dimensions and measurements. Some institutions may not want to record confidential information such as private donor information in a CMS and instead keep it in a manual file or a separate, secure digital file, with pointers to the file’s location recorded in the CMS.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 169. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; However, others argue that such confidential information should be recorded in the CMS to protect the information in the event of a disaster where manual files may be destroyed.

===Backup and redundancy===
A CMS should have "a built in backup and recovery process" to protect data against not only equipment failure and disaster but also human error, which may result in loss or corruption of data. Redundant copies of the information should be stored in multiple locations, and the backup process may be automated.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012). [http://www.rcip-chin.gc.ca/carrefour-du-savoir-knowledge-exchange/criteres_gestion_collections_management_checklist-eng.jsp Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist – 2012]. Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data standards===
Because a computerized system “demands a much greater degree of precision in the use of language for cataloging and data retrieval than does a manual system,” data and [[metadata standards]] should be applied in a Collections Management System.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 173. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;  Data standards provide rules for how information is entered into the system, and data that has been entered into the system in a consistent manner allows for more accurate and precise [[information retrieval]] and for easier exchange of data between different systems.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 172. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three types of data standards are structure, content, and value:

* Data structure standards describe the fields and categories of information (sometimes called elements) that are required to identify an object. In a museum CMS, these fields often include accession number, title/name of object, maker/creator of object, place of creation/origin, date of creation, dimensions, material, and source of object (for example, name of donor or seller).&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), p. 122. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of widely used data structure standards used for cultural objects are the [[Dublin Core]] Metadata Element Set (DC), [[Categories for the Description of Works of Art]] (CDWA), the [[MARC standards|MARC]] formats, the element sets of Cataloging of Cultural Objects (CCO), and the VRA ([[Visual Resources Association]]) Core Categories.&lt;ref&gt;Zeng, Marcia Lei;Qin, Jian. (2008). Chapter 2: Current Standards. In ‘’Metadata’’ (pp.15-32). New York, NY: Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Data content standards provide guidelines for the formatting of information being entered into the fields, “controlling the syntax, style, grammar, and abbreviations” that should be used.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 172. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of data content standards used in institutions that collect cultural objects include Cataloging of Cultural Objects (CCO) and [[Describing Archives: A Content Standard]] (DACS).
* Data value standards provide the preferred terms and vocabulary to be used in the fields, often in the form of [[authority lists]], lexicons, [[Data Dictionaries|data dictionaries]], and thesauri. Examples include the Getty’s [[Art and Architecture Thesaurus]] (AAT) and [[Thesaurus of Geographic Names]] (TGN), Nomenclature 4.0 for Museum Cataloguing, and [[Iconclass]].&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), pp. 175-176. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;
While most of these data standards apply to the cataloging and description of cultural objects, efforts are also being made to create data standards for natural history collections. Based on Dublin Core, the [[Darwin Core]] standard is a data structure standard for biodiversity information whose “glossary of terms” are the “fields” and “elements” needed to catalog biological and natural history specimens and samples.&lt;ref&gt;Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG). [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/ Darwin Core]. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognizing the importance of data standards to many users, some developers advertise that their Collections Management Systems are compliant with certain standards. For example, the Adlib Museum CMS is “certified as SPECTRUM compliant by the Collections Trust” and “also incorporates other international standards such as the ‘[[CIDOC]]’ guidelines and Getty ‘Object ID.’”&lt;ref&gt;Adlib Software. [http://www.adlibsoft.com/products/museum-collection-management-software Adlib Museum]. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security and access===
A Collections Management System should have security measures that “ensure that only authorized persons are able to enter, edit, or view” information contained in the system.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 162. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a growing demand for public access to some of the collections and object information contained in the CMS, which “helps fulfill a museum's mission to educate the public and prove that the objects held in public trust are used to public benefit” while also encouraging collections staff to “support basic collection stewardship” by ensuring that information about the object is accurate before being made publicly accessible.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 182. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; The system should allow the public to be able to make and refine searches of publicly accessible information in the system.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012).

Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights and reproductions===

A CMS should also allow collections staff to manage information on reproduction rights of the objects for which the institution is responsible, including type of copyright scheme being applied (for example, U.S. copyright or [[Creative Commons license]]), copyright ownership, and digital watermarks.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012).

Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Considerations when selecting a system==
Since every museum has different needs, a museum should make a [[needs assessment]] before selecting a Collections Management System. The museum should determine what collections processes it needs the system to manage.&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), p. 118. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum should also identify who will be using the system and consider such factors as collection size (both present and future), staff technology skills, and budget/pricing.&lt;ref&gt;Kozak, Zenobia (Jan-Feb 2013), [https://www.historyassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-AAM-Jan-Feb-Museum-Mag-Article-Reprint.pdf How Do We Select a Collections Management System?] ‘’MUSEUM’’. American Association of Museums,. Retrieved 13 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Another recommendation is to map out both the short- and long-term goals for the new CMS and then determine how the system can help increase the museum's efficiencies. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historyassociates.com/resources/blog/select-museum-cms-start-with-needs-assessment/|title=Start Your Museum CMS Selection Process with a Needs Assessment |publisher=HistoryAssociates.com |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation information management systems==
Collections Management Systems have their origins in cataloging and registration, and consequently, most systems manage information and records “from a curatorial and collections management perspective."&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012). [http://www.rcip-chin.gc.ca/carrefour-du-savoir-knowledge-exchange/criteres_gestion_collections_management_checklist-eng.jsp Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist – 2012]. Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation information in these systems is often limited to condition reporting and documentation of treatment history. While some advanced systems allow registrars to manage workflow tasks such as approvals and receipts, most systems are unable to manage conservation workflows. Many conservators also need a system that can not only store and manage conservation documentation but also easily share that information with other conservators and institutions.

Many Collections Management System developers have responded to this need by adding requested conservation features to their products. For example, in 2009, Gallery Systems, the developer of The Museum System (TMS), formed a consortium of stakeholders called the Conservation Working Group, to create a set of features to add to the conservation module of TMS.&lt;ref&gt;Gallery Systems (2015). [http://www.gallerysystems.com/a-brief-history-of-conservation-studio/ A Brief History of Conservation Studio]. Retrieved 23 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some conservators and institutions have taken a different approach, customizing existing software so that the system can manage conservation workflows. For example, at the [[Smithsonian National Postal Museum]] in 2012, former collections database administrator Kate Collen modified The Museum Systems’ conservation module so that it could manage object treatment processes, including assigning roles and responsibilities to multiple staff, ordering and prioritizing conservation tasks and treatments, separating treatment images from object images, automating registrar and lender approvals for treatments, and even tracking staff hours. This was achieved by renaming and remapping fields in the existing system, in some cases using fields for different purposes than originally intended by the software developer.&lt;ref&gt;Collen, Kate (2012). [https://www.dropbox.com/s/4vsnd3jf5g7rssr/Collen%2C%20Kate%20%282012%29.%20Making%20Conservation%20Work.pdf?dl=0 Making Conservation Work: Configuring the Conservation Module for the Smithsonian National Postal Museum]. Retrieved 14, November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some software developers have been developing standalone systems specifically for the purpose of managing conservation information and tasks. Since 2000, Inventive Software Solutions has been developing the Conservation Tracker System for the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] to be “a comprehensive digital management tool for art conservation documentation.”&lt;ref&gt;Inventive Software Solutions. [http://www.inventivesoftware.net/Products/ConservationTracker.aspx Conservation Tracker System Overview]. Retrieved 23 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Developed since 2009 as a program of the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], ConservationSpace is a project “to develop an open-source software application that will address a core need of the conservation community for a shared solution to the problem of documentation management.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservationspace.org/Home.html ConservationSpace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219041630/http://conservationspace.org/Home.html |date=2014-12-19 }}. Retrieved 23 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Gallery Systems decided that adding incremental conservation features to The Museum System was no longer sufficient to meet the needs of conservators and began to develop a standalone web-based system to manage conservation processes called TMS Conservation Studio, which was released in summer of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Gallery Systems.

The '''conservation of taxidermy''' is the ongoing maintenance and preservation of zoological specimens that have been mounted or stuffed for display and study. [[Taxidermy]] specimens contain a variety of organic materials, such as fur, bone, feathers, skin, and wood, as well as inorganic materials, such as burlap, glass, and foam. Due to their composite nature, taxidermy specimens require special care and conservation treatments for the different materials.

== Types and uses ==
[[File:Common Blackbird at BNHS.jpg|thumb|Example of a study skin]]
[[File:White Memorial Conservation Center 12 - museum display about taxidermy.jpg|thumb|Display with different examples of support forms]]
Traditional [[taxidermy]] specimens are cleaned and preserved animal skins that have been mounted over a form.&lt;ref name=1natsca&gt;NatSCA. Taxidermy and Skins. Retrieved from http://www.natsca.org/taxidermy&lt;/ref&gt; Full mounts are the entire specimen, while shoulder mounts only include the head, neck, and shoulders. Study skins are another form of taxidermy in which the skins of small mammals and birds are stuffed with cotton, wool, or synthetic fibers in order to support the skin and original body shape.&lt;ref name=2vertebrates&gt;Carter, D. &amp; Walker, A. K. (1999). Chapter 1: Vertebrates. Care and Conservation of Natural History Collections. Retrieved from http://www.natsca.org/care-and-conservation&lt;/ref&gt; These are typically used by researchers rather than put on display.

Taxidermy has a robust [[History of taxidermy|history]], and specimens can be found in a number of public and private institutions, as well as personal collections. Natural history museums, zoos, science &amp; nature centers, historic houses, art museums, and children’s museums are examples of institutions that may have taxidermy specimens in their collections.&lt;ref name=3trophies&gt;Troublesome Trophies and Fragile Feathered Friends: Introduction to the Care of Historic Taxidermy webinar. Retrieved from http://www.connectingtocollections.org/troublesome-trophies-and-fragile-feathered-friends-introduction-to-the-care-of-historic-taxidermy/&lt;/ref&gt;

While it may not be necessary to conserve mounts or skins of commonly occurring animals beyond educational use,&lt;ref name=4handbook&gt;National Park Service Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections. Retrieved from https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/mushbkI.html&lt;/ref&gt; some taxidermy mounts represent extinct or critically endangered species. The Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History houses Martha, the last [[passenger pigeon]] and a some collections still have [[Great Auk]] specimens, a bird species that went extinct in 1844.&lt;ref name=1natsca /&gt;

== Causes of deterioration ==
As with other types of collections, taxidermy specimens are susceptible to agents of deterioration, including pests, lights, temperature, humidity, and custodial neglect. Improper storage, display, and handling of taxidermy specimens can lead to many of these causes of deterioration.&lt;ref name=3trophies /&gt;

=== Pest damage ===
Pests, such as [[Dermestid Beetle|dermestid beetles]], clothes moths, and rodents, can cause damage to taxidermy specimens by eating materials and leaving larvae husks behind. Dermestid beetles in particular can digest keratin and will feed on hair, horns, and feathers.&lt;ref name=4handbook /&gt; Signs of a pest infestation in taxidermy include small piles of dust (known as frass) underneath a specimen and shedding skin from growing larvae.&lt;ref name=5natsca&gt;NatSCA and ICON. Care and Conservation of Zoological Specimens. Retrieved from http://natsca.org/sites/default/files/publications-full/care-and-conservation-of-zoological-specimens.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Additional signs of an infestation include chewing marks, loss of hair, fur, or feathers on mounts, webbing, and fecal pellets or stains.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service Conserve O Gram. Identifying Museum Insect Pest Damage. Retrieved from https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/03-11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental damage ===

==== Pollutants ====
Over time, taxidermy specimens can accumulate layers of dust, dirt, and other airborne pollutants, especially if they are house on open shelving or display. Additionally, cases and containers made of unstable materials can off gas pollutants, such as H2s, SO2, formaldehyde, peroxides, and organic acids, which can damage the surfaces of taxidermy.&lt;ref name=7standards&gt;Standards in the Care of Skins and Taxidermy Collections. Retrieved from http://conservation.myspecies.info/node/32&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Light ====
Fading of fur, feathers, and skins is almost exclusively caused by improper lighting conditions, such as long-term exposure to [[Ultraviolet light|ultraviolet (UV) light]]. UV light can come from both natural and artificial lighting sources.

==== Temperature ====
Specimens may lose fur or feathers when exposed to warm environments because the high temperature causes residual fats in skins to release.&lt;ref name=5natsca /&gt;

==== Humidity ====
Taxidermy specimens are especially susceptible to fluctuations in humidity due to their composite materials. Relative humidity fluctuations below 40% can cause greater damage than fluctuations above 40%.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt; Dry environments with low humidity may cause de-lamination or cracking in horns, bones, and turtle shells. Additionally, dry environments can cause skins and leathers to contract and shrink over the support form, which eventually leads to cracking and splitting. High humidity and moist environments can promote mold growth and attract pests. Bones will contract and swell due to humidity fluctuations, which may lead to cracking and splitting.&lt;ref name=5natsca /&gt; This may lead to further structural damage if the bones are used as support within the specimen.

=== Damage caused by humans ===

==== Improper handling ====
Breakage of appendages is likely to occur if specimens are not properly handled. Bird specimens are especially susceptible to breaking at the neck,&lt;ref name=3trophies /&gt; while mammals’ ears tend to be the first component to break or become disfigured.

==== Packing and shipping ====
Given their unique shape and form, taxidermy specimens can be difficult to ship and if not packed properly, can be easily damaged. Ears, necks, and birds’ beaks can break or bend during shipment if not properly supported.&lt;ref name=2vertebrates /&gt;

==== Theft and vandalism ====
[[File:Stolen Rhinoceros horn 2.jpg|thumb|Rhinoceros specimen with missing horn due to theft]]
Some taxidermy specimens are vulnerable to direct damage by humans, especially if the species is associated with a valuable body part. Thieves may opt to take only part of a taxidermy specimen, which can impact the structural integrity of the entire specimen.

=== Inherent vice ===
Sometimes taxidermy specimens are susceptible to damage that is difficult to avoid and inherent to the nature of taxidermy. Metals, such as nickel and copper, used in support structures and forms can react to fatty acids in skins and cause corrosion.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt; Gravity can also negatively impact taxidermy specimens by pulling unsupported components, such as tails and horns, away from the main structure, thus causing tears and breaks.&lt;ref name=3trophies /&gt; Gravitational damage typically occurs with specimens on display, where support structures are not part of a diorama or case. However, hanging study skins in storage experience a gravitational pull that causes stretching and tearing of the skins.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt;

== Hazardous materials in taxidermy ==
Before extensive handling, hands-on display use &lt;ref name=4handbook /&gt; or conservation treatments are carried out, it is important to test taxidermy specimens for hazardous materials. [[Arsenic]], mercury, [[napthalene]], paradichlorobenze, [[asbestos]], and [[DDT]] are all commonly found in taxidermy collections.&lt;ref name=4handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=8pesticides&gt;American Museum of Natural History. Residual Pesticides. Retrieved from http://www.amnh.org/our-research/natural-science-collections-conservation/general-conservation/health-safety/residual-pesticides&lt;/ref&gt; These chemicals were used to treat skins during preparation and helped reduce mold and pest damage. However, they can cause serious health concerns and illness in humans. Conservators may test for the presence of these hazardous materials in order to determine the appropriate course of treatment. In addition to testing, conservators may also review museum records, inspect specimens, or examine storage areas to determine what hazardous materials may be present.&lt;ref name=8pesticides /&gt;

== Conservation and restoration treatments ==
Treatments should be carried out by conservators or qualified taxidermists. Some taxidermists have experience working with museums and can coordinate with conservators to preserve specimens. When cleaning specimens, it is necessary to wear protective gear such as nitrile gloves, dust masks, eye protection, and lab coats.

=== Basic cleaning ===
Taxidermy specimens can gather dirt and dust over time and may only need basic remedial treatments to be conserved. Basic cleaning can be done on a regular basis to help keep specimens in good condition.

==== Fur ==== 
[[File:Taxidermied tiger head, Natural History Museum, Berlin, Germany - 20101107.jpg|thumb|Example of fur on a tiger specimen]]
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of fur objects}}
[[Fur]] may be gently cleaned with a soft-bristled brush or comb, which will help loosen particulates that have built up. A vacuum with a soft brush attachment will also work to remove dust and dirt.	For particularly dirty furs, conservators may opt to wash the specimen’s fur with water and a mild detergent or soap. If a mount has been exposed to fire and is covered with fine soot, a smoke sponge may be used to wipe down the fur. Some taxidermists promote cleaning of fur with furniture polish, however, this method will cause wax to build up and eventually dull the color of the fur.&lt;ref name=9carolina&gt;Carolina Conservation blog. Cleaning Taxidermy. Retrieved from https://carolinaconservation.wordpress.com/tag/cleaning-taxidermy/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Feathers ====
[[File:Ardea cinerea - Museum fur Naturkunde, Berlin - DSC00189.JPG|thumb|A variety of feathers are present on some bird specimens (Great Blue Heron pictured)]]
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of feathers}}
Dust and dirt can accumulate feathers and can be cleaned manually. The preferred methods are gentle brushing with a soft bristled brush or pinpoint vacuuming through a screen. These methods will leave the feathers in good condition in their natural alignment. However, solvents may be needed to clean feathers if dust is held in place by grease, which can leach out of skins. Distilled water may be used if dry methods fail, but more stubborn dust may need to be cleaned with non-denatured 70% ethanol. However, solvents may strip natural oils in feathers and leave them brittle.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, S. (1996). Cleaning Mounted Birds. Retrieved from http://cool.conservation-us.org/byform/mailing-lists/cdl/1996/1168.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Skin ====
Exposed skin on a mount, such as noses, mouths, or birds’ feet, may be cleaned with a soft microfiber cloth or brush. Some birds’ feet may be artificially colored and will not react well if solvents are applied.&lt;ref name=9carolina /&gt;

==== Bone, horns and antler objects ====
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of bone, horn, and antler objects}}
Horns that are starting to crack may be treated with conservation-grade beeswax polish that will help protect against dehydration.&lt;ref name=5natsca /&gt; Beaks are another component of taxidermy specimens that are typically artificially colored and should only be cleaned with brushes and soft clothes.&lt;ref name=9carolina /&gt;

==== Glass components ====
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of glass objects}}
Taxidermy specimens have glass eyes that can be gently cleaned with glass cleaner.&lt;ref name=9carolina /&gt;

=== Repair and restoration techniques ===
If a taxidermy specimen has been significantly damaged, conservators may have to use more thorough and sometimes invasive techniques to restore them. These techniques can help to stabilize the specimen's condition while also restoring the appearance to be more scientifically accurate. Before undertaking any repairs, conservators use a variety of imaging techniques, such as photography and x-rays, to get a good idea of the structure and level of damage of the specimen.

==== Structural repair ====
Fill materials may be used on taxidermy specimens to correct areas of loss. It is important that the specimen is in stable condition because many fill materials have drawbacks that can further damage the specimen.  Fills typically consist of a backing made of inert fabric combined with a resin, starch, or cellulose ether.&lt;ref&gt;Nieuwenhuizen, L. (1998). Synthetic Fill Materials for Skins, Leathers, and Furs. Retrieved from http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic37-01-010.html&lt;/ref&gt; For example, bird specimens that have been badly damaged by pests may be repaired with a mixture of synthetic fabrics and wheat starch. This mixture is used to infill areas of loss and feathers are replaced where possible with a wheat starch paste adhesive. In addition to infilling, taxidermy specimens may require structural repairs. Small specimens that have experienced loss of a head or appendage, a new wire armature may be inserted into the specimen in order to remount the broken piece. Adhesive can be used to further secure the broken piece to its original body.&lt;ref&gt;Horniman Museum and Gardens. Conserving Our Taxidermy. Retrieved from http://www.horniman.ac.uk/collections/conserving-our-taxidermy&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Recoloring fur ====
A relatively recent development in taxidermy restoration, metal complex dyes have been used to recolor fur. The [[American Museum of Natural History]] performed extensive research and tests using these dyes to recolor the furs of taxidermy specimens during the restoration of the Hall of North American Mammals. Many of the dyes have a high lightfastness and are more resistant to fading. When applied to fur, they also allow for a more natural look and feel. Another major benefit to using dyes, as opposed to acrylic paints, to recolor fur is they are reversible. The dyes can be reduced or entirely removed with application of ethanol. Research is still being done into the dyes’ lightfastness and fixability, as well as whether or not they cause the fur to degrade over time.&lt;ref name=13true&gt;In Their True Colors blog. A Horse of a Different Color: Researching Colorants for Recoloring Taxidermy. Retrieved from https://intheirtruecolors.wordpress.com/category/renovation-of-the-bernard-family-hall-of-north-american-mammals/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Diorama repair ====
3D printing is a newer method being used to replace foliage in some dioramas because it can quickly replicate hundreds of leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Yale University. 3D Printing: Restoring Museum Dioramas. Retrieved from http://dmca.yalecollege.yale.edu/news/3d-printing-restoring-museum-exhibitions&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pest treatments ====
Pests may be treated with a number of methods, including freezing, insecticide, or anoxia.&lt;ref name=5natsca /&gt; These treatments help kill off adults and larvae, though specimens may require additional cleaning and stabilization after these treatments are performed.

== Preventative care and maintenance ==
In order to prolong the life of a taxidermy specimen, it is necessary for museums and conservators to implement [[Collections care|preventative care]] and maintenance strategies. These strategies help protect specimens from damage caused by humidity, temperature, pests, humans, and more.

=== Proper storage and display conditions ===
One of the most effective ways to prevent damage from occurring to taxidermy collections is to establish a monitoring system or procedure that routinely checks the condition of specimens.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt; When not on display, taxidermy specimens should be housed in well-sealed cabinets or cases. Metal cabinets may be made of aluminum and/or stainless steel with an epoxy powder coating and are effective at preventing pest and light damage. Wood cabinets can provide better protection from fluctuations in relative humidity, though they off-gas chemicals that may damage collections.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt; Though it is essential for cabinets and cases to be well-sealed, they should also allow for minimal airflow to prevent off-gassed chemicals or humidity from building up inside the container. For taxidermy specimens housed on open shelving, a polythene sheet can provide temporary protection from pollutants, though dust may accumulate electrostatically (2).
Controlled lighting conditions with UV filters are important for reducing fading in taxidermy specimens.&lt;ref name=13true /&gt; Specimens should be regularly rotated in order to reduce light damage. 50-100 lux is the recommended light exposure for taxidermy, though some types of feathers are susceptible to damage at 50 lux.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt; The maximum annual exposure levels for biological specimens, feathers, fur, and leather is 180,000 lux hours.&lt;ref name=4handbook /&gt; In the span of one year, a taxidermy mount will fade half as much if displayed in low light compared to the same conditions in high light.&lt;ref name=4handbook /&gt; 
Ideal relative humidity conditions for taxidermy specimens are 40% minimum and 55% maximum.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt; An [[Museum integrated pest management|integrated pest management system]] is important to manage and monitor pests that can damage collections.

=== Proper handling ===
Proper handling techniques are essential to protect specimens from damage. Conservators will inspect taxidermy specimens for signs of weakness or detachable parts before moving the object. It is important for anyone handling taxidermy to remove jewelry, such as watches, rings, or bracelets, that may scratch or snag parts of the specimen. If the taxidermy specimen is mounted on a base or in a tray, it is preferred to only handle the base or tray while moving the object, rather than the specimen itself. Conservators will also use a secondary support, such as padding, to support the taxidermy specimen while in transit.&lt;ref&gt;American Museum of Natural History. Specimen Handling Checklist. Retrieved from http://www.amnh.org/our-research/natural-science-collections-conservation/general-conservation/preventive-conservation&lt;/ref&gt; Wearing nitrile gloves while handling specimens will help prevent oil and perspiration transfer.&lt;ref name=5natsca /&gt;

=== Packing and shipping ===
Bases of taxidermy mounts should be affixed to a shipping container with screws, straps, staples or tapes, with light and loose packing materials supporting the specimen’s structure.&lt;ref name=2vertebrates /&gt; This keeps the specimen stable during shipment, and informs the receiver which way the specimen is oriented within the container. Additionally, polystyrene or polyethylene bags may be used to cover taxidermy specimens during shipment.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt;

== Notable Examples ==
=== American Museum of Natural History mammal hall ===
[[File:Alaska Moose at the American Museum of Natural History.jpg|thumb|Alaska moose diorama at the American Museum of Natural History in 2012, after restoration]]
In 2011-2012, the [[American Museum of Natural History]] undertook the restoration of 43 dioramas in its Bernard Family Hall of North American Mammals. In addition to repairing mounts, conservators worked on restoring the dioramas’ set pieces and background paintings.&lt;ref&gt;American Museum of Natural History. Bernard Family Hall of North American Mammals. Retrieved from http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/mammal-halls/bernard-family-hall-of-north-american-mammals&lt;/ref&gt; In order to restore the taxidermy mounts and specimens, conservators removed smaller animals from the dioramas and built temporary scaffolding around larger animals, such as the 500-pound bison. Many of the larger mounts are affixed to their diorama case and could not easily be moved without risking further damage. One of the main goals of the project was to bring back scientific accuracy to the specimens, including their fur coloring. The museum’s conservators tested and developed a new method of treatment for recoloring furs that uses metal dyes instead of traditional materials, such as paints and hair dyes. Other details of specimens were updated and restored - the cougar’s whiskers were replaced with porcupine quills to give the face a fuller appearance and veins were added to the antelope jackrabbit’s ears to give a realistic appearance. In order to protect the restored taxidermy specimens and dioramas, UV-filtered lights were installed throughout the mammal hall.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific America. New Technology for Old Dioramas. Retrieved from https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-technology-old-dioramas/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Postal Museum’s "Owney"===
[[File:OwneyDog.jpg|thumb|Owney, before treatments]]
In 2011, the Smithsonian’s National Postal Museum restored its beloved “Owney”, the canine mascot of the Railway Mail Service. Owney was taxidermied in 1987 and had undergone previous restoration attempts. Using new methods and treatments, conservators removed dust, built-up wax, paint, and traces of arsenic. They also reshaped his face to be more accurate based on photographic evidence, as well as replaced his vest with a more accurate leather harness. As a result of the restoration, Owney’s fur is fuller, his tail is fluffier, and he has a more historically accurate appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Postal Museum Blog.

===Napoleon’s Horse "Vizir"===
Almost 200 years old, Vizir was one of Napoleon Bonaparte’s horses, and its mount has been on display at the Musee de l’Armee in Paris. The horse was showing significant signs of deterioration and a campaign was launched to fund its restoration. Conservators and taxidermists worked to rehydrate the skin, repair tears in the body, and restore coloration to the fur. Once the treatments were completed, Vizir was placed in a climate-controlled case to prevent further deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;Hyperallergic. Taxidermists Restore Napoleon’s Beloved White Horse.

===Henry the Elephant===
The Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History revamped its main rotunda in 2015, and restored its centerpiece elephant, Henry, which has been on display since 1959. Previous restorations have been performed, including one in the 1970s that involved replacing the tusks with fiberglass replicas to reduce stress on the specimen. The elephant was dusted and vacuumed to remove debris, then waxes were used to infill cracks and make other repairs. The skin was retextured and recolored to more closely resemble an elephant hide.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post. How a Museum Gives an Elephant a Facelift.

{{double image|right|Perfect octave on C.png|175|Minor second on C.png|175|The [[perfect octave]], a consonant interval {{audio|Perfect octave on C.mid|Play}}|The [[minor second]], a dissonance {{audio|Minor second on C.mid|Play}}|A consonance|A dissonance}}

In music, '''consonance''' and '''dissonance''' are categorizations of simultaneous or successive sounds. Consonance is associated with sweetness, pleasantness, and acceptability; dissonance is associated with harshness, unpleasantness, or unacceptability.

The terms form a structural dichotomy in which they define each other by mutual exclusion: a consonance is what is not dissonant, and a dissonance is what is not consonant. However, a finer consideration shows that the distinction forms a gradation, from the most consonant to the most dissonant. As Hindemith stressed, "The two concepts have never been completely explained, and for a thousand years the definitions have varied" {{harv|Hindemith|1942|p=85}}.

The opposition can be made in different contexts:
*In [[acoustics]] or psychophysiology, the distinction may be objective. In modern times, it usually is based on the perception of harmonic partials of the sounds considered, to such an extent that the distinction really holds only in the case of harmonic sounds (i.e. sounds with [[harmonic partial]]s).
*In music, even if the opposition often is founded on the preceding, objective distinction, it more often is subjective, conventional, cultural, and style- and/or period-dependent. Dissonance can then be defined as a combination of sounds that does not belong to the style under consideration; in recent music, what is considered stylistically dissonant may even correspond to what is said to be consonant in the context of acoustics (e.g. a major triad in 20th century [[atonal music]]). A major second (e.g. the notes C and D played simultaneously) would be considered dissonant if it occurred in a [[J.S. Bach]] prelude from the 1700s; however, the same interval may sound consonant in the context of a [[Claude Debussy]] piece from the early 1900s or an atonal contemporary piece.

In both cases, the distinction mainly concerns simultaneous sounds; if successive sounds are considered, their consonance or dissonance depends on the memorial retention of the first sound while the second sound (or pitch) is heard. For this reason, consonance and dissonance have been considered particularly in the case of Western [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] music, and the present article is concerned mainly with this case. Most historical definitions of consonance and dissonance since about the 16th century have stressed their pleasant/unpleasant, or agreeable/disagreeable character. This may be justifiable in a psychophysiological context, but much less in a musical context properly speaking: dissonances often play a decisive role in making music pleasant, even in a generally consonant context—which is one of the reasons why the musical definition of consonance/dissonance cannot match the psychophysiologic definition. In addition, the oppositions pleasant/unpleasant or agreeable/disagreeable evidence a confusion between the concepts of "dissonance" and of "[[noise]]". (See also [[Noise in music]], [[Noise music]] and [[Noise (acoustic)]].)

While consonance and dissonance exist only between sounds and therefore necessarily describe intervals (or [[chord (music)|chord]]s), such as the [[perfect interval]]s, which are often viewed as consonant (e.g., the [[unison (music)|unison]] and [[octave]]), Occidental [[music theory]] often considers that, in a dissonant chord, one of the tones alone is in itself deemed to be the dissonance: it is this tone in particular that needs "resolution" through a specific [[voice leading]] procedure. For example, in the key of C Major, if F is produced as part of the [[dominant seventh]] chord (G&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, which consists of the pitches G, B, D and F), it is deemed to be "dissonant" and it normally resolves to E during a cadence, with the G&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; chord changing to a C Major chord.

==Consonance==
Consonances may include:
*'''Perfect consonances''':
**[[unison]]s and [[octave]]s
**[[perfect fourth]]s and [[perfect fifth]]s
*'''Imperfect consonances''':

The definition of consonance has been variously based on experience, frequency, and both physical and psychological considerations {{harv|Myers|1904|p=315}}. These include:
*[[Frequency]] ratios: with ratios of lower simple numbers being more consonant than those that are higher ([[Pythagoras]]{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;!--Nothing in the list of sources with this name.--&gt;). Many of these definitions do not require ''exact'' integer tunings, only approximation.{{vague|date=July 2014}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}
*''Coincidence of partials'': with consonance being a greater coincidence of [[Harmonic series (music)|partial]]s ({{harvnb|Helmholtz|1954 [1877]}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}). By this definition, consonance is dependent not only on the width of the interval between two notes (i.e., the [[musical tuning]]), but also on the combined spectral distribution and thus sound quality (i.e., the [[timbre]]) of the notes (see the entry under [[critical band]]). Thus, a note and the note one octave higher are highly consonant because the partials of the higher note are also partials of the lower note {{harv|Roederer|1995|p=165}}. Although Helmholtz's work focused almost exclusively on harmonic timbres and also the tunings, subsequent work has generalized his findings to embrace non-harmonic tunings and timbres ({{harvnb|Sethares|1992}}; {{harvnb|Sethares|2005}}{{Failed verification|date=February 2016}}&lt;!--The book does not include the expression "non-harmonic"!--&gt; {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}; {{harvnb|Milne, Sethares, and Plamondon|2007}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}; {{harvnb|Milne, Sethares, and Plamondon|2008}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}; {{harvnb|Sethares et al.|2009}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}).
*Fusion: perception of unity or tonal fusion between two notes ({{harvnb|Stumpf|1890|pp=127–219}}; {{harvnb|Butler and Green|2002|p=264}}).

==Dissonance==
[[File:Krenek's chord classification from Studies in Counterpoint.png|thumb|350px|right|[[Ernst Krenek]]'s classification, from ''Studies in Counterpoint'' (1940), of a triad's overall consonance or dissonance through the consonance or dissonance of the three intervals contained within {{harv|Schuijer|2008|p=138}} {{audio|Krenek's chord classification from Studies in Counterpoint.mid|Play}}. For example, C-E-G consists of three consonances (C-E, E-G, C-G) and is ranked 1 while C-D{{music|♭}}-B consists of one mild dissonance (B-D{{music|♭}}) and two sharp dissonances (C-D{{music|♭}}, C-B) and is ranked 6.]]
{{quote|An unstable tone combination is a dissonance; its tension demands an onward motion to a stable chord. Thus dissonant chords are "active"; traditionally they have been considered harsh and have expressed pain, grief, and conflict.|Roger {{harvtxt|Kamien|2008|p=41}}}}

In Western [[music]], dissonance is the quality of sounds that seems unstable and has an aural need to [[Resolution (music)|resolve]] to a stable consonance. Both consonance and dissonance are words applied to [[harmony]], [[Chord (music)|chord]]s, and [[Interval (music)|interval]]s and, by extension, to [[melody]], [[tonality]], and even [[rhythm]] and [[metre (music)|metre]]. Although there are physical and neurological facts important to understanding the idea of dissonance, the precise definition of dissonance is culturally conditioned—definitions of and conventions of usage related to dissonance vary greatly among different musical styles, traditions, and cultures. Nevertheless, the basic ideas of dissonance, consonance, and resolution exist in some form in all musical traditions that have a concept of melody, harmony, or tonality.{{citation needed|date=July 2014|reason=Specific claim about universality of a musical aspect or concept.}} Dissonance being the complement of consonance it may be defined, as above, as non-coincidence of partials, lack of fusion or pattern matching, or as complexity.

Additional confusion about the idea of dissonance is created by the fact that musicians and writers sometimes use the word ''dissonance'' and related terms in a precise and carefully defined way, more often in an informal way, and very often in a metaphorical sense ("rhythmic dissonance"). For many musicians and composers, the essential ideas of dissonance and resolution are vitally important ones that deeply inform their musical thinking on a number of levels.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Despite the fact that words like unpleasant and grating are often used to explain the sound of dissonance, all music with a harmonic or tonal basis&amp;mdash;even music perceived as generally harmonious&amp;mdash;incorporates some degree of dissonance. The buildup and release of tension (dissonance and resolution), which can occur on every level from the subtle to the crass, is partially responsible for what listeners perceive as beauty, emotion, and expressiveness in music.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Musical style===
{{quote|''The concept of dissonance does not belong to the domain of harmony as it is presented to us by Nature'', but is derived from [[voice leading]], which is an essential constituent of ''Art''.|[[Oswald Jonas|Oswald]] {{harvtxt|Jonas|1982|p=19}} }}&lt;!--This is not a quotation from Schenker, it is Jonas' own interpretation, and his own emphasis.--&gt;

Understanding a particular musical style's treatment of dissonance—what is considered dissonant and what rules or procedures govern how dissonant intervals, chords, or notes are treated—is key in understanding that particular style. For instance, [[harmony]] is generally governed by chords, which are collections of notes defined as tolerably consonant by the style. (There is likely, however, to be a hierarchy of chords, with some considered more consonant and some more dissonant.) Any note that does not fall within the prevailing harmony is considered dissonant. A given style typically pays attention to how its musical structure approaches dissonance (in steps is less jarring, a leap is more jarring), and even more to how they resolve (almost always by step), to how they fit within the meter and rhythm (dissonances on strong beats are more emphatic, those on weaker beats less vital), and to how they lie within the phrase (dissonances tend to resolve at phrase's end).{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===In traditional music===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}
Sharp dissonant intervals and chords play a prominent role in many traditional musical cultures. Vocal polyphonic traditions from [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]], [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Albania]], [[Latvia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Nuristan]], some [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] minority singing traditions, Lithuanian [[sutartinės]], some polyphonic traditions from [[Flores]] and [[Melanesia]] are predominantly based on the use of sharp dissonant intervals and chords. The most prominent dissonance in most of these cultures is the interval of the [[neutral second]] (which is between the minor and major seconds). This interval is known to create the maximum sharpness and is known in German ethnomusicology under the term "Schwebungsdiaphonie".

Dips in this graph show consonant intervals such as 4:5 and 2:3. Other components not modeled by this theory include critical band roughness, and tonal context (e.g., an augmented second is more dissonant than a minor third although in equal temperament the interval, 300 cents, is the same for both).

Musical styles are similar to languages, in that certain physical, physiological, and neurological facts create bounds that greatly affect the development of all languages. Nevertheless, different cultures and traditions have incorporated the possibilities and limitations created by these physical and neurological facts into vastly different, living systems of human language. Neither the importance of the underlying facts nor the importance of the culture in assigning a particular meaning to the underlying facts should be understated.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

For instance, two notes played simultaneously but with slightly different frequencies produce a [[beat (acoustics)|beating]] "wah-wah-wah" sound. Musical styles such as traditional European classical music consider this effect objectionable ("out of tune") and go to great lengths to eliminate it. Other musical styles such as Indonesian [[gamelan]] consider this sound an attractive part of the musical timbre and go to equally great lengths to create instruments that produce this slight "[[Roughness (psychophysics)|roughness]]" ({{harvnb|Vassilakis|2005}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}).

Sensory dissonance and its two perceptual manifestations ([[beat (acoustics)|beating]] and roughness) are both closely related to a sound signal's amplitude fluctuations. Amplitude fluctuations describe variations in the maximum value (amplitude) of sound signals relative to a reference point and are the result of [[Interference (wave propagation)|wave interference]]. The interference principle states that the combined amplitude of two or more vibrations (waves) at any given time may be larger (constructive interference) or smaller (destructive interference) than the amplitude of the individual vibrations (waves), depending on their phase relationship. In the case of two or more waves with different frequencies, their periodically changing phase relationship results in periodic alterations between constructive and destructive interference, giving rise to the phenomenon of amplitude fluctuations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Amplitude fluctuations can be placed in three overlapping perceptual categories related to the rate of fluctuation. Slow amplitude fluctuations (≈≤20 per second) are perceived as loudness fluctuations referred to as beating. As the rate of fluctuation is increased, the loudness appears constant, and the fluctuations are perceived as "fluttering" or roughness. As the amplitude fluctuation rate is increased further, the roughness reaches a maximum strength and then gradually diminishes until it disappears (≈≥75–150 fluctuations per second, depending on the frequency of the interfering tones).

Assuming the ear performs a frequency analysis on incoming signals, as indicated by [[Ohm's acoustic law]] (see {{harvnb|Helmholtz|1885}}; {{harvnb|Levelt and Plomp|1964}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}), the above perceptual categories can be related directly to the bandwidth of the hypothetical analysis filters ({{harvnb|Zwicker, Flottorp, and Stevens|1957}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}; {{harvnb|Zwicker|1961}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}). For example, in the simplest case of amplitude fluctuations resulting from the addition of two sine signals with frequencies ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the fluctuation rate is equal to the frequency difference between the two sines |''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|, and the following statements represent the general consensus:

# If the fluctuation rate is smaller than the filter bandwidth, then a single tone is perceived either with fluctuating loudness (beating) or with roughness.
# If the fluctuation rate is larger than the filter bandwidth, then a complex tone is perceived, to which one or more pitches can be assigned but which, in general, exhibits no beating or roughness.

Along with amplitude fluctuation rate, the second most important signal parameter related to the perceptions of beating and roughness is the degree of a signal's amplitude fluctuation, that is, the level difference between peaks and valleys in a signal ({{harvnb|Terhardt|1974}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}; {{harvnb|Vassilakis|2001}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}). The degree of amplitude fluctuation depends on the relative amplitudes of the components in the signal's spectrum, with interfering tones of equal amplitudes resulting in the highest fluctuation degree and therefore in the highest beating or roughness degree.

For fluctuation rates comparable to the auditory filter bandwidth, the degree, rate, and shape of a complex signal's amplitude fluctuations are variables that are manipulated by musicians of various cultures to exploit the beating and roughness sensations, making amplitude fluctuation a significant expressive tool in the production of musical sound. Otherwise, when there is no pronounced beating or roughness, the degree, rate, and shape of a complex signal's amplitude fluctuations remain important, through their interaction with the signal's spectral components. This interaction is manifested perceptually in terms of pitch or timbre variations, linked to the introduction of combination tones ({{harvnb|Vassilakis|2001}}; {{harvnb|Vassilakis|2005}}; {{harvnb|Vassilakis|2007}}).

The beating and roughness sensations associated with certain complex signals are therefore usually understood in terms of sine-component interaction within the same frequency band of the hypothesized auditory filter, called [[critical band]].

{{Listen|filename=Dissonance-M2-to-unison.ogg|title=Two pitches moving from the interval of a Major 2nd to a unison|description=This file illustrates the roughness and beat oscillations that gradually reduce as the interval moves towards the unison.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

*Frequency ratios: ratios of higher simple numbers are more dissonant than lower ones ({{harvnb|Pythagoras}}{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;!--A proper citation is needed.--&gt;).

In human hearing, the varying effect of simple ratios may be perceived by one of these mechanisms:

*Fusion or pattern matching: fundamentals may be perceived through pattern matching of the separately analyzed partials to a best-fit exact-harmonic template ({{harvnb|Gerson and Goldstein|1978}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}) or the best-fit subharmonic ({{harvnb|Terhardt|1974}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}), or harmonics may be perceptually fused into one entity, with dissonances being those intervals less likely mistaken for unisons, the imperfect intervals, because of the multiple estimates, at perfect intervals, of fundamentals, for one harmonic tone ({{harvnb|Terhardt|1974}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}). By these definitions, inharmonic partials of otherwise harmonic spectra are usually processed separately (Hartmann et al., 1990), unless frequency or amplitude modulated coherently with the harmonic partials {{harv|McAdams|1983}}. For some of these definitions, neural firing supplies the data for pattern matching; see directly below (e.g., {{harvnb|Moore|1989|pp=183–87}}; {{harvnb|Srulovicz and Goldstein|1983}}).
*Period length or neural-firing coincidence: with the length of periodic neural firing created by two or more waveforms, higher simple numbers creating longer periods or lesser coincidence of neural firing and thus dissonance ({{harvnb|Patterson|1986|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2014}}}}; {{harvnb|Boomsliter and Creel|1961|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2014}}}}; {{harvnb|Meyer|1898|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2014}}}}; {{harvnb|Roederer|1973|pp=145–49}}). Purely harmonic tones cause neural firing exactly with the period or some multiple of the pure tone.
*Dissonance is more generally defined by the amount of beating between [[Harmonic series (music)|partial]]s (called [[harmonic]]s or [[overtone]]s when occurring in harmonic [[timbre]]s) ({{harvnb|Helmholtz|1954 [1877]}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}). {{harvnb|Terhardt|1984}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}} calls this "sensory dissonance". By this definition, dissonance is dependent not only on the width of the interval between two notes' fundamental frequencies, but also on the widths of the intervals between the two notes' non-fundamental partials. Sensory dissonance (i.e., presence of beating and/or roughness in a sound) is associated with the inner ear's inability to fully resolve spectral components with excitation patterns whose [[critical bands]] overlap. If two pure sine waves, without harmonics, are played together, people tend to perceive maximum dissonance when the frequencies are within the critical band for those frequencies, which is as wide as a minor third for low frequencies and as narrow as a minor second for high frequencies (relative to the range of human hearing) {{harv|Sethares|2005|p=43}}. If harmonic tones with larger intervals are played, the perceived dissonance is due, at least in part, to the presence of intervals between the harmonics of the two notes that fall within the critical band {{harv|Roederer|1995|p=106}}.

Generally, the sonance (i.e., a continuum with pure consonance at one end and pure dissonance at the other) of any given interval can be controlled by adjusting the timbre in which it is played, thereby aligning its partials with the current tuning's notes (or ''vice versa'') {{harv|Sethares|2005|p=1}}. The sonance of the interval between two notes can be maximized (producing consonance) by maximizing the alignment of the two notes' partials, whereas it can be minimized (producing dissonance) by mis-aligning each otherwise nearly aligned pair of partials by an amount equal to the width of the critical band at the average of the two partials' frequencies ({{harvnb|Sethares|2005|p=1}}; {{harvnb|Sethares|2009}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}).

Controlling the sonance of more-or-less non-harmonic timbres in real time is an aspect of [[dynamic tonality]]. For example, in Sethares' piece ''[http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~sethares/C2ShiningC.mp3 C To Shining C]'' ([[Dynamic tonality#Example: C2ShiningC|discussed here]]), the sonance of intervals is affected both by tuning progressions and timbre progressions.

The strongest [[homophonic]] (harmonic) [[cadence (music)|cadence]], the authentic cadence, dominant to tonic (D-T, V-I or V&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;-I), is in part created by the dissonant [[tritone]]{{harv|Benward &amp; Saker|2003|p=54}} created by the seventh, also dissonant, in the dominant seventh chord, which precedes the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]].
[[File:Dominant seventh tritone resolution.png|right|thumb|200px|Tritone resolution inwards and outwards. {{audio|Tritone resolution inward.ogg|Play inward.}} {{audio|Tritone resolution outwards.mid|Play outwards.}}]]

==Instruments producing non-harmonic overtone series==
Musical instruments like [[Bell (instrument)|bells]] and [[xylophone]]s, called [[Idiophone]]s, are played such that their relatively stiff, non-trivial{{clarify|date=February 2015}} mass is excited to vibration by means of a blow.  This contrasts with [[violin]]s, [[flute]]s, or [[drum (instrument)|drums]], where the vibrating medium is a light, supple [[string (music)|string]], [[Aerophone|column of air]], or [[Drumhead|membrane]].  The [[overtone]]s of the [[Harmonic series (music)|inharmonic series]] produced by such instruments may differ greatly from that of the rest of the [[orchestra]], and the consonance or dissonance of the harmonic intervals as well {{harv|Gouwens|2009|p=3}}.

According to John {{harvtxt|Gouwens|2009|p=3}}, the [[Carillon|carillon's]] harmony profile is summarized:
* Consonant:  minor third, tritone, minor sixth, perfect fourth, perfect fifth, and possibly minor seventh or even major second
* Dissonant:  major third, major sixth
* Variable upon individual instrument: major seventh
*[[Inversion (interval)|Interval inversion]] does not apply.

==In history of Western music==
{{Rquote|right|When we consider musical works we find that the triad is ever-present and that the interpolated dissonances have no other purpose than to effect the continuous variation of the triad.|[[Lorenz Mizler]] 1739 (quoted in {{harvnb|Forte|1979|p=136}}) }}

Dissonance has been understood and heard differently in different musical traditions, cultures, styles, and time periods. Relaxation and tension have been used as analogy since the time of Aristotle till the present {{harv|Kliewer|1975|p=290}}.

The terms dissonance and consonance are often considered equivalent to tension and relaxation. A cadence is (among other things) a place where tension is resolved; hence the long tradition of thinking of a musical phrase as consisting of a [[Cadence (music)|cadence]] and a passage of gradually accumulating tension leading up to it {{harv|Parncutt and Hair|2011|loc=132}}.

Various psychological principles constructed through the audience's general conception of tonal fluidity determine how a listener will distinguish an instance of dissonance within a musical composition. Based on one's developed conception of the general tonal fusion within the piece, an unexpected tone played sightly variant to the overall schema will generate a psychological need for resolve. When the consonant is followed thereafter, the listener will encounter a sense of resolution. Within Western music, these particular instances and psychological effects within a composition have come to possess an ornate connotation {{harv|Parncutt and Hair|2011|p=132}}.

The application of consonance and dissonance "is sometimes regarded as a property of isolated [[Sonority (music)|sonorities]] that is independent of what precedes or follows them. In most Western music, however, dissonances are held to ''resolve'' onto following consonances, and the principle of [[Resolution (music)|resolution]] is tacitly considered integral to consonance and dissonance" {{harv|Parncutt and Hait|2011|p=132}}.

One of the early composers known for use of dissonants was Monteverdi ({{harvnb|Kempers and Bakker|1949|p=14}}: "His use of dissonants was in contradiction to all known rules; his melodies showed unheard-of intervals; he even neglected the rules of counterpoint, secure in his conviction that the new subjective art form needed a new means of expression"). The use of unresolved dissonance was also practiced by [[Moscheles]] ({{harvnb|Anon.|1826|p=349}}: "It however appears, that Mr. Moscheles, according to the most esteemed writers and the rules of composition, is perfectly justified in writing it D flat. The D flat is here a diminished 7th, which, though a dissonant, is not necessarily resolved in all cases") and taught by [[Chopin]] ({{harvnb|Eigeldinger, Howat, and Shohet|1988|p=42}}: "Musical prosody and declamation; phrasing—Here are the chief practical directions as to expression which Chopin often repeated to his pupils: A long note is stronger, as is also a high note. A dissonant is likewise stronger, and equally so a syncopated note. The ending of a phrase, before a comma, or a stop, is always weak. If the melody ascends, one plays crescendo, if it descends, decrescendo. Moreover, notice must be taken  of natural accents.)"

=== Antiquity and the middle ages ===
In Ancient Greece, ''armonia'' denoted the production of a unified complex, particularly one expressible in numerical ratios. Applied to music, the concept concerned how sounds in a scale or a melody fit together (in this sense, it could also concern the tuning of a scale) {{harv|Philip|1966|pp=123–24}}. The term ''symphonos'' was used by Aristoxenus and others to describe the intervals of the fourth, the fifth, the octave and their doublings; other intervals were said ''diaphonos''. This terminology probably referred to the Pythagorean tuning, where fourths, fifths and octaves (ratios 4:3, 3:2 and 2:1) were directly tunable, while the other degrees (other 3-prime ratios) could only be tuned by combinations of the preceding ({{harvnb|Aristoxenus|1902|pp=188–206}} See {{harvnb|Tenney|1988|pp=11–12}}). Until the advent of polyphony and even later, this remained the basis of the concept of consonance/dissonance (''symphonia''/''diaphonia'') in Occidental theory.

In the early Middle Ages, the Latin term ''consonantia'' translated either ''armonia'' or ''symphonia''. Boethius (6th century) characterizes consonance by its sweetness, dissonance by its harshness: "Consonance (''consonantia'') is the blending (''mixtura'') of a high sound with a low one, sweetly and uniformly (''suauiter uniformiterque'') arriving to the ears. Dissonance is the harsh and unhappy percussion (''aspera atque iniocunda percussio'') of two sounds mixed together (''sibimet permixtorum'')" {{harv|Boethius|n.d.|loc=f. 13v.}}. It remains unclear, however, whether this could refer to simultaneous sounds. The case becomes clear, however, with Hucbald of Saint Amand (''c''900), who writes: "Consonance (''consonantia'') is the measured and concordant blending (''rata et concordabilis permixtio'') of two sounds, which will come about only when two simultaneous sounds from different sources combine into a single musical whole (''in unam simul modulationem conveniant'') […]. There are six of these consonances, three simple and three composite, […] octave, fifth, fourth, and octave-plus-fifth, octave-plus-fourth and double octave" ({{harvnb|Hucbald|n.d.|p=107}}; translated in {{harvnb|Babb|1978|p=19}}).

According to {{harvtxt|Johannes de Garlandia|13th century}}:
*Perfect consonance: unisons and octaves. (''Perfecta dicitur, quando due voces junguntur in eodem tempore, ita quod una, secundum auditum, non percipitur ab alia propter concordantiam, et dicitur equisonantiam, ut in unisono et diapason.'' — "[Consonance] is said perfect, when two voices are joined at the same time, so that the one, by audition, cannot be distinguished from the other because of the concordance, and it is called equisonance, as in unison and octave.")
*Median consonance: fourths and fifths. (''Medie autem dicuntur, quando duo voces junguntur in eodem tempore; que neque dicuntur perfecte, neque imperfecte, sed partim conveniunt cum perfectis, et partim cum imperfectis. Et sunt due species, scilicet diapente et diatessaron.'' — "Consonances are said median, when two voices are joined at the same time, which neither can be said perfect, nor imperfect, but which partly agree with the perfect, and partly with the imperfect. And they are of two species, namely the fifth and the fourth.")
*Imperfect consonance: minor and major thirds. (Imperfect consonances are not formally mentioned in the treatise, but the quotation above concerning median consonances does refer to imperfect consonances, and the section on consonances concludes: ''Sic apparet quod sex sunt species concordantie, scilicet: unisonus, diapason, diapente, diatessaron, semiditonus, ditonus.'' — "So it appears that there are six species of consonances, that is: unison, octave, fifth, fourth, minor third, major third." The last two appear as imperfect consonances by elimination.)
*Imperfect dissonance: major sixth (tone + fifth) and minor seventh (minor third + fifth). (''Imperfecte dicuntur, quando due voces junguntur ita, quod secundum auditum vel possunt aliquo modo compati, tamen non concordant. Et sunt due species, scilicet tonus cum diapente et semiditonus cum diapente.'' — [Dissonances] are said imperfect, when two voices are joined so that by audition although they can to some extent match, nevertheless they do not concord. And there are two species, namely tone plus fifth and minor third plus fifth.")
*Median dissonance: tone and minor sixth (semitone + fifth). (''Medie dicuntur, quando due voces junguntur ita, quod partim conveniunt cum perfectis, partim cum imperfectis. Et iste sunt due species, scilicet tonus et simitonium cum diapente.'' — [Dissonances] are said median when two voices are joined so that they partly match the perfect, partly the imperfect. And they are of two species, namely tone and semitone plus fifth.")
*Perfect dissonance: semitone, tritone, major seventh (major third + fifth). (Here again, the perfect dissonances can only be deduced by elimination from this phrase: ''Iste species dissonantie sunt septem, scilicet: semitonium, tritonus, ditonus cum diapente; tonus cum diapente, semiditonus cum diapente; tonus et semitonium cum diapente.'' — These species of dissonances are seven: semitone, tritone, major third plus fifth; tone plus fifth, minor third plus fifth; tone and semitone plus fifth.")

One example of imperfect consonances previously considered dissonances{{clarify|date=July 2014}}&lt;!--Are these being treated the same, or differently from the perfect consonances, or the same or differently from dissonances, and how?

It is worth noting that "perfect" and "imperfect" and the notion of being (''esse'') must be taken in their contemporaneous [[Latin]] meanings ([[:la:Perfectum|''perfectum'']], [[:la:Imperfectum|''imperfectum'']]) to understand these terms, such that imperfect is "unfinished" or "incomplete" and thus an imperfect dissonance is "not quite manifestly dissonant" and perfect consonance is "done almost to the point of excess".{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}  Also, [[Inversion (interval)|inversion of intervals]] ([[major second]] in some sense equivalent to [[minor seventh]]) and [[octave]] [[Pitch circularity|reduction]] ([[minor ninth]] in some sense equivalent to minor second) were [[Jean-Philippe Rameau|yet unknown]] during the Middle Ages.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Due to the different [[Just intonation|tuning systems]] compared to [[Equal temperament|modern times]], the minor seventh and [[major ninth]] were "harmonic consonances", meaning that they correctly reproduced the interval ratios of the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] which softened a bad effect {{harv|Schulter|1997b}}.{{Clarify|date=January 2015}}&lt;!--This cannot be true: harmonic partials were unknown in the Middle Ages--&gt; They were also often filled in by pairs of perfect fourths and perfect fifths respectively, forming [[resonance|resonant]] (blending) units characteristic of the musics of the time {{harv|Schulter|1997c}}, where "resonance" forms a [[Three-valued logic|complementary trine]] with the categories of consonance and dissonance.{{Clarify|date=January 2015}} Conversely, the thirds and [[Interval (music)|sixths]] were [[Musical temperament|tempered]] severely from [[Pythagorean tuning|pure ratios]]{{Clarify|date=January 2015}}&lt;!--Pythagorean tuning is NOT a temperament. The very idea of temperament, closely linked with instruments of fixed pitches, appears only in the 16th century (Piero Aron)--&gt;, and in practice usually treated as dissonances in the sense that they had to [[resolution (music)|resolve]] to form complete [[perfect cadence]]s and stable sonorities {{harv|Schulter|1997d}}.

The salient differences from modern conception:{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}{{Clarify|date=January 2015}}&lt;!--This all appears to describe Schulter's "neo-medieval" practice, not true medieval usages--&gt;  
*parallel fourths and fifths were acceptable and necessary, open fourths and fifths inside octaves were the characteristic stable sonority in 3 or more voices,
*minor sevenths and major ninths were fully structural,
*tritones—as a deponent{{Clarify|date=January 2015}}&lt;!--What, grammatically passive, or presenting a deposition in court?--&gt; sort of fourth or fifth—were sometimes stacked with perfect fourths and fifths,
*thirds and sixths (and tall [[Chord (music)|stacks thereof]]) were not the sort of intervals upon which stable harmonies were based,
*final cadential consonances of fourth, fifths, and octaves need not be the target of "resolution" on a beat-to-beat (or similar) time basis: minor sevenths and major ninths may move to octaves forthwith, or sixths to fifths (or minor sevenths), but the fourths and fifths within might become "dissonant" 5/3, 6/3, or 6/4 [[chordioid]]s{{Clarify|date=January 2015}}, continuing the succession of non-consonant sonorities for timespans limited only by the next cadence.

===Renaissance===
In [[Renaissance music]], the perfect fourth above the bass was considered a dissonance needing immediate resolution. The ''regola delle terze e seste'' ("rule of thirds and sixths") required that imperfect consonances should resolve to a perfect one by a half-step progression in one voice and a whole-step progression in another {{harv|Dahlhaus|1990|p=179}}. The viewpoint concerning successions of imperfect consonances—perhaps more concerned by a desire to avoid monotony than by their dissonant or consonant character—has been variable. Anonymous XIII (13th century) allowed two or three, Johannes de Garlandia's ''Optima introductio'' (13th-14th century) three, four or more, and Anonymous XI (15th century) four or five successive imperfect consonances. [[Adam von Fulda]] {{harv|Gerbert|1784|loc=3:353}} wrote "Although the ancients formerly would forbid all sequences of more than three or four imperfect consonances, we more modern do not prohibit them."

===Common practice period===
In the [[common practice period]], musical style required [[preparation (music)|preparation]] for all dissonances, followed by a [[resolution (music)|resolution]] to a consonance. There was also a distinction between [[melodic]] and [[harmonic]] dissonance. Dissonant melodic intervals included the [[tritone]] and all [[augmentation (music)|augmented]] and [[diminution|diminished]] intervals. Dissonant harmonic intervals included:

*Minor second and [[major seventh]]
*[[Augmented fourth]] and [[diminished fifth]] ([[enharmonically]] equivalent, [[tritone]])

Thus, Western musical history can be seen as progressing from a limited definition of consonance to an ever-wider definition of consonance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Early in history, only intervals low in the [[overtone|overtone series]] were considered consonant. As time progressed, intervals ever higher on the overtone series were considered as such. The final result of this was the so-called "[[emancipation of the dissonance]]" {{harv|Schoenberg|1975|pp=258–64}} by some 20th-century composers. Early-20th-century American composer [[Henry Cowell]] viewed [[tone cluster]]s as the use of higher and higher overtones {{harv|Cowell|1969|pp=111–39|quote="the natural spacing of so-called dissonances is as seconds, as in the overtone series, rather than sevenths and ninths....Groups spaced in seconds may be made to sound euphonious, particularly if played in conjunction with fundamental chord notes taken from lower in the same overtone series. Blends them together and explains them to the ear."}}.

Despite the fact that this idea of the historical progression towards the acceptance of ever greater levels of dissonance is somewhat oversimplified and glosses over important developments in the history of Western music, the general idea was attractive to many 20th-century modernist composers and is considered a formative [[meta-narrative]] of [[musical modernism]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Composers in the Baroque era were well aware of the expressive potential of dissonance:[[File:Bach Preludio XXI from Well-tempered Clavier, Vol 1.wav|thumb|Bach Preludio XXI from Well-tempered Clavier, Vol 1]]
[[File:Dissonance in Bach.PNG|thumb|center|300px|A sharply dissonant chord in Bach's ''Well-Tempered Clavier, Vol. I'' (Preludio XXI) ]]

Bach uses dissonance to communicate religious ideas in his sacred [[cantatas]] and Passion settings. At the end  of the ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'', where the agony of Christ’s betrayal and crucifixion is portrayed, [[John Eliot Gardiner|John Eliot]] {{harvtxt|Gardiner|2013|loc=427}} hears "a final reminder of this comes in the unexpected and almost excruciating dissonance Bach inserts over the very last chord: the melody instruments insist on B natural—the jarring leading tone—before eventually melting in a C minor cadence." [[File:Bach St Matthew Passion closing bars version for audio.wav|thumb|Bach St Matthew Passion closing bars]][[File:Bach St Matthew Passion closing bars.png|thumb|center|500px|Closing bars of the final chorus of Bach's St Matthew Passion.]] In the opening aria of Cantata [[BWV 54]], ''Widerstehe doch der Sünde'' ("upon sin oppose resistance"), nearly every strong beat carries a dissonance:[[File:Bach BWV 54, opening bars.png|thumb|center|600px|Bach BWV 54, opening bars. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9nNHSU3Icw Listen]]]

Albert Schweizer says that this aria “begins with an alarming chord of the seventh… It is meant to depict the horror of the curse upon sin that is threatened in the text" {{harv|Schweizer|1905|loc=53}}. Gillies {{harvtxt|Whittaker|1959|loc=368}} points out that “The thirty-two [[Basso continuo|continuo]] quavers of the initial four bars support four consonances only, all the rest are dissonances, twelve of them being chords containing five different notes. It is a remarkable picture of desperate and unflinching resistance to the Christian to the fell powers of evil.”

According to [[H.C. Robbins Landon]], the opening movement of [[Haydn]]’s [[Symphony No. 82]], "a brilliant C major work in the best tradition" contains "dissonances of barbaric strength that are succeeded by delicate passages of Mozartean grace." {{harv|Landon|1955|p=415}}:[[File:Haydn Symphony 82 1st movement bars 51-63.wav|thumb|Haydn Symphony 82 1st movement bars 51-63]][[File:Haydn Symphony 82 1st movement bars 51-64.png|thumb|center|500px|Haydn Symphony 82 1st movement bars 51-64]]

[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] music contains a number of quite radical experiments in dissonance.  The following comes from his Adagio and Fugue in C Minor, K. 546:[[File:Dissonance in Mozart's Adagio and Fugue in C minor, K546.wav|thumb|Dissonance in Mozart's Adagio and Fugue in C minor, K546]]
[[File:Dissonance in Mozart counterpoint.png|thumb|center|500px|Dissonance in Mozart's ''Adagio and Fugue in C Minor'', K. 546.]]

Mozart’s Quartet in C major, K465 opens with an adagio introduction that gave the work its nickname, the “Dissonance Quartet”:[[File:Mozart Dissonance Quartet opening bars.png|thumb|center|600px|Mozart Dissonance Quartet opening bars. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08uY0-ehL-w Listen]]]

There are several passing dissonances in this adagio passage, for example on the first beat of bar 3.  However the most striking effect here is implied, rather than sounded explicitly.  The A flat in the first bar is contradicted by the high A natural in the second bar, but these notes do not sound together as a discord. (See also [[False relation]].)

An even more famous example from Mozart comes in a magical passage from the slow movement of his popular [[Piano Concerto No. 21 (Mozart)|"Elvira Madigan"]] Piano Concerto 21, K467, where the subtle, but quite explicit dissonances on the first beats of each bar are enhanced by exquisite orchestration:[[File:Mozart Piano Concerto 21, 2nd movement bars 12-17.png|thumb|center|700px|Mozart Piano Concerto 21, 2nd movement bars 12–17. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45drOlTTTA8&amp;t=0m42s Link to passage]]]

Philip {{harvtxt|Radcliffe|1978|loc=52}} speaks of this as “a remarkably poignant passage with surprisingly sharp dissonances." Radcliffe says that the dissonances here "have a vivid foretaste of Schumann and the way they gently melt into the major key is equally prophetic of Schubert." [[Eric Blom|Eric]] {{harvtxt|Blom|1935|p=226}} says that this movement must have "made Mozart's hearers sit up by its daring modernities... There is a suppressed feeling of discomfort about it." 

The finale of [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9]] opens with a startling discord, consisting of a B flat inserted into a D minor chord:[[File:Grove Schrekensfanfare 1.png|thumb|center|300px|Beethoven Symphony No. 9, finale, opening bars. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4N5-OALObk Listen]]]

[[Roger Scruton|Roger]] {{harvtxt|Scruton|2009|loc=101}} alludes to [[Wagner]]’s description of this chord as introducing “a huge ''Schreckensfanfare''—horror fanfare.” When this passage returns later in the same movement (just before the voices enter) the sound is further complicated with the addition of a [[diminished seventh chord]], creating, in Scruton’s words “the most atrocious dissonance that Beethoven ever wrote, a [[first inversion]] D-minor triad containing all the notes of the D [[minor scale|minor harmonic scale]]”: [[File:Grove Schrekensfanfare 2.png|thumb|center|300px|Beethoven, Symphony No.9, finale, bars 208-10]]

[[Robert Schumann]]’s song ‘Auf Einer Burg’from his cycle ''Liederkreis''  Op. 39, climaxes on a striking dissonance in the fourteenth bar.  As [[Nicholas Cook|Nicholas]] {{harvtxt|Cook|1987|p=242}} points out, this is “the only chord in the whole song that Schumann marks with an accent.”  Cook goes on to stress that what makes this chord so effective is Schumann’s placing of it in its musical context: “in what leads up to it and what comes of it.”  Cook explains further how the interweaving of lines in both piano and voice parts in the bars leading up to this chord (bars 9-14) “are set on a kind of collision course; hence the feeling of tension rising steadily to a breaking point.” [[File:Schumann Auf einer Burg.png|thumb|center|600px|Schumann Auf einer Burg.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-DmyUI1PsQ Listen]]]

[[Richard Wagner]] made increasing use of dissonance for dramatic effect as his style developed, particularly in his later operas.  In the scene known as "Hagen’s Watch" from the first act of ''[[Götterdämmerung]]'', according to {{harvtxt|Scruton|2016|p=127}} the music conveys a sense of "matchless brooding evil", and the excruciating dissonance in bars 9–10 below it constitute "a semitonal wail of desolation". [[File:Wagner, Hagen's Watch from Act 1 of Gotterdamerung.png|thumb|center|500px|Wagner, Hagen's Watch from Act 1 of Götterdämmerung. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cixC4ovCWNI Listen]]]

Another example of a cumulative build-up of dissonance from the early 20th century (1910) can be found in the Adagio that opens [[Gustav Mahler]]’s unfinished [[Symphony No. 10 (Mahler)|10th Symphony]] :[[File:Mahler 10 opening Adagio, bars 201-213.png|thumb|center|500px|Mahler Symphony 10, opening Adagio, bars 201-213. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PQT5IK8mwA&amp;t=18m04s Link to passage ]]]

{{harvtxt|Taruskin|2005|loc=23}} parses this chord (in bars 206 and 208) as a “diminished nineteenth… a searingly dissonant dominant harmony containing nine different pitches.  Who knows what [[Guido Adler]], for whom the second and Third Symphonies already contained ‘unprecedented cacophonies’, might have called it?”

One example of modernist dissonance comes from a work that received its first performance in 1913, three years after the [[Mahler]]:
[[File:Stravinsky, The Rite of Spring, Sacrificial Dance.PNG|thumb|center|500px|Igor Stravinsky's ''The Rite of Spring'', "Sacrificial Dance" excerpt {{Audio|Stravinsky, The Rite of Spring, Sacrificial Dance.mid|Play}}]]

The West's progressive embrace of increasingly dissonant intervals occurred almost entirely within the context of [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic]] [[timbre]]s, as produced by vibrating strings and columns of air, on which the West's dominant musical instruments are based. By generalizing Helmholtz's notion of consonance (described above as the "coincidence of partials") to embrace non-harmonic timbres and their related tunings, consonance has recently been "emancipated" from harmonic timbres and their related tunings ({{harvnb|Milne, Sethares, and Plamondon 2007}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}; {{harvnb|Milne, Sethares, and Plamadon|2008}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}; {{harvnb|Sethares et al.|2009}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}). Using electronically controlled pseudo-harmonic timbres, rather than strictly harmonic acoustic timbres, provides tonality with new structural resources such as [[Dynamic tonality]]. These new resources provide musicians with an alternative to pursuing the musical uses of ever-higher partials of harmonic timbres and, in some people's minds, may resolve what [[Arnold Schoenberg]] described as the "crisis of tonality" ({{harvnb|Stein|1953}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}).

===Neo-classic harmonic consonance theory===
[[File:Thirteenth chord CMA13(sharp11).png|thumb|[[Thirteenth chord]] constructed from notes of the Lydian mode. {{audio|Thirteenth chord CMA13(sharp11).mid|Play}}]]

[[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]], in his 1953 ''[[Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization]]'', presents a slightly different view from classical practice, one widely taken up in [[Jazz]].  He regards the tritone over the tonic as a rather consonant interval due to its derivation from the Lydian dominant thirteenth chord {{harv|Russell|2008|p=1}}.

In effect, he returns to a [[Consonance and dissonance#The Middle Ages|Medieval]] consideration of "harmonic consonance": that intervals when not subject to [[octave equivalence]] (at least not by contraction) and correctly reproducing the [[Just intonation|mathematical ratios]] of the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] are truly non-dissonant.  Thus the harmonic minor seventh, natural major ninth, [[Quarter tone|half-sharp]] [[eleventh]] note ([[tempered scale|untempered]] [[tritone]]), [[Quarter tone|half-flat]] [[thirteenth]] note, and [[Quarter tone|half-flat]] [[fifteenth]] note must necessarily be consonant.  Octave equivalence (minor ninth in some sense equivalent to minor second, etc.) is no longer [[Jean-Philippe Rameau|unquestioned]].

Note that most of these pitches exist only in a universe of [[Microtonal music|microtones]] smaller than a [[semitone|halfstep]]; notice also that [[Dominant seventh chord|we already freely take]] the [[flat (music)|flat]] (minor) seventh note for the [[just intonation|just]] [[Harmonic seventh|seventh]] of the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] in [[chord (music)|chords]].  Russell extends by approximation the virtual merits of harmonic consonance to the [[Equal temperament|12TET]] tuning system of [[Jazz]] and the 12-note octave of the [[piano]], granting consonance to the [[Sharp (music)|sharp]] [[eleventh]] note (approximating the harmonic [[eleventh]]), that accidental being the sole pitch difference between the [[Major scale]] and the [[Lydian mode]].

(In another sense, that [[Acoustic scale|Lydian]] scale representing the provenance of the [[tonic chord]] (with major seventh and [[tritone|sharp fourth]]) replaces or supplements the [[Mixolydian mode|Mixolydian scale]] of the [[dominant chord]] (with minor seventh and [[Degree (music)|natural fourth]]) as the source from which to derive [[Extended chord|extended tertian harmony]].)

Dan Haerle, in his 1980 ''The Jazz Language'' {{harv|Studio 224|1980|p=4}}, extends the same idea of harmonic consonance and intact [[octave]] displacement to alter [[Paul Hindemith]]'s ''Series 2'' gradation table from ''The Craft of Musical Composition'' {{harv|Hindemith|1937–70|loc=1:{{Page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;!--the volume number is not sufficient to adequately locate a table in the book.--&gt;}}.  In contradistinction to Hindemith, whose scale of consonance and dissonance is currently the ''de facto'' standard, Haerle places the minor ninth as the most dissonant interval of all, more dissonant than the minor second to which it was once considered by all as octave-equivalent.  He also promotes the tritone from most-dissonant position to one just a little less consonant than the perfect fourth and perfect fifth.

For context: unstated in these theories is that musicians of the [[Romantic Era]] had effectively promoted the major ninth and minor seventh to a legitimacy of harmonic consonance as well, in their fabrics of 4-note chords {{harv|Tymoczko|2011|p=106}}.

[[File:FLETC Glynco-aerial.gif|thumb|Aerial photo of [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center|FLETC]], where US digital forensics standards were developed in the 1980s and '90s]]

'''Digital forensics''' (sometimes known as '''digital forensic science''') is a branch of [https://www.digitalforensic.in/2018/11/what-is-digital-forensic.html forensic science] encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to [[computer crime]].&lt;ref name="ijde-2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="carrier" /&gt; The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for [https://www.digitalforensic.in/2018/11/Change-MetaData-of-Image.html computer forensics] but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of [[Computer data storage|storing digital data]].&lt;ref name="ijde-2002" /&gt; With roots in the [[Home computer#The Home Computer .22Revolution.22|personal computing revolution]] of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.

Digital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before [[criminal court|criminal]] or [[civil litigation|civil]] courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as murder, theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as [[electronic discovery]] (ediscovery) may be involved.

Forensics may also feature in the private sector; such as during internal corporate investigations or intrusion investigation (a specialist probe into the nature and extent of an unauthorized [[Hacker (computer security)|network intrusion]]).

The technical aspect of an investigation is divided into several sub-branches, relating to the type of digital devices involved; computer forensics, [[network forensics]], [[forensic data analysis]] and [[mobile device forensics]]. The typical forensic process encompasses the seizure, forensic imaging (acquisition) and analysis of digital media and the production of a report into collected evidence.

As well as identifying direct evidence of a crime, digital forensics can be used to attribute evidence to specific suspects, confirm [[alibi]]s or statements, determine [[Mens rea|intent]], identify sources (for example, in copyright cases), or authenticate documents.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt; Investigations are much broader in scope than other areas of forensic analysis (where the usual aim is to provide answers to a series of simpler questions) often involving complex time-lines or hypotheses.&lt;ref name="df-basics"/&gt;

==How It Began==
Prior to the 1970s crimes involving computers were dealt with using existing laws. The first [[computer crime]]s were recognized in the 1978 Florida Computer Crimes Act, which included legislation against the unauthorized modification or deletion of data on a computer system.&lt;ref name="floract" /&gt;&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt; Over the next few years the range of computer crimes being committed increased, and laws were passed to deal with issues of [[copyright]], privacy/harassment (e.g., [[cyber bullying]], [[cyber stalking]], and [[online predator]]s) and [[child pornography]].&lt;ref name="exposed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="briefhistory" /&gt; It was not until the 1980s that federal laws began to incorporate computer offences. Canada was the first country to pass legislation in 1983.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt; This was followed by the US Federal ''[[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]]'' in 1986, Australian amendments to their crimes acts in 1989 and the British ''Computer Misuse Act'' in 1990.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="briefhistory" /&gt;

===1980s–1990s: Growth of the field===
The growth in computer crime during the 1980s and 1990s caused [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] to begin establishing specialized groups, usually at the national level, to handle the technical aspects of investigations. For example, in 1984 the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] launched a ''Computer Analysis and Response Team'' and the following year a computer crime department was set up within the British [[Metropolitan Police]] fraud squad. As well as being law enforcement professionals, many of the early members of these groups were also computer hobbyists and became responsible for the field's initial research and direction.&lt;ref name="mohay" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sommer" /&gt;

One of the first practical (or at least publicized) examples of digital forensics was [[Clifford Stoll|Cliff Stoll's]] pursuit of hacker [[Markus Hess]] in 1986. Stoll, whose investigation made use of computer and network forensic techniques, was not a specialized examiner.&lt;ref name="garfinkel" /&gt; Many of the earliest forensic examinations followed the same profile.&lt;ref name=dummies /&gt;

Throughout the 1990s there were high demand for these new, and basic, investigative resources. The strain on central units lead to the creation of regional, and even local, level groups to help handle the load. For example, the British [[National Hi-Tech Crime Unit]] was set up in 2001 to provide a national infrastructure for computer crime; with personnel located both centrally in London and with the various [[List of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom#Territorial police forces|regional police forces]] (the unit was folded into the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) in 2006).&lt;ref name="sommer" /&gt;

During this period the science of digital forensics grew from the ad-hoc tools and techniques developed by these hobbyist practitioners. This is in contrast to other forensics disciplines which developed from work by the scientific community.&lt;ref name="ijde-2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="palmer" /&gt; It was not until 1992 that the term "computer forensics" was used in [[Academic publishing|academic literature]] (although prior to this it had been in informal use); a paper by Collier and Spaul attempted to justify this new discipline to the forensic science world.&lt;ref name="wilding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt; This swift development resulted in a lack of standardization and training. In his 1995 book, "''High-Technology Crime: Investigating Cases Involving Computers''", K. Rosenblatt wrote:

{{quote|Seizing, preserving, and analyzing evidence stored on a computer is the greatest forensic challenge  facing law enforcement in the 1990s. Although most forensic tests, such as fingerprinting and DNA testing, are performed by specially trained experts the task of collecting and analyzing computer evidence is often assigned to patrol officers and detectives.&lt;ref name="rosenblatt" /&gt;}}

===2000s: Developing standards===
Since 2000, in response to the need for standardization, various bodies and agencies have published guidelines for digital forensics. The [[Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence]] (SWGDE) produced a 2002 paper, "''Best practices for Computer Forensics''", this was followed, in 2005, by the publication of an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard [https://www.anab.org/training/forensic (ISO 17025, ''General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories'']).&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SWGDE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iso17025" /&gt; A European lead international treaty, the [[Convention on Cybercrime]], came into force in 2004 with the aim of reconciling national computer crime laws, investigative techniques and international co-operation. The treaty has been signed by 43 nations (including the US, Canada, Japan, South Africa, UK and other European nations) and ratified by 16.

The issue of training also received attention. Commercial companies (often forensic software developers) began to offer certification programs and digital forensic analysis was included as a topic at the UK specialist investigator training facility, [[Centrex (police training agency)|Centrex]].&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sommer" /&gt;

Since the late 1990s mobile devices have become more widely available, advancing beyond simple communication devices, and have been found to be rich forms of information, even for crime not traditionally associated with digital forensics.&lt;ref name="punja" /&gt; Despite this, digital analysis of phones has lagged behind traditional computer media, largely due to problems over the proprietary nature of devices.&lt;ref name="ahmed" /&gt;

Focus has also shifted onto internet crime, particularly the risk of [[cyber warfare]] and [[cyberterrorism]]. A February 2010 report by the [[United States Joint Forces Command]] concluded:
{{quote|Through cyberspace, enemies will target industry, academia, government, as well as the military in the air, land, maritime, and space domains. In much the same way that airpower transformed the battlefield of World War II, cyberspace has fractured the physical barriers that shield a nation from attacks on its commerce and communication.&lt;ref name=JOE /&gt;}}

The field of digital forensics still faces unresolved issues. A 2009 paper, "Digital Forensic Research: The Good, the Bad and the Unaddressed", by Peterson and Shenoi identified a bias towards Windows operating systems in digital forensics research.&lt;ref name="goodbadugly" /&gt; In 2010 [[Simson Garfinkel]] identified issues facing digital investigations in the future, including the increasing size of digital media, the wide availability of encryption to consumers, a growing variety of operating systems and file formats, an increasing number of individuals owning multiple devices, and legal limitations on investigators. The paper also identified continued training issues, as well as the prohibitively high cost of entering the field.&lt;ref name="garfinkel" /&gt;

===Development of forensic tools===
{{Main|List of digital forensics tools}}
During the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed [[Computer forensics#Live analysis|live analysis]] on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing [[System administrator|sysadmin]] tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.

The need for such software was first recognized in 1989 at the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]], resulting in the creation of IMDUMP (by Michael White) and in 1990, SafeBack (developed by Sydex). Similar software was developed in other countries; DIBS (a hardware and software solution) was released commercially in the UK in 1991, and Rob McKemmish released ''Fixed Disk Image'' free to Australian law enforcement.&lt;ref name="mohay" /&gt;  These tools allowed examiners to create an exact copy of a piece of digital media to work on, leaving the original disk intact for verification. By the end of the 1990s, as demand for digital evidence grew more advanced commercial tools such as [[EnCase]] and [[Forensic Toolkit|FTK]] were developed, allowing analysts to examine copies of media without using any live forensics.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;  More recently, a trend towards "live memory forensics" has grown resulting in the availability of tools such as [[WindowsSCOPE]].

More recently, the same progression of tool development has occurred for [[mobile device]]s; initially investigators accessed data directly on the device, but soon specialist tools such as XRY or Radio Tactics Aceso appeared.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;

==Forensic process==
[[File:Portable forensic tableau.JPG|thumb|right|220px|A portable Tableau write-blocker attached to a [[hard drive]]]]
{{Main|Digital forensic process}}

A digital forensic investigation commonly consists of 3 stages: acquisition or [[Disk imaging#Hard drive imaging|imaging]] of exhibits,&lt;ref name="adams" /&gt; analysis, and reporting.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="first" /&gt; Ideally acquisition involves capturing an image of the computer's volatile memory (RAM)&lt;ref name="liveram"/&gt; and creating an exact [[Disk sector|sector]] level duplicate (or "forensic duplicate") of the media, often using a [[Forensic disk controller|write blocking]] device to prevent modification of the original. However, the growth in size of storage media and developments such as cloud computing &lt;ref name="adamscloud" /&gt; have led to more use of 'live' acquisitions whereby a 'logical' copy of the data is acquired rather than a complete image of the physical storage device.&lt;ref name="adams"/&gt; Both acquired image (or logical copy) and original media/data are [[Glossary of digital forensics terms#hashed|hashed]] (using an algorithm such as [[SHA-1]] or [[MD5]]) and the values compared to verify the copy is accurate.&lt;ref name="horenbeeck"/&gt;

Baker, Erik Andersen, Perlustro LP|title=Method and system for searching for, and collecting, electronically-stored information|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US8392706}}&lt;/ref&gt; approach (that has been dubbed 'hybrid forensics'&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richard|first=Adams,|last2=Graham|first2=Mann,|last3=Valerie|first3=Hobbs,|date=2017|title=ISEEK, a tool for high speed, concurrent, distributed forensic data acquisition|url=http://ro.ecu.edu.au/adf/171/|journal=Research Online|language=en|doi=10.4225/75/5a838d3b1d27f}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 'distributed forensics'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoelz|first=Bruno W.

This approach has been embodied in a commercial tool called ISEEK that was presented together with test results at a conference in 2017.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the analysis phase an investigator recovers evidence material using a number of different methodologies and tools. In 2002, an article in the ''International Journal of Digital Evidence'' referred to this step as "an in-depth systematic search of evidence related to the suspected crime."&lt;ref name="ijde-2002" /&gt; In 2006, forensics researcher [[Brian Carrier]] described an "intuitive procedure" in which obvious evidence is first identified and then "exhaustive searches are conducted to start filling in the holes."&lt;ref name="df-basics"/&gt;

The actual process of analysis can vary between investigations, but common methodologies include conducting keyword searches across the digital media (within files as well as unallocated and [[Fragmentation (computer)#Internal fragmentation|slack space]]), recovering deleted files and extraction of registry information (for example to list user accounts, or attached USB devices).

The evidence recovered is analysed to reconstruct events or actions and to reach conclusions, work that can often be performed by less specialised staff.&lt;ref name="ijde-2002" /&gt; When an investigation is complete the data is presented, usually in the form of a written report, in [[layman|lay persons]]' terms.&lt;ref name="ijde-2002" /&gt;

Digital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts.  As with other areas of forensics this is often as part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.

In civil litigation or corporate matters digital forensics forms part of the [[electronic discovery]] (or eDiscovery) process. Forensic procedures are similar to those used in criminal investigations, often with different legal requirements and limitations. Outside of the courts digital forensics can form a part of internal corporate investigations.

A common example might be following unauthorized [[Hacker (computer security)|network intrusion]]. A specialist forensic examination into the nature and extent of the attack is performed as a damage limitation exercise. Both to establish the extent of any intrusion and in an attempt to identify the attacker.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="df-basics" /&gt; Such attacks were commonly conducted over phone lines during the 1980s, but in the modern era are usually propagated over the Internet.&lt;ref name=kruse /&gt;

The main focus of digital forensics investigations is to recover objective evidence of a criminal activity (termed [[actus reus]] in legal parlance). However, the diverse range of data held in digital devices can help with other areas of inquiry.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;

;Attribution
:Meta data and other logs can be used to attribute actions to an individual. For example, personal documents on a computer drive might identify its owner.
;Alibis and statements
:Information provided by those involved can be cross checked with digital evidence. For example, during the investigation into the [[Soham murders]] the offender's alibi was disproved when mobile phone records of the person he claimed to be with showed she was out of town at the time.
;Intent
:As well as finding objective evidence of a crime being committed, investigations can also be used to prove the intent (known by the legal term [[mens rea]]). For example, the Internet history of convicted killer [[Neil Entwistle]] included references to a site discussing ''How to kill people''.
;Evaluation of source
:File artifacts and meta-data can be used to identify the origin of a particular piece of data; for example, older versions of [[Microsoft Word]] embedded a Global Unique Identifier into files which identified the computer it had been created on. Proving whether a file was produced on the digital device being examined or obtained from elsewhere (e.g., the Internet) can be very important.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;
;Document authentication
:Related to "Evaluation of source," meta data associated with digital documents can be easily modified (for example, by changing the computer clock you can affect the creation date of a file). Document authentication relates to detecting and identifying falsification of such details.

===Limitations===
One major limitation to a forensic investigation is the use of encryption; this disrupts initial examination where pertinent evidence might be located using keywords. Laws to compel individuals to [[key disclosure law|disclose encryption keys]] are still relatively new and controversial.&lt;ref name="garfinkel" /&gt;

==Legal considerations==
The examination of digital media is covered by national and international legislation. For civil investigations, in particular, laws may restrict the abilities of analysts to undertake examinations. Restrictions against [[network monitoring]], or reading of personal communications often exist.&lt;ref name="mocas" /&gt; During criminal investigation, national laws restrict how much information can be seized.&lt;ref name="mocas" /&gt; For example, in the United Kingdom seizure of evidence by law enforcement is governed by the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984|PACE act]].&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt; During its existence early in the field, the "International Organization on Computer Evidence" (IOCE) was one agency that worked to establish compatible international standards for the seizure of evidence.&lt;ref name="kanellis" /&gt;

In the UK the same laws covering computer crime can also affect forensic investigators. The 1990 [[Computer Misuse Act 1990|computer misuse act]] legislates against unauthorised access to computer material; this is a particular concern for civil investigators who have more limitations than law enforcement.

An individuals right to privacy is one area of digital forensics which is still largely undecided by courts. The US [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]] places limitations on the ability of law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence. The act makes a distinction between stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as [[VOIP]]). The latter, being considered more of a privacy invasion, is harder to obtain a warrant for.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rosenblatt" /&gt; The ECPA also affects the ability of companies to investigate the computers and communications of their employees, an aspect that is still under debate as to the extent to which a company can perform such monitoring.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;

[[Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] asserts similar privacy limitations to the ECPA and limits the processing and sharing of personal data both within the EU and with external countries. The ability of UK law enforcement to conduct digital forensics investigations is legislated by the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000|Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act]].&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;

===Digital evidence===
[[File:PersonalStorageDevices.agr.jpg|thumb|right|Digital evidence can come in a number of forms]]
{{Main|Digital evidence}}

When used in a [[court of law]] digital evidence falls under the same legal guidelines as other forms of evidence; courts do not usually require more stringent guidelines.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="legal"/&gt; In the United States the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] are used to evaluate the [[Admissible evidence|admissibility]] of digital evidence, the United Kingdom PACE and Civil Evidence acts have similar guidelines and many other countries have their own laws. US federal laws restrict seizures to items with only obvious evidential value. This is acknowledged as not always being possible to establish with digital media prior to an examination.&lt;ref name="mocas" /&gt;

Laws dealing with digital evidence are concerned with two issues: integrity and authenticity. Integrity is ensuring that the act of seizing and acquiring digital media does not modify the evidence (either the original or the copy). Authenticity refers to the ability to confirm the integrity of information; for example that the imaged media matches the original evidence.&lt;ref name="mocas" /&gt; The ease with which digital media can be modified means that documenting the [[chain of custody]] from the crime scene, through analysis and, ultimately, to the court, (a form of [[audit]] trail) is important to establish the authenticity of evidence.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;

Attorneys have argued that because digital evidence can theoretically be altered it undermines the reliability of the evidence. US judges are beginning to reject this theory, in the case ''US v. Bonallo'' the court ruled that "the fact that it is possible to alter data contained in a computer is plainly insufficient to establish untrustworthiness."&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bonallo" /&gt; In the United Kingdom guidelines such as those issued by [[Association of Chief Police Officers|ACPO]] are followed to help document the authenticity and integrity of evidence.

Digital investigators, particularly in criminal investigations, have to ensure that conclusions are based upon factual evidence and their own expert knowledge.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt; In the US, for example, Federal Rules of Evidence state that a qualified expert may testify “in the form of an opinion or otherwise” so long as:

{{quote|(1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.&lt;ref name="rule702" /&gt;}}

The sub-branches of digital forensics may each have their own specific guidelines for the conduct of investigations and the handling of evidence. For example, mobile phones may be required to be placed in a [[Faraday cage|Faraday shield]] during seizure or acquisition to prevent further radio traffic to the device. In the UK forensic examination of computers in criminal matters is subject to [[Association of Chief Police Officers|ACPO]] guidelines.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt; There are also international approaches to providing guidance on how to handle electronic evidence. The "Electronic Evidence Guide" by the [[Council of Europe]] offers a framework for law enforcement and judicial authorities in countries who seek to set up or enhance their own guidelines for the identification and handling of electronic evidence.&lt;ref name="EEG" /&gt;

===Investigative tools===

The admissibility of digital evidence relies on the tools used to extract it. In the US, forensic tools are subjected to the [[Daubert standard]], where the judge is responsible for ensuring that the processes and software used were acceptable. In a 2003 paper Brian Carrier argued that the Daubert guidelines required the code of forensic tools to be published and peer reviewed. He concluded that "open source tools may more clearly and comprehensively meet the guideline requirements than would closed
source tools."&lt;ref name="tools-legal" /&gt; In 2011 [[Josh Brunty]] stated that the scientific validation of the technology and software associated with performing a digital forensic examination is critical to any laboratory process.  He argued that "the science of digital forensics is founded on the principles of repeatable processes and quality evidence therefore knowing how to design and properly maintain a good validation process is a key requirement for any digital forensic examiner to defend their methods in court." "&lt;ref name="tools-validation" /&gt;

==Branches==
Digital forensics investigation is not restricted to retrieve data merely from the computer, as laws are breached by the criminals and small digital devices (e.g. tablets, smartphones, flash drives) are now extensively used. Some of these devices have volatile memory while some have non-volatile memory. Sufficient methodologies are available to retrieve data from volatile memory, however, there is lack of detailed methodology or a framework for data retrieval from non-volatile memory sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jansen |first1=Wayne |title=Ayers |website=NIST Special Publication |publisher=NIST |url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-72/sp800-72.pdf |accessdate=26 February 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212052654/http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-72/sp800-72.pdf |archivedate=12 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the type of devices, media or artifacts, digital forensics investigation is branched into various types.

===Computer forensics===
{{Main|Computer forensics}}

The goal of computer forensics is to explain the current state of a digital artifact; such as a computer system, storage medium or electronic document.&lt;ref name="cf-education"&gt;{{cite web |title= Computer forensics education |url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/8013/27399/01219052.pdf?arnumber=1219052 |publisher=IEEE Security &amp; Privacy |accessdate=26 July 2010 |author=A Yasinsac |author2= RF Erbacher |author3= DG Marks |author4= MM Pollitt |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline usually covers computers, [[embedded system]]s (digital devices with rudimentary computing power and onboard memory) and static memory (such as USB pen drives).

Computer forensics can deal with a broad range of information; from logs (such as internet history) through to the actual files on the drive. In 2007 prosecutors used a [[spreadsheet]] recovered from the computer of [[Joseph E. Duncan III]] to show [[Premeditated murder|premeditation]] and secure the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt; [[Sharon Lopatka]]'s killer was identified in 2006 after email messages from him detailing torture and death fantasies were found on her computer.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;

===Mobile device forensics===
{{Main|Mobile device forensics}}

Mobile device forensics is a sub-branch of digital forensics relating to recovery of digital evidence or data from a [[mobile device]]. It differs from Computer forensics in that a mobile device will have an inbuilt communication system (e.g. [[GSM]]) and, usually, proprietary storage mechanisms. Investigations usually focus on simple data such as call data and communications (SMS/Email) rather than in-depth recovery of deleted data.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="maarten-mob" /&gt; [[SMS]] data from a mobile device investigation helped to exonerate Patrick Lumumba in the [[murder of Meredith Kercher]].&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;

Mobile devices are also useful for providing location information; either from inbuilt gps/location tracking or via [[cell site]] logs, which track the devices within their range. Such information was used to track down the kidnappers of Thomas Onofri in 2006.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;

===Network forensics===
{{Main|Network forensics}}

Network forensics is concerned with the monitoring and analysis of [[computer network]] traffic, both [[Local area network|local]] and [[Wide area network|WAN]]/[[internet]], for the purposes of information gathering, evidence collection, or intrusion detection.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Palmer, A Road Map for Digital Forensic Research, Report from DFRWS 2001, First Digital Forensic Research Workshop, Utica, New York, 7–8 August 2001,  Page(s) 27–30&lt;/ref&gt; Traffic is usually intercepted at the [[Packet (information technology)|packet]] level, and either stored for later analysis or filtered in real-time. Unlike other areas of digital forensics network data is often volatile and rarely logged, making the discipline often reactionary.

In 2000 the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] lured computer hackers Aleksey Ivanov and Gorshkov to the United States for a fake job interview. By monitoring network traffic from the pair's computers, the FBI identified passwords allowing them to collect evidence directly from Russian-based computers.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moscowtimes" /&gt;

===Forensic data analysis===
{{Main|Forensic data analysis}}

Forensic Data Analysis is a branch of digital forensics. It examines structured data with the aim to discover and analyse patterns of fraudulent activities resulting from financial crime.

===Database forensics===
{{Main|Database forensics}}

Database forensics is a branch of digital forensics relating to the forensic study of [[databases]] and their metadata.&lt;ref name="db" /&gt; Investigations use database contents, log files and in-[[Random access memory|RAM]] data to build a timeline or recover relevant information.

'''Direct trade''' is a form of [[procurement|sourcing]] practiced by certain [[coffee roaster]]s and [[chocolate maker]]s who build direct relationships with the farmers and processors who sell them coffee or cocoa beans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/12/dining/12coff.html|title=To Burundi and Beyond for Coffee’s Holy Grail|last=Meehan|first=Peter|date=2007-09-12|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no single set of direct trade standards, and specific trade practices vary as a reflection of business and ethical priorities of the roaster or maker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lexiconoffood.com/labeling-and-certification/direct-trade|title=Direct Trade|work=Lexicon of Food|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, however, direct trade practitioners view their model as one of mutually-beneficial and transparent trade relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethicalcoffee.net/direct.html|title=What is Direct Trade coffee?|website=www.ethicalcoffee.net|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some advocates explicitly define direct trade as an alternative to [[fairtrade certification]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lexiconoffood.com/image/direct-vs-fair-trade-coffee|title=Contrasting Direct Trade and Fair Trade Coffee|date=2014-10-02|work=Lexicon of Food|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they seek to address perceived limitations of [[fair trade]] by:

'''Fair Trade''' practices -- such as those certified by Fairtrade International -- are designed to promote ethical trading standards to the benefit of the poorest of coffee producers in developing countries, providing opportunities for assistance with infrastructural growth, access to credit and financing to the farmers, and ensure ethical labor regulations for certified farms. Many studies have found that Fair Trade has brought stabilization to the world coffee market, as well as improved many coffee producing farms world wide&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ingenbleek, P., &amp; Reinders, T.|first=|date=2013|title=The development of a market for sustainable coffee in The Netherlands: Rethinking the contribution of Fair Trade|url=|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|volume=113 (3).|pages=461-474|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the efficacy of Fair Trade practices have become under a wide range of criticism ranging from less than advertised, to beneficial to large plantations but detrimental to the smallest of farms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruben, R., &amp; Fort.|first=|date=2011|title=The impact of Fair Trade certification for coffee farmers in Peru.|url=|journal=World Development.|volume=40 (3)|pages=570-582|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, unethical disbursement of profits&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Griffiths, P.|first=|date=July 2011|title=Ethical objections to Fairtrade.|url=|journal=Journal of Business Ethics.|volume=105 (3)|pages=357|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and even claims of a corrupt tool for marketing and profit causing death and destruction to coffee producers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole, N., &amp; Brown, K.|first=|date=2014|title=The problem with Fair Trade coffee.|url=|journal=Contexts, ,13 (1)|volume=13 (1)|pages=13 (1)|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A study from 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruben, R., &amp; Zuniga, G.|first=|date=2011|title=How standards compete : Comparative impact of coffee certification schemes in Northern Nicaragua.|url=|journal=Supply Chain Management: An International Journal|volume=16(2)|pages=98-109.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that Fair Trade strategies have a greater impact on the overall infrastructure development of growing coffee farms, and direct trades models show to have a greater impact on increased wages, and an overall improved quality of life, reported by the farmers included in the study. 

While such practices are common among self-identified direct trade coffee roasters and chocolate makers, there is no single definition of direct trade nor set of common standards. A lack of third-party accountability is a frequent criticism leveled by direct trade critics, which include former proponents frustrated by what they perceive as a trend of large, marketing-savvy roasters "who bombard consumers with the term despite not offering any clear definition of its meaning, any evidence of an actual direct trade scheme or the slightest shred of transparency regarding sourcing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailycoffeenews.com/2017/05/10/direct-trade-is-dead-long-live-its-founding-principles/|title=Direct Trade is Dead, Long Live its Founding Principles|date=2017-05-10|website=Daily Coffee News by Roast Magazine|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ETH was founded on 7 February 1854 by the Swiss Confederation and began giving its first lectures on 16 October 1855 as a polytechnic institute (''eidgenössische polytechnische Schule'') at various sites throughout the city of Zurich.&lt;ref name=hist45-55&gt;{{cite web |title=1848–1855: The polytechnical realisation of a long-held dream |url=https://www.ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/portrait/history/epochs/1848-1855.html |publisher=ETH Zürich |accessdate=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially composed of six faculties: [[architecture]], [[civil engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[chemistry]], [[forestry]], and an integrated department for the fields of [[mathematics]], natural sciences, literature, and social and [[political science]]s.

It is locally still known as ''Polytechnikum'', or simply as ''Poly'', derived from the original name ''eidgenössische polytechnische Schule'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethistory.ethz.ch/ |title=ETHistory 1855-2005 |publisher=ETH Zurich |date=2005 |website=ETHistory  |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which translates to "'''federal polytechnic school'''".

ETH is a ''federal'' institute (i.e., under direct administration by the Swiss government), whereas the [[University of Zürich]] is a ''[[cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]]'' institution. The decision for a new federal university was heavily disputed at the time; the liberals pressed for a "federal university", while the conservative forces wanted all universities to remain under cantonal control, worried that the liberals would gain more political power than they already had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethistory.ethz.ch/besichtigungen/epochen/debatte1/index_EN |title=1848-1855: Polytechnical realization of an old dream |publisher=ETH Zurich |date=31 March 2005 |website=ETHistory |accessdate=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning, both universities were co-located in the buildings of the University of Zürich.

From 1905 to 1908, under the presidency of [[Jérôme Franel]], the course program of ETH was restructured to that of a real university and ETH was granted the right to award doctorates. In 1909 the first doctorates were awarded. In 1911, it was given its current name, ''Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule''. In 1924, another reorganization structured the university in 12 departments. However, it now has 16 departments.

ETH Zurich is ranked among the top universities in the world. Typically, popular [[College and university rankings|rankings]] place the institution as the best university in continental Europe and ETH Zurich is consistently ranked among the top 1-5 universities in Europe, and among the top 3-10 best universities of the world.

Historically, ETH Zurich has achieved its reputation particularly in the fields of [[chemistry]], [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]. There are [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|32 Nobel Laureates]] who are associated with ETH. The most recent Nobel Laureate is [[Richard F. Heck]] who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in chemistry in 2010. Albert Einstein is perhaps its most famous alumnus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=ALBERT EINSTEIN (1879 – 1955) |url=http://www.zuerich.com/en/Visitor/Information/facts/famous-zurich-residents/albert-einstein.html|journal=Zuerich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the [[QS World University Rankings]] placed ETH Zurich at 7th overall in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=QS World University Rankings |url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2019 |website=Top Universities |publisher=QS Quacquarelli Symonds |accessdate=16 June 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, ETH was ranked 5th in the world in Engineering, Science and Technology, just behind the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Stanford University]], [[Cambridge University]] and [[National University of Singapore]]. In 2015, ETH also ranked 6th in the world in Natural Sciences, and in 2016 ranked 1st in the world for Earth &amp; Marine Sciences for the second consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=QS World University Rankings by Subject 2016 - Earth &amp; Marine Sciences|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2016/earth-marine-sciences#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search=|website=Top Universities|publisher=QS Quacquarelli Symonds|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Times Higher Education World University Ranking]]s ranked ETH Zurich 9th overall in the world and 8th in the world in the field of Engineering &amp; Technology, just behind the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Stanford University]], [[California Institute of Technology]], [[Princeton University]], [[Cambridge University]], [[Imperial College London]] and [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings|title=ETH Zurich – Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich|work=Times Higher Education|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a comparison of Swiss universities by [http://rankingswissup.ch/ swissUP Ranking] and in rankings published by [http://www.che.de CHE] comparing the universities of German-speaking countries, ETH Zurich traditionally is ranked first in natural sciences, computer science and engineering sciences.

In the survey [http://www.excellenceranking.org CHE ExcellenceRanking] on the quality of Western European graduate school programmes in the fields biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics, ETH was assessed as one of the three institutions to have excellent graduate programmes in all considered fields, the other two being the [[Imperial College London]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]. ETH Zurich had a total budget of 1.885 billion CHF&lt;ref name=AR2017/&gt; in the year 2017.

==Admission and education==
{{ETH Institutes}}
[[File:ETH Dome.jpg|thumb|left|Students and locals in ETH front courtyard]]
For Swiss students, ETH is not selective in its undergraduate admission procedures. Like every public university in Switzerland, ETH is obliged to grant admission to every Swiss resident who took the ''[[Matura]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Admission to the first semester with a Swiss matriculation certificate ("Matura") | work=ETH Zurich | url = https://www.ethz.ch/en/studies/registration-application/bachelor/swiss-matriculation.html | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 4 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Applicants from foreign countries are required to take either the ''reduced entrance exam'' or the ''comprehensive entrance exam'' although some applicants from several European countries are exempted from this rule. An applicant can be admitted to ETH even without any verifiable educational records by passing the ''comprehensive entrance exam''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Admission to first semester without Swiss matriculation certificate |work= ETH Zurich | url = https://www.ethz.ch/en/studies/registration-application/bachelor/other-certificates.html | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 4 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As at all universities in Switzerland, the academic year is divided into two semesters. Examinations are often held during examination sessions which are immediately before the beginning of the next semester (only a few select courses offer an exam immediately after the semester ends). After the first year of study, bachelor students must pass a block examination of all courses taken in the first year, called the ''Basisprüfung''. If the weighted average score is not sufficient, a student is required to retake the entire ''Basisprüfung'' which usually means having to re-sit the whole first year. About 50% of the students fail the ''Basisprüfung'' on the first try and many of them choose to drop out of the course instead of repeating the ''Basisprüfung''.
The structure of examinations in higher academic years is similar to the ''Basisprüfung'' (Basis examination), but with a higher success rate.
The regular time to reach graduation is six semesters for the [[Bachelor of Science]] degree and three or four further semesters for the [[Master of Science]] degree. The final semester is dedicated to writing a thesis.

Education at ETH Zurich generally focuses more on theoretical aspects than application and most degree programs contain a high amount of [[mathematics|mathematical training]]. The main language of instruction in undergraduate (Bachelor) studies is German and for admission a proof of sufficient knowledge of the German language is required for Bachelor students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Language requirements | work=ETH Zurich | url = https://www.ethz.ch/en/studies/registration-application/bachelor/other-certificates/language-requirements.html | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 4 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Master's programmes and doctoral studies are in English.

==Campus==
{{refimprove|section|date=February 2018}}&lt;!--only the last sentence has a citation--&gt;
[[File:ETH-Hoenggerberg-2008.jpg|thumb|320px|ETH Hönggerberg with the new HIT building]]
ETH Zurich has two campuses. The main building was constructed 1858–1864 outside and right above the eastern border of the town, but nowadays it is located right in the heart of the city. As the town and university grew, the ETH spread into the surrounding vineyards and later quarters. As a result, the ''Zentrum'' campus consists of various buildings and institutions throughout Zürich and firmly integrates the ETH in the city. The main building stands directly across the street from the [[University Hospital of Zurich]] and the [[University of Zurich]].

Because this geographic situation substantially hindered the expansion of ETH, a new campus was built from 1964 to 1976 on the ''Hönggerberg'' on a northern hill in the outskirts of the city. The last major expansion project of this new campus was completed in 2003; since then, the ''Hönggerberg'' location houses the departments of [[architecture]], [[civil engineering]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[materials science]] and [[physics]].

===Main building===
[[File:ETH Zürich Hauptgebäude, Ansicht von der Polyterasse 2011-08-06 ShiftN.jpg|thumb|Main building as seen from ''Polyterrasse'']]
[[File:ETH Zürich im Abendlicht.jpg|thumb|ETH Zurich at night.]]
The main building of ETH was built from 1858 to 1864 under [[Gustav Zeuner]]; the architect, however, was [[Gottfried Semper]], who was a professor of architecture at ETH at the time and one of the most important architectural writers and theorists of the age. Semper worked in a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style]] that was unique to him; and the namesake and architect of the [[Semperoper]] in Dresden. It emphasized bold and clear massings with a detailing, such as the rusticated ground level and giant order above, that derived in part from the work of [[Andrea Palladio]] and [[Donato Bramante]]. During the construction of the University of Zürich, the south wing of the building was allocated to the University until its own new main building was constructed (1912–1914). At about the same time, Semper's ETH building was enlarged and received its impressive [[cupola]].

===Science City===
In the year of ETH Zurich's 150th anniversary, an extensive project called "Science City" for the Hönggerberg Campus was started with the goal to transform the campus into an attractive district based on the principle of sustainability.
[[File:ETH Hönggerberg Frontansicht.JPG|540px|center|thumb|ETH Hönggerberg from the south, looking at the five "fingers" of the HCI and behind the high HPP building.]]

In September 2014 a new project to connect Science City by train was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adf-innovation.com/publikationen/by_rail_2014_S26-27.pdf |title=Tunnelbahnhof für "Science City" |website=www.adf-innovation.com |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====ETH Laboratory of Ion Beam Physics====
The ETH Laboratory of Ion Beam Physics (LIB) is a physics laboratory located in Science City. It specializes in [[accelerator mass spectrometry]] (AMS) and the use of [[ion beam]] based techniques with applications in [[archeology]], [[earth sciences]], [[life sciences]], [[Materials science|material sciences]] and [[physics|fundamental physics]]. An example of such application is the tracing of isotopes and the detection of rare [[Radionuclide|radionuclides]] with [[radiocarbon dating]] and the use of techniques such as [[Rutherford backscattering spectrometry]] or [[elastic recoil detection]].&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;{{Cite web

==Student life==
ETH students were found to be the busiest students of all institutions of higher education in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.students.ch/page_news_article.php?typ=157&amp;id=2382 "Willkommen auf Students.ch"] {{De icon}}{{Failed verification|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The undergraduates' tight curriculum consists of as much as twice the number of lectures as comparable courses of other Swiss universities.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

ETH has well over 100 student associations. Most notable is the [[VSETH]] (''Verband der Studierenden an der ETH'') which comprises all department associations. The associations regularly organize events with varying size and popularity. Events of the neighboring University of Zürich are well-attended by ETH students and vice versa. The VSETH organizes events of greater public attention, such as the ''Polyball'', the ''Polyparty'' (does not exist any more) and the ''Erstsemestrigenfest'', the first two housed in the main building of ETH. Sometimes, the annual ''Erstsemestrigenfest'' takes place at extraordinary locations, for example the [[Zürich Airport]]. All freshmen enjoy special treatment at that event.

Some of the notable associations that are not affiliated with a specific department are the ETH Entrepreneur Club and ETH Model United Nations. Both organisations enjoy high international standings and are regularly awarded for excellence in their field.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} ETH Juniors is another student run organisation. It forms a bridge between the industry and ETH and offers many services for students and companies alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethjuniors.ch/en/about-us|title=ETH Juniors|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Academic Sports Association of Zürich''' (ASVZ) offers more than 120 sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://portal.asvz.ethz.ch/english/Seiten/default.aspx | title=Academic Sports Association Zurich | accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest annual sports event is the ''SOLA-Stafette'' (SOLA relay race) which consists of 14 sections over a total distance of 140 kilometers. More than 760 teams participated in the 2009 edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.asvz.ethz.ch/news/Seiten/SOLA09.aspx SOLA-Stafette 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The 40th edition of the SOLA, held on May 4, 2013, had 900 enrolled teams, of which 893 started and 876 were classified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.sola.asvz.ethz.ch/news/Seiten/ErfolgreicheJubilaeumsstafette.aspx SOLA - Erfolgreiche Jubiläumsstafette]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 ASVZ celebrated their 75th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://75jahreasvz.ch|title=ASVZ|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801034944/http://75jahreasvz.ch/|archivedate=1 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
The annual [[Polyball]]  is the most prestigious public event at ETH, with a long tradition since the 1880s. The end of November, the ''Polyball'' welcomes around 10,000 dancers, music-lovers and partygoers in the extensively decorated main building of ETH. The ''Polyball'' is the biggest decorated ball in Europe.

The amicable rivalry between ETH and the neighbouring University of Zürich has been cultivated since 1951 (Uni-Poly). There has been an annual [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] match between teams from the two institutions on the river [[Limmat]].

There are many regular symposia and conferences at ETH, most notably the annual ''Wolfgang Pauli Lectures'', in honor of former ETH Professor [[Wolfgang Pauli]]. Distinct lecturers, among them 24 [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Laureate]]s, have held lectures of the various fields of [[natural science]]s at this conference since 1962.

'''Fesenkov Astrophysical Institute''' (Астрофизический институт имени В. Г. Фесенкова, АФИФ), or '''FAPHI''', is a research institute in [[Almaty|Almaty, Kazakhstan]]. The institute was founded in 1941 as the Institute for Astronomy and Physics of the Kazakh branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences, when a group of Soviet astronomers was evacuated during [[World War II]] from the European parts of the USSR to Almaty. In 1948 [[Gavriil Adrianovich Tikhov|G.A. Tikhov]] had organized an independent sector of [[astrobotany]], and in 1950 astronomers established the Astrophysical Institute of the Kazakh SSR. In 1989 the Institute was renamed after [[Vasily Fesenkov]], one of its founders.

FAPHI conducts both [[observation#observation in science|observational]] and theoretical research. The prime objects of observations are the [[Sun]], [[outer planets]], [[comets]], [[Herbig Ae/Be stars]], and [[active galaxy|active galaxies]]. The topics of theoretical research include [[stellar dynamics]] and [[computational astrophysics]], [[active galactic nuclei]], [[cosmology]], physics of comets and [[interstellar medium]]. The institute runs three observational bases in mountains near Almaty: [[Kamenskoe Plateau Observatory]], [[Assy-Turgen Observatory]] and [[Tien Shan Astronomical Observatory]].

FAPHI is a member of the [[International Astronomical Union]].

'''Chile's food labelling and advertising law''', formally titled ''Ley 20.606, sobre la composición de los alimentos y su publicidad'' (“Law 20.606, on the nutritional composition of foods and their advertising”) establishes a regulatory framework on food security and healthy food with the intention of guiding consumers towards behaviour patterns that promote public health. After the 2012 law was enacted, its accompanying regulations came into full force on June 27, 2016. Andrew Jacobs, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', has characterized this measure as "the world’s most ambitious attempt to remake a country’s food culture" and suggests it "could be a model for how to turn the tide on a global [[obesity]] epidemic that researchers say contributes to four million premature deaths a year."&lt;ref name="nyt-feb2018"&gt;Andrew Jacobs, “[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/health/obesity-chile-sugar-regulations.html In Sweeping War on Obesity, Chile Slays Tony the Tiger]”, 7 Feb. 2018, ''[[The New York Times]]''. Accessed 3 Sept. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chile]], the law — often referred to by less cumbersome names such as ''ley de etiquetado de alimentos'' (“food labelling law”), ''ley del Súper Ocho'' (“Super Eight law”), or simply ''ley de alimentos'' (“food law”) — specifically regulates the delivery of nutritional information on foods high in [[Health effects of salt|sodium]], [[Saturated fat#Dietary recommendations|saturated fat]]s, [[Sugar#Recommended dietary intake|sugar]]s or [[Food energy#Recommended daily intake|calorie]]s. The standard also prohibits the sale of such foods in educational institutions, and limits the [[Advertising to children|advertising of these products to children]] under fourteen.

==History==
===Background===
According to a 2010 national health survey, more than 60 percent of Chile’s population suffers from excessive weight. The problem begins early in childhood, with more than 10 percent of children under six, more than 15 percent of preschoolers and more than 25 percent of first-grade children presenting with obesity. When the overweight and the obese children are considered as a group, more than 50 percent of them, according to the Chilean Ministry of Health, are found to suffer from malnutrition, which is considered the main public health problem in the country.&lt;ref name="eval-report-es"&gt;''[http://web.minsal.cl/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Informe-Implementaci%C3%B3n-Ley-20606-junio-2017-PDF.pdf Informe de evaluación de la implementación de la ley sobre composición nutricional de los alimentos y su publicidad]'' (“Evaluation report on the implementation of the law on the nutritional composition of foods and their advertising”), June 2017, Subsecretaría de Salud Pública, Departamento de Nutrición y Alimentos (Public Health subsecretariat, Department of Nutrition and Food, Ministry of Health, Government of Chile), 97 pp. Accessed 3 Sept. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation and regulations==
===Law 20.606===
The law has eleven articles; its stipulations establish: 

* The responsibility of manufacturers, importers or producers of food for human consumption to have specific labels on the nature of the product, with full and truthful information, and their responsibility to ensure that good practices guaranteeing food safety are followed in their production chain. 

* A duty of manufacturers, producers, distributors and importers of food to inform, on their containers or on their labels, as to the ingredients contained, including all additives and their [[nutritional information]], to follow food health regulations in which the characteristics and content of said food will determine the labelling, and especially to ensure that the information is sufficiently visible and comprehensible.

* A prohibition against [[adulterant|adulterating ingredients and prepared foods]] with anything that in some way may create an erroneous impression regarding their true nature, composition or quality, or that may cause damage to health, as determined by the Ministry of Health.

* A duty of preschool, elementary and secondary schools to include educational materials and exercise in order to promote healthy eating habits and physical activity, and the mandated requirement for the Education and Health ministries to have a nutritional monitoring system for students in preschool, elementary and secondary school.

* The requirement for the Ministry of Health to determine foods whose nutritional composition has high amounts of calories, fats, sugars or salt (or other ingredients, as determined by regulation), setting permitted maximums and ensuring compliance through the public health system.

* A prohibition against commercial sale or distribution in preschool, elementary and secondary schools of food products labelled as high in the regulated nutrients or calories, as well as the free delivery or advertising of such products to children under 14, including commercial tie-ins designed to appeal to children, such as toys, accessories, adhesives or similar products.

* A prohibition against labelling baby formulas and breast-milk substitutes in any way that may discourage [[breastfeeding]].

* An obligation that any food product marketed in Chile that contains among its ingredients — or that has used, in the course of its preparation — soy, milk, [[peanut]]s, eggs, seafood, fish, [[gluten]] or nuts must indicate this on its package or label.

===Regulatory regime===
Health ministry decree No. 13 (April 16, 2015), amended the government's processed foods regulation to adapt it to the provisions of Law 20.606 and specifying maximum calories, sodium, sugars and saturated fats in food; the values were set to diminish by progressive stages after the regulation's entry into force.&lt;ref name="gazette-977"&gt;''[http://www.minsal.cl/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/decreto_etiquetado_alimentos_2015.pdf Modifica Decreto Supremo N° 977 de 1996, Reglamento Sanitario de los Alimentos]'' (“Amendment to Supreme Decree No. 977 of 1996, Food Health Regulation.”), ''Diario Oficial de la República de Chile'' (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Chile”). Accessed 4 Sept. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The limits stipulated by law are:

|}

The regulation also detailed the foods that are exempted from the labelling obligation, which includes foods without added sugars, honey or syrups; without added sodium and without saturated fats; those sold in bulk or portioned out, divided and prepared at the request of the public (even if they are packaged at the time of sale); [[infant formula]]; commercially prepared minced [[baby food]], unless they contain added sugar; food prepared for medical use; food for [[weight management|weight control regimens]]; [[dietary supplement]]s and certain [[bodybuilding supplement|foods for athletes]]; and table-top [[sugar substitute]]s.&lt;ref name="gazette-977"/&gt;

==Compliance and impact==
===International impact===
Several countries have expressed interest in the Chilean standards and have considered their content in developing their own countries' labelling regulations, including [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Israel]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[El Salvador]] and [[Uruguay]].

In addition, international organizations — including the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), the [[Pan American Health Organization]],&lt;ref name="ops"&gt;''[https://www.paho.org/chi/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=845:opsoms-celebra-ley-de-alimentos-en-chile-como-ejemplo-para-el-resto-de-los-paises-de-las-americas&amp;Itemid=1005 OPS/OMS celebra Ley de Alimentos en Chile como ejemplo para el resto de los países de Las Américas]'' (“PAHO/WHO celebrates Chile's food law as an example for the rest of the countries of the Americas”), 22 Dec. 2016, Organización Panamericana de Salud. Accessed 3 Sept. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Nations|UN]]'s [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] and [[World Health Organization]], the [[Union of South American Nations]] and the [[OECD]] — have expressed support for the Chilean food labelling and advertising law and regulations and have facilitated bilateral cooperation, [[Memorandum of understanding|memoranda of understanding]] and the establishment of international networks. [[Codex Alimentarius]] has urged member countries to revise regulations on labelling, while the [[World Trade Organization]] has established international discussion panels on food labelling, at which Chile has been a prominent speaker.&lt;ref name="eval-report-es"/&gt;

In addition, during [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] negotiations, the governments of Mexico and Canada have advocated for nutritional warnings on foods, inspired by the Chilean experience, but the current [[United States]] government has supported efforts of the commercial food and beverage industry to prevent the adoption of laws similar to Chile's by demanding [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] clauses forbidding the enactment of such consumer safety laws in Canada, Mexico and the United States.” Lora Verheecke, a researcher at the [[Corporate Europe Observatory]], a non-profit group tracking corporate lobbying, has declared that once such pro-industry and anti-consumer rules are enshrined into international trade agreements, it becomes extremely difficult to overturn them in the laws of trade-pact member states: “It kind of kills a law before it can be written, and once you put it into one trade agreement, it can become the precedent for all future deals with future countries.”&lt;ref name="nyt-mar2018"&gt;Azam Ahmed, Matt Richtel and Andrew Jacobs, “[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/world/americas/nafta-food-labels-obesity.html In NAFTA Talks, U.S. Tries to Limit Junk Food Warning Labels]”, 7 Feb. 2018, ''[[The New York Times]]''.

'''The Franz Edelman Award for Achievement in Operations Research and the Management Sciences''' recognizes excellence in the execution of [[operations research]] on the organizational level.

==About==
The award is presented annually by the [[Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences]] (INFORMS).

The international competition pits six teams from industry, government, healthcare, and the non-profit sectors. The competition takes place at the INFORMS Business Analytics Conference and concludes with the announcement of the winner at a gala dinner at the conference. It began in 1971 as the TIMS Prize and was named for Franz Edelman, the operations research director of [[RCA]], shortly after his death in 1982. It carries a cash award of $10,000. Since its inception, nearly $250 billion in benefits have been tabulated among Franz Edelman Award finalist teams. Following the competition, INFORMS publishes papers by the Edelman finalists in the January issue of the INFORMS journal [[Interfaces (journal)|''Interfaces'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubsonline.informs.org/loi/inte Interfaces, All Volumes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Submergence of this unique landform assemblage and geoheritage feature beneath 15 m of water was one of many triggers to formulation of geoconservation philosophy.]]

'''Geodiversity''' is the variety of earth materials, forms and processes that constitute and shape the Earth, either the whole or a specific part of it.&lt;ref name=Zwolinski&gt;Zwolinski, Zb. 2004. ''Geodiversity'', in: ''Encyclopedia of Geomorphology'', A.Goudie (ed.), Routledge: pp. 417-418.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relevant materials include [[mineral]]s, [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], [[sediment]]s, [[fossil]]s, [[soil]]s and [[water]].&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brilha2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brilha |first1=José |date=2014 |title=Inventory and Quantitative Assessment of Geosites and Geodiversity Sites: a Review |url= |journal=Geoheritage |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1007/s12371-014-0139-3 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms may comprise [[fold (geology)|folds]], [[fault (geology)|faults]], [[landform]]s and other expressions of morphology or relations between units of earth material. Any natural process that continues to act upon, maintain or modify either material or form (for example [[tectonics]], [[sediment transport]], [[pedogenesis]]) represents another aspect of geodiversity. However geodiversity is not normally defined to include the likes of landscaping, concrete or other significant human influence.&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;Gray, M. 2004. ''Geodiversity: Valuing and Conserving Abiotic Nature''. John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd {{ISBN|978-0470848951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Geodiversity is neither homogeneously distributed nor studied across the planet. The identification of geodiversity hotspots (e.g. the islands of [[Geology of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Geology of Tasmania|Tasmania]]) may be indicative not simply of the distribution of geodiversity but also of the status of geoconservation initiatives. In this regard it is worth noting that the biodiversity of an ecosystem stems at least in part from its underlying geology.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; With the majority of biological species remaining undescribed the classification and quantification of geodiversity is not an abstract exercise in geotaxonomy but a necessary part of mature nature conservation efforts, which also requires a [[Geoethics|geoethical]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;Peppoloni S. and Di Capua G. (2012), "[http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/6099 Geoethics and geological culture: awareness, responsibility and challenges]". Annals of Geophysics, 55, 3, 335-341. doi: 10.4401/ag-6099.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to José Brilha geodiversity may be of scientific value or valued for other aspects. Geodiversity of scientific value can be either geosites or geoheritage elements that are ''[[ex situ]]''. Similarly geodiversity that is of little or no scientific value may be categorized as sites of geodiversity or geodiversity elements that are ''ex situ''.&lt;ref name=Brilha2014/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3076">{{Refimprove|date=October 2018}}The '''Gulf of St. Lawrence lowland forests''' are a [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forest]] [[ecoregion]] of eastern [[Canada]].

==Setting==
Located on the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], the world's largest estuary, this ecoregion covers all of [[Prince Edward Island]], the [[Magdalen Islands|Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine]] of Quebec, most of east-central [[New Brunswick]], the [[Annapolis Valley]], [[Minas Basin]] and the [[Northumberland Strait]] coast of [[Nova Scotia]]. This area has a coastal climate of warm summers and mild but snowy winters with an average annual temperature of around 5&amp;nbsp;°C going up to 15&amp;nbsp;°C in summer, the coast is hotter than the islands or the sheltered inland valleys.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=na0408|name=Gulf of St. Lawrence lowland forests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
The colder climate allows more hardwood trees to grow in the Gulf of St Lawrence than in most of this part of northeast North America. Trees of the region include eastern hemlock (''[[Tsuga canadensis]]''), balsam fir (''[[Abies balsamea]]''), American elm (''[[Ulmus americana]]''), black ash (''[[Fraxinus nigra]]''), [[eastern white pine]] (''Pinus strobus''), red maple, (''[[Acer rubrum]]'') northern red oak (''[[Quercus rubra]]''), black spruce (''[[Picea mariana]]''), red spruce (''[[Picea rubens]]'') and white spruce (''[[Picea glauca]]'').

==Fauna==
The forests are home to a variety of wildlife from reptiles including [[American black bear]] (''Ursus americanus''), [[moose]] (''Alces alces''), [[white-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus''), [[red fox]] (''Vulpes vulpes''), [[snowshoe hare]] (''Lepus americanus''), [[North American porcupine]] (''Erithyzon dorsatum''), [[fisher (animal)|fisher]] (''Martes pennanti''), [[North American beaver]] (''Castor canadensis''), [[bobcat]] (''Lynx rufus''), [[American marten]] (''Martes americana''), [[raccoon]] (''Procyon lotor'') and [[muskrat]] (''Ondatra zibethica''). The area is habitat for maritime ringlet butterflies (''[[Coenonympha nipisiquit]]'') and other invertebrates. Birds include many seabirds, a large colony of [[great blue heron]] (''Ardea herodias''), the largest remaining population of the endangered [[piping plover]] and one of the largest colonies of [[double-crested cormorant]] (''Phalacrocorax auritus'') in the world.

==Threats and preservation==
Most of this ecoregion has been altered by logging and clearance for agriculture with only 3% of original habitat remaining and that highly fragmented. The only large block of intact habitat remains in the area around [[Kouchibouguac National Park]] in New Brunswick, although even here logging is ongoing.

A '''hardstand''' is a paved area for parking heavy vehicles.

== Uses ==
Hardstand are found at [[airport]]s, [[military building|military facilities]], [[freight terminal]]s, and other facilities where heavy vehicles need to be parked for significant periods of time.

== Purpose ==
Heavy vehicles can sometimes be parked on areas of unpaved compacted earth for short periods of time.  But if left parked in these areas for extended periods of time, heavy vehicles can sink into the soil and become mired.

== Construction ==
[[File:Enola Gay (plane).jpg|thumb|''[[Enola Gay]]'' maneuvers into position at a hardstand upon returning to base following the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]].]]
Hardstands are paved with materials including [[Pavement (architecture) | concrete heavy duty pavers]] which give a lot of maintenance flexibility over other products as well as strength for the life of the project or [[asphalt]]/[[macadam]].  The paving is usually designed to be thicker and more durable than drives, city [[street]]s, or automobile [[parking lot]]s in order to support the weight of heavy vehicles such as large [[airplane]]s, [[tank]]s, or heavy [[truck]]s.

[[File:Regular_hexagon_as_intersection_of_two_triangles.png|thumb|A regular ''hexagram'', [[List_of_regular_polytopes_and_compounds#Two_dimensional_compounds|{6}[2{3}]{6}]], can be seen as a [[compound polygon|compound]] composed of an upwards (blue here) and downwards (pink) facing [[equilateral triangle]], with their intersection as a regular [[hexagon]] (in green).]]
A '''hexagram''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]) or '''sexagram''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]) is a six-pointed geometric [[star figure]] with the [[Schläfli symbol]] {6/2}, 2{3}, or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Since there are no true regular continuous hexagrams, the term is instead used to refer to the compound figure of two [[equilateral triangle]]s shown to the right. The intersection is a regular [[hexagon]].

The hexagram is part of an infinite series of shapes which are compounds of two n-dimensional [[simplex|simplices]]. In three dimensions, [[Compound of two tetrahedra|the analogous compound]] is the [[stellated octahedron]], and in four dimensions the [[compound of two 5-cells]] is obtained.

It has been historically used in religious and cultural contexts and as decorative motifs; for example by medieval [[Muslims]], especially [[Hanafi]] and [[Maliki]] dynasties,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Delhi: Adventures in a Megacity]]'' (PB) - Page 91, Sam Miller, Sam - 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and later in [[Judaism]] and [[occultism]]. The symbol was used merely as a decorative motif in medieval Christian churches many centuries before its first known use in a Jewish synagogue.{{sfn|Scholem|1949|p=244|ps=:"It is not to be found at all in medieval synagogues or on medieval ceremonial objects, although it has been found in quite a number of medieval Christian churches again, not as a Christian symbol but only as a decorative motif. The appearance of the symbol in Christian churches long before its appearance in our synagogues should warn the overzealous interpreters. "}} It was first used as a religious symbol by Arabs in the medieval period, known as the [[Seal of Solomon]], depicted as either a hexagram or [[pentagram]], and which was later adopted by Jewish [[Kabbalists]].{{sfn|Scholem|1949|p=246|ps=:"In the beginning these designs had no special names or terms, and it is only in the Middle Ages that definite names began to be given to some of those most widely used. There is very little doubt that terms like these first became popular among the Arabs, who showed a tremendous interest in all the occult sciences, arranging and ordering them systematically long before the Practical Cabalists thought of doing so.{{pb}}It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that for a long time both the five-pointed and the six-pointed stars were called by one name, the "Seal of Solomon," and that no distinction was made between them. This name is obviously related to the Jewish legend of Solomon's dominion over the spirits, and of his ring with the Ineffable Name engraved on it. These legends expanded and proliferated in a marked fashion during the Middle Ages, among Jews and Arabs alike, but the name, "Seal of Solomon," apparently originated with the Arabs."}}&lt;ref&gt;Leonora Leet, "The Hexagram and Hebraic Sacred Science" in :''The Secret Doctrine of the Kabbalah'', 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=61hpoogearsC&amp;pg=PA212 pp. 212-217].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Group theory==
In [[mathematics]], the [[root system]] for the simple [[Lie group]] [[G2 (mathematics)|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] is in the form of a hexagram, with six long roots and six short roots.&lt;br/&gt;
[[File:Root system G2.svg|250px]]

== Construction by compass and a straight edge ==
A six-pointed star, like a [[regular hexagon]], can be created using a compass and a straight edge:
*Make a circle of any size with the compass.
*Without changing the radius of the compass, set its pivot on the circle's circumference, and find one of the two points where a new circle would intersect the first circle.
*With the pivot on the last point found, similarly find a third point on the circumference, and repeat until six such points have been marked.
*With a straight edge, join alternate points on the circumference to form two overlapping equilateral triangles.

== Construction by linear algebra ==
[[File:Hexagram-cube.png|thumb]]
A regular hexagram can be constructed by [[orthographic projection|orthographically projecting]] any [[cube]] onto a plane through three vertices that are all adjacent to the same vertex.  The twelve midpoints to edges of the cube form a hexagram.  For example, consider the projection of the unit cube with vertices at the eight possible binary vectors in three dimensions &lt;math&gt;(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1),(1,1,1)&lt;/math&gt; onto the plane &lt;math&gt;x+y+z=1&lt;/math&gt;.  The midpoints are &lt;math&gt;(0,0,1/2),(0,1/2,1/2),(0,1,1/2),(1,1,1/2)&lt;/math&gt;, and all points resulting from these by applying a permutation to their entries.  These 12 points project to a hexagram: six vertices around the outer hexagon and six on the inner.

==Origins and shape==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2009}}
It is possible that as a simple geometric shape, like for example the triangle, circle, or square, the hexagram has been created by various peoples with no connection to one another.

The hexagram is a [[mandala]] symbol called ''satkona yantra'' or ''sadkona yantra'' found on ancient South [[India]]n [[Hindu]] temples. It symbolizes the [[nara-narayana]], or perfect [[meditative]] state of balance achieved between Man and God, and if maintained, results in "[[moksha]]," or "[[nirvana]]" (release from the bounds of the earthly world and its material trappings).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Some researchers have theorized that the hexagram represents the [[astrological]] chart at the time of David's birth or [[anointment]] as king. The hexagram is also known as the "King's Star" in astrological circles.

In antique [[papyri]], [[pentagram]]s, together with stars and other signs, are frequently found on [[amulet]]s bearing the Jewish names of [[God]], and used to guard against fever and other diseases. Curiously the hexagram is not found among these signs. In the [[Greek Magical Papyri]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} (Wessely, l.c. pp.&amp;nbsp;31, 112) at Paris and London there are 22 signs side by side, and a circle with twelve signs, but neither a pentagram nor a hexagram.

==Usage in Dharmic religions==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Jain Cosmology0007small.JPG|thumb|Diagram showing the two mystic syllables Om and Hrim]]
Six-pointed stars have also been found in cosmological diagrams in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]. The reasons behind this symbol's common appearance in Indic religions and the West are unknown. One possibility is that they have a common origin. The other possibility is that artists and religious people from several cultures independently created the hexagram shape, which is a relatively simple geometric design.

Within Indic lore, the shape is generally understood to consist of two triangles—one pointed up and the other down—locked in harmonious embrace. The two components are called "Om" and the "Hrim" in Sanskrit, and symbolize man's position between earth and sky. The downward triangle symbolizes [[Shakti]], the sacred embodiment of femininity, and the upward triangle symbolizes [[Shiva]], or [[Agni Tattva]], representing the focused aspects of masculinity. The mystical union of the two triangles represents Creation, occurring through the divine union of male and female. The two locked triangles are also known as 'Shanmukha'—the six-faced, representing the six faces of Shiva &amp; Shakti's progeny [[Kartikeya]]. This symbol is also a part of several yantras and has deep significance in Hindu ritual worship and history.

In [[Buddhism]], some old versions of the [[Bardo Thodol]], also known as The "Tibetan Book of the Dead", contain a hexagram with a [[Swastika]] inside. It was made up by the publishers for this particular publication. In Tibetan, it is called the "origin of phenomenon" (chos-kyi 'byung-gnas). It is especially connected with [[Vajrayogini]], and forms the center part of Her [[mandala]]. In reality, it is in three dimensions, not two, although it may be portrayed either way.

The [[Shatkona]] is a symbol used in [[Hindu]] [[yantra]] that represents the union of both the [[male]] and [[Female|feminine]] form. More specifically it is supposed to represent [[Purusha]] (the supreme being), and [[Prakriti]] (mother nature, or causal matter). Often this is represented as [[Shiva]] - [[Shakti]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sivasakti.com/articles/intro-yantra.html sivasakti.com: ''Iintroduction to Yantra'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shatkona is a hexagram and looks exactly like the [[Star of David]].

===Anahata: The Heart Chakra===

|width=170 valign=top|[[File:Anahata Mandala.svg|center|170px]]
|valign=top|'''[[Anahata]]''' (also known as '''Anahata-puri''', or '''Padma-sundara''') is symbolized by a lotus flower with twelve petals. (See also [[bodhicitta|heartmind]]). Anahata is related to the colors green or pink. Key issues involving Anahata involve complex emotions, compassion, tenderness, unconditional love, equilibrium, rejection and well-being. Physically Anahata governs circulation, emotionally it governs unconditional love for the self and others, mentally it governs passion, and spiritually it governs devotion.&lt;ref&gt;The Chakra Bible, Patricia Mercier, Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., 2007, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;
|-

In the [[endocrine system]], [[Anahata]] is associated with the [[thymus]] gland, located in the chest. This gland produces [[T-cells]], that combat disease, and bring equilibrium to the body. The functioning of the [[thymus]] is greatest before [[puberty]] and is impaired by the appearance of [[sex hormones]] in the blood stream from [[puberty]] onwards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==Usage by the Abrahamic religions==

===Usage by Jews===
{{Main|Star of David}}
[[File:Leningrad Codex Carpet page e.jpg|thumb|The Star of David in the oldest surviving complete copy of the [[Masoretic text]], the [[Leningrad Codex]], dated 1008.]]
The ''Magen David'' is a generally recognized symbol of Judaism and Jewish identity and is also known colloquially as the Jewish Star or "Star of David." Its usage as a sign of Jewish identity began in the Middle Ages, though its religious usage began earlier, with the current earliest archeological evidence being a stone bearing the shield from the arch of a 3–4th century synagogue in the Galilee.&lt;ref&gt;"King Solomon's Seal", ''MFA'', [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/King%20Solomon-s%20Seal King Solomon-s Seal].&lt;/ref&gt; A more enduring symbol of Judaism, the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], has been in use since about 1300 BC according to the [[Torah]] {{bibleverse||Exodus|25:31-40|HE}}.

===Usage by Christians===
The hexagram may be found in some Churches and stained-glass windows. In Christianity it is sometimes called the star of creation.  A very early example, noted by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], can be found in [[Winchester Cathedral]], England in one of the canopies of the choir stalls, circa 1308.&lt;ref&gt;Buildings of England: Hampshire and the North (now second edition) {{ISBN|978 0 300 12084 4}}, p.604. &lt;/ref&gt;

In Balkan countries, hexagrams can be found more often in Orthodox Christian churches than in Roman Catholic churches.  
 
====Latter-day Saints (Mormons)====
[[File:Salt Lake Assembly Hall Star of David.jpg|thumb|Star of David on the [[Salt Lake Assembly Hall]]]]
{{Main|Mormonism and Judaism}}
The Star of David is also used less prominently by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in the temples and in architecture. It symbolizes God reaching down to man and man reaching up to God, the union of Heaven and earth. It may also symbolize the [[Israelite|Tribes of Israel]] and friendship and their affinity towards the Jewish people. Additionally, it is sometimes used to symbolize the quorum of the twelve apostles, as in Revelation 12, wherein the Church of God is symbolized by a woman wearing a crown of twelve stars. It is also sometimes used to symbolize the Big Dipper, which points to the North Star, a symbol of Jesus Christ.

====Rastafari====
A black star of David is used to identify the black population, in Africa or otherwise, with one of the [[Israelite|Tribes of Israel]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
Due to the culture of Rastafari emerging out of the Judeo-Christian Ethiopian history, dating back to Solomonic dynastic rule, the star of David, or the Seal of Solomon is a prevalent symbol amongst its adherents. Rastafari has adherents from every race across the globe, rooted in Christian doctrine, it is not an African or bloodline doctrine.

===Usage by Muslims===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The symbol is known in Arabic as ''Khātem Sulaymān'' ([[Seal of Solomon]]; {{lang|ar|خاتم سليمان}}) or ''Najmat Dāwūd'' ([[Star of David]]; {{lang|ar|نجمة داوود}}). The "Seal of Solomon" may also be represented by a five-pointed star or [[pentagram]].

In the [[Qur'an]], it is written that David and [[King Solomon]] (Arabic, ''Suliman'' or ''Sulayman'') were prophets and kings, and are figures revered by Muslims. The Medieval pre-Ottoman [[Hanafi]] [[Anatolian beyliks]] of the [[Karamanids]] and [[Jandarids]] used the star on their flag.&lt;ref name="Muwahhidists"&gt;The Muslim Empires of the Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, By Stephen F. Dale, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol also used on [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] flag. Today the six-pointed star can be found in [[mosques]] and on other [[Arabic Art|Arabic]] and [[Islamic art]]ifacts.

Professor [[Gershom Sholem|Gershom Scholem]] theorizes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-curious-history-of-the-six-pointed-starhow-the-magen-david-became-the-jewish-symbol/|title=The Curious History of the Six-Pointed Star:How the “Magen David” Became the Jewish Symbol - Commentary Magazine|work=Commentary Magazine|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the "Star of David" originates in the writings of [[Aristotle]], who used triangles in different positions to indicate the different basic elements. The superposed triangles thus represented combinations of those elements. From Aristotle's writings those symbols made their ways into early, pre-Muslim Arab literature.

==Usage in heraldry==
In [[heraldry]] and [[vexillology]], a hexagram is a fairly common charge employed, though it is rarely called by this name. In Germanic regions it is known simply as a "star." In English and French heraldry, however, the hexagram is known as a "mullet of six points," where ''mullet'' is a French term for a [[spur|spur rowel]] which is shown with five pointed arms by default unless otherwise specified. In [[Albania]]n heraldry and vexillology, hexagram has been used since [[classical antiquity]] and it is commonly referred to as ''sixagram''. [[:File:Coa Kastrioti Family.svg|Coa Kastrioti Family]] of the [[House of Kastrioti]] depicts the hexagram on a '''[[pile (heraldry)|pile]]''' argent over the double headed eagle. A hexagram also appears on the '''Dardania''' Flag, proposed for [[Kosovo]] by the [[Democratic League of Kosovo]].

==Usage in theosophy==
The Star of David is used in the seal and the emblem of the [[Theosophical Society]] (founded in 1875). Although it is more pronounced, it is used along with other religious symbols. These include the [[Swastika]], the [[Ankh]], the [[Om|Aum]], and the [[Ouroboros]]. The star of David is also known as the Seal of Solomon that was its original name until around 50 years ago.

==Usage in occultism==
The hexagram, like the [[pentagram]], was and is used in practices of the [[occult]] and [[ceremonial magic]] and is attributed to the 7 "old" planets outlined in [[astrology]].

The six-pointed star is commonly used both as a [[talisman]]&lt;ref&gt;P299 (and throughout) of ''The Complete Goldendawn'' by Israel Regardie. {{ISBN|978-0875426631}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for conjuring spirits and spiritual forces in diverse forms of [[Magic (paranormal)|occult magic]]. In the book [[The History and Practice of Magic, Vol. 2]], the six-pointed star is called the talisman of Saturn and it is also referred to as the Seal of Solomon.&lt;ref&gt;"The History and Practice of Magic" (Secaucus, NJ: University Books, published by arrangement with Lyle Stewart, 1979), Vol. II, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Details are given in this book on how to make these symbols and the materials to use.
[[File:Star of David GGNC grave marker engraving.JPG|thumb|200x200px|Double hexagram.]]
Traditionally, the Hexagram can be seen as the combination of the four elements. Fire is symbolized as an upwards pointing triangle, while Air (its elemental opposite) is also an upwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. Water is symbolized as a downwards pointing triangle, while Earth (its elemental opposite) is also a downwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. When you combine the symbols of Fire and Water, a hexagram (six-pointed star) is created. The same follows for when you combine the symbols of Air and Earth.  When you combine both hexagrams, you get the double-hexagram. Thus, a combination of the elements is created.&lt;ref&gt;P315-316 of ''The Wicca Bible'' by Ann-Marie Gallagher. {{ISBN|978-1-84181-250-2}}. Same information also found in many other books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] Magic, the seven Traditional Planets correspond with the angles and the center of the Hexagram as follows, in the same patterns as they appear on the [[Sephiroth]] and on the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. Saturn, although formally attributed to the Sephira of [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]], within this frame work nonetheless occupies the position of [[Da'at (Kabbalah)|Daath]].&lt;ref&gt;P31 of ''The Ritual Magic Manual: A Complete Course in Practical Magic'' by David Griffin. {{ISBN|978-0965840897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in Freemasonry==
{{quote|"The interlacing triangles or deltas symbolize the union of the two principles or forces, the active and passive, male and female, pervading the universe ... The two triangles, one white and the other black, interlacing, typify the mingling of apparent opposites in nature, darkness and light, error and truth, ignorance and wisdom, evil and good, throughout human life." –&amp;nbsp;Albert G. Mackey: ''Encyclopedia of [[Freemason]]ry''}}

The hexagram is featured within and on the outside of many [[Masonic temple]]s as a decoration. It may have been found within the structures of [[King Solomon]]'s temple, from which [[Freemasons]] are inspired in their philosophies and studies. Like many other symbols in Freemasonry, the deciphering of the hexagram is non-dogmatic and left to the interpretation of the individual.

* In [[alchemy]], the two triangles represent the reconciliation of the opposites of fire and water. Non-Jewish Kabbalah (also called Christian or Hermetic Kabbalah) interprets{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} the hexagram to mean the divine union of male and female energy, where the male is represented by the upper triangle and the female by the lower one. Moreover, it derives four triangular symbols from it (two triangles crossed like a capital letter A and two uncrossed) to represent the four elements: water, fire, air, and earth. This use of the symbol was used as an important plot point in [[Dan Brown]]'s popular novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and [[Da Vinci Code (film)|the ''Da Vinci Code'' film]] cites this as the origin of the star.
* It was also used as a sign for [[Aether (classical element)#Fifth element|quintessence]], the fifth element.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* In southern Germany the hexagram can be found as part of tavern anchors. It is symbol for the tapping of beer and sign of the brewer's guild. In German this is called "Bierstern" (beer star) or "[[:de:Brauerstern|Brauerstern]]" (brewer's star).
* A six-point star is used as an identifying mark of the [[Folk Nation]].
* The main runways and taxiways of [[Heathrow Airport]] were arranged roughly in the shape of a hexagram.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44490000/gif/_44490901_heathrow_man_4165.gif bbc.co.uk] and see [[:File:Aerial photograph of Heathrow Airport, 1955.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A hexagram in a circle is incorporated prominently in the supports of [[Worthing railway station]]'s platform 2 canopy (UK).&lt;ref&gt;

Additionally, every year at Christmastime the residents of El Tejar erect a giant fake Christmas tree in front of their municipal building, with a hexagram sitting at its peak.
* The Indian sage and seer [[Sri Aurobindo]] used it—e.g. on the cover of his books—as a symbol of the aspiration of humanity calling to the Divine to descend into life (the triangle with the point at the top), and the descent of the Divine into the earth's atmosphere and all individuals in response to that calling (the triangle with the point at the bottom). (This was explained by the Mother, his spiritual partner in Her 14-volume Agenda and elsewhere by Sri Aurobindo in his writings.){{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* A strange storm on the north pole of Saturn appears to be roughly in the shape of a hexagram.

{{Anthropology }}

'''History of anthropology'scientific word during the [[Renaissance]], has always meant "the study (or science) of man". The topics to be included and the terminology have varied historically. At present they are more elaborate than they were during the development of anthropology. For a presentation of modern social and cultural anthropology as they have developed in Britain, France, and North America since approximately 1900, see the relevant sections under [[Anthropology]].

==Etymology==
The term ''[[wiktionary:anthropology|anthropology]]'' ostensibly is a produced compound of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἄνθρωπος}} ''anthrōpos'', "human being" (understood to mean "humankind" or "humanity"), and a supposed -λογία ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'', "study".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=-logy | work=Online Etymological Dictionary | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=-logy&amp;allowed_in_frame=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compound, however, is unknown in ancient Greek or Latin, whether classical or mediaeval. It first appears sporadically in the scholarly Latin ''anthropologia'' of Renaissance France, where it spawns the French word ''anthropologie'', transferred into English as anthropology. It does belong to a class of words produced with the [[-logy]] suffix, such as archeo-logy, bio-logy, etc., "the study (or science) of".

The mixed character of Greek ''anthropos'' and Latin ''-logia'' marks it as [[New Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=-logy | encyclopedia=Webster's Third New International Dictionary Unabridged and Seven Language Dictionary | volume=II H to R | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no independent noun, logia, however, of that meaning in classical Greek. The word λόγος ([[logos]]) has that meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liddell|Scott|1940|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos logos]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]] attempted to rescue the etymology in his first address to the [[Anthropological Society of London]] as president and founder, 1863. He did find an ''anthropologos'' from Aristotle in the standard [[A Greek–English Lexicon|ancient Greek Lexicon]], which he says defines the word as "speaking or treating of man".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|1863|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is entirely wishful thinking, as Liddell and Scott go on to explain the meaning: "i.e. fond of personal conversation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liddell|Scott|1940|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aalphabetic+letter%3D*a%3Aentry+group%3D178%3Aentry%3Da%29nqrwpolo%2Fgos anthropologos]}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Aristotle, the very philosopher of the logos, could produce such a word without serious intent, there probably was at that time no anthropology identifiable under that name.

The lack of any ancient denotation of anthropology, however, is not an etymological problem. Liddell and Scott list 170 Greek compounds ending in ''–logia'', enough to justify its later use as a productive suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liddell|Scott|1940|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=end&amp;lookup=logia&amp;lang=greek logia]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greeks often used suffixes in forming compounds that had no independent variant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buck|1933|p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etymological dictionaries are united in attributing ''–logia'' to ''logos'', from ''legein'', "to collect". The thing collected is primarily ideas, especially in speech. The [[American Heritage Dictionary]] says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=leg- | encyclopedia=[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] | edition=4th | chapter=Appendix I: Indo-European Roots | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "(It is one of) derivatives independently built to logos." Its morphological type is that of an abstract noun: log-os &gt; log-ia (a "qualitative abstract")&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buck|1933|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] origin of the name of anthropology does not exclude the possibility that ancient authors presented anthropogical material under another name (see below). Such an identification is speculative, depending on the theorist's view of anthropology; nevertheless, speculations have been formulated by credible anthropologists, especially those that consider themselves [[Structural functionalism|functionalists]] and others in history so classified now.

==The science of history==
[[Marvin Harris]], a historian of anthropology, begins ''The Rise of Anthropological Theory'' with the statement that anthropology is "the science of history".&lt;ref name=Harris1&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is not suggesting that [[history]] be renamed to anthropology, or that there is no distinction between history and [[prehistory]], or that anthropology excludes current social practices, as the general meaning of history, which it has in "history of anthropology", would seem to imply. He is using "history" in a special sense, as the founders of [[cultural anthropology]] used it:&lt;ref&gt;There is currently some regional and traditional equivocation about whether it should be called culture history, as in [[cultural anthropology]]; i.e., [[Culture-historical archaeology]], or [[social history]], as in [[social anthropology]], or the compromise, [[sociocultural anthropology]]. Different theorists have different practices, the distinctions being mainly verbal.&lt;/ref&gt; "the natural history of society", in the words of [[Herbert Spencer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the "universal history of mankind", the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment]] objective.&lt;ref name=Harris1/&gt; Just as [[natural history]] comprises the characteristics of organisms past and present, so cultural or social history comprises the characteristics of society past and present. It includes both documented history and prehistory, but its slant is toward institutional development rather than particular non-repeatable historical events.

According to Harris, the 19th-century anthropologists were theorizing under the presumption that the development of society followed some sort of laws. He decries the loss of that view in the 20th century by the denial that any laws are discernable or that current institutions have any bearing on ancient. He coins the term ideographic for them. The 19th-century views, on the other hand, are [[nomothetic]]; that is, they provide laws. He intends "to reassert the methodological priority of the search for the laws of history in the science of man".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is looking for "a general theory of history".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His perception of the laws: "I believe that the analogue of the Darwinian strategy in the realm of sociocultural phenomena is the principle of techno-environmental and techno-economic determinism", he calls [[Cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]], which he also details in ''Cultural Materialism: The Struggle for a Science of Culture.''

Elsewhere he refers to "my theories of historical determinism", defining the latter: "By a deterministic relationship among cultural phenomena, I mean merely that similar variables under similar conditions tend to give rise to similar consequences."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1991|pp=xii-xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "tends to" implies some degree of freedom to happen or not happen, but in strict [[determinism]], given certain causes, the result and only that result must occur. Different philosophers, however, use determinism in different senses. The deterministic element that Harris sees is lack of human social engineering: "free will and moral choice have had virtually no significant effect upon the direction taken thus far by evolving systems of social life."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1991|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris agrees with the 19th-century view that laws are [[abstraction]]s from [[empirical evidence]]: "...sociocultural entities are constructed from the direct or indirect observation of the behavior and thought of specific individuals&amp;nbsp;...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1999|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions are not a physical reality; only people are. When they act in society, they do so according to the laws of history, of which they are not aware; hence, there is no historical element of free will. Like the 20th-century anthropologists in general, Harris places a high value on the empiricism, or collection of data. This function must be performed by trained observers.

He borrows terms from linguistics: just as a [[phonetics|phon-'''etic''' system]] is a description of sounds developed without regard to the meaning and structure of the language, while a [[phoneme|phon-'''emic''']] system describes the meaningful sounds actually used within the language, so anthropological data can be [[emic and etic]]. Only trained observers can avoid eticism, or description without regard to the meaning in the culture: "...&amp;nbsp;etics are in part observers' emics incorrectly applied to a foreign system...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1999|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He makes a further distinction between [[Synchrony and diachrony|synchronic and diachronic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synchronic ("same time") with reference to anthropological data is contemporaneous and cross-cultural. Diachronic ("through time") data shows the development of lines through time. Cultural materialism, being a "processually holistic and globally comparative scientific research strategy" must depend for accuracy on all four types of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1999|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural materialism differs from the others by the insertion of culture as the effect. Different material factors produce different cultures.

Harris, like many other anthropologists, in looking for anthropological method and data before the use of the term anthropology, had little difficulty finding them among the ancient authors. The ancients tended to see players on the stage of history as ethnic groups characterized by the same or similar languages and customs: the Persians, the Germans, the Scythians, etc. Thus the term history meant to a large degree the "story" of the fortunes of these players through time. The ancient authors never formulated laws. Apart from a rudimentary [[three-age system]], the stages of history, such as are found in Lubbock, Tylor, Morgan, Marx and others, are yet unformulated.

==Proto-anthropology==
Eriksen and Nielsen use the term proto-anthropology to refer to near-anthropological writings, which contain some of the criteria for being anthropology, but not all. They classify proto-anthropology as being "travel writing or social philosophy", going on to assert "It is only when these aspects&amp;nbsp;... are fused, that is, when data and theory are brought together, that anthropology appears."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Thomas Hylland | last1=Eriksen | first2=Finn Sivert | last2=Nielsen | title=A History of Anthropology | edition=2nd | series=Anthropology, Culture and Society Series | location=London | publisher=Pluto Press | year=1013 | pages=10–12 | url=http://hyllanderiksen.net/History2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process began to occur in the 18th century of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

===Classical Age===
Many anthropological writers find anthropological-quality theorizing in the works of [[Classical Greece]] and [[Classical Rome]]; for example, [[John Myres]] in ''Herodotus and Anthropology'' (1908); E. E. Sikes in ''The Anthropology of the Greeks'' (1914); [[Clyde Kluckhohn]] in ''Anthropology and the Classics'' (1961), and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jonathan Z. | last=Smith | title=Map is Not Territory: Studies in the History of Religions | location=Chicage | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year=1993 | page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; An equally long list may be found in French and German as well as other languages.

====Herodotus====
[[Herodotus]] was a 5th-century BC Greek historian who set about to chronicle and explain the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] that transpired early in that century. He did so in a surviving work conventionally termed ''the History'' or ''the Histories''. His first line begins: "These are the researches of Herodotus of Halicarnassus&amp;nbsp;...."

The [[Achaemenid Empire]], deciding to bring Greece into its domain, conducted a massive invasion across the [[Bosphorus]] using multi-cultural troops raised from many different locations. They were decisively defeated by the Greek city-states. Herodotus was far from interested in only the non-repeatable events. He provides ethnic details and histories of the peoples within the empire and to the north of it, in most cases being the first to do so. His methods were reading accounts, interviewing witnesses, and in some cases taking notes for himself.

These "researches" have been considered anthropological since at least as early as the late 19th century. The title, "Father of History" (''pater historiae''), had been conferred on him probably by [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=François | last=Hartog | title=The mirror of Herodotus : the representation of the other in the writing of history | series=New historicism, 5. | year=1988 | location=Berkeley | publisher=University of California Press | page=379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pointing out that [[John Myres]] in 1908 had believed that Herodotus was an anthropologist on a par with those of his own day, [[James M. Redfield]] asserts: "Herodotus, as we know, was both Father of History and Father of Anthropology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=James M. | last=Redfield | title=Herodotus the Tourist | journal=Classical Philology | year=1985 | volume=80 | pages=97–118 | url=https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/class3676/secure/Redfield.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus calls his method of travelling around taking notes "theorizing". Redfield translates it as "tourism" with a scientific intent. He identifies three terms of Herodotus as overlapping on culture: ''diaitia'', material goods such as houses and consumables; ''[[Ethos|ethea]]'', the mores or customs; and ''nomoi'', the authoritative precedents or [[law]]s.

====Tacitus====
The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historian, [[Tacitus]], wrote many of our only surviving contemporary accounts of several ancient [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples]].

===Middle Ages===

Another candidate for one of the first scholars to carry out comparative ethnographic-type studies in person was the medieval [[Persian people|Persian]] scholar [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]] in the eleventh century, who wrote about the peoples, customs, and religions of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. According to Akbar S. Ahmed, like modern anthropologists, he engaged in extensive [[participant observation]] with a given group of people, learnt their language and studied their primary texts, and presented his findings with [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] and [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]] using [[Cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparisons]].&lt;ref name=Ahmed&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ahmed | first1 = Akbar S. | year = 1984 | title = Al-Beruni: The First Anthropologist | url = | journal = RAIN | volume = 60 | issue = 60| pages = 9–10 | doi = 10.2307/3033407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue, however, that he hardly can be considered an anthropologist in the conventional sense.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tapper (1995). "Islamic Anthropology" and the "Anthropology of Islam", ''Anthropological Quarterly'' '''68''' (3), Anthropological Analysis and Islamic Texts, p. 185-193.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote detailed comparative studies on the religions and cultures in the [[Middle East]], [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]], and especially [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1353/jhi.1998.0030 | last1 = Walbridge | first1 = J. T. | year = 1998 | title = Explaining Away the Greek Gods in Islam | url = | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 59 | issue = 3| pages = 389–403 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tapper (1995). "Islamic Anthropology" and the "Anthropology of Islam", ''Anthropological Quarterly'' 68 (3), Anthropological Analysis and Islamic Texts, p. 185-193.&lt;/ref&gt; Biruni's tradition of comparative cross-cultural study continued in the [[Muslim world]] through to [[Ibn Khaldun]]'s work in the fourteenth century.&lt;ref name=Ahmed/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorq.org/Articles/article.aspx?d=2002&amp;x=arabviews West Asian views on black Africans during the medieval era]&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval scholars may be considered forerunners of modern anthropology as well, insofar as they conducted or wrote detailed studies of the customs of peoples considered "different" from themselves in terms of geography. [[John of Plano Carpini]] reported of his stay among the [[Mongols]]. His report was unusual in its detailed depiction of a non-European culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timothyjpmason.com/WebPages/Publications/Source_pages/AnthroHist.htm Resources for a History of Anthropology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231041925/http://www.timothyjpmason.com/WebPages/Publications/Source_pages/AnthroHist.htm |date=2012-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marco Polo]]'s systematic observations of nature, anthropology, and geography are another example of studying human variation across space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tk421.net/essays/polo.html Marco Polo's Asia]&lt;/ref&gt; Polo's travels took him across such a diverse human landscape and his accounts of the peoples he met as he journeyed were so detailed that they earned for Polo the name "the father of modern anthropology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/sections/gad/history/011rowe.pdf The Renaissance Foundations of Anthropology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904194548/http://www.aaanet.org/sections/gad/history/011rowe.pdf |date=2012-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
{{See also|Bernardino de Sahagún}}
The first use of the term "anthropology" in English to refer to a natural science of humanity was apparently in [[Richard Harvey (astrologer)|Richard Harvey's]] 1593 ''Philadelphus, a defense of the legend of Brutus in British history'', which, includes the passage: "Genealogy or issue which they had, Artes which they studied, Actes which they did. This part of History is named Anthropology."

==The Enlightenment roots of the discipline==
[[File: Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|left|220px|Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)]]

Many scholars consider modern anthropology as an outgrowth of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] (1715–89),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=8407 http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=8407]&lt;/ref&gt; a period when Europeans attempted to study human behavior systematically, the known varieties of which had been increasing since the fifteenth century as a result of the [[first European colonization wave (15th century–19th century)|first European colonization wave]]. The traditions of [[jurisprudence]], history, [[philology]], and [[sociology]] then evolved into something more closely resembling the modern views of these disciplines and informed the development of the [[social sciences]], of which anthropology was a part.

It took [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724-1804) 25 years to write one of the first major treatises on anthropology, ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' (1798), which treats it as a branch of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. "Introduction" to his 1961 translation of Kant's work, reprinted, [http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpfoucault1.htm Generation-online.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Kant is not generally considered to be a modern anthropologist, as he never left his region of Germany, nor did he study any cultures besides his own.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Brian, and Kain, Patrick (eds.), Essays on Kant's Anthropology, Cambridge University Press, 2003, 278pp., {{ISBN|0-521-79038-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, begin teaching an annual course in anthropology in 1772.
Developments in the systematic study of ancient civilizations through the disciplines of [[Classics]] and [[Egyptology]] informed both archaeology and eventually social anthropology, as did the study of East and South Asian languages and cultures. At the same time, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers, such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/sstopics/slovaklawsonlanguage/Herder_on_Language.pdf | title = Herder on Language | last = Votruba | first = Martin | work = Slovak Studies Program | publisher = University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], whose work formed the basis for the "culture concept", which is central to the discipline.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Institutionally, anthropology emerged from the development of [[natural history]] (expounded by authors such as [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]) that occurred during the European colonization of the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Programs of ethnographic study originated in this era as the study of the "human primitives" overseen by colonial administrations.

There was a tendency in late eighteenth century Enlightenment thought to understand human society as natural phenomena that behaved according to certain principles and that could be observed empirically. In some ways, studying the language, culture, physiology, and artifacts of European colonies was not unlike studying the flora and fauna of those places.

Early anthropology was divided between proponents of [[unilineal evolution|unilinealism]], who argued that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process, from the most primitive to the most advanced, and various forms of non-lineal theorists, who tended to subscribe to ideas such as [[diffusionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. (1968) Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology. London: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Most nineteenth-century social theorists, including anthropologists, viewed non-European societies as windows onto the pre-industrial human past.

==Overview of the modern discipline==
Marxist anthropologist [[Eric Wolf]] once characterized anthropology as "the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the social sciences". Understanding how [[anthropology]] developed contributes to understanding how it fits into other academic disciplines.
Scholarly traditions of [[jurisprudence]], history, [[philology]] and [[sociology]] developed during this time and informed the development of the [[social sciences]] of which anthropology was a part. At the same time, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers such as [[Herder]] and later [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] whose work formed the basis for the culture concept which is central to the discipline.

These intellectual movements in part grappled with one of the greatest paradoxes of [[modernity]]: as the world is becoming smaller and more integrated, people's experience of the world is increasingly atomized and dispersed. As [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] observed in the 1840s:

{{Quotation|All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new industries, whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilized nations, by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter of the globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal interdependence of nations.}}

Ironically, this universal interdependence, rather than leading to greater human solidarity, has coincided with increasing racial, ethnic, religious, and class divisions, and new—and to some confusing or disturbing—cultural expressions. These are the conditions of life with which people today must contend, but they have their origins in processes that began in the 16th century and accelerated in the 19th century.

Institutionally anthropology emerged from [[natural history]] (expounded by authors such as [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]). This was the study of human beings—typically people living in European colonies. Thus studying the language, culture, physiology, and artifacts of European colonies was more or less equivalent to studying the flora and fauna of those places. It was for this reason, for instance, that [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] could write monographs on both ''The League of the Iroquois'' and ''The American Beaver and His Works''. This is also why the material culture of 'civilized' nations such as China have historically been displayed in fine arts museums alongside European art while artifacts from Africa or Native North American cultures were displayed in [[natural history museum]]s with dinosaur bones and nature dioramas. Curatorial practice has changed dramatically in recent years, and it would be wrong to see anthropology as merely an extension of colonial rule and European [[chauvinism]], since its relationship to [[imperialism]] was and is complex.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Drawing on the methods of the [[natural science]]s as well as developing new techniques involving not only structured interviews but unstructured "participant-observation"—and drawing on the new [[theory of evolution]] through [[natural selection]], they proposed the scientific study of a new object: "humankind", conceived of as a whole. Crucial to this study is the concept "culture", which anthropologists defined both as a universal capacity and propensity for social learning, thinking, and acting (which they see as a product of human evolution and something that distinguishes Homo sapiens—and perhaps all species of genus ''[[Hominoid|Homo]]''—from other species), and as a particular adaptation to local conditions that takes the form of highly variable beliefs and practices. Thus, "culture" not only transcends the opposition between nature and nurture; it transcends and absorbs the peculiarly European distinction between politics, religion, kinship, and the economy as autonomous domains. Anthropology thus transcends the divisions between the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities to explore the biological, linguistic, material, and symbolic dimensions of humankind in all forms.

==National anthropological traditions==
{{Main|History of anthropology by country}}

As academic disciplines began to differentiate over the course of the nineteenth century, anthropology grew increasingly distinct from the biological approach of natural history, on the one hand, and from purely historical or literary fields such as Classics, on the other. A common criticism was that many social sciences (such as economists, sociologists, and psychologists) in Western countries focused disproportionately on Western subjects, while anthropology focuseed disproportionately on the "other".&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, James and George E. Marcus (1986) Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
Museums such as the [[British Museum]] weren't the only site of anthropological studies: with the [[New Imperialism]] period, starting in the 1870s, [[zoo]]s became unattended "laboratories", especially the so-called "ethnological exhibitions" or "Negro villages". Thus, "savages" from the colonies were displayed, often nudes, in cages, in what has been called "[[human zoos]]". For example, in 1906, Congolese [[pygmy]] [[Ota Benga]] was put by anthropologist [[Madison Grant]] in a cage in the [[Bronx Zoo]], labelled "the missing link" between an orangutan and the "white race"—Grant, a renowned [[eugenicist]], was also the author of ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' (1916). Such exhibitions were attempts to illustrate and prove in the same movement the validity of [[scientific racism]], which first formulation may be found in [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of Human Races]]'' (1853–55). In 1931, the [[Colonial Exhibition]] in Paris still displayed [[Kanaks]] from [[New Caledonia]] in the "indigenous village"; it received 24&amp;nbsp;million visitors in six months, thus demonstrating the popularity of such "human zoos".

Anthropology grew increasingly distinct from natural history and by the end of the nineteenth century the discipline began to crystallize into its modern form—by 1935, for example, it was possible for T.K. Penniman to write a history of the discipline entitled ''A Hundred Years of Anthropology''. At the time, the field was dominated by 'the comparative method'. It was assumed that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process from the most primitive to most advanced. Non-European societies were thus seen as evolutionary 'living fossils' that could be studied in order to understand the European past. Scholars wrote histories of prehistoric migrations which were sometimes valuable but often also fanciful. It was during this time that Europeans first accurately traced [[Polynesia]]n migrations across the [[Pacific Ocean]] for instance—although some of them believed it originated in [[Egypt]]. Finally, the concept of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] was actively discussed as a way to classify—and rank—human beings based on difference.

==== E.B. Tylor and James Frazer====
[[File:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|left|Sir E. B. Tylor (1832-1917), nineteenth-century British anthropologist]]
[[File:JamesGeorgeFrazer.jpg|thumb|right|Sir James George Frazer (1854-1941)]]

[[Edward Burnett Tylor]] (2 October 1832&amp;nbsp;– 2 January 1917) and [[James Frazer|James George Frazer]] (1 January 1854&amp;nbsp;– 7 May 1941) are generally considered the antecedents to modern [[social anthropology]] in Britain. Although Tylor undertook a field trip to [[Mexico]], both he and Frazer derived most of the material for their comparative studies through extensive reading, not [[fieldwork]], mainly the Classics (literature and history of Greece and Rome), the work of the early European folklorists, and reports from missionaries, travelers, and contemporaneous ethnologists.

Tylor advocated strongly for unilinealism and a form of "uniformity of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/gad/history/044stocking.pdf Stocking, George Jr. (1963) "Matthew Arnold, E. B. Tylor, and the Uses of Invention", ''American Anthropologist'', 65:783-799, 1963] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202133549/http://www.aaanet.org/gad/history/044stocking.pdf |date=2007-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tylor in particular laid the groundwork for theories of [[cultural diffusionism]], stating that there are three ways that different groups can have similar cultural forms or technologies: "independent invention, inheritance from ancestors in a distant region, transmission from one race {{sic}} to another".&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E. B. (1865) ''Researches into the early history of mankind the development of civilization.'' London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tylor formulated one of the early and influential anthropological conceptions of [[culture]] as "that complex whole, which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by [humans] as [members] of society".&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E. B. (1871) ''Primitive culture: researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, art, and custom''. 2 vols. London, John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Stocking notes, Tylor mainly concerned himself with describing and mapping the distribution of particular elements of culture, rather than with the larger function, and he generally seemed to assume a Victorian idea of progress rather than the idea of non-directional, multilineal cultural development proposed by later anthropologists.

Tylor also theorized about the origins of religious beliefs in human beings, proposing a theory of [[animism]] as the earliest stage, and noting that "religion" has many components, of which he believed the most important to be belief in supernatural beings (as opposed to moral systems, cosmology, etc.). Frazer, a Scottish scholar with a broad knowledge of Classics, also concerned himself with religion, myth, and magic. His comparative studies, most influentially in the numerous editions of ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', analyzed similarities in religious belief and symbolism globally. Neither Tylor nor Frazer, however, was particularly interested in [[fieldwork]], nor were they interested in examining how the cultural elements and institutions fit together. The Golden Bough was abridged drastically in subsequent editions after his first.

==== Bronislaw Malinowski and the British School ====
Toward the turn of the twentieth century, a number of anthropologists became dissatisfied with this categorization of cultural elements; historical reconstructions also came to seem increasingly speculative to them. Under the influence of several younger scholars, a new approach came to predominate among British anthropologists, concerned with analyzing how societies held together in the present ([[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] analysis, rather than [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] or historical analysis), and emphasizing long-term (one to several years) immersion fieldwork. [[Cambridge University]] financed a [[William Rivers#Torres Straits Expedition|multidisciplinary expedition]] to the [[Torres Strait Islands]] in 1898, organized by [[Alfred Cort Haddon]] and including a physician-anthropologist, [[William Rivers]], as well as a linguist, a botanist, and other specialists. The findings of the expedition set new standards for ethnographic description.

A decade and a half later, Polish anthropology student [[Bronisław Malinowski]] (1884–1942) was beginning what he expected to be a brief period of [[fieldwork]] in the old model, collecting lists of cultural items, when the outbreak of the First World War stranded him in [[New Guinea]]. As a subject of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] resident on a British colonial possession, he was effectively confined to New Guinea for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, Bronisław (1967) ''A diary in the strict sense of the term''. New York, Harcourt, Brace &amp; World [1967]&lt;/ref&gt;

He made use of the time by undertaking far more intensive fieldwork than had been done by ''British'' anthropologists, and his classic ethnography, ''[[Argonauts of the Western Pacific]]'' (1922) advocated an approach to [[fieldwork]] that became standard in the field: getting "the native's point of view" through [[participant observation]]. Theoretically, he advocated a [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] interpretation, which examined how social institutions functioned to satisfy individual needs.

British social anthropology had an expansive moment in the [[Interwar period]], with key contributions coming from the Polish-British [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[Meyer Fortes]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (1995) ''[http://www3.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521450489 The Expansive Moment: The Rise of Social Anthropology in Britain and Africa, 1918-1970] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106055917/http://www3.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521450489 |date=2007-11-06 }}'' review at {{jstor|646577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]] also published a seminal work in 1922. He had carried out his initial fieldwork in the [[Andaman Islands]] in the old style of historical reconstruction. However, after reading the work of French sociologists [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Marcel Mauss]], Radcliffe-Brown published an account of his research (entitled simply ''The Andaman Islanders'') that paid close attention to the meaning and purpose of rituals and myths. Over time, he developed an approach known as [[structural functionalism]], which focused on how institutions in societies worked to balance out or create an equilibrium in the social system to keep it functioning harmoniously. (This contrasted with Malinowski's functionalism, and was quite different from the later French [[Structuralism#Structuralism in anthropology and sociology|structuralism]], which examined the conceptual structures in language and symbolism.)

Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown's influence stemmed from the fact that they, like Boas, actively trained students and aggressively built up institutions that furthered their programmatic ambitions. This was particularly the case with Radcliffe-Brown, who spread his agenda for "Social Anthropology" by teaching at universities across the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]. From the late 1930s until the postwar period appeared a string of monographs and edited volumes that cemented the paradigm of British Social Anthropology (BSA). Famous ethnographies include ''The Nuer,'' by [[Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard]], and ''The Dynamics of Clanship Among the Tallensi,'' by [[Meyer Fortes]]; well-known edited volumes include ''African Systems of Kinship and Marriage'' and ''African Political Systems.''

==== Post WW II trends ====
[[Max Gluckman]], together with many of his colleagues at the [[Rhodes-Livingstone Institute]] and students at [[Manchester University]], collectively known as the [[Manchester School (anthropology)|Manchester School]], took BSA in new directions through their introduction of explicitly Marxist-informed theory, their emphasis on conflicts and conflict resolution, and their attention to the ways in which individuals negotiate and make use of the social structural possibilities.

In Britain, anthropology had a great intellectual impact, it "contributed to the erosion of [[Christianity]], the growth of [[cultural relativism]], an awareness of the survival of the primitive in modern life, and the replacement of [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] modes of analysis with [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]], all of which are central to modern culture."&lt;ref name="Heyck1997"&gt;Heyck, Thomas William (1997) at The American Historical Review, Vol. 102, No. 5 (December, 1997), pp. 1486–1488 {{doi|10.2307/2171126}} {{jstor|2171126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the 1960s and 1970s, [[Edmund Leach]] and his students [[Mary Douglas]] and [[Nur Yalman]], among others, introduced French structuralism in the style of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]; while British anthropology has continued to emphasize social organization and economics over purely symbolic or literary topics, differences among British, French, and American sociocultural anthropologies have diminished with increasing dialogue and borrowing of both theory and methods. Today, social anthropology in Britain engages internationally with many other social theories and has branched in many directions.

In countries of the British Commonwealth, social anthropology has often been institutionally separate from [[physical anthropology]] and [[primatology]], which may be connected with departments of biology or zoology; and from archaeology, which may be connected with departments of [[Classics]], [[Egyptology]], and the like. In other countries (and in some, particularly smaller, British and North American universities), anthropologists have also found themselves institutionally linked with scholars of [[folklore]], [[Museology|museum studies]], [[human geography]], [[sociology]], [[social relations]], [[ethnic studies]], [[cultural studies]], and [[social work]].

Anthropology has been used in Britain to provide an alternative explanation for the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010]] to the technical explanations rooted in economic and political theory. Dr. [[Gillian Tett]], a [[Cambridge University]] trained anthropologist who went on to become a senior editor at the [[Financial Times]] is one of the leaders in this use of anthropology.

===Canada===
Canadian anthropology began, as in other parts of the Colonial world, as ethnological data in the records of travellers and missionaries. In Canada, [[Jesuit]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] such as Fathers LeClercq, Le Jeune and Sagard, in the 17th century, provide the oldest ethnographic records of native tribes in what was then the Dominion of Canada. The academic discipline has drawn strongly on both the British Social Anthropology and the American Cultural Anthropology traditions, producing a hybrid "Socio-cultural" anthropology.

==== George Mercer Dawson ====
True anthropology began with a [[Government agency|Government department]]: the [[Geological Survey of Canada]], and [[George Mercer Dawson]] (director in 1895). Dawson's support for anthropology created impetus for the profession in Canada. This was expanded upon by Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, who established a Division of Anthropology within the Geological Survey in 1910.

==== Edward Sapir ====
Anthropologists were recruited from England and the USA, setting the foundation for the unique Canadian style of anthropology. Scholars include the linguist and Boasian [[Edward Sapir]].

===France===
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
Anthropology in France has a less clear genealogy than the British and American traditions, in part because many French writers influential in anthropology have been trained or held faculty positions in sociology, philosophy, or other fields rather than in anthropology.

==== Marcel Mauss ====
Most commentators consider [[Marcel Mauss]] (1872–1950), nephew of the influential sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], to be the founder of the French anthropological tradition. Mauss belonged to Durkheim's ''[[Année Sociologique]]'' group. While Durkheim and others examined the state of modern societies, Mauss and his collaborators (such as [[Henri Hubert]] and [[Robert Hertz]]) drew on ethnography and philology to analyze societies that were not as 'differentiated' as European nation states.

Two works by Mauss in particular proved to have enduring relevance: ''[[The Gift (book)|Essay on the Gift]],'' a seminal analysis of [[trade|exchange]] and [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], and his Huxley lecture on the notion of the person, the first comparative study of notions of person and selfhood cross-culturally.&lt;ref&gt;Mauss, Marcel (1938) "A category of the human mind: the notion of person; the notion of self", in M. Carrithers, S. Collins, and S. Lukes, eds. ''The Category of the Person: anthropology, philosophy, history''. Pp. 1-25. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press. Originally given as "Une categorie de l'Esprit Humain: La Notion de Personne, Celle de 'Moi'", for the Huxley Memorial Lecture and appeared in the ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the interwar years, French interest in anthropology often dovetailed with wider cultural movements such as [[surrealism]] and [[primitivism (art movement)|primitivism]], which drew on ethnography for inspiration. [[Marcel Griaule]] and [[Michel Leiris]] are examples of people who combined anthropology with the French avant-garde. During this time most of what is known as ''ethnologie'' was restricted to museums, such as the [[Musée de l'Homme]] founded by [[Paul Rivet]], and anthropology had a close relationship with studies of [[folklore]].

==== Claude Lévi-Strauss ====
Above all, [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] helped institutionalize anthropology in France. Along with the enormous influence that his theory of [[structuralism]] exerted across multiple disciplines, Lévi-Strauss established ties with American and British anthropologists. At the same time, he established centers and laboratories within France to provide an institutional context within anthropology, while training influential students such as [[Maurice Godelier]] and [[Françoise Héritier]]. They proved influential in the world of French anthropology. Much of the distinct character of France's anthropology today is a result of the fact that most anthropology is carried out in nationally funded research laboratories ([[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]]) rather than academic departments in universities

Other influential writers in the 1970s include [[Pierre Clastres]], who explains in his books on the [[Guayakis|Guayaki]] tribe in [[Paraguay]] that "primitive societies" actively oppose the institution of the [[state (polity)|state]]. These stateless societies are not less evolved than societies with states, but chose to conjure the institution of [[authority]] as a separate function from society. The [[Leadership|leader]] is only a spokesperson for the group when it has to deal with other groups ("international relations") but has no inside authority, and may be violently removed if he attempts to abuse this position.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew Dean "Critical Re-vision: Clastres' Chronicle and the optic of [[primitivism]]", 2002 In ''Best of Anthropology Today, 1974–2000'', ed. J. Benthall, with a preface by M. Sahlins. London: Routledge. [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0415262550 Amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important French social theorist since [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and Lévi-Strauss is [[Pierre Bourdieu]], who trained formally in philosophy and sociology and eventually held the Chair of Sociology at the Collège de France. Like Mauss and others before him, he worked on topics both in sociology and anthropology. His fieldwork among the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] of Algeria places him solidly in anthropology, while his analysis of the function and reproduction of fashion and cultural capital in European societies places him as solidly in sociology.

===United States===
From its beginnings in the early 19th century through the early 20th century, anthropology in the United States was influenced by the presence of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] societies. [[File:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Franz Boas]], one of the pioneers of modern anthropology, often called the "Father of American Anthropology"]]
[[Cultural anthropology]] in the United States was influenced greatly by the ready availability of Native American societies as ethnographic subjects. The field was pioneered by staff of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and the Smithsonian Institution's [[Bureau of American Ethnology]], men such as [[John Wesley Powell]] and [[Frank Hamilton Cushing]].

Late-eighteenth-century ethnology established the scientific foundation for the field, which began to mature in the United States during the presidency of [[Andrew Jackson]] (1829–1837). Jackson was responsible for implementing the Indian Removal Act, the coerced and forced removal of an estimated 100,000 American Indians during the 1830s to Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma; for insuring that the franchise was extended to all white men, irrespective of financial means while denying virtually all black men the right to vote; and, for suppressing abolitionists' efforts to end slavery while vigorously defending that institution. Finally, he was responsible for appointing Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] who would decide, in Scott v. Sandford (1857), that Negroes were "beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race&amp;nbsp;... and so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect". As a result of this decision, black people, whether free or enslaved, could never become citizens of the United States.

It was in this context that the so-called American School of Anthropology thrived as the champion of polygenism or the doctrine of multiple origins—sparking a debate between those influenced by the Bible who believed in the unity of humanity and those who argued from a scientific standpoint for the plurality of origins and the antiquity of distinct types. Like the monogenists, these theories were not monolithic and often used words like races, species, hybrid, and mongrel interchangeably. A scientific consensus began to emerge during this period "that there exists a Genus Homo, embracing many primordial types of 'species'". [[Charles Caldwell (physician)|Charles Caldwell]], [[Samuel George Morton]], [[Samuel A. Cartwright]], [[George Gliddon]], [[Josiah C. Nott]], and [[Louis Agassiz]], and even South Carolina Governor [[James Henry Hammond]] were all influential proponents of this school. While some were disinterested scientists, others were passionate advocates who used science to promote slavery in a period of increasing sectional strife. All were complicit in establishing the putative science that justified slavery, informed the Dred Scott decision, underpinned miscegenation laws, and eventually fueled Jim Crow. Samuel G. Morton, for example, claimed to be just a scientist but he did not hesitate to provide evidence of Negro inferiority to John C. Calhoun, the prominent pro-slavery Secretary of State to help him negotiate the annexation of Texas as a slave state.

The high-water mark of polygenic theories was Josiah Nott and Gliddon's voluminous eight-hundred page tome titled ''Types of Mankind'', published in 1854. Reproducing the work of Louis Agassiz and Samuel Morton, the authors spread the virulent and explicitly racist views to a wider, more popular audience. The first printing sold out quickly and by the end of the century it had undergone nine editions. Although many Southerners felt that all the justification for slavery they needed was found in the Bible, others used the new science to defend slavery and the repression of American Indians. Abolitionists, however, felt they had to take this science on its own terms. And for the first time, African American intellectuals waded into the contentious debate. In the immediate wake of Types of Mankind and during the pitched political battles that led to Civil War, [[Frederick Douglass]] (1818–1895), the statesman and persuasive abolitionist, directly attacked the leading theorists of the American School of Anthropology. In an 1854 address, entitled "The Claims of the Negro Ethnologically Considered", Douglass argued that "by making the enslaved a character fit only for slavery, [slaveowners] excuse themselves for refusing to make the slave a freeman.... For let it be once granted that the human race are of multitudinous origin, naturally different in their moral, physical, and intellectual capacities&amp;nbsp;... a chance is left for slavery, as a necessary institution.... There is no doubt that Messrs. Nott, Glidden, Morton, Smith and Agassiz were duly consulted by our slavery propagating statesmen" (p.&amp;nbsp;287).

==== Lewis Henry Morgan in the United States====
[[Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1818–1881), a lawyer from [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]], became an advocate for and ethnological scholar of the [[Iroquois]]. His comparative analyses of religion, government, material culture, and especially kinship patterns proved to be influential contributions to the field of anthropology. Like other scholars of his day (such as [[Edward Tylor]]), Morgan argued that human societies could be classified into categories of cultural evolution on a scale of progression that ranged from ''savagery'', to ''barbarism'', to ''civilization''. He focused on understanding how cultures integrated and systematized, and how the various features of one culture indicate an evolutionary status in comparison with other cultures. Generally, Morgan used technology (such as bowmaking or pottery) as an indicator of position on this scale.

==== Franz Boas ====
[[Franz Boas]] established academic anthropology in the United States in opposition to this sort of evolutionary perspective. His approach was empirical, skeptical of overgeneralizations, and eschewed attempts to establish universal laws. For example, Boas studied immigrant children to demonstrate that biological race was not immutable, and that human conduct and behavior resulted from nurture, rather than nature.

Influenced by the German tradition, Boas argued that the world was full of distinct ''cultures,'' rather than societies whose evolution could be measured by how much or how little "civilization" they had. He believed that each culture has to be studied in its particularity, and argued that cross-cultural generalizations, like those made in the [[natural science]]s, were not possible.

In doing so, he fought discrimination against immigrants, blacks, and indigenous peoples of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. (1968) ''Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology''. London: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many American anthropologists adopted his agenda for social reform, and theories of race continue to be popular subjects for anthropologists today. The so-called "Four Field Approach" has its origins in Boasian Anthropology, dividing the discipline in the four crucial and interrelated fields of sociocultural, biological, linguistic, and archaic anthropology (e.g. archaeology). Anthropology in the United States continues to be deeply influenced by the Boasian tradition, especially its emphasis on culture.
[[File:Ruth Benedict.jpg|thumb|[[Ruth Benedict]] in 1937]]

Boas used his positions at [[Columbia University]] and the [[American Museum of Natural History]] to train and develop multiple generations of students. His first generation of students included [[Alfred Kroeber]], [[Robert Lowie]], [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ruth Benedict]], who each produced richly detailed studies of indigenous North American cultures. They provided a wealth of details used to attack the theory of a single evolutionary process. Kroeber and Sapir's focus on Native American languages helped establish [[linguistics]] as a truly general science and free it from its historical focus on [[Indo-European languages]].

The publication of [[Alfred Kroeber]]'s textbook, ''Anthropology,'' marked a turning point in American anthropology. After three decades of amassing material, Boasians felt a growing urge to generalize. This was most obvious in the 'Culture and Personality' studies carried out by younger Boasians such as [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Ruth Benedict]]. Influenced by psychoanalytic psychologists including [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]], these authors sought to understand the way that individual personalities were shaped by the wider cultural and social forces in which they grew up.

Though such works as ''[[Coming of Age in Samoa]]'' and ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'' remain popular with the American public, Mead and Benedict never had the impact on the discipline of anthropology that some expected. Boas had planned for Ruth Benedict to succeed him as chair of Columbia's anthropology department, but she was sidelined by [[Ralph Linton]], and Mead was limited to her offices at the [[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]].

===Other countries===
Anthropology as it emerged amongst the Western colonial powers (mentioned above) has generally taken a different path than that in the countries of southern and central Europe ([[Italy]], [[Greece]], and the successors to the [[Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Ottoman empire]]s). In the former, the encounter with multiple, distinct cultures, often very different in organization and language from those of Europe, has led to a continuing emphasis on [[cross-cultural comparison]] and a receptiveness to certain kinds of cultural relativism.&lt;ref name="Spiro1987"&gt;On varieties of cultural relativism in anthropology, see Spiro, Melford E. (1987) "Some Reflections on Cultural Determinism and Relativism with Special Reference to Emotion and Reason", in ''Culture and Human Nature: theoretical papers of Melford E. Spiro''. Edited by B. Kilborne and L. L. Langness, pp. 32–58. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the successor states of continental Europe, on the other hand, anthropologists often joined with folklorists and linguists in building cultural perspectives on nationalism. Ethnologists in these countries tended to focus on differentiating among local ethnolinguistic groups, documenting local folk culture, and representing the prehistory of what has become a nation through various forms of public education (e.g., museums of several kinds).&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest. (1998) ''Language and solitude: Wittgenstein, Malinowski, and the Habsburg dilemma''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this scheme, Russia occupied a middle position. On the one hand, it had a large region (largely east of the Urals) of highly distinct, pre-industrial, often non-literate peoples, similar to the situation in the Americas. On the other hand, Russia also participated to some degree in the nationalist (cultural and political) movements of Central and Eastern Europe. After the Revolution of 1917, views expressed by anthropologists in the USSR, and later the Soviet Bloc countries, were highly shaped by the requirement to conform to Marxist theories of social evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest, ed. (1980) ''Soviet and Western anthropology''. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greece, there was since the 19th century a science of the [[folklore]] called ''laographia'' (laography), in the form of "a science of the interior", although theoretically weak; but the connotation of the field deeply changed after World War II, when a wave of Anglo-American anthropologists introduced a science "of the outside".&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Zoïa, "L'anthropologie en Grèce", Terrain, Numéro 14—L'incroyable et ses preuves (mars 1990), [En ligne], mis en ligne le 7 octobre 2005, [http://terrain.revues.org/document3641.html Terrain.revues.org], Consulté le 15 juin 2007. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of [[World Anthropologies|world anthropologies]] has followed different trajectories.

==20th-century developments==
In the mid-20th century, American anthropology began to study its own history more systematically. In 1967 [[Marvin Harris]] published his ''The Rise of Anthropological Theory'', presenting argumentative examinations of anthropology's historical developments, and [[George W. Stocking, Jr.]], established the historicist school, examining the historical contexts of anthropological movements.

[[File:Good housekeeping 1908 08 a.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Good Housekeeping]]'' is one of several [[periodical]]s related to homemaking]]
[[File:Title page of OUR HOME CYCLOPEDIA, printed 1889.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of ''Our Home Cyclopedia: Cookery and Housekeeping,'' published in Detroit, Michigan, in 1889]]
'''Homemaking''' is a mainly [[American English|American]] term for the management of a [[home]], otherwise known as '''housework''', '''[[housekeeping]]''', or '''household management'''.  It is the act of overseeing the organizational, day-to-day operations of a house or estate, and the managing of other domestic concerns. 
A person in charge of the homemaking, who is not employed outside the home, is in the U.S. called a '''homemaker''', a  term for a [[housewife]] or a [[househusband]]. The term "homemaker", however, may also refer to a [[social worker]] who manages a household during the incapacity of the housewife or househusband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/homemaker |title=homemaker - definition of homemaker by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Housework is not always a lifetime commitment; many, for economic or personal reasons, return to the workplace. In previous decades, there were many mandatory courses for the young to learn the skills of homemaking.  In high school, courses included [[cooking]], [[nutrition]], [[home economics]], [[family and consumer science]] (FACS), and [[food and cooking hygiene]]. This last one may underlie the tradition that a homemaker is portrayed wearing an [[apron]]. More recently, most of these courses have been abolished, and many youths in high school and college would be more likely to study child development and the management of children's behavior.

==Household tools==
{{main|Domestic technology|:Category:Home appliances|:Category:Cleaning tools}}
The method and function of housework are different in the industrial world and in other countries, with the balance of convenience, labor-saving devices and easier methods being in the industrial homemaker's favor. The reason for this is that mechanical [[invention]] has been applied extensively to different tasks of the home. Inventors have developed mechanical labor-saving devices not only for the shop and office, but also for the home. There are, on the market, thousands of household tools, devices and equipment for every domestic need. It only remains for the homemaker to choose between them.

Another reason for the great supply and demand for household labor savers in the industrial world is that the homemaker has to face the increasingly complex problem of scarce [[domestic help]]. With cheap labor, the need for the mechanical replacers of labor, or "mechanical servants," will not be keenly felt, however, the majority of homemakers perform their own household tasks. It is to this class of homemakers who are actively concerned in domestic work that the labor-saver and improved modern [[tool]] most appeal. The homemaker's time and effort are worth conserving by every means. Homemakers should, therefore, be eager to buy and use all the household tools that will save their strength and time and liberate them from household drudgery.

While some homemakers are "handy" with tools, the fact remains that most homemakers are unfamiliar with the different principles involved in mechanical tools and devices. The homemaker, however, is called to have knowledge of the principles of applied mechanics. Courses in school physics unfortunately leave a student with little practical knowledge that can be applied to domestic equipment. The gaining of knowledge concerning domestic tools may lead the homemaker to purchase good quality equipment, which may assist in saving time and labor.

==Housekeeping==
[[File:dyson.cleaner.dc07.arp.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[vacuum cleaner]]]]
[[Housekeeping]] by the homemaker is the care and control of property, ensuring its maintenance and proper use and appearance. A [[home]] is a place of residence.&lt;ref name="defhome"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/home |title='Home' - Definitions from Dictionary.com|publisher=[[Dictionary.com]] |accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a private home a [[maid]] or [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] might be employed to do some of the housekeeping. Housework is work done by the act of housekeeping. Some housekeeping is housecleaning and some housekeeping is home chores. Home chores are housework that needs to be done at regular intervals,&lt;ref&gt;Gove, Philip et al. 1961. ''Webster’s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language'' Unabridged. Springfield, Massachusetts: G &amp; C Merriam Company&lt;/ref&gt; Housekeeping includes the budget and control of expenditures, preparing meals and buying food, paying the heat bill, and cleaning the house.&lt;ref&gt;Ansley, Clark et al. 1935. ''The Columbia Encyclopedia in One Volume''. Morningside Heights, NY: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooking===
{{main|Cooking}}
{{See also|List of food preparation utensils|Diet (nutrition)|Cuisine|Cookbook}}
Most modern-day houses contain [[Sanitation|sanitary facilities]] and a means of [[Cooking|preparing food]]. A [[kitchen]] is a room or part of a room used by the Homemaker for [[cooking]], [[food preparation]] and food preservation. In the West, a modern kitchen is typically equipped with a [[stove]], an oven, a [[sink]] with hot and cold running water, a [[refrigerator]] and [[kitchen cabinet]]s. Many homemakers use a [[microwave oven]], a [[dishwasher]] and other electric appliances like [[blender]] and convection [[cooker]] and automatic appliances like [[rotimatic]] and automatic cookers. The main function of a kitchen is cooking or preparing food but it may also be used for [[dining]] and [[entertaining]].

[[Cooking]] is the process of preparing [[food]] with or without [[heat]], making and selecting, measuring and combining ingredients in an ordered procedure for producing safe and edible food. The process encompasses a vast range of methods, tools and combinations of [[ingredient]]s to alter the [[flavor]], appearance, texture, or [[digestion|digestibility]] of food. Factors affecting the final outcome include the variability of ingredients, ambient conditions, [[tool]]s, and the skill of the individual doing the actual cooking.

The diversity of cooking worldwide is a reflection of the aesthetic, agricultural, economic, cultural, social and religious diversity throughout the nations, races, creeds and tribes across the globe. Applying heat to a food usually, though not always, [[chemistry|chemically]] transforms it, thus changing its flavor, texture, consistency, appearance, and nutritional properties. Methods of cooking that involve the boiling of [[liquid]] in a receptacle have been practised at least since the 10th millennium BC, with the introduction of [[pottery]].

===Cleaning===
[[Housecleaning]] by the homemaker is the systematic process of making a home neat and clean. This may be applied more broadly that just an individual home, or as a metaphor for a similar "clean up" process applied elsewhere such as a procedural reform. In the process of housecleaning general cleaning activities are completed, such as disposing of [[rubbish]], storing of belongings in regular places, cleaning dirty surfaces, [[dust]]ing and [[Vacuum cleaner|vacuuming]]. The details of this are various and complicated enough that many books have been published on the subject. How-to sites on the internet have many articles on housecleaning. Tools include the [[vacuum cleaner]], [[broom]] and [[mop]]. Supplies such as [[Detergent|cleaning solutions]] and sponges are sold in grocery stores and elsewhere. Professional cleaners can be hired for less frequent or specialist tasks such as cleaning blinds, rugs, and sofas. Professional services are also offered for the basic tasks. Safety is a consideration because some cleaning products are [[toxic]] and some cleaning tasks are physically demanding. ''[[Green cleaning]]'' refers to cleaning without causing pollution. The history of housecleaning has links to the advancement of technology.

Outdoor housecleaning chores include removing leaves from rain gutters, washing windows, sweeping doormats, cleaning the pool, putting away lawn furniture, and taking out the trash.&lt;ref&gt;Smallin, Donna. 2006. ''Cleaning Plain &amp; Simple''. Storey Publishing, North Adams, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laundry===
{{see also|Ironing}}
[[File:Waschvollautomat Constructa 1950er.jpg|thumb|left|A 1950s [[washing machine]]]]

[[Laundry]] refers to the act of [[washing]] [[clothing]] and [[linen]]s, the place where that washing is done, and/or that which needs to be, is being, or has been laundered. Various chemicals may be used to increase the solvent power of water, such as the compounds in [[soaproot]] or yucca-root used by Native American tribes. [[Soap]], a compound made from [[lye]] (from wood-ash) and [[fat]], is an ancient and very common laundry aid. Modern [[washing machine]]s typically use powdered or liquid [[laundry detergent]] in place of more traditional soap. Once clean, the clothes have been wrung out — twisted to remove most of the water. Then they were hung up on poles or clotheslines to air dry, or sometimes just spread out on clean grass.

Washing machines and dryers are now fixtures in homes around the world. In some parts of the world, including the USA, Canada, and Switzerland, [[apartment building]]s and [[dormitory|dormitories]] often have laundry rooms, where residents share washing machines and dryers. Usually the machines are set to run only when money is put in a [[Currency detector|coin slot]]. In other parts of the world, apartment buildings with laundry rooms are uncommon, and each apartment may have its own washing machine. Those without a machine at home or the use of a laundry room must either wash their clothes by hand or visit a commercial [[laundromat]].

A [[clothes dryer]] is a household appliance that is used to remove moisture from a load of [[clothing]] and other [[textiles]], generally shortly after they are cleaned in a washing machine. Most dryers consist of a rotating [[drum]] called a tumbler through which heated air is circulated to [[evaporate]] the moisture from the load. The tumbler is rotated relatively slowly in order to maintain space between the articles in the load. In most cases, the tumbler is belt-driven by an [[induction motor]]. Using these machines may cause clothes to shrink, become less soft (due to loss of short soft fibers/ lint) and fade. For these reasons, as well as environmental concerns, many people use open air methods such as a [[clothes line]] and [[clotheshorse]].

[[starch|Laundry starch]] is used in the [[laundry|laundering]] of [[clothing|clothes]]. Starch was widely used in [[Europe]] in the 16th and 17th centuries to stiffen the wide collars and [[Ruff (clothing)|ruffs]] of fine linen which surrounded the necks of the well-to-do. During the 19th century and early 20th century, it was stylish to stiffen the collars and sleeves of men's [[shirt]]s and the ruffles of girls' [[petticoat]]s by applying starch to them as the clean clothes were being [[ironing|ironed]]. Aside from the smooth, crisp edges it gave to clothing, it served practical purposes as well. [[dust|Dirt]] and [[sweat]] from a person's neck and wrists would stick to the starch rather than to the fibers of the clothing, and would easily wash away along with the starch. After each laundering, the starch would be reapplied. Today the product is sold in [[Aerosol spray|aerosol cans]] for home use.

==Maintenance==
{{main|Maintenance, repair and operations}}
Homemakers that follow [[predictive maintenance]] techniques determine the condition of in-service equipment in order to predict when maintenance should be performed. This approach offers cost savings over routine or time-based maintenance, because tasks are performed only when warranted. Homemakers that follow [[preventive maintenance]] methods ensure that household equipment and the house are in satisfactory operating condition by providing for inspection, detection, and correction of incipient failures either before they occur or before they develop into major defects.

===Home maintenance===
{{main|Home repair|Home improvement|Home automation| Handyman}}
[[Home maintenance]] involves the diagnosis and resolution of problems in a home, and is related to home maintenance to avoid such problems. Many types of maintenance are "[[Do it yourself]]" (DIY) projects. Maintenance is not necessarily the same as [[home improvement]], although many improvements can result from repairs or maintenance. Often the costs of larger repairs will justify the alternative of investment in full-scale improvements. It may make just as much sense to upgrade a home system (with an improved one) as to repair it or incur ever-more-frequent and expensive maintenance for an inefficient, obsolete or dying system. For a DIY project, also useful is the established limits on  time and money investments before a repair (or list of repairs) become overwhelming and discouraging, and less likely to ever be completed.

===Lawn maintenance===
{{main|Lawn care | Gardening}}
Homemakers that have a lawn responsibility adhere to seasonal [[lawn care]] practices, which vary to some extent depending on the [[climate zone]] and type of [[grass]] that is grown (whether cool season or warm season varieties). Various recognized method used by homemakers in lawn care are observed in any area. In spring or early summer, homemakers seed, sod, or sprig a yard when the ground is warmer. In Summer lawn mowers are used at high cutting for cool season grass, and lower cutting for warm season lawns. In autumn, lawns are mown by homemakers at a lower height and thatch build-up that occurs in warm season grasses are removed.&lt;ref&gt;Lawn experts are divided in their opinions on this.&lt;/ref&gt; Homemakers do add sandy [[loam]] and apply fertilizer, containing some type of wetting agent. Cool season lawns are planted in the autumn with adequate rainfall. Lawn care in the winter is minimal, requiring only light feedings of organic material, such as green-waste compost, and minerals to encourage earthworms and beneficial microbes.

==Management==
Household management by the homemaker is the act of overseeing the [[organizing (management)|organizational]], financial, and day-to-day operations of a house or estate. It differs from [[housekeeping]], which consists of the physical maintenance and cleaning of a house.

Also common in the U.S are homemaking parties which involve a group of people doing household work instead of hanging out with their friends.

===House organization===
House organization or home organization includes interior design which is making the home aesthetically pleasing; and de-cluttering which is removing unnecessary things from the house.

====Interior design====
Interior design is making the home aesthetically pleasing. Its activities include arranging furniture,  having plants inside the house, and more.

====De-cluttering====
Household de-cluttering involves putting things in their proper place after they have been used.  "Cleaning up your mess" might involve removing glasses or eating utensils from the living room if you have eaten a meal there in front of the television.  If several people have done that over a few days and not removed their glasses, dishes and utensils from the living room, the living room is considered to be "cluttered" with dishes.  The dishes are out of place because they belong in the kitchen, washed and put away in the cupboards. That is the most common example of clutter in a modern American household.

There is another definition of clutter, which refers to having simply too many things and not enough room for all of it.  Sometimes as happens in Asian households, the items are necessary, but the house is simply too small, and ingenious methods are needed to organize everything so that unsightly clutter does not result.  However, removing unneeded or no longer necessary objects from a household or home is also an aspect of de-cluttering. Objects can be [[Gift|given away]] to friends or [[Charitable organization|charitable]] organizations, [[selling|sold]] as [[second-hand]], [[Recycling|recycled]] or [[Waste management|thrown away]].

Extreme forms of an inability to de-clutter is a behavioral aspect of [[compulsive hoarding]]. On the other end, a society that relies overly much on generating and then disposing of [[waste]] is referred to as [[throw-away society]].

===Household purchasing===
{{Main|Purchasing | Household budget | Shopping}}
Household [[purchasing]] refers to homemaker's attempt to acquire goods or services to accomplish the goals of the household. Though there are several households that attempt to set standards in the purchasing process, processes can vary greatly between households. Typically the word “purchasing” is not used interchangeably with the word “[[procurement]]”, since procurement typically includes other concepts. Home makers decide the market goods that the household will buy, such as the [[groceries]] which have been bought at a [[grocer]]'s.

Another important purchase handled by homemakers is the power source used for appliances. Home or other building heating may include boilers, [[furnace]]s, and [[water heater]]s. [[Compressed natural gas]] is used in [[rural]] homes without connections to [[plumbing|piped]]-in [[public utility]] services, or with portable [[Grill (cooking)|grills]]. However, due to being less economical than [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], LPG (Propane) is the dominant source of rural gas for natural gas-powered ranges and/or ovens, natural gas-heated [[clothes dryer]]s, [[HVAC|heating]]/[[air conditioning|cooling]] and [[central heating]]. The amount of usages is determined by factors such as [[natural gas prices]].

===Servants===
{{main|Maid|Butler|Domestic worker}}
Homemakers may manage household workers or "[[domestic worker]]s".

==Work strategies==
{{main|Household|Employment}}
In [[sociology]], ''household work strategy'' is the [[division of labour]] between members of a household, whether implicit or the result of explicit decision–making, with the alternatives weighed up in a simplified type of [[cost-benefit analysis]].&lt;ref name="essex-pahl"&gt;[http://www.essex.ac.uk/Sociology/people/staff/pahl.shtm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204011627/http://www.essex.ac.uk/Sociology/people/staff/pahl.shtm |date=December 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DivisionsLabour"&gt;''Divisions of Labour'' Ray Pahl (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a plan for the relative deployment of household members' time between the three domains of [[employment]]:
# in the ''[[market economy]]'', including home-based self-employment second jobs, in order to obtain money to buy goods and services in the market;
# ''domestic production work'', such as cultivating a vegetable patch or raising chickens, purely to supply food to the household; and
# ''domestic consumption work'' to provide goods and services directly within the household, such as cooking meals, child–care, household repairs, or the manufacture of clothes and gifts.
Household work strategies may vary over the life-cycle, as household members age, or with the economic environment; they may be imposed by one person or be decided collectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-householdworkstrategy.html|title=Household work strategy|publisher=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Household production==
Homemaking is described by economists as "household production".   Household production has been defined as "the production of the goods and services by the members of a household, for their own consumption, using their own capital and their own [[unpaid work |unpaid labor]]. Goods and services produced by households for their own use include accommodation, meals, clean clothes, and child care. The process of household production involves the transformation of purchased intermediate commodities into final consumption commodities. Households use their own capital and their own labor."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ironmonger, D. |url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/mlb/wpaper/759.html |title=Household Production and the Household Economy |publisher=Ideas.repec.org |date=2000-02-02 |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goods and services created at the household level are generally consumed within the country within which they were produced, and hence contribute to "Domestic Consumption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/business-english/domestic-consumption|title=Domestic Consumption|publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wages for housework==
The [[Wages for housework|International Wages for Housework Campaign]] was a global, social movement co-founded in 1972 in [[Padua]], Italy, by author and activist [[Selma James]]. The Campaign was formed to raise awareness of how housework and [[childcare]] are the base of all industrial work and to stake the claim that these unavoidable tasks should be compensated as paid, wage labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=James|first=Selma|title=Is Transformation Possible? They Say We Can't. We Must.|jstor=20838923|work=Off Our Backs|publisher=Off Our Backs. Inc|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demands for the Wages for Housework formally called for economic compensation for domestic work but also used these demands to more generally call attention to the affective labors of women, the reliance of capitalist economies on exploitative labor practices against women, and leisure inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nplusonemag.com/more-smiles-more-money|title=More Smiles? More Money|work=nplusonemag.com|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[List of home appliances|Many home appliances]] have been invented that make housework faster or more effective compared to before the industrial revolution.  These include:
* [[Washing machine]]
* [[Clothes dryer]]
* [[Dishwasher]]
* [[Sewing machine]]
* [[Vacuum cleaner]]
* [[Small electrics]] like the [[electric mixer]], [[blender]], [[toaster]], and [[coffee maker]]
* [[Microwave oven]]
* [[Refrigerator]], reducing the number of grocery trips or the amount of food preservation work to do

[[Utilities]] can potentially eliminate work like gathering and chopping firewood, shovelling coal, fetching water from outdoors, and heating cold tap water.

Historian Ruth Schwartz Cowan claims that homemakers in the 1800s performed about 50–60 hours of work per week, and that this is the same as the 1990s.  She says that labor-saving devices have been used to make the same amount of time do more work, such as by vacuuming a rug instead of sweeping it, or washing fabrics more frequently.  Modern parents also more frequently transport their children after-school activities, and doctors no longer make house calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines//epi1088.htm |title=No. 1088: Housework |website=Uh.edu |date=2004-08-01 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the discovery of [[ionizing radiation]], a number of '''human radiation experiments''' have been performed to understand the effects of ionizing radiation and [[radioactive contamination]] on the human body, specifically with the element [[plutonium]].

==Experiments performed in the United States==

{{see also|Unethical human experimentation in the United States#Human radiation experiments}}

Numerous human radiation experiments have been performed in the United States, many of which were funded by various U.S. government agencies&lt;ref&gt;U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Energy Conservation and Power. American Nuclear Guinea Pigs: Three Decades of Radiation Experiments on US. Citizens. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[United States Department of Defense]], the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]], and the [[United States Public Health Service]]. Experiments including:
 
* feeding radioactive material to mentally disabled children&lt;ref name=pluto&gt;[[The Plutonium Files]]: America's secret medical experiments in the Cold War, by Eileen Welsome, Dial Press, c1999, New York, N.Y., {{ISBN|0-385-31402-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* enlisting doctors to administer radioactive iron to impoverished pregnant women
* exposing U.S. soldiers and prisoners to high levels of radiation&lt;ref name=pluto /&gt;
* irradiating the [[testicles]] of prisoners, which caused severe [[birth defects]]&lt;ref name=pluto /&gt;
* exhuming bodies from graveyards to test them for radiation (without the consent of the families of the deceased)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/scotorgrev/Documents/Project%20Sunshine%20%20slippery%20slope.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 15, 1994, President [[Bill Clinton]] formed the [[Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments]] (ACHRE), chaired by Ruth Faden, Ph.D., MPH&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bioethicsinstitute.org/mshome/?id=64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171031102538/http://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/radiation/ ACHRE homepage, archived]&lt;/ref&gt; of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics. One of the primary motivating factors behind his decision to create ACHRE was action taken by his newly appointed Secretary of Energy, Hazel O’Leary, J.D. One of her first actions on taking the reins of the Department of Energy was to announce a new openness policy for the Department. The policy led almost immediately to the release of over 1.6 million pages of classified records. The records made clear that since the 1940s the Atomic Energy Commission had been sponsoring tests on the effects of radiation on the human body. American citizens who had checked into hospitals for a variety of ailments were secretly injected with varying amounts of plutonium and other radioactive materials without their knowledge.  [[Ebb Cade]] was an unwilling participant in medical experiments that involved injection of 4.7 micrograms of [[Plutonium]] on 10 April 1945 at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;Moss, William, and Roger Eckhardt. (1995). "The human plutonium injection experiments." [[Los Alamos Science]]. 23: 177-233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Openness, DOE. (June 1998). Human Radiation Experiments: ACHRE Report. Chapter 5: The Manhattan district Experiments; the first injection. Washington, DC. Superintendent of Documents US Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment was under the supervision of [[Harold Hodge]].&lt;ref&gt;AEC no. UR-38, 1948 Quarterly Technical Report&lt;/ref&gt; Most patients thought it was "just another injection," but the secret studies left enough radioactive material in many of the patients' bodies to induce life-threatening conditions.  Such experiments were not limited to hospital patients, but included other populations such as those set out above, e.g., orphans fed irradiated milk, children injected with radioactive materials, prisoners in Washington and Oregon state prisons. Much of the experimentation was carried out in order to assess how the human body metabolizes radioactive materials, information that could be used by the Departments of Energy and Defense in [[Cold War]] defense/attack planning.

ACHRE's final report was also a factor in the Department of Energy establishing an Office of Human Radiation Experiments (OHRE) that assured publication of DOE’s involvement (by way of its predecessor, the AEC) in Cold War radiation research and experimentation on human subjects. The final report issued by the ACHRE can be found at the Department of Energy's website.

==Soviet Union==

The [[Soviet nuclear program]] involved human experiments on a large scale, including most notably the [[Totskoye nuclear exercise]] of 1954 and the experiments conducted at the [[Semipalatinsk Test Site]] (1949-1989). As of 1950, there were around 700,000 participants at different levels of the program, half of whom were [[Gulag]] prisoners used for radioactivity experiments, as well as the excavation of radioactive ores. Information about the scale, conditions and lethality of those involved in the program is still kept secret by the Russian government and the [[Rosatom (Federal Agency)|Rosatom]] agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Живущие в стеклянном доме|url = http://www.svoboda.org/content/article/27214509.html|newspaper = Радио Свобода|access-date = 2015-08-31|language = Russian|first = Юрий|last = Федоров}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Slow Death In Kazakhstan's Land Of Nuclear Tests|url = http://www.rferl.org/content/soviet_nuclear_testing_semipalatinsk_20th_anniversary/24311518.html|newspaper = RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|date = 2011-08-29|access-date = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other countries ==
In the [[Marshall Islands]], indigenous residents and crewmembers of the fishing boat ''[[Lucky Dragon No. 5]]'' were exposed to the high yields of radioactive testing during the [[Castle Bravo|Castle Bravo explosions]] conducted at [[Bikini Atoll]]. Researchers subsequently exploited this ostensibly unexpected turn of events by conducting research on the onset of effects from [[radiation poisoning]] as part of [[Project 4.1]], raising ethical questions as to both the specific incident and the broader phenomenon of testing in populated areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skoog|first=Kim|title=U.S. NUCLEAR TESTING ON THE MARSHALL ISLANDS: 1946 TO 1958|url=http://www.uvu.edu/ethics/seac/US%20Nuclear%20Testing%20on%20the%20Marshal%20Islands.pdf|publisher=University of Guam|accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the Venezuelan geneticist [[Marcel Roche]] was implicated in Patrick Tierney's 2000 publication, ''[[Darkness in El Dorado]]'', for allegedly administering [[radioactive iodine]] to indigenous peoples in the [[Orinoco|Orinoco basin]] of [[Venezuela]], such as the [[Yanomami]] and [[Makiritare|Ye'Kwana]] peoples, in cooperation with the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)]], possibly with no apparent benefit for the test group and without obtaining proper informed consent. This corresponded to similar administrations of [[iodine-124]] by the French anthropologist Jacques Lizot in cooperation with the [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives|French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA)]].&lt;ref&gt;http://anthroniche.com/darkness_documents/0352.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://anthroniche.com/darkness_documents/0470.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Problems of Chemical Physics''' (IPCP)&lt;ref name=site&gt;See the web site [http://www.icp.ac.ru/eng/ '''Institute of Problems of Chemical Physics''' RAS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328002007/http://www.icp.ac.ru/eng/ |date=2007-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ru|Институт проблем химической физики РАН}}) of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] (RAS) is the largest Institute of the research center in [[Chernogolovka]]. The Institute consists of 10 scientific departments and about 100 laboratories each one held by an independent research groups. The staff of the Institute counts nearly 1500 people, among them more than 100 Professors and 350 PhD.

== History ==
IPCP was established in 1956 as branch of the Moscow [[Institute of Chemical Physics]] RAS. It was reorganized as an independent Institute of Chemical Physics of RAS in [[Chernogolovka]] (1991-1997) and as Institute of Problems of Chemical Physics (since 1997).

The Institute is the basis of a Branch of the [[Moscow State University]], a chair of [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]] and other high schools. Many students of different high schools of the former USSR and Russia were professionally trained in the IPCP RAS: more than a thousand PhD and SciD thesises were defended here. Specialists trained at the Institute work in the RAS organisations and collaborate with numerous foreign Universities and Institutes.

==Research activity==
IPCP carry out investigations in the following fields: general problems of [[chemical physics]], structure of molecules and solids, kinetics and mechanisms of complex chemical reactions, chemical physics of explosion and combustion, chemical physics of polymer synthesis and modification, chemical physics of biological processes and systems, chemical materials science.

In IPCP RAS, a unique experimental base, a testing area and specialized premises allowing large-scale investigations of rapid processes, combustion and explosion, nature chemical-technological and micro-biological installations, vivarium and a modern computer center have been created.

'''Kinetic architecture''' is a concept through which buildings are designed to allow parts of the structure to move, without reducing overall structural integrity. 

A building's capability for motion can be used just to: enhance its aesthetic qualities; respond to environmental conditions; and/or, perform functions that would be impossible for a static structure.

The possibilities for practical implementations of kinetic architecture increased sharply in the late-20th century due to advances in mechanics, electronics, and robotics.

==History==
[[File:Drawbridge.gif|thumb|right|240px|An early instance of kinetic architecture – the ''drawbridge'']]
Rudimentary forms of kinetic architecture such as the [[drawbridge]] can be traced back to the Middle Ages or earlier. Yet it was only in the early 20th century that architects began to widely discuss the possibility for movement to be enabled for a significant portion of a buildings' [[superstructure]]. In the first third of the 20th century, interest in kinetic architect was one of the stands of thought emerging from the [[Futurism]] movement. Various papers and books included plans and drawings for moving buildings, a notable example being [[Yakov Chernikhov|Chernikhov's]] ''101 Architectural Fantasies'' (1933). For the first few decades of the 20th century kinetic architecture was almost entirely theoretical, but by the 1940s innovators such as [[Buckminster Fuller]] began experimenting with concrete implementations, though his early efforts in this direction are not regarded as totally successful.&lt;ref name = "Transformers"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 engineer/architect William Zuk published the book ''Kinetic architecture''&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book  
|author = William Zuk
|title= Kinetic architecture
|year= 1970
|asin= B0006CF8OU 
|publisher= Reinhold
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which helped inspire a new generation of architects to design an increasingly wide range of actual working kinetic buildings. Assisted by new concepts such as Fuller's [[Tensegrity]] and by developments in [[robotics]], kinetic buildings have become increasingly common worldwide since the 1980s.&lt;ref name = "Transformers"/&gt;

==Themes==
[[File:2010-06-03 Arena AufSchalke 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Veltins-Arena]] in [[Gelsenkirchen]], Germany is an example of a stadium with a retractable roof and a retractable pitch]]
By the early 21st century three interrelated themes had emerged. The first is for functional buildings such as bridges which can elevate their midsections to allow tall ships to pass, or stadiums with retractable roofs such as the [[Veltins-Arena]], [[Millennium Stadium]] in Cardiff, or [[Wembley Stadium]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

A second theme is for fantastic structures that can perform [[Transformers|Transformer]] style changes of shape or which have a visually stunning appearance. 
The bird-like ''Burke [[Brise soleil]]'' at the [[Milwaukee Art Museum]] is a well regarded example of this, though it also has a functional aspect in that its movement allows it to shade the crowds from the sun or protect them from storms.&lt;ref name = "Transformers"/&gt;

The third theme is for movement to occur on the surface of the building, creating what Buckminster Fuller called a "skin-like articulation" effect. A classic example of this is the [[Arab World Institute|Institut du Monde Arabe]].&lt;ref name = "Transformers"/&gt;

==Other uses of the term==
Architects Sarah Bonnemaison and Christine Macy have suggested that movement can be an inspiring idea for architecture without the designs having to allow for actual movement – they can merely suggest it as was the case for some of the constructions of [[Antonio Gaudi|Gaudi]] or their own recent work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.subtletechnologies.com/2006/symposium/Bonnmaison-Macy.html Symposium on ''Architecture and Movement''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127153010/http://www.subtletechnologies.com/2006/symposium/Bonnmaison-Macy.html |date=27 November 2010 }} [[Dalhousie University]] (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''London Green500''' is [[London]] mayor [[Boris Johnson]]’s pioneering carbon mentoring programme. With the aim to lead London’s top organisations to reduce [[carbon emissions]] in the capital by 60% by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.green500.co.uk/cms/about/ About&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The London Green500 is led by a consortium on behalf of the [[London Development Agency]]. [[AEA Technology]] is the lead contractor, with [[Mouchel]], [[National Energy Foundation]], Futerra and Future Considerations.

== What is Green500? ==

The aim of Green500 is to enlist some of London’s largest and most prestigious organisations and mentor them through their carbon reduction commitments.

Green500 is one of a number of London Development Agency (LDA) [[London Development Agency]] initiatives, including Better Buildings Partnership, which aim to reduce London’s CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.  

Members of Green500 receive an initial assessment of their London specific carbon footprint from an expert Green500 Carbon Mentor.  Members are then presented with a tailored Action Plan outlining how they can reduce their carbon emissions.  
The individual Action Plans not only aim to reduce the member’s carbon footprint, but also estimates financial savings for energy, waste, water and transport.  The Green500 Action Plan also gives information on expected payback periods for each change, if implemented successfully. 

As well as providing a company specific Action Plan, Green500 also offers significant benefits to members including awards, networking opportunities and access to specialist suppliers.

A '''MET''' ('''M'''aterials, '''E'''nergy, and '''T'''oxicity) '''Matrix''' is an [[analysis]] tool used to evaluate various [[environmental impact]]s of a product over its [[Life cycle analysis|life cycle]].  The tool takes the form of a 3x3 matrix with descriptive text in each of its cells.  One dimension of the matrix is composed of a qualitative input-output model that examines environmental concerns related to the product's materials use, energy use, and [[toxicity]].  The other dimension looks at the [[Life cycle analysis|life cycle]] of the product through its production, use, and [[Waste management|disposal]] phase.  The text in each cell corresponds to the intersection of two particular aspects.  For example, this means that by looking at certain cells, one can examine aspects such as energy use during the production phase, or levels of [[toxicity]] that may be a concern during the [[Waste management|disposal]] phase.&lt;ref&gt;René van Berkel, Esther Willems, and Marije Lafleur (1997) "Development of an industrial ecology toolbox for the introduction of industrial ecology in enterprises - I" ''Journal of Cleaner Production'' 1997, 5:1-2, pp 11-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Translation sidebar}}

'''Medical translation''' is the practice of translating various documents—training materials, medical bulletins, drug data sheets, etc.—for health care, medical devices, marketing, or for clinical, regulatory, and technical documentation. Most countries require that companies and organizations translate literature and labeling for medical devices or pharmaceuticals into their national language. Documents for clinical trials often require translation for local clinicians and patients and regulatory representatives. Regulatory approval submissions typically must be translated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emergogroup.com/articles/how-europe-regulates-devices|title=Resource Library for Medical Device Professionals|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ce-mark.com/neweu.pdf|title=EU Medical and IVD Device Labeling: Translation Requirements and Trends |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to linguistic skills, medical translation requires specific training and subject matter knowledge because of the highly technical, sensitive, and regulated nature of medical texts.

==Process==
Medical translation steps can include:
* Extracting text from source format
* [[Translation|Translating]] text to the target language
* Editing by a separate person to assure adherence to approved terminology and proper style and voice
* Publishing the translation in the original format (e.g., Word document, Web page, e-learning program)
* [[Proofreading]] to ensure the formatted translation has proper punctuation and line and page breaks, and displays correctly 
* Reviewing in-country by a native-speaking expert to ensure the translation meets all requirements

Translation agencies may oversee both project management and linguistic aspects. [citation needed] 

==Quality and Standards==
The life and death nature of medical texts mandates a strong emphasis on translation quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fxtrans.com/2009/11/quality-is-dead-long-live-measurable.html|title=Long live translation quality|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international medical industry is highly regulated, and companies who must translate documentation typically choose translation agencies certified or compliant with one or more of the following standards:

* [[EN 15038]] — European standard for translation vendor quality ([[Translation-quality standards]])
* [[ISO 9001]] — Quality system standard
* [[ISO 13485]] — Overarching standard for medical device manufacture

[[File:Venable Hall HSC.JPG|thumb|right|390px|[[Venable Hall]] at all-male Hampden–Sydney College]]
'''[[Men's colleges]] in the United States''' are primarily those categorized as being [[undergraduate]], [[bachelor's degree]]-granting [[Single-sex education|single-sex]] institutions that admit only [[men]].  The most well-known men's colleges are traditional independent [[liberal arts college]]s, though the majority are institutions of learning for those preparing for religious vocations.

==History==
{{See also|Mixed-sex education}}
{{Education in the U.S.}}
Historically, many colleges in the [[United States]] were [[gender]]-segregated.  [[Alfred University]] in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] was founded in 1836 as a co-educational institution.   [[Northwestern University]] and [[Washington University in St. Louis]] were some of the first men's colleges to begin admitting women, doing so in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Documenting the Lives of Northwestern University Women | url = http://www.library.northwestern.edu/archives/womenresources.html | accessdate = 2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WashU&gt;{{cite web|title=Women at Washington University: Introduction |url=http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~whhep/washuwomenintro.html |accessdate=2010-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802124439/http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~whhep/washuwomenintro.html |archivedate=2010-08-02 |df= }} (Women admitted to law school in 1869; first undergrad in 1870)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, mixed-sex education did not become the norm until much later.  Notably, [[Wesleyan University]] began to admit women in 1872, but abandoned the practice in 1912, when it became all-male once again, and would not admit women again until 1972.&lt;ref name=Wesl&gt;{{cite web|title=Wesleyan University:A Brief History |url=http://www.wesleyan.edu/about/uhistory.html |accessdate=2010-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330145539/http://www.wesleyan.edu/about/uhistory.html |archivedate=2009-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, and particularly in 1969, most of the remaining male-only institutions began to admit women, including [[Georgetown University]], [[Princeton University]], [[Johns Hopkins University]] (women had previously been admitted to graduate programs only), and [[Yale University]]. [[Claremont McKenna College]], then Claremont Men's College, started admitting women in 1976 after being founded as a men's college for [[World War II]] veterans on the [[G.I. Bill]].  [[Columbia College of Columbia University]] held out even longer, and did not admit women until 1983, three years after [[Haverford College]] admitted its first female students. By that point, most men's colleges had already disappeared from the American academic landscape.

The most notable men's college to begin admitting women in recent years is the [[Virginia Military Institute]] (VMI), which had been sued by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] in 1990 for [[discrimination]].  The Department of Justice argued that since VMI was a public institution, it could not prevent women from attending based on gender alone.  Due to ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'', VMI admitted its first female [[cadet]]s in 1997.

Although most non-religious men's colleges now face the question of co-education, some new men's colleges have been proposed. One of the most frequently discussed is the [[Southern Military Institute]], which has been proposed as a new men-only alternative to the now co-educational VMI and [[The Citadel (military college)|The Citadel]], the latter of which admitted its first female students in 1993.

==Today==
{{As of |March 2017}}, there are three private, non-religious, four-year, all-male college institutions in the United States. These are:

* '''[[Wabash College]]''', [[Crawfordsville, Indiana]]
* '''[[Hampden–Sydney College]]''', [[Hampden Sydney, Virginia]]
* '''[[Morehouse College]]''', [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]

The [[Williamson Free School of Mechanical Trades]], which offers [[Associate's degree]]s, is not usually included on lists of traditional men's colleges, even though it enrolls no women, is an officially secular institution, and is not affiliated with any other institution.  There is also [[Deep Springs College]], a two-year liberal arts college in California that planned to begin admitting women for the class of 2013, but was later barred from doing so by a court decision citing the stipulations held within the college's founding trust that only "young men" would be allowed to attend.

Additionally, although many seminaries officially operate as men's colleges, some are also not frequently cited.  These include [[The Master's Seminary]] in [[Sun Valley, California|Sun Valley]], [[California]]; the [[Saint Meinrad School of Theology]] in [[Saint Meinrad, Indiana|Saint Meinrad]], [[Indiana]]; and [[Holy Apostles College and Seminary]] in [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]], [[Connecticut]].

===Counterparts and coordinates===
Some universities separate their undergraduate students into individual, gender-conscious colleges.  [[Yeshiva University]] oversees the all-male [[Yeshiva College (Yeshiva University)|Yeshiva College]] as well as the [[Stern College for Women]].  The [[University of Richmond]] has Richmond College for men and Westhampton College for women.

At [[Tulane University]], [[Newcomb-Tulane College|Tulane College]] was for men and [[H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College]] was for women. The two have now merged due to the financial devastation to the university after [[Hurricane Katrina]].

In each of these cases, the individual colleges have their own residence systems, advisors, staff, student governments, and traditions separate from their male or female counterpart.

In a slightly different arrangement, Hobart College is all-male and is the "coordinate," or partner, college of William Smith College, a women's college.  They are collectively known as [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]].  Unlike the single-sex colleges at Yeshiva and Richmond, they are not considered to be two colleges within one larger university, but instead two independent colleges joined together in a partnership arrangement, much like the [[College of Saint Benedict/Saint John's University|College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University]] in Minnesota, which have a shared co-educational academic program, but with [[College of Saint Benedict/Saint John's University|Saint Ben's]] enrolling women and [[College of Saint Benedict/Saint John's University|Saint John's]] enrolling men.

===Coeducational programs and services===
As with many women's colleges, some men's colleges do have a limited number of coeducational programs and services. Saint Meinrad and Holy Apostles allow limited enrollment for [[Laity|lay]] women in specially-designated courses, while Master's operates a [https://web.archive.org/web/20070513025919/http://www.tms.edu/semwivesweb/ Seminary Wives Discipleship] program on its campus for ten weeks each semester.  Hampden–Sydney provides a [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195006/http://www2.hsc.edu/studentlife/services/guesthouse.html female-only guest house] on its campus for college visitors.

==List of men's colleges==
As of April 2007, the [[College Board]] lists 66 colleges in the United States as officially being men's colleges. These are mostly [[Orthodox Jewish]] [[Yeshiva|Rabbinical college]]s (''yeshivas''), with a large concentration of Rabbinical colleges being located in the [[New York metropolitan area|New York City metropolitan area]].

According to the College Board's statistics, at least 15,183 men in April 2006 were attending the following institutions that are not open to female enrollment, with 13 schools not reporting their enrollment figures:

===Traditional institutions===
*[[Hampden–Sydney College]] ([[Hampden Sydney, Virginia|Hampden–Sydney]], [[Virginia]])
*[[Morehouse College]] ([[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]])
*[[College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University|Saint John's University]] ([[Collegeville Township, Stearns County, Minnesota|Collegeville]], [[Minnesota]])  (Saint John's University and the College of Saint Benedict share resources and a curriculum, while Hampden-Sydney College, Morehouse College, and Wabash College do not share resources or a curriculum with another school)
*[[Wabash College]] ([[Crawfordsville, Indiana|Crawfordsville]], [[Indiana]])
*[[Williamson College of the Trades]] (formerly [[Williamson Free School of Mechanical Trades]] ([[Media, Pennsylvania|Media]], [[Pennsylvania]]) (this is a three-year school instead of a four-year school like Hampden-Sydney College, Morehouse College and Wabash College)

'''NeoSon''' is an artistic movement developed in [[Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]], by a group of local artists, [[Tropico Suemba|Josué Pérez]] being  its main exponent. The movement was started in the early 1990s after a two-year tour by Pérez and Carlos "Charly" Garcia (one of the best [[multi-instrumentalist]]s in the country) through 13 countries in [[Latin America]], especially [[Brazil]]. The genesis was prompted by Pérez's perception of the lack of artistic innovation in Mexico experienced from the 1960s on. Although [[Mexican art]] has always had plenty of creative minds and people interested in its promotion, a considerable gap separated the country's artistic scene from those of other countries such as Brazil and [[Argentina]]. This separation was particularly felt after the concert of [[Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro|Avándaro]] (regarded as the Mexican [[Woodstock]]) in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.normal-records.com/main.php?a=3_Love%20Peace%20Poetry&amp;r=Vol.7%20Mexican Normal Records - Avandaro Festival]&lt;/ref&gt; after which rock music in the country was object of [[political repression|repression]]s by the government, the [[News media|media]] and the conservative part of Mexican society, until approximately 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maph49.galeon.com/avandaro/ingles/avandaro8.html After Avándaro: the black hole of mexican rock]&lt;/ref&gt; The repression caused a collapse in the young musicians' (and artists in general) creative and social objectives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neoson.mex.tl/132531_NeoSon-Manifesto.html NeoSon Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Payload''' is the carrying capacity of an [[aircraft]] or [[launch vehicle]], usually measured in terms of weight. Depending on the nature of the flight or mission, the payload of a vehicle may include [[cargo]], [[passenger]]s, [[flight crew]], [[munition]]s, scientific instruments or experiments, or other equipment. Extra fuel, when optionally carried, is also considered part of the payload. In a commercial context (i.e., an [[airline]] or [[air freight carrier]]), payload may refer only to revenue-generating cargo or paying passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/payload|title=Payload - Define Payload at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212080445/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/payload|archivedate=2013-12-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a rocket, the payload can be a [[satellite]], [[space probe]], or [[spacecraft]] carrying humans, animals, or cargo. For a [[ballistic missile]], the payload is one or more [[warhead]]s and related systems; the total weight of these systems is referred to as the [[throw-weight]].

The fraction of payload to the total liftoff weight of the air or spacecraft is known as the "[[payload fraction]]". When the weight of the payload and fuel are considered together, it is known as the "[[useful load fraction]]". In spacecraft, "mass fraction" is normally used, which is the ratio of payload to everything else, including the rocket structure.&lt;ref&gt;Launius, Roger D. Jenkins, Dennis R. 2002. ''To Reach the High Frontier: A History of U.S. Launch Vehicles''. Univ. Pr. of Kentucky. {{ISBN|978-0-8131-2245-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship of range and payload==
[[File:Payloadrange.jpg|thumb]]
There is a natural trade-off between the payload and the [[range (aircraft)|range]] of an aircraft. A payload range diagram (also known as the "elbow chart") illustrates the trade-off.

The top horizontal line represents the maximum payload. It is limited structurally by [[maximum zero-fuel weight]] (MZFW) of the aircraft. Maximum payload is the difference between maximum zero-fuel weight and operational empty weight (OEW). Moving left-to-right along the line shows the constant maximum payload as the range increases. More fuel needs to be added for more range.

The vertical line represents the range at which the combined weight of the aircraft, maximum payload and needed fuel reaches the [[maximum take-off weight]] (MTOW) of the aircraft. If the range is increased beyond that point, payload has to be sacrificed for fuel.

The maximum take-off weight is limited by a combination of the maximum net power of the engines and the lift/drag ratio of the wings. The diagonal line after the range-at-maximum-payload point shows how reducing the payload allows increasing the fuel (and range) when taking off with the maximum take-off weight.

The second kink in the curve represents the point at which the maximum fuel capacity is reached. Flying further than that point means that the payload has to be reduced further, for an even lesser increase in range. The absolute range is thus the range at which an aircraft can fly with maximum possible fuel without carrying any payload.

==Examples==
Examples of payload capacity:
*[[Antonov An-225 Mriya|Antonov An-225 ''Mriya'']]: 250,000&amp;nbsp;kg
*[[Saturn V]]:
**Payload to [[Low Earth Orbit]] 118,000&amp;nbsp;kg
**Payload to Lunar orbit 47,000&amp;nbsp;kg
*[[Space Shuttle]]:
**Payload to Low Earth Orbit 24,400&amp;nbsp;kg (53,700&amp;nbsp;lb)
**Payload to [[geostationary transfer orbit]] 3,810&amp;nbsp;kg (8,390&amp;nbsp;lb)
*[[Trident (missile)]]: 2800&amp;nbsp;kg {{specify|date=February 2015}}{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}
*[[Automated Transfer Vehicle]]
**Payload:&lt;ref&gt;http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/ATV/FS003_12_ATV_updated_launch_2008.pdf [[European Space Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt; 7,667&amp;nbsp;kg 8 racks with 2 x 0.314 m3 and 2 x 0.414 m3
**Envelope: each 1.146 m3 in front of 4 of these 8 racks
**Cargo mass: Dry cargo: 1,500 - 5,500&amp;nbsp;kg
**Water: 0 – 840&amp;nbsp;kg
**Gas (Nitrogen, Oxygen, air, 2 gases/flight): 0 – 100&amp;nbsp;kg
**ISS Refueling propellant: 0 – 860&amp;nbsp;kg (306&amp;nbsp;kg of fuel, 554&amp;nbsp;kg of oxidizer)
**ISS re-boost and attitude control propellant: 0 - 4,700&amp;nbsp;kg
**Total cargo upload capacity: 7,667&amp;nbsp;kg

==Structural capacity==
For aircraft, the weight of fuel in [[wing tank]]s does not contribute as significantly to the [[bending moment]] of the wing as does weight in the fuselage. So even when the airplane has been loaded with its maximum payload that the wings can support, it can still carry a significant amount of fuel.

==Payload constraints==
Launch and transport system differ not only on the payload that can be carried but also in the stresses and other factors placed on the payload.  The payload must not only be lifted to its target, it must also arrive safely, whether elsewhere on the surface of the Earth or a specific orbit.  To ensure this the payload, such as a warhead or satellite, is designed to withstand certain amounts of various types of "punishment" on the way to its destination.  Most rocket payloads are fitted within a [[payload fairing]] to protect them against [[dynamic pressure]] of high-velocity travel through the atmosphere, and to improve the overall aerodynamics of the launch vehicle. Most aircraft payloads are carried within the [[fuselage]] for similar reasons.  [[Outsize cargo]] may require a fuselage with unusual proportions, such as the [[Super Guppy]].

The various constraints placed on the launch system can be roughly categorized into those that cause physical damage to the payload and those that can damage its electronic or chemical makeup. Examples of physical damage include extreme accelerations over short time scales caused by atmospheric buffeting or oscillations, extreme accelerations over longer time scales caused by rocket thrust and gravity, and sudden changes in the magnitude or direction of the acceleration caused by how quick engines are throttled and shut down, etc. Electrical, chemical, or biological payloads can be damage by extreme temperatures (hot or cold), rapid changes in temperature or pressure, contact with fast moving air streams causing ionization, and radiation exposure from [[cosmic ray]]s, the [[van Allen belt]], or [[solar wind]].

==Detachable pod aircraft==
A new aircraft design is being developed where passengers are located within a pod. This [[detachable pod aircraft]] uses a passenger payload section that can be detached.

==History==
The hospitality management program at [[Penn State]] formally began in 1937 as an outgrowth of Institutional Management and was originally known as Hotel Administration.

In 1958, the program became Food Service and Housing Administration (FSHA), dividing the Hotel Administration major into two separate majors – Commercial Food Service and Institutional Resident Management.

In the 1970s, the program became focused on Service Management and Administrative Dietetics.

In 1981, the program name changed again, and the Department of Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Management (HRIM) was formed. The department was upgraded in 1987, and the School of Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Management was created. In 2005, the program was renamed the School of Hospitality Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hhdev.psu.edu/shm/about/history |title=History &amp;#124; Hospitality Management at Penn State |publisher=Hhdev.psu.edu |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mateer Building and Cafe Laura==
[[File:Mateer Building- Penn State School of Hospitality Management.JPG|thumb|Mateer Building- Penn State School of Hospitality Management]]
The School of Hospitality Management is located in the Mateer Building on the northwest corner of Penn State's [[University Park, PA|University Park campus]] near the intersection of [[Atherton Street]] and Park Avenue. Mateer was completed in 1993 and is named after A. Laura Mateer and her husband M.C. "Matty" Mateer in whose memory she had donated $1.5 million to the School.  Mateer is the host to Cafe Laura, the Center for Food Innovation, the Career Center, conference rooms, faculty offices, a computer laboratory and classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hhdev.psu.edu/shm/about/history |title=History &amp;#124; Hospitality Management at Penn State |publisher=Hhdev.psu.edu |accessdate=2014-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cafe Laura, named for Laura Mateer, is the student-run restaurant located in the Mateer Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Feretich |first=Nicole |url=http://psu.spoonuniversity.com/2014/03/30/cafe-laura-penn-states-student-run-restaurant/ |title=Cafe Laura- Penn State |publisher=Psu.spoonuniversity.com |date=2014-03-30 |accessdate=2014-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809235507/http://psu.spoonuniversity.com/2014/03/30/cafe-laura-penn-states-student-run-restaurant/ |archivedate=2014-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the supervision of instructors, students receive hands-on restaurant experience in a laid back lunch setting and a formal theme dinner setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alyse Horn |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_5abe41be-fd13-5efa-89e4-d4f252b74ee7.html |title=Cafe Laura offers themed dinners prepared by students - The Daily Collegian: Archives |publisher=Collegian.psu.edu |date=2011-07-21 |accessdate=2014-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Café Laura underwent a significant make-over in 2013, with an all new dining area including tables, chairs, carpeting, painting, artwork, signage, lighting fixtures, equipment and window treatments, new menus and the addition of grab-and-go equipment and service.

'''Plant genetics''' is the study of [[Gene|genes]], [[genetic variation]], and [[heredity]] specifically in [[Plant|Plants]].&lt;ref name="griffiths2000sect60"&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Genetic Analysis|publisher=W.

Plant genetics is similar in many ways to animal genetics but differs in a few key areas.

The discoverer of genetics is [[Gregor Mendel]], a late 19th-century scientist and [[Augustinian]] [[friar]]. Mendel studied "trait inheritance", patterns in the way traits are handed down from parents to offspring. He observed that organisms (most famously pea plants) inherit traits by way of discrete "units of inheritance". This term, still used today, is a somewhat ambiguous definition of what is referred to as a [[gene]]. Much of Mendel's work with plants still forms the basis for modern plant genetics.

Plants, like all known organisms, use DNA to pass on their traits. Animal genetics often focuses on parentage and lineage, but this can sometimes be difficult in plant genetics due to the fact that plants can, unlike most animals, can [[Self-Fertilization|self-fertilize]]. [[Speciation]] can be easier in many plants due to unique genetic abilities, such as being well adapted to [[Polyploid|polyploidy]]. Plants are unique in that they are able to produce energy-dense carbohydrates via [[photosynthesis]], a process which is achieved by use of a structure mostly exclusive to plants: [[Chloroplast|chloroplasts]]. Chloroplasts, like the superficially similar [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]], possess their own DNA. Chloroplasts thus provide an additional reservoir for genes and genetic diversity, and an extra layer of genetic complexity not found in animals. 

The study of plant genetics has major economic impacts: many staple crops are [[Genetically modified crops|genetically modified]] to increase yields, confer pest and disease resistance, provide resistance to herbicides, or to increase their nutritional value. 

==History==

The earliest evidence of plant [[Domestication of wheat|domestication]] found has been dated to 11,000 years before present in ancestral wheat. While initially selection may have happened unintentionally, it is very likely that by 5,000 years ago farmers had a basic understanding of heredity and inheritance, the foundation of genetics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allard|first=Robert W.|date=1999-12|title=History of Plant Population Genetics|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.genet.33.1.1|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|language=en|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–27|doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.33.1.1|issn=0066-4197}}&lt;/ref&gt; This selection over time gave rise to new crop species and varieties that are the basis of the crops we grow, eat and research today.[[File:Gregor Mendel oval.jpg|thumb|203x203px|Gregor Mendel, the "Father of genetics"]]The field of plant genetics began with the work of [[Gregor Mendel|Gregor Johann Mendel]], who is often called the "father of genetics". He was an [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[priest]] and scientist born on 20 July 1822 in Austria-Hungary. He worked at the Abbey of St. Thomas in Bruno , where his organism of choice for studying [[Heredity|inheritance]] and  [[Trait (biological)|trait]]s was the [[Pea|pea plant]]. Mendel's work tracked many [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] traits of pea plants, such as their height, flower color, and seed characteristics. Mendel showed that the inheritance of these traits follows two particular [[Mendelian inheritance|laws]], which were later named after him. His seminal work on genetics, “Versuche über Pflanzen-Hybriden” (Experiments on Plant Hybrids), was published in 1866, but went almost entirely unnoticed until 1900 when prominent botanists in the UK, like [[Sir Gavin de Beer]], recognized its importance and re-published an English translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bshs.org.uk/bshs-translations/mendel|title=1. Gregor Mendel: Versuche über Pflanzen-Hybriden|website=www.bshs.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendel died in 1884. The significance of Mendel's work was not recognized until the turn of the 20th century. Its rediscovery prompted the foundation of modern genetics. His discoveries, deduction of [[Punnett square|segregation ratios]], and subsequent [[Mendel's law|laws]] have not only been used in research to gain a better understanding of plant genetics, but also play a large role in [[plant breeding]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mendel's works along with the works of [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Alfred Wallace]] on selection provided the basis for much of genetics as a discipline. 

In the early 1900s, botanists and statisticians began to examine the segregation ratios put forth by Mendel. W.E. Castle discovered that while individual traits may segregate and change over time with selection, that when selection is stopped and environmental effects are taken into account, the genetic ratio stops changing and reach a sort of stasis, the foundation of [[Population genetics|Population Genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castle|first=W.

Hardy and W. Weinberg, which ultimately gave rise to the concept of [[Hardy-weinberg equilibrium|Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium]] published in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardy|first=G.

Around this same time, genetic and plant breeding experiments in [[maize]] began. Maize that has been self-pollinated experiences a phenomena called [[inbreeding depression]]. Researchers, like [[Nils Heribert-Nilsson]], recognized that by crossing plants and forming hybrids, they were not only able to combine traits from two desirable parents, but the crop also experienced [[heterosis]] or [[hybrid vigor]]. This was the beginning of identifying gene interactions or [[epistasis]]. By the early 1920's, [[Donald Forsha Jones]] had invented a method that led to the first hybrid maize seed that were available commercially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/oc/timeline/corn/|title=corn : USDA ARS|website=www.ars.usda.gov|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large demand for hybrid seed in the U.S. Corn Belt by the mid 1930's led to a rapid growth in the seed production industry and ultimately seed research. The strict requirements for producing hybrid seed led to the development of careful population and inbred line maintenance, keeping plants isolated and unable to out-cross, which produced plants that better allowed researchers to tease out different genetic concepts. The structure of these populations allowed scientist such a [[Theodosius Dobzhansky|T. Dobzhansky]], [[Sewall Wright|S. Wright]], and [[Ronald Fisher|R.A. Fisher]] to develop [[evolutionary biology]] concepts as well as explore [[speciation]] over time and the statistics underlying plant genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19391601696|title=CAB Direct|website=www.cabdirect.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Sewall|date=1940-05|title=Breeding Structure of Populations in Relation to Speciation|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/280891?journalCode=an|journal=The American Naturalist|language=en|volume=74|issue=752|pages=232–248|doi=10.1086/280891|issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=f7su1R-NYwsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=dobzhansky&amp;ots=HI9NizMWrr&amp;sig=cg7p4ZWKjxIOZ5LcbACCUgcL3s0#v=onepage&amp;q=dobzhansky&amp;f=false|title=Genetics of the Evolutionary Process|last=Dobzhansky|first=Theodosius|last2=Dobzhansky|first2=Theodosius Grigorievich|date=1970|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231083065|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their work layed the foundations for future genetic discoveries such as [[linkage disequilibrium]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewontin|first=R.

While breeding experiments were taking place, other scientists such as [[Nikolai Vavilov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ivanovich)|first=Vavilov, N. I. (Nikolaĭ|last2=1887-1943|date=1926|title=Studies on the origin of cultivated plants|url=http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300329962|journal=AGRIS: International Information System for the Agricultural Science and Technology|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [https://tgrc.ucdavis.edu/charlie.aspx Charles M. Rick] were interested in wild [[progenitor]] species of modern crop plants. Botanists between the 1920's and 1960's often would travel to regions of high plant [[Genetic diversity|diversity]] and seek out wild species that had given rise to domesticated species after selection. Determining how crops changed over time with selection was initially based on morphological features. It developed over time to chromosomal analysis, then [[genetic marker]] analysis, and eventual [[Genome-wide complex trait analysis|genomic analysis]]. Identifying traits and their underlying genetics allowed for transferring useful genes and the traits they controlled from either wild or mutant plants to crop plants. Understanding and manipulating of plant genetics was in its heyday during the [[Green Revolution]] brought about by [[Norman Borlaug]]. During this time, the molecule of heredity, DNA, was also discovered, which allowed scientists to actually examine and manipulate genetic information directly.

==DNA==
[[Image:DNA Overview.png|thumb|100px|The structure of part of a DNA double helix]]
[[Deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) is a [[nucleic acid]] that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms and some viruses. The main role of DNA molecules is the long-term storage of information. DNA is often compared to a set of blueprints or a recipe, or a code, since it contains the instructions needed to construct other components of cells, such as proteins and [[RNA]] molecules. The DNA segments that carry this genetic information are called genes, and their location within the genome are referred to as [[genetic loci]], but other DNA sequences have structural purposes, or are involved in regulating the use of this genetic information. 

[[Geneticist]]s, including [[plant geneticist]]s, use this sequence of DNA to their advantage to better find and understand the role of different genes within a given genome. Through research and plant breeding, manipulation of different plant genes and loci encoded by the DNA sequence of the plant chromosomes by various methods can be done to produce different or desired [[genotype|genotypes]] that result in different or desired [[phenotype|phenotypes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dudley|first=J.

== Plant Specific Genetics ==
Plants, like all other known living organisms, pass on their traits using [[DNA]]. Plants however are unique from other living organisms in the fact that they have [[Chloroplast|Chloroplasts]]. Like [[mitochondria]], chloroplasts have their own [[chloroplast#chloroplast DNA|DNA]]. Like animals, plants experience [[somatic mutation]]s regularly, but these mutations can contribute to the [[germ line]] with ease, since flowers develop at the ends of branches composed of somatic cells. People have known of this for centuries, and mutant branches are called "[[Sport (botany)|sports]]". If the fruit on the sport is economically desirable, a new [[cultivar]] may be obtained.

Some plant species are capable of [[self-fertilization]], and some are nearly exclusively self-fertilizers. This means that a plant can be both mother and father to its offspring, a rare occurrence in animals. Scientists and hobbyists attempting to make crosses between different plants must take special measures to prevent the plants from self-fertilizing. In [[plant breeding]], people create [[Hybrid_(biology)#Hybrid_plants|hybrids]] between plant species for economic and aesthetic reasons. For example, the yield of [[Corn]] has increased nearly five-fold in the past century due in part to the discovery and proliferation of hybrid corn varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://passel.unl.edu/pages/informationmodule.php?idinformationmodule=1075412493&amp;topicorder=10&amp;maxto=12|title=Plant and Soil Sciences eLibrary|website=passel.unl.edu|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant genetics can be used to predict which combination of plants may produce a plant with [[Hybrid vigor]], or conversely many discoveries in Plant genetics have come from studying the effects of hybridization.

Plants are generally more capable of surviving, and indeed flourishing, as [[polyploid]]s. Polyploid organisms have more than two sets of homologous chromosomes. For example, humans have two sets of homologous chromosomes, meaning that a typical human will have 2 copies each of 23 different chromosomes, for a total of 46. [[Wheat]] on the other hand, while having only 7 distinct chromosomes, is considered a hexaploid and has 6 copies of each chromosome, for a total of 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://coloradowheat.org/2013/11/why-is-the-wheat-genome-so-complicated/|title=Why is the Wheat Genome So Complicated? {{!}} Colorado Wheat|website=coloradowheat.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In animals, inheritable germline polyploidy is less common, and spontaneous chromosome increases may not even survive past fertilization. In plants however this is no such problem, polyploid individuals are created frequently by a variety of processes, however once created usually cannot cross back to the parental type. Polyploid individuals, if capable of self-fertilizing, can give rise to a new genetically distinct lineage, which can be the start of a new species. This is often called "instant [[speciation]]". Polyploids generally have larger fruit, an economically desirable trait, and many human food crops, including wheat, [[maize]], [[potatoes]], [[peanut]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2012-01-01|title=Expression of an Arabidopsis sodium/proton antiporter gene (AtNHX1) in peanut to improve salt tolerance - Springer|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11816-011-0200-5|journal=Plant Biotechnology Reports|publisher=Link.springer.com|volume=6|pages=59–67|doi=10.1007/s11816-011-0200-5|accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[strawberries]] and [[tobacco]], are either accidentally or deliberately created polyploids.

{{Expand section||date=June 2018}}

====''Arabidopsis thaliana''====

[[Arabidopsis thaliana|''Arabidopsis thaliana'']], also known as thale cress, has been the model organism for the study of plant genetics. As [[Drosophila melanogaster|Drosphila]], a species of fruit fly, was to the understanding of early genetics, so has been arabidopsis to the understanding of plant genetics. It was the first plant to ever have its genome sequenced in the year 2000. It has a small genome, making the initial sequencing more attainable. It has a genome size of 125 [[Base pair|Mbp]] that encodes about 25,000 genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2000-12|title=Analysis of the genome sequence of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/35048692|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=408|issue=6814|pages=796–815|doi=10.1038/35048692|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because an incredible amount of research has been done on the plant, a database called [[The Arabidopsis Information Resource]] (TAIR) has been established as a repository for multiple data sets and information on the species. Information housed in TAIR include the complete genome sequence along with [[gene structure]], gene product information, [[gene expression]], DNA and seed stocks, genome maps, genetic and physical [[Genetic marker|markers]], publications, and information about the Arabidopsis research community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arabidopsis.org/|title=TAIR - Home Page|website=www.arabidopsis.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several [[Ecotype|ecotypes]] of arabidopsis that have been useful in genetic research, and the natural variation has been used to identify [[Quantitative trait locus|loci]] important in both [[Biotic stress|biotic]] and [[abiotic stress]] resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2000-01-01|title=Naturally occurring variation in Arabidopsis: an underexploited resource for plant genetics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138599015101|journal=Trends in Plant Science|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|pages=22–29|doi=10.1016/S1360-1385(99)01510-1|issn=1360-1385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Brachypodium distachyon'' ====
''[[Brachypodium distachyon]]'' is an experimental model grass that has many attributes that make it an excellent model for temperate cereals. Unlike wheat, a tetra or [[hexaploid]] species, brachypodium is diploid with a relatively small genome (~355 Mbp) with a short life-cycle, making genomic studies on it simpler. ''([[Agronomy]], [[Molecular biology]], [[Genetics]]''

==== ''Nicotiana benthamiana'' ====
''[[Nicotiana benthamiana]]'' is often considered a model organism for both plant-pathogen and transgenic studies. Because it is easily transformed with ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]'', it is used to study both the [[Gene expression|expression]] of pathogen genes introduced into a plant or test new genetic [[Gene cassette|cassette]] effects. 

==Genetically modified crops==
{{main article|Genetically modified food}}

Genetically modified (GM) foods are produced from [[organism]]s that have had changes introduced into their [[DNA]] using the methods of [[genetic engineering]]. Genetic engineering techniques allow for the introduction of new traits as well as greater control over traits than previous methods such as [[selective breeding]] and [[mutation breeding]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file15655.pdf GM Science Review First Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016100707/http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file15655.pdf |date=October 16, 2013 }}, Prepared by the UK GM Science Review panel (July 2003).

Since the introduction of GM crops, yields have increased by 22%, and profits have increased to farmers, especially in the developing world, by 68%. An important side effect of GM crops has been decreased land requirements, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/2018/02/gmo-crops-increasing-yield-20-years-progress-ahead/|title=GMO crops have been increasing yield for 20 years, with more progress ahead - Alliance for Science|work=Alliance for Science|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern ways to genetically modify plants==

Genetic modification has been the cause for much research into modern plant genetics, and has also lead to the [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] of many plant genomes. Today there are two predominant procedures of [[transformation (genetics)|transforming]] genes in organisms: the "[[Gene gun]]" method and the ''[[Agrobacterium]]'' method.

==="Gene gun" method===

The [[gene gun]] method is also referred to as "biolistics" ([[ballistics]] using biological components). This technique is used for [[in vivo]] (within a living organism) transformation and has been especially useful in [[monocotyledon|monocot]] species like [[maize|corn]] and rice.This approach literally shoots genes into plant cells and plant cell chloroplasts. DNA is coated onto small particles of gold or [[tungsten]] approximately two micrometres in diameter. The particles are placed in a vacuum chamber and the plant tissue to be engineered is placed below the chamber. The particles are propelled at high velocity using a short pulse of high pressure helium gas, and hit a fine mesh baffle placed above the tissue while the DNA coating continues into any target cell or [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]].

===''Agrobacterium'' method===
Transformation via [[Agrobacterium]] has been successfully practiced in [[dicotyledon|dicots]], i.e. broadleaf plants, such as [[soybean]]s and [[tomato]]es, for many years. Recently it has been adapted and is now effective in monocots like grasses, including corn and rice. In general, the ''Agrobacterium'' method is considered preferable to the gene gun, because of a greater [[frequency]] of single-site insertions of the foreign DNA, which allows for easier monitoring. In this method, the [[tumor]] inducing (Ti) region is removed from the T-DNA (transfer DNA) and replaced with the desired gene and a marker, which is then inserted into the organism. This may involve direct inoculation of the tissue with a culture of transformed Agrobacterium, or inoculation following treatment with micro-projectile bombardment, which wounds the tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bidney|first1=D|last2=Scelonge|first2=C|last3=Martich|first3=J|last4=Burrus|first4=M|last5=Sims|first5=L|last6=Huffman|first6=G|date=January 1992|title=Microprojectile bombardment of plant tissues increases transformation frequency by Agrobacterium tumefaciens|journal=Plant Mol. Biol.|volume=18|issue=2|pages=301–13|doi=10.1007/bf00034957|pmid=1310058}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wounding of the target tissue causes the release of phenolic compounds by the plant, which induces invasion of the tissue by Agrobacterium. Because of this, microprojectile bombardment often increases the efficiency of infection with Agrobacterium.  The marker is used to find the organism which has successfully taken up the desired gene. Tissues of the organism are then transferred to a medium containing an [[antibiotic]] or [[herbicide]], depending on which marker was used. The ''[[Agrobacterium]]'' present is also killed by the antibiotic. Only tissues expressing the marker will survive and possess the gene of interest. Thus, subsequent steps in the process will only use these surviving plants. In order to obtain whole plants from these tissues, they are grown under controlled environmental conditions in [[plant tissue culture|tissue culture]]. This is a process of a series of media, each containing nutrients and [[hormones]]. Once the plants are grown and produce seed, the process of evaluating the [[Offspring|progeny]] begins. This process entails selection of the seeds with the desired traits and then retesting and growing to make sure that the entire process has been completed successfully with the desired results.

'''Protein–protein interactions''' ('''PPIs''') are the physical contacts of high specificity established between two or more [[protein]] molecules as a result of biochemical events steered by [[electrostatic forces]] including the [[hydrophobic effect]]. Many are physical contacts with molecular associations between chains that occur in a cell or in a living organism in a specific biomolecular context.&lt;ref name="Rivas"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = De Las Rivas J, Fontanillo C | title = Protein-protein interactions essentials: key concepts to building and analyzing interactome networks | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000807 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20589078 | pmc = 2891586 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000807 | bibcode = 2010PLSCB...6E0807D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many molecular processes within a cell are carried out by molecular machines that are built from a large number of protein components organized by their PPIs. These interactions make up the so-called [[Interactome|interactomics]] of the organism, while aberrant PPIs are the basis of multiple aggregation-related diseases, such as [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease|Creutzfeldt–Jakob]], [[Alzheimer's disease]]s, and may lead to cancer.

PPIs have been studied from different perspectives: [[biochemistry]], [[quantum chemistry]], [[molecular dynamics]], [[signal transduction]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Herce HD, Deng W, Helma J, Leonhardt H, Cardoso MC | title = Visualization and targeted disruption of protein interactions in living cells | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 4 | issue =  | page = 2660 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24154492 | pmc = 3826628 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms3660 | bibcode = 2013NatCo...4E2660H }}&lt;/ref&gt; All this information enables the creation of large protein interaction networks – similar to [[Metabolic network|metabolic]] or [[Genetic networks|genetic/epigenetic networks]] – that empower the current knowledge on [[biochemical cascade]]s and molecular etiology of disease, as well as the discovery of putative protein targets of therapeutic interest.

== Examples ==

===Electron transfer proteins===
In many metabolic reactions, a protein that acts as an electron carrier binds to an enzyme that acts its reductase. After it receives an electron, it dissociates and then binds to the next enzyme that acts its oxidase (i.e. acceptor of the electron). These interactions between proteins are dependent on highly specific binding between proteins to ensure efficient electron transfer. Examples: mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation chain system components cytochrome c-reductase / cytochrome c / cytochrome c oxidase; microsomal and mitochondrial P450 systems.&lt;ref name="1996-Hanukoglu"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Hanukoglu I | title = Electron transfer proteins of cytochrome P450 systems | journal = Adv.

In the case of the mitochondrial P450 systems, the specific residues involved in the binding of the electron transfer protein [[adrenodoxin]] to its reductase were identified as two basic Arg residues on the surface of the reductase and two acidic Asp residues on the adrenodoxin.&lt;ref name="pmid8349601"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Brandt ME, Vickery LE| title=Charge pair interactions stabilizing ferredoxin-ferredoxin reductase complexes.

More recent work on the phylogeny of the reductase has shown that these residues involved in protein-protein interactions have been conserved throughout the evolution of this enzyme.&lt;ref name="2017-Hanukoglu-JME"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanukoglu I | title = Conservation of the Enzyme-Coenzyme Interfaces in FAD and NADP Binding Adrenodoxin Reductase-A Ubiquitous Enzyme | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 85 | issue= 5 | pages= 205–218 | year= 2017 | pmid= 29177972 | doi= 10.1007/s00239-017-9821-9 | url=| bibcode= 2017JMolE..85..205H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signal transduction===
The activity of the cell is regulated by extracellular signals. Signal propagation inside and/or along the interior of cells depends on PPIs between the various signaling molecules. The recruitment of signaling pathways through PPIs is called [[signal transduction]] and plays a fundamental role in many biological processes and in many diseases including [[Parkinson's disease]] and cancer.

===Transport across membranes===
A protein may be carrying another protein (for example, from [[cytoplasm]] to [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] or vice versa in the case of the [[nuclear pore]] importins).

===Cell metabolism===
In many biosynthetic processes [[enzymes]] interact with each other to produce small compounds or other macromolecules.

===Muscle contraction===
Physiology of [[muscle contraction]] involves several interactions. [[Myosin]] filaments act as molecular motors and by binding to [[actin]] enables filament sliding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=G.M. | name-list-format =vanc |title=The cell : a molecular approach|year=2000|publisher=ASM Press |location=Washington DC |isbn=978-0-87893-106-4|edition=2nd}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, members of the [[skeletal muscle]] [[lipid droplet-associated protein]]s family associate with other proteins, as activator of [[adipose triglyceride lipase]] and its [[coactivator]] comparative gene identification-58, to regulate [[lipolysis]] in skeletal muscle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = MacPherson RE, Ramos SV, Vandenboom R, Roy BD, Peters SJ | title = Skeletal muscle PLIN proteins, ATGL and CGI-58, interactions at rest and following stimulated contraction | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

== Types ==
{{Main|Multiprotein complex}}
To describe the types of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) it is important to consider that proteins can interact in a "transient" way (to produce some specific effect in a short time) or to interact with other proteins in a "stable" way to build  multiprotein complexes  that are molecular machines within the living systems. A protein complex assembly can result in the formation of [[Oligomer|homo-oligomeric or hetero-oligomeric complexes]]. In addition to the conventional complexes, as enzyme-inhibitor and antibody-antigen, interactions can also be established between domain-domain and domain-peptide. Another important distinction to identify protein-protein interactions is the way they have been determined, since there are techniques that measure direct physical interactions between protein pairs, named “binary” methods, while there are other techniques that measure physical interactions among groups of proteins, without pairwise determination of protein partners, named “co-complex” methods.&lt;ref name="Rivas"/&gt;

=== Homo-oligomers vs. hetero-oligomers ===
Homo-oligomers  are macromolecular complexes constituted by only one type of [[protein subunit]]. Protein subunits assembly is guided by the establishment of [[non-covalent interactions]] in the [[quaternary structure]] of the protein. Disruption of homo-oligomers in order to return to the initial individual [[monomers]] often requires denaturation of the complex.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; Several [[enzymes]], [[carrier proteins]], scaffolding proteins, and transcriptional regulatory factors carry out their functions as homo-oligomers. 
Distinct protein subunits interact in  hetero-oligomers, which are essential to control several cellular functions. The importance of the communication between heterologous proteins is even more evident during cell signaling events and such interactions are only possible due to structural domains within the proteins (as described below).

=== Stable interactions vs. transient interactions ===
Stable interactions  involve proteins that interact for a long time, taking part of permanent complexes as subunits, in order to carry out structural or functional roles. These are usually the case of homo-oligomers (e.g. [[cytochrome c]]), and some hetero-oligomeric proteins, as the subunits of [[ATPase]]. On the other hand, a protein may interact briefly and in a [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] manner with other proteins in only certain cellular contexts – [[cell type]], [[Cell cycle|cell cycle stage]], external factors, presence of other binding proteins, etc. – as it happens with most of the proteins involved in [[biochemical cascade]]s. These are called  transient interactions. For example, some G protein-coupled receptors only transiently bind to G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt; proteins when they are activated by extracellular ligands,&lt;ref name="pmid=18434433"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin K, Sethi PR, Lambert NA | title = Abundance and stability of complexes containing inactive G protein-coupled receptors and G proteins | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 22 | issue = 8 | pages = 2920–7 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18434433 | pmc = 2493464 | doi = 10.1096/fj.08-105775 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while some G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;-coupled receptors, such as muscarinic receptor M3, pre-couple with G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; proteins prior to the receptor-ligand binding.&lt;ref name="pmid=21873996"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin K, Dong C, Wu G, Lambert NA | title = Inactive-state preassembly of G(q)-coupled receptors and G(q) heterotrimers | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 10 | pages = 740–7 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21873996 | pmc = 3177959 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.642 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactions between intrinsically disordered protein regions to globular protein domains (i.e. [[MoRFs]]) are transient interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Malhis N, Gsponer J | title = Computational identification of MoRFs in protein sequences | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 31 | issue = 11 | pages = 1738–44 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25637562 | pmc = 4443681 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btv060 | access-date =  | lastauthoramp = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Covalent vs. non-covalent===
{{Main|Covalent bond|Non-covalent interactions}}
Covalent interactions  are those with the strongest association and are formed by [[disulphide bonds]] or [[Atomic orbital|electron sharing]]. Although being rare, these interactions are determinant in some [[posttranslational modifications]], as [[ubiquitination]] and [[SUMOylation]].  Non-covalent bonds  are usually established during transient interactions by the combination of weaker bonds, such as [[hydrogen bonds]], ionic interactions, [[Van der Waals force]]s, or hydrophobic bonds.&lt;ref name="Jukka" /&gt;

===Role of water===
Water molecules play a significant role in the interactions between proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Janin J | title = Wet and dry interfaces: the role of solvent in protein-protein and protein-DNA recognition | journal = Structure | volume = 7 | issue = 12 | pages = R277–9 | date = December 1999 | pmid = 10647173 | doi = 10.1016/s0969-2126(00)88333-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barillari C, Taylor J, Viner R, Essex JW | title = Classification of water molecules in protein binding sites | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 129 | issue = 9 | pages = 2577–87 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17288418 | doi = 10.1021/ja066980q }}&lt;/ref&gt; The crystal structures of complexes, obtained at high resolution from different but homologous proteins, have shown that some interface water molecules are conserved between homologous complexes. The majority of the interface water molecules make hydrogen bonds with both partners of each complex. Some interface amino acid residues or atomic groups of one protein partner engage in both direct and water mediated interactions with the other protein partner. Doubly indirect interactions, mediated by two water molecules, are more numerous in the homologous complexes of low affinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lisova O, Belkadi L, Bedouelle H | title = Direct and indirect interactions in the recognition between a cross-neutralizing antibody and the four serotypes of dengue virus | journal = Journal of Molecular Recognition | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 205–14 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24591178 | doi = 10.1002/jmr.2352 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carefully conducted mutagenesis experiments, e.g. changing a tyrosine residue into a phenylalanine, have shown that water mediated interactions can contribute to the energy of interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = England P, Brégégère F, Bedouelle H | title = Energetic and kinetic contributions of contact residues of antibody D1.3 in the interaction with lysozyme | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 164–72 | date = January 1997 | pmid = 8993330 | doi = 10.1021/bi961419y | citeseerx = 10.1.1.613.413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, water molecules may facilitate the interactions and cross-recognitions between proteins.

Later, [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] also started to be applied with the aim of unravelling the molecular structure of protein complexes.

=== Domains  ===
Proteins hold structural domains that allow their interaction with and bind to specific sequences on other proteins:

*  ''Src homology 2 (SH2) domain '' {{Main|SH2 domain}} 
:SH2 domains are structurally composed by three-stranded twisted beta sheet sandwiched flanked by two alpha-helices. The existence of a deep binding pocket with high affinity for [[phosphotyrosine]], but not for [[phosphoserine]] or [[phosphothreonine]], is essential for the recognition of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, mainly autophosphorylated [[growth factor]] receptors. Growth factor receptor binding proteins and [[phospholipase C]]γ are examples of proteins that have SH2 domains.&lt;ref name=Berridge&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berridge|first=M.J.|title=Cell Signalling Biology: Module 6 – Spatial and Temporal Aspects of Signalling|journal=Biochemical Journal|volume=6|pages=csb0001006|year=2012|doi=10.1042/csb0001006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*  ''Src homology 3 (SH3) domain '' {{Main|SH3 domain}}
:Structurally, SH3 domains are constituted by a beta barrel formed by two orthogonal beta sheets and three anti-parallel beta strands. These domains recognize [[proline]] enriched sequences, as polyproline type II helical structure (PXXP motifs){{Verify source|date=August 2014}} in cell signaling proteins like protein [[tyrosine kinases]] and the growth factor receptor bound protein 2 ([[Grb2]]).&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;

*  ''Phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain '' {{Main|PTB domain}}
:PTB domains interact with sequences that contain a phosphotyrosine group. These domains can be found in the [[insulin receptor substrate]].&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;

*  ''LIM domain '' {{Main|LIM domain}}
:LIM domains were initially identified in three [[homeodomain transcription factors]] (lin11, is11, and mec3). In addition to this [[homeodomain proteins]] and other proteins involved in development, LIM domains have also been identified in non-homeodomain proteins with relevant roles in [[cellular differentiation]], association with [[cytoskeleton]] and [[senescence]]. These domains contain a tandem cysteine-rich [[Zn-finger|Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-finger motif]] and embrace the [[consensus sequence]] CX2CX16-23HX2CX2CX2CX16-21CX2C/H/D. LIM domains bind to PDZ domains, bHLH transcription factors, and other LIM domains.&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;
*  ''Sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain '' {{Main|SAM domain}}
:SAM domains are composed by five helices forming a compact package with a conserved [[hydrophobic core]]. These domains, which can be found in the [[Eph receptor]] and the stromal interaction molecule ([[STIM]]) for example, bind to non-SAM domain-containing proteins and they also appear to have the ability to bind [[RNA]].&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;
*  ''PDZ domain '' {{Main|PDZ domain}}
:PDZ domains were first identified in three guanylate kinases: PSD-95, DlgA and ZO-1. These domains recognize carboxy-terminal tri-peptide motifs (S/TXV), other [[PDZ domain]]s or [[LIM domain]]s and bind them through a short peptide sequence that has a [[C-terminal]] hydrophobic residue. Some of the proteins identified as having PDZ domains are scaffolding proteins or seem to be involved in ion receptor assembling and receptor-enzyme complexes formation.&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;
*  ''FERM domain '' {{Main|FERM domain}}
:FERM domains contain basic residues capable of binding [[Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate|PtdIns(4,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. [[Talin protein|Talin]] and [[focal adhesion kinase]] (FAK) are two of the proteins that present FERM domains.&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;
*  ''Calponin homology (CH) domain '' {{Main|Calponin homology domain}}
:CH domains are mainly present in cytoskeletal proteins as [[PARVA|parvin]].&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;
*  ''Pleckstrin homology domain '' {{Main|Pleckstrin homology domain}}
:Pleckstrin homology domains bind to phosphoinositides and acid domains in signaling proteins.
*  ''WW domain '' {{Main|WW domain}}
:WW domains bind to proline enriched sequences.
*  ''WSxWS motif '' 
:Found in cytokine receptors

==Properties of the interface==
The study of the molecular structure can give fine details about the interface that enables the interaction between proteins. When characterizing PPI interfaces it is important to take into account the type of complex.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones S, Thornton JM | title = Principles of protein-protein interactions | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 93 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–20 | date = January 1996 | pmid = 8552589 | pmc = 40170 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.1.13 | bibcode = 1996PNAS...93...13J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parameters evaluated include size (measured in absolute dimensions [[Angstrom|Å&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] or in [[Solvent accessible surface area|solvent-accessible surface area (SASA)]]), shape, complementarity between surfaces, residue interface propensities, hydrophobicity, segmentation and secondary structure, and conformational changes on complex formation.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;

The great majority of PPI interfaces reflects the composition of protein surfaces, rather than the protein cores, in spite of being frequently enriched in hydrophobic residues, particularly in aromatic residues.&lt;ref name=Yan&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yan C, Wu F, Jernigan RL, Dobbs D, Honavar V | title = Characterization of protein-protein interfaces | journal = The Protein Journal | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–70 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17851740 | pmc = 2566606 | doi = 10.1007/s10930-007-9108-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; PPI interfaces are dynamic and frequently planar, although they can be globular and protruding as well.&lt;ref name=JonesJMB&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones S, Thornton JM | title = Analysis of protein-protein interaction sites using surface patches | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 272 | issue = 1 | pages = 121–32 | date = September 1997 | pmid = 9299342 | doi = 10.1006/jmbi.1997.1234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on three structures – [[insulin]] dimer, [[trypsin]]-pancreatic trypsin inhibitor complex, and [[oxyhaemoglobin]] – [[Cyrus Chothia]] and Joel Janin found that between 1,130 and 1,720 Å&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of surface area was removed from contact with water indicating that hydrophobicity is a major factor of stabilization of PPIs.&lt;ref name="pmid1153006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chothia C, Janin J | title = Principles of protein-protein recognition | journal = Nature | volume = 256 | issue = 5520 | pages = 705–8 | date = August 1975 | pmid = 1153006 | doi = 10.1038/256705a0 | bibcode = 1975Natur.256..705C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies refined the buried surface area of the majority of interactions to 1,600±350 Å&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. However, much larger interaction interfaces were also observed and were associated with [[Conformational change|significant changes in conformation]] of one of the interaction partners.&lt;ref name="pmid2204619" /&gt; PPIs interfaces exhibit both shape and electrostatic complementarity.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kou Qin"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin K, Dong C, Wu G, Lambert NA | title = Inactive-state preassembly of G(q)-coupled receptors and G(q) heterotrimers | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 10 | pages = 740–7 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21873996 | pmc = 3177959 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.642 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Methods to investigate protein–protein interactions}}

There are a multitude of methods to detect them.&lt;ref name="pmid7708014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phizicky EM, Fields S | title = Protein-protein interactions: methods for detection and analysis | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 94–123 | date = March 1995 | pmid = 7708014 | pmc = 239356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the approaches has its own strengths and weaknesses, especially with regard to the [[sensitivity and specificity]] of the method.

[[File:Principles of yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems.svg|thumb|left|Principles of yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems]]

===Yeast two-hybrid screening===

{{Main|Two-hybrid screening}}

This system was firstly described in 1989 by Fields and Song using ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' as biological model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Terentiev AA, Moldogazieva NT, Shaitan KV | title = Dynamic proteomics in modeling of the living cell.

The Y2H is based on the functional reconstitution of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 and subsequent activation of a selective reporter such as His3.  To test two proteins for interaction, two protein expression constructs are made: one protein (X) is fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DB) and a second protein (Y) is fused to the Gal4 activation domain (AD).  In the assay, yeast cells are transformed with these constructs.  Transcription of reporter genes does not occur unless bait (DB-X) and prey (AD-Y) interact with each other and form a functional Gal4 transcription factor. Thus, the interaction between proteins can be inferred by the presence of the products resultant of the reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=Jukka&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Westermarck J, Ivaska J, Corthals GL | title = Identification of protein interactions involved in cellular signaling | journal = Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 1752–63 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23481661 | pmc = 3708163 | doi = 10.1074/mcp.R113.027771 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wodak&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wodak SJ, Vlasblom J, Turinsky AL, Pu S | title = Protein-protein interaction networks: the puzzling riches | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 23 | issue = 6 | pages = 941–53 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24007795 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2013.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In cases in which the reporter gene expresses enzymes that allow the yeast to synthesize essential amino acids or nucleotides, yeast growth under selective media conditions indicates that the two proteins tested are interacting.

Despite its usefulness, the yeast two-hybrid system has limitations.  It uses yeast as main host system, which can be a problem when studying proteins that contain mammalian-specific post-translational modifications.  The number of PPIs identified is usually low because of a high false negative rate;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rajagopala SV, Sikorski P, Caufield JH, Tovchigrechko A, Uetz P | title = Studying protein complexes by the yeast two-hybrid system | journal = Methods | volume = 58 | issue = 4 | pages = 392–9 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 22841565 | pmc = 3517932 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymeth.2012.07.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, understates [[membrane proteins]], for example.&lt;ref name=Stelzl&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stelzl U, Wanker EE | title = The value of high quality protein-protein interaction networks for systems biology | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 551–8 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17055769 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2006.10.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pets&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Petschnigg J, Snider J, Stagljar I | title = Interactive proteomics research technologies: recent applications and advances | journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 50–8 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 20884196 | doi = 10.1016/j.copbio.2010.09.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In initial studies that utilized Y2H, proper controls for false positives (e.g. when DB-X activates the reporter gene without the presence of AD-Y) were frequently not done, leading to a higher than normal false positive rate.  An empirical framework must be implemented to control for these false positives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19060904 | doi=10.1038/nmeth.1280 | volume=6 | issue=1 | title=An empirical framework for binary interactome mapping | pmc=2872561 | year=2009 | journal=Nat Methods | pages=83–90 | vauthors=Venkatesan K, Rual JF, Vazquez A, Stelzl U, Lemmens I, Hirozane-Kishikawa T, Hao T, Zenkner M, Xin X, Goh KI, Yildirim MA, Simonis N, Heinzmann K, Gebreab F, Sahalie JM, Cevik S, Simon C, de Smet AS, Dann E, Smolyar A, Vinayagam A, Yu H, Szeto D, Borick H, Dricot A, Klitgord N, Murray RR, Lin C, Lalowski M, Timm J, Rau K, Boone C, Braun P, Cusick ME, Roth FP, Hill DE, Tavernier J, Wanker EE, Barabási AL, Vidal M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Limitations in lower coverage of membrane proteins have been overcoming by the emergence of yeast two-hybrid variants, such as the membrane yeast two-hybrid (MYTH)&lt;ref name="Pets" /&gt; and the split-ubiquitin system,&lt;ref name="Wodak" /&gt; which are not limited to interactions that occur in the nucleus; and, the bacterial two-hybrid system, performed in bacteria;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Battesti A, Bouveret E | title = The bacterial two-hybrid system based on adenylate cyclase reconstitution in Escherichia coli | journal = Methods | volume = 58 | issue = 4 | pages = 325–34 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 22841567 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymeth.2012.07.018 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1259473 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry===

{{Main|Mass spectrometry}}

Affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry mostly detects stable interactions and thus better indicates functional in vivo PPIs.&lt;ref name="pmid23017156|noedit"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brettner LM, Masel J | title = Protein stickiness, rather than number of functional protein-protein interactions, predicts expression noise and plasticity in yeast | journal = BMC Systems Biology | volume = 6 | page = 128 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 23017156 | pmc = 3527306 | doi = 10.1186/1752-0509-6-128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wodak" /&gt; This method starts by purification of the tagged protein, which is expressed in the cell usually at ''in vivo'' concentrations, and its interacting proteins (affinity purification). One of the most advantageous and widely used method to purify proteins with very low contaminating background is the [[tandem affinity purification]], developed by Bertrand Seraphin and Matthias Mann and respective colleagues. PPIs can then be quantitatively and qualitatively analysed by mass spectrometry using different methods: chemical incorporation, biological or metabolic incorporation (SILAC), and label-free methods.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;

'''Nucleic acid programmable protein array'''

This system was first developed by LaBaer and colleagues in 2004 by using in vitro transcription and translation system. They use DNA template encoding the gene of interest fused with GST protein, and it was immobilized in the solid surface. Anti-GST antibody and biotinylated plasmid DNA were bounded in aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES)-coated slide. BSA can improve the binding efficiency of DNA. Biotinylated plasmid DNA was bound by avidin. New protein was synthesized by using cell-free expression system i.e. rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL), and then the new protein was captured through anti-GST antibody bounded on the slide. To test protein-protein interaction, the targeted protein cDNA and query protein cDNA were immobilized in a same coated slide. By using  in vitro transcription and translation system, targeted and query protein was synthesized by the same extract. The targeted protein was bound to array by antibody coated in the slide and query protein was used to probe the array. The query protein was tagged with hemagglutinin (HA) epitope. Thus, the interaction between the two proteins was visualized with the antibody against HA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramachandran N, Hainsworth E, Bhullar B, Eisenstein S, Rosen B, Lau AY, Walter JC, LaBaer J | title = Self-assembling protein microarrays | journal = Science | volume = 305 | issue = 5680 | pages = 86–90 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15232106 | doi = 10.1126/science.1097639 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramachandran N, Raphael JV, Hainsworth E, Demirkan G, Fuentes MG, Rolfs A, Hu Y, LaBaer J | title = Next-generation high-density self-assembling functional protein arrays | language = En | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 535–8 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18469824 | pmc = 3070491 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.1210 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other potential methods===
Diverse techniques to identify PPIs have been emerging along with technology progression. These include co-immunoprecipitation, [[Microarrays|protein microarrays]], [[analytical ultracentrifugation]], [[light scattering]], [[fluorescence spectroscopy]], luminescence-based mammalian interactome mapping (LUMIER), resonance-energy transfer systems, mammalian protein–protein interaction trap, [[electro-switchable biosurfaces]], [[protein-fragment complementation assay]], as well as real-time label-free measurements by [[surface plasmon resonance]],  and [[calorimetry]].&lt;ref name="Stelzl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pets" /&gt;

=== Computational Prediction of Protein-Protein Interactions ===

==== Genomic Context Methods ====
[[File:Rosetta_Stone_Method.png|thumb|'''Figure A'''. Genes of the same color are homologous. Gene P1 in Genome 1 is an illustration of a fused domain or Rosetta Stone sequence. The red portion of P1 is identical in sequence to genes P3 and P5 and the green portion is identical to P2 and P4. Therefore, genes P3 and P2 in Genome 2 are predicted to interact and their respective homologues, P5 and P4, in Genome 3 are predicted to interact.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raman|first=Karthik|date=2010-02-15|title=Construction and analysis of protein–protein interaction networks|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2834675/|journal=Automated Experimentation|volume=2|pages=2|doi=10.1186/1759-4499-2-2|issn=1759-4499|pmc=2834675|pmid=20334628}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''The Rosetta Stone or Domain Fusion method'' is based on the hypothesis that if two or more separate proteins in a genome can be identified as fused into one single protein in the same or another genome, then they are likely functionally related.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An example of this is the dihydro-folate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) enzyme, which is found as one protein in ''Plasmodium falcip''arum but as two separate proteins in the human genome. The enzyme has dihydro-folate reductase (DHFR) activity at its [[N-terminus|N-terminal]] and thymidylate synthase activity (TS) at its [[C-terminus|C-terminal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Date|first=Shailesh V.|date=2008|title=The Rosetta stone method|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18712302|journal=Methods in Molecular Biology|volume=453|pages=169–180|doi=10.1007/978-1-60327-429-6_7|issn=1064-3745|pmid=18712302}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to identify these sequences, a [[Homology (biology)|sequence similarity]] algorithm such as the one used by [[BLAST]] is necessary. For example, if we had the amino acid sequences of proteins A and B and the amino acid sequences of all proteins in a certain genome, we could check each protein in that genome for non-overlapping regions of sequence similarity to both proteins A and B. '''Figure A''' illustrates a hypothetical instance of domain fusion, in which proteins of the same color are [[Sequence homology|homologous]]. Proteins P2 and P3 in Genome 2 and proteins P4 and P5 in Genome 3 are predicted to interact because protein P1 in Genome 1 has a distinct region of sequence similarity with P2 and P4 (colored green) as well as a distinct region of sequence similarity to P3 and P5 (colored red).

''The Conserved Neighborhood method'' is based on the hypothesis that if genes encoding two proteins are neighbors on a chromosome in many genomes, then they are likely functionally related.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The method is based on an observation by Bork et al. of gene pair conservation across nine bacterial and archaeal genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1998-09-01|title=Conservation of gene order: a fingerprint of proteins that physically interact|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000498012742|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|language=en|volume=23|issue=9|pages=324–328|doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(98)01274-2|issn=0968-0004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method is most effective in prokaryotes with [[operon]]s, as the organization of genes in an operon is generally related to function. '''Figure B''' illustrates a hypothetical instance of conserved gene neighborhoods, where genes A and B are co-localized in four different genomes indicating that they are likely functionally related.

''The Phylogenetic Profile method'' is based on the hypothesis that if two or more proteins are concurrently present or absent across several genomes, then they are likely functionally related.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Phylogenetic profiles of proteins can be represented as a list of numbers, where a 1 indicates presence and a 0 indicates absence. '''Figure C''' illustrates a hypothetical situation in which proteins A and B are identified as functionally linked due to their identical phylogenetic profiles across 5 different genomes. Protein Link Explorer (PLEX) is a database that can be used to construct a phylogenetic profile for any given sequence across 89 genomes in the database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Date|first=Shailesh V.|last2=Marcotte|first2=Edward M.|date=2005-05-15|title=Protein function prediction using the Protein Link EXplorer (PLEX)|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15701682|journal=Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)|volume=21|issue=10|pages=2558–2559|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/bti313|issn=1367-4803|pmid=15701682}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, PLEX can be used to investigate domain fusion and conserved neighborhoods between proteins.

===Text mining methods===
[[File:Text mining protocol.png|thumb|500px|Text mining protocol.]]
Publicly available information from biomedical documents is readily accessible through the internet and is becoming a powerful resource for collecting known protein-protein interactions (PPIs), PPI prediction and protein docking. Text mining is much less costly and time-consuming compared to other high-throughput techniques. Currently, text mining methods generally detect binary relations between interacting proteins from individual sentences using rule/pattern-based information extraction and [[machine learning]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Badal VD, Kundrotas PJ, Vakser IA | title = Text Mining for Protein Docking | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 12 | pages = e1004630 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26650466 | pmc = 4674139 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004630 | bibcode = 2015PLSCB..11E4630B }}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide variety of text mining applications for PPI extraction and/or prediction are available for public use, as well as repositories which often store manually validated and/or computationally predicted PPIs. Text mining can be implemented in two stages: ''information retrieval'', where texts containing names of either or both interacting proteins are retrieved and ''information extraction,'' where targeted information (interacting proteins, implicated residues, interaction types, etc.) is extracted.

There are also studies using phylogenetic profiling, basing their functionalities on the theory that proteins involved in common pathways co-evolve in a correlated fashion across species. Some more complex text mining methodologies use advanced [[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP) techniques and build knowledge networks (for example, considering gene names as nodes and verbs as edges). Other developments involve kernel methods to predict protein interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Papanikolaou N, Pavlopoulos GA, Theodosiou T, Iliopoulos I | title = Protein-protein interaction predictions using text mining methods | journal = Methods | volume = 74 | pages = 47–53 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25448298 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymeth.2014.10.026 | series = Text mining of biomedical literature }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Machine learning methods===
These methods use machine learning to distinguish how interacting protein pairs differ from non-interacting protein pairs in terms of pairwise features such as cellular colocalization, gene co-expression, how closely located on a DNA are the genes that encode the two proteins, and so on.&lt;ref name="mkgNPJS"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ganapathiraju MK, Thahir M, Handen A, Sarkar SN, Sweet RA, Nimgaonkar VL, Loscher CE, Bauer EM, Chaparala S | title = Schizophrenia interactome with 504 novel protein-protein interactions | journal = NPJ Schizophrenia | volume = 2 | page = 16012 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27336055 | pmc = 4898894 | doi = 10.1038/npjschz.2016.12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yqProteomics"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qi Y, Dhiman HK, Bhola N, Budyak I, Kar S, Man D, Dutta A, Tirupula K, Carr BI, Grandis J, Bar-Joseph Z, Klein-Seetharaman J | title = Systematic prediction of human membrane receptor interactions | journal = Proteomics | volume = 9 | issue = 23 | pages = 5243–55 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19798668 | pmc = 3076061 | doi = 10.1002/pmic.200900259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Random Forest]] has been found to be most-effective machine learning method for protein interaction prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qi Y, Bar-Joseph Z, Klein-Seetharaman J | title = Evaluation of different biological data and computational classification methods for use in protein interaction prediction | journal = Proteins | volume = 63 | issue = 3 | pages = 490–500 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16450363 | pmc = 3250929 | doi = 10.1002/prot.20865 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods have been applied for discovering protein interactions on human interactome, specifically the interactome of [[Membrane proteins]]&lt;ref name="yqProteomics"/&gt; and the interactome of Schizophrenia-associated proteins.&lt;ref name="mkgNPJS"/&gt;

== Databases ==
Large scale identification of PPIs generated hundreds of thousands interactions, which were collected together in specialized [[biological databases]] that are continuously updated in order to provide complete [[interactomes]]. The first of these databases was the [[Database of Interacting Proteins|Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP)]].&lt;ref name="pmid10592249"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xenarios I, Rice DW, Salwinski L, Baron MK, Marcotte EM, Eisenberg D | title = DIP: the database of interacting proteins | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 289–91 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10592249 | pmc = 102387 | doi = 10.1093/nar/28.1.289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, the number of public databases has been increasing. Databases can be subdivided into primary databases, meta-databases, and prediction databases.&lt;ref name="Rivas"/&gt;

''Primary databases'' collect information about published PPIs proven to exist via small-scale or large-scale experimental methods. Examples: [[Database of Interacting Proteins|DIP]], [[Biomolecular Interaction Network Database]] (BIND), Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets ([[BioGRID]]), Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD), IntAct Molecular Interaction Database, Molecular Interactions Database (MINT), MIPS Protein Interaction Resource on Yeast (MIPS-MPact), and MIPS Mammalian Protein–Protein Interaction Database (MIPS-MPPI).&lt;ref name="Rivas" /&gt;

''Meta-databases'' normally result from the integration of primary databases information, but can also collect some original data. Examples: Agile Protein Interactomes Dataserver (APID),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alonso-López D, Gutiérrez MA, Lopes KP, Prieto C, Santamaría R, De Las Rivas J | title = APID interactomes: providing proteome-based interactomes with controlled quality for multiple species and derived networks | language = en | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 44 | issue = W1 | pages = W529–35 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27131791 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkw363 | pmc=4987915}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Microbial Protein Interaction Database (MPIDB),&lt;ref name="GollRajagopala2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goll J, Rajagopala SV, Shiau SC, Wu H, Lamb BT, Uetz P | title = MPIDB: the microbial protein interaction database | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 24 | issue = 15 | pages = 1743–4 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18556668 | pmc = 2638870 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btn285 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protein Interaction Network Analysis (PINA) platform, (GPS-Prot),&lt;ref name="Fahey M"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fahey M, Brewer, M | title = GPS-Prot: A web-based visualization platform for integrating host-pathogen interaction data | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 12 | pages = 238 | year = 2011 | pmc = 3213248 | pmid = 21777475 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-12-298 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wiki-Pi.&lt;ref name="Ganapathiraju MK"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Orii N, Ganapathiraju MK | title = Wiki-pi: a web-server of annotated human protein-protein interactions to aid in discovery of protein function | journal = PLOS One | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = e49029 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23209562 | pmc = 3509123 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0049029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Prediction databases'' include many PPIs that are predicted using several techniques (main article). Examples: Human Protein–Protein Interaction Prediction Database (PIPs),&lt;ref name="McDowallScott2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McDowall MD, Scott MS, Barton GJ | title = PIPs: human protein-protein interaction prediction database | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 37 | issue = Database issue | pages = D651–6 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 18988626 | pmc = 2686497 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkn870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interlogous Interaction Database (I2D), [[STRING|Known and Predicted Protein–Protein Interactions (STRING-db)]], and Unified Human Interactive (UniHI).&lt;ref name="Rivas" /&gt;

''Coverage'' differs greatly between databases. In general, primary databases have the fewest total protein interactions recorded as they do not integrate data from multiple other databases, while prediction databases have the most because they include other forms of evidence in addition to experimental. For example, the primary database IntAct has 572,063 interactions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/about/statistics?conversationContext=2|title=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/about/statistics?conversationContext=2|last=IntAct|website=www.ebi.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the meta-database APID has 678,000 interactions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cicblade.dep.usal.es:8080/APID/init.action#tabr4|title=Agile Protein Interactomes DataServer: About APID|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the predictive database STRING has 25,914,693 interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://string-db.org/cgi/about.pl?footer_active_subpage=statistics|title=STRING: functional protein association networks|website=string-db.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to note that some of the interactions in the STRING database are only predicted by computational methods such as Genomic Context and not experimentally proven.

== Interaction networks ==
{{main|Interactome}}
&lt;!--[[Image:Human interactome.jpg|thumb|Network visualisation of the human [[interactome]] where each point represents a protein and each blue line between them is an interaction.|200px]]--&gt;
[[File:Schziophrenia PPI.jpg|400px|right|thumb | Schizophrenia PPI.&lt;ref name="mkgNPJS"/&gt;]]
Information found in PPIs databases supports the construction of interaction networks. Although the PPI network of a given query protein can be represented in textbooks, diagrams of whole cell PPIs are frankly complex and difficult to generate.

One example of a manually produced molecular interaction map is the Kurt Kohn's 1999 map of cell cycle control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwikowski B, Uetz P, Fields S | title = A network of protein-protein interactions in yeast | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 18 | issue = 12 | pages = 1257–61 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 11101803 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/82360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on Kohn's map, Schwikowski et al. in 2000 published a paper on PPIs in yeast, linking 1,548 interacting proteins determined by two-hybrid screening. They used a layered graph drawing method to find an initial placement of the nodes and then improved the layout using a force-based algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rigaut G, Shevchenko A, Rutz B, Wilm M, Mann M, Séraphin B | title = A generic protein purification method for protein complex characterization and proteome exploration | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 17 | issue = 10 | pages = 1030–2 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10504710 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/13732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prieto C, De Las Rivas J | title = APID: Agile Protein Interaction DataAnalyzer | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34 | issue = Web Server issue | pages = W298–302 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16845013 | pmc = 1538863 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioinformatic tools have been developed to simplify the difficult task of visualizing molecular interaction networks and complement them with other types of data. For instance, [[Cytoscape]] is an open-source software widely used and lots of plugins are currently available.&lt;ref name="Rivas" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kohl |first1=Michael |last2=Wiese |first2=Sebastian |last3=Warscheid |first3=Bettina |year=2011 | name-list-format = vanc |chapter=Cytoscape: Software for Visualization and Analysis of Biological Networks |title=Data Mining in Proteomics |doi=10.1007/978-1-60761-987-1_18 |pmid=21063955 |volume=696 |pages=291–303 |series=Methods in Molecular Biology |isbn=978-1-60761-986-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pajek software is advantageous for the visualization and analysis of very large networks.&lt;ref name=Raman&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raman K | title = Construction and analysis of protein-protein interaction networks | journal = Automated Experimentation | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | page = 2 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20334628 | pmc = 2834675 | doi = 10.1186/1759-4499-2-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identification of functional modules in PPI networks is an important challenge in bioinformatics. Functional modules means a set of proteins that are highly [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connected]] to each other in PPI network. It is almost similar problem as community detection in [[social network]]s. There are some methods such as Jactive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ideker T, Ozier O, Schwikowski B, Siegel AF | title = Discovering regulatory and signalling circuits in molecular interaction networks | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 18 Suppl 1 | pages = S233–40 | date = 2002-01-01 | pmid = 12169552 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.s233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; modules and MoBaS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = MOBAS: identification of disease-associated protein subnetworks using modularity-based scoring|journal = EURASIP Journal on Bioinformatics and Systems Biology|date = 2015-06-30|issn = 1687-4153|pages = 1–14|volume = 2015|issue = 1|doi = 10.1186/s13637-015-0025-6| pmid = 28194175|pmc = 5270451|first = Marzieh|last = Ayati|first2 = Sinan|last2 = Erten|first3 = Mark R.|last3 = Chance|first4 = Mehmet|last4 = Koyutürk | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jactive modules integrate PPI network and [[gene expression]] data where as MoBaS integrate PPI network and [[Genome-wide association study|Genome Wide association Studies]].

The awareness of the major roles of PPIs in numerous physiological and pathological processes has been driving the challenge of unravel many interactomes. Examples of published interactomes are the thyroid specific DREAM interactome&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rivas M, Villar D, González P, Dopazo XM, Mellstrom B, Naranjo JR | title = Building the DREAM interactome | journal = Science China. Life Sciences | volume = 54 | issue = 8 | pages = 786–92 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21786202 | doi = 10.1007/s11427-011-4196-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the PP1α interactome in human brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Esteves SL, Domingues SC, da Cruz e Silva OA, Fardilha M, da Cruz e Silva EF | title = Protein phosphatase 1α interacting proteins in the human brain | journal = OMICS | volume = 16 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 3–17 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22321011 | pmc = 3275796 | doi = 10.1089/omi.2011.0041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protein-protein relationships are often the result of multiple types of interactions or are deduced from different approaches, including co-localization, direct interaction, suppressive genetic interaction, additive genetic interaction, physical association, and other associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = De Domenico M, Nicosia V, Arenas A, Latora V | title = Structural reducibility of multilayer networks | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 6 | page = 6864 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25904309 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms7864 | bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E6864D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Signed interaction networks ===
[[File:Genetic interactions between Ras signalling and chromatin remodelling-A.jpg|thumb|500px|The protein protein interactions are displayed in a signed network that describes what type of interactions that are taking place&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fischer B, Sandmann T, Horn T, Billmann M, Chaudhary V, Huber W, Boutros M | title = A map of directional genetic interactions in a metazoan cell | journal = eLife | volume = 4 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25748138 | pmc = 4384530 | doi = 10.7554/eLife.05464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Protein–protein interactions often result in one of the interacting proteins either being 'activated' or 'repressed'. Such effects can be indicated in a PPI network by "signs" (e.g. "activation" or "inhibition"). Although such attributes have been added to networks for a long time,&lt;ref&gt;Ideker T., Tan K. &amp; Uetz P. (2005) Visualization and integration of protein-protein interactions. In: Golemis, E. (ed.) Protein-Protein Interactions – A Molecular Cloning Manual, 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Vinayagam et al. (2014) coined the term ''Signed network'' for them. Signed networks are often expressed by labeling the interaction as either positive or negative. A positive interaction is one where the interaction results in one of the proteins being activated. Conversely a negative interaction indicates that one of the proteins being inactivated.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vinayagam A, Zirin J, Roesel C, Hu Y, Yilmazel B, Samsonova AA, Neumüller RA, Mohr SE, Perrimon N | title = Integrating protein-protein interaction networks with phenotypes reveals signs of interactions | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 94–9 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24240319 | pmc = 3877743 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2733 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protein–protein interaction networks are often constructed as a result of lab experiments such as yeast two hybrid screens or 'affinity purification and subsequent mass spectrometry techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen GI, Gingras AC | title = Affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) of serine/threonine phosphatases | journal = Methods | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 298–305 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17532517 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymeth.2007.02.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However these methods do not provide the layer of information needed in order to determine what type of interaction is present in order to be able to attribute signs to the network diagrams.

==== RNA interference screens ====
[[RNA interference]] (RNAi) screens (repression of individual proteins between transcription and translation) are one method that can be utilized in the process of providing signs to the protein-protein interactions. Individual proteins are repressed and the resulting phenotypes are analyzed. A correlating phenotypic relationship (i.e. where the inhibition of either of two proteins results in the same phenotype) indicates a positive, or activating relationship. Phenotypes that do not correlate (i.e. where the inhibition of either of two proteins results in two different phenotypes) indicate a negative or inactivating relationship. If protein A is dependent on protein B for activation then the inhibition of either protein A or B will result in a cell losing the service that is provided by protein A and the phenotypes will be the same for the inhibition of either A or B. If, however, protein A is inactivated by protein B then the phenotypes will differ depending on which protein is inhibited (inhibit protein B and it can no longer inactivate protein A leaving A active however inactivate A and there is nothing for B to activate since A is inactive and the phenotype changes). Multiple [[RNA interference|RNAi]] screens need to be performed in order to reliably appoint a sign to a given protein-protein interaction. Vinayagam et al. who devised this technique state that a minimum of nine [[RNA interference|RNAi]] screens are required with confidence increasing as one carries out more screens.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== As therapeutic targets ==
Modulation of PPI is challenging and is receiving increasing attention by the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Laraia L, McKenzie G, Spring DR, Venkitaraman AR, Huggins DJ | title = Overcoming Chemical, Biological, and Computational Challenges in the Development of Inhibitors Targeting Protein-Protein Interactions | journal = Chemistry &amp; Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 689–703 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26091166 | pmc = 4518475 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2015.04.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several properties of PPI such as allosteric sites and hotspots, have been incorporated into drug-design strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arkin MR, Wells JA | title = Small-molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interactions: progressing towards the dream | journal = Nature Reviews.

The consensus among these promising targets is, nonetheless, denoted in the already available drugs on the market to treat a multitude of diseases. Examples are Titrobifan, inhibitor of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, used as a cardiovascular drug, and Maraviroc, inhibitor of the CCR5-gp120 interaction, used as anti-HIV drug.&lt;ref name=Ivanov&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ivanov AA, Khuri FR, Fu H | title = Targeting protein-protein interactions as an anticancer strategy | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 34 | issue = 7 | pages = 393–400 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23725674 | pmc = 3773978 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2013.04.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A backplane computer bus is a type of multilayer [[printed circuit board]] that has at least one (almost) solid layer of [[copper]] called the ground plane, and at least one layer of copper tracks that are used as wires for the signals.  Each signal travels along a [[transmission line]] formed by its track and the narrow strip of ground plane directly beneath it.  This structure is known in [[radio]] engineering as [[microstrip]] line.

Each signal travels from a transmitter to one or more receivers.  Most computer buses use [[Binary numeral system|binary]] [[Digital circuit|digital]] signals, which are sequences of pulses of fixed amplitude.  In order to receive the correct data, the receiver must detect each pulse once, and only once.  To ensure this, the designer must take the high-frequency characteristics of the microstrip into account.

When a pulse is launched into the microstrip by the transmitter, its amplitude depends on the ratio of the impedances of the transmitter and the microstrip.  The impedance of the transmitter is simply its output [[electrical resistance|resistance]].  The impedance of the microstrip is its [[characteristic impedance]], which depends on its dimensions and on the materials used in the backplane's construction.  As the leading edge of the pulse (the ''incident wave'') passes the receiver, it may or may not have sufficient amplitude to be detected.  If it does, then the system is said to use ''incident-wave switching''.  This is the system used in most computer buses predating PCI, such as the [[VMEbus|VME]] bus.

When the pulse reaches the end of the microstrip, its behaviour depends on the circuit conditions at this point.  If the microstrip is correctly [[electrical termination|terminated]] (usually with a combination of [[resistor]]s), the pulse is absorbed and its energy is converted to [[heat]].  This is the case in an incident-wave switching bus.  If, on the other hand, there is no termination at the end of the microstrip, and the pulse encounters an open circuit, it is reflected back towards its source.  As this ''reflected wave'' travels back along the microstrip, its amplitude is added to that of the original pulse.  As the reflected wave passes the receiver for a second time, this time from the opposite direction, it now has enough amplitude to be detected.  This is what happens in a ''reflected-wave switching'' bus.  

In incident-wave switching buses, reflections from the end of the bus are undesirable and must be prevented by adding termination.  Terminating an incident-wave trace varies in complexity from a DC-balanced, AC-coupled termination to a single resistor series terminator, but all incident wave terminations consume both power and space (Johnson and Graham, 1993). However, incident-wave switching buses can be significantly longer than reflected-wave switching buses operating at the same frequency.

If the limited bus length is acceptable, a reflected-wave switching bus will use less power, and fewer components to operate at a given frequency. The bus has to be short enough, such that a pulse may travel twice the length of the backplane (one complete journey for the incident wave, and another for the reflected wave), and stabilize sufficiently to be read in a single bus cycle. The travel time can be calculated by dividing the round-trip length of the bus by the speed of propagation of the signal (which is roughly one half to two-thirds of ''c'', the [[speed of light]] in vacuum).

[[File:Lindos4.svg|thumb|400px|right]]

The '''Robinson–Dadson curves''' are one of many sets of [[equal-loudness contours]] for the [[human ear]], determined experimentally by D. W. Robinson and R. S. Dadson, and reported in a paper entitled "A re-determination of the equal-loudness relations for pure tones" in Br. J. Appl. Phys. 7, 166-181 (1956).

Until recently, it was common to see the term '[[Fletcher–Munson curves|Fletcher–Munson]]' used to refer to equal-loudness contours generally, even though the re-determination carried out by Robinson and Dadson in 1956, became the basis for an ISO standard ISO 226 which was only revised recently.

It is now better to use the term '[[Equal-loudness contours]]' as the generic term, especially as a recent survey by ISO redefined the curves in a new standard, ISO 226 :2003.

According to the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] report, the Robinson-Dadson results were the odd one out, differing more from the current standard than did the [[Fletcher–Munson curves]]. It comments that it is fortunate that the 40-Phon Fletcher-Munson curve on which the [[A-weighting]] standard was based turns out to have been in good agreement with modern determinations.

The article also comments on the large differences apparent in the low-frequency region, which remain unexplained. Possible explanations are:

* The equipment used was not properly calibrated.
* The criteria used for judging equal loudness (which is tricky) differed.
* Different races actually vary greatly in this respect (possible, and most recent determinations were by the Japanese).
* Subjects were not properly rested for days in advance, or were exposed to loud noise in travelling to the tests which tensed the tensor timpani and stapedius muscles controlling low-frequency mechanical coupling.

'''Sense about Science''' is a UK charity that promotes the [[Public awareness of science|public understanding of science]]. Sense about Science was founded in 2002 by [[Lord Taverne]], [[Bridget Ogilvie]] and others to promote respect for [[scientific evidence]] and [[Scientific method|good science]]. Sense about Science was established as a [[charitable trust]] in 2003, with 14 trustees, an advisory council and a small office staff. Tracey Brown has been the director since 2002.&lt;ref name="Team" /&gt;

Sense about Science aims to work with scientists, journalists and others to ensure that scientific evidence is at the forefront of public discussions about science, and to correct unscientific [[misinformation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/workshops.html Sense About Science 'Voice of Young Science' workshop], "Ellen Raphael talked about Sense about Science, discussing projects and the ways we correct misinformation with examples from the last five years."&lt;/ref&gt; They encourage and assist scientists to engage in public debates about their area of [[expert]]ise, to respond to scientifically inaccurate claims in the media, to help people contact scientists with appropriate expertise, and to prepare briefings about the scientific background to issues of public concern.

Sense about Science maintains database of over 6,000 UK scientists willing to use their expertise to help inform public debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About us ·  Sense about Science|url = http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/about-us.html|website = www.senseaboutscience.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also runs the ''Voice of Young'' Science programme to help early career scientists engage in public debates. Sense About Science hosts an annual lecture.

Since its founding, Sense about Science has contributed to UK public debates about such subjects as [[alternative medicine]], [[Detoxification (alternative medicine)|"detoxification" products]] and [[detox diet]]s, [[genetically modified food]], [[avian influenza]], [[chemicals]] and health, "[[electrosmog]]", [[MMR vaccine controversy|vaccination]], weather and [[Climate change|climate]], [[nuclear power]], and the use and utility of [[peer review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/health-and-medicine.html |title=Health &amp; Medicine |publisher=Sense About Science |accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sense about Science encourages scientists to explain to the public the value of peer review in determining which reports should be taken seriously. Director Tracey Brown describes such critical thinking as crucial to preventing public [[Alarmism|health scares]] based on unpublished information.&lt;ref name=Butler2004&gt;{{Cite journal |

===The John Maddox Prize{{anchor|John Maddox Prize}}===
Sense about Science also promotes the ''[[John Maddox]] Prize'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The John Maddox Prize · Sense about Science|url = http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/john-maddox-prize.html|website = www.senseaboutscience.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The John Maddox Prize for standing up for science rewards an individual who has promoted sound science and evidence on a matter of public interest. Its emphasis is on those who have faced difficulty or hostility in doing so. Nominations of active researchers who have yet to receive recognition for their public-interest work are particularly welcomed. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Past winners are: 
* 2012 [[Simon Wessely]] and [[Fang Zhouzi]] 
* 2013 [[David Nutt]] 
* 2014 [[Emily Willingham]] and [[David Robert Grimes]] 
* 2015 [[Edzard Ernst]] and [[Susan Jebb]] 
* 2016 [[Elizabeth Loftus]]
* 2017 [[Riko Muranaka]]
* 2018 [[Terry Hughes (scientist)|Terry Hughes]] and [[Britt Hermes]]

== Supported causes and campaigns ==
[[File:AskForEvidence-Logo resize.jpg|thumb|Sense About Science launched the Ask for Evidence campaign in 2011 to help people request for themselves the evidence behind news stories, marketing claims and policies.&lt;ref name="Ask for Evidence"&gt;{{cite web|title = Ask for Evidence|url = http://askforevidence.org/about|website = Ask for Evidence|accessdate = 2015-11-17|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== AllTrials ===
{{main article|AllTrials}}
The [[AllTrials]] campaign calls for all past and present clinical trials to be registered and their full methods and summary results reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = What does all trials registered and reported mean?|url = http://www.alltrials.net/find-out-more/all-trials/|website = AllTrials|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AllTrials campaign. 2017. Alltrials Roadmap http://www.alltrials.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/AllTrials-Roadmap.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

AllTrials is an international initiative of [[Bad Science (book)|Bad Science]], ''[[The BMJ|BMJ]]'', [[Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine|Centre for Evidence-based Medicine]], [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane Collaboration]], James Lind Initiative, ''[[PLOS]]'' and Sense About Science and is being led in the US by Sense About Science USA, Dartmouth’s [[Geisel School of Medicine]] and the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy &amp; Clinical Practice.&lt;ref name="alltrials.net"&gt;{{cite web|title = All Trials Registered. All Results Reported|url = http://www.alltrials.net/|website = AllTrials|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2018, the AllTrials petition has been signed by 91,989 people and 737 organisations.&lt;ref name="alltrials.net"/&gt;

=== Ask for Evidence ===
Ask for Evidence was launched by Sense About Science in 2011. It is a campaign that helps people request for themselves the evidence behind news stories, marketing claims and policies.&lt;ref name="Ask for Evidence"/&gt; When challenged in this way, organisations may withdraw their claims or send evidence to support them.  The campaign is supported by more than 6000 volunteer scientists who are available to review the evidence provided and determine whether it supports the original claim or story.&lt;ref name="ESP20"&gt;{{cite web|title=Episode #020, feat. Chris Peters|url=https://soundcloud.com/user-721155342/theesp-ep-020-chris-peters#t=00:00|website=The [[European Skeptics Podcast]]|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign has received funding from The [[Wellcome Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Empowering people to 'Ask for Evidence'|url = http://blog.wellcome.ac.uk/2015/10/13/empowering-people-to-ask-for-evidence/|website = Wellcome Trust Blog|accessdate = 2015-11-17|first = Kate Arkless|last = Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is endorsed by figures such as [[Dara Ó Briain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Ask for Evidence {{!}} Dara Ó Briain, performer|url = http://askforevidence.org/articles/dara-o-briain-performer|website = Ask for Evidence|accessdate = 2015-11-17|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Derren Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Ask for Evidence {{!}} Derren Brown, illusionist|url = http://askforevidence.org/articles/derren-brown-illusionist|website = Ask for Evidence|accessdate = 2015-11-17|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Peters, Scientific Affairs Manager at Sense About Science, has said, 'If you ask people for evidence then they expect to be asked for evidence in the future'.&lt;ref name="ESP20"/&gt;  This can lead to a cultural shift in the organisation; they make sure they have the evidence from the start and are more evidence-based.

=== Keep Libel Laws Out of Science ===
Sense About Science  launched the Keep Libel Laws out of Science campaign in June 2009&lt;ref name="SAScience"&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/keep-libel-laws-out-of-science.html Sign up now to keep the libel laws out of science!] ''Sense About Science''&lt;/ref&gt; in defence of a member of its board of trustees,&lt;ref name="SAS_Board"&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/board-of-trustees.html Board of Trustees,] ''Sense About Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; author and journalist [[Simon Singh]], who has been sued for [[libel]] by the [[British Chiropractic Association]]. They issued a statement entitled "The law has no place in scientific disputes",&lt;ref name="Statement"&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/the-world-conference-of-science-journalists.html "The law has no place in scientific disputes"], ''Sense about Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; which was signed by many people representing science, medicine, journalism, publishing, arts, humanities, entertainment, sceptics, campaign groups and law. In April 2010, the BCA lost this case&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE63018820100401 | work=Reuters | title=Science writer wins "fair comment" libel appeal | first=Michael | last=Holden | date=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the court accepting that criticism of the BCA concerning its promotion of bogus treatments was [[fair comment]].

In December 2009, Sense About Science, [[Index on Censorship]] and [[English PEN]] launched the Libel Reform Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Launch of the Libel Reform Campaign ·  Sense about Science|url = http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/launch-of-the-libel-reform-campaign.html|website = www.senseaboutscience.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Defamation Act 2013]] received Royal Assent on 25 April 2013 and came into force on 1 January 2014.

The Trust actively campaigns in support of various causes. It has issued a statement signed by over 35 scientists&lt;ref name="Letter to WHO"&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/docs/VOYSlettertoWHO.doc Letter to WHO, signed by at least 35 scientists], ''Sense About Science''&lt;/ref&gt; asking the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] to condemn [[homeopathy]] for diseases such as HIV.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;Sample, Ian (1 June 2009).[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jun/01/world-health-organisation-homeopathy-hiv "British scientists ask WHO to condemn homeopathy for diseases such as HIV"].

&lt;!--(No good references available for this piece)-Sense About Science organised a  climate change conference,&lt;ref name=climate/&gt; which resulted in stories warning against the exaggeration and 'Hollywoodisation' of climate change, and the publication of a report "Making Sense of Climate Change". The authors of this report said they firmly believe global warming is happening and man-made emissions of greenhouse gases are a significant cause. But warned that exaggeration of the problems confused the public and made it easier to argue that the scientists were wrong.

Homeopath [[Peter Fisher (physician)|Peter Fisher]] criticised Sense About Science, who have been working closely with [[NHS primary care trust]]s on the issue of funding for homeopathy, for being funded by the pharmaceutical industry; SAS responded in a statement to [[Channel 4 News]] that "Peter Fisher's desperate comments show about as much grasp of reality as the homeopathic medicine he sells."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|

== Funding ==

Sense about Science's principal funding is through grants and donations in respect of its core aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Charity overview|url = http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1146170&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its funding policy it states: "Donations do not entitle any individual or organisation to decision-making authority. External funding will not divert Sense About Science from its agreed aims and values".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Our funding policy ·  Sense about Science|url = http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/our-funding-policy.html|website = www.senseaboutscience.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for the trust has been increasing. Some is derived from industrial organizations engaged in scientific dispute, clinical trials and research for which SAS is supportive (e.g. genetically modified crops) as well as major publishing houses. For example, for the fiscal year ending 5 April 2008, the trust received £145,902 in donations. Disclosed corporate donations comprised £88,000 with pharmaceutical company [[Astra Zeneca]] donating £35,000.&lt;ref name="2008-2010_FiscalStatements"&gt;[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1101114&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 "Sense About Science Financial Statements"], Charity Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; Previous donations included other [[pharmaceutical lobby|pharmaceutical]] industries such as [[Pfizer]].&lt;ref name="2008-2010_FiscalStatements" /&gt; This dependency has now been diminished since for the fiscal year ending April 2010, the trust received £183,971 in donations of which £17,500 was derived from the pharmaceutical industry (Unilever and G E Healthcare). In 2011 the amount diminished further to less than 6% funding derived from industry sources (the trust received £268,184 in donations with £15,000 from industry)  with the rest derived from Science Bodies and individuals.&lt;ref name="2008-2010_FiscalStatements" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2010-2011 fiscal statement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial Statements 2011|url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1101114&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|publisher=Charity Commission|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sense about Science discloses the names of its funders and the purpose of each donation received in its annual reports. Its largest donor during 2015-16 was the [[Laura and John Arnold Foundation]], which donated between £40,001-50,000 to support the [[AllTrials]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Sense about Science, Annual Review 2015/16, http://senseaboutscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Annual-Report-2015-16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[heterosexual]] [[anal sex]], splash conception occurs when [[semen]] containing [[spermatozoon|sperm]] migrates from the [[anus]], across the [[perineum]], to the [[labia (genitalia)|labia]], and subsequently into the [[vagina]], causing the fertilization of an [[ovum]] followed by [[Conception (biology)|conception]] or [[pregnancy]].  This migration does not occur by virtue of the spermatozoa's tail propulsion, but rather due to gravity or other kinetic forces (such as that of a penis pulling out of an anus and dragging semen left on the tip, or being expelled from the anus due to said penis's recent ejaculation, across the perineum and onto the labia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2644">'''Timken OK Load''' is a standardized measurement that indicates the possible performance of [[extreme pressure additive|extreme pressure (EP) additives]] in a [[lubricant|lubricating grease or oil]].  The units of measurement are [[pound-force|pounds-force]] or [[kilogram-force|kilograms-force]]. This measurement is performed using a special test machine and standard block and ring test specimens.

The test machine is based on a machine manufactured by the [[Timken Company]] from 1935 to 1972,&lt;ref name = timken/&gt; It is now an industry recognized standard test to compare extreme pressure resistance of greases and oils in a reproducible way.

''It is not to be confused with some smaller, sales man's demonstrator, 'lubricity' testers that are also often called erroneously Timken or Falex test. The confusion originates from a now obsolete Italian brand of such small lubricity testers, namely 'TIMPKEN').''

The test machine consists of a standardized bearing race mounted on a tapered [[Mandrel|arbor]] rotating at high speed.  The race is brought into contact with a square steel test block under a constant load.  The contact area is flooded with the lubricant or grease being tested.  The Timken OK Load is the highest standard load at which the spinning bearing race produces no scouring mark on the test block, but only a uniform wear scar.&lt;ref name = timken/&gt;

Timken OK Loads are listed on grease and oil property charts and are part of many specifications.  It was once generally assumed that the measure and the film strength of the lubricant were directly related.  Today, the primary purpose of the test is to determine whether EP additives are present and functioning.  A measure of 35 pounds (16 kilograms-force or 155 newtons) or more means that EP additives are present and working well.&lt;ref name=timken&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.timken.com/en-us/products/lubrication/Pages/faq.aspx | title = Lubrication: Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = Timken | accessdate = 2015-07-24 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150725205013/http://www.timken.com/en-us/products/lubrication/Pages/faq.aspx | archivedate = 2015-07-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Timken OK Load test methods are [[ASTM International|ASTM]] D-2509 for greases and ASTM D-2782 for oils.

There are a few portable version of smaller tester utilizing similar test method for public demonstration or for product showcase. Example of smaller and portable version: www.linhphan.vn/timken

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8018">A [[Routing|routing algorithm]] decides the path followed by a [[Network packet|packet]] from the source to destination [[Router (computing)|routers]] in a [[Computer network|network]]. An important aspect to be considered while designing a routing algorithm is avoiding a [[deadlock]]. '''Turn restriction routing'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=fundamentals of parallel computer architecture|last=Solihin|first=Yan|publisher=solihin books|year=2016|isbn=9780984163007|location=|pages=390–392|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CHRISTOPHER J.

All packets in output buffers are to be forwarded to next channel. But since their input buffers are full, this forwarding cannot take place. As a result, no packet can be moved any further. This results in a deadlock.|389x389px]]

== Reason for deadlock ==
A deadlock (shown in fig 1) is a situation in which no further transportation of packets can take place due to the saturation of network resources like [[Data buffer|buffers]] or [[Data link|links]]. The main reason for a deadlock&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=fundamentals of parallel computer architecture|last=Solihin|first=Yan|publisher=solihin books|year=2016|isbn=9780984163007|location=|pages=388–389|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the cyclic acquisition of [[Channel (communications)|channels]] in the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Distributed Systems Concepts and Design|last=Coulouris|first=George|publisher=Pearson|year=2012|isbn=978-0-273-76059-7|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider there are four channels in a network. Four packets have filled up the input buffers of these four channels and needs to be forwarded to the next channel. Now assume that the output buffers of all these channels are also filled with packets that need to be transmitted to the next channel. If these four channels form a cycle, it is impossible to transmit packets any further because the output buffers and input buffers of all channels are already full. This is known as cyclic acquisition of channels and this results in a deadlock.

== Solution to deadlock ==
Deadlocks can either be [[Deadlock#Detection|detected]], broken or [[Deadlock prevention algorithms|avoided]] from happening altogether.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=fundamentals of parallel computer architecture|last=Solihin|first=Yan|publisher=solihin books|year=2016|isbn=9780984163007|location=|page=390|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detecting and breaking deadlocks in the network is expensive in terms of [[Network latency|latency]] and resources. So an easy and inexpensive solution is to avoid deadlocks by choosing routing techniques that prevent cyclic acquisition of channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havender|first=James W|year=1968|title=Avoiding deadlock in multitasking systems|url=http://domino.research.ibm.com/tchjr/journalindex.nsf/a3807c5b4823c53f85256561006324be/c014b699abf7b9ea85256bfa00685a38?OpenDocument|journal=IBM Systems Journal|volume=7|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:All turns.jpg|thumb|Fig 2: All possible turns in a network route- clockwise and anti-clockwise.|390x390px]]

== Logic behind turn restriction routing ==
Logic behind turn restriction routing derives from a key observation. A cyclic acquisition of channels can take place only if all the four possible clockwise (or anti-clockwise) turns have occurred. This means deadlocks can be avoided by prohibiting at least one of the clockwise turns and one of the anti-clockwise turns. All the clockwise and anti-clockwise turns that are possible in a non restricted routing algorithm are shown in fig 2.
[[File:XY Turns.jpg|thumb|Fig 3: Dimension-ordered (X-Y) routing|390x390px]]

== Examples of turn restriction routing ==
A turn restriction routing can be obtained by prohibiting at least one of the four possible clockwise turns and at least one of the four possible anti-clockwise turns in the routing algorithm. This means there are at least 16 (4x4)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; possible turn restriction routing techniques as you have 4 clockwise turns and 4 anti-clockwise turns to choose from. Some of these techniques have been listed below.[[File:West First Turns.jpg|thumb|Fig 4: West first routing|390x390px]][[File:North Last Turns.jpg|thumb|Fig 5: North last routing|390x390px]][[File:Negative First Turns.jpg|thumb|Fig 6: Negative first routing|390x390px]]

=== Dimension-ordered (X-Y) routing===
Dimension ordered (X-Y) routing&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (shown in fig 3) restricts all turns from y-dimension to x-dimension. This prohibits two anti-clockwise and two clockwise turns which is more than what is actually required. Even then since it restricts the number of turns that are allowed we can tell that this is an example for turn restriction routing.

=== West first routing===
West first routing&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (shown in fig 4) restricts all turns to the west direction. This means west direction should be taken first if needed in the proposed route.

=== North last routing===
North last routing&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of parallel computer architecture|last=Solihin|first=Yan|publisher=Solihin books|year=2016|isbn=9780984163007|location=|pages=390–391|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (shown in fig 5) restricts turning to any other direction if the current direction is north. This means north direction should be taken last if needed in the proposed route.

=== Negative first routing ===
Negative first routing&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; (shown in fig 6) restricts turning to a negative direction while the current direction is positive. West is considered as the negative direction in X-dimension and south is considered as the negative direction in Y-dimension. This means any [[Network hop|hop]] in one of the negative directions should be taken before taking any other turn.

== Advantages of turn restriction routing==
* Avoiding deadlocks is less expensive to implement than deadlock detecting and breaking techniques.
* Turn restrictions provide alternate [[Shortest path problem|minimum length paths]] as well as non minimum length paths from one node to another, which allows routing around [[Network congestion|congested]] or failed links.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=fundamentals of parallel computer architecture|last=Solihin|first=Yan|publisher=solihin books|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=392|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, consider figure 7 below. Say there are multiple routers, F1, F2 etc., that feed packets to a congested, but low-cost link from source router S to destination router D. Implementing Turn restriction routing means that some of the turns from any of the feeder routers to the congested router S may now be restricted. Those feeder routers may have to use a longer path to get to destination D, thereby decongesting the link from S to D to an extend.

Underwood, an anatomist at [[King's College London|King's College]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name="UNDER"&gt;Underwood, AS. &lt;u&gt;An inquiry into the anatomy and pathology of the maxillary sinus&lt;/u&gt;. ''J Anat Physiol'' 1910;44:354-369.&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of septa at or near the floor of the sinus are of interest to the [[dentist|dental clinician]] when proposing or performing [[sinus lift|sinus floor elevation procedures]] because of an increased likelihood of [[surgical complication]]s, such as tearing of the [[Schneiderian membrane]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyne, P; James, RA. &lt;u&gt;Grafting of the maxillary sinus floor with autogenous marrow and bone&lt;/u&gt;. ''J Oral Maxillofac Surg'' 1980;38:113–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[prevalence]] of Underwood's septa in relation to the floor of the maxillary sinus has been reported at nearly 32%.&lt;ref name="ULM"&gt;Ulm, CW, et al. &lt;u&gt;Incidence and suggested surgical management of septa in sinus-lift procedures&lt;/u&gt;. ''Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants'' 1995;10:462–465.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location of septa in the sinus==
Underwood divided the maxillary sinus into three regions relating to zones of distinct tooth eruption activity: anterior (corresponding to the premolars), middle (corresponding to the first molar) and posterior (corresponding to the second molar).  Thus, he asserted, these septa always arise between teeth and never opposite the middle of a tooth.&lt;ref name="UNDER"/&gt;

Different studies reveal a different predisposition for the presence of septa based on sinus region:

==Primary vs. secondary septa==
Recent studies have classified two types of maxillary sinus septa: primary and secondary.  ''Primary septa'' are those initially described by Underwood and that form as a result of the floor of the sinus sinking along with the roots of [[tooth eruption|erupting teeth]]; these primary septa are thus generally found in the sinus corresponding to the space between teeth, as explained by Underwood.  Conversely, ''secondary septa'' form as a result of irregular pneumatization of the sinus following loss of maxillary posterior teeth.&lt;ref name="KRENNMAIR"/&gt;  ''Sinus pneumatization'' is a poorly understood phenomenon that results in an increased volume of the maxillary sinus, generally following maxillary posterior tooth loss, at the expense of the bone which used to house the roots of the maxillary posterior teeth.
